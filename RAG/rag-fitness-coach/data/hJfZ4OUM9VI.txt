because pretty much every single video
this guy puts out is full of
misinformation and really does nothing
except
mislead people and promote garbage
products in the process
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and yes the man himself our favorite
elite level
world-class fitness expert v shred has
finally made his long-awaited return
to youtube what's going on guys not that
he ever really left
he basically just spent the past year or
so away from regular videos and running
his
insanely annoying paid ads promoting
[ __ ] concepts like somatotypes
how come it feels like some people can
eat anything they want and still
look great while you gain a pound from
just looking
at a restaurant menu i'll tell you why
it's called soma types
soma types sugar tarps and i didn't just
make that word up
top secret diet hacks based around the
thermic effect of food
the nuclear bomb for weight loss
is adding certain foods that have an
insanely high
thermic effect i'm not gonna lie i don't
know what the hell i'm talking about and
my all-time favorite
which is the hidden biological fat
burning loophole
discovered by harvard scientists which
drains fat cells
puts metabolism on overdrive and burns
pounds of fat
24 7. which then just turns out to be a
sales pitch
for a worthless 40 bottle of fat loss
pills harvard researchers have found
what they're calling a biological
loophole that takes just 30 seconds
first thing in the morning
that can help crank up even the slowest
of metabolisms and help promote calorie
burning all day long the lie detector
test determined that was a lie
this biological loophole they discovered
is something that forces your body to
start burning up
all your stored fat at once in fact this
new discovery even targets your body's
deepest fat stores the lie detector test
determined that was a lie
the truth comes down to one word
metabolism a slow metabolism will drag
fat burning to a screeching home even if
you do plenty of cardio and count every
calorie
and sleep eight hours a night and that's
a very common and very crappy position
to be in
each time a snake whips out its tongue
it captures chemicals from the air or
water and carries them back in look
v shred doesn't know what he's talking
about but he's pretty good at reading a
prompter
he doesn't research this he doesn't know
any of it he just
is an actor the lie detector test
determined that you are telling the
truth
now on the one hand i was glad to see
that he hadn't made any regular youtube
videos
in almost a year because pretty much
every single video this guy puts out
is full of misinformation and really
does nothing except mislead people and
promote garbage products in the process
you know maybe that sounds a bit harsh
but it's really just the honest truth
whether people like hearing it or
not but on the other hand i was also
kind of disappointed
since his videos do provide so many
great content creating opportunities
because they can be used as an example
of what not to do and to help educate
viewers in the process
to make sure they're getting the right
information to reach their goals which
is ultimately what this is all about
okay it's about helping you
achieve your health and fitness goals in
the most effective and sustainable way
possible that's why i create these
videos
to point people in the right direction
and to ensure that they aren't wasting
their time and effort and money
on things that don't work and breaking
down misinformation like this
is one way of doing that what's going on
guys
and i thought maybe with his full year
away from creating content that there
was a tiny chance
that he was using that time to brush up
on his knowledge
after all the heat that he took last
year after essentially being exposed by
the rest of the youtube fitness
community for
really not having a clue what he's
talking about but that was probably just
wishful thinking on my part
and today i want to do a quick review of
his newest video 10 minute at home
full body workout minimal equipment so
today
we're going to do a follow along workout
that will blast calories help
sculpt lean muscle and it only takes 10
minutes of your day
the truth is you can actually get a
great workout in a short amount of time
but it has to be done
correctly now that's very true it has to
be done correctly
vince does make a great point there but
unfortunately he doesn't actually
follow up on it the big problem with so
many of these at home
circuit style workouts is that a lot of
fitness trainers out there
think that they can just take some
random collection of fancy exercises and
mash them all together in whatever order
and that as long as you're sweating and
your heart rate is elevated
then that's good enough and if the
person demonstrating that workout is in
good shape
and the the video is done with high
quality production value and some
motivating music in the background
then the audience will tend to just go
along with it and assume that it must be
an effective workout that they're going
to get great results from and if you
think vshred having a lot of subscribers
means
that you should follow his workouts then
keep in mind that even this guy had a
large following once too
hi i thought today we're working a
couple of things okay
so we go one two
that's it that's it
that's it
[Music]
that's it and yeah any form of exercise
is obviously better than none and if
someone watches one of the shreds
workouts and it motivates them to get up
off the couch and do something then
that's obviously good
and if you don't take fitness that
seriously and you just want something to
get you moving and sweating a bit then
fine or if you are grandma josephine and
you're just a complete beginner
who just wants to be more active in
general again that's fine
however if your goal is to get in a
truly effective workout and burn some
calories
while creating a good muscle building
stimulus that will actually have some
real hypertrophy benefits
then the workout has to be properly
structured and it has to have some
actual
thought put into it you can't just throw
a bunch of [ __ ] at the wall
and hope that it sticks
oh my god [ __ ] everywhere
he's [ __ ] everywhere now the main issue
with this particular v-shred home
workout
is the use of combination exercises and
i see these being shown all over youtube
and all over instagram
and so i actually wanted to use this
video to demonstrate a larger point okay
this isn't just about v-shred
it's about helping you understand how to
structure a proper workout
and why a lot of these combo exercises
should ultimately be avoided in favor of
something more basic
a combo exercise is basically where
you're lifting a given weight but you're
performing
two or more different movement patterns
in an alternating fashion with that same
weight
now assuming your goal is to actually
maximize muscle stimulation
or at least provide a decent stimulus to
your muscles to all of the muscles that
are involved in that particular exercise
that's actually going to have some real
strength and hypertrophy effect then it
doesn't make sense to randomly combine
different exercises into one since a lot
of the time the amount of weight that
you can handle
on one exercise will differ quite a bit
from what you can handle on a different
exercise
because of the muscles that are involved
and the specific movement patterns that
you're doing
and v-shred of course manages to include
some of the worst possible exercise
combinations
by merging bigger compound movements
with smaller isolation exercises for
example
lateral squats with a tricep kickback in
between
10 reps each side with the tricep kick
back in between
sides
[Music]
so he has you doing a squatting exercise
that involves some of the biggest and
strongest muscle groups on your body
okay your quads and your glutes
and for some reason he combines that
with a triceps kickback which is a very
small isolation exercise
with a terrible resistance curve where
the amount of relative weight that you
can handle is extremely small
in other words if you're using an amount
of weight that allows you to perform
triceps kickbacks in the first place
there's no reason at all why you'd want
to be using that same weight
for a squatting exercise it just means
that by default the weight would be way
too
light to do squats with i mean it just
doesn't make sense
60 of the time it works every time
that doesn't make sense and by the way
if there's any other
fitness experts or specific pieces of
content that you want to see me critique
in a future video
then feel free to comment below and let
me know because i do read all the
comments and i do take your suggestions
into consideration
i mean if you do enjoy these types of
videos then make sure to hit that like
button and let me know
and i will keep on creating them but
anyway after that he's got
lunges combined with biceps curls
[Music]
what the [ __ ] are you doing so same
concept here okay there's just no reason
to ever combine these two exercises into
one
since they are completely different
movements that train completely
different muscles
that are capable of handling very
different weights and the issue is that
because these combo exercises
seem innovative and unique a lot of
beginners will just assume that it's an
effective exercise
and not realize how silly it is to
actually go ahead and do something like
this
goblet squat with a shoulder press
[Music]
you're gonna do this for 10 reps
now this one isn't that bad because he's
at least combining two different
compound exercises together so a
dumbbell front squat
with an overhead press and if the goal
of this workout is more just for
general calorie burning rather than
trying to actually build muscle then i
wouldn't say that this is a terrible
combination okay even a broken clock is
still right
twice a day after all and then after
that he throws in a three-way
shoulder exercise way raise lateral
to front to upright
10 total reps and one rep is all three
[Music]
so first off when you're performing
upright rows you shouldn't be raising
your elbows up
so high like that that's going to put
your shoulders into an awkward
internally rotated position that can
really stress your rotator cuffs over
time
instead if you are going to do upright
rows you should only bring your elbows
up to
shoulder height but no higher than that
secondly front raises are pretty much
just an unnecessary exercise for the
most part
your front delts already get hit very
hard during all of your pressing
exercises for your chest and your
shoulders
and unless they're somehow an obvious
lagging muscle group
which would be very rare then they don't
usually require any extra isolation work
and then thirdly again there's just no
real reason to combine all of these
exercises into one
because upright rows are a compound lift
that allow you to handle a lot more
weight whereas the lateral and front
raises
are isolation exercises where the amount
of weight that you'll be using
will be relatively pretty light so again
this exercise looks cool
but it just doesn't make any actual
sense when you dive deeper into it
then we're going to go with glute
bridges
so 10 reps then we're going to go to
glute kick-ups to a fire hydrant
[Music]
10 reps of each movement on each side
then he's got some body weight glute
exercises thrown in these are basically
grandma josephine types of movements if
you're not adding any extra
resistance for them you know an
unweighted glute bridge that isn't
really going to do much for most people
given that he's only recommending doing
10 reps and then he throws in some
push-ups and planks
those are fine for a bodyweight workout
so no real issue there
so i understand that this is not meant
to be some sort of full-blown
hypertrophy workout okay i get that but
regardless
the exercise selection here still makes
no sense at all and there's zero reason
to combine exercise
in this way especially something like a
squat and a triceps kickback
that's just basic fitness 101 that any
fitness trainer should
understand if you are going to combine
exercises then at least combine
movements that you have similar strength
levels on
like maybe some type of squatting motion
with a hip hinge motion maybe like a
romanian deadlift
or a push-up with a dumbbell row or
maybe a biceps curl
with some type of triceps extension
something along those lines
and even then i still don't see any good
reason to combine exercises in this way
unless of course you are a fitness
youtuber or an instagram influencer
who's trying to impress their beginner
audience with innovative exercises that
aren't actually
better than doing something more basic
it just makes much more sense
to select a given exercise for a certain
muscle group
perform it in a way that challenges that
specific muscle
using appropriate resistance then move
on to the next exercise for the next
muscle
train that muscle properly based on the
resistance it can handle and so on and
so forth
but if you're using a weight that you
can do curls with and you're doing 10
reps of that
while also using it for lunges and then
doing 10 reps of that
then basically you're just getting in a
biceps workout since your quads and
glutes are not going to be challenged by
that weight
and the best part here is that he
actually says that advanced lifters can
use this workout effectively
now for the advanced lifters out there
that don't think that you can benefit
from workouts like this as well
just grab some heavier weights and get
to work i guarantee if i was standing
next to you right now i'd figure out a
way to push you and make you sweat
bullets by the end of this okay i
promise you there's no
truly advanced lifter on the planet who
would benefit from a workout structured
in this way
um again for total novices or for people
who just want to get more active in
general then fine
this workout isn't going to hurt you but
there are just much better ways to go
about it and to get better results for
your time and for your effort and if you
do want to grab a free
properly structured training program
that you can perform at a regular gym
or from home with minimal equipment in
order to gain muscle effectively and
then just combine that plan with some
basic cardio to take care of the
conditioning and the fat loss aspect
