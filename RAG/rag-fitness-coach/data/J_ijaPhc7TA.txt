welcome back to another video in this
contest prep series
in today's video i wanted to discuss a
few things first up i want to discuss my
plans for mock peeking and how to peak
for a bodybuilding show
secondly i wanted to discuss something i
don't see discussed that much
which is body image during prep
and finally i wanted to discuss
why i don't plan competing in
bodybuilding again
for a long time after this show which is
somewhat related to body image during
prep
first my plans for mock peaking
and how to peak for a bodybuilding show
so
generally speaking when peeking for a
bodybuilding show what you're trying to
achieve is
look
leaner and bigger
now
peaking is different for natural versus
enhanced athletes and there's a lot of
cultural
um beliefs
that come with peaking like many things
in bodybuilding there's a lot of um
you know traditions or practices that
have persisted despite not there
not being much evidence for them um
for example for natural athletes
a lot of sodium manipulation or water
manipulation probably doesn't make much
sense
but it still persisted just because
that's part of the culture um
but yeah so i want to discuss how to
peak for a bodybuilding show
there are a few different
types of practices or peaks
there's something called a front load
for example front load sorry which is
when you start peaking for a show or
making nutritional changes
earlier in the week so for example let's
say you're competing on saturday you'd
start making changes on monday
whereas in a quote-unquote backload
you'd start making those changes much
later in the week maybe on thursday or
wednesday even or sometimes even friday
um
there are
advantages and disadvantages to both
for example one advantage of a front
load is that you have a bit more time to
adjust things so let's say you
overshoot how many carbs you have and
you wind up looking pretty spilled over
spilled over as a term people you use to
describe when
you don't have as much definition and
muscle stration and that sort of thing
as you did before starting the peak
um likely because there's been an excess
of
water that's sort of blurring you out a
little bit it's not entirely clear why
but long story short it happens when
your detail and definition decreases a
little bit as a result of a peak going a
bit wrong
and
during a front load for example because
you have four or five days to adjust
things overall
even if you look a bit spilled over
after a couple of days you still have
time to make adjustments to correct sort
of course correct your peak protocol to
then come into the show or the photo
shoot or what have you looking on point
but then one disadvantage of front load
and
in turn an advantage of a backload would
be that you
have less time to actually diet because
obviously if you start making those
changes earlier then you're spending
less time and deficit and so potentially
at least
you would be slightly less lean than you
would be if you did a backload where
you'd be spending maybe an extra two to
four days on a deficit instead
and so each strategy has its benefits
and disadvantages i think
for most people it makes sense to do a
front load um
simply because it's a bit more
safe i guess or fool proof
because you have more time to adjust
things especially for first time
competitors but i think a lot
a lot of peaking science and peaking
effectively comes down to having
practiced it before
so because there's not that much actual
quote-unquote science or evidence on
peaking itself in bodybuilding
you have to
go off of mechanistic explanations so
for example oh you know
taking in more carbs probably increases
uh musk glycogen which then makes your
muscles look bigger
um
so you have to go off with mechanistic
explanations
in tandem with previous experience on
yourself ideally
and so what i'm doing now is i'm peeking
for a few photo shoots
and seeing how i respond taking some
pictures seeing how they respond to
days one and two for example and see how
it um respond to the last few days
so i can then have a better plan going
into my actual show
and so i think
having previous experience or running a
mock peak can be really
really useful for
making sure your peak goes according to
plan when it comes around to actually
competing on stage
so for me i'm doing a front load uh the
first day is a higher court day so i'm
having around
110 percent of maintenance on fifteen
percent
i'm going off the
eric helms peaking protocol
um
where the first day is a bit higher carb
so around 110 percent
of your maintenance with the additional
calories coming from carbs
then the next two following days being a
bit lower than maintenance around
maintenance minus around 500 calories
then
one day
with around maintenance a little bit
below maintenance if you're looking at
spilled over or a bit above maintenance
if you're looking
a bit too dry or small and so forth
and flat i suppose and then on the last
day which is competition day basically
just make adjustments based on how you
look so if in the morning of the
competition or the photo shoot you look
a bit spilled over try and reduce carbs
a little bit don't overdo it maybe have
around
70 of maintenance calories ish whereas
if you look quite flat it might be worth
going up to around maintenance or maybe
even something above maintenance
um
but yeah long story short i'm starting
to peak around five days before
my photoshoot or competition the first
day is a high carb day followed by two
lower carb days
followed by one day where i have
as many carbs as necessary depending on
whether i look flat or full
and then on the competition day itself
i
also adjust based on assessments in the
morning
looking at how i look whether it's
more flat or more full and then go from
there
as far as water and sodium goes
not many manipulations just some extra
sodium
salts
on the day of the competition or the
photoshoot
to make sure blood pressure can check
basically when you're in complex prep
blood pressure can drop quite low for
example my blood pressure has dropped by
10 to 20 points
total
both systolically and blastoically
and so i have
mild
low blood pressure
diastolically
and having low blood pressure can be
wise for getting a pump having a bit
higher blood pressure can be helpful
and so having some salt on that day
might help with
having slightly higher blood pressure
and making sure you can actually get a
pump
so on the competition day on the photo
shoot day i'll have some extra salt
around
an extra 10 grams of salt total or so
um that would be around an extra four or
five grams of sodium
but yeah that's essentially my peaking
strategy and
if you were to do a back load you'd have
more carbs but
on
one to three days instead instead of
four or five days ahead of time
um
but most of the other stuff wouldn't
change much but for most people
initially i recommend the front load
again just because it gives you more
time to adjust things going into a show
or into a photo shoot but if you have
practiced backloading before and or
you've done a mock peak for it um then i
think you can safely go ahead and do a
backload and be just fine
it's also important to note that peaking
does help with how you look
for naturals but it's not going to make
that big of a difference and so the main
thing is just actually being fairly lean
so
you know
take it with a grain of salt pun
intended
next up i wanted to discuss two topics
that go hand in hand so i'll just
mention them together now
first one is my body image doing prep
and how body image during prep can be an
issue and the second one would be why i
don't plan on competing in bodybuilding
again for a long time after the show
at this point
competing and preparing for competition
has had a pretty major impact on my life
um
as much as possible i've tried not to
let it i've tried to focus on other
things uh on you know not getting overly
hungry that sort of thing
but at some point
[ __ ] just to the fan and at this point
in prep
you know you start looking yourself in
the mirror and you're
getting worse and while judging whether
for example you're getting leaner at how
you look and that sort of thing and i
think that's part of the reason why
having a coach during conference prep
can be quite helpful is because as you
get deeper and deeper into cultures prep
you know you start being less and less
objective about judge of your own
appearance
um but even beyond just body image which
tends to get worse as you cut and cut
and cut usually
um
especially when you're competing in
bodybuilding which is a very visual
sport
besides even just body image
my life outside of prep has taken a hit
because of prep
so for example
nowadays it takes me a lot more time to
do my steps so do my daily activity i'm
looking forward to training a lot less i
am
thinking about food a lot more and i
can't be a sociable because of
having fewer calories to play with it's
being hungry and so not wanting to be
eating out all the time because i get
less satiation from eating out
and so overall as far as my social life
goes it's me worse because i'm not able
to eat out as much for example
and because i'm
generally speaking less fun to be around
like that's something a lot of
bodybuilders mention which is
prep can damage relationships a little
bit
because you're just less fun to be
around you're moody you're irritable
it's just not a good time
um so as far as social life goes as far
as my wife life goes as well just having
to do that many steps and training hard
and being less energetic less focused
all that stuff has had a toll on my
work as well
whether that's working for my phd
or doing coaching work so
it's just been a lot and obviously
these are the last six weeks until i
expected there to be an impact
but
unless i really enjoy the experience of
competition itself
i doubt i think
i'll compete anytime soon again just
because the negative impact that complex
prep has had on my lifestyle overall
hasn't really been worth the reward
um
and so i probably will take a few years
after this show
to just build and be more flexible with
fighting be i have more emphasis on you
know getting my training in building
some muscle but not being crazy lean or
not being
very very meticulous with nutrition
just having a more relaxed approach and
allowing myself to take a bit more focus
on other areas of my life which have
suffered during this contest prep
and so i think after this show is over
i'll go back into an offseason for a few
years
and as i said place more of an emphasis
on other areas of my life
just for context this week of training
that you're seeing right now was my last
week before my deload and so that was
one represent on everything and it was
hard it was probably the hardest week of
training i've had in a long time um
and yeah prep has also impacted as i
said my enjoyment in training and that's
a pretty big part of why i lived in the
first place
and so going back to the offseason and
being more relaxed penetration is
definitely gonna be helpful for my
enjoyment of training and fitness
overall
anyways that wraps up this video if you

next one
