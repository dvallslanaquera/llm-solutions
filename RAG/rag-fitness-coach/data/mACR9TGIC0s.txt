you will find at least one and I believe
at most one study actually examining
this one study tells us almost nothing
about the real world just a little bit
of a clue but it found that a lower
angle somewhere between 10 and 30
degrees actually targets the upper chest
the best but I'll give you guys a much
better trick than that play around with
a few different angles and figure out
works best for you
