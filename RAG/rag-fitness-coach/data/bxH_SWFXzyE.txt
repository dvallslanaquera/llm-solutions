real talk I had no idea where the fuck
you were up
seven rats
oh my God Seven divs never felt horrible
life what awesome
[Music]
folks I'm Dr Mike from Amazon's
periodization this is Mr Tristan Lee for
trustingly official
in any case we got this together
I like to trust in him I thought my God
that guy's arms are huge
but
Justin what is the size of an arm that
is big enough
is there is there even I don't think so
which is why we're gonna train arms
we're gonna do it using the RP
hypertrophy app as always and by always
I mean recently since it's uh starting
to starting to hit uh pain is on the
menu but uh we already trained legs and
Tristan possibly never flinched a single
time which tells me he's a cyborg from
the future and this arm workout should
be a breeze but prepare for pumps do you
have a some kind of strangle situation
under there that we're going to be
exposing later uh after after I get a
pump yes and that is the rule of the day
one two three let's go
foreign
overhead Easy Bar extension this is a
great amazing tricep exercise I no
longer do it because I have so much trap
I think that I can't even get into
position anymore which sucks
I used to love this exercise it was
responsible for a huge huge fraction of
my tricep growth the big cues here are
to keep the elbows pointed forward
especially on the way down there's
nothing wrong with putting them out
except it brings a little bit more
shoulder into the equation if you point
them forward it really just ends up
being all triceps so it's a small matter
but a matter that I think can make a
very solid difference
that's a big cue we're going to be going
slow on the way down you've got to go
deep people don't want to go deep on
this exercise because it humbles them
with how little weight they have to use
in the end it's not about how much
weight you use because there's nobody
keeping track of that hey how much
weight are we using how much weight
nobody gives a shit
do proper technique the nice full deep
pause at the bottom stretch and a full
lockout at the top then we're making
money we're gonna do four sets here 10
to 20 reps super high quality that's the
first thing I want to say the second
thing why is my hoodie up because
Toronto Canada is a high crime area I
don't really be seen by the wrong gangs
you feel me
up 15. elbows in slow
go go
16. now it's time to turn it on let's go
elbows in
good pause here no rush
speed
yes go go go go
wrap hell yes
hell yes plus one yeah yeah yeah
technique never broke down a single time
up go you got one more let's go we're
here to go hard elbows in
[Music]
oh my God amazing eleven very good my
rep drop off for arms compared to like
legs or anything else is so much higher
they drop off more Farms I think I know
why or I have a hypothesis at least
you have really really gifted arms and I
think they're probably
stronger relative to the rest of your
body and also bigger and also more
composed probably a faster twitch muscle
fibers and that tends to mean that
because of all of those factors
independently and combined they just
don't recover as fast which is a good
thing if you have muscles that recover
instantly they're probably small and
slow twitch and they suck like anyone
that can just like back to back do the
same number of reps I'm like
you need to get bigger you're either
training like a pussy or you're of a
bunch of clothes yeah you know you'll
get bigger but maybe not as much as you
would ever yeah
seven two more
[Music]
deep
eight one last one elbows in
Deep head down
up
up up
yes
oh my God perfect perfect
oh
that'll fucking do
hey you know when those last drops when
you're like
shaking you can feel your quads tensing
why are my quads cramping on a trip oh
yeah I've had my quads fully cramped on
an overhead press before your body's
terrified to survived yes it was
actually very terrifying
um all right let's uh take it easy for a
sec and then go do dips yeah let's do it
very cool now that you don't have
triceps anymore yeah
foreign
[Music]
yeah let's uh
find your box sure go up higher yeah
that way you can just stretch out world
Strongest Man ready
is that one better is it a small block
oh
yeah
overhead tricep extensions are done four
sets of somewhere around 10 to 15 reps
and we have that logged in to the RBI
hypertrophy app excellent now it's dips
typed in our body weight Kirsten's
weighing around 150 pounds 147 ish
and these dips are done in a special way
we don't want to come forward too much
we want to stay more upright and come
down it's not Ultra comfortable as far
as how much strength you're able to
produce but it is ultra uncomfortable
for the triceps getting stretch under
load which is exactly what we want we
want a measured descent full pause at
the bottom and a full lockout at the top
four sets of dips yikes he can do like
40 dips normally fresh will not be
getting sets of 40 because the triceps
are super super pretty exhaustive which
is perfect let's get into it
six more
deep as you can
up
seven racks
oh my God Seven divs never felt hard of
our life
what awesome that is awesome
that tells me two things one you worked
really hard on the overhead extension
your triceps or shot and two the
technique you're using here is exactly
the kind of technique that leverages the
most into your triceps the least of
everything else and it just makes them a
huge limiting factor
yes
six more
[Music]
up seven one more you got this
deep
go one more again
all the way down up
go
hell yes
Redemption
good stuff man
five
a couple more here deep
six I see that nose touching one more
you got this
up be athletic lock it lock it
yes
hell yes holy shit that was the rep of a
century sir
holy shit it felt like a century fuck
bicep training time but before can I ask
you to fill something out really quick
let's do it just basically how did your
whole tricep situation feel if you just
answer each question just kind of
wondering what you think about this
whole system
definitely post Malone excellent
that's it boom you need like a death
option like I died or if you just don't
fill it in they know he died yes it's
like a 30 second timer the app's like it
just messages 911
[Music]
we want a maximum stretch on the bicep
because stretch under load is a big
thing for hypertrophy so what we're
gonna do
have you step forward you can stagger
step if you want whatever is best
big chest at the bottom you don't want
to be here
this stretches the biceps a lot and then
you Arc through and come up to here you
don't have to come up like this just to
hear okay slow and controlled Big
Stretch at the bottom and a little pause
boom
Big Stretch and a pause
boom make sense that's good
[Music]
one slow
Big Stretch
finish
and as if another
slow chest up
[Music]
rack
phenomenal so guys Maya rep match
whatever number of reps Tristan gets in
his first set we're gonna write that
down into the app
and then all the other sets after if he
falls a little short of it he just takes
a tiny little five second ten second
break and then finishes however many
reps he has to oh shit you got a few
more
four or more
[Music]
go go
slow now don't go anywhere just stay
right there
finish last one up
up
up
and as if another slow big chest big
chest big chest and rat
beautiful beautiful beautiful
Jesus yeah
that works
that fucking works one set left
seven one more one more

one
Ray technique

[Music]
three boss at the bottom go
slow cast up
pause Wrath

two when you're ready
[Music]
yes now slow big chest big chest big
chest pause
rap
fuck yeah
let's go uh kick them while they're down
yeah let's do it
for today with Mr Tristan
this is a standing two-armed dumbbell
curl but it's done very special style we
took the Jared feather Jerry curl we
modified it to be even more extreme so
here it is
and I'm glad you're here for this
we are going to grab the dumbbells
and well actually without dumbbells for
now
typically people curl like this which is
totally fine
what you want to do is pre-stretch the
bicep
which means you're going to the entire
time have your chest up and out you're
actually arching your back and leaning
back
and you take all the dumbbells all the
way back here you come up high enough
that it's a little easier at the top you
pause for just a fraction of a second
and then slowly Centric all the way down
pause slow eccentric just like that
give it a shot a couple times what
happens if my arms fall off
we will get someone to plug them back in
and you'll do a few more reps
go 11 slow
up
go go go go go go go go slow that's 12 a
couple more you got this
[Music]
13 chest up chest up chest up it's not
going to make it easier it's going to
make it harder we want harder
