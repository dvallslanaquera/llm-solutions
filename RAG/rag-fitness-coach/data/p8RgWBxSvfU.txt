warrior shit is sweet you're a fucking
Ronin whatever the hell you have to tell
yourself but that can backfire so what I
would say is treat yourself more on
average like a machine rather than a
samurai warrior first micro cycle a calm
gentle compassionate machine iRobot type
shit you know the next couple mesos
incrementally more machine-like to like
Mech Warrior Gundam Wing type shit and
then maybe the last micro cycle last
week yes unsheath your Samurai sword and
whatever that fucking oh that no no
don't hurricane yourself sword forward
but if you unleash that dumbass in micro
cycle one you're just gonna be so
drained by week three that you won't
have productive training you'll have to
deload
