scott if i'd never do cavs ever again
that'd be fine
this cab machine is especially stupid
calf train's my favorite because i hate
kev oh i hate this machine
time to get to it
pm session uh just rounding out
today's training with some calves uh
then some
side delts probably do a lateral machine
and then
some curls for biceps and that's it
[Music]
during prep when stressful you know
events arise man i just
deal with it in a sense that i already
have my plan laid out
i need to follow it i need to stick with
it to be successful
get that prep i get it done i mean it's
you know it's very generic
you know response i put my head down and
get it done
you know you're stressed out you're
going to be stressed life happens
but do you want to throw all your hard
work
away that you've done up to that point
and you know because stress what you're
gonna miss a workout you're gonna
go off your diet for something that's
important that you said you're gonna do
anyway and plan
for it's mind-boggling to me
why throw away that investment you put
in that time investment
i deem that enough of that shit
[Music]
jerry jerry
you so strong big charlie what's there
some laterals on this pretty good
feeling arsenal machine
um i think jared's going for 20 or more
i'll probably shoot for around there too
[Music]
when i hear people saying oh man this is
hard i want to quit
why am i doing this to be completely
honest what i want to say to them
is okay quit that's fine you're
doing this yourself you don't have to
diet you don't
have to train you don't have to do prep
this is a privilege to do
you chose to do this so if you want to
stop stop
that's fine stop complaining about it do
it or don't get over it
oh gonna refuel
with my sparkling ice coconut pineapple
all natural with vitamins and
antioxidants
calorie free somehow magic
curls for the girls yeah
[Music]
some biceps uh
jared will be doing some rope curls over
there
i'm going to be doing some easy bar
curls uh
we're doing different movements why do
you ask
because i have some local we're
different fucking people
that yeah i hate him i don't want to do
what he's doing screw you
or it's because my elbows are in a bit
and these don't bother
at the moment so that's why i'm doing
[Music]
them
[Music]
[Music]
so if someone says they're tired they're
burnt out they won't quit they want to
give up
man you know you kind of came all this
way
put all this energy in it's a finite
time you're doing this this doesn't last
forever think of it that way
push a little harder push a little more
put your head down stick to the plan
at the end of the day when you're done
this prep or whatever
kind of you know finite child time
constraint challenge you have
you're going to look back and say i'm
glad i stuck with it
i'm glad i didn't give up i'm glad i
tried my hardest
i'm glad i stuck to the plan yes better
yeah remember instead of being back here
like this you want to make sure to put
the weight
here
yeah perfect
perfect there you go yep same thing as
your back double and your back latch but
start from the ground
so make sure you twist your hips fill
your hamstrings tighten
quarter turn there you go
there it is yep quads
so there you go here's that time that's
better
um i think you can just hit it with the
leg out
it looks way like just super good on you
yeah it looks way better front double
bicep
beautiful beautiful perfect so like all
of his mandatory poses
are uh super impressive because of his
shape obviously
michael and mikowski worked with him and
beefed it up a ton
and then there were some things we
wanted to change with a supposing
routine and a few
cues that i like to give to people to
help them uh
maintain composure on stage basically so
the way he poses if he tenses everything
too much you get really really tired so
small cues that i'm giving him are gonna
help him to hit his poses longer
so that way he's not the guy out there
who's shaking and losing all of the
so like i keep saying like quads just
body weight forward shift the hips open
that way you're not standing on your
heels and trying to flex your quads
really hard
because it fucks everything up then
you're just like tired by the time you
get all the other poses
so by the time he hits that front relax
move to the center because he's going to
look fucking amazing
and then it's just about holding all the
poses uh workout
was uh fine i've been fine
uh i felt a little tired um
but uh that's to be expected
uh but feel overall pretty good this is
straight up the most forced interview
i've ever seen in my life
folks let me break it down to you on the
reel you want to know how charlie feels
right because your
journey along your own heart his thing
he doesn't feel that much
it just doesn't have the capacity to
feel it's like what does a dog think
about like you know the fucking platonic
scriptures
fucking doesn't right charlie has two
emotions han
and what do you feel like right now
that's it
