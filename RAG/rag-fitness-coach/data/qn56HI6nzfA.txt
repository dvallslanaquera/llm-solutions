my goodness is it good to be back
thanks for coming with us dr james dr
mike it's the weekly webinar we're here
to answer your youtube questions
mike i gotta tell you one of my dogs
took a shit about
one foot to the right of where i'm
sitting right now and the smell has not
gone away it smells like ass right here
those goddamn dogs
i know like i brought them home from the
vet and immediately they ran into the
office and took a huge shit
like a banana-sized shit in it or just
one of them
just i think the one hammer fest
that's the girl right
she takes like sister some of the
biggest continuous dog logs
yeah exactly sister and uh she her
fucking logs man are like human-sized
logs i'm like how does a
poo a continuous poo come out of this
little dog
they eat a lot yeah little fucking
hungry hippos little chongolina
yeah all right
well shall we get to it
yeah i'm ready i'm gonna i have some i'm
starving to death so
forgive me in advance i'm gonna have
some chili but i will mute myself so you
don't have to listen to me slop through
like a piggy
all right
so thiraniful
starts us off for pull-ups my set to set
performance decrease
is way higher than for other exercises
if i do something like four sets of two
ir it tends to go something like eight
six four two
why is this and is there something i can
do about it
could be for a bunch of reasons one of
the reasons it could be some of the
muscles involved
some of the limiting muscles are a
really fast twitch it could be that
they're not very well vasculized
could be a bunch of other stuff easiest
resolution to this
is twofold so
one is not a resolution at all but it's
a don't worry about it
if your reps are over five then they're
about as hypertrophic
set percent as anything else but
there you are into the problem of 8642
you know the four and especially the two
g was yes it's not that many reps so the
easiest resolution for that
is to rest longer because you know you
might be
just an extreme example but maybe you're
used to doing bicep curls
and then you've never done squats before
you usually rest a minute between
exercises
and then you do a set of squats for the
first time ever you rest a minute you
get one tenth of the reps and then the
next set you don't get any reps
so there's no reason to assume that the
rest time is going to be the same for
all the exercises
if you go according to our rest time
four factor model which we
have all over youtube just type in rest
times as we're telling it'll come up
how long should i rest between sets
it'll come up if you're following that
and you're dipping under five reps
you're technically violating one of them
so what you want to do is rest longer so
instead of resting maybe a minute 30
seconds maybe like you do now
try to rest for two minutes or even
three minutes between sets of pull-ups
and it will almost always have much
higher ups and problem solved
james yeah definitely i think the rest
times is the first
and foremost issue like dr mike said
they're um
what i would do so i'm kind of looking
at what you said about like the 8642
once you get to like six or five then
what i would consider doing is moving
into either assisted pull-ups and or
pull-downs
um and one thing sorry that you'll find
is that um sometimes you might hit a
limit like this with your pulling
movements and this is something i've
experienced
where you're just like you're struggling
to get above five reps even if you're
doing assisted
and at that point your lats might not
actually be toasted yet it might be a
combination of things like like for me
like anthropomorph
anthropomorphic my anthropometry is not
great for pull-ups let's put it that way
um and so then you might switch over to
something like some type of lat
isolation exercise like a straight arm
pull or a cable you know straight arm
pull or something like that
to get whatever lat volume you still
need because it might just be one of
those things where
if you're built like me or you know
really lanky that you just suck at that
particular movement and you're probably
not going to do much better
um so consider moving into the assisted
after you get below
you know five or six reps and then if
you're still kind of hitting a wall
there i would
move into like an isolation type
movement for the lats and then maybe hit
a couple sets of that move on
yeah at some point even expanding the
rest times might just be like well
you're just not strong enough to do that
many sets of pull-ups without the reps
falling off
that's that yeah totally
all right next up is montas billy
buchas oh
montes always with the good questions
matas always gets uploaded like crazy
he's a man um he says
and this he's just down there below he's
got recognizable name now too
um he says
when massing mainly for strength working
with three to five reps how much lower
should the
calorie surplus be compared to gaining
weight with maximum hypertrophy mind
well i think the answer there is you
shouldn't
number one answer is you should be
gaining weight
only with maximum hypertrophy in mind um
because then you
maximize how much hypertrophy you're
getting and
if you don't have a whole lot of muscle
to build
then you just don't do hypertrophy
training for as long
and then you switch to an iso caloric
environment once you're at the weight
you want to be at
and productively lift in an isocaloric
environment
or eucalypt environment whatever where
you're just a maintenance
uh so when you're gaining when you're
massing for strength
it's called a hypertrophy phase in
strength periodization and it's sets of
roughly five to ten
and then you do the same surplus you
would usually do the same surplus range
uh maybe a little bit lower than for
hypertrophy range it's not optimizing
operation it's just optimizing it for
strength so maybe
on the low end of the hypertrophy
gaining range but
i would not recommend gaining mass
mostly working with sets of three to
five
because that doesn't optimize mass
gaining
and it doesn't you know it's just uh
what the hell is yelling back there
james
mel and the dogs okay can you tell me
like
sorry really loud shut up shut up
you might have changed my microphone
settings
that's that's that's drawing the line
that's drawing the line
for me you don't touch the microphone
yeah
i'll do that later but yes so in any
case yeah you just you want to do when
you're massing you train for hypertrophy
which is if for strength purposes that's
roughly five to ten massive at the low
end of the normal range so if you're if
you're
massing and training with sets of three
to five it's highly suboptimal we have
to tell you that
if you're gonna do it then you gain
considerably more slowly
um it might be the case that working
with sets of three to five
uh with the optimum volume for strength
might be
at your mev for hypertrophy or maybe
even below
in which case you might not gain a whole
lot of muscle if you're advanced
is training with such a three to five no
matter what your rate of gains is
also you'll notice the following that if
we say that
the lower your reps scheme is and the
fewer sets you have and if you're strong
you do fewer sets
then the lower your rate of gains
there's a hypothetical point at which
your rate of gains is so tiny
that why are you massing in a strength
phase you could be having a greater
gains if you just mastered the right
repetition range
so just do one and the other that's the
best answer i think james
yeah i totally agree with mike here and
you know mike did a very eloquent way of
saying like both of those are kind of
bad ideas right
and for reasons that mike already
mentioned but so here's kind of the deal
you know for strength athletes
whether you you know you fancy yourself
that or not but if you're a strength
power sport
once you hit five reps and lower you
should mainly be in an iso caloric state
for a variety of reasons one as mike
said it's probably not the best way to
do massing
period regardless of what your endeavors
are
but two you're going to actually start
to run into problems if you're making
significant body composition changes
when you're training for
what is roughly maximal strength because
your body position your kinematics your
technique will start adjusting as your
body mass also and this goes in both
directions you shouldn't be trying to
lose weight you shouldn't be trying to
gain weight because you're going to
start to see
significant changes in your body
composition which is going to alter your
technique
and you don't want any technique changes
when you're training for maximal
strength you want that to be lock step
ready to go and it's just a matter of
training and having high levels of
preparedness not
dealing with incremental changes in your
body calm so there are times and i've
said this before where
you might have somebody who um your
periodization plan worked out
that they did a cut and maybe they
actually undershot
their competition or their ideal body
weight for whatever it is that they had
coming up a little bit
and so you might do something like you
know i've loosely called gaintaining
which is like
planning on being iso caloric but
loosely and if they gain a little bit of
weight along the way so long as it
didn't take them out of their optimal
range
that's fine might help take the edge off
a little bit but for the most part it
would be like a planned
maintenance phase uh in terms of diet
and if they had some you know if they
were underweight by a lot
then they could have some extra snacks
here there but it wouldn't be like okay
here's the planned rate of gain it's
just here's we're planning on iso
caloric
and if you want to have you know like a
donut or something every now and again
it's not a big deal
that's kind of how i would approach it
next up a little bit of a scroll is
muhammad
says oh interesting one
um i think you're not scrolled to the
there you go boom okay i think so
so it was just delayed you're good james
this might be a controversial question
but i would like to hear your thoughts
on the matter do you guys think that
there should be a separate olympics that
doesn't do any drug testing
not that they encourage it but it's not
against the rules the idea is to see how
far
uh can advance medicine help with sport
performance same idea with ufc while
they don't do any testing
we already know that people passing drug
tests and cheating on their sport so why
not just put them against people who are
willing to take what they take
and to make more of a level playing
field of course amateurs and people
under a certain age eg24
have to compete in the tested category
until they can make the decision to
switch regarding the health risk i think
doctors can more carefully monitor
athlete's health
intervene more quickly if it stopped
being such a taboo topic
also if this was to apply uh by what
margin do you think records are going to
be broken
uh thank you for the informative content
uh great question
so my answer is actually very simple yes
uh it's not
i suppose it could be some somewhat of a
cop-out but i can uh caveat it
adequately i think i speak for james and
i both who say that we're fundamentally
like
pro-liberty people call it cause classic
liberals or libertarians or
anarcho-minimalists or whatever and we
think that if someone is an adult and
can sign a contract and they're not
hurting uh uncontracted parties they
should be allowed to do essentially
whatever the hell they want
so if james hoffman opens up the steroid
federation
of just do as many drugs until you die
and there's not even a sport you just
shoot drugs
um then if people sign up and people
want to watch and buy tickets
and see you know get online pay-per-view
passes then
i think that's totally fine and i think
it was about as far as morality should
go
uh at that point you're not cheating at
sport because everyone's doing the same
modalities
um and i think they would have if if
that sort of thing was popular
you'd have a real cleansing effect on
actual tested competition
so i'll tell you this um because there's
drug tested
bodybuilding and untested bodybuilding
the drug tested bodybuilding
sees relatively low use of steroids
because the guys that want to use and go
all out they just go in the regular
version and because the regular version
with the one with the drugs untested i
do the mpc is that what makes you more
money anyway and it gives you more
notoriety
very few people cheat at natural
bodybuilding because they're cheating
for what so you can call yourself wni
bfa pro and nobody can give a flag fuck
like
natural bodybuilding is cool as shit but
it's not exactly filling the seats
so but it is a much purer sport than for
example what you would call natural
bodybuilding in the 80s or something
when
everybody was juicing and they tried to
drug justice sport in the early 90s it
failed terribly
because you know juxtaposed this was
something like track and field and look
at track and field
there's only a tested version at the
olympic level an international track and
field
and the use rates are unbelievable
almost everyone at the top is using
because
the incentives are insane and there's no
alternative
so if you want to see drug tested sport
one of the best ways to do that
is to have an option for people who
don't want to be tested and the
marketplace should decide whether or not
that is a good idea this is not you know
would i like to see it yeah i don't know
sure or not i don't give
a shit cool i'm not really interested in
human performance
esoterically like that i think sport is
entertaining um i'm interested in a
personal level i want to get jacked up
and help you guys get jacked
i don't it's cool to see like the
ultimate person get jacked and that's
fine i don't think it's like a
like a moral social mission of like we
should as a society see how far humans
are capable of doing
i don't give as humans are nothing
machines are capable of more than
uh than us and we'll be sued at
everything let's push the machines
sports or entertainment literally this
is jokes sports are a joke it's a hobby
and it's fun and it's great and it's
entertaining but it's entertainment it's
like saying
to me saying you can't have a drug using
sport federation is like telling
strippers they can't have like implants
it's like the whole thing's for
entertainment
like why not so so to me that there's an
obvious
yes uh james anything you want to throw
in there can you imagine if you just
radically disagreed with me you're like
absolutely not
yeah no no so like mike said we we
largely share the same opinion and i'm
going to come at it maybe from two
slightly different angles but so i agree
with everything that dr mike said first
of all first and foremost
like i have no issues with people who
want to use drugs outside of the
legalities and that's an ethics issue
not a moral issue
um here's the other thing right it
sounds great and everybody thinks about
like oh well if you had guys who were
juiced up it'd be great to watch them
uh compete but the problem is it doesn't
end there right so there's a liability
issue where you're gonna have guys who
are pcp'd and meth out
who step into a cage and effectively
can't die for the next five minutes
and then they die afterwards right or
they kill the other guy in the ring
because they don't have enough
self-control
so you can say like oh they sign a
waiver but those waivers
only go so far when you have people who
are literally dying
in your sport or whatever competition
that you're hosting so from a
promotional standpoint
that is a very difficult thing to pull
off so people only think about anabolic
steroids but that's
the testing includes all sorts of stuff
right so the last thing i want to see
is you know juice head versus juice head
plus pcp plus meth that like that
doesn't interest me at all that's just
like a disaster
waiting to happen right i don't mind
that if you have two guys who are using
performance enhancing drugs
right but again the testing doesn't just
end there that's not that's not
necessarily
the only reason why that is in place so
there's that definitely some liability
issues for the people participating as
well as the
people promoting whatever events they
are and then as mike kind of said
in one of the comments there's a market
issue where it's like are you really
going to try and split up
your viewing or you know subscribing
audience now into potentially
haves it doesn't seem to make sense from
a promotional
standpoint where yeah you might get some
people who want to see like the most
juiced out people competing ever
but that's also going to be a detractor
for the for the next the nazi crowd
who's
i don't know i would argue roughly
there's there's probably like 50 percent
of people are just kind of want to watch
whatever sport is going on
and then maybe the 25 on the tails would
like to see
only natural versus like supernatural so
it's kind of like
why would you want to diminish your
audience
from getting them getting the biggest
audience that you could so i think
there's a promotional limitation there
and something like the ufc where it's
like yeah we all like mma we all want to
watch that but now it's like okay well
there's ufc one and ufc two
why would you do that when you know just
having one ufc event might be pulling in
millions of pay-per-view buys and
everyone's happy so just
there's some serious limitations there
so i i understand the question and i
think it's a good question
i think the practical limitations are
overwhelming and that's the problem
yeah so it comes down to this like with
james and i think it should be
completely legal in the market
now to the extent that corporations are
willing to step up to the plate and
actually supply that demand and to the
extent that that demand exists
you know we can have wishes to see it
hypothetically that's very different
than demand you know like i would i
would be interested in seeing a
milkshake that's like
three gallons but like if mcdonald's put
that out like how many people really buy
that you know like maybe it's just not
worth
re-machining the factories for that so
uh
yeah but uh i think that's a decent
answer if anyone is a follow-up they can
ask us on
the next webinar um all right on a
hilarious ten
uh not tangent segway our next question
asker is just down
a little bit it's fake natty
oh fake nerdy
we told him last time to have a well i'm
assuming it's a he we told
that person last time to have a better
question because their name was so good
yeah youtube people will be assumed he's
on demographics alone until proven
otherwise
all right so fake natick says
hi docs i have a question regarding two
approaches to back offsets
lowering of no reps uh
at the same weight i think you
okay lowering reps at the same weight
versus lowering the weight and keeping
the reps the same or even increasing
them
what is the difference in the effects
they produce the former is standard in
dr israel's training
uh while the latter among powerlifters
following rts style
programming that nashville inclines me
to think that reps drop
more more suited hypertrophy training
while low drop is more suited to max
strength that's actually backwards we'll
get to that
it's the opposite however there are so
many other factors that may influence
why one is used over the other intensity
of
uh uh no reps slash sets
being probably the main one after doing
your staple
set of one rep oh
a staple set of like one set at rp8
you obviously can't really drop reps in
the next set oh i see oh
one rep at rp8 have can't draw props for
sure yes this is the same question i
asked last week
but you skipped it despite acknowledging
my awesomeness of nickname
well there you go so this time you got a
ton of up votes
congratulations wait so like with the
nick with the name
fake natty does does that mean that he
is admitting to be a
performance-enhancing
uh user i i think
he's just a youtube guy says throw
himself under the bus
he's my name is clear he's a real person
or lift weights
um i think like i know but yeah fake
natty sounds like drug user to me
like does but it's all a meme bro it's
all 8-chan or whatever so
jk lo it's all it's all i still think
it's falls
all the way down it's a great name daddy
here's your answer there's a
good constraint you brought up and here
it is
when you are modulating
the amount of stimulus you're getting
sometimes when you're doing very low
repetition sets
lowering the weight and getting the same
number of sets means you're lowering the
weight by very little
it's still in the strength range so it's
still effective
and you need the volume and the practice
of doing those number of repetitions
so you're doing sets of five
you might still want to do sets of five
even though you're too tired to do your
top sets
so dropping the weight by a little bit
can still let you do sets of five
okay that's a perfectly fine reason to
drop the load and not
the reps because dropping the reps would
you get your sets of four
and three and then it's fine but it's
kind of it gets a little arbitrary
and so on and so forth maybe it doesn't
give you enough technical practice
and so forth however
uh here are the real constraints uh how
to decide which one to drop
it is fine to drop ruts as long as they
don't leave your rep range
and in hypertrophy training anything
north of five generally is fine
so dropping letting reps drop is fine
dropping weight is okay but
what we like to do at rp is kind of an
algorithmic approach to training where
you have
one rule set that makes sense and it
results in the simplest possible
modifications
so our rule is drop load only when you
exit rep range
the thing is a lot of people are like
all right i want sets of 10 only 10.
like okay well to get every single thing
at 10 you'll have to drop the load
more or less every single set if you're
large or strong
but like by how much it's a guessing
game every single set because you're
like oh man that 10 wasn't hard enough
then it was an 11.
so then the reps are random anyway so
what the fuck are you doing it just for
anyone who that went over your head that
mike's talking about if you're holding
an rp
an rir constant you would have to change
virtually every set
yeah so fundamentally
it's kind of like okay you're not really
sure what's going on here
so it's easier to just let the reps drop
until and unless they exit your range
and then you robustly bump up the load
or bump down the load
to get well back into your rep range for
the rest of your sets and again let that
repetitions get degraded over time
that's a way to do it not that way
and it works really well if you want to
modulate load every single time you
totally can
but then you have to watch out for
another thing
when you are doing less than five reps
per set
okay then you know for sure it's not
enough load
uh sorry it's uh you know for sure it's
not hypertrophic enough okay
but if you do enough drop sets if you're
really getting to draw our downsides
rather sorry
if you get another enough downsides
you're always cutting load
you can arbitrarily still be doing what
look like hypertrophic
sets and reps but the load can be so low
you're way outside of the 1rm zone that
is a good idea to do
you should have just left the gym so we
do
an rp a lot of times is we drop the load
only a little bit ever and then when the
reps really decay
we just know we're done because probably
we're putting out such
low efforts that it's junk volume but
you could do a lot of junk volume and
have no idea you're doing it if you just
drop the load all the time
you're like yeah i was doing tris
extensions 120 pounds for sets of 10.
now i'm doing sets of 10 with 60 and
it's like what percent of you want to
ram is that
25 right like who knows and then you may
very well be out of the range but you're
like well i'm still doing sets of ten
like yeah but with a way lighter load
if you do like one drop and then it goes
to sets of five
you're for sure anything lower than that
it's just not going to be stimulative
and you're never going to risk the
chance
of training too light so people ask the
question like okay i'm on my sixth
exercise and it's biceps
should i do a down set no because what
the fuck percent of your 1rm is that
it's going to be so tiny that you're
just moving around
all of your faster twitch fibers are
just off because they're that fatigued
they're barely doing anything and you're
not gaining any muscle um
so real quick that being said can you do
the low drops you absolutely can and for
strength
what i like to think is this if you give
me a choice pure like not no other
conditions no caveats
if i'm training for strength and you
give me the choice of within sets of
three to six
as i fatigue should i let the reps fall
or should i let the load fall my answer
is going to be reps
why because the primary driver of
strength is load
and if you do a couple of sets of four
and then a couple of sets of three
at 200 pounds you get a lot of stimulus
at 200 pounds or makes you really strong
if you get lots of sets of four and then
more sets of four at 200 and then 180
pounds
you did a lot of sets of four which is
good and they have its own mirrors
but some of them were at 180 which
doesn't make you as strong as 200 does
so because we want to maximize the load
factor i would say drop the reps all the
way to the lowest end of the range
before you consider uh dropping the load
there are other ways to do it that are
fine
but i would like to see that question
answered by folks who promulgate those
yeah that was a really good answer just
a couple other things that are worth
maybe thinking about and they're more
practical limitations
is when you start having to add a lot of
down sets
you have to start wondering kind of how
much of this particular exercise do i
really have left in this session
am i starting to go over that kind of
four to five very rough
but still useful limit on this
particular movement or is it time that
maybe i switch to another
good sfr choice movement for this muscle
group because for whatever reason i'm
just tanking
so bad my reps are going down that which
could be a good thing it could mean that
you like it really fucked you up and
each subsequent set you're just you're
really fatigued from the first maybe one
or two sets and that's
not necessarily a bad thing but at the
same time you don't want to be sitting
there doing
10 sets of squats necessarily it might
be good to move on to something else
like the leg press and the extension
pick your poison whatever it is same
thing goes for any other
muscle group and with the strength stuff
you i think
i think more more than the bodybuilding
the strength uh
training stuff you can get into that
junk volume zone really really easy
where
you're used to doing hypertrophy
training so you're like oh i should be
doing like 10 sets of chest right
but really maybe you only needed to do
four sets of bench
and that's it for the day to get that
really good strength stimulus
so it's an easy trap to fall into where
i don't really feel like i did that much
i only did four sets i'm used to doing
like 10 sets per session
maybe i'll add some downsides well those
downsides aren't really doing anything
that those first sets didn't already do
so it's really just adding a lot of
volume and therefore fatigue and not
giving you any
payout so i think that's an easier trap
to fall into where at least in
hypertrophy
you can always add sets and as long as
within your boundaries of recovery
ability
you know you're probably gonna get more
out of it um but those just some other
things to think about
all right ein
brown
let's see
all right broke king of the north that's
a good name
good mood where the fuck's iron brown
down there a little bit was it above or
down there a little bit all right i
think yours were some of them iron makes
me think of the dog from
bebop it should just see i had that dumb
extension
okay which doesn't work uh i should be
up higher if the extension is working
because it's got 13
votes is it uh ein is that
yeah oh i can't control f1 i'm screen
sharing
hold on i'm on sharing
[Music]
now all i'm getting is protein oh there
we go found it all right i'm brown
not to be confused with iron rand wow
oh mike sorry real quick did you see the
trailer for the new batman movie
yes i have mixed feelings about it how
do you feel about it
mixed yeah because there's only some
ways
they always do the origin story right
like let's just have some cool batman
movies at this point why do we have to
continue
where batman came from and also they
always try to make it so grandiose and
sometimes that's great and sometimes
just like yeah
yeah anyway i mean i'll i'll see you
because i'm a chump and i love batman
but
yeah i'm brown
says help me with that all-important
adonis belt question
is it bro-sized that the transverse
abdominis enhances the appearance of an
adonis belt and the following question
if it does how would you preferentially
train it anyway
stomach vacuums don't get harder and
more generally i'm unsure how to
progressively overload transverse
abdominis because in my eyes at least
the transverse abdominis doesn't control
a joint in the traditional sense
so a couple easy answers here uh first
of all i'm not
really sure if the transverse abdominis
contributes to the adonis belt or the
apollo belt what the fuck you call it
basically i call it the fuck muscle
which is like you know the guy with the
big
like muscle love handles in the front
like little v thing and you're like oh
my god i wish he could fuck me you know
like come on we've all felt that before
anyway but he's usually like an italian
or euro like model guy and he looks at
you only with the following facial
expression
and you're like i don't know you know is
he looking at me and he's like do you
have a cigarette and you're like damn it
he just wants cigarettes that's all he
has want cigarettes that's all he wants
yeah brad pitt in fight club probably
had the goddess thing going on
so in any case um
the easiest way to get that jacked is
twofold one
train your abs because your rectus
abdominus literally composed that
fucking
part of the muscle anyway so transverse
abdominis
couldn't contribute but it's deep to
that so it's you may never see it though
it might make it pop out more
and uh and if you want to learn how to
train the transverse abdominis muscles
it's easy
uh proper bracing under fucking heavy
deadlifts and squats
and rows and all this other stuff that's
it like if you can do a yoke walk with a
thousand pounds you got
big ass transverse abdominis muscle
because you're just it's like a belt
literally on you
all the time so that's it
yeah i have no clue but what i can say
is
i don't think that that pursuit is a
good use of your time
just get leaner yeah just get
like mike said it if you want to work on
your your you know abdominal muscles
that's
an easy easy one quick payout um
get better at posing and just get leaner
and more jacked over time
no one's at i don't think anyone's ever
lost a bodybuilding competition because
they didn't train their transverse
abdominis enough
outside of just not training enough
period
right so yeah
all right charles austin
he's got five upvotes so i don't know
where he is with you there james
oh geez oh
jeez where are you charles
oh i found it dude you know what you got
to just turn off that extension so then
we're on the same page and we could
easily find it because i'll tell you
where it's strong
okay that sounds good i'll do that for
next time cool
charles austin says what is your guy's
go-to method of balancing out muscle
asymmetries i've tried more unilateral
movements for my triceps just don't get
a good mind muscle connection on my
right side
i find my left arm will have a good pump
and be sore in a good way after triceps
workout but not my right
so i actually um just recorded a video
on the exact question that will be going
on rp
youtube sometime the thing is we're
recording videos like
crazy so we're like half a year ahead
of schedule which is sweet so enjoy the
many many videos that will come out
every week
for forever but uh there is
uh bringing up lagging muscle groups um
or body parts video already on rp that
you can look and
some of that in there fundamentally it's
the it's an easy answer
you you take your bilateral training
like all the
both arm training you do and you go to
probably maintenance volume and i know
that sucks but you're trying to get one
arm to catch up so the other one has to
be at maintenance
and the only tricep training you do
actually do you only do for your weaker
arm
and you do only unilateral work yeah
it's not going to feel that great
because unilateral work fucking sucks
which is why we do almost none of it
uh you know any kind of pump you're
getting with a cable push down is going
to be a
ball sack of a pump or rather the pump
you're going to get is
is going to be much more terrible if
it's like one arm cable whatever it's
unstable it's bullshit
but that's what you got to do so you got
to get creative and train that one arms
stuff more
while putting everything on the other
tricep arm and maintenance volume so
bilateral movements of maintenance
volume
go from mev to mrv intelligently
logically with tracking on the other
tricep and
when that other tricep gets bigger not
the same size
bigger than the usually big one then you
slowly start to reintegrate normal
training back in
and don't do any extra work for that
weak tricep
then because you got a little bit ahead
of schedule and because the tricep that
was on mv is now
really sensitized for growth and
probably genetically just more prone to
growth which is why it's always getting
bigger anyway
for whatever leverage reasons or fiber
type reasons or neurological reasons
then it'll catch up at least a little
bit and then you'll have a period of
several months or years where they're
roughly the same size
and then this is all going to be in the
video that other dominant tricep just
for normal training is probably just
going to leave your other tricep behind
eventually anyway
so you might want to do another one of
these three mesocycle sort of
prioritization phases at some point
again
you might have to keep doing this every
now and again to make sure they stay
roughly
james yeah that was really good um i
am kind of curious about like not
getting any pump or soreness in
my muzzle connection because that
definitely seems like if if you're not
being a total knucklehead which i'm
if you're watching this video i'm
assuming you're definitely not a
knucklehead because mostly most of you
guys who watch us
are you know trained pretty
intelligently um so my point here is it
seems odd and that might seem like more
of a neurological thing so i'd be
curious to know if you had any like
previous
injuries on that side of your arm like
your shoulder maybe your neck or
something like that
definitely sounds a little bit funky um
the other thing that i just wanna and
i i always pitch this and i always sound
like a dickhead
it's cause i am a dickhead but you might
be overthinking the problem right if
your
triceps are literally not any different
in size
and for the most part not really
significantly different in strength and
when i say significantly there's always
a bilateral asymmetry everybody's a
little bit stronger on one side than the
other for any given muscle group
that's normal that's fine we're talking
as long as it's kind of within like
that normal expected range you probably
don't have a huge
problem now you might be you might not
have an injury and you might just not
get a good pump on your ear soreness on
that one arm and it's just a weird
thing that you know we just can't quite
figure out yet but
if you're getting a decent growth
stimulus you're getting decent
performances
on that same arm don't overthink it
because you might just be able to keep
carrying on with what you've been doing
doing mostly bilateral training
and you just maybe don't get a pump on
that side but you're still making
progress right and so then you might
spend
do uh you know two blocks doing this
prioritization phase when
you could have just been getting more
jacked on both sides instead of just the
one side
so just think about it i'm not saying
that you're wrong
you know i did kind of raise my people's
eyebrow a little bit i'm not saying
you're wrong
but just think like you might be over
over analyzing the asymmetry so i'm
saying yeah
in the in the video to come that we have
asymmetries on our pe
it's a nice long little prelude of like
make sure it's worth it and make sure
you're doing it at the right time
all right uh omkar raane
umkar oh there's some really good names
on this one
anurag vadi u-dub way
wait what sorry i lost track of who are
we looking for
ah all right so it looks like i got to
go back up where are you i'm car
up folks oh got it
all right all right so james i will
begin to answer this
and then you while i answer can you read
it and then give your own answer after
some good
okay the this is the critique my program
one yes can you please critique my
program i've come up with an upper lower
split four days a week and would love to
have your input on it this is how it
looks
i'm not going to read it out loud folks
if you are listening to us podcast style
then you should look at your screen
because it's a lot of shit
but feel free to pause it here if you're
in here for the learning
and you're interested in how we answer
this question pause it read it and then
see if we say
so it looks like he has an upper a
and a lower a uh rest upper b uh rest
lower b
so so for now that split sounds really
good based on uh the session split and
muscle group focus
looks like he has a chest focus upper
and a back focused upper which is really
good he's doing chest movements first
back movements later and then uh
back movements first chest movements
later and some some tricep stuff and
some belts
uh that looks really good so the uppers
look really good for the lower
he's using some bicep curls as well as
training
his legs and that's really good because
biceps could be trade often which means
when you train them sort of
by moving the back uh then it also
knocks that out
um and it looks like he's
really um checking a lot of boxes here
and i would say unless i got real
pedantic and that's james's job he
probably has something
i would say this looks like a pretty
good program the only really tiny
critique i would have so that you could
get something to take away from it
is you have an incline barbell press
here at upper b
that is three sets of six to eight reps
but that's after tons of back work uh
and i would say that that's a little
heavy of a load to be using
you might not have the neural drive to
really get a ton out of that
to use the absolute loads you want for
that
when it's that late in the game fourth
exercise
maybe you just want to do some higher
reps that day
so what i would actually recommend is
lowering your reps
when you're on chest focus for chest and
then raising your reps
in maybe the to the higher slightly
higher rep ranges when you're on upper b
and it's back
focus and this opposite with back so
the back focus stuff when you're uh
doing it at first
have it heavier in the 5 to 10 10 to 15
rep range
and then more like the 15 to 20 rep
range for the stuff you do in upper
a for back when it's later on um
otherwise it looks pretty damn good
james
yeah i think it looks good as well i i
was kind of thinking the same thing that
dr mike had right there
on the incline press maybe go lighter on
that i have a couple silly ones
okay mike i think i think mike you'll
relate to this
even though it's kind of silly bear with
me um
if you've never tried to do like barbell
curls or any kind of really heavy
barbell movement
for biceps after calves it can actually
be
very distracting if your calves are
actually fatigued
uh doing barbell curls can be
unnecessarily awkward
so you might not have that problem i
have that
problem so if my calves are fatigued i
find
myself just having a hard time being
stable on barbell curls
maybe consider flip-flopping those
that's an individualization issue not
like a fundamental issue
um the other only other thing i think it
looks great the only other thing is if
you are
and don't take this to be an insult it's
not meant to be i just assume that
everybody is intermediate unless they
tell me otherwise um i would say you
might be a little bit
heavy on the number of exercises per
muscle yeah in each session
if you are an advanced athlete if you're
like you know what we would call
training age advanced then this is fine
this is like more of an advanced style
in terms of exercise selection
intermediate i would maybe just cut it
down to two but the way that you did it
is fine
but then if it was advanced we wouldn't
recommend you do six or seven movements
per session we would recommend
three to five and then you would have to
have five to six sessions a week
if you could do this number of exercises
and it's gucci great if you could try to
condense the exercise number
that might be a thing might be better
some people are also really good at
isolating their triceps on on dips
i am not so for me if dips are in the
equation it's going to be
up higher up because it's going to be a
chest movement um but if you're somebody
who can do
dips and it's all tricep then i then
that's fine you can put it at the bottom
if not consider moving it
but that looks great yeah next up
elijah clifford
eight up votes i don't know where the
fuck your thing is
but he's got three replies to it as well
i know it was
going so good until just now fuck
all right you know what i'm gonna stop
screen share control f elijah
e-l-i-j-a-h got it
jason blaha all right said
people above 40 should focus on building
strength instead of hypertrophy due to
health and longevity
does he have a point for people who are
not professional bodybuilders
he may very well have a point but to me
that point is now is not immediately
apparent
i actually think it's the other way
around when you're older
you need something that's better for
your metabolic function and that is
building
plenty of muscle tissue the good news is
within a very wide range building muscle
tissue makes you stronger
certainly makes you strong enough if
you're not competing simultaneously
expense more energy more effort burns
more calories makes you leaner as well
so it's better for health and really
close to equally as good for function
and mobility and
graceful aging the fundamental reason
why
people age poorly in the respective
mobility is
probably muscle loss not some kind of
like oh they still have lots of muscle
but they're neurologically not strong
enough to use it
in addition to that hypertrophy training
is less injurious than strength training
and injury and sustainability
are huge factors for older folks a lot
of older power lifters will still train
for hypertrophy after they retire in the
40s 50s
60s they'll do pumps they'll do machines
they'll do some reps
but they don't go super heavy anymore
even very heavy because their joints and
stuff like that just can't take it and
or they're just not willing to do the
risk
so my view is it's actually the opposite
of this but uh maybe
jason has some other good points that i
haven't considered james what do you
think
yeah so i kind of am splitting the
difference here but i largely agree with
you
um so jason does have some good points
and the reason why
i don't know this to be true but what i
would assume is that they have shown
that
strength is very much associated with
quantity and quality of life and
reducing comorbidities from a variety of
sources
so the stronger you are bottom line the
less likely you are to die
for a variety of reasons right whether
they're kind of internal or you get hit
by a bus
whatever right if you're stronger person
you're less likely to die and less like
and more likely to be independent as you
get older
but um that being said you don't have to
literally train
strength in that sense to get those same
benefits really
what what you can do instead of training
you know for
one to five reps i mean you can train
five to ten reps 10 to 20 reps
and that will activate those type 2
motor units you know maybe not as
raw stimulus as some of the the heavy
lifting well but enough to keep them
from atrophying and decaying which is
what you are trying to avoid with old
age
so the point the point being like yes
strength is
very very important as you get older but
you don't have to think of it in the
literal sense of like
one to five rep strength it's like yeah
that's that's good
but that's also uh associated with
having more muscle mass too
right and so you can get the same effect
of maintaining
those alpha motor units so they don't
decay and wither away uh from doing the
same good old hypertrophy training that
we've been recommending for a long time
and it's probably more sustainable and
has a variety of other good benefits
like mike already mentioned especially
the metabolic benefits
so i think that um although you should
keep in the back of your mind like if
you notice your strength is going down
that's
probably not great but i think
ultimately all signs converge to
hypertrophy training being a superior
choice for a variety of reasons
not to mention just looking good naked
darren hawkins
daryn
that's a good title for an adult oh dear
and you fucking daryl
uh james what do you think about title
for an adult film control f
oh i like it i like it
all right windows f less interesting
yeah uh
james remember you have that windows
phone and they just stopped making
updates for it and they told you yeah
stop i loved that phone they were just
like look if you got one of these
get fucked i was like come on i actually
like this phone they're like nah
nah get the fuck out of here oh man
all right come on darren hawkins
asks would gym goers who build a bank of
nuclei
in their early years benefit when they
get elderly would it prevent
death only the singularity will prevent
death my friend
the death part's a joke james was this a
joke question or is this a serious
question i can't tell you the last part
joke the first one i think is serious so
uh and it's not build a bank of nuclei
it's translocate nuclei from satellite
cells
into actual functioning muscle cells
okay
and the answer to that couldn't tell if
that's where we were going or
for sure so here's the thing like in
order to translocate nuclei
you need to train really hard for a long
time when you're
elderly sometimes you can't do that
anymore
and it's been shown pretty reliably
that people who train hard when they're
younger through their lives are just
more muscular
when they get older than people who are
elderly and pick it up when they're
elderly
which a lot of times it's much easier
said than done
so absolutely it will help you and the
key
also is the best way to do it is
consistency start training when you're
young
never quit and after age 50 60 you will
start to get weaker
but like you might die when you're about
as strong as the average
15 year old versus as strong as the
average
two-year-old and holy shit the average
15-year-old can get around in life no
problem
you know what i mean yeah they're not
like a 25 year old adult male strength
but
damn close and if you're 90 and as
strong as a regular 15 year old or
something
shit man you're well on your way so old
man strength is a real thing
right you have the benefit of being able
to accrue muscle over a very long period
of time
throughout your life and by the time
you're actually starting to see muscle
loss you might be a pretty gnarly old
man
yeah and that's really the goal here is
to become a gnarly old man
james this next question asker is the
easiest name ever
thanos oh
how did he get that name that's good i
mean damn
it must have run on youtube immediately
and he's it is his profile pictures got
that weird chin
god dude
who ron pearlman was thanos right or was
it somebody
no no it wasn't even prominent fuck uh
no it was a guy who was in deadpool uh
fuck
he was also in the goonies
fuck shawn aston is that no no
no no no no ah i'm gonna get roasted for
this one
shit uh josh brolin
brolin he even has bro his name
[Laughter]
he's awesome folks if you haven't
watched the goonies i watched it on a
flight not too long ago
you're going to see a lot of actors that
you know and they're
they're fucking children it's such a
trip go back and watch it
it's really it's a trip
all right thanos has an interesting
question he said
after conquering worlds i've been a
competitive power lift for the past four
years they got very obese to hit all my
goals
i successfully got the total i want to
now i'm 40 pounds down and intend on
losing another 10 to 15.
recently i've gotten into wanting to
learn and excel at the olympic lifts of
doing athletic work like speed agility
and quickness drills my question is when
i get back to a mass phase
can i do all five lifts to not only
regain my loss
strength of the big three but also alert
to make progress on the olympic lifts
and also simultaneously have a
successful hypertrophy phase
or would i be better off using the big
three aboard
a bar press the button or would it be
better to use the big
three and other rep ranges along with
lots of accessories and some olympic
weightlifting so i can build as much
muscle as possible while also doing all
five lifts
so i purchase your weightlifting cycle
but using the big three five percent to
keep adaptation my main goal
is to get as much muscle as possible
while also performing and improving on
these lifts
james this is all you my friend yes so
you're running into the problem of
trying to do too many things at once you
have to kind of
funnel your goals into something that
you can put a lot of energy into
and get a lot of payout in return
unfortunately if you're trying to do
like
hypertrophy strength olympic lifting
power speed quickness agility
you're going to be making very minimal
if no if not at all progress in many
areas and so
you can do that if it tickles your fancy
if it makes you feel good that's fine so
i won't argue against that
but if the question is like am i going
to have a successful hypertrophy phase
am i going to have a successful training
block right the answer is largely no
um and that's just from objective
criteria of like performance
improvements and things like that so
i think the latter the latter one you
gave was was probably much better like
you can use the big three or their
variance which is probably a better idea
in those hypertrophy ranges and then you
could also just
incorporate some some basic technique
stuff on the olympic lifts using
mostly sub-maximal loads building up
your technique building up your
positional awareness and the various
derivatives and then eventually after
you do your hierarchy phase you can
switch over to the maintenance phase and
then you can start training more
strength and then start
increasing the intensity of your olympic
lifting again like
if if you were to press mike and i
really hard and say like should i
include elements of hypertrophy power
lifting and olympic lifting in the same
program that's oriented towards
hypertrophy i mean if it's a yes or no
answer it's a hard
no but if you don't mind making some
compromise because those other things
make you happy
you can include elements of those things
make some nominal progress mostly in the
area of technique
which can face potentiate into gains
down the long term that's kind of the
issue i would
and frankly i would i don't want to
don't i'm not trying to be an asshole
just take the speed agility quickness
drills out of there i mean like one of
those things i think
as we get as we get older we want to
feel like we're still
athletic like unless you're planning on
stepping on a rugby pitch or a soccer
pitch or volca whatever
don't do it it's a waste of time i'm
guilty of it too i'm
i'm just as guilty and that's why i'm
that's why i'm telling you it's a waste
of time
take it from a guy who's who's who's
living that old boy's rugby life
right don't it's do it for fun
that's fine but don't train it yeah
yeah 100 and especially when you're
getting back and your
your goal is to like you know get back
to your
prime ish strength you got to take that
seriously you have to take the basic
approach
just assuming that you're essentially
saying yeah i'm gonna like just get into
all this
just become amazing at all of it at the
same time like gee whiz you know i
wish it worked like that probably just
not the case
yeah that's it
and that's it james that's all of our
questions for this time oh
man i feel like that one flew by folks
man
that was fun that was a good one i like
our format now i like the youtube format
yeah it's not terrible thiago was
busting my chops like when are we what
i need the zoom live ideas like we
haven't gone zoom live
for like over a year or something like
that i remember but it was funny he was
like oh shit
i was like yeah that's fine don't worry
about it um okay i guess that's it
mike is there anything fun coming up on
uh rp or rp youtube or anything no
well tons of rp youtube all the time we
got all kinds of stuff coming so just
keep stay tuned and subscribe
but the real thing is folks if you ask
your questions and you want them
answered uh write them in every webinar
and and write them in early so more
people see them and can upvote them if
they like them and honestly like
look because you might not get your
question answered
um to make it better for everyone
including yourself
if you just after you submit your
question
you know at least like upvote at least a
couple of questions that you really
stick out to you and maybe like
split the shit in half up vote half and
donut both the ones like
go maybe like if there's 10 questions
when you posted browse each one and be
like okay upvote that's good
nah that's not good i thought that's
good now that's not good and then in the
end we're going to get lots of
votes and be really sure that we're
answering the questions that like
a lot more people want to see because
that's just that's how we're doing it
here so
give that some thought awesome i don't
really have much uh it's just
from uh just for some developmental
stuff so i'm actually going to be
submitting
finally a draft zero of our uh another
and
another rendition of our volume
landmarks book and this one's going to
be more geared towards developing
fitness skills and tactics in sport and
the proper kind of scientific approach
to sport training what we like to call
evidence-based practice so hopefully
i'll be submitting a draft zero to our
rp group and hopefully they'll give you
some good feedback it's gonna be myself
uh chad wesley smith is contributor jake
reed who's really great is also a
contributor and of course mike's gonna
look over everything make sure i didn't
fuck anything up too bad
and of course you know i've written
quite a bit of it and so that's kind of
hopefully going to be
on the horizon i don't want to give any
dates because i don't want to get
anything wrong but
that's in the works and i hopefully
hopefully everyone will enjoy
that's all i got awesome awesome folks
folks thank you so much thanks for
engaging with us we will see you next
time
