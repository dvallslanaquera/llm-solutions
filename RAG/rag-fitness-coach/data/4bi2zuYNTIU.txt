hey folks
dr mike is here for renaissance
periodization rplus
we've got the last lecture in
hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture 32 modifying the program
that we wrote in the last lecture
lecture 31
so let's take a look at what's in store
in the last lecture lecture 31 if you
haven't seen that lecture do not watch
this one yet
we built a sample program but it's just
week one of the sample program
today in this lecture we're going to
find out how to alter volumes loads and
our irs through the program
as the client adapts in the accumulation
phase
and then we're going to figure out how
to deload and move on to the next muscle
cycle
let's get right into it here are the
five steps to program modification
so you got seven steps to write one five
steps to modify
number one is to designate weekly
targets for reps in reserve
and as the weeks progress our reps in
reserve are probably going to go down
we want the targets very clear because
we're going to aim for them
we are going to figure out how to
progress in load and reps
which i'm going to introduce you to the
match or beat process
uh we have a youtube video on that out
already
so that's going to be something that you
want to watch
on youtube by itself if you really want
more insights but we'll explain it
really well here
and then number three we're going to
figure out how to progress in volume
very easy actually we're going to
construct the deload and then we're
going to figure out how to plan our next
mesocycle given the information we
learned
in the current one so sample client
review we got this whole program here
all the stuff written in we're ready we
have the days of the week
monday through friday after training we
have the muscle groups they're using we
have the exercises they're using
we have the loading ranges they're using
and we have the
reps in reserve as two for the first
week of training
now we need to figure out reps in
reserve for all of the other weeks
generally speaking from a theoretical
basis that was covered in earlier videos
a reps of reserve should range from
anywhere between three and four in most
cases
all the way to zero reps in reserve true
technical failure or
the next rep would have been in most
hypertrophy programs
okay sweet now the overload now so three
to four does that mean every single week
has to be our ir2
or maybe every single week should be r3
or every single week should be our ir1
because it's everything's good in this
range well there's a bit more nuance to
it
overload need in week one is actually
fairly minimal new exercises that we've
just deloaded
fresh exposure we actually don't need to
work very hard to get very robust gains
and we have to think about how much
fatigue we're adding because that
fatigue is going to accumulate for the
rest of the program we want to add a
minimal amount of fatigue
but get a really good amount of gains
the best way to do that is probably
starting on the lower end of the
reps and reserve range so start the
program at like three or four reps in
reserve probably a good idea
and as the weeks progress we can keep
the reps in reserve
at three or four but that's sort of just
at the very bottom
end of what we could do and that means
we have to do a lot more sets to get the
same effect
and there may be some unique benefits
from going all the way up to failure
so as the weeks progress we can keep rar
three or four or if we start at two we
can keep it to two
but uh we miss out on the middle or our
training so a really good method that
solves all these problems at the same
time
is to move from the highest rir's like
three or four ups away from failure
all the way to zero rir or basically
close to technical failure at it
over the weeks so basically that means
something like you do a week or two at
r3 then a week or two at r2 then a week
or two at our ir1 and then a week or two
at rr0
and then you deload because by then your
fatigue is going to be crazy high you'll
probably have hit your maximum recovery
volumes already
so on and so forth and there's only so
much
so much you can do when you've added
tons of volume and you're going to
failure you're going to hit your mrv
within a week almost certain so
for early intermediates oftentimes they
can get away with spending one to two
weeks
on each rir so if they start at three or
four rir they can get like an eight-week
program out of that
beginners can do even longer uh for
advanced individuals one week
at each rar is plenty usually because
they accumulate fatigue so fast
if you want to match or beat your
earlier performances from week to week
to week and ensure an overload
then uh it just might not be possible to
do more than one week at each rir
because you may not survive longer than
four weeks of accumulation so
generally speaking for intermediate to
advanced one to two weeks at each rir
when we do our example here we're going
to demonstrate one week at each rir just
for super super simplicity
so here's the sample are our targets
for just one exercise because we don't
want to blot everything out the whole
screen is going to get super messy
but for example let's take a look at
tuesday four sets of five to ten uh rep
range
incline bench in the first week
it's two rar in the second week the
target is one rir so we're gonna
actually try to get one rep
in reserve in the week three we're gonna
go all the way
no reps in a reserve and then of course
come to the d-load and we'll get the r
start for that in just a bit
okay so we've got the rir targets
figured
now we have to figure out how to
progress in load
and possibly in repetitions right here's
the thing
the main target of progression and
hypertrophy training
is relative effort rir
week to week should either be the same
as the weeks go on of accumulation or
better yet
progressed to lower and lower rars
so if your progression is you start at
3rir and then you go to 4ir and then 5r
you're actually doing
less and less relative effort as you go
not remotely hypertrophic is stimulating
to the maximum not even close
if you go 3 ri r3 r3 r that's okay
but it's better to go 3 rar 2 rar 1 r 0
r
so on and so forth okay make it
progressive a little bit harder so
remember we already set those goals as
getting closer and closer to failure
each and every week
how you do this is a much smaller
concern so long as you do it you have
essentially two options and you can
actually use a combination of both
the first option is okay you did a
certain amount of weight this week
and then you got a certain number of
reps and the next week
you can increase the load to a certain
amount
to where you hit basically the same reps
at your new r target
right so you just load was here and then
now load is here
and it was 2rir and now it's one same
reps between them
or you can add reps instead of adding
load that's option two
you did 12 reps 2 ir here and then now
you need one rir
so how many reps do you think that'll be
well you know you gain a little bit of
technical
foundation you're building a little
muscle under the hood and your
endurances or work capacity is going up
so maybe that's 13 reps right and then
the next week will the 14 reps and then
you'll dealer so on and so forth so it
doesn't matter if you had reps or if you
had load
you just need to add enough to hit your
rar target
either at the same reps and a little bit
of load or at the same load at a little
bit of reps
to get that rar where you want it to be
can it be a combination sure you can add
like five pounds and one rep
or you can add 10 pounds and zero reps
or you can add
zero pounds and two reps the the world
is yours i would use one of the other
mostly for simplicity in most cases
right machines and barbells are best
suited
mostly to option number one because you
can increase load by small fractions
and it makes it very very simple and
also
a lot of times you know if you're doing
sets of five to ten
adding reps is a huge huge uh stimulus
increase and a huge fatigue increase
that might not be a possibility to do
our ir so for example
if you did 400 for six reps in the
deadlift
how many you know can you add one rep to
get to rer that was rar3
rar2 might be you know
you can you know 400 for seven could be
rr0
i think if that's how much harder it is
think about this way you've got
six fractions of 400 pounds you're
adding a seventh one that's a giant
increase in volume load that's very very
tough to pull off and you might
overshoot your ir
but if you go from 400 to 405 i mean
instead of
1 7 of an addition you're talking about
whatever
whatever five pounds divided by four
hundred pound four or four hundred as i
have no fucking clue or 400 divided by
five
what is that that's gonna be 400 divided
by five
so 80 yeah 80.
180th of an increase in difficulty so to
speak
versus 1 7 holy crap right
whereas with dumbbells you may want to
add reps because usually you don't do
dumbbells in the five different rep
range anyway that's 10 to 20 or 20 to
30.
and how the hell are you supposed to add
load to dumbbells you get the magnetic
plates i used to use those they're
pretty cool
but sometimes when you do like flies
they fly off and hit people i've never
hit anyone with one but i've had
them fly off and a training partner of
mine jared skinner i love you wherever
you are
uh he hit dumbbells together at the top
of a set and one of the magnetic plates
fell and hit him right in the face and
all he did was go
ugh and he just kept going which is when
i realized we'd be great training
partners
but you might not want to do that every
day so the magnetic plates have their
limitations adding reps is probably a
better idea for dumbbells you can add
reps on machines and stuff just make
sure
you're not jumping way too ahead of
yourself all right
so let's talk about this fundamentally
what we have here
is we have a baseline performance
certain rir let's say two or three
and then we're going to be shooting for
higher rars and we have to add something
together be it reps or load
how does this process work in reality
okay
at first we look at this when we say
okay we have to hit a certain rar
but rar target hitting can be really
really hard in practice
how can you tell when you've done this
you know one bench press or something
let's say you're on rep number nine
are you at one rir or two where i are or
are you just kidding yourself or are you
at three r
or did you bite off more than you can
chew and you tell yourself you're a two
rer but you're really at zero rir
we've all been there it's tough and it
sucks to have to do this mid-set because
you second-guess yourself like crazy
it's really hard to separate fatigue and
just not trying hard enough and we've
both had
tons of fatigue before and we've all not
tried hard enough before especially in a
given set here and there
but there is a very easy method to match
your beat process
which it's really easy to proxy rir
targets without having to strain the
brain too much and just go on autopilot
and do a good job here it is
number one you do your first week
sessions at your best guess
of your first week's rar usually it's
three ir but in this example it's two
so everything hit your best guess of
what two r is
and write down the reps and write down
the weight no problem
the next week's rar target will be
either the same or a lower than last
week
so some addition of repetitions or load
is usually called for because your
performance is either
stable or goes up if it ever goes down
you've hit mrv and it's time to deload
so it's either stable or goes up so
you're going to be
putting something additionally into your
program is either reps or load or both
okay so
for that next week you add a load for
example
that you think will hit your target rar
you did two here you need one here
so uk i did 200 pounds for 10 reps
and that was 2 ir and i'm gonna do
i need to hit one rir probably that's
gonna be 210 pounds just your guess
here's the thing how do you know you're
not working hard enough if you're not
working hard enough
in the second week you have that rep
goal you did 10. you go at least 10 reps
this time
and see what you finish the 10 and see
what rir that was
if you're adding reps you can add one or
two or however many reps you think
will match that rar goal so you did 15
push-ups on set one and week one
two rir now you need one rir i think how
many push-ups is that going to be
16 is reasonable i think that's that's
fine you do 16 push-ups
you don't just think about it the whole
time you just number 16. that's what i'm
doing
and you go and actually do it you want
to be conservative
so you don't want to think okay i did 15
and a 2 ir i can do 18.
maybe that'll actually be zero rar but
one two reps at a time
five ten pounds on the bar at a time is
it very reasonable to think that your
body will adapt and the thing is if
you've trained for a while you already
know all these numbers
like you know how much weight you can
put on the bar and probably eek out
another rep or get
one rep closer to failure it's not
rocket science
but by having that minimum in just
matching
or beating the reps and or load from the
last week
you have a minimum standard every single
week and then the next week when you do
that your minimum standard goes like
this
so you do 15 reps of 3rir then you do 16
you say okay great i got it maybe that
was 2
ir ish then you know you did 16. next
week's target is one or ir
17 and so on and so on and so on right
if you really screwed up and on one of
the weeks the first set is way too hard
like it's supposed to be rar2
but you get to like one rep away from
your goal and you're failing okay
stop write down your reps and then
reduce the load that you're using
or lower the add a number of reps it's
okay i got 15
reps on the first week i tried to add a
rep
but at 15 i was for sure won our ir next
week i'm not going to go to 17 like i
was planning
15 16 17 that got 15 15.
let's see next week i'm the goal is
going to be since i'm accumulating
fatigue now the goal is going to be 15
again
but uh maybe i'll if i feel good i'll
add another rep that's totally fine to
do
same thing with adding a bit of load or
adding a wrap or two
or fewer okay and you can actually do
that
right on the next set if you'd like so
for example
you did 200 pounds in a squat for you
know
a set of 10 on the first set
the first week and that's two ir now you
do one rir and you say okay
215 pounds you hit 10
except that's for sure zero rir on the
second set you don't have to do 215
pounds
you can say okay 215 was an 88 idiot
move i'm dumb let's go to 205.
and then let's say you did eight reps
last time at 200 2 rir
and this time it's one rir you do
successfully aid at 205 and it pretty
much feels like what are they like ha
got it awesome
and the next sets after that of squats
are 205 because you found your right low
now usually you won't have to do that
sort of thing
but huge recommendation there is to be
conservative because it's always easy to
push out another rep at the end of a set
or it's always easy to push
a little bit more weight on the bar for
the other sets of the exercise if you're
really feeling it's too easy
versus if you go too hard you start
missing reps things get out of whack
who knows what's going on at that point
so number six is the real kicker here
all this super complexity is really
simple
you start and get a certain number of
reps slash weight
at a three rar tour at the beginning of
the program
then at least hit that
and add a little bit each time as well
but at least that
and or add a little as your rr targets
get closer to failure you're going to be
able to add a little bit here and there
that means you're never shortchanging
yourself here's the scenario we want to
avoid
you do a hundred pounds for ten reps
here at two r week one
week two you sort of feel down i don't
know maybe you don't have it
and you look all right i've gotta have
an rr target of
one but like it's all auto regulated
everything's auto regulated so i'm just
gonna do
100 pounds again but like i got 10 last
time but i got eight this time because
it was that was really my
i guess it's fatigue if you follow that
path long enough you will just get to
where everything is excused by laziness
and
at the end of the day lifting weights is
hard and getting close to failure is
hard
you have to have a baseline no bullshit
that keeps you
above that water line i'm going to do at
least this if not better
and then you can push yourself and have
very realistic goals
that three rar whatever you start your
mesoad in this case two
that baseline of sets and reps that you
do with load
is bottom and you go a little bit up and
a little bit up at a least match and
possibly be
possibly beat and if you ever go below
anything that's your mrv detector you're
underperforming
so you have that bottom and then you go
float up from there
right one of two things will happen
either you will eventually hit zero rar
by trying to add and trying to add and
trying to add or you will continue to
get either more
rep endurant or stronger forever you
guys can figure which one of those is
more realistic
okay the cool thing about starting at
the bottom and
at least matching and beating by little
the reps and weight that you have
you have a perfect formula for getting
where you need to go which is zero rir
with small incremental adjustments
that's it
so here's some examples of what that
could look like
we have load edition occurring on monday
so for example just we take the high bar
squats they did 315 pounds
and their monday's reps because they
were doing four sets monday was
uh on week one right they were doing
ten eight seven and two
at two rir okay
on week two we added five pounds and
they did the same exact number of wraps
and that was around one rir
sweet and then we added another five
pounds 335 on week three
same uh repetitions exactly
and it's now zero ir and then we'll be
ready for deload
but that can work differently you can do
repetitions so let's go to wednesday
really quick
wednesday we're doing barbell rows
barbell rows
start in week one
at 185
for 19 15 13 reps a 2 ir
then we go to still 185 no no 8
increases no load increases
but now we have 19 16 and 14 reps
so basically the first set was it pretty
tough we're like ah okay that's one rar
but then the second set was like okay
cool got a couple more reps we'll add
them
and then the last week week three zero
are we get 20 16 and 15. so
remember not all sets have to add the
reps but where you can you add a rep
here and there to target the rer that
you want
easy and lastly we'll take a look at
friday which does
rep and load edition for skull crushers
so take a look at that in your
in your spare time you can pause the
video if you want you'll notice that
sometimes
the load goes up and sometimes the reps
go up and sometimes both
there's no right answer to how to use
these just make sure you're being honest
about hitting a good baseline rir
writing down your reps and load and
slowly trying to progress conservatively
in all of them
eventually by accumulating fatigue and
the fact that you're putting in more
work and more work and more work and
you're not infinitely strong
you will hit zero rir and after you do
this long enough and you do your clients
do it long enough
you get pretty good at figuring out
which rep and load additions get you to
the r0
when you need to but you can always play
catch up in the last week or two
you can say okay it's a second to last
week and everything was easy as hell
well the third week you can make it
considerably harder and definitely hit
zero r
it's always easy to go to failure
because you just keep going until you
can't
right we want to start a conservative 3r
and then go up and up and up and up from
there
no problem at all all right now we've
taken care of represent
reserve goals are our goals for each
week we've taken care of reps and load
what about volume that's the easiest
part
we go back to lecture nine in this
series the set progression algorithm
takes care of all that for us
quick reminder in essence if performance
is being master increase
week to week that is if you can do the
rep and load additions right
and you're not losing reps or load for
the same ir lower
then we add sets and
so long as overlapping certain soreness
is not occurring
if performance is shaky like we have to
push really really hard to match the
last week and we're not supposed to be
pushing that hard yet like if it's an r2
goal but you had to go r0 and a bunch of
exercises to not lose repetitions on
them
then uh if that occurs or overlapping
sirnus occurs so basically we train
chest monday
thursday and uh you know this thursday
chest is still sore for monday
if that occurs then we keep falling the
same we don't change anything because
our body has to get used to it
uh increases work capacity if a
regression occurs
your performance drops then a recovery
session
is in order for later in the week for
that same muscle group or a recovery
half week
we take half a week and do very very low
volumes and
loads and uh that is
really really straightforward otherwise
volume will progress in a completely
auto regulated fashion
check out lecture nine for specifics so
luckily we have all those other lectures
this is just a really simple guide at
this point
so just a sample of what that can look
like
so let's take a look at monday really
quick
uh it looks like sets go up in some of
the weeks
but not all of the weeks right so
for example we start out at
four sets in the squat here and
week one and then in week two it looks
like four sets were still sufficient and
got us all the
you know the disruption we needed and so
on and so forth so it was
sort of borderline it was plenty of work
we didn't need to go up
and that's really good and then
in week three it looks like it wasn't
enough so
we add another set to week three so
not rocket science there and then we can
take a look and see if
we do anything up sets go up once so on
tuesday
we notice that there are five sets in
week one
there are five sets in week two
and week three actually has
an extra set at the tail end of it so it
seems like we needed that there
for wednesday you'll notice that the
sets go up every week just an example of
something that could fall out from our
auto regulations let's go up every week
we start it looks like in week one with
four sets
of barbell rows and we end with six sets
in week three super and just one at a
time
and then on thursday and friday we note
that this is an example
of the sets actually never going up okay
so it's totally
totally possible that that occurs
all right so we figure out how to
progress through the entire accumulation
phase
at some point we have to deload so once
the last week is finished
the dealer is super easy a really good
approach that you can start with and
play around
is to cut the sets and reps
in half in the first part of the week
actually in the entire week
and then only in the second half we cut
the weight in half as well it's not
dogma this isn't exactly the way to do
everything
but if you bring fatigue down and when
you do
you should bring it down hard because
muscle really doesn't go away
even if you train very easy in just one
week but fatigue can hang in there if
you're training even remotely hard so
this is going to be a huge reduction
let's take a look at a sample of what
that would look like so we take a look
at the d-load week here all the way uh
to the right hand
we notice so in week 3 this individual
has done 335 pounds in high bar squats
for ten eight eight seven six five reps
zero rer tough week in the deload he's
going to do so he did how many one two
three four five six sets remember sets
get cut in half so it looks like he's
doing
three sets right there in the deload
okay super
and it looks like he's cutting reps in
half okay
if it's an odd number of sets
or odd number of reps and you have to
cut them in half
then you can usually do one more
uh or one fewer than the the halfway
point
so if it's let's say seven reps you have
to do half
you're not gonna do three and a half
reps that's ridiculous you can either do
three or four and it's
really not a big deal which one you
choose right i'll put this way if you're
really messed up or the clients are
really really beat up
three if the client's like ah that's too
easy
four either way it accomplishes roughly
the same thing right
and so looks like this same week three
waits for the deload all the way through
wednesday
but then look at thursday friday that's
the second half of the week now we
implement
the formula where we cut the loads in
half he was doing 340 pounds in the
stiff legged deadlift
for sets of 765 etc now it's 170 pounds
halfway
and just two sets because he was doing
four sets there at the peak were three
sets and we said okay we're going to err
on the side of moore
and it's just two sets of three and
three folks that's
easy okay that's barely a warm-up which
is exactly what we want that second half
of the d-load because we're priming up
dropping fatigue to do another
incredibly difficult accumulation phase
after
and then friday looks like much of the
same right really really really
straightforward
now we'll finish the deload
during the time that they're executing
the deload you can write
your next plan wherever you're writing
for their next plan
we have to make sure that when we're
writing the next mouse cycle
we have to incorporate all the changes
that you have to make
from previous lectures exercise deletion
and replacement
adjusting the load as motorcycles go on
rep range adjustments and
usually here we follow the block
architecture if possible
we go from mostly heavy work to moderate
work
to mostly light work re-sensitization as
a repeat so on and so forth in this
previous lecture
on face potentiation of load and of reps
and all that stuff that we've uh
referenced
and in addition to that you want to
really take note on the recovery and
stimulus dynamics for all the muscle
groups that they've trained
over the last meso and use them to do
two things at least
one is alter the frequency in the next
mazda for example they train hamstrings
twice a week
they got up to doing eight sets of
hamstrings every single workout
and they recovered just fine and there
was never any overlapping soreness and
barely any soreness at all
well gee if hamstrings are their
priority it's probably time to go to
three sessions of hamstrings a week
because they can clearly do a ton of
work they're getting to the point where
they're doing so much hamstring work in
one session that systemic fatigue
and local fatigue accumulation is
preventing them
from getting really enough work through
the week so it's time to go up in
sessions where on the other hand
they were doing three sessions of chest
and they barely added any volume
and they were overlapping soreness a
bunch of times maybe go down to two
sessions because you might just not need
three to accomplish whatever it is you
want so on and so forth
and of course keep tabs on the sfrs of
the exercises
the sfrs of the rep ranges and so on and
so forth so if they
loved cable curls and they got crazy
pumps for them that's a five to ten reps
or whatever
maybe you'll do more of that if they
hated you know the v grip push downs
for sets of 15 to 20 they didn't feel
anything except hurt elbows you might
take that out and replace it with
something so on and so forth so you're
always learning about every every part
of the process
folks that's it you now
know all the stuff about hypertrophy
concepts and tools that we've covered
we've designed a mesocycle we've
adjusted the mesocycle's progression
we've built the deload we've
given you the tools to design the next
message cycle uh
that's it for this series 32 big
lectures
in and we hopefully know some things uh
go forth and make intelligent decisions
about programming intelligence decisions
about
regulation do a good job and if folks
are interested
in how the stuff works and really want
to up their knowledge refer them to
these videos and hopefully more people
can do better
you
