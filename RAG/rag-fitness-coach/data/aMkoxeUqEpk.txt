hey folks dr michael cartell here for
rplus and rpu
lecture number two in the theory of
science course
study let's get into the the rules of
study design aka how science is actually
done
what are we going to talk about today
we're going to talk about
the flow of
the certainty and expansiveness of
information
from the least likely or
sort of least set in stone which is
notion all the way to the most set in
stone understanding which is
theory we're also going to talk about
how people use the term theory
wrong 97 percent of the time
it's going to piss you off later after
you watch this video you're never going
to look at theory again and you're going
to start correcting people and you're
going to run out of friends and you're
going to be hopeless and alone
which is the point of most of these
courses secondly we're going to talk
about how to generate a precise
hypothesis which is actually a bit of an
uphill battle
and just trying to generate a hypothesis
already makes you think so much more
clearly about the world
so much more scientifically it's
valuable as its own exercise
we're going to talk about confounders
that is when you see the world even
through a scientific lens
and you're trying to distinguish between
what causes
uh lead to what effects it's not always
100
clear that you're seeing what you think
you're seeing
that what you think is causing something
is really what it's causing it and
that's what confounders are
but we have ways to deal with that which
is through
study validity there's two types
basically
two fundamental types you can get much
more uh gradations if you get in a
little deeper which we won't do in this
uh overview course
there's internal validity and external
validity basically internal validity
we've got to get a lot
uh through a lot of stuff there is the
idea that your study
is set up to actually examine what you
think it's examining
external validity is how com we apply
the results of your study to the actual
world
and sometimes they come in a trade-off
to each other so we'll talk about all
that
at the end of this lecture you'll have a
much better understanding of how to read
studies
and how to determine if studies are
really concluding what they think
they're concluding
to what extent they are concluding what
they think they're concluding how
powerful the conclusion is
and basically how many grains of salt
you need to swallow
given any study because you'll read some
studies and you'll be like wow that is
really phenomenal
you know they really concluded what they
think they did and this is a pretty
pretty gold
study that we can include in our grand
view of what's going on
other studies at the other end of the
spectrum you're going to look at them
like this is just basically garbage and
a study just doesn't conclude
anything we can reliably say is the
reality
right every study ever done lies
somewhere on the spectrum between the
two
and we can grade them according to how
well they fit
this understanding let's get right into
it first up
super important terms in science we have
essentially four ways
of categorizing things we think we
understand
there are many many other ways to look
at this but this is a pretty good one
so probably might be worth your time
the first one is what
economist and philosopher thomas sol
terms notion now from what i'm aware
this
there's other terms for notion um the
way he uses notions specifically is the
way i'll be using it so if you ever get
curious you know
google thomas soul and notion and he's
got articles
about how he uses that term and the way
he uses it and what we'll be using here
is basically an idea that is assumed to
be true
people say it and it's never really
precisely articulated and it's not
really a fully formed idea for example
and here's the thing a notion can
actually after we filter through a
couple of these other ones end up being
completely true or almost completely
true
or it can end up being completely false
the problem is
the way a notion is stated it's really
difficult to tell
if it's true or false or anything in
between so
for example we can go after something
that is actually has a lot of validity
but it's still stated notionally
squats are good
okay what what does that mean
right people like imagine uh you know
someone coming up to you in the gym and
talking shop with you you know someone
is not training for a while
and they say oh you know like so look
what do i do in the gym like squats are
good right
what are you really gonna think like uh
there's definitely that notion that
squats are good
before we actually answer the question
of what they're good we could ask the
very rudimentary next question of
what for like good for what like
are squats good way to spend time on
thanksgiving with your family
no right are they a good way to try to
build an advanced weapon system to
destroy a planet
no definitely not okay so they're just
definitely not a universal good
okay very few of those by the way all
right
so the good for what our squad's a good
way let's zoom in okay so we're not
trying to build a weapon system but
we're trying to be in the gym and get
fit
well fit for what you know our squats
good for people trying to get big arms
no again no are they good for people
trying to get big legs maybe
likely if we zoom in even further and
say are they good
for people who want to build big quads
yeah very much closer to the answer
being yes
but now that's not a notion anymore
right that is a much more
specifically stated idea him
starts to look a whole lot more like a
hypothesis which we'll get to in just a
second
right so that idea we're saying now is
well i believe that in the context of a
well-periodized plan
for most individuals squats are a very
effective
and a good trade-off of fatigue to
stimulus way of growing the quadriceps
yeah that's not a notion like can you
imagine someone coming up to you in the
gym you'll be like yo buddy i saw you
lifting let me ask you a question a
squat's a programmatic way
to implement quad hypertrophy
specifically for my goals but wait what
what the hell
damn you sure don't sound like you say
that stuff but yes technically i guess
right so a notion is usually a very
simple statement that a very
blanket statement often and and you know
it's got a good chance there's there's
definitely some notions have a lot of
grains of truth
and some notions kind of don't here's
another notion
natural food is good for you like man
you know we've got to get a definition
of what natural
food means we have to get a definition
of what good for you means
and here's the deal notions are cool you
know as a way of thinking about stuff
you don't care to learn much about
but if you really want to know shit and
i mean
know it very precisely know it enough so
that it can be actionable
and those actions can have a good
probability of leading to what you want
right if you want to engineer outcomes
around yourself
whatever it is training life anything
you want to go a step further than
notions
notions are cheap really cheap right
you got to go to the next which is a
hypothesis so a hypothesis
is an idea that is precisely defined
so that it can be tested another way of
thinking about it is it's a
serious guess about how things work
right
so a notion is an idea that is assumed
to be true
which is already bad right because
there's no good reason to assume it's
true
and that is not very complicated it's
not very specific and it's not very
clearly defined
so it can mean a whole lot or it can
mean a whole lot of nothing right
notions carry very little information
hypotheses carry more information so a
hypothesis could be you know
i hypothesize which is by the way a
serious guess
that because of the biomechanics of
squatting because of my personal
experience with myself and
loads of my clients because of the
accumulated wisdom of the bodybuilding
community over years
i hypothesized that squats are a very
effective way
to trigger hypertrophic stimulus in the
quadriceps muscles
if done in a particular way that is
relevant to good technique right you
would have to you could do a little bit
more sub defining there what good
technique means
but basically man that's a pretty
precise definition i mean we can always
get it more precise but
as you can tell that second part of the
definition there it's a serious guess
like you're not fucking around anymore
you're actually saying look this is how
i think things work
i've taken a real good load of time to
make sure i'm really precise about what
i mean
right so hypothesis remember that
doesn't
it it could be totally wrong right i
hypothesize
that i have instead of a heart you know
a class ii
fusion generator yeah so that's an
interesting hypothesis i wish
probably give me dragon ball z powers
but but unfortunately that's probably
not true
but a hypothesis at least goes better
than a notion because it's
more precise it's a serious guess and
it's not just an assumption of truth
that's one thing you don't want to do in
science be like yeah that's true right
like
is it though you gotta get a little bit
more precise and
actually test stuff now here's the next
part hypotheses
that have been confirmed through a
variety of ways
through a conciliance of confirmation
from all
angles over a long course of time
can rise to the level of facts
okay so some people say like oh yeah you
know your facts
facts are more important than your
feelings i hope when they're saying that
they actually are referring to things
that are facts not you know very biased
political opinions that are just not
true so on and so forth
facts in sort of the way
scientists think about the world boy man
they're
real real rarefied air
there are very few things that can be
stated as fact
for example if you followed any of my
other lectures
uh you know that uh my colleague my
coach broderick chavez and i
have like a high carb mass hypothesis
now we have like six different
lines of reasoning and evidence to
support it we think it's very likely to
be correct
but because we're not quite sure exactly
its magnitude of effect
and we can't rule out that there's some
pretty decent but small chance that
its effect is zero we still call it a
high carb mass
hypothesis this is a very good guess
it's got a lot of data behind it but
it's not convincing data
so what does it take for something to be
anointed as a fact
well a couple things it's got to be
confirmed
through multiple lines which means what
anecdote
what is it what does that mean that
means it's gotta actually fucking happen
you know like people have fucking seen
it
right like like uh you're a hypebearer
it's a fact that some dude can lift a
car
well he better have fucking lifted a car
this shit better be on video
right now maybe there was trickery
involved which is why anecdotes not good
enough
right uh maybe the car was uh gutted and
it was lighter than a regular car
maybe it was just all the youtube prank
and the shit was like digitally
remastered or some shit
right but at least some people have to
fucking have seen some shit anecdote
bare minimum like boom this just fucking
happened
all right but anecdotes not enough right
because of all those things it could be
illusory
next logic it has to make some fucking
sense
right probably pretty good sense
for example you look at the person
lifting a car
and they weigh 440 pounds and their
quads are the size of car tires
and their hands are the size of toasters
and you're like huh
well cross-sectional area is predictive
of strength and
uh this person is pretty well leveraged
to well do some shit that's like lifting
a car like it
fucking makes sense if something about
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
i don't know about fact then it's just a
hypothesis
all right right that this is
hypothetically this man can lift a car
and i know we have some evidence
which is a video but you know he's going
to have to do it under more controlled
conditions blah blah blah so it has to
make
some fucking sense sometimes things can
be fact and not make any goddamn sense
but then they have to have a whole
lot of the other stuff like physicists
have just confirmed this measurement
over and over and over we have no idea
how we get it
but it definitely happens that might be
a fact even
i would even say that's a strong
hypothesis right but it's gotta it's
gotta
fit into our logical schema of
everything else we know
at least fit in as much as it's like
tenable like okay i can see how this
happens it doesn't have to be like this
is exactly what i would predict
but it'd be like okay it fits in it's
not like totally discordant
totally crazy like what the fuck is that
going on right so it's anecdotally gotta
be true shit actually have to happen
it's gotta make some fucking sense
next is uh in our field especially not
like in physics or anything
practical experience has to probably
confirm it
at some point all right so what does
that mean like if people say well
hypothetically
like you know so anecdote this guy got
jacked using this weird
program scientists developed where he
does like one a one rep max every 15
minutes for three days straight and then
he rests for two and then he repeats it
right okay anecdotes cool
logic it makes sense because you know
high forces lead to hypertrophy or gay
so logically it's fine
uh practical experience who who the fuck
else got jacked off this program
right nobody so when you say okay
is it it's a fact that this works
not yet it's a it's a very interesting
hypothesis
and the scientists that design the
program if they're worth their weight
right in science um they'll say hey you
know we have this interesting super new
training theory with
or sorry super new i made that my own
mistake uh super new training idea that
we've developed
new training hypothesis that this is a
cool way to train that probably leaves
hypertrophy
but they're going to tell you themselves
if they're good scientists like look you
know it worked in a lab
um we'd really i honestly like to see
people try it in the field to see if it
really musters up because some things
seem to work in the lab don't work in
the field because a variety of
conditions could be very different
or it's just a one shot one off or
statistical error who knows right
so there's got to be practical
experience right so let's let's let's
we've squats through this
anecdotally have people gotten big legs
squatting fuck yeah logically does it
make sense makes total sense practical
experience especially summed up over
many generations of thousands and
thousands and millions of lifters
totally right and what about research
last one is research and research so
there has to be
good scientific examination why because
science is the only method
that allows us and we'll see later to
quiet the noise of statistical error
to quiet the noise of confounding
effects like could be this but it could
be that
could be this other thing we didn't even
think about enough research that's very
well done like we'll describe here
quiets all that noise and really allows
you to see
reality very clearly it's a very limited
view but it's a very clear view
and if you really think squats get your
legs big they had better fucking get
them big in a lab too
it can't just happen like well
anecdotally it happens that's good
enough for me like
man if there's an effect really there
good research is gonna find that effect
and if
over and over and over studies simply
can't find it
a good example is like weight loss
through keto people swear by the shit
and swear that calories don't matter as
long as you drop your carbs you can eat
as many calories as you
want you can eat a ton of calories and
still lose weight well
anecdotally there's tons of that
logically it doesn't make a whole lot of
sense but
let's say we go skip that part practical
experience tons of people have it and
they seem to think it works
what about research well every time we
do a metabolic wart study on keto
and we drop the carbs and raise the fats
we don't see any kind of magic weight
loss for some reason when
people's activity and diet is completely
controlled by scientists
all the magical effects go away so
definitely the the fact that you can
lose tons of weight and eat a ton of
calories
by a keto is not a fact it's still a
hypothesis
right sometimes it's a notion too that's
you know really unfortunate
so all of these things have to come
together notice
we have to have anecdote you have to
have logic you have to have practical
experience
and research beyond a reasonable doubt
beyond a reasonable doubt so
every one of those has to be like yeah
yeah fits the bill
anecdote we got it so let's take a look
at the car lifting guy
lifted a car people saw it uh live they
saw there we have cell phone videos on
youtube
sweet logically he's fucking enormous
and he's super strong and he's a world
record holding power lifter okay so it
makes sense anyone could lift a car he
probably could
and you sort of get the weight of the
car you do like the vector analysis and
you're like okay
he lifted the back of the car which is
lighter than the front um
we have like an idea of how much that
weighs and if you you work all the
the trigonometry you're like okay well
it's actually like 700 pounds in his
hands
he's dead lifted like 980 in competition
like okay it was
clearly within his abilities it's not
like you know it's like 2 000 pounds
you're like the fuck that doesn't make
any sense
practical experience like you know
there's like the world's strongest man
they've literally like dead lifted cars
before like that's an event
so that's happened over and over and
people have done it and so you're like
okay well okay
so clearly it's just happened it's not
just anecdotal like there's a lot of
practical experience saying that is
possible and feasible
um and then research beyond a reasonable
doubt we get the guy in the lab we get
like a mock car set up to exert the same
kind of forces he does it
and and boom boom voila problem solved
in fact he can fucking lift a car
right that's it so if you can't get that
it's just even semblance of degree of
certainty about all those things you
can't call shit facts
right so you can't say well this is the
fact that blah blah
might just be a notion i'll tell you
nine out of ten times people say
if this is a fact notion it is not even
remotely examined
right the other point nine times it's
just a hypothesis
okay and then point one times it's
actually a fact
all right so facts are you know science
uh on the grand scheme of everything we
think we know facts occupy a tiny
percent of that
which is bad because we know no a lot of
shit that's not true
but it's good because facts have to be
elite they have to be the one percent
hopefully they're gonna grow right two
three four five you know when alien
advanced society has 90
facts or some shit like that um but the
facts are special
and they should be because really really
really have been
really confirmed it's as sort of
thinking
rational well-meaning people when we say
something as a fact that means we
did our fucking damnedest to try to
figure that shit out and we're
really fucking confident it's true now
sometimes facts get deposed back to
hypotheses
sometimes they get disproved right but
that doesn't happen that often
it really does um you know people think
uh for example a lot of the quote
unquote facts that science have like you
know people will say
you say i love science like yeah i don't
know about science like they seem to
just refute their own facts every couple
of years or every couple of generations
or every couple like lifetimes and
you're like really is that true
and you ask them for an example of that
and what they give you is actually
notions
right because motherfuckers usually
don't even know the difference between
facts and notions
so they'll say you know they used to
think the earth was the center of the
universe like uh-huh
and you call that a fact like yeah that
was a fact like
let's go to fact let's see was it
anecdotally confirmed to be the center
of the universe
uh no you know you know how fucking big
you already
know anything to make belief so there's
not even an anecdote there like i guess
we're here and
the sun kind of sort of circles around
us and the star sort of seemed to circle
around us
okay it was a given anecdote logic is it
logically inferrable
with any degree of certainty that humans
and and the earth should be the center
of the universe
fuck no what a ridiculous egotistical
thing right even if you happen to be a
theist and you believe in god and
creation and all that
okay uh how do you know god doesn't have
like a fucking super important fucking
planet and
you know the vega system that is really
his fucking chosen people you know the
fuckers would be
you know he tried he fucking sent all
the disciples down and we fucking killed
them all and he's like oh fuck these
people
he's over there doing some other shit
he's barely paying attention to us maybe
right
so you don't even know that logically it
should be in further center of the
universe
practical experience fuck even get
practical experience something like that
right there's no telescopes back then
there's not even any fucking data on
what the
universe structure looks like this is
this might not even be a way to get
practical experience
and then uh what about um well okay i'll
actually give you a good example of
practical experience there
um we actually have measured the
structure of the universe
uh hypothetically this has never
happened we have concluded
uh based and we basically have a
hypothesis that we're the center of the
universe
and a couple of predictions fall out of
that hypothesis like if this is really
true
x y and z also have to be true like
radio waves have to bounce off a certain
way
we have to see like redshift or
blueshift with the planets and the stars
and then you go through that checklist
and
all these shits are true so that's like
practical experience basically looking
at telescopes and shit
that says yeah fucking seems like the
earth really is the center of the
universe right
and then beyond uh research beyond the
real research beyond a reasonable doubt
research in fucking bible times are you
fucking kidding me
it's a fucking dark ages nobody did any
fucking research galileo did some
research you know got a shit
in trouble real quick so basically
you know people say well it used to be a
fact that the earth was around it was
not a fact
it wasn't even a fucking or sorry earth
oops flat earth slip up
don't tell nasa don't edit that out
scott i want that in
so so basically you know people think
the earth used to be the center of the
universe that it used to be a fact it
wasn't even a hypothesis
all right some people like copernicus
galileo etc
they were the first people to even name
that a hypothesis
it got a lot of people in trouble for
even calling that hypothesis
how dare you right it was a fucking
notion
right so a lot of times people think
facts get overturned facts rarely get
over it happens it happens
but it's very rare which is why we can
be very confident in facts which is when
you know something is a fact
you can use it as a pretty stable base
of operations
for inferring other things and finally
getting an understanding of some shit to
be able to have actions remember from
earlier
that result in predictable consequences
and make your life better in whichever
way you want
lastly theory theory
oh my god i could do a whole fucking
video i'm not going to take up this
whole video to rant about the shit
theory is defined as an interconnected
framework
of facts that allow or allows for
strong hypothesis generation and thus
prediction of future events
slash relationships okay a theory
is something that has shitloads of facts
connected to each other
painting a grand architecture that makes
very very good sense at every way you
look at it
gravitation is a theory there are a
bunch of facts about how gravity works
the degrees of acceleration the masses
of bodies
so on and so forth all of them are facts
because they're fucking confirmed by all
this stuff
and they all make sense in light of each
other and they're basically never
violated
so gravitation is a series of
interconnected framework of facts
that allow for a really strong
hypothesis generation here you go
how heavy you're going to feel on
jupiter like if they you know jupiter's
gaseous uh gaseous planet so if they
give you a fucking platform
or some shit to the core and you stood
on the platform how heavy would you feel
on jupiter
well we know the mass of the planet
right we can predict
exactly how you're gonna fucking feel
right it gives us a
really good hypothesis generation like
imagine if gravity wasn't a theory
it was a notion and someone was like hey
we're gonna we have the technology to
visit other planets and they're about to
land on this fucking planet that's like
four times the mass of the earth
and someone's like how heavy am i going
to feel on there they'll be like i don't
know
you know your guess is as good as ours
no well luckily gravity is a fucking
theory so it really allows
for really strong predictions here's
another one evolution
is a theory of evolution and i'll get to
this in a second it's not a guess
okay is it a highly interconnected
framework of all supporting facts
we have the genomic record we have the
fossil record we have the geological
record
we have microevolution demonstrated in
laboratories
we have macroevolution demonstrated
again through all the fossil record
genomics and everything like that
all right all that taken together fuck
that's a whole lot of facts
and they allow us to make predictions
that are consistently true right
evolutionary biologists make a bunch of
predictions about
how you know you tell evolutionary
biologists and evolutionist psychologist
uh you tell them the difference between
uh in sizes of male and female in a
species they've ever seen
you tell them about sort of how rare
food is or how plentiful enemies are so
on and so forth
and they can give you predictable
behaviors that are very likely to occur
how the fuck are they doing that because
they have
a theory that allows them so many facts
we really start to see the landscape
really well
when you see a landscape well someone's
like hey point to the trees you're like
well there they are because we know
where the fuck they are that's how the
shit works right
here's the thing 97 times or whatever
fuck i said out of 100
people say i have a theory stop shut up
you don't have a theory okay one person
doesn't make up a theory
one person can make up sorry to throw in
this term a model
which is potentially a way to link facts
that makes sense right that's kind of
like
uh sort of somewhere between it's like a
hypothesis version
of a theory okay hypothesis is a fact as
modelist a theory
sort of but that's like takes teams of
scientists and
maybe one can do it but that sure as
hell isn't a theory all right and you're
not a fucking scientist you're some
fucking random dude
saying some bullshit right not you but
the person is telling you this kind of
shit
so people say you know i have a theory
you do not have an interconnected
framework of facts
that allows for strong hypothesis
generation that's not what you have all
95 times out of 100 when someone says i
have a theory
they have a notion two percent of the
time
they have a hypothesis which is like
really like man
and if somebody really you're like i
have a theory that if we manipulate
volume and intensity relationships in
the following way we're gonna get the
following like holy shit that's a real
hypothesis
they're the man right usually they're
like i have a theory
that if you lift big weights you get
huge you're like
boy i wish i knew what you meant by big
weights or
huge rate or get and what's the time
scale who the fuck knows it's not even a
hypothesis
it's literally a notion right it's a
fucking guess
the only difference between that kind of
notion and the usual kind as usual kinds
like this happens
when someone says i have a theory
they're at least having enough humility
uh to to call their shit a guess okay so
usually when someone says i have a
theory it's like a really poorly
educated guess
theories are not guesses theories are
built on a foundation of facts
theories are more fucking factual than
facts are because they connect multiple
facts
really really super important to
understand so
folks when you're talking if you want to
be a
super scientific about shit use these
terms use them well
right don't just throw around the term
fact very few facts out there very
rarefied error
don't just throw theory around i it's
great to use the term hypothesis all the
time
and uh call out notions when you see
them you don't have to tell people
that's a notion but in your own mind
you're like that's a notion
that's a notion that's a notion so now
that we have
this architecture here this
understanding we can start to see okay
notions are bullshit they're nice it's
maybe like if you need to make a
decision super fast you can go on
notions but
not scientifically you shouldn't do that
so how do we get to theories because
well ideally everything is a theory
everything is explained by grand theory
and we can predict everything that's
going to happen and we're fucking all
powerful and all wise and
science wins right so how do we get to
that or some increasing semblance of
that
well you know we got to get the facts
first because in fact so we have collect
facts and we order them together and
then they become theories
how do we get to fact hypotheses right
all facts start out as hypotheses first
and after getting vetted like fucking
crazy they might get anointed
or appointed to be facts so
super important to generate hypotheses
right
so next slide how do we generate a
precise hypothesis
the thing is it's not very easy as we've
already seen
the nature of a hypothesis has to be
tested
and for something to be tested
scientifically and tested well
we have to find out what exactly we're
claiming
okay let's go through a couple of
notions
and try to clean them up as best as we
can to turn them into hypotheses a
couple of
examples here number one a claim
i can beat you up right people usually
say meaner things like yo
i can kick your fucking ass right so
i can beat you up when people say that
what exactly does that mean
does that mean in an altercation at a
bar or a club
the next question is am i allowed to use
a chair or a broken beer bottle
like because usually someone says you i
can fucking kick your ass and you're
like oh is that right and you fucking
take a chair and pick it up they're like
yo what the fuck are you doing you
fucking crazy asshole
like oh oh you implied that there's
going to be a rule system
what's the rule system right there's
like a really good wrestler
can beat up most people unless the rule
system is the guy has a knife
right or you know if the rule system is
you're allowed to strike or you're not
allowed to strike so i can beat you up
is you know maybe the most formal way to
postulate that
is i can defeat you by a judge's
decision or tko
in a sanctioned mixed martial arts match
most people don't say that when they say
i can beat you up but if you're if you
really like you're getting some beef
with someone you're like yo i can kick
your ass and they're like no you fucking
can't you're like
all right let's enroll into an amateur
mma fight
have it be sanctioned or go to an mma
gym and have the expert people there you
will pay him a hundred bucks
and they'll like ref the fight for us
we'll sign the waivers
and they'll make sure it's all rules and
everything's followed and we'll actually
decide in a formal systematic manner who
can actually kick whose ass
pretty precise claim uh another one you
know there's always
i can beat you up with what weapons you
know like you talk shit to the wrong guy
he used to be navy seal
i don't give a shit how much fucking
fighting you know you're gonna die
before you ever get to the guy
right so i can beat you up pretty
interesting claim seems really
straightforward
and it's pretty close it's one of the
more straightforward ones that we're
going to examine
but even still you have to be very
precise once you say i can defeat you in
formal next martial arts competition
under the standard ufc rule set man that
is a hypothesis
right and that can be tested right every
time you watch ufc
or you watch bellator and you see a
fight happening that is literally a
hypothesis test
when people bet on one fighter versus
another they're literally just
hypothesis testing
i believe that your my guy can beat you
up under the following set of very
precise conditions really sweet really
awesome right
you used to be a notion now it's a
hypothesis here's the next one
strong men are stronger than power
lifters you see this kind of dumb ass
shit debated all the fucking time on
instagram is who's stronger like
world's best powerlifter or a strong man
well what do you mean by strong
and someone's going to be like what do
you mean fucking everyone who's strong
does everyone really know strong
right when a guy does a 1rm with 500
pounds
and another guy does a 10rm with 4.95
who's stronger the fuck 495 guy
why he lifted less weight yeah but he
did 10 with it
so how do you compare the two you
probably should put the same
weight on the bar and then here's
another question if you have the same
weight on the bar
one guy does it once one guy does it
three times can you say the guy that did
it three times is stronger
well strength is defined as the skill of
applying force to an object and is
usually defined as maximal force
so when one guy benches 500 for a single
and the other guy benches it for a
double
the maximum force was pretty much the
same right it's pretty pretty identical
the load is the same
and for all intents purposes is the same
force i'll give a shit how many reps you
fucking did it with
uh do the same strength so then you're
like okay
i guess the way we're really going to
find out if people are stronger is
if we specify that your maximum lift has
to be harder or heavier
now we're getting somewhere so it's got
to be a one repetition max
or hey shit a five or five rep max but
both guys have to do five reps then we
compare the load because you know we're
not comparing reps here that's not what
strength is
and then going we ask the next question
what's the lift going to be
you guys ever like walk into a gas
station and start chatting up with a
clerk and they're like
you're pretty big how much do you lift
and you're like what do you mean lift
like there's like the bench press squat
deadlift clean
jerk stone loading i don't fucking know
what you want like you know usually
you just say like you know usually they
want a no bench or if they're like an
old lady or something you just give them
your deadlift because it's the most
impressive and they're like oh my god
you're a superhero like i'm a super
villain bitch
and you get all the fucking groceries
you don't pay for the shit you run off
where am i anyway so we have to specify
the lift or series of lifts
power lifting is a pretty good start
right because you've got a squat bench
deadlifts multiple angles multiple
muscle groups
very formal rule set what about strong
men
well you can compare strength and strong
men but sometimes you know the
competition implements that are picked
the events
just might not favor one guy over
another right like you got a guy who's
just not technical with stone loading
and he can deadlift a shitload more than
the other guy he can bent row a shitload
more
he can press a shitload more he can
squat more but the other guy just
knows stone loading technique super fast
or super super well
and he beats him on stones is the guy
who beat him on stone stronger
maybe if you've defined strength as the
ability to lift stones
which is an interesting way to define
strength it's not wrong
necessarily but good luck convincing
people of that right
so when people say strongmen are
stronger than powerlifters what i'm
getting at is
you're going to have to really define
what strength is and get people
strong men who are arguing for
themselves powerlifters argue for
themselves to get some
some overlap here that's okay this is
how we're really going to test it and
they potentially could
right they could say okay let's do we do
overhead press a strong man you guys do
as power lifters bench press
let's do a best five rep max uh
incline barbell press and that's gonna
be strong today
okay cool that's a good start and
there's more comprehensive there's
better ways
but look as we get to that hypothesis
remember strongmen are stronger than
powerlifters
notion strong men have higher five
repetition maximums in the inclined
barbell press
when tested under formal conditions
versus power lifters that is a
hypothesis
right and if we're really it's
interesting because once we start making
hypotheses we realize each hypothesis
is just a tiny sliver of knowledge so if
you want an expansive hypothesis
you're going to have to say like not
only are we testing incline barbell
press
we're testing the upright row we're
testing the weighted pull up we're
testing the bent row we're testing the
squat
we're testing the good morning or
something hamstring strength
and then you can really say like we've
tested 90 of the muscles of the body
in major compound non not super
technical movements that everyone
knows and we've tested them on maximum
strength to really see who's stronger
now
that's a good experiment very hard
that's very precise hypothesis they get
you a very precise very good answer
but if you just say yo they're stronger
and you're like well why they're like
because
because strong men can do more stone
loading or like all right that's
again a notion right next one next
example last example
broccoli is healthier than ice cream
it's a hypothesis it's a fine idea and
it's mostly true but not always true
here's an example in the context of the
average
overweight westerner right some fucking
cocksucker from denmark or
canada or the united states uh is he
better off replacing
half of his ice cream consumption with
broccoli consumption
yeah fuck yeah he's gonna lose weight
and more micronutrients
it's all great by every indices of
health he's gonna be better off
now what about a person who is anorexic
and incredibly underweight
what about a person from a country with
starvation
like they finally get that person out of
starvation can you imagine adopting a
child out of a starving country a job to
adopt a child
from the sudan amazing what a great
thing you did and you sit them down at
the dinner table and you're like you
know hello
you know we're in your new family are
you hungry and they're like uh-huh
and you're like okay here's a plate of
broccoli they're gonna be like what the
fuck like can you send me the fuck back
to the sudan
like he's just kidding me right you give
him ice cream and they're like fuck
calories carbs and it's literally by
blood measurements of health going to
make them healthier
to eat ice cream for like weeks on end
until they renormalize to a normal
weight they stop running out of like
literal fats to
construct their brain tissue all right
so broccoli is healthier than ice cream
how do we turn that into a hypothesis
that actually has merit beyond an ocean
we say broccoli is healthier than ice
cream
in the context of replacing some
fraction of ice cream in the modern
average western diet
in a mostly overweight individual now
that's a hell of a hypothesis
and you can do a study you can take
people and have them live in a community
or a ward
and you can give the 50 of them the same
amount of ice cream they always ate and
50 of them you trade off their ice cream
to the broccoli that's a shitty fucking
group to get into by accident
hey you in the ice cream brook the
broccoli group like i don't want to talk
about it
i gotta eat broccoli later right then
you know you get a very clear result
you're like yeah clearly for these
people broccoli is better
but not guaranteed not guaranteed so
again if we want to generate hypotheses
we have to generate very very precise
guesses at what's going on and then
tested them
all right getting on to testing them so
hypothesis testing which is most of
science
turns out it's not as simple as it could
be
one of the big reasons is confounders
confounders are the reason we need these
very elaborate study designs
because confounders basically make it
that
what you're seeing is not really what's
going on right so the definition
here is causes or effects that are not
the causes of effects we assume
are responsible for the interaction a
couple of examples
claim notion people today are less fit
because of television watching
seems seems tenable right television
watching has been increasing for a long
time especially through like the 70s 80s
90s
and obesity has increased during that
same time and fitness
average fitness has declined i say oh
that's yeah
tv definitely right but hold on a second
what about fast food what about fast
food consumption
fast food consumption you know tv like
you watch more tv then you become more
sedentary
and then you gain weight and you burn
less fit well you know plausible
certainly something to it um but what
about
a more direct link of like you're just
eating more fucking tasty high fat high
carb food
fast food and it's super addictive sort
of i don't like to use that term
formally it's super
like rewarding so you want more of it
you eat more fast food you gain a little
weight you become less fit
uh that seems at least as powerful
potentially of a mechanism
as does uh the idea of tv watching
right and the thing is like there's some
good research to show that people
even who are sedentary actually burn
quite a few calories relative to their
body weight and
doing much more exercise definitely
burns more calories maybe not as many as
we'd expect so there's some reason to
believe that
just sedentary behavior probably doesn't
make you fat but sedentary behavior
plus excess eating almost certainly
makes you fat so
if we just say people today are less fit
because of tv watching
right that's a fine hypothesis but if
you were on like uh you know uh what was
that fucking show back in the day
um who want to be a millionaire the
millionaire show scott fucks that show
called
who wants to be a millionaire right
regis philbin the man
right if you're on who wants to be a
millionaire and you're answering the
million dollar question
in in his options right and it's like
how did americans what is the largest
explanatory factor
for the reduction of fitness in
americans from 1970 to 2000
and one of them is americans are
watching more tv but one of them is
they're eating more fast food are you
really just gonna pick the tv one
no you're gonna be like oh fuck i had to
phone a friend i got a phone doctor mike
you call me i'm like i don't fucking
know
right just guess right so there's an
example of a potential con founder
because and here's here's how bad
confounders really are
who are the people that watch the most
tv they're the same fucking people that
eat the most fast food
so it's really hard to tangle apart
right so there's another cause could be
responsible
right confounders get even trippier than
that let's look at another one
notion i got stronger because i trained
my arms more
like my arms got stronger uh because or
sorry like
uh my bench press got stronger because i
trained uh my arms more
okay interesting uh i guess sort of
hypothesis notion
well potentially here's what happened
yes it's totally possible you train your
arms more your triceps got stronger
your chest didn't get any stronger and
all of a sudden you're benching more but
here's the thing
what if you had been chronically
overdoing it for your chest
you train your chest let's say your
chest and technical terms was
exceeding its maximum recoverable volume
too often
and you started training your arms more
so you were like ah yeah
i can't just be in the gym for four
hours so i'm gonna train my chest less
you train your chest less and it puts it
back in between minimum effective volume
and maximum recoverable right in that
sweet spot
between the two somewhere and all of a
sudden you're making fucking awesome
chest gains your chest gets stronger
right so it's actually the opposite
cause of what we thought
right you'd be like hey why'd your bench
press get stronger like fucking train my
triceps more wrong you train your chest
less
that's why and when they train their
triceps more they might have hit close
to mrv so much that the triceps just
plateaued
right so i got my fucking my back butt
up because i train my triceps more
false it's literally the opposite of
that it's because you trained your chest
less
but fuck you know you started training
your arms more and then your bench got
stronger so what are you supposed to
fucking conclude
well that's the thing is if it's a
serious hypothesis it requires much more
in-depth analysis
than just anecdotal evidence which is
what you have remember it's got to mean
anecdote
practical experience and formal research
blah blah blah all that stuff has to be
checked off it's not a fact
it's not even a hypothesis yet all right
so hypothesis generation
tough because there's confounders around
we got to figure out what's really going
on we might have to look a little deeper
and
really get to formal research last one
you got a new relaxation pillow the
relaxer 5000
stay calm it doesn't do anything sexual
though that would be very sweet right
relaxation pillow and you you got it you
fucking bought it for like 200
on amazon you sort of felt ripped off
but you're trying to justify it yourself
you know what it fucking helps me
recover bro i sleep better i fucking get
better rest everything's going great it
fucking works
well it could just be a placebo effect
right very very well established the
fact that when you believe something to
be true
if it's something your brain has a power
to change in your body or in your
actions
it could just be your brain changing it
like uh one of the best ways to recover
is uh to really actually
relax how do you relax well if you
believe that you were being relaxed by
something you were much more likely to
be like
and all of a sudden you do that you fall
asleep better you sleep better and you
recover faster
because you believe you're getting a
fucking recovery specialty with this
pillow
but that's actually not doing shit
interestingly enough
uh don't want to spoil any other
lectures in the rpu
massage its effects on recovery work
pretty much like that
it's nice to have someone touching you
and it's super calming
because it's calming it's all the other
effects it's kind of muscle shit
like fucking you're working on your
knots or some shit the fuck that is what
the fuck is a muscle knot
and by the way there's a good question
for you muscles don't tie themselves in
knots that's
fucking insane but neither here nor
there you get a relaxation pillow you
think it's helping you because of its
magical relaxation powers or what's got
like perforated holes to drain away your
asses or some shit
bullshit turns out it's a placebo so we
can't assume
that relationships that seem true are
true
we have to test them more formally we
need a way
to link cause and effect and in order to
do that
we have to obviate we have to push away
all the confounders to see reality
how the hell do we do that well we do it
by study design
the entire purpose of scientific studies
is to take confounders take causes take
effect
and try to remove as many confounders as
possible like if you have like
a cutting board you got to get rid of
all the garbage and see
what is actually causing what right and
for studies to be good we have to
consider
a couple of things first internal
validity is the way the study structured
actually allowing the study to conclude
what it does we'll talk about internal
validity
in just a bit second is external
validity let's even say the study
concludes that it concludes
how useful is that for us to apply to a
normal population
quick example we learned that a certain
kind of dribbling
makes it less likely that you get the
ball stolen from you but the test was
done
in 8th grader can we say that we're
going to recommend this to nba
athletes i don't know i sure like to see
it work in nba athletes first
eighth graders don't have that kind of
reach they'll have that kind of
athleticism
and that dribbling thing might have been
something the eighth graders are new to
but people in high school try and it
doesn't work because people figure out
their game so by the time you get to the
nba
nobody does that shit right that's like
trying like a basic jiu jitsu 101 arm
bar
on a world champion grappler he's gonna
be like really you don't think i've seen
this a million times
like damn it what arm bars work against
untrained opponents
like yeah sure we can even have a study
that says that but it's not externally
valid to world champions
other things might work better at that
point another thing to consider
there are essentially two types of
studies we can do in science there's
there's way more gradations we can split
them up
there's two big ones there are
observational studies where we don't
change anything
we just look at stuff like we look up
the cdc's report on diet and disease
and we know they they talk to 10 000
people they ask them a shitload of
questions about how they're eating
and they measured a shitload of things
about their disease rates for like 20
years
did they tell them how to eat no did
they make them sick on purpose i sure
hope not i don't know man the
government's making us look
sick but putting fluoride in our water
or whatever right
so none of that happened nobody
interfered with anything they just
collected data and they're just looking
at it
the thing is observational studies don't
let us infer
true causation they can give us really
good hypotheses
they can generally get hypotheses but
you can't do causation because you
didn't actually manipulate anything and
see
if i put this in does it work if i take
it out does it not work right
but correlations are pretty good and
they're a really good start
interventional studies we actually
intervene
like you give mice sucralose and then
you give other mice not sucralose
and then you see how the effect goes and
then you switch the groups
and you give the other mice not
sucralose and you give these my
sucralose and you see
okay do they get more cancer or
something you're actually changing
something which
formally allows you to make a good guess
at causation like this is
actually causing that there's plenty of
room for both kinds of studies
observational studies tend to be more
externally valid you know interventional
studies
tend to be more internally valid right
and we're going to talk about later
there's might be a little bit of a
trade-off between the two both have
their place
we just need to know how how much we can
conclude from both
right all right let's get into the
depths of stuff
with internal validity okay
there are a couple of concerns with
internal validity we're going to go
through each one the first one is
setting up controls what is the purpose
of
what the hell are controls and what the
purpose of setting up well basically
you want to make sure that the effect
you think you see
is the effect you're actually seeing
okay that's called controlled conditions
it's the quieting down of everything
else
to make sure we're actually seeing what
we want um we'll talk about
observational studies later on something
called covariates
this is for interventional studies right
generally speaking there's got to be a
way for us to think okay
when we make a change how do we know it
wasn't just by chance that we saw the
effect for example
you take lifters you measure their quads
you have them do squats you measure
their quads later
and their quads grew what if they were
like 13 year olds their quads were
growing anyway
what if the quads would grow just as
well from leg pressing so what the hell
are you concluding anyway
who the fuck knows right there was no
way for you to control the conditions
enough
to make sure that okay we're going to
test this and we're going to test not
this
to make sure that when this is here and
it's not here it's
the effect we're looking for is not
happening when when our proposed cause
is around
right like if you're saying something
causes something else when the cause
isn't around you better not fucking see
that something else
right if you on purpose take it away
there better not because if it just
happens anyway how the fuck you know
that your shit is even causing it right
so uh there's a couple of ways to do
that one thing you can have
is what's called a control group it's
the most straightforward way it has its
upsides and downsides
easiest way to understand this the
control group there's two groups
treatment group and control group
treatment group gets the shit you think
causes something
and remember your measuring effect in
both groups and the control group gets
nothing right or some version of nothing
so
uh you feed one group of rats you're
trying to see if
sucralose fake sugar right artificial
sweetener causes cancer
you feed one group of rats the
experimental group the treatment group
you feed them sucralose
the other rats you feed just regular
diet there's no sucralose just regular
fucking sugar
same old shit right so the regular diet
rats somebody could say
be like hey what do what are these rats
eating like they visit your lab and
they're like whoa
cool science what are those rats eating
and you're like well they're eating
sucralose we're testing to see if it
causes cancer yeah
and they're like what about those rats
what are they eating and they're like oh
no they just eat a normal diet they'd be
like that's stupid
why ha well here's why because if we
have measure the effect at the end and
both rats get cancer at the same rates
well clearly the sucralose isn't
probably fucking not causing cancer
because how the fuck do both rats have
the same cancer rates
sometimes they see like the normal
eating rats have more cancer you're like
okay well clearly sucralose is just not
responsible for shit right
so a control group really allows you to
see if there's no
cause that we want to see present does
the effect still happen or does it
happen less or more
now there's another way to do it two
treatment groups
so you could say okay what grows quads
more
squats or not squats who the fuck does
not squats for getting big that's kind
of stupid way to compare
things like of course squats are going
to grow your legs more than not
squatting
or training at all that's a stupid
control group so in exercise and sports
science
a lot of times you'll have two treatment
groups that compare two different things
two relevant things
so the hypothesis is squats grow your
legs more
your quads more than leg presses ah now
you have two groups
a squatting group and a leg pressing
group one group squats one glute
leg presses four months later we see how
much change in muscle size there was two
treatment groups is cool
for a variety of reasons and one of them
is it's way more easy to apply to the
real world
right especially if you pick your
treatments properly and then
lastly a really interesting way to do
things difficult because it takes more
time it's not always applicable
but a crossover design crossover design
is super cool
the simplest way to do it is you do
let's say a
uh this is really exotic an eight month
study
and quad hypertrophy you've got
dedicated subjects
and the groups start out with just like
in the last study
four months of leg press four months of
squat but then after the next four
months you flip the groups
so the people that used to leg press for
four months they're squatting for for
the next four months
the people that used to squat their leg
pressing now and you measure
the quad size before the study starts
right at the four month mark in the
middle
and then right at the end so if you see
that when the groups that were squatting
no matter who was squatting after squats
they did better than leg presses and
squad size
fuck man looks like anyone you apply
squats to whether in this group that
group
doesn't matter they fucking get bigger
you got you're on to something
but if the both of the groups grew more
in the second half of the study than the
first
it doesn't matter squats or leg presses
you're like i don't know
we really can't conclude much of
anything because if leg presses really
were a fucking thing
or sorry if squats really did grow more
than leg presses you'd expect to see
because
any time we put in squats and take out
leg presses we see better growth
if that's true we're on to something for
sure right
main point here and there's many other
ways of doing this but the main point
here is you can't just apply a treatment
and then measure the effect you can't
say okay this is the cause i think
this is the effect oh sweet we got the
effect right if you did that
you'd be like okay well you know i think
the cause
of you know uh shark attacks is ice
cream consumption
and then you would go you know to see
where ice cream can
consume the most and uh it turns out
shark attacks have on a shitload because
ice cream is consumed on beaches during
the summer and you're like i fucking
knew it the sharks love the ice cream
they can detect your carbohydrate levels
through the fucking ocean and they come
out and they're actually after the ice
cream it just happens to be inside you
already and then they're just going
after well that's ridiculous right
we never actually applied a different
treatment and saw well let's go to a
place where people really don't eat ice
cream and apparently there's like you
know
some beaches in australia where ice
cream is just not really sold and the
surfers they don't need ice cream anyway
what's the rate of shock attacks it's
like a fucking trillion
you know per hour or whatever like crazy
australian shark attack rates you're
like huh
no ice cream but still shark attacks
okay back to square one so you can't
just and this is even that was an
observational example
i'm like spacing on how you even design
a study that didn't like
uh have a group squat and then and then
measure hypertrophy pre and post and say
squats are great for hypertrophy
compared to what right that's not a
statement that carries a lot of validity
and it might not even be true that
squats are great fibery
because how do you know if they did
nothing they would
uh grow quads more for example you could
take teenagers
and do an endurance running program with
them for two months and they'll grow
legs between a and b
but the thing is that the teenagers that
didn't even do the insurance running
during that time just for maturation
they grew legs even bigger so you could
say well see endurance running in
teenagers increases leg size bullshit it
actually attenuates leg size
uh you just never measured a control
group so super super important
without proper controls i'll tell you
what right out of the gate if you ever
read a study
it has improper controls garbage because
we can include shit
right next study blinding what does
blinding mean it literally means
everyone wrote the study gets blinded
after like the taj mahal engineer so
they can never replicate it again just
kidding that'd be super fucked up all
right
so blinding occurs on a spectrum
from meh to better to best
you can't always have the best because
some research settings just
aren't conducive to the best kind of
study blinding
but based on how the study is blinded
and how it's conducted
you can rate it remember your rating
studies on how good they are it's not a
zero or one rating it's like a one to
ten scale
the best studies the tens are all best
blinded we'll talk about that means in a
second
but if you have a blinded study that
does a lot of other good things you can
still conclude something from it
so what is matte blinding okay the
subjects know what the study
is testing and so do the people
administering the test
imagine a psychologist administering an
iq test to you test of intelligence
and it's like you show up and they're
like here's 50 bucks
if you complete this test and you're
like sweet what's the test like it's
your intelligence test and you're like
okay
so the researcher knows it the subject
knows it
eh you know there's no blinding everyone
knows what's going on right so
potentially there could be some
confounding there
um thing is for some things like
intelligence that's actually okay
if you know it's an intelligence test or
not it doesn't fucking matter because
you just got to take a shot at the title
right if someone knows it's an
intelligence test there's no way for
them to gain the system or some shit
these are some questions you have to
answer either right or wrong
and a psychologist knowing his
administering intelligence test or not
doesn't really seem to bias people in
one way or another like
he's sitting there all expecting her
shit and he's just sitting there
normally he's done a trillion times
right
so if the subjects know what the study
is testing
you know that that's definitely uh
potentially not a great thing in some
contexts but sometimes it's okay
right if you're measuring abilities it's
usually okay
uh if you're measuring things that are
subject to the placebo effect
real bad here here's an example give
someone
a pill that's supposed to reduce their
pain
and let's say their subjects are
experiencing some chronic pain
and you just give them a pain pill and
the researcher is like here's a pain
pill
and the guy's like what does it do like
it reduces your pain
and they take it and we just monitor for
three hours like every 30 minutes we ask
them how much pain they're in
placebo effect they're going to be like
yeah i think i think it's working yeah
for sure
but if we just gave him a pill and
they're like what's this for and we're
like um
you know it's actually just a test pill
we're not even sure what it does but
we're gonna give you a bunch of
questions and some of them are pain
questions but they didn't even know it
was a pain study so they just honestly
rated them and it turns out the pill
doesn't do shit or the pill is effective
and they're like ah actually
less pain i don't know what the fuck has
to do with anything but i honestly don't
feel as much pain as normal
right so that's in the better category
so better is subjects don't know what
the study is testing
or they think it's something else right
the something else thing is fucking
hilarious because
uh people don't show up to psychological
experiments often and just let you test
them for shits and giggles when they
don't even know what it's about
so what they do sometimes here's a
really classic example
uh this is really the institutional
review application for this must have
been pretty extensive
they were measuring anger responses in
college age students and how people
sociologically deal with the expression
of anger
and i believe it was multiple groups of
students they were testing and i think
students from like i'm misremembering
the study but i think students from like
the east coast
uh seem to be uh deal with anger a
little bit different than students from
the midwest for example
so what they did was they invited
students into a psychological evaluation
and they said like oh you're going to
take a test and it's about like visual
spatial learning or some shit people
don't even
know whatever the fuck that is so you
will connect some dots and stuff
on their way into the test they had
an accidentally another researcher bump
into the person right while they were
walking and the researcher was
instructed to be cold about it
so the researcher every single subject
that came in because they came in one at
a time
the researcher walked through the same
hallway and they had video cameras and
everything
unbeknownst to them and he would bump
into them and be like
watch where you're going and just kind
of have like some papers you know
brainiac like
watch where you're going and he kept
going and the way people
responded to that was being monitored i
didn't fucking know that was the case
so did they give honest answers yeah
fuck yeah because what you're gonna ask
people that like hey this is a study
about how you respond to people
trying to get you angry all right or
this guy's going to bump into you let us
know how you feel
of course you're going to put your best
foot forward and be like oh wait i'm
totally cool don't worry as a researcher
but when you don't know what the fuck's
going on you think you're there for
another reason
you're single-blinded by subject-only
blinding because the researcher knows
what he's doing
right you're much more likely to be very
honest about what's going on so it's
fine i think that
people i misremember the people from the
east coast or no
it was uh southern students i believe
were more likely
to be like yo what the fuck is your
problem whereas i think northern
students
don't quote me on this we're like oh my
mistake or something like that and they
were more likely to like internalize it
and sort of just blame themselves
i was in that study your boy stabbed
somebody after that shit the fuck out of
my face
i wish i wish i was that tough all right
lastly
the best kinds of study designs again
not always practical but our sort of
gold standard is double blinding
subjects and study personnel both out of
the loop how the fuck does that work
well here's the deal
you give subjects a study on creatine
you want to see if creatine makes them
more jacked
so you measure their jackets you know
month one month six or some shit like
that
and they take creatine every day except
when they come over to pick up the
creatine from you
you know you like give them a new
creatine uh like stash every couple
weeks
uh they're like so this is creatine
right and you tell everyone it's
creatine
but half of the subjects get just like
powder like fucking powdered sugar or
some shit
or something that looks and feels and
tastes exactly creatine but just
fucking isn't all right it's basically
inert like like maltodextrin or
something
so you're lying to people they sign the
waiver right so
no big deal but they literally just
you're telling everyone it's creatine
or you're telling everyone it's
something totally different so they're
completely blinded they don't know what
the fuck it is
because if everyone's assuming it's
creatine you get the same placebo effect
from everyone
but if the real creatine group does
better you can be like well clearly they
all thought it was the same shit they
just you know
obviously it's the creation itself how
do you blind the personnel okay
why do you need to blind the personnel
because here's what can happen
you get a graduate student in charge of
dispensing the creatine and the
uh the maltodextrin the fake creatine
you know if they're not blinded
they know which one's which okay and
they can either give conscious or
subconscious cues
to the person that's real or not right
so conscious cues are like hey
here's your creatine it's not really
creatine
right that sucks because they're like oh
sweet they don't even train as hard
because it's bullshit they're giving me
fake supplements
and then they rate later like my
workouts aren't going that great and
because they don't try they don't grow
as much
shit we don't know what's going on but
there's also unconscious clues
like if you tell someone like hey you
know this is the real creatine but don't
make it look like it they're going to be
like excessively nervous like oh here's
your definitely your creatine
monohydrate that's almost 100 percent
creature monitor for sure
it's definitely not um it's not melted
extreme i'll tell you that
right you're like that sucks they
probably think you're lying now right
solution the graduate students don't
know what the fuck they're giving out
the researchers in the back room whoever
get to be in effect in this interaction
they portion out all the stuff they know
which boxes are which which little
baggies of creatine look at that your
college campus sling and baggies of
powder just like underground again
and uh you know they know what they're
giving out but the people actually
giving them out the master students they
don't know what the fuck was what
so the you know because like people like
know each other right the master
students sometimes teach the undergrads
that are in the study
the undergrad would be like picking up
be like hey so this is a real creatine
or not and the master system is like
actually i have no fucking clue i
literally just don't know they're like
fuck
so they just have to lift and try as
normal or the average cancels out and
then you actually find out if creatine
works or not
in supplement studies double blinding is
really fucking important
in a bunch of psychological studies
double blinding is super important
in training studies no blinding
is oftentimes okay like you take two
groups of people
and you're like this is a study designed
to see which exercises get you more
jacked you're in the squats group
there's other people doing leg presses
lift most students are like i don't
fucking know each other i don't care
just i'll just do what you say and we
measure muscle fractional synthetic
rates later and say okay you got more
jacked
right and also like you know if the
people testing it know what they're
testing
nine times out of ten they're still
going to yell at the squats and leg
press group just as
much to really pump them up so so that's
you know
not really a factor right single
blinding the subjects
you know don't know what the study is uh
that could be important in some other
cases
so basically ideally ideally almost
always have double blinding
but sometimes it's really not that big
of a deal if it's single blinding but
sometimes it is so you got to read the
study get the context and move forward
on your conclusions
all right internal validity next up
sample size this one's really
straightforward
the more subjects you have to test a
hypothesis with
the less the chance is of experiencing
chance events
for example you have one subject in each
group
one person has been training for six
years
another person for six months just oops
randomly
you give them the same program or you
slightly different program one guy who
gives leg presses one guy you give
squats
the guy who gets leg presses has only
been training for six months so he like
multiplies his quad size but like a
physically visible amount
the guy that's been training six years
you give him squats or leg presses or
something
and he barely gets any hypertrophy at
all that's noticeable in like six weeks
because jesus christ like you've been
lifting for six years you're not gonna
grow that much that fast
so you conclude well clearly the person
who got the leg presses grew more so leg
presses work better well that's fucking
ridiculous a sample size of two are you
kidding me it could all be chance
it could just be like those people are
just very different people how do you
reduce that well you know a sample size
of 10 in each group
you know now we start to get more of a
normal distribution in each group
especially if you randomize
the people in each group like you people
won't just come in and they're like i
want to do squats or i want to do leg
press
you literally just get 20 people
together you do random number generator
that puts them either in squats like
press squats like press squats leg press
and you just totally there's
you know they're basically random now
here's the thing you can try to assign
randomness
but you can still get groups that are
they're different and there's not much
to do about that you can try to make
them a little bit more similar by
scaling them to strength
but there's stuff you could be missing
and you never quite know what
confounders are floating around
here's the thing the sample size of 100
in each group
and you randomize it geez i mean it's
very unlikely that a couple aberrant
people here and they're going to really
skew the results that
much so all of a sudden if your sample
size is really big you can really
conclude some stuff and you can allow
for the detection
of smaller differences right if someone
improves by two percent
in a sample size of two people the way
statistics work
you basically can't tell if it's due to
chance but the more people you have
testing something
the finer tune you can say okay wow you
know this gives you
one percent more hypertrophy but because
it was 1500 people in each group
we can actually say that's a pretty
reliable difference
right that is a meaningful difference it
actually happened it was probably not
due to chance
but if you got two cocksuckers and one
got one and a half percent stronger than
the other
you know it could have been 50 stronger
doesn't matter still probably due to
chance
right so the sample size generally the
rule is the more the merrier
some exceptions to that very few um so
when you look at university studies and
you're like man this study sucks how
come they only had like five people in
each group
uh it's hard to recruit people and
money's not infinite like you you do a
study that
includes functional uh you know imaging
you have like an mri study for muscle
growth
mris are like a grand pop like it's like
a thousand dollars to run the machine
once
oh you're fucking you made money you got
a 500 subjects in each group what the
fuck is this like you know
like we're not like some fucking you
know infinite money generating country
we're just like yeah we're just spending
millions of dollars on just bodybuilding
science
that's not happening right so a lot of
times sample size the number one concern
is study complexity like jesus we have
to get through 500 training subjects
you're not going to train 500 people in
a lab
right and also just money and resources
like it's just not uh not realistic so
usually sample size is like people will
get as big of a sample size as they can
to be able to get enough precision to
detect the effects they want to see
so if they're expecting that quad growth
usually happens at like you know
two pounds of quad growth is something
that like if they detect they can say
okay that's a reasonable difference
you get enough subject to where you can
detect like half pound differences
so if you get a two pound difference
because half pound is already good so
four times that that's definitely not
due to a chance
that's an example there more than merry
or sample size
next your investigation tools including
statistical tools for internal validity
have to be good and proper that's two
different things
first of all tools have to be accurate
and precise enough
to get you what you want for example you
are trying to test
whether or not a new warm-up strategy
will give a slight boost to performance
but the force plate on which you're
measuring forces doesn't detect force
forces that are 10 pounds apart and it
turns out that reliably
when you warm people up with one
strategy versus another
they get nine pounds more force can you
guys imagine if you figured out a way
that you warm up your bench press
differently at a powerless you meet and
pretty much on average gets you nine
fucking pounds more on your bench you
fucking kidding me that's amazing
well if you test it on a force plate
that doesn't do anything lower than 10
pound increments
you never caught it you'd be like looks
like they're the same
oops right so you have to make sure that
your instruments are accurate and
precise to what you want to
actually measure right next
tools have to measure on the actually
like what you want to actually measure
they have to measure what we actually
need all right so for example
if you do a fiber biopsy which means you
take out
one muscle fiber potentially you section
it off and you look at the structure of
that fiber and you see if that fiber has
grown or has shrunk so on and so forth
that's cool that's a good way to measure
hypertrophy hypertrophy is
does the individual fiber shrink or grow
can we use that as a test of hyperplasia
what is hyperplasia
hyperplasia is the question of do muscle
fibers actually multiply
during the process of muscle growth like
used to have 600 muscle fibers and now
you have 1200
so you're fucking bigger right
hypertrophy is when you have 600 of the
same fibers but they're all two times
the size
right so if you're individually taking
out muscle biopsies and looking at one
fiber at a time how the fuck can you
tell about hyperplasia you can't
you literally have to take how do they
tell about hyperplasia in animals and
why there's zero hyperplasia studies in
humans here's how
you take the entire animal and you
basically take all of its everything off
you take all of its muscles off
you grind it through some shit and you
count exact protein weight
okay and you count the amount of nuclear
volume and you can potentially even take
an entire
mouse quadricep or this is really like
morbid
and you section it and you count every
single fucking fiber
right you counted the fibers all right
in in various mice
like so it's an average fiber number and
then you
one of the mice gets this crazy new
treatment and one of the mice just gets
a normal treatment of some kind like
some kind of super drug that causes
hyperplasia and then you fucking cut the
mice open afterwards when they're dead
and you literally count the number of
muscle fibers you say well holy shit
these mice have 20 more fibers and these
are randomized 100 mice per category
this is insane you run that study two or
three more times like dude this is
literally fucking causing hyperplasia
but you gotta count every fiber
so sometimes the tools people measure
are literally just not the tools
appropriate for the tasks
that's a big part of internal validity
right sometimes you'll start reading a
study and they're like
you know this increases intelligence and
you're like oh what intelligence test
did you use oh that's not an
intelligence test that's appropriate for
this task
bullshit wrong you just throw it away
right um after you get your results
the statistical tools are important so
for example
you can have data that's normally
distributed you can have data that's
distributed in another way like a
chi-square distribution
if you apply if you have chi-square
distributed data and you apply a
normally distributed
statistical uh procedure which basically
you assume a normal distribution
you can get just pure garbage right a
lot of those times
what you're looking for and even if you
don't know statistics
you're looking for a well-meaning
attempt to choose the proper statistics
for the task
and if you really don't know if it's
really important for you to find out if
a study is valid
what you can do if you're in the
research field yourself is maybe if
you're writing a paper or something
reach out to a statistician and be like
hey can you take a look at the study
stats that they use do you think the
stats are appropriate for what they want
and they could be like yeah this is
totally normal they could be like you
know what
i'll tell you what the test they're
using is a test intentionally designed
to try to open up the hypothesis a bit
more and be less rigorous i know for a
fact that's what they're doing
and it's clearly not it's there it is
basically they're using a test to get
them what they want instead of what they
should be getting
that's a good bullshit detector so
statistical tools have to be justified
usually you'll have a discussion section
uh where they'll tell you why they used
the statistical tools they did
um lastly uh for internal ooh not lastly
damn internal lindy's got a lot of shit
to it
um there's a difference between
significance
and effect size and it's a very very big
thing significance testing
right like a p value like when they say
you know creatine performs significantly
better
than beta alanine and increasing muscle
growth significantly means
statistics can give us a pretty high
likelihood that the effect is not just
due to chance
when something is significantly
different in science it means
it's probably actually different versus
like it just could be due to chance and
if we run the experiment another hundred
times
it could all be a wash so significant
means it's different for example here
here's a really easy illustration
when you have someone that is six foot
one
and someone else that is six foot one
and a quarter but using the best
measurements possible making sure their
feet are flat measuring them laying down
measuring them passed out when they're
laying down so they're not trying to
stretch out and cheat
every single one of those tests conclude
that the guy who's six one is shorter
than the guy who is six one and three
quarters that is a significant
difference
because we're pretty sure that guy's
actually taller
now effect size is the question of how
much
taller it's not the question of if it's
the question of okay
if got it he's taller but how much let
me ask you guys a question
if you're at the fucking bar or the club
and someone's like how tall are you are
you gonna say six one
and one quarter what fuck is wrong with
you like what are you eight
right like and so when you ask an
eight-year-old how old they are and
they're like i'm eight in in one quarter
years old like uh or i got it you're
eight
that's nice right so is it a
statistically mean
is is it if the effect size asks is it a
difference
that is meaningful is it meaningfully
large right
do you go into the nba because you're
six one and
one quarter versus six one no but if
you're six
six versus six one as far as basketball
performance on average is concerned
that is an effect size that is
meaningful and they actually have
ways for you to tell what your effect
size is and look up the number and it
falls into a category of like small
medium large very large effect size so
you can actually look up and be like
is this something that's worthwhile
because if you have enough subjects
right the sample size is big enough and
your stats are very precise
you can find all kinds of significant
differences between groups of people
different treatments but you can't
really tell how big of a difference that
is so for example
if you have two supplements and one of
them is significantly better than the
other
but it turns out it increases
hypertrophy by one quarter of a percent
per year
you could say it's significantly better
but it costs twice as much
you're like fuck like unless i'm gunning
for the mr olympia why the fuck would i
pay twice as much for a supplement
that barely gets me noticeable games now
now to be fair if it's significantly
different
it will get you it will get you
different gains
it will by definition get you better
gains but are they going to be notable
well that's an effect size thing so
anytime you read a study for internal
validity you look at the significance
you're like okay check it was
significant which means we can go on and
say okay something probably happened
check the effect size because it could
be such a small effect size you're like
all right there's a difference here but
kind of who gives a shit right
all right internal validity moving on
what about study durations
right so every time you look at this you
look at studies you see how they rank on
these things
here's the thing studies have to be long
enough for a studied effect to be able
to actually reveal
itself can you imagine an intelligence
test
that is one question along uh
you can't really show your swag off with
one question like what year was
christopher columbus born you're like
i don't know 14 something all right
sweet you're
fucking mentally retarded get out of
here like all right
hey how many questions does it take to
establish intelligence it probably
doesn't take a thousand
maybe like 30. you know if you get like
25
questions wrong out of 30 and they most
of them weren't that hard you're
probably not that smart
right if the test is well designed but
if you get like 25 of them right and
five of them wrong you're probably
pretty fucking smart so they can give
you a decent score
so long the test can be the duration of
like a number of questions
usually we'll talk about sports science
and exercise science the duration of how
long a treatment was applied
does creatine make you stronger here
take creatine for a day
are you stronger you fucking kidding me
the effect isn't even revealed yet
because creatine isn't even loaded in
the cells yet
hypertrophy does this way of growing
training grow muscle if you test it
for three weeks like how much
hypertrophy can you get in three weeks
very little
and most going back to the tools thing
most analyses of hypertrophy most
imaging techniques and weight techniques
and rep techniques
they actually can't tell the difference
between such small amounts of
hypertrophy so you're basically going to
design a study if you compare three
weeks of hypertrophy using barbell curls
versus dumbbell curls
and you say look it's the same
hypertrophy you just
absolutely didn't give a really good
chance for shit to shine through
right it's like uh fighting enough prom
a fighter
and the duration of the fight is ends
after you officially throw one punch so
you like run up to him you go boom and
you hit him really quick and he just
winds up on you he's about to fuck you
up
and they're like stop the test this is
the better fight and you're like ha
got you right and you're like wait hold
on how do we really pick who the best
mma fighter is
well we want some rounds man we want
like three five minute rounds and here's
the cool thing
ufc does this real well if you really
want to know who's the best like for a
championship match what do you do you do
more rounds
right a real good duration you know
because some weird shit can happen
people can have the shit can change and
it could be like a non-definitive
outcome and three
rounds and people are still feeling each
other out it's like a points battle
but after five fucking rounds we're
probably gonna know what the fuck is
going on so study has to be long enough
for that effect to shine through i'll
tell you what it's up to the researcher
it's up to the reader to to figure out
if this is true for a study
but it's really up to the researcher to
give a good faith test
and there's a lot of bad faith tests out
there a lot of people are
in this i can't believe i'm defending
supplements but there's a lot of people
out there that are very anti-supplement
in research and what they'll do
is they'll test a supplement and give it
an intentionally really short study
because it's easier on everyone right
it does a short study it costs less
money and they'll conclude like oh the
supplement doesn't do anything told your
supplements are bullshit like fuck you
you didn't even give the supplement a
chance you give it eight weeks to give
it 12 weeks
something based on the mechanism of how
the supplement works and based on our
the power of our detection tools for
improving aerobic fitness or whatever it
is we're looking at that supplement to
do
are we giving it a good chance to really
either show off
or enough rope to hang itself with
that's what study duration is about
right and for doing that you have to
understand how long some processes take
to design the right tests for example
if you're testing strength improvements
if two groups train in two different
ways for strength
and you test as soon as the program ends
how is that bad
well you don't understand that fatigue
takes time to go away
if one of the groups had a higher volume
of training that could be to have a
higher accumulated fatigue
which means they got stronger because
they did more volume more dose
more response but they also got more
fatigue so at the end of the day
right after the study ends the group
that did the higher volume performs
exactly the same way as the group that
did the lower volume
why because they had uh more adaptation
they were actually stronger underneath
it all they had more fitness
but they also had more fatigue on top of
it so it canceled out and they say see
it doesn't matter low volume high volume
doesn't matter
right but a good research design knows
how long these processes
takes and again gives it the best it
gives the effect the best chance of
shining through
like we're not doing studies to try to
disprove some shit like i bet this
doesn't work
we're trying to learn and if we're
trying to really see if something's
going on we're not going to like take a
quick blink of it
that's that's all i needed to see right
if you really want to know about
structure of something you're going to
take a good hard look
right so how do you do that you wait for
fatigue to dissipate and you know
fatigue takes about a week to dissipate
back to really low levels and
intermediate athletes that's who we're
testing
so what we're going to do is we're going
to end the study for a week the guys are
just going to live in population do
whatever
and we're going to test their strength a
week later well the high volume group
gain more strength
and both now are low fatigue they come
back a week later the high volume group
fucking multiply their strength way more
than the other group and you're like oh
well shit high volume really works
because you gave it the proper duration
because you really wanted to figure out
what's going on anytime
you get lost in all this shit you think
how the fuck does like science work
think about the following example for
like designing a good study
um you're in like a camping trailer
right and there's like a potentially a
fucking like
wild animal in the bushes like there's a
fucking puma there you're in california
maybe how are you going to assess if
there's a puma there
okay if your idea is like uh looks like
no it's the middle of the night you're
like that
i don't see anything you can go out
there and get water from the well are
you gonna be the cocksucker to walk on
fuck
no what are you gonna want to do you're
going to want to shine as much light in
the bushes as possible
right as much statistical power as you
can to see what the fuck is going on
you're going to want the duration to be
pretty fucking good you don't watch that
shit close as fuck
for like 15 minutes and be like i got
nothing i got nothing i got nothing like
wait let's go it's good enough like are
you fucking kidding me they get a
fucking puma in there
you might want to even do an
intervention where you throw a rock in
there and you see if anything moves
after you know 15 20 30 minutes of that
you throw like three rocks in there you
can pretty much see all the trees in
that little area and there's nothing
there except for the well
it's probably not fucking puma in there
right that's good science
that's good logic that's cutting the
analysis
the slack it needs to really show what's
going on but like if you want to prove
that there's no puma and you're willing
to bet your life on it you can just
fucking run out into the dark man and
he's like wow
wow i guess that's what pumas sound like
i had a spirit animal it would not be a
puma all right
lastly for observational research
let's talk about covariance right
because we said we're going to save that
for last
covariates are the similar concept to
controls in an interventional study
in an observational study we call them
covariates
covariates because things co-vary they
vary with what we're observing
so they sometimes affect the same uh
or they have the same effect on what
we're measuring and we can't tell what's
going on for example
we measure two different groups of
people
we measure people that live in seattle
and we measure people that live in
detroit i'm from detroit and
metro metro detroit and metro seattle
and we say okay
we've taken a look at the seattle people
and we noticed that they are healthier
and it's because seattle people engage
in more outdoor activities
true by the way detroiters don't really
fucking do outdoor activities a whole
lot
seattle people are all fucking granola
crunchy motherfuckers they're all
fucking up and mountain rainier or
whatever the fuck right
maybe but hold on a second let's look at
those samples and turns out we collected
a bunch more data or we should have
let's try to statistically adjust all of
the other differences that could be
causing this difference
and see if it's still around for example
remember our claim
was it's more outdoor activities okay we
have a measure of how much outdoor
activities both
do and we have health and they seem to
have a relationship all right
who smokes more uh why does that matter
well if people in detroit smoke twice as
much
and you take smoking statistically out
like you look at just the people that
smoke a little in both cities
then it turns out now seattle people are
less healthy well there goes your whole
fucking idea about
you know doing outdoor activities
because it looks like it was a smoking
that did it
what about healthy food who eats more
healthy food seattle people or detroit
people i'm gonna fucking spare you
because it's seattle people
so how do you know if it's if it's the
outdoor activities right what about
drinking what about risk taking right
people in metro detroit might just like
like to do really highly risk taking
hobbies and dirt biking and shit like
that
versus in seattle they just do regular
hiking and derby can get your ass real
bad health if you fucking break your leg
and you're out for a while
maybe it's that maybe it's genetics
right the population groups that live in
metro detroit just might have like man i
don't know there's a whole lot of polish
people and maybe they have like more
prone to heart disease where
you know there's more like
czechoslovakian immigrants in the
seattle area and they're more prone to
heart disease
later but other problems so you need to
measure that who the fuck knows
so what you do for covariates is when
you have a lot of observational data and
tons of variables
at least as many of them again good
faith as you think could have an effect
you try and it's really easy to do
statistically
you cancel them out statistically you
reset everything
to say again okay is it really after
we've canceled everything out that we
know
about and that we've measured does the
effect
of making sure or does the effect of
outdoor hobbies
versus not or versus less outdoor
hobbies still present itself on health
if you've cancelled out as much shit as
you can think of and outdoor hobbies or
people who don't hobbies are still way
healthier like even if they eat the same
healthy diet even though they don't
smoke blah blah
it's starting to look like that's a
pretty decent hypothesis
right and then you can test it formally
in some kind of interventional study
but if you canceled out a bunch of stuff
and the effect it drops to like zero or
negative
you're like yeah i guess the outdoor
being more outdoorsy doesn't really have
an effect on health that we can see now
but could still be an effect
but this study is just not a good way to
generate that hypothesis
all right enough about internal validity
external validity all right
external validity is much simpler but
it's one of those things that either you
have some of it
or you have more of it or you have uh
you know
not a lot of it and you it's more about
okay
how powerful is the study going to be in
actually informing our choices
of what we learned from the study
internal validity tells us how much we
learn from the study
external liberty is how much we can use
that for example
what can we use your study conclusions
to predict
okay populations you find
that a certain warm-up protocol before
activity leads to better performance in
wrestlers
that was your study are you going to
tell volleyball players to do it
i don't know that's a real different
sport so what is the external validity
of your study in regards to that
low low what is your external validity
if you try to predict it for other
wrestlers
pretty high right but what if you did it
in junior wrestlers like
for like six and seven year olds and
then you're trying to apply it to
olympic wrestlers again it's
pretty low and remember it's a spectrum
there's not like good or bad
it's like you know your channel
literally could be better it's not great
or it's like really really bad
situations right we do a certain kind of
weight training protocol
for basketball players playing in the
finals
and then we try to say that okay in off
season this is really good
hold on a second in the finals they're
carrying a shield more fatigue
so if you trade a weight training
protocol that works well
to increase performance in the finals
like in the you know the playoffs
it's going to be i promise you a much
lower volume a much more high power
output
and it's going to be one something that
doesn't cause a lot of fatigue because
if you tested something that caused a
lot of fatigue
you should as hell fuck them up and they
would do worse so then you say oh this
is the best way to train
let's do this in the off season but hold
on a second the offseason they play less
basketball
and potentially if they did more volume
very predictably they would get more
gains in the weight room
so if we try to take that situation one
to another
it's a really really bad deal and we can
get other stuff you know general advice
versus specific advice
right like if you measure something in
cellular metabolism
you say okay all human cells seem to
exhibit this that's a good general
statement but there may be a ton of
specific situations in which that
doesn't quite work that way
on the other hand if you picked a very
very specific type of cell
and kind of growth factor and age of
human that you extracted that from
and you try to apply it to a general uh
realm well man
maybe it's just the super specific
there's no winner here
it's all trade-offs there's no way to
have perfect externality there is no
such thing
external validity is a matter of looking
at the study and seeing
where and how to what situation it
is most externally valid and keeping it
right in that realm of what you take out
from it for example that wrestling study
if someone asks you like hey should my
wrestlers warm up like that like what
age group are they like well they're
young wrestlers like
boom probably a good idea to try it but
if they say hey i got volleyball players
that are you know olympians should they
try that you're like
maybe not right lower externality it's
all about recognizing it
and there's a potential trade-off
between internal
and external validity remember internal
validity is highest when we
make as many controls as possible for
example
when you are trying to assess if the
quads got stronger during
squatting versus leg pressing you might
set athletes up with the same exact
squat stance
in the precondition and the post
condition right before the training
happened and after the training happened
why would you
isolate the stance because if you didn't
tell them exactly where to put their
feet or at least measure where they put
them the first time and have them repeat
that exact one next time
maybe the reason they got stronger is
they just accidentally found a better
foot position or they got weaker and
they found a worse one that day
who the fuck knows is if you want a
really high internal liberty you
standardize everything you can
okay how externally valid is that well
fuck man
sometimes you know athletes perform you
know
through a variety of stances like if
you're trying to say like
quadricep strength increased in this
stance can you say
quadricep increa strength increase is
going to translate to wrestling or
volleyball
or basketball where they move all over
and press from different angles
lower but if you tested quad strength
in ecological setting like you just said
to the athletes like just choose your
best posture to put produce power and
show us what you got and then the post
test was the same way
are we as likely to conclude that the
quad strength improved
not really but if we do get that
conclusion it's way more externally
valid so we have lower internal validity
high externality it's not always that
trade-off
but sometimes it is it's okay to have
that trade-off
just be aware of it so if you want a
study that's really internally valid
be prepared to potentially be like now
the takeaways from the study
are mostly for other studies now that
we've sort of
given some proof to this concept we can
go on and say
other studies need to test this in a
more ecological setting that has higher
external validity
right but our study by itself i wouldn't
recommend it to athletes because we
don't know if it's an effect that
disappears in the laboratory
but we know there's probably an effect
so now it's time to test it in a more
externally valid study right
versus if your study is super externally
valid you can say look this probably
works
the thing is we're not sure exactly how
it works and it might not work super
reliably
so athletes definitely give it a shot
but like are we going to extrapolate it
to other groups and say look it works
for everyone because of these mechanisms
well we can't we didn't have enough
precision to detect the mechanism
so we can't say that it's a matter of
what you conclude it's not good versus
bad
right all right so big message
summing it all up peer review
ensures that many of these validity
measures are applied what the hell is
peer review
well you don't just publish a scientific
study you submitted to a journal and
other researchers in the field usually
blind so they don't know who you are
they don't know who wrote the article
you don't know who they are
they read the article and they're like
this needs to be fixed that's fucking
stupid and you said that wrong
or they look at it they basically go
through the same checklist we went here
and they're like well that's all really
good
if your study really sucks the journal
sends it back and says look you gotta
tell us what you did here and it better
be right and if it's not right they're
like look this just doesn't meet the
criteria of our journal you can't
publish this then you go back
you add to the study or you take some
more measurements that you
you took and then you reapply and then
you publish a study that's now better or
you at least have to explain yourself
better
so peer review ensures that many of
these validity measures are applied
however it's not everything
right you usually have to look into
studies if you're reading individual
studies
for yourself and that's how you judge
studies
how valid are the studies what is the
degree of internal validity what is
degree of external validity
because peer review gets you kind of
like a really low bar it gets you in
but all of the studies that have been
peer reviewed can still be ranked on
really internally and extremely valid to
the opposite so when someone's like hey
did you see that new study about what's
his name it's amazing i'm going to start
doing split squats now you're like oh
let me see the study
you look at the study and it's like a
fucking baller study you're like man
this is cool
pretty interesting hypothesis they
generated here i might even try it in my
own training but if the study is just
pure garbage
validity and it somehow sweep through
the journal review process then you're
like ah man fuck this study i'm just
gonna wait because i'm not fucking my
training over for some bullshit that's
this
by no means clear that's true right and
the thing is internal validity is
really well executed by the peer review
process like they're pretty good at
picking out shady and traveling like if
you don't have good controls they're
just telling you to go fuck yourself and
you can't publish
but external validity is mostly on you
the reader of the studies
right sometimes in the discussion
section
the study authors will try to estimate
external validity they'll be like what
you can do
with this research how here's how you
could potentially apply it but a lot of
times
it's just a lot of fluff so read when
you read the study
read the methods read the results and
you can read the
discussion later after already getting
what you think out of it already
using your own external uh validity
filters and be like okay i think i can
apply to this
then you read the discussion you're like
okay they agree with me or okay they're
totally off base so i wouldn't just go
on faith
for sure all right and so all is taken
together next time someone says like
well this study shows that
and they're super confident about it
give them the squint and they ah
let me see the study and you look at the
study and it could be a good study
could be a not so great study could be a
terrible study and the confidence of
your conclusions from that
is reflected on how good the study does
next time we're going to talk about
exactly that last
process of now that you're categorizing
studies based on how
external internally valid they are how
do we really start to draw proper
conclusions for action
based on those studies folks will see
you next time
you
