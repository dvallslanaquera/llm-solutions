in this video i'm going to explain how
to build muscle in five levels of
increasing complexity
starting with the most basic explanation
and getting more detailed
as we go now in preparing this video i
consulted with a number of different
experts including a professor in muscle
metabolism
an industry leader in the field of
biomechanics and an active researcher in
the field of strength and conditioning
i'm also a pro natural bodybuilder
myself and i've been studying the
science behind getting jacked for over a
decade
while coaching people from around the
globe and just for fun i'd like you to
comment below which level you got to
before you started zoning out or getting
lost
[Music]
all right so building muscle is actually
pretty simple all you really need to do
is lift weights and eat protein protein
of course being the macronutrient found
in foods like fish
chicken meat dairy beans lentils and
protein powders
and when you weight train your muscles
start to think well if we're going to
keep lifting these heavy weights
i'd better start to get some bigger
muscles to make this easier
this is called an adaptive response and
it's kind of like when you play guitar
your fingertips start to get harder and
grow calluses as an adaptive response to
pressing against the strings
it hurts at first but then it gets
easier as you build the thicker skin
layer
however lifting weights isn't quite
enough on its own to build muscle
in order to build something you need
building blocks and when it comes to
muscle the building blocks are called
amino acids which you get by eating
protein so when you lift weights you're
telling the muscle it needs to get
bigger
and when you eat protein you're giving
the muscle the building blocks it needs
to actually grow
[Music]
so in reality it's probably not quite
good enough to just lift weights and eat
protein to get
really solid results for example if
you're lifting the exact same weight for
the exact same reps two years from now
that you lifted today
that probably won't be good enough to
keep the muscle growing sure you'll see
some decent growth at the beginning
because you've never lifted
any weight before but soon enough that
weight will no longer be challenging
enough to present a sufficient stimulus
for your muscle to continue growing this
is why we need to expand the
lift weights part to lift weights with
an emphasis on progressive overload now
the technical definition of progressive
overload is the gradual increase of
stress on the muscles
during weight training but we can simply
think of it as just increasing some
training parameter over time so from
workout to workout you want to add a
little bit of weight
or add an extra rep using the same
weight for example let's say you're
trying to grow your biceps
rather than doing three sets of 10 reps
with the same weight week after week and
month after month
it'd be much more effective to do three
sets of ten reps in week one
three sets of eleven and week two three
sets of twelve and week three
and then in week four you can go back to
ten reps again but this time add a
little more weight
now at a certain point you may not be
able to increase the weight or reps each
and every time
and that's okay there are still other
ways to apply progressive overload such
as by adding an extra set with the same
reps and the same weight
or even by doing something as simple as
controlling the negative a little better
or feeling a stronger mind-muscle
connection where you more consciously
feel the muscle squeezing and stretching
as you lift or
swapping out for a new exercise and
starting that overloading process again
also on the nutrition side we can do
quite a bit better than just saying
eat protein so to be more specific the
latest research shows that landing
between 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per
kilogram of body weight
per day so about 0.7 to 1 gram per pound
is a good target for maximizing muscle
gain for example if you weigh 165 pounds
or 75 kilos
you'd want to be eating somewhere in the
range of 120 to 165 grams of protein per
day
for general muscle building now there
may be some advantage in going a bit
higher in certain advanced situations
but this is a sufficient range for most
now if you're very high in body fat the
grams per unit body weight approach
won't work as well so let's say you're
300 pounds you don't really need
300 grams of protein per day so in that
case i simply prefer to use one gram of
protein
per centimeter in height because it
works independently of body fat
percentage
so let's say you're five foot nine or
about 175 centimeters tall
175 grams of protein would be plenty for
you it's not a perfect system but it'll
get you in the right ballpark
and while there is some evidence to
suggest that spacing your protein across
three to five meals throughout the day
might be more ideal if that suggestion
holds true it's certainly much
less important than simply hitting a
daily protein target in fact contrary to
common belief
training is a much more powerful
contributor to muscle growth than diet
and by quite a long shot so while it is
true that a caloric surplus will
drive muscle growth more effectively and
dietary manipulations like protein
timing
can have some impact i'm going to focus
the remaining levels
on maximizing the muscle response
through resistance training
so focusing on progressive overload is
smart but it still leaves a lot to be
desired in the gym
for example it doesn't tell us how hard
we should push it or how many sets we
should do or how many reps we should do
or how heavy we should be lifting so
next i want to take a quick look at what
the research says about the so-called
acute
training variables factors like effort
volume intensity
exercise selection and frequency now i
think effort is the most fundamental
variable for growth because no matter
how much you optimize all the other
stuff
if you aren't pushing it hard enough the
muscles simply won't grow
at least not optimally now there's
currently a raging debate within the
scientific community about exactly how
hard we should push each set
a relatively small group of experts
insist that all sets should be taken all
the way to muscular failure defined as
an inability to complete another rep
despite maximum effort but i'd say that
the mainstream scientific consensus is
that it isn't necessary to take sets all
the way to failure
but you do need to be pretty close you
shouldn't be leaving more than two or
three reps in the tank for most of your
sets
now of course there are a few exceptions
where leaving five or more reps in the
tank does make sense for recovery
especially when training primarily for
strength but as a general rule
most of your sets should be pretty close
to failure so you do need to push it
hard
maybe harder than you think up next
volume technically refers to the amount
of work you do
and this was historically calculated as
the number of sets times the number of
reps times the amount of load but as of
2015
most practitioners began to think of
volume simply as the number of hard
sets you do now over the last few years
it's become a popular meme
to think of volume as the quote primary
driver of hypertrophy
and if i ever said this i no longer
think it's the case
rather than more volume leading to more
growth what we instead see is a sort of
inverted utrend where more volume leads
to more growth only up to a point
past which further increases don't do
anything extra and then at a certain
point
adding more volume seems to be
counterproductive so there's this volume
sweet spot which seems to be a bit
different for everyone and i find a lot
of people are already doing more volume
than they really need
and would probably benefit more by
reducing their volume and focusing more
on
effort and execution but the main point
is that you should experiment and figure
out what dose of volume gives you the
best balance of gains
and recovery still based on what we know
from the current science something
around 10 to 20 sets per body part per
week
seems to be a good range for most people
and most muscles so for example if
you're running an upper lower split that
has you in the gym four days a week
your chest volume might look something
like this with six hard sets for your
chest on monday
and six hard sets for your chest on
thursday totaling 12
hard sets for the week okay next we need
to cover intensity which despite its
popular conflation with effort
technically refers to how heavy the
weight is you can either lift heavy
weights for low reps or light weights
for high reps
but what's the best for muscle growth
well it turns out that as long as you're
taking sets sufficiently close to
failure
you can maximize hypertrophy using high
reps or low reps
or a combination of both research has
shown that reps as low as 3
and reps as high as 30 all cause similar
muscle growth however
there does seem to be a limit to how
light you can go new data shows that
when you lift weights lighter than 20
of your one rep max you do see
significantly less growth
but the average rep count subjects got
with that load was 67 revs
not a very practical way to train
regardless so the traditional 6-12 rep
zone is
kind of a myth in the sense that
research shows you can go well outside
that range
and still grow fine as long as you're
training close to muscular failure
still i think there is some value in
that 6 to 12 range
because once you start dipping down
below 6 reps you can risk unnecessary
strain on your joints
and it can be practically more difficult
to accumulate enough volume and the more
often you go above 12 reps
the more you risk just burning yourself
out as higher rep sets are harder to
recover from so for practical purposes
i suggest splitting it up like this with
the majority of your sets coming in that
6 to 12
or maybe 15 zone while having smaller
chunks dedicated to lower reps for
continued strength progression
and higher reps for stimulative variety
now i think exercise selection and
execution is just as much an
art as it is a science sure i do tend to
favor multi-joint compound movements
like squats presses and rows in my own
training
because they give you more hypertrophic
bang for your buck by activating large
amounts of muscle mass
while promoting more efficient total
body strength gain while i definitely
think mastering these basic compound
movements is important
single joint isolation exercises
certainly have their place especially
when it comes to targeting smaller
muscles
like the biceps rear delts side delts
and abs which can be overpowered if you
focus on compound lifts exclusively
luckily when it comes to muscle growth
there are no mandatory exercises
and so after mastering the basics it's
once again important to experiment with
different movements and movement
variations
to figure out what works best for you
and your body's mechanics
now when it comes to frequency it seems
like most people have flipped from
thinking that you should only train each
body part once a week
on a split that looks something like
this otherwise you're going to over
train and melt your muscle away
to these days most people thinking that
if you train on a bro split like this
you're never going to make any gains at
all because science
in reality the latest research actually
shows that frequency in and of itself
likely plays a relatively minor role in
muscle growth
and the latest studies show similar
results between hitting a body part once
a week and three plus times per week
however
i still generally recommend hitting a
muscle at least twice a week
and i do prefer splits like upper lower
and full body over the traditional body
part split
because they typically allow for more
volume per week and higher quality
volumes per workout
still as long as you've got all the
other variables in place are recovering
properly and being consistent over time
this is an area of programming that
probably deserves less of the spotlight
than it tends to get
and then there are other training
variables like rest periods lifting
tempo and advanced intensity techniques
that make up a relatively smaller piece
of the puzzle
and rather than go into detail on these
i'll just link a few videos on them down
below
[Music]
okay so with progressive overload and
the main acute training variables in
mind
at this point i'd like to get a bit more
granular and take a closer look at
what's actually driving muscle growth
physiologically so in 2010
dr brad schoenfeld published a landmark
paper with over 500 citations
that introduced the three factor model
of muscle hypertrophy this model
proposed that there are three main
things driving muscle growth
mechanical tension muscle damage and
metabolic stress
now the very short version is that
mechanical tension is the type of force
that tries to stretch a muscle fiber one
way to visualize this is like a tug of
war
as each side pulls tension is generated
in the rope so you can think of it like
not only are the people pulling on the
rope but the rope is also pulling back
on the people
similar in the muscle where tension is
passively created when the muscle is
stretched
and tension is actively created during
contraction when actin molecules are
pulled
by myosin heads and as of now tension
remains
absolutely undisputed as the primary
driver of hypertrophy within the
scientific community at large
next muscle damage is basically exactly
what it sounds like physical damage to
the muscle like micro tears and other
cellular disruptions
and you can observe this under a
microscope where you see that the normal
pattern and muscle can be seriously
disrupted after training
now some believe that this type of
damage is at least partly responsible
for the delayed onset muscle soreness
that you can feel in the days following
training
although the soreness phenomenon is no
doubt caused by a number of factors
and still isn't fully understood still
for years many people have just assumed
that getting sore
should be the goal of training since
soreness comes from muscle damage
and muscle damage causes muscle growth
but the latest science shows that that
first claim is questionable
and the second claim is most likely not
true of course the most common sense way
to think about this is that running a
marathon would cause
tons of muscle damage but wouldn't do
anything good for muscle growth
in fact a review paper from lack origin
colleagues pointed out that if anything
damage in this context would seem to
decrease muscle growth and even in a
weight training context
damage doesn't seem to be doing much
good the study from domison colleagues
argued that damage doesn't even
correlate with hypertrophy over the long
run
as shown in the figure here early on in
a training program you see a huge amount
of damage this could be why you get so
sore when starting a new routine
and while there is an associated early
spike in muscle protein synthesis
the vast majority of that synthesis is
directed toward repairing
damaged muscle tissue rather than
building new muscle tissue from scratch
and it's only after that damage
decreases that muscle protein synthesis
is directed toward new muscle
hypertrophy and while folks playing
devil's advocate could argue
well studies show that eccentric
training causes more muscle damage
and studies also show that eccentric
training causes more muscle growth
i would simply respond that correlation
doesn't imply causation
and it seems more likely to me that the
extra growth that you see from eccentric
overloading
could simply be coming from the fact
that you can simply overload the muscle
more heavily
during an eccentric contraction causing
more tension in the muscle
now i should say that if we're being
really honest we don't actually
understand muscle damage all that well
even the methods of simply measuring
muscle damage have been contested by
prominent researchers
so the bottom line is that any theory
that uses muscle damage to explain
muscle growth is speculative at best and
unfeasible
at worst but what about metabolic stress
well metabolic stress refers to the
accumulation of metabolites like lactate
and hydrogen ions
and the muscle hypoxia that often
follows weight training
and it's often associated with the
massive skin tearing pumps that you get
from high rep workouts
so if muscle damage and its ensuing
soreness is unlikely to be driving
muscle growth
surely the pump in its associated
metabolic stress
must be doing something i mean even
arnold seemed to recognize this
the greatest feeling you can get in a
gym or the most satisfying feeling you
can get in the gym
is the pump your muscles get a really
tight feeling
like your skin is going to explode any
minute you know it's really tight it's
like somebody blowing air into
into your muscle it just blows up and it
feels different
it feels fantastic and well while the
pump does feel good and certainly can
make training more enjoyable and perhaps
even provide some feedback that you're
actually hitting the muscle that you're
trying to target
it most likely isn't driving hypertrophy
because there are just too many examples
of where the relationship between
metabolic stress
and muscle growth breaks down shorter
rest periods cause more metabolic stress
but significantly less muscle growth
than longer rest periods note that
there's a footnote in the description
box about this
partial range of motion causes more
metabolic stress but often less muscle
growth and full range of motion
training all the way to failure causes
more metabolic stress but it best
results in equal muscle growth to
stopping a few reps shy of failure and
blood flow restriction training causes
tons of metabolic stress but doesn't
enhance hypertrophy on its own
and doesn't even work in conjunction
with training unless the training
methods are highly suboptimal
and even in this case it still seems to
point back to tension when i spoke with
one of the authors of this popular blood
flow restriction study
he pointed out that any benefit seems to
be tension related
would you argue that the impact of bfr
essentially leads back to just creating
more tension
in the muscle like do you think it still
goes back to tension yeah it's like it's
just
bfr is it's like cheating 20 reps extra
in a sense it's it's the same effect you
just
it just happens earlier so consensus is
converging
on tension and perhaps tension alone as
being the primary driver of muscle
growth
and so it should be the primary goal of
our training to maximize tension
above anything else so how do we do that
well the practical application is
actually quite simple
we need to apply progressive tension
increases
to the muscle itself this means we need
to lift with good consistent technique
while using the acute training variables
and progressive overload
to push the level of intramuscular
tension up over time
also paying attention to things like the
mind muscle connection at least on
certain exercises
and eccentric control should also help
as those aspects of lifting have been
shown to increase intramuscular tension
okay so we know that mechanical tension
is the main thing driving muscle growth
but what happens next how do we get from
a mechanical stimulus like tension
to a biochemical signal that commands
the muscle to grow
well dr tromlin explained this to me in
terms of blocks of dominoes
he said that when one thing gets
activated it passes on the signal to the
next thing
and the next thing and so on but if
you're smart you don't just build one
chain of dominoes
you build out all these side chains so
that they fall in a bunch of different
directions
and it's the same thing with muscle
growth there isn't just one pathway with
one outcome
but rather many different interconnected
pathways with many different
downstream effects so with that in mind
let's start at the top
all right so we lift a weight heavy
enough that it creates active mechanical
tension within the muscle
this is called the stimulus the stimulus
is sensed by mechanosensors
which sort of feel that the muscle is
being pulled into tension
and pass that signal on now based on the
latest research it isn't perfectly clear
exactly which molecules are doing this
sensing but the top candidates include
customers
which are collections of proteins that
sit in the muscle fiber membrane and are
responsible for holding muscle fibers
together
and transferring force between muscle
fibers during contraction
there's also titan which as a fun fact
is actually the largest protein we've
ever discovered in humans
and because it runs parallel to the
muscle fiber itself could theoretically
be responsible for sensing mechanical
changes like stretching
but probably only at long muscle lengths
and then there's filaments which bind to
the famous actin proteins that slide
during contraction making them a really
good candidate for sensing tension
and for the record i read through the
latest paper on all this sensing stuff
from 2018
and i'll just say this area of research
is not well understood yet
to quote the authors directly
conclusively identifying major
hypertrophy stimuli
and their sensors is one of the big
remaining questions in exercise
physiology
still we can paint the rest of the
picture with a broad brush for now
from the mechanosensors a signal gets
sent to a beast mode molecule called
mtor which is a major regulator of
cellular growth in general
not just in muscle tissue it's also
implicated in many cancers because of
its responsibility in making tissues
bigger from there mtor goes to the
nucleus and tells the dna machinery to
produce a messenger rna strand
which you can think of as a set of
blueprints for building new muscle those
blueprints are sent to a ribosome which
is like a muscle protein building
factory
that manufactures a string of amino
acids based on the blueprint from the
mrna
in a process known as translation and
this step is what we're actually talking
about when we say
muscle protein synthesis now through
this translation process
many different proteins will be
synthesized some of which will be the
big contractile proteins that make us
more jacked
others will be more ribosomal proteins
or mtor proteins themselves
so anabolic growth potential remains
high in the future
now if this rate of synthesis exceeds
the rate of breakdown protein balance is
said to be positive
and in that case new contractile
proteins are incorporated into muscle
fibers
resulting in what's called myofibrillar
hypertrophy leading to increased muscle
size
overall but all of that is really just
one string of dominoes
there's also this other path that's
triggered by amino acids in the protein
we eat
in this case amino acids are transported
inside the cell and the amino acid
leucine
also activates mtor for the record we
seem to need about 3 grams of leucine
to stimulate mtor which can be found in
about 20 to 25 grams of high quality
protein
although some research has shown greater
anabolic responses with higher protein
doses so it may be possible to crank
mtor activity higher with more leucine
but regardless
it's important to realize that the
stimulative impact of leucine is much
shorter than the stimulative impact of
weight training
and so for maximum mtor stimulation you
need both training
and leucine with leucine essentially
complementing the stimulative effects of
weightlifting
then the other eight essential amino
acids there's nine in total when you
include leucine
make their way to the ribosome where
they're used as the fundamental building
blocks for creating new muscle
now another pathway that i'll briefly
mention is that of testosterone
now even though modifying testosterone
within the natural range plays a
relatively minor role in muscle growth
when you inject high-dose testosterone
the hormone crosses the muscle cell
membrane and either binds to an androgen
receptor directly
or is converted to dht which then binds
to the androgen receptor and then that
complex enters the nucleus and tells the
dna to start cranking out more
blueprints
turning up that muscle protein synthetic
process even more
now if i were actually discussing muscle
growth with an expert there are a lot of
other things
i'd want to discuss i'd want to at least
mention sarcoplasmic hypertrophy so far
we've been focusing on myofibrillar
hypertrophy so the growth of
actual contractile tissue but there's
some new solid evidence supporting
so-called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy which
is the growth of all the other stuff
inside the muscle fiber like glycogen
organelles and other non-contractile
proteins
then i might speculate that higher rep
and higher volume training might bias
the muscle towards sarcoplasmic growth
but then the expert depending on how
open they are to guesswork
might shut that down for lacking
evidence i'd also definitely want to
talk about myonuclear addition
the idea that all this muscle protein
synthetic stuff still seems to be
limited by the number of nuclei
or command centers that you have in your
muscle cells to begin with
and so when satellite cells that
surround the muscle cell like satellites
donate their nuclei that could
theoretically allow the muscle cell to
crank out more new muscle protein
and build more muscle but then the
expert might push back that that theory
is
actually pretty speculative and we can't
even rightly assume that nuclei are in
fact
limiting factors for hypertrophy until
we get more science in our hands
and then a curious bystander might ask
why does any of this matter anyway
what's the point of this level of
research
maybe the expert would respond by saying
something like knowledge having value
for its own sake or maybe they point out
a few of its many medical applications
such as in understanding sarcopenia or
muscular dystrophy or maybe they'd say
that they're trying to figure all this
stuff out
just in case there's a new pathway that
can actually feed back into training
recommendations
or maybe we'll be able to use this
research to develop an exercise pill
someday
that creates the same cellular effect as
weight training without having to spend
nearly as much time in the gym a sort of
steroid without side effects that could
start development
50 years down the road but since i'm
getting well over my own head at this
point i think i'm gonna leave it there
for this one if you guys made it this
far
please let me know by commenting i'm
ready for level six and i'll see if i
can make that happen in another video
as new research comes in as always don't
forget to leave me a thumbs up if you
enjoyed the video
subscribe if you haven't already and
i'll see you guys all here in the next
one
