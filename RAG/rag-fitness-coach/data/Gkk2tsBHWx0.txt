pulse hold hold hold hold
hold hold
the easiest shit I ever had to do in my
life
[Music]
hey guys
it's me Dr Mike this large man here with
the salmon on
Jared feather ifbb Pro
we have a we have a problem no problem
and you have a similar problem you want
big dealt desperately more than anything
in your life obviously and you only have
one barbell and a couple weights laying
around how can you possibly do a
holistic
total dealt smash RAB destroy pillage
plunder pause
you know like when the Empire comes to
new planet the Galactic Empire from Star
Wars
20 years later they finished that ish
off and none left that type of shit to
your delts is that even possible
what do you think Jared you a long time
service of the Empire not without
optimal exercises incorrect joint angles
wow spoken like someone who wants the
Galaxy to be crushed with an iron fist
let's get started
[Music]
all right folks so a super super common
problem in shoulder training is that
people like to have their egos Drive
their shoulder training instead of a
specific look at what the Aesthetics of
shoulder training really demand
almost all of the work you'll ever need
for front delts but a small part can
come from pressing for your chest and
triceps so a lot of people will start
with dumbbell presses and then go to
machine presses and then do some
laterals and do the mail-in rear delt
shit afterwards we're going to do the
opposite because the front delts on
people are almost never the lagging
problem
big rear delts man I'm telling you I was
at the beach once and I had like super
pump rear delts and this girl walks by
the table I was there with my wife and
she's like she looks at my wife she's
like I don't need to do this but like
can I please have some kind of physical
relations with your husbands and I was
like oh and she's like we're adults only
the rest of him is disgusting in any
case I almost got laid which is sweet
and you could get full on laid if you
have big ass rear delts huge side delts
and look you already have pretty big
front belts for how big the other delts
on your body are in most cases so
because we're going to do the most cases
Jared's first exercise is going to be a
superset over barbell face pulls really
rear delt specific two upright rows
where the rear delts are involved so
it's the rear and side delts hit first
then we move on to another exercise that
might hit a little bit of the side and
front delts and then our last exercise
for this workout is going to be
something that ties it all in together
and is brutal and it doesn't mean you go
heavy but God damn it's going to feel
terrible for your delts in the best way
let's do it let's fuck
I like you're a fucking idiot
did you really fucking count five oh bro
I know you hate that shit
eight
this don't count okay you're a fucking
idiot
good stuff let's go
do it stable upper body
beautiful
good
good two more you got this 100 yes one
more slow it down on the way down slow
yep
yep
fuck yeah slow good shit
I don't have fucking training Partners
like him
I counted three yeah
successfully have a gelt pump already
yeah but it's just starting I'm very
sensitive to this shit why did you come
off contest yeah so you're very uh
sensitive to the carbohydrates oh hell
yeah and you're getting big pumps which
is good which means you're probably
anabolic technique stuff for the bent
over face pulls so it's a Facebook with
a barbell you're going to want to bend
over keep a tight core none of this like
rounding back shit attention on your
hams you're gonna get to like a 45
degree angle and really it's kind of
dealer's Choice how low you go
you're not going to pull the bar into
your neck you could do that but it ends
up being kind of weird for the shoulders
it seems like a more comfy bar path is
usually when people come up and try to
almost get past their nose and kind of
touch their brow ridges
now you might not be able to get that
high but it's kind of this arcing motion
ended up hitting a lot of side delt in a
shitload of rear delt and a majority is
going to do a stand right back up now
he's in a mechanically more advantageous
position and he's going to stay a little
bit slightly Bent Road
to again bias that side delt and even a
little bit of rear it up more and then
knock out some upright rows usually the
same weight can get you a decent amount
of reps in that first set and then a
super set it can get G whiz you know
five to ten in most cases sometimes a
little more which makes it an awesome
superset you don't want a weight that
you do for 15 times here and you come up
here and do it once and you're like
that's it so as misapplied
Jared will take the rest three sets
sets of 10 to 20 reps maybe a little a
bit higher as recommendation here if you
go a lot heavier on here and ends up
just being kind of weird for the
shoulder joints you'll go home you'll
cry your mom will come up and be like
hey listen it's okay
all right and you'll be like Mom you're
the best and she's like yeah no worries
man all right I'm like shut up
already shut the fuck up
Mike you you train the least heart out
of all of us and you're always like come
on now no rest three seconds let's go
typical tough guys shut up I gotta talk
a big game because I ain't shit fuck
when people are family they fight in a
different way you guys know Jared is my
biological son of course
last set equivalent set that's good I
don't know why the last set has to be
the best setup
maybe it's because they know their
technician to break down
oh yeah
[Music]
fuck yeah
oh boy
[Music]
foreign
she was Master
there's your big deal oh
whenever you feel rested Jared
I think the bar is plenty yeah no shit
so just let me know if that's correct
[Music]
yeah let's cover that
so front raises if you do it with an
easy bar or neutral grip or underhand
and you do them like this it's almost
all front belts but if you take an
overhand grip
and you come up and all the way down it
actually tends to be considerable on a
front delts but also a bunch of side
belts so that was what we're going to do
next you're always going to do straight
sides his delts are already pretty
cooked
this is the super ROM version of front
raises we go sort of all the way up and
all the way down
it's not bad for your shoulders unless
you have
female genitalia for shoulders
not allowed to say anything more
offensive than that today's political
climate
so but real talk if it feels bad for
shoulders don't do it just stop at a
certain point
and you'll notice that Jared's only
gonna be doing the bar
which is really all it takes at this
point is a really tough exercise because
the Leverage is so so long so
probably three straight sets here and
then we'll get into our last exercise
after that
[Music]
slow
oh boy
bad hit the spot yeah
troll was hard a little tip here on the
front raises
this part's pretty easy
this part's pretty easy
the part you really want to demonstrate
a lot of eccentric control on is the
part from here to here and that's where
you're going to see most people have
more bar speed it's the opposite of what
you need to do
stable bar speed up
slow
stable up
slow control
faces Expressions thoughts up
slow yes
slow yes two more
control gorgeous
[Music]
control oh yeah fuck yeah
[Applause]
[Music]
one more
big control yes
oh
I can't find a comfortable position for
my fucking lateral adults right now yeah
but biomechanically you ever think about
biomechanics just think about it fuck
[Music]
all right folks
last exercise coming up
this is going to be upright rows
but
different than before much less low just
the bar mind you Jared is like
2 30
.
235 511
ifb classic physique Pro
delts all over the map he's using 45
pounds so adjust accordingly
mile reps here each set is going to be
just one mile rep pause just gonna do a
bunch of reps of upright rows pause for
a second hold the bar in his hands
wait about five seconds and then do as
many as he can which might be two or
three
here's the trick though
he is going to be going to just up above
his head
pausing for a split second and then
slowly controlling The Descent coming up
quick pausing slowly controlling
this type of upright row is totally fine
for most people's shoulders
if it's not good for yours don't do it
no big deal just do the regular ones or
anything else you want to do
but it will cook your ass literally
[Music]
a couple more a couple more you got this
[Music]
oh yeah
oh yeah fuck yeah no yes
[Music]
foreign
holy shit
side belts front belts my side belts
side belts yeah literally can't fucking
lost that in my forearm oh you're
cramping holy shit
fucking hey Rachel raise your arms up
and pretend you have a bar go go go go
pause at the top
and back up
and back up
good and back up
go hold and one more and back up hold
five seconds one two three
four and five
oh
yeah
oh that was close
I'm calling my index finger go
one more set we had to step in and make
sure that the mile rep part of that
worked out Jared's forearm cramped
couldn't lift the bar and I used my
quick wits
thank you
anyway uh to make sure that somehow we
could get that shit going and I realized
he doesn't need his form to just lift
his arms and I also know that after a
big set like this just lifting arms is
insanely difficult so with that shit
managing the Cadence and not letting him
get to a more mechanically advantageous
position down here kept him up here a
shit is brutally
yes
gorgeous what do you think bonus round
so far down
first time you have dumbbells to lateral
raise 45 degrees
off
yes and slow and up
up
as soon as you touch me go up
yes three more Jared
up one
up
two last one up
hold hold hold hold
on hold hold
really easy shit I ever had to do in my
life and relax ah
man fuck this may be the biggest adults
have ever been
and maybe
that's ridiculous
let me sum up this workout
Jairus delts bumped into him at the bar
like this and she was like fuck you dog
you don't want this and the Dove's like
fuck you bro I stay strapped and as soon
as I went to reach for that Gap Jared
did some like John witch
and everyone in the box like he's
already dead and he's like
[Applause]
yeah
that's uh
those clips that I unloaded while he's
on the ground or that last exercise
because I was already fucking toasted
you're going to jail for a long time
that's okay
yeah jail training do you guys want to
see a jail training video awesome jail
program like the township Marcos has
been on us for forever yeah he's like
you go shut up Marco the barbell one is
nice this was good yeah yeah
all right if we do a jail workout nerd
alert it's gonna be Star Wars Universe
alien Super Jail I mean like the droop
comes out of the wall that kind of thing
oh God uh let us know if you want that
shit Jared good job today vicariously
pushing me failing being hurt through
adults and failure and pain is what this
whole industry is about
foreign
[Music]
there are other senses you should have
farted into my mic I could have been
down ah you're right that would have
been awfully close to your face
