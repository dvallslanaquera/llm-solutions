welcome back to
this vlog
i am now seven weeks out today i want to
discuss a few things including
how to handle getting sick during
training how to modify training as you
get closer to show day or contest prep
day rate of weight loss during contest
prep and finally
my personal plans to curb hunger
and finish this qantas prep strong in
terms of weight loss
so first up i want to discuss
how to handle getting sick in relation
to training cutting and so forth
now for some background i recently got a
cold as you may or may not be able to
hear
that's why my voice sounds a bit off
today and why i might not be as high
energy as usual even though i'm
apparently
very rarely high energy especially
during prep
so how do you handle getting sick during
prep
during prep specifically you are a bit
more likely to get sick and get ill
it's a pretty common thing for people to
get sick as to get closer and closer to
show day
because as you're in deficit as you have
low carry intakes as you're leaner etc
you're just a bit more likely to get
sick
and most people get sick more often
during winter and fall or autumn
than they do during spring and summer
and so generally speaking if you can
avoid
doing really big cuts during
autumn or
winter that's probably a good idea
but then again
during contest prep you don't always
have that luxury so in my case for
example
my show is taking place on the 31st of
october and so i don't really have a
choice when to cut i sort of have to cut
in fall
and so
besides just
making sure you
don't cut for too long and don't really
elevate your own risk of getting sick
what can you do once you actually get
sick well it depends on how sick you get
and what sort of your sickness you have
in my case right now i have a bit of a
cold it's nothing too major it's enough
to make me sleep a bit worse
and to sort of make me out of breath a
little bit at times
but not much else
and
i think a good rule of thumb and this
isn't medical advice or anything but a
good rule of thumb is usually that if
you don't feel super rough and your
performance isn't being impaired by
being sick so for example you go train
and your performance is just as usual
it's essentially the same
and you don't feel super rough i don't
really think you need to modify your
training all that much
however the more it impairs your
performance and or the more rough you
feel
the more you should consider making
modifications to your training and or
diet
for example let's say
your performance isn't bad and you feel
quite rough in that case it might just
be best for you to take a maintenance
week or even just take time off entirely
depending on just how rough you feel etc
um but depending on the severity of your
illness
various adjustments can be appropriate
and justified
in my case because i only have a small
cold
no real adjustments necessary although
if it does get much worse
it might be a matter of me
taking my deal a week a bit earlier i
was planning on doing
not this upcoming week but the week
afterwards
and if this cold gets much worse then it
might be a good idea for me to
take a deload a week early and
just extend my next mother's cycle by a
week
which would work out just fine too
but that really depends on how sick you
get so we shall see
next i want to discuss how to modify
training as you get closer and closer to
show day
now
just as i just discussed how your immune
system
gets a bit worse and weaker as you get
closer to show day because you get
leaner you have consistently low energy
intakes potentially some micronutrient
deficiencies and so forth
um
overall your immune system isn't as
robust during prep as it would be
otherwise
the same applies to
injury but also to
just how likely you are to get injured
so
as you get closer and closer to shoday i
think it behooves you to switch more of
your trading tools to higher rep ranges
and also switch more of your training
towards the machine and
um
less unstable work
so for example
i had the option between doing
deficit sumo deadlifts which are quite
fatiguing and have
likely a decent injury risk based on
when you look at how often a strong man
and power of those get injured they get
injured a fair amount compared to
bodybuilders
um i'm not saying that's strong evidence
in favor of deadlifts being injurious
but you see a lot of injuries in lower
back um specifically and so it wouldn't
be a stretch to say that deadlifts
probably are fairly injurious
at least compared to something like
split squats and so in my case because
i'm getting closer and closer to show
day and my risk of injury is likely a
bit elevated it probably makes sense to
get more of my glute stimulus from stuff
like split squats especially on a smith
machine
or in something quite stable where i can
just re-rack the weight easily
with that on something like summer that
lifts which are
likely a bit more injurious and
anecdotally just kick the on me so
i would rather do more of my volume from
split squats into high rep ranges
next i want to discuss rate of weight
loss during complex prep
so generally speaking
during weight loss you want to aim for
around
0.5 to 1 of body weight loss per week
0.5 is more appropriate
if you're more prone to muscle loss and
or have a harder time dieting
so that might be because you have poor
genetics for muscle mass because you're
highly stressed because you have poor
sleep because you're not in pd's
a variety of reasons that can cause you
to be a bit more prone to muscle loss
and you being
you having a harder time with dieting
can also be due to a variety reasons
one of them would be
you've spent a lot of time cutting in
the past and so you have a lot of bad
fatigue
and in which case doing a quick cut can
be quite difficult it can require a
really low carry intake
it can make you a lot hungrier than you
would otherwise be and overall it might
not not just be sustainable or feasible
and so
if you're prone to muscle loss and or
you're not in a good position to be
dieting
you probably should stick to that bottom
end of that range so more towards zero
point five percent of body weight per
week
on the opposite of the spectrum um if
you're
pretty fat so high in body fat
you have good genetics you're using pvds
um
good sleep low stress and so forth
in that case it might behoove you to go
more towards the one percent of body
weight loss per week in fact you can
probably go even above that and you can
also go below 0.5 but i think for most
people most of the time that range
serves you pretty well
and so
if you have good genetics and so forth
one percent can walk
and also if you're in a good position to
be dieting if you find dieting should be
pretty easy
if you haven't died in a while and by
dieting i mean diet for weight loss
in those situations it can make sense
for you to lose quite quickly
and so how does this apply to complex
prep
at the beginning of columbus prep
hopefully if you do things properly
you should be in a pretty good position
to be retaining muscle mass to be
dieting and so forth in my case i was a
bit fatter than i should have been i was
maybe around 20 body fat ish um which is
probably a bit too fat to be starting
quantities prepared but hey
first time competing
um
we all make mistakes i'll just say that
so
in my case because i was pretty fat i
had pretty good sleep low stress
i was just being a diet i hadn't really
cut that much in the past few years
to be frank i'd gain around
30 kilograms in the space of three or
four years total so that's around 65
pounds
um
a fair amount of fat but also a lot of
muscle
so
i was in good position to be dieting and
it wasn't going to be particularly hard
at fast
and so i could afford to go quite
quickly
but then as
context prep progressed
and diet fatigue set in and i got leaner
and leaner
and at times stress got higher and right
now for example sleep is worse
and stuff like that
the rate of weight loss is naturally
going to slow down
um not naturally but it should slow down
because as you get leaner and leaner as
your propensity to lose muscle mass
increases and grows
you probably should slow down the weight
of weight loss
and so in my case right now
while i'm still
aiming
around 0.75 of my weight loss a week
it's
definitely slowed down compared to the
beginning and so i think that's
appropriate and i think for most people
starting a contest prep by cutting
pretty quickly
and then
slowly reducing rate of weight loss
until you reach showday is a good idea
anecdotally i feel pretty garbage right
now
and so
trying to cut really quickly now just
wouldn't work and this goes back to the
whole thing with
are you in a good position to be dieting
hard
at this point i am not in a good
position to be dieting super hard
i would lose muscle mass i would
struggle hunger-wise energy-wise
everything
and so right now a slow rate of weight
loss makes sense
note that some of the factors that make
you
better or worse at quick or slow weight
loss
are
essentially unchangeable and fixed like
for example your genetics your genetics
for how well you retain or gain muscle
mass those don't really change over time
but then other factors like
how much diet fatigue you have how good
of a position you are in
to be dieting in the first place those
factors do change
and so
if you want to have a successful diet
phase
i think paying attention to those
factors can make sense and it's
something i routinely pay attention to
when coaching clients
i ask them about the diet history i ask
them what they've been doing for the
past few months past few years etc
whether they started out being a bit
overweight or more skinny and so forth
and all of that can paint a pretty good
picture of
how quickly should they lose weight
should they lose weight are they ready
to lose weight and so forth and just
establishing those things early on can
make
the subsequent cut a lot more smooth
all right next up i want to discuss
my personal plans to curb hunger
stay active and finish this contest prep
strong
now
i've discussed this fair amount on
social media
but i'm getting quite tired uh i'm
reaching the under qantas prep i'm now
six weeks out or 43 days out to be
precise
and
stuff sucks um
i pretty much just feel like sitting
down and eating food
and that doesn't get you shredded so
i'm having to force myself to not eat
food and to actually move around and not
sit down
and so
for these last six weeks i'm going to do
my best to
keep it up
um
i think i can do it but it's definitely
hard and by comparison to other sports
i've done like basketball football etc
bodybuilding is
chronically speaking the hardest
um
anyways back to my strategies there's
two things i'm going to do going
forwards starting this week
one is i'm going to start having zero
calorie foods
there's
a type of noodle called i believe
shirataki noodle
um
which is
a noodle made from a satin root which
has very low calories they're expensive
but i've purchased them and that should
help fill me out a little bit with meals
and it's sort of a last resort for these
last six weeks
the second thing is using nicotine gum
during the last phase of this prep i'll
be using nicotine gum
for the whole month of october for
around four weeks until i hit the stage
um
those two things combined should
hopefully be good enough to see me
really reach the contest
the stage ready to compete
anyways in the video now you can see me
do some posing i'll be very shakedly
because
i was tired um
but yeah fun fact my gym does not allow
people to be shirtless
and so
you know this is about as good as it
gets unfortunately
unless i sneak in some pics
unbeknownst to the managers but you know
this is about it
um
and yeah the third thing i'm gonna do
to hopefully help a little bit is switch
a few more of my carb sources from
higher gi higher glycemic index and
lower fiber
so namely cereal to more higher fiber
less calorie dense carb sources so i'm
switching from cereal to sandwiches for
example so from uh
corn flakes with sugar to
um homemade bread which has a lot lower
of a gi a lot more fiber
and so hopefully a lot more volume
overall less carried out
and so hopefully that switch should help
with satiety as well
and so i can finish this
contest prep strong and
hopefully
you know
stage lean that's the aim
