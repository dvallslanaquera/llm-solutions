cookies have a certain amount of
calories certain amount of fats proteins
carbs if that fits and plugs in to your
daily plan which if you use the RP diet

context dependent depending on at least
three things macros calories and hunger
signaling and all of a sudden every food
isn't good and bad it's like good and
bad in context
