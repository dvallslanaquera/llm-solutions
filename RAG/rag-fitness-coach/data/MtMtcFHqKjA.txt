Mark Walberg has gardening gloves on
when he trains I just don't know why I
can't figure it out folks when you wear
gloves when you train it does nothing
for your calluses how do I know that I
used to wear gloves when I was younger
and it did nothing for my calluses and
also it's just gunky and Ooey and gooey
and sweaty and gross just don't do it
don't do it unless you have a compelling
reason I don't know about which maybe
Mark does but it's
unlikely
