here we go first condition
is whatever the deficit is it still
leaves you with enough food that allows
you to have a high training energy
as soon as you're eating so little food
that your training turns to dog shit man
that's probably not the ideal deficit
for you in most cases right you can
train hard with plenty of food and
enough energy you can spare all of the
muscle which means you don't lose any
muscle which is awesome and you have
tons of daily energy for calorie burning
activity and just getting all your stuff
done so if you can have a good enough
energy to do all your daily tasks and
train really hard then man that's a
really good thing any deficit that is
deeper than that will inevitably cause
pretty serious problems
