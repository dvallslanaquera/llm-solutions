hey folks dr mike here targeting the
muscle series
it's the most exercise anyone could be
doing in the gym for general fitness
the barbell shrug that's clearly a lie
but we do have tips let's get into the
first tip
now
[Music]
all right folks tip number one is don't
go heavy there's other folks on the
internet to say go heavy and maybe
they're right
but for many people that's not going to
work super well including myself
the thing about going heavy is you're
paying a really big axial fatigue cost
your spinal loading is something the
body seems to keep track of
independently of other kinds of fatigue
and if you load the spine a lot it just
fucks with you a lot tons and tons of
fatigue carries over into all of your
other lifts especially your leg lifts
like squats and hack squats and stuff
like that you get a lot of axial fatigue
from your trap training because you're
doing this with 1100 pounds you're going
to pay for in every other part of your
program secondly
if you do ultra heavy weight you either
reduce the range of motion which we know
is not hypertrophic
or your time spent generating tension is
so low it's not adequately stimulative
right the traps actually like quite a
bit of volume
we would suspect that because they're
active all the time keeping your
shoulder girdle functioning normally and
they're active and damn near every other
lift every time you curl they're active
every time your lateral raise are active
every back movement they're active even
when you do cable triceps push downs
they're active controlling things so you
need lots of volume and the best way to
get that is through higher repetitions
right so don't put 11 000 pounds on
there my best recommended rep range for
shrugs is the 15 to 30 repetition range
wait for these next few tips where i
show you how each rep works that really
multiplies the shift
when we're actually doing the
repetitions of the shrug we're going to
violate every rule of shrugs that you
have ever seen
one of the critical critical things
we're going to go for
is a full range of motion and a
controlled eccentric
this means that when i do shrugs
i'm not going to be doing the fucking
chicken dance or whatever the fuck
people do i'm sure you've seen it before
what i'm gonna do is shrug up nice and
high and then slowly control the
eccentric
and then shrug up nice and high and
slowly control
and try to hit up there for a second and
slowly control that slow control
is what is stimulating your traps the
entire time
that's a huge huge tip
it's going to
humble the living fuck out of you but
luckily you'll have to use a tiny
fraction of the way you normally do
you'll get insane trap pumps to all as
well
[Music]
next tip
the bottom is a tough part for the traps
you're weak down here
and if you just skipped here if you just
went from here to here you could chug a
lot
but the tip here is go super deep and
even hang out for a second at the bottom
so yep start up here slow
stretch
up
slow
stretch
up
slow
stretch
fuck all that noise
that big stretch at the bottom
putting a ton of tension
when that part of the traps those fibers
anyway are the most lengthened
brilliant hypertrophy stuff
it's a real sharp idea
i came up with it even you should try it
[Music]
all right next tip
is not on the technique
but on the rest time
if you're doing these shrugs like i just
described super full range of motion big
stretch etc
sets of 15 to 30 reps are going to fry
the fuck out and you're going to have
tons of metabolites and like
big trap pump and everything
the thing is because you're not going to
be using a lot of weight and because of
such a small muscle technically that's
doing anything
the level of systemic fatigue is super
low cardiovascular fatigue is super low
other muscles aren't really super
contributing especially if you have
wrist straps when your grip isn't a
factor the whole thing turns into
like this is not a big deal at all and
it just doesn't take a lot of time to
rest
so instead of lifting 9 000 pounds and
taking five minute rest breaks between
your shrugs
lift a small amount of weight really
good technique wraps 15 to 30 of them
and then rest until
the lactic acid and all that other
bullshit metabolite is out you know what
it is like
probably with a lot of trap training
five to 15 seconds after you're done
with the set
you're kind of good to go and again it's
going to cut your reps in a ton
like you're going to go from doing 17
reps on a first set to like 10 reps of a
second but those aren't 10 fresh reps
those are 10 reps with that lighter load
and it's still gonna blast you when you
do multiple sets like that resting only
10 to 15 seconds between sets it's gonna
fry your shit out it's not the way to
train traps but it's a way many of you
have not tried and if you try it and you
get fucking
terminator traps let me know that'll be
5.99
if you have trouble getting a good trap
hit from shrugs there's tons of
different exercises to use but there's
at least a few ways to take barbell
shrugs and spice them up with some
variation so that maybe you can find a
hit that works well for you the first
thing is instead of shrugging with
normal hands like this try it on much
wider grip it can be the thing
the other thing is to try to bend over
so
normal shrugs
we do here we do them like that right
but if you bend over a little bit just
hinge over what you can do is have
shrugs that hit
the back of your traps a little bit as
well as the upper part totally different
hit bigger stretch
i've used all these variations mixed
them up yes that means even you can bend
over and go wide at the same time
give them all a shot if barbell
structure is something that works well
for you these variations will only spice
it up
if barbell shards don't work well for
you take all these tips integrate them
together try the bending over try the
wide and try out the narrow see how it
goes
best of luck remember
tom hardy proved in the movie i guess
the warrior that uh or just warrior
traps are the only
only muscles that matter for a human
male
and also for a human female here you go
trap away see you guys
