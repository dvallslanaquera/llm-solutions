how do you feel about Natty or not
videos I think they're overrated because
I believe in innocent and T proven
guilty and if you're just speculating on
someone's natural status on scaned
evidence then you could be hurting their
reputation I don't think they actually
give you any value apart from the fun of
the drama I guess the idea is that oh if
they're not Natty then it's not
realistic for me to look like them but
you can't really look like anyone else
anyway
