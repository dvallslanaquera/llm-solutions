okay we got nothing to tell you man long
time jared feather client you know what
you're doing these are flawless
[Music]
hey folks i'm dr mike this is jared
feather this is ak he is a few things
jared's client for
men's physique yes
he is also
drug free
natural on
naturalism and a third thing which makes
him exceptional and why we are going to
torture the living soul out of his back
today he happens to be egyptian guess
who else is egyptian that's right
current mr olympia big raimi well
actually depending on when we release
this hopefully still current mr olympia
me
two times jared what do you think yeah
ak's four weeks out he's uh pretty deep
into his messa cycle so we're gonna be
pushing him pretty damn hard today
uh don't believe he has another deal
until the show so it's going to be
pretty fucking solid aka any last words
let's do it oh yeah hell yeah hell yeah
let's do it
so we're training aka
his back today and we're going to do a
vertical emphasis which means we're
going to start with pull-ups we'll
probably move on to another pull-down
movement and then another rowing
movement after we'll figure that this
out we are at iris kyles and hidata
yamagishi's powerhouse gym in las vegas
which is amazing so if you hear hit up
the dragon's lair
hit up you know what i'm saying the
strip yeah
well messed up i don't want to swear so
early in the video and then take a day
to recover get yourself in the day spa
welcome to vegas you feel me watch your
wallet day spa people i don't know who
is around shit like that and then
get your ass over to powerhouse right
here in vegas it's an unreal gym so
we're gonna feel around there's a ton of
equipment here we're gonna do our best
well we don't have to do anything jared
and i just yell at people i don't even
train i'm trained in years this is all
synthol let's get to pull-ups and we'll
go from there
three to five sets of pull-ups he can do
a whole lot of pull-ups with really
really awesome technique sets of all
geez 10 to 25 even maybe let's get it
done
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
oh yeah one more go go go go go go go go
good that's it
[Music]
good stuff very good excellent when
people like ak train and jared and i
train them it's kind of weird because
they don't have a lot to say it's like
technically flawless i got to stop
bringing my clients
like i don't know what to say in between
sets like i bring my clients and i'm
like i've already modified all their
shit so it's like yeah we don't have
anything to teach you man you're like a
little chiclet little bird free on your
own i guess you chicklets don't fly so
if you do that they just fall in any
case like a like a parrot oh parents
don't even leave the cage fuck it i'm
done with analogies like a flamingo hope
to god that works
[Music]
okay we got nothing to tell you man
these are flawless
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
training's good trainees are going well
in your laps and stuff like that heck
yeah and stuff like that yeah
[Music]
were you supposed to feel it yeah
[Music]
the next exercise we'll be doing is a
giant set of diverging lat pull down
it's actually from this line
in torture korean built equipment by the
most biomechanically advantageous
machines i've ever used in my life zero
joint stress you feel exactly you're
supposed to feel it in the muscle so
he's gonna be doing a diverging lat pull
down normally as a lat pull down
on this exercise so it's very similar uh
just better so giant sets we've
discussed giants here before
hello mike israel
that's that
fuck yeah
[Music]
seven let's get to ten at least
eight
[Music]
12.
[Music]
thirteen two more chest stop
big chest in there
fourteen chest come on one more
[Music]
there you go good
fifteen big big there you go there you
go much better
[Music]
yes
big chest at the bottom even if it
doesn't want to do it yes
[Music]
big chest everyone needs you perfect
don't let your chest come down as you
get to the bottom
big chest better
[Music]
better oh yeah
[Music]
there you go
like a butterfly
we're here for the last back exercise
for ak which is the smith machine
bent over row
otherwise called the
machine
as promulgated by its inventor
in the comments what's up dog we love
you
um
this is
a great tool one of the many tools in
toolbox is highly effective it's like a
barbell row you got to set your feet
right get everything good and then it's
just another variation that's uh really
really awesome get asked the question a
lot of how does this compare to the
barbell it compares well you know like
how does rice compare to pasta it's fine
all good foods so big dog here's got to
eat let's get it done
oh sets of uh
10ish 5 to 15 reps and uh his back's
already super pumped let's uh finish off
the job
six
seven two more
that's it that's it that's it that's it
that's failure very good
take a break we'll do another set here
and we'll do a down set with lighter
weight
good stuff when your arms are that long
and your waist is so small the range of
motion is crazy
try not to
i'm saying don't drink into it so you're
here it looks really good and then
you're like
oh yeah you know what i'm saying so it
should just be big chest
once you have to do this
to get it up you're done okay
let's lower the weight now back
chest up at the bottom chest up just up
yes full stretch yes
good
big stretch chest up
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
yep keep that chest sky high
whole back exercise good
[Applause]
good big chest
oh yeah
two more
one more fixture technique arch
okay
that's it good
very good
those look really good but like i don't
think you hit enough lats you know we
should probably
change
your whole body
so you can get more laughs you're doing
everything wrong it looks great in the
bent row
one of the challenges that your back
gets tired
and then not only does your lower back
start to round even if you have a lower
back rounding you can get this thing
where everything even your upper back
rounds and you start rolling like this
what you want to do is focus especially
on the bottom of keeping your chest up
and then letting your shoulders come
down at the same time not chest down
chest up and shoulders down
stretches the living shit out of your
back and you come in your chest to still
up everything crunches that big stretch
is what grows a ton ton ton of muscle
and it separates the bent room from a
lot of machine rows other exercises but
you can't really do that as well
it's challenging to present overload on
this exercise while simultaneously
maintaining excellent technique because
when the shit gets hard enough you're
like fuck this i'm just gonna move
around but what separates folks who get
the highest stimulus to fatigue ratios
from ones who get lower ones is the fact
that they can keep technical proficiency
as the intensity rises give it a shot at
home make sure you're under supervision
and your parents sign off on your waiver
good one
two
chest up
[Applause]
go go go three one more
last one
and slow and that's it good stuff
[Music]
good stuff
awesome awesome awesome all right folks
aka trained so hard as mike fell off
in the shirt
big back and lats all spread it out
good session he's going to finish up a
little bit of shoulders and biceps

ready for that shit yet uh hey why don't
you take us out with some turn around

next time
peace
check this out
why am i using this handle
i would explain but you don't have a phd
in biomechanics you're not going to
understand this all right just pretend
it's like computer science shit ai
neural networks
watch
you row not like this you stupid
motherfucker
you row to your hip and rotate around
that shit like that
like this now common mistake is to jab
yourself on the dick don't do that
you're smarter than that you're a little
bit smart for that not quite smart
enough to understand biomechanics all

daily tip lat shit when i see you next
you better have the biggest fucking lats
of all time peace
