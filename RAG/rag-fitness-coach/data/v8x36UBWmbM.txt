oh yeah good start take a break this is
gonna be like workout every set to
failure
[Music]
hey folks I'm Dr Mike this is Jared
feather ifb Pro and this is Bryce Adams
hello and she has the unique distinction
of having the most followers on the only
fans platform and is the most liked
Creator on only fans which
is cool because now we have three top
only fans people in the same video at
the same time as you know Jared is the
most requested feet picks of all time
ever since he started on only fans
Jared's feet have been described as
Angelic as cathartic as Sublime you
won't see them here because y'all
motherfuckers gonna have to pay for that
yeah I can't swear on the algorithm but
in any case me everyone knows this old
news you're the most liked person or
only fans and I feel that I'm the most
loved person and only fans there's like
a secret love emoji that you open up for
5.99
the the gentleman just sprayed me with
love in any case my doctor said it was
called something else and not love but
outside of that we are gonna do a smash
and grab total leg workout minus calves
and who trains calves anyway they don't
need those
we are gonna do hamstrings
we are gonna do glutes and the quads you
don't do quads they do you back yeah
yeah what do you think your chances are
of having just a magical fun time with
no tears no vomiting no uh rolling on
the floor in your own spot
like zero but it's still gonna be a
magical time magical time anyway Joe
yeah any parting thoughts uh let's just
get to the thing same time now
[Music]
all right folks
Bryce's first exercise is going to be
the good morning it is also Sunday
morning when we're recording this it's
about to be a bad morning for her don't
tell her she can't hear this
good mornings hit the hamstrings and the
glutes and the lower back and the mid
back all at the same time and the way
you want them to hit the hamstrings most
is you're going to hinge at the hips
pushing the button back that way how
many only fans related jokes can we make
we'll see but it starts right now in any
case nothing you want to look for if
your knees bend a lot it turns mostly
into a glute movement where you've got
glutes coming up later don't you worry
so we're not mostly hamstrings which is
why we're going to take the knee and fix
it right in place soft lockout just
barely out of Lock and then all of the
movement comes from the hip when you
feel a painful stretch that's good
another big tip for good mornings is to
have it down to a predictable bar height
where you put it on the platform that
can tell you you're doing a standardized
range of motion it makes progression
really easy you don't have to second
guess yourself we're doing multiple sets
of five to ten repetitions eccentric
control is everything I'll come back in
a bit and tell you guys more stuff but
for now I just want to address one thing
why she got a mask on you feel me I'm
here with my real face this is ugly and
awful as it is what's the mass score
well I'm inclined to believe that she's
actually a crime fighting superhero in
her other job just can't show that shit
off it's like Batman and Robin except
she's Batman and Robin I never thought
that through let's go do exercises whoo
gotta pause let's pause that was pretty
good gotta pause slow slow pause
up two more like the lower back big just
full time
slow
doping slow
good one more big pause this time wait
for a second down there
slow
ly
[Music]
rap good job
I'm still finding my rhythm it's hard
I'm sweating it's not fair being a girl
is it technically Flawless good morning
on her second try ever how does uh
it could be like this impressive
impressive yeah it'll be hard it'll be
more range of motion but I think you
have the mobility flexibility for it so
sure sure
yeah a little less so here really pushed
exactly like I said up and back butt up
and back
your feet are yep exactly just like that
you're gonna feel a little more it's
gonna be hard
there you go
good
control control control
up excellent lower back side slow on the
way down back down
yeah there you go keep it going all day
slow slower slower
[Music]
a couple more there's a tight lower back
got this you got it
slow he's back he's back he's back yes
all Bryce that was the best one Gentle
Touch you want to touch it as gently as
possible slow
gentle up
one more and you're done
make it good slow there's no rush slow
slow back up
good back very good very good all right
good enough let's go back on that
starting again she hasn't done good
mornings in a long time long time time
for more difficult things okay
two sets of good mornings in the tank
she hasn't trained her hamster usually
eccentric load in a while she hasn't
done good mornings in a long time so
we're gonna call it there we don't want
to do rhabdo type shit been training the
rest of the lower body more so now we do
front foot elevated dumbbell lunges the
front foot elevation is to hit the
glutes more because it puts the front
Loop which is the one that's stretched
under an even greater stretch the key
with this exercise is to use the front
foot to produce almost all the power and
the back foot is just there for balance
and support in addition to that you want
to make sure that you do a slow
eccentric movement gently touch the knee
to the ground
potentially take a pause and then come
back up
you do one leg you rest a little bit you
do the other leg you rest a little bit
and so on and so forth
sets of cheap probably 10 to 20 here
this is going to be painful the number
one requirement is the technique has to
stay good even during the pain that's a
recurring theme in many of our videos
technique is the foundation on top of
that you layer a good repetitions all of
them are with good technique slow
control
up go yep go damn you yes more more
slow
Patrol you're doing amazing gentle up
up one more
this is gonna be tough nobody said easy
you got this slow and gentle slow easy
up
go one more last one right now no rest
slow slow slow
up
[Laughter]
good stuff
that was excellent failure because your
Technique never broke down and you just
couldn't do it at some point that was
awesome take a little break keep
yourself strapped in and we'll switch
legs okay anything like this where your
grip can become limiting factor it's
smart to strap up every back session
every straight leg deadlift
every lunge anything where you're
holding on to something for a while
really controlling eccentrics
why take
the target muscle
and make it the forearms you can just do
extra forearm work so if you're really
trying to hit the back really trying to
hit the hamstrings or glutes whatever it
is the shoe straps it's there's no point
having an ego about that kind of thing I
still see people training back without
them especially and it's like
and you could just actually Target the
back by using straps not having the
forearms is a limiting factor
session is going to go way better
keep it up slow slow slow slow up
all right
hey that was great I keep thinking I'm
gonna do it too oh yeah technique
that was awesome
let's strap it on
yeah you guys ever done strap-on work
before any strap-on yeah
I find it fun it's hilarious it's like I
don't know it's a I think it's probably
like a little Power Trip thing
powered up I didn't expect to like it as
much as I did yeah yeah it's like
exactly lunges but in reverse the lunges
fuck you over instead of the other way
good job let's get one more here one
more you got this
slow control Gentle Touch
stand up all right okay get rid of the
dumbbells put them off to the sides
back to our 10 dumbbells switch legs you
got this go go go go time is of the
essence feel free to have your hands out
tell balance
yes up one more slow
slow
one more down right away down slow
up
switch legs relax for a second something
to hit her with
so let's actually balance with this slow
control
yep up up
again come on
slow
control
go
go again where's your fucking super go
slow front leg gentle
push
stop thank you
fucking great
it's like a good kind of hurt yeah the
house love having done it in the moment

[Music]
High bar squats you got this thing on
your back you're probably closer grip
because your arms are not the size of
your legs
and what you're going to do is keep your
chest upright you're going to tilt your
hips back and then your knees are going
to go nice and far forward so you're
sitting a little bit back and then down
heel stay down you stay upright sit all
the way down super deep okay your heels
stay on the ground at all times okay
knees are forward your chest is up you
pause for one Split Second and then you
stand up athletically go down slow under
control pause stand up athletically and
