can't think of too many things that set
up failure more than the early morning
run BS if you're cutting into your sleep
if even from a physiological perspective
it's stupid for fat loss why exactly are
we running that early in the morning
what ends up happening is as the weeks
go by you skip a couple sessions you
realize you like sleep more and you just
get out of the Habit because you really
designed a habit that was the hardest
possible thing to do at the worst
possible time and it's kind of designed
to fail ideally Fitness habits are easy
and very integratable into your life in
early morning runs are the opposite
opposite opposite of all that it can
work for you and I'm super happy it does
if it does but this is a terrible
mistake a ton of people make
