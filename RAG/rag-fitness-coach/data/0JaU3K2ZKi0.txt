what did you hear that
is that a new thing that just blew me
away i was about to do my normal thing
they they must have had a lawsuit or
something from
like stupid assholes who are like naked
on camera and don't know they're being
recorded
like somebody tried to sue or some
stupid shit like that oh man
i'm out of the loop on that one folks
it's good to be back this meeting is
being recorded
for your viewing pleasure apparently dr
james dr
mike we're here to answer your filthy
questions dr mike how's it going
i'm at a point in my mass phase when no
food sounds good
oh yeah been there but i'm also 250 with
veins in my abs which is
interesting to look at never been there
that's a cool problem to have
it's an interesting problem um
life is good life is good um
i'm looking at youtube's recommendations
from like shit i should be looking at i
just want to like
hurt myself um
but anyway i'm ready to go if you are
yeah yes my um
my dog hammerfest just got spay and she
has a big cone on her head and she just
came in like
conked into the door and was like cock
lady both my dogs have figured out how
to use the cone as a weapon that was
like both of them transitioned into
battle mode immediately they just become
battering rams and they
they hit the cat with it all the time
and he's like get away from me and
they're like bam bam bam bam like
the cone is actually an impressive
defensive and offensive weapon for a dog
like you no longer can get the dog's
neck which is the number one way of
winning a fight
and also if you try to go through the
front you get bit it's either you get
bit or stabbed with plastic or you can't
get through the plastic so the point is
fucking sweet what they'll do too is
they'll like
they'll like uh pin people pin the other
animals against the wall
and then bite
and she's still like it's kind of
zombie-ish so like she goes in and out
of being high and so she's just like
coding she's that's why i was sorry i
was distracted she's just like
all right up first
is the great
the wise the incredible david g
who has also been described as a g
pulling in
59 up votes my god
can tendons and other soft tissues get
stronger a while on a calorie deficit
the answer to that is in most cases yes
but the rate of strengthening
significantly declines and if you
already have super super strong
soft tissues and tendons and you do a
real nasty deficit
there is a chance that that any progress
can flatline
or even you can experience a slight loss
in integrity
but if you're a beginner or intermediate
you can absolutely get increases so it's
nothing to worry about
but it just happens slower so the case
in point here
i think some people would want to sort
of derive something from this that i
don't want them to
it is like hey i just i used to get this
question all the time james probably did
too
i'm uh scheduled to have reconstructive
surgery on my knee somebody just two
months
just can i just can i do a cut like well
you see
robbing your body of nutrients is not
the best way to heal it's not fastest
there's a chance it won't heal
completely
and a greater chance that more
complications will result so the only
correct answer
to surgical recovery is maintenance only
ever
maintenance now of course there's always
nuance it's never only but it's fucking
99
i swear to god james yeah absolutely so
one thing that's kind of unique about um
some of your connective tissues is that
they're very very responsive to
tension stimulus very much like your
muscles are
but probably uh to a greater degree in
some cases so
what we find is that the best way to
strengthen up some of those um
connective tissues like your tendons
ligaments and even and your bones
especially
is to put them under some some serious
loads now
the problem that you run into here with
the calorie deficit is you know
using heavier and heavier loads as you
increase your calorie deficit further
and further
becomes less and less practical so not
coincidentally if you've seen a lot of
our kind of
block level periodization stuff we
generally recommend especially on a cut
that you kind of start with your heavier
stuff in the beginning of the cut and
then kind of work your way towards
lighter weights towards the end
not only from a fatigue management
standpoint but also for
at least not for nothing from an injury
prevention standpoint because
you're less and less able to tolerate
those heavy loads so during a cut you
might see some adaptation in kind of the
early on the first couple mesos
and then towards the end it might kind
of stale you just kind of just not see
any
no change from that point on just
because you're you might not be using
enough load
regularly to see those types of
adaptations anymore
boom next up
is janahan logan
what is this a star thought yeah i mean
that's clearly something
wait j.a eric what the fuck
that's an anathan logana fan all right
okay
when you come to the end of a deload
week and you still feel drained either
mentally or physically should you
continue with your plan meso
and then take an active rest phase or
cut that meso
i would say you should continue to
deload until you feel better and then
start your meso after
yeah i think that's a great
recommendation and you know you could
depending on how long your active rest
phase your deload
you know if you take like a one week of
active rest is that really active rest
or is that like a longer deload it's
somewhere in between both
so um yeah i agree with mike i kind of
feel like
and mike and i have had this
conversation a thousand times in our own
personal and just you know personal
stuff but it's there's always
you can always find a reason not to
carry on with your current plan now
sometimes you have good reasons not to
but if you feel like shit here's the
kicker
are you supposed to feel like shit and
if the answer is you're supposed to feel
like shit right now and that's part of
the plan then you keep going and you
kind of have to put some reasonable
upper and lower bounds on that
but if you're like in you know meso two
of
three during a cut like yeah you're
probably going to feel kind of shitty
deload the best that you can take a
little bit of extra time if you need to
but stay the course don't think that you
have to just
abandon ship and take active rest and
start over that's usually not the right
way to do it
all right tony sudall
what are your thoughts on reverse
dieting is there any actual evidence
studies that it works if not
how come how does one come out of a cut
uh slash maintenance to a mass phase
okay so we can actually clear this up a
lot of the terms here are
weird and yeah different than they used
to be
um or just confusing reverse dieting
itself is confusing
doesn't really tell you anything about
the nature of the sort of calorie
position
um so there
is essentially you have kind of two
options after
a fat loss phase and they're dependent
on how
lean you are and where you want to go if
you
just finished a contest prep and or you
finished a nice solid fat loss phase and
you want to
continue to mass afterwards to put our
muscle you go right into a surplus
now people get freaked out here because
they're like oh my god i was eating 4
000 calories and at the end of my diet i
was eating 2 500 does that mean i go
back up to 4 000 no
you go to based on your current
metabolism and your previous metabolism
you sort of have to average the two to
see what a surplus is going to be so the
easiest way to do this
if you used to eat 4 000 calories for a
decent clip of mass gaining back when
you were heavier
and at the end of your last week or last
28 2500 calories whatever let's say it's
3 000 for you mathematical ease
3000 is what you ate at the end of the
fat loss phase what do you go to to mass
after for that same decent clip i would
just say you
average the two numbers and divide by
two so 3 500 calories
right between the two it's not four
thousand it's not three thousand thirty
five hundred and see how it goes and
then maybe your metabolism will adapt
really quickly and you won't gain really
any weight and you'll have to just
iteratively increase your
massing calories like you would normally
or you do gain some decent weight until
you have to eat more than 3 500
and then eventually beating 4 000
eventually 4 250 or something cause
you're bigger than ever so and so forth
so that's my best advice if you want to
continue to mass after
now there are thoughts there are times
when you just want to maintain and
here's a great one
somebody lost from 200 to 180 and they
have no intention of ever being 200
again
they're not training with weights for
the first time they're eating really
well if they want to stay 180 and
actually they want to be 160.
now we all know you can't just go to 160
from 200 you have to probably take a
maintenance phase
so then you immediately go to
maintenance right and then
how do you just figure out your
maintenance well you take your old
maintenance
you take your last week of cutting
calories
and you interpolate equidistantly
between the two so if your
previous maintenance was 3 500 and then
your end of cut calories
was 2500 then your next week to
maintenance first guest
is like 3 000. it's a fine guess and
it'll
never be accurate so don't you dare go
and try to look up formulas and also
should be like oh i want it exact it
won't oh man there is no possibility of
that exactness
james will finish that off for me once
i'm done ranting um and just
cut the difference between the two and
start
and then you can make all the
adjustments in the world you're not
gonna regain five pounds of fat in a
fucking week
it's never gonna happen so stay calm and
that's it so that is literally the
extent
of actual reverse dieting uh
the early idea of reverse diet i don't
think anyone really subscribes to
anymore
is let's say 2500 calories is a 500
calorie deficit for you and you finish
that with the end of the diet
early reverse dieting would say okay
next week you do 2600 and then 2700 and
then 2800 so it's less and less of a
deficit every time
that's the analogy i like to use to
dispute that is to say okay if you wake
up
in bed and there's a fire right next to
you do you run out of the house
and stop the burn or do you roll over an
inch or two and see if the fire is a
little better
you're still in the fire but less but
you're still fucking burning you're just
burning less you don't want to burn less
you want to stop burning
so as soon as your deficit is done
finish the deficit either go to
maintenance like we just described
or go to mass like we described before
that there's no as soon as the deficit
is over that deficit is over the diet is
over the deficit is over
james yeah no uh you are
making a point about the calculations
and that's something that kind of drives
me nuts because a lot of people
try to find all these quirky
calculations or saying like you should
be increasing by xyz amount but
ultimately at the end
like mike said you kind of have your
numbers that you have you have
historical data that you can fall back
on and
very often splitting the historical with
the current is a great way to start
and then ultimately after that it is
guest and check like doesn't matter how
many fucking calculators you use you're
going to have to look at what you're
eating
and what the scale says it doesn't
matter it's the same thing like when
you're starting a diet how much calorie
should i be starting my diet at i don't
fucking know
you can use a calculator but that's just
gonna it's just like throwing a dart in
the dark hoping that you stick somewhere
that's it
you're still gonna have to wait and
still gonna have to um see where it goes
and i think i think the reverse dieting
as you said right in the beginning mike
there's been so many changes as to what
that means
it's very confusing for people so
they'll they'll probably just do a quick
google search and say reverse dieting
calculator
how much should i be adding data and
it's just needless because at the end of
the day
you're going to have to add some back
how much it's hard to say and it's
probably
pointless in trying to calculate some
level of precise number of calories just
because like the
the user error is so massive anyways
you're like okay well i need to add
170 calories back per day motherfucker
your margin of error is like plus or
minus
50 right so don't even worry about it
just start you know and start somewhere
reasonable and that's kind of
one of the reasons why dr mike and i are
usually big on just having some kind of
i use this term broadly but like we call
it a testing and monitoring program
where it's just like
don't just think that the calculator is
going to solve it you still have to just
put in the work and monitor what you're
doing and that might be as simple as
just looking at your body weight and
using myfitnesspal boom
great place to start yep
yep i'm actually looking at excuse me
shit shit ah i should have said the rp
diet app fuck shameless plug
i missed missed a golden opportunity
there fucking idiot how are we supposed
to make ah i'm a shill for my fitness
pal no i hate them they're actually like
the bane of my coaching existence
[Music]
all right um this is the first
result uh in google is precision
nutrition reverse dieting
uh smart bodybuilders slowly reverse
there yeah sure uh let's see if i have
anything
on my screen that is bad
so look at that's always a good good
good to check
uh yeah yeah you have to because you
know last time i had like some foreign
tabs off and some guy was like yeah duck
porn like hey fucking idiot of course i
jack off
i watch porn hey why don't you put your
screen up and we can make fun of the
weird fucking
anime porn you jack off to you piece of
shit whoever you were i don't remember
who you were there's nothing wrong with
jacking off to anime by the way
so you know i dabble in that every now
and again you know what i'm saying i was
actually before we got on i was talking
about how i used to
uh fantasize uh and masturbate to
thoughts of bulma because i thought bomb
was really hot and i was like 14. made
her
unnecessarily hot yeah and then also
like i used to jack off thinking about
her and then i saw like the whole namic
saga with the frog
and i was like we're done balm and i are
done i hope she dies remember before
they even get there it's like her and
krillin just like
adventuring in outer space and they go
to like the wrong planet you think it's
namic for like five episodes no just
kidding it's a weird planet that's not
named
interesting it's like the show producer
was like hey hey rogers or hey
tanaki listen though we need like we
have this extra show happening on our
channel you need to buffer the shit
series by four episodes he's like where
did i put it for episodes like make
something up
literally what happened okay so we'll
end the anime porn rant but really quick
one of the best things about the
internet is you can just search your
whatever show it is and then say like
which
episodes to skip jesus christ is that a
lifesaver
if i would have known that i would have
never watched all all of dragon ball z
fuck that nonsense jared feather is
currently working through dbz because
he's never like seen it seen it before
he'd seen what
in there it's like 75 filler
but i was like jared there's a lot of
filler he's like nope nope i'm doing my
due diligence so like
he like walked out of the office and i'm
like how is it he's like dude
ball man the frog and i'm like there's
like six more episodes of that
okay they actually so this is god i'm
sorry for wasting our time on this but
there's a there's a couple there's a
there's a website that ranks anime and
in terms of their filler to like content
ratio
um and some of them are really bad so
i've been watching naruto
uh the the latter one and it's like 41
filler and i just discovered that you
can just search these guides
and it's a lifesaver because it's like a
thousand episodes or whatever so you
just
just say like which episodes to watch
and they say skip here go back here skip
here
boom amazing technology
oh look at this stuff here we go so okay
caloric intake is this dotted line uh
reverse dieting
caloric intake
uh yeah so okay this conception would be
wrong
not to shit on precision they're great
but like here's the problem
let's let's this is there's a clearly
mislabel here or lack of label
there should be a deficit surplus off
lag right
like where's eucaloric line i'm going to
say since they started here and
dropped like this maybe a metabolic
adjustment says it's like right here
right okay right here so anything under
this from here to here
is a fucking gigantic mistake so you
need to go ah
and then the rest of it can look like
that that's basically what i was trying
to say
all right so thank you for that internet
and let us go to the next youtube
question which is
by getting weighed
getting
oh getting's not good enough
what because there's a lot of getting
oh getting weighed there we go i wasn't
sure if it was going to be like a
a whey protein pun there like getting
right right
or a weight getting way yeah uh oh
that's not the
so same user but different questions oh
son of a bitch
yeah this one's getting new fuck you
wade
by the way i i saw the uh deadpool
uh avatar so getting weighed yeah
i got you i got you bro
all right question a lot of folks do
like the classic templates like
juggernaut and 531
especially trainees who mostly just have
access to a barbell how would you
approach modifying these templates
to align them between the scientific
principles um
to align them between with the
scientific principles of hypertrophy
like you know there's a bunch of ways
you could do this i would say three
things
add accessory volume um dope out the
volume relative to your abilities not
just
same volume every week so increase or
decrease volume based on someone's
perception blah blah
and recovery and lastly i would say you
could probably run them for like four or
five weeks on and one week down
so four to one five to one paradigm as
opposed to like three to one which is
kind of a
bit of a waste of time so those are my
three james what do you think
yeah so i think the juggernaut one is
probably the most
easily modified because at that point
it's just a matter of like dialing in
your volume landmarks and that might be
just a matter of using like down sets on
some exercises
maybe increasing some of the baseline
sets for some people that's like a
pretty easy fix
531 you kind of have to do a bit more of
an overhaul because essentially
it's a fine program but it's more of a
if i had to pick a term for it i would
say it's more of a peaking program than
anything
yeah because it's just like max effort
low volume kind of stuff um
so that one you would really have to
kind of revamp significantly in terms of
adding not have the patience to add
actual strength if i threw one in peak
every month
exactly uh so that one would need a
little bit of just
at that point i would you know i i think
you would probably have better success
just reading the hypertrophy book and
starting a new
then trying to adapt five through one
now if that's what you got and that's
what you're working with that's fine
i would say um if you're using 531
as mike said think about adding
accessory lifts think about adding maybe
more frequency
per week per muscle group um things
along those lines and of course like so
some of it applies to all of it like
volume landmarks you know across both of
those 531
you might want to dial back the amount
of amrap sets that you do
um that's probably not something you
should be doing
maybe at all just gonna throw that out
there yeah um that's an easy fix though
yep all right next up is cade howell
kade and wade got rhyming back to back
where are you at cade it says uh it's
with a k
ah gotcha
boom kade says mind muscle connection
seems to decrease towards the later
weeks
of a mezzo as i'm using heavy loads and
pushing closer failure do you guys
notice the same thing in your own
training
would you say it's better to opt to
option to prioritize my muscle
connection a bit more if that means
progressing load
less aggressively yes for hypertrophy
yes for strength no
um for hypertrophy definitely you don't
want to jump loads in such a way that
you're like i don't even know what's
going on i'm just moving at this point
your stimulus to fatigue ratio is going
to suck so i would say
load progressions should be done very
unaggressively in general hypertrophy
training
and it's one of those things uh there's
a video series actually you can look up
it's in the rp thing it's uh training
quality versus quantity i think if you
do that and it's retail or
rp it'll come up we basically say like
training quantity is a super important
variable only
and ever after training quality has been
taken care of
and good technique proximity to failure
and a mind muscle connection
is a super important thing to always
have and if your load progressions are
fucking up your mind muscle connection
go back and load and do the shit over
again um
so like they're in and it is actually
possible
to progress and load and still have a
great mind muscle connection
but you just might have to put five
pounds on the bar versus another ten
never let your technique slip never let
your mind muscle connection slip it's
going to be harder to keep a mind muscle
connection just because of more systemic
accumulated fatigue
that you can't avoid uh but definitely
don't ever
another way of asking this question is
should i sacrifice my muscle connection
for putting more load on the bar phrased
that way which logically is the same
question
is of course not right like oh i don't
really feel my biceps anymore but i
think i'm still curling it's like
[Music]
you don't want to do that for
hypertrophy you don't want to do that
james
yeah so i totally agree with dr mike the
only reason you might have caught me
being a little apprehensive there is
because
um i think that
sometimes people i'm just going to say
it as plainly as i can
i think sometimes people use like mind
muscle connection as a way of pussifying
their training sometimes
yeah and i mean that i don't mean that
to be like condescending but i can see
i see a lot of times where people will
just be like oh this shit's getting hard
oh i'm not like fee i don't i'm going to
go by feel i'm going to see how you do
my field training
and that is just like you have to look
at yourself in the mirror and be like am
i kind of like you know pussifying my
training a little bit
yeah i think i am should i be adding
weight on the bar especially if it's
something like a big movement like an
sldl or a bench press like yeah probably
like okay
you know lateral raises ah maybe maybe
not because the weight jumps are hard
like
bicep curls same problem but like big
movements like a deficit deadlift
good morning squat bench press like
should you add weight to the bar to keep
the rirs in the in the goal rep range
yeah the thing is too mike i don't know
if you've noticed this
with your training but like um i've
noticed like i can add like two and a
half pounds per week on like let's say a
barbell lunge
you don't even notice that it's there
and then you've been you
three measures of training 15 weeks you
know that's a lot of weight that you've
added and each time like you barely even
notice that it's changed
granted like a lunge is you know like a
lot of muscle mass but you kind of get
the idea like you can add just a little
bit every time and it's basically a drop
in the bucket
and you're still progressing in load
which is sweet so don't use the system
my
my point here is i agree with what mike
said completely but i just i
see this happen a lot where people are
maybe they have a bad day at the gym and
they're like yeah i'm just doing too
heavy i got to go back to training by
field it's like
yeah maybe but here's actually a really
interesting alternative that i've
employed on a number of occasions
you have a session where you go up and
wait and it just feels off you're like
oh i'm just trying to move the weight i
can't feel my muscles
don't go down and wait next week repeat
the same weight yes yes
and try to really focus and maybe even
your reps will go down but then you have
a real high quality session and then
next week you go up and wait by a little
bit again
that's it a lot of times when guys say
oh i have to drop my mind muscle
connection
to do this weight it's not the weight
it's the weight end reps like yeah if
you had to do nine stiff legged
deadlifts at this weight you might have
to have a shitty mmc just to get it done
you might be able to do seven with a
great mmc and then get really close to
failure
in that case seven's all you got and by
then you might have actually hit your
mrv
and here's another thing i'm going to
say decreasing your mind muscle
connection and thus the technique that
you're using
while trying to increase load and quote
unquote hit the same reps is a great way
of completely masking the fact that you
have exceeded your mrv and you're still
trucking along
like you hit your mrv and biceps two
weeks ago and what you call a curl
isn't really a curl anymore what are you
doing the worst of all possible worlds
including a very high injuries so uh yes
and it's funny because
you have unconsciously changed your
specificity of training at that point to
strength training not hypertrophy
yes yes super super important point
all right craig fergie is up
next boy fergie
oh it's just i don't know what i was
expecting in terms of fergie being
spelled but that
that tickled me a little bit yeah yeah
fergie
hey guys i'm a guy with a with pretty
wide hips and a narrow waist
what else maybe that's kidding but if we
were in jail i would say hello to you
or club or club or just out in the
street you know
saying we're out here uh it's like why
jail
why restrict myself to good looking men
only in prison
i could easily have them in the wild so
um
is there anything i can do about this
hypertrophy wise to improve aesthetics
thanks
uh yeah but like get enormous shoulders
enormous chest enormous back and that
sure doesn't hurt matters
and get as lean as you can
you could like transition
that would be sweet because then you'd
have like the perfect build i'm just
kidding
uh consider being female yeah no there's
not really much you can do
with with your build it doesn't matter
what builds you have right you kind of
just built with whatever you got
um you can certainly like fill in weak
spots and maybe take time off of ones
that are already super strong um
i don't really have much kind of like dr
mike said like you can always get bigger
everywhere else and kind of fill in
those gaps
but you got what you got yeah what you
got you look great
um you know this is terrible i'm not
even gonna say it oh yeah i'll say it
you know when you have kids uh you're
gonna have some really hot daughters
that's all i'm trying to say
if if it holds so
um all right uh next up
is the handy-dandy note jeremy
bata but uh
jeremy got it
if someone is planning a show prep what
training week deload intro overreaching
should they learn about the show week
uh really easy answer the answer is
deload
so actually what you do is the first
half of the week is usually
uh pretty difficult trading but much
less volume so that you don't get sore
so when you start your carb up halfway
through that week you do nothing or
almost nothing and it works out really
well so deload is really the only
correct answer
anything else is a really really bad
idea the worst of which is overreaching
because then overeating causes
subcutaneous water to be stored in your
muscles and prevents them from taking up
as much glycogen
which give you the uh all-time worst
look you could ever have
yeah no totally agreed uh all right
next up is
okay adventures
ooh sounds nice it's ed
ventures all one word oh
got it boom all right
adventures says
trying to move my zoom screen
hypertrophy question
colin i like that he uh he has to he has
to note that it's average of the
question is that such things are alien
to this channel
uh i was just fucking with the
adventures you know you know we love you
if i lower the weight on my fourth set
in order to be able to hit my target rep
ranges that consider junk volume not
necessarily
should i just stick to doing three sets
with the original weight used
um if you have to
so it's not necessarily junk volume but
it starts to
risk a little bit more if you keep doing
that um
if the weight is still above roughly 30
of your fresh one rep max you're good to
go
if the weight is below then that's not
great and you should probably not do
that
um also there's a bit of a tracking
difficulty that results there i would
consider not doing that unless you
really have to
i would just stick to um you know
so if i lower my weight on my fourth set
in order to be able to hit my target rep
range
um this is the downside at that point
it's a down set and you could just start
doing down
sense uh also you know target rep ranges
are probably wildly overdone
as we say on here a lot of times if it's
north of roughly five reps per set it's
still quality set
so a lot of people are like you know i
do 13 11
10 and then i have to do a downside
because i can't get nine like nine's a
fine number
your target is the 10 to whatever range
so generally speaking it's not a big
deal either way
and then just keep this in mind too
usually we say per
exercise per session you're kind of
looking at like
you know around a top end of five sets
per exercise you know before you would
maybe think about moving on to adding
more exercises if you need more volume
so you're essentially hitting three
sets at the you know target weight and
then moving into down sets
i think ideally you would probably want
to be progressing more
in your target sets and then adding down
sets as needed just because those target
sets are going to be more stim
they're just heavier at that point
they're going to be a little bit more
stimulative
so and this is a mistake that i had made
me in the past when i was playing around
with down sets where i would
add a lot of down sets and then at the
end of the day you kind of realize like
well which sets are actually the best
bang for my buck well it's probably the
heavier ones or at least the ones that
i'm doing first in the session
so i would consider even if even if you
have to
lighten the weight up because maybe
you're like in the maybe you're starting
with the 5 to 10 rep range and you're
hitting like
six five and then you're like oh i don't
want to go below five reps now i'm going
to add down sets
maybe just pick a weight that you can
start at doing like eight
and maybe fill up more of those first
sets before adding
more down sets and that's perfectly fine
as well
yeah but don't be afraid of using the
downsides either i don't want to scare
you away from that that's
that's totally fine as dr mike said even
if you kind of get out of the
the rep range as long as it's not like
these massive massive massive deviations
i
i don't see it being a problem either

here we go is there an alternative to
many cuts for continuing mass phase how
do you know when to stop gaining and
start a maintenance phase into a cut
i'm currently 3.5 months into my first
ever intentional mass gain phase
it's been amazing on so many levels i'm
5'3 went from 126 to 132
i'm starting to get to my high end range
of body fat comfort but still want to
prioritize muscle growth this year
before doing a cut in the late summer to
fall i watched your video mini cuts and
listen to the two rp podcast somebody
cuts well very good you're way ahead of
the game
it sounded like many cuts could be a
good option if i were more advanced
given my still relative noob status what
would you recommend
should i sit at maintenance for a while
and then keep gaining no
i want to make sure i keep that
motherfucking skyscraper potential and
not bomb
out uh the scaffolding i built the last
several months
my tentative plan when i started this
was to mass till july
then slow cut till november uh my
sister's getting married in mexico so
hoping to be relatively lean by then
uh p.s thanks for answering my question
questions docs i plan to do the week
pass at dragon's lair
so i'll be in vegas for nine days thanks
for the advice i'm a low
back and i'm flying and training while
i'm there
um super oh
don't get bit by the dragon he tends to
be feisty especially midday
um other than that uh
the alternative to a mini cut is
generally a longer cut
that lasts six weeks to ten weeks which
you sort of clean up completely
i think you are a fine candidate for
many cuts and should do like a
three-week meeting cut no problem get
back to massing finish up and then start
your diet for
your uh sister's wedding was it
uh yeah
uh that's my best advice mini cut's fine
uh you're
there's no you know you seem to have a
very good grasp on the concepts here so
mini cutting
and you know what you're doing mini
cutting for one of the reasons we say
mini cutting is for the advanced is
because
any time we talk about mini cutting with
general pop we get inundated by people
who just want to have the same results
as with cutting but
do less work so they go as many cutting
for me and the answer is no it's not
so you are sufficiently advanced to
understand what mini getting is four
understands limitations you're not gonna
break any of your scaffolding no problem
so just do a two three week maybe three
week mini cut
get a little leaner and then finish out
the rest of your several weeks or months
i mean you you wrote this question
probably it was late
may so you said you wanted to mask till
july
uh i'd say that's a month extra of
massing you could just slow your rate of
gain and
get up to 134 and you'll be fine you'll
be at the very top of how fat you want
to be but good news
you're gonna be dieting uh till november
so you'll be super lean so you'd just be
a little fluffy for just a little while
and that's really not a big deal
so actually if i take your timeline
seriously don't mini cut just keep
massing
uh and just don't eat everything in
sight and gain to like your 134 135 and
you'll be totally straight
so i just want to point out uh look at
this tiny baby stoat video on my screen
share oh my god look at that that's so
cute
what is it a baby what it's stoked it's
like a little ferret
weasel kind of thing oh he's adorable
he's pretty delicious
yeah um so i agree with dr mike here uh
one thing i would just caution you
especially
since it's your first kind of official
crack at a mass
what you don't want to do on your first
mass is get to a place where you feel
unhappy about how you look because then
you're always going to have reservations
about doing it again and then it's going
to be this like i need to get as lean as
possible because i feel terrible and ah
it just creates all this like this
madness
so if you're already at the top end of
kind of where your
your fluffy your fluffiness level i kind
of think the latter one that dr mike
recommended is a good suggestion is just
keep massing if if your training is
still going well and you're not showing
any signs of staleness or slowing down
on prs and stuff like that
i would say keep massing then
what you might consider is that you can
still do that slow cut
and then you might be able to take like
a significant portion of time
into maintenance before your sister's
wedding
so then you don't rebound and jabba back
out after all those margaritas and shit
in mexico which is another separate
issue but worth noting so what most
people will do is they'll do the long
slow cut
for somebody's event like their wedding
in this case and then they'll put like
30 pounds back on in a matter of weeks
from like just binging and going crazy
so you can just basically scoot your
timeline up a little bit
mass a few more mesos finish it out so
you're basically at that point where
you're like nah i'm i'm pretty much done
do your long cut until you get to the
place you want to be which in this case
will be well before the wedding
then you'll have some time to run
maintenance before the wedding and
mitigate a lot of the rebounding effects
from doing a
longer hard cut so i think that would be
a very good option
yeah yeah good thinking there's a lot of
like it's really good considering like
not just what you want out of this cut
or whatever but what about later
what about the next it's important
mm-hmm
absolutely all right
so kade howell again
that's very pertinent different kate
howell this time
boom there it is
yeah it is different he says did brad
schoenfeld's new study on rob change
your opinion on anything wrong related
the answer is no
because no one study changes our opinion
on anything so flat out the answers
but it's a very interesting study so
let's take a look uh
kate says it's made me second guess
calling a set quote-unquote failure
based on not being able to perform 100
full range of motion
on lat pulldowns for example i've always
called failure when i'm no longer able
to touch the part on my chest
but the other 90 of the movements still
feel strong with partial rom
specifically with the stretch portion
involved being shown to be quite
effective
uh maybe in one study we'll see if
that's replicated we don't know that yet
are we leaving gains on the table by
calling a set failure just because we
aren't able to get perfect standard
standardized reps through the entire set
so maybe maybe you are making a mistake
and maybe
that uh doing partials either the whole
time or after the set has been completed
is a really really good thing we'd have
to have direct literature multiple study
confirmation of that fact
uh but there's another problem
standardization counting
how exactly would you count those reps
now if you have like
let's say after you're done pulling it
to the chest you pull it to the chin
maybe that's a good idea maybe though
you just pull it to the chin to begin
with and you'd skip the chest all
together
um maybe that's a good idea we're not so
particularly sure
for now the most of the literature says
the full range of motion beats partials
uh is there a possibility that in some
exercises
the bottom eccentric stretch portion is
so much more hypertrophic
that doing the full range of motion
balances out the benefits of
sort of recruiting more of the motor
units across the whole muscle and
because basically the
top half of let's say the leg extension
is so much easier and less stimulative
that going through the full range of
motion means you do bottom half on top
half just kind of wasting a lot of
energy on that top half and you could
have gotten more bottom half reps
and if you can't do the top half anymore
maybe you could have still done a
whole lot more bottom half reps maybe
that's the case i would say we need to
reserve judgment on that for the time
being
if you do want to do some partials at
the bottom end range have a
logical cutoff of range of motion and
then what is failure and then go try
that
because just pulling to a certain degree
is going to be really weird because what
is failure then when you can't move the
bar at all
i predict that the stimulus to fatigue
ratio of that is going to be awful
because completely inability to provide
concentric movement at all is such a
hugely fatigue thing probably is not
uh well supported for how much growth
you get out of it
so can you do these things yes i
wouldn't say
we need to second-guess anything just
yet what i would say
the schonfeld study might show
is that if you do the top half of a
movement only
you're probably fucking wasting your
time because we now have some
maybe sense of evidence that the bottom
part is more hypertrophic even than full
rom
but we do have evidence from prior
studies of two things one full rom beats
partial bomb almost every time
especially the easy part of partial on
the top end and also the fact that
stretch under load
has been a very well explored very well
embedded mechanism for hypertrophy
knowing those two things if you're gonna
skip anything it better not be that
bottom part
uh it'd be at least full range of motion
if not accentuated at the bottom
accentuate the bottom though is an
interesting proposition
if you have a way to track it feel free
to try it definitely get a way to track
it and also you don't have to try it yet
because another study could come out and
say actually full rom
in other exercises under different
conditions or even the same study
repeated
these partials and we'll all be feeling
real stupid for having done the bottom
part of whatever don't ever let
any one study tell you shit about shit
you need
many many studies from different
perspectives to build a whole case we
already have that
so far the case is yeah full range of
motion usually beats all covers
and i'm sticking with that until proven
otherwise with potentially
remembering to really accentuate a deep
stretch at the bottom
which just in just in case um it has
been unsaid
i'm sure it's built out and elsewhere uh
some people try to say the study is
giving credit to bros for quote unquote
knowing this all along i don't know a
single fucking cocksucker bro
that does the bottom end of a movement
accentuated they usually do the middle
range where they can lift the most
weight because their egotistical pieces
shit
or the top end range where they can
simultaneously lift a lot of weight
even the most weight and also not have
to feel the burden and embarrassment of
going down in your lower
uh and the joint stress and all that
other stuff so generally speaking
almost nobody trains like this i think
john meadows has an exercise where you
do a full hack squat
down halfway up full down all the way
back up that's a neat idea that might
have some credence to it
it's a lot harder than the regular hack
squad so most people don't do it what do
they do instead they put bands on the
fucking hack squat
to make it easier at the bottom which is
precisely where it's most hypertrophic
pot shots on jared i feel it you just
took a shot at jared didn't you
jared feather didn't he just do like a
reverse hack squat
band thing on instagram so jared
so jared he did but he said it's because
like i think it was like variation i'm
kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding
yeah but no but he like he hates the
band hack squad thing
and we've showed up to dragon's lair a
bunch and there's like people leave the
bands on there and it's almost
impossible to take off
and it's like bans on hack squad is like
when people think they're smart
start to talk shit out of their ass they
have no idea what's going on and they're
like yeah man you come being resistance
man it matches the fucking force
profile blah blah blah and they've never
looked into hypertrophy mechanisms and
they're just fucking wrong
so that's a very exaggerated explanation
there's possibly some nuance there
but in any case yeah don't don't run too
far with this study
james yeah so full disclosure folks i
did not read this study yet so i can't
really comment on any of the
really really nitty-gritty details i
know they used a knee extension
and i think in this case it's kind of
interesting because i think
there are potential applications of
these kind of type of ideas
in isolation whereas i would kind of be
very skeptical of somebody to
say i'm going to apply this idea on
something like a squat first of all it's
very fucking difficult to even do that
consistently as dr mike said but then
again you're also limiting the amount of
tension and mind muscle connection you
can really hit on any one particular
thing
so in the knee extension you're really
just hitting that medial uh
quad muscle as as hard as you possibly
can at least in my case right you're not
really hitting much else it's just that
boom
that medial quad and um in this case it
might be one of those things where
yeah maybe you actually are getting an
accentuated mind muscle connection maybe
and then
dr mike we're talking and i were talking
earlier the knee extension is kind of a
unique thing because it puts it in a
very stretched position at the bottom
and you are simultaneously kind of
occluding that limb so you're causing it
to like
stretch and occlude at the same time in
that bottom
part of that range of motion which could
be like a really cool benefit that
you're taking advantage of so
maybe i think those effects are probably
more profound in isolation than they are
in like a compound situation like a
bench press or a squat or something like
that
but who knows so far what we know is
that
full range of motion is kind of hard to
bet against
so it's one of those like you have to
make a really really good case to say
we're not going to do full range of
motion the other thing that dr mike said
that i think is really compelling is
kind of
where is the it's um where does it end
in terms of tracking right because you
can take something like a lat pull down
for example and it's something you might
say
okay well normally i go to chest and now
i'm like at chin and then if it's above
chin then i don't really count it as a
full rep but then it's like okay well
do you have to even break at the elbow
for it to become a rep can you do
straight arm like lat shrugs down is
that a rep
how far do you take it and then it
becomes just a nightmare of
fatigue management in terms of training
to failure across multiple muscle groups
and like what did you actually do week
to week can you present a progressive
overload
or are you just like training beyond
failure to a point where
you have no idea what you're fucking
doing anymore which i tend to think is
that
so there's kind of what i would call and
dr mike and i used to drill this into
our temple kids heads
you kind of have like an operational
range of technique there's some
cues that we use for every exercise
which are general and kind of just broad
strokes
for something like a squat and then you
kind of individualize your technique
in there for the individual and even
within that you kind of have like an
effective range right
i know if i do a high bar squat can i
touch my ass to my heels
every single time sure if i am like an
inch or two away from that does that
mean that that's a failed rep
probably not it just means that you're
kind of like in that range of like
pretty close to full range of motion but
within the user end
uh range of reproducibility which is
such like a minutiae thing so
i would call that like an effective
range of technique where every rep
might not be fucking identical but as
long as you're not seeing these huge
gaps in like things like range of motion
it's probably
right on point so could you make a case
and say like you don't need to do
full rom every single time to have great
results like
yeah sure but there's a pretty strong
case for it so you're gonna have to make
a better case
against it in order for us to jump on
board yep 100
that better case that's tough to make so
yeah so like i i'm imagining this same
phenomenon if you put somebody on like a
biceps curl machine
i bet you if they did the same study and
they had like you know like you know
like preacher curl machine
and they did the exact same thing you
might see the same result and it might
just be because
that bottom end on the on an isolation
movement like that
might just be really a a cool mind
muscle connection stretch
loaded stretch like phenomenon that
people can take advantage of using a
machine
if you tried to do the same thing like
on a pull down or pull up i don't think
you would see that same result just
because there's so much more going on
it's hard to isolate any individual
muscle group and uh yeah so
it's interesting it's definitely
something that we'll keep an eye on but
full rom
remains for the time being yeah
folks that's all we got
well hot diggity damn um let's see
what's going on any housekeeping items
so i don't know folks if you have
checked recently or not but hey we got
some pretty good prices
on amazon so if you haven't picked up
any of our books yet
that you are might be interested in like
mini cup manual or
training for endurance or adolescents or
any of the cookbooks that we have
prices are right on amazon i'm just
saying check it out what else anything
else
that's all i got off the top of my head
dr mike anything i got nothing
all right folks thanks again sorry we
were on a slight delay we had the vegas
stuff going on so i think we got pushed
back a little
bit but no worries we're still here
answering your questions and we'll do
the same
next time thanks again for tuning in
we'll talk to you soon
peace
