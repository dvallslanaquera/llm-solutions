hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i forgot my last name
video number two in our series last
video we
built a powerlifting program that
includes all the stuff we need
and the first week of training now we're
going to show you how to run that
program all the way from the first week
to the second third fourth et cetera
through the deload and how to start the
next type of archery program so
here we go we're talking about the
programming bit last time
then we're going to talk about how to
figure out the length of the
training program which is the same
message cycle because we probably have
to figure it out
how to progress on relative effort like
how hard to train every week and
how much harder the last time we got to
train oh greg the set
little iago parrot jab same person
volume progression how many sets to add
if any
usually we don't we'll get to that in a
bit and of course how to do deloading
how to start the next hypertrophy meso
and then lastly we'll talk about what
the next video
is going to preview so here we go sample
programming but last time
feel free to pause right now and take a
look at it if you really have no idea
what the fuck's going on because what
the hell is last time
check out the video in this series and
this playlist that one came right before
this
we'll teach you or there we taught
exactly how to construct this program
just a sample but we're going to work
off of this all right
so progress is a trippy thing
because it really does depend on metal
cycle length you have
kind of a minimum requirement for how
hard to train how much to train
and a maximum ability and depending on
how many weeks
are between these two sort of depends uh
it really chooses our rate of progress
for us
like if you're trying to train for six
or eight weeks straight like
your rate of progress is gonna be real
small each time if you're trying to
train for
three weeks straight i mean your rate of
progress could shoot right up to the
moon it's just not sustainable if it's
longer so
we definitely have to figure out how
long the meso is because that will
determine how fast we progress
the meso length can be determined by a
bunch of stuff first of all it's
how far are you from the next meet so
for example if you know you need about
six weeks of training to peak and you
know about at least eight weeks of
training
to train for basic strength now you're
at 14 weeks out and then you need at
least eight weeks let's say if
hypertrophy work
well then you have a choice between a
mesocycle that's like four weeks long or
eight weeks long
probably stupid to do a six and then a
two that doesn't make any sense
and anything in between is probably you
could do like a three and a five or
something
but now at least you know you have eight
weeks and the logical structure is
probably four weeks and then four weeks
or some for some folks just eight weeks
straight
so that's number one and hypertrophy
mesos the accumulation part
can be between four and seven weeks long
including deload seven weeks so
to be completely fair it can be longer
than this
in general especially for intermediates
for whom this video is really targeted
four and seven weeks total is probably
best which is to say
three weeks of accumulation or one of
deload all the way up to
six weeks of accumulation and one of
d-load
okay can you do seven weeks of
accumulation one d-load so one stretch
of eight you can
but you may not be able to survive that
with the realistic improvements the
fatigue chronically would just be way
too high
but you might be able to try that so
give it a shot especially if you know
your recovery abilities are really
really good
so within that range you choose via meat
scheduling training age and recovery
ability if you're super fast super quick
to recover you can do longer mouth
cycles if you want
and if nothing else trial and error you
could say to yourself well
you know i've done five week med cycles
before there's no problem
i want to try a sixth week try it and if
that last week goes
total dog shit you're super fatigued
you're like all right five is the limit
if that six week go super great take a d
load on the seventh week and then maybe
next time try seven or eight weeks no
problem
trial and error is a big part of this
just start with something realistic to
be like i wonder if i could survive a
12-week accumulation like
was the best one you did you're like man
i was pretty fried seven weeks after the
last one like
12 sounds pretty dumb so keep it
realistic all right
relative effort progression things have
to get harder over time
in hypertrophy training we add either
reps
or load or both to make stuff harder and
harder and harder
in power lifting hypertrophy training
adding reps takes us out of a repetition
range and or
isn't really specific to the general
strength increases we want that
hypertrophy to power
remember most of the science so far on
what causes muscle growth says adding
reps and adding load
really is just an option adding either
one as long as you're in the target rep
range just totally cool
the beneficial effect of adding load
beneficial effect of adding reps is it
improves your work capacity more
same hypertrophy beneficial effect of
adding load is say hypertrophy but your
strength improves moral which one do you
guys think we're going to use for power
lifting hypertrophy
here's a pretty hard rule we add load to
the bar whenever possible
and not repetitions will that work with
dumbbell laterals no you'll have to add
reps
because you can't add your 20 25 30
that's insane it's way out of your rep
range
but if you're doing most of the power
lifting assistance movements
high bar squats differently left so on
and so forth you're almost always going
to want to add load to make the session
harder
not actually add repetitions because
that is not specific enough it's not
optimal now once you know your mesolink
you're gonna say okay week one we
already know we have to hit an rpe or
rir
of we'll just use rp it's convenient but
you can look on here the rr equivalents
are on here
an rp of seven in the first week and in
the last week before deload an rp of 10
because we want to fucking fry out the
last week struggle
really just push it to the limit
otherwise why are we stopping if we
could be pushing it further
we know it's 7 here we know it's 10 here
and then we interpolate all the rpes in
between
so if we have you know a few weeks it
could be week one seven
week two eight week three nine week four
ten
if it's more weeks than like four at a
time then you can stretch out and have
like
the same rpes or some people even do
fractional rp's i don't know what i
think about that i don't know how
accurate it is
like a seven slash 7.5 here you know 7.5
8 here what basically we want is on
average the rpes to go up over time
starting at around seven which is where
most programs should start
and ending at around 10 and all the
other rp's being somewhere in between
the two
you can use a stepwise function you can
use a linear function no big deal
just stuff has to get harder on average
over time once you interpolate these
you want every single week to add just
enough weight to last week
to hit roughly that target rp if you
make a mistake
and you way overdid it take the weight
down
or push the weight up to reflect and you
can even do that set to set a set for
example
last week we squatted 300 pounds for you
know three sets of five or whatever we
had to do
sweet this week that was last week was
rp7 this week's rp8
what would our p8 really be and a lot of
this comes down you get really good at
it if you do it for a long time multiple
uh macro cycles of this kind of training
and you really get used to like what an
rp
jump is as far as weight and it's
different for every exercise but let's
say like okay
310 pounds for fives i think will be an
rpe
you do the first set and it's like an
rp6 or some shit like nervous system
really changed your technique really
changed your work capacity improved your
strength improved
from that last workout and all of a
sudden you're like dude that was not
eight that was bullshit
so you hit a set of five stop at
whatever you did last time same reps as
before
and it's 310 pounds you're like okay
that was not
an eight that was a six i'm gonna go to
3
30 because 3 30 is probably going to be
an 8. you go to 3 30
and that was like a nine and you have
another set let's say you go to 320 or
325.
oh maron fucking beautiful that is an
eight
you're golden but now you have better
information you're like all right so 3
25 was an eight from last time it was
310
what do i need to do to get to a nine
next week well you know last week 3 30
was a nine
maybe next week 3 35 is going to be 9 or
3 40. that's your guess
and you can always change it set to set
alter the load not the reps
so that you get as close to the rp that
you want for the average of all the sets
in the workout
it's okay if some is lower and higher
just as i'm going to try your best to
average it out
and look if you hit it on the dot the
first one don't fucking change anything
stay with the same load until and unless
that load is untenable to hit that rpe
no big deal so if some of the sets are
six and if some of the sets are nine
no big deal as long as you're making the
adjustments no point at all to get anal
about the shit right you do a set of
five and you fuck fuck fuck that was rp6
no like sjw chaos rage mode
and then there's no reason to do that
because you can just increase the weight
now on the next set look if it was your
last set and you fucked it up
no big deal you'll get it done next time
long term slow progress
is how people get brutally strong you
imagine an interview with like larry
wheels you're like hey larry you know
was the you know what do you regret
about your powerlifting career so far i
think man you know
this one workout in 2019 i went rp
6.5 and i fucking should have done seven
bro i should have fucking done seven
like what the fuck
that's not what makes a difference over
the long term just try your best
right that's it now
if you can't do the reps
if you fail to match the reps with a
slight load increase
or you get the same reps but you have to
auto regulate down to the same load as
last time
you have hit your maximum recoverable
volume you might better hope deload is
next week
if it's not next week you have to take
some recovery sessions light sessions or
something because your cumulative
fatigue is too high
because you're literally not getting
stronger anymore that's a problem we
want to get stronger in that rep range
that's the key to powerlifting
hypertrophy
that's also another good reason why you
don't want to blow your low too early
right so if you think oh i could go 335
or 330
just choose 330. worst case case
scenario it's a little too easy and you
can up
the ante on the next set and if there's
no next set because it's the last you
know session
or the last set of the session you can
up it next week and if it's not the last
the last week and there's an upping it
up at next message cycle up in next
macro cycle no big deal as long as you
leave yourself
potentially some breathing room better
than hitting the wall early
if it's the last week of training before
you deload
yeah you can fucking push it
realistically of course don't get
yourself killed
but if it's not the last week air on the
side of a little bit less because you
need that breathing room
for next week two factors in progressive
overload
can you get a great workout this week
middle finger
can you get the next or you can your
next week also be good because if you're
having such ball or workout this week
and you need another week that it fries
you fatigues your next week sucks you
fucked up
right it's like going to a restaurant
and their dessert is amazing but you eat
so much of the main course you can't
even eat the dessert
you fucked up you you know like good
luck you know you
won't be in that restaurant for another
six months and people are like oh man
those what the fuck is a dessert those
crepes were so good
you know like god damn it i shouldn't
have vomited all that pizza or i should
have vomited more of that pizza so i got
to put in the dessert
i don't know about you guys but after i
throw up i don't really want to eat
anything
the most baffling thing side note like
in college
the idea of puke and rally where you
like get really sick from drinking but
then you throw up
and then you like keep drinking bro she
was never me i've
thrown up my fair share at parties
officially for me when i throw up my
night is
over like maybe i can go and like try a
little diner food but to be honest like
fucking
done fuck that in the comments below let
me know if you've ever thrown up
and continue drinking and if you have
done that
you are a commendable wild animal
all right what's up next volume
progression
volume is important hypertrophy you
don't just be want to be doing one set
all the time because that could be
insufficient to cause gains
great for strength training but if
you're doing that you might as well be
in the three to six rep range kind of
pointless to do low volume
in the hypertrophy range of 5 to 12 reps
kind of dumb
now load progression is still king
you want enough volume to get you into
that growth range but volume progression
is great for causing hypertrophy but we
want to progress in load
because we want that hypertrophy to be
good maybe not the best we could have
good but also incredibly well
transferring to strength
has to be a thing all right so what you
want to do is start your volume
at something like your minimum effective
volume we already talked about how to do
that
and then you progress via load only
don't add sets until at some week you
have ri-r0 or rp-10
okay you can't go any further fine
and think to yourself could i have done
another week of rpe 10 and
hit another mini pr okay so if you did
like
300 pounds in the squat for sets of
eight and it was
like every set or like sets of you know
sets of eight of 300 290 280 or whatever
and every set was basically to failure
or one from failure
can you think to yourself like okay next
week i can fucking totally do that with
305 on average okay just a little bit
more i can hit all the same reps
um if the answer is yes you hit your
rpe 10 and you didn't hit enough volume
to hit your maximum recoverable because
hypothetically you could do more
now if you really don't know and you
have an open-ended plan where you're not
planning on
on um dealering at a certain time you
just go until you can't
you can try it try another week bump
your you know of course you have a plan
like okay i'm gonna do five weeks up and
one down
but at the end of your fifth week if
you're like dude i have fucking money i
can keep going
try it and if you succeed well then you
know whatever volume you had on average
was too low
so if you succeed then the next meso you
want to probably progress in sets a
little bit so for example let's just say
you did three sets of everything in one
mesocycle
and at the end in your last week you hit
rp10 and everything but you're like dude
i can do our p10 next week i'm not even
that fatigued i can fucking hit another
pr
you didn't hit maximum recovery volume
you're not milking the hypertrophy
program for everything it's worth
next mesocycle or next macrocycle
whenever you do that program again for
hypertrophy
maybe you start at three but halfway
through the program or
just generally as you feel you inject a
little bit more volume
and then you inject a little bit more
hopefully just volume your usapl
testing here so if you started a three
maybe go to four
right don't start a four start at three
but then slowly over time add a set
here and there to various exercises and
at four sets of everything
and then see in that last week okay am i
at
my mrv right because after a while you
get good at judging this
you can figure it out like you guys know
what i'm talking about too some of you
have been training longer
that last week of rp 10 someone's like
what do you think another week after
this you're like
what are you fucking nuts i'm gonna die
there's no way i'm like 20 pounds weaker
next week if we go and test me i need to
deload
and if you think like ah 5050 it's cool
just can't it was enough volume
if you think man i can totally do
another week i'm being a little bitch
next time add more volume over time
you're going to learn your body really
well
and it's not a big deal now as
you get more advanced you're
added fatigue from every load edition is
going to be way higher relatively
also more advanced people have higher
minimum effective volumes and lower
maximum recoverable volumes
that means going from one to the other
isn't as big of a step anymore
eventually advanced power lifters
whatever volume set number they start a
program with
is usually the one they end it with all
of that fatigue all of that bandwidth is
filled up just by load increases which
makes things simpler
but when you're a beginner when you're
advanced you'll need to add sets every
now and again to keep that process going
right the target the goal how you know
your volume is right
is if you hit rpe 10 or r0
and mrv in that last week you tried your
very hardest and you can't go any
further if you can go further
well shit you need more volume because
somebody could say well you just need to
put more weight on the bar well i put
the maximum amount of weight on the bar
because i hit rp 10. there's no
rp higher than that fuck that rp11 bra
people say that shit i guess it's just a
meme you know it's impossible
maybe superman could do it yeah
all right that's your whole accumulation
phase
what do you do for deloading here's a
good approach again
not a dogma not a religion it's just a
decent approach
that critical thing about de-learning is
to take
at least some weight off the bar and
contract the volume
a ton because the volume is what really
fatigues you
some people deload with really heavy
singles they just do very few of them
and they leave the gym and it fucking
works
not my preferred method here's my
preferred method but
fundamentally deloads any way you design
them
have to be much less much less
absolutely critical so first half of a
week you have a whole deal a week first
half of the week
you can reduce all loads to week one
loads okay so you
worked up from 300 to 330 in the squat
okay and you're last week 300 in your
first three third in your last in your
first week of de-liding or first half of
the week
300 pounds back to week one which like
yeah it's not going to feel super light
but it's not the end of the world also
and here's a kicker do the same number
of sets but cut all the repetitions in
half so let's say you're doing sets of
eight
with 330 like uh five sets of eight with
3 30
like in your last week fuck that's
brutal right
in your d load week you're going to do
five sets
you're going to do sets of four however
and it's gonna be with 300 pounds i mean
four reps with 300 pounds compared to
eight reps with 330 it's a
world of fucking difference here's the
thing when you try this for the first
time if you tried it before you'll know
that's still a pretty fucking hard
workout it's not a workout that adds a
ton of fatigue it's definitely reducing
fatigue but it's still kind of like uh
why is it so hard you used to 330 for
you know five by eight
why is you know five by four at 300 hard
cause you're so fucked up
because you're carrying so much fatigue
but it conserves your strength and
improves your technical abilities a
little bit more so it's really awesome
if that's too much for you you can
definitely lower it because you don't
want to feel like it's the end of the
world now
second half of the week here's the real
deload deload part of the deload
that's like four d loads or something
would reduce
all of your loads 50 of week one loads
week one for us in that example is 300
you put 150 on the bar
fuck that's easy as shit you should be
embarrassed to do your last part of the
week you should still do it
but you should be embarrassed you know
it's like you borrow the minivan from
mom to go hang out with your friends i
sure hope nobody sees me driving this
thing
right same idea like load 150 pounds and
people like oh yeah i thought you were
powerless you're like
yeah no i am bro just you know deal week
and they're like i don't know what that
is are you just this week and you're
like god damn it
why didn't you see me last week i had a
situation where i was at gym once and i
was doing the first half of my d-load
the week before also visiting the same
gym i was there for like two weeks
i did a high bar squat it was 4 40 for
10
okay my top set and i was like yes it
was like an all-time pr for me super big
deal
and then i had a guy catch me on my
d-load
and i was doing i did 425 for like
a double or something in the d-load and
this guy watched me do it he was like
damn dude that's really impressive
and this is those three with super mixed
feelings because i was like thank you it
wasn't very nice
thank you so much thank you and then i
was made of joker he should have been
here last week it was really impressive
because it's kind of fucked up people
compliment you about shit
you're like right so this is really kind
of embarrassing 50
and all the sets are half the reps and
what you can do is that workout right
there is gonna take you like
fuck it could take you like 20 or 30
minutes so instead of coming to the gym
four times a week on your g-load week
you can do this come in twice for the
first two workouts that are harder and
heavier in the first half of the week
just like normal
they'll be 45 minutes instead of like
the usual hour and a half and then for
that
last two workouts combine them so
instead of coming in friday saturday
just come in friday instead of training
20 minutes and 20 minutes which is
fucking driving more than training at
that point
just come in and do friday for 40
minutes and you'll have the whole
weekend off and it'll be super awesome
super easy give that some thought
but again whatever you do make sure
you're still practicing the lifts
because you have to practice the lifts
you're using to be very good at them a
huge part of power lifting
and it's easy and it makes you feel more
recovered not less
especially towards the latter half of
the d-load week
every single day you have to feel better
and better and better if you do a deload
workout
and after it you feel way more fatigued
than you did before
especially a couple hours after if
you're like oh
that's not good you're not really
deluding because you're not bringing
down fatigue
now what about the next hypertrophy meso
if you have another hypertrophy cycle
planned you can begin it right after the
deload
same as this one in these past two
videos you can keep the same exercises
if they're going super well that's
probably a good idea if they're having
great
great stimulus to fatigue ratios for you
awesome keep them or you can make the
exercises a little bit more powerlifting
specific so for example
if you're doing if you had two
mesocycles of hypertrophy
and in your first metal cycle of
strength after you're going to start
doing low bar squats
if you're in your first metal cycle you
were doing front squats for quads super
super choice
in your second maybe you can do front
squats totally fine or you could do high
bar squats
high bar squats are heavier and
biomechanically much more like low bar
squats than front squats
so if you're going to make a change
don't do this this is what i don't want
you guys to do
don't start with high bar squats then go
to front squats and then in the first
measure of strength
go to low bar that's fucking ass
backwards it's less load it's less
specific it's a poor transfer because if
the last thing you did was front squat
with a bunch of weight
and now you got to go low bar you're
like fuck i gotta put a bar in my back
what the fuck i'm not used to this shit
it's awkward it sucks if you're going to
change exercises take them from less
specific
to more specific force strength easy so
if you're doing like
a ton of close grip benches and jm
presses in the first meso
when you're doing uh your second meso
hypertrophy try just regular competition
width
but with a gentle pause or sorry gentle
touch instead of a pause
and and just some work that looks more
like your competition bench then in meso
3
when you do your first strength meso you
can do your competition bench with a
pause and the transfer is easy you don't
want the other way around you don't want
to do a bunch of
touch and go benching in your first
mezzo and then the second message will
do a bunch of close grip and jm and then
get to competition bench you know what
the fuck
i don't even know where my hands go fuck
all that stuff and of course when you
start that meso
volumes go back to minimum effective
volume reduce your loads to your best
guess of your new
rp7 or or sorry your rp7 or ir3 loads
new guess because it could be updated it
should be updated you'll probably be
stronger
and begin to move up and load again just
like you would for the other ones
that's all we have today now after doing
one or two or three of these mesocycles
in a row for hypertrophy
you're nice and jacked and we're gonna
take that new muscle and make it
stronger
in the next video we'll talk about
powerlifting program design
for basic strength see you there
