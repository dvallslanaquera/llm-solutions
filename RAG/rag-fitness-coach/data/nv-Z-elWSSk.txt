hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and today's quick tip is
to stop
randomly maxing out your lifts at the
gym
oh boy
jimmy's begin rustling sequence
you know a lot of times you say hey
don't max out randomly it's not a good
idea and people will say but i want to
see what i can do
and my retort for that is why
no seriously why
because of two things first
if being strong
and how strong you are
matters to you
then you're going to do the following
you're going to use modern periodization
to try to get as strong as you can which
means you're going to do
a few months of sets of five to ten reps
to build size of the muscle then you'll
do a few months of mostly sets of three
to six repetitions to make that muscle
generally stronger through those
movements that you're practicing and
then you're going to take oh a few weeks
of sets of mostly one to three
repetitions to peak for your biggest one
rep max strength ever at the end of that
process you will either do a meet or you
will test your maxes at the gym same
same either way you peak you have huge
improvements you know how strong you
really are
and that knowing how strong you are
didn't interfere with making you strong
because the entire time you were busy
making yourself stronger the difference
between
building a house and taking selfies in
front of your half constructed house but
in this case because the selfies are on
max attempts the flash of the camera
pulls a couple bricks off every single
time or puts the
wood frame into disarray
not wise
on the other hand you could say well it
doesn't really matter to me how strong i
am so why the fuck are you risking
injury finding out something you don't
even care about
two ways to go here care about strength
do the right things which does not
include regular maxing
don't care about strength don't max
either way don't max
it is actually pretty close to that
symbol
now you could say dr mike why being so
serious i just like to max out
on occasion
and uh it's fun and to you i say hey
honestly like that's no big deal you can
max away all you like knows what that's
cool however just understand that what
you're doing while fun is probably not
potentiating any sort of beneficial
effects for you and it risks a little
bit of injury now you could say nah dr
mike i don't do a max max i do like a
daily max or like a 6 rpe single or
something well first of all 6rp single
is not maxing out and second of all if
you do like a daily max like how you
feel that daymax not an all-day grinder
max
then
you're
probably not maxing out to begin with
and also then it doesn't
really risk as much injury but also
doesn't really do anything
because if you take a daily max
it just maybe tells you how you're
feeling that day which also your regular
work sets would tell you that's what rpe
is for
so while that is a totally fine option
it is also usually superfluous and
just
by no means clear a good idea in any
case
again if you want to max out for fun
that's totally cool but understand it's
coming at a slight expense with almost
or possibly no upside at all
folks i look forward to the following
as always your comments but specifically
the ones about how your favorite lifter
who is so much stronger than me and also
a cool guy
always works up or often works up to a
max and am i really going to tell you
that lifter is wrong yes
see you guys next time
you
