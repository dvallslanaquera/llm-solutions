I think that's the biggest thing that
people miss out of is that pushing the
elow in cute I mean just it's like
shating hard at the top of the dumbbell
it's the same exact concept that's why
I'm telling you that push those
in together cuz most people they get
into the set and like oh this looks
really good 30 looks really great your
elbows out in front of you great stret
the biceps but the second you do this
yeah there is way more tension okay on
the me let the bicep right as we're
going for I push those out sque as if
you're super in top okay do I keep my
elbows l in front and then exactly if
you're trying to touch some together in
front of you're not going to be a to
because in the way yeah but that's the
concept
