hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization nutrition
myths video number three gaintaining
for best results in long-term
muscle growth let's get into
the claims reasons it's wrong
grains of truth to why it's not entirely
wrong and where people are coming from
on it
and then to best practices of how to
actually run your nutrition long term
to get the most muscle gain that you can
so the claim of gaintaining is this
you just eat in a healthy muscle
building way clean so to speak
and you don't actively try to gain
weight okay not all the gain
there's multiple gaintaining
philosophies not all of them
say that you're just supposed to try to
hit maintenance most of them
at least on average say that don't try
to force feed yourself
just eat well eat plenty of protein eat
enough
and just eat well and train hard and
then tons of muscle growth will result
over the long term now
reasons why it's wrong when you're
much over 10 fat or 18 or so as a female
a lot of times you can gain muscle and
lose fat at the same time
very very productively once you are
quite lean
hormonally nutrient partitioning wise
your body just
no longer trades off muscle for fat like
that
if you're really lean your fat doesn't
want to get burned off
for lack of a better anthropomorphizing
term and
it's really tough to grow muscle in a
very lean environment
unless you're providing extra calories
from somewhere so
it's a really tough thing that just
doesn't really happen anymore and think
about this way
if someone can be 15 body fat and gain
muscle and lose fat until they're 10
okay i can buy that
how many people start at eight percent
body fat
and gain muscle to get to five percent
there's a
they have to trade off of one or another
you have to as you gain muscle you have
to lose fat
because you literally just have to weigh
the same if you're truly maintaining
right now sometimes
your internal hunger cues and activity
levels will
let the gaintaning actually occur so
some people when they train really hard
they get hungry and their activity
levels are
not excessive they think they're
maintaining
but they're actually at a slight surplus
much of the time so they're not trying
to force feed themselves which is a
positive thing that this approach brings
but they end up eating a little bit more
on average over time
and then they do get bigger so they're
150 pounds when they started they never
focused on trying to get big
but they're lifting weights that boost
their hunger they eat a little bit more
and over time they're 155 160 165 170
and the entire time people ask them like
hey so you've been trying to muscle gain
phases you're trying to stuff yourself
like nope never stop myself just ate
normally right they'll say well that's
maintaining right
sort of actually there is a caloric
surplus there
some people just naturally get it when
they lift weights and develop the hunger
for food that for many people comes from
lifting weights and doing it hard
that does happen sometimes but sometimes
it doesn't happen and especially as you
get more advanced
and as you get bigger and bigger
physically and put on more muscle
your hunger doesn't just boost up to
where it's supposed to be
if you want to get 160 pounds jacked
and you weigh 130 uh five pounds right
now you ate 135
um it's likely that at some point you'll
have to purposefully
gain weight the slow and steady but at
times uncomfortable way
because your body will no longer want to
get much past 145 or
55 especially if you're not a big eater
or that you don't get that
crazy appetite boost from hard training
so at the end of the day a lot of us who
want to get much bigger than we are
gaintany will get us some of the way
there but not all the way
the end of the day getting much bigger
is throwing off your body's normal
balance of homeostasis to throw off
homeostasis a lot of times takes
willpower your body doesn't want to get
that big anymore it's going to have to
take
a plan it's not just going to happen
automatically
now there are grains of truth to
gaintaining what are they
you can in many cases get good gains
this way
in especially a number of conditions if
you're a beginner
awesome intermediate sometimes if you're
not super lean
this is definitely a really good way to
go if you train
very hard that's a good requisite
ingredient the harder you train the more
likely you are to make gains even if
you're not trying to eat on purpose a
psychotic amount
if your diet is very good very locked in
incredibly nutritious you
give yourself a better chance to gain
when not purposefully trying to exceed
calories
and the really big one is that your
hunger is such that you actually
do gain slowly without trying like some
people are just kind of meant to be big
and when they lift weights and it's
super hungry i had a friend
uh half a friend he's still my friend
when he was going through his muscle
gain phases
after workout like in the middle of a
weight training workout he would become
violently hungry
and for hours after a workout he'd be
super hungry
and in days he didn't train he would be
way less hungry so for him just training
five days a week
he ate so much food he barely had to
stuff himself and he gained pounds and
pounds and pounds
the thing is we'll save this for a
little bit later but that does not
happen to everyone so it's not a
guarantee but if that happens to you
yeah gaintaining is absolutely a really
good way to go
and here's the thing these gains come
with very low psychological stress
you just have a ton of enjoyment in
eating training having fun and growing
you don't have to count stuff you just
eat well and train hard
and the happens automatically
that's really really good and if it's
happening
that's awesome now if you want optimum
nothing beats intentional forays into
even higher body weights
that are gonna have to come with some
force feeding not force feeding but
eating a little bit outside of your
comfort zone
to willfully put weights on the scale
food scale that reflect themselves in
the bathroom scale to actually go up in
weight to gain as much muscle as
possible
so best practices what is the way
forward if maintaining is working for
you
if you're actually gaining muscle over
time clearly rep strength is going up
your physique is changing visually like
you like and especially if you're
gaining some weight over time
keep doing it there's no reason to
complicate things and stress out when
you actually have a thing that works
but if you're pretty lean especially and
if you haven't gained weight in a long
time your rep strength is sort of going
up a little bit but not a ton
and it seems that you don't just
automatically float up to a higher body
weight like
if you're one of these people that
weighs 175 pounds
and like for a week you eat a bit more
just because like friends are around you
eat some more junk food or you've just
been hungry that week
training a lot and then at the end of
that week you weigh like
177 and you're like all right and then
the weekend comes
normally still very healthy you're not
under eating and then the next week
comes and you eat 174
you're just your body's just not inching
up like that and those of you have had
to try
to gain weight on purpose i know you've
been there where you're like
hey ate a lot of food for a week and
next week i'm a lighter look what the
hell is going on
sometimes this just doesn't happen
anymore your body becomes a little bit
resistant wanted to gain weight and has
to be
coaxed a little bit on an actual
purposeful path
outside of where you might want to right
so if that's the case
it's probably time to consider setting a
moderate weight
gain goal external weight weighing
yourself on the scale
and eating to get there and you eat
whatever it takes bro like you eat at a
surplus which you may not find
comfortable from time to time
that occurs whether or not you are
hungry like last week you didn't gain
weight
this week you have to eat more calories
by thursday you're like i don't want to
eat this food well
if you go back to eating the normal
amount of food logic would say that
you'd probably just repeat last week
you don't gain but you're trying again
you have to gain because you have to
gain this muscle
you set out to do it you don't have to
it's your choice but once you've made
that choice you have to do a really good
job
something like five percent of body
weight gain over three or six months is
a really good conservative goal
hold that for a few months after you get
to eat a little less food take a break
then maybe diet off the fat over the
course of four to eight weeks that
you've gained
you're back to the same leanness up
maybe five maybe more pounds in muscle
and then you repeat that process if you
so choose to continue to get more
muscular
that phasic approach is what works the
best and almost
every single super jacked person you'll
ever see
got there by leaving their comfort zone
almost no elite bodybuilders power
lifters
strong men got to their level of
muscularity
by just being like i just ate well and
ate protein and
it just happened no way almost everyone
who's the most jacked they could be
had times not all the time but times
were for weeks on end
months on end sometimes they had to eat
a bit more food than they were
comfortable with it doesn't mean you're
shoving cookies and whole milk down your
throat the go mad rev
that is a way to get fat and muscular
you can do better you can eat mostly
healthy foods you can have a bit of junk
but just raise your calories a little
bit so that you're for sure gaining on
the scale
that's the best way to progress and
probably the only way
to unlock your full hugeness potential
go unlock that potential folks see you
