hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
we're going to talk about getting
motivated to train
in the last video on the subject we talk
about getting motivated for dieting
it's going to be a lot of the same for
training so it's going to be a shorter
video
if you want to see the super in-depth
version of all this stuff
take a look at the dieting video we did
before this we're definitely going to
have all the stuff outlined
but really the diet stuff is where we go
super super deep now let's take those
concepts and apply them to training
here's the thing we say getting
motivated to train and sort of staying
motivated to train
but we don't actually need motivation we
mean adherence adherence
is the idea that you come in over and
over and over again and stick to an
actual plan
which gives you all the results now
whether it comes to motivation or
various other
mechanisms or concepts we'll talk about
that in a bit
motivation actually means something more
specific
so when most people say motivation they
really just need adherence
right and adherence is your success to
sticking to a plan
and we say okay well what kind of plan
well it doesn't much matter it turns out
any plan of training that
gets you going hard and heavy
consistently will produce results
and any plan that goes a little bit
better than that nails overload
nail specificity nail fatigue management
work
really really well so if you train hard
specifically to what you need
and every now and again you take breaks
let the fatigue come down you're well on
your way to excellent excellent results
and adherence is to that basic plan is
by far the most important thing and the
details of the plan are not nearly as
important
so because most training success doesn't
come down to the details
and because it comes down to adherence
a lot of people get into the weeds damn
near this whole channel is getting into
the weeds of what
really makes training optimal and that's
so totally super cool
if you have the adherence locked down
but maybe you
and maybe some of your friends that
you're helping and maybe a lot of your
clients
the adherence is the trouble
you have all the knowledge in the world
you've watched a bunch of rp videos
you've read a bunch of books you've
trained yourself for a while you really
really know how to train people well
really well but sometimes we feel like
all of your knowledge and a lot of it is
just lost on people
because they can't even show up three
days a week in a row to train
and what kind of periodization are you
going to do for that i can people miss
half of their training days gee you know
you're really just hobbling along at
that point
however the science of psychology
sports psychology specifically sport and
exercise psychology has some really good
tidbits for us
as to how to increase adherence and we
do that
by understanding the six constructs of
adherence
and these constructs occur in phases
some of them occur earlier in the
process of beginning training
some of them occur later some of them
sort of run throughout the process
and if we understand these constructs we
can really really greatly benefit
because we can do the right stuff for
ourselves and really for our clients
at every single step of the way to make
sure
they milk every construct for what it is
and maximize their chances at high
adherence
and here are the constructs inspiration
motivation and tension discipline
habit and passion let's take a look at
each one let's define them and let's
talk about how to increase them as much
as possible
so that our clients are friends or even
enemies that were helping get more
jacked
get more jagged get in better shape
sticks to their training
which is number one for results first
construct
inspiration inspiration is the spark
that gets you
or your client to want to start training
right
it's good for getting you to start
because like all the stuff people talk
about it's all about building habits
like if you haven't started something
habit is irrelevant you can't build a
habit of something you haven't ever
started
so the inspiration is in some sense
maybe the most important of these
it's really not on the grand scheme but
it's uh critical
it's essential right um
the most essential thing about a
hospital is that it's a building
and there's rooms does that mean the
kind of building really matters no does
it mean the size of a resume matters no
how good your hospital is depends way
more on the kind of doctors and
technology you have
than the fact that you have a building
but a building without it is a
non-starter you can't have a hospital in
an open field
okay you need at least some tents or
something you have no enclosures there's
no hospital
just the same way inspiration you have
to have
at least to some extent to get people to
start once inspiration hits
it's not good for much of anything
because it just doesn't last very long
inspiration might be with you for
minutes it could be with you for hours
at the most it can be with you for a day
or two after that
it sags away and then you're left to
your own devices
in other words you have to other
constructs to use to keep you adherent
so inspiration boosts your adherence to
that minimum level to where you actually
start doing things
so it's critical it's essential but it
doesn't last very long
so it's upside is that it's required its
downside is that as soon as you're
inspired
and you get into a training plan you get
into training
you're going to have to do something
more than just be inspired
to keep yourself going now because
inspiration is important we got to
figure out how we can boost it
and really it's really important to
figure out how to boost it because if
you can't boost someone's inspiration
their level of inspiration might be just
under the threshold of where they need
to actually show up to the gym
so we need all of our tricks to boost
inspiration to get people to go to the
gym because that's
a lot of times a huge battle because
people won't even enter the gym
they won't even decide okay i'm gonna
start training how do we boost this well
one good way is being around
inspirational people like if you're
around people that train
and you're around people that are super
positive and upbeat you're like man your
training seems like a great thing it
seems like something i can do
and as a personal trainer if you're
recruiting clients or something you
being inspirational yourself being
someone that's a good person
that's in great shape and that trains is
a really good start people are like man
this training thing it seems like a
really good thing
but if you're not inspirational if you
say you know man training is really hard
and you're gonna
you know bleed to death in the squat
rack then you know people get scared and
maybe the opposite of inspired
next and this is something for a person
to really experience personally but
other people can sort of help it along
is kind of a negative view but
nonetheless important of seeing what
kind of not great shape you're really in
and some people decide to start training
similar to dieting
when the you know elevator at work
breaks and they have to go up five or
four or five flights of stairs to get to
the office
and you know like they've been taking
their fitness for granted look if your
fitness is never tested
if you wake up you watch your toaster
you walk to the shower
you walk another 50 feet to your car you
get in your car you sit in your car
you walk 50 feet in the parking lot you
get on an elevator you sit at your desk
you revert that process on the way back
you sit on the couch and watch tv you go
to sleep and repeat
you know you would have to be in
morbidly terrible shape for that to be
challenging so you could be in very very
bad shape not morbidly terrible
and feel 100 fine during that entire
time and then the elevator breaks
and you have to go up uh four flights of
stairs and at the end you have to take a
break your lower back starts to cramp
you're breathing super heavy you're
sweating through your suit and all of a
sudden you're like oh my god
i am unbelievably out of shape i don't
know where the time went like when i was
20 i was in shape i was on the rowing
team at university
and now i'm 35 and holy crap like
yeah i put on some pounds but oh my god
that might be an inspiring moment
in the negative way but nonetheless
pushes you to be like you know i need to
join a gym
i need to do something i got to start
training and maybe you also clean up
your diet but definitely training comes
up on the table
additionally lastly and there's many
many other examples these are just a few
is seeing success stories
you know a lot of folks you'll you'll
follow people on instagram you don't see
someone from your office or a friend
and they'll uh start training right and
then all of a sudden
three or four months later they're
posting pictures of themselves jacked
and lean and doing all this crazy stuff
jumping on boxes and doing
the muscle snatches and you're like what
this person was in terrible shape
and like they did it and like maybe i
can do it too so stuff like that
really really really good for
inspiration but remember inspiration
doesn't last
graphically if you take a look at the
screen there we've got
adherence on the y-axis and time on the
x-axis inspiration is that little bulge
there
that goes up for a real short time and
then comes back down we got to catch it
at the top
and use another construct of adherence
to make sure
our adherence sticks around the next
construct is
motivation motivation it's not just a
catch-all term for everything related to
adherence it's a specific thing
motivation in the context of training is
an inner desire
to train to want to train
when you say you're motivated to train
it means you desire training like i want
i i want to go to the gym
it's not like oh i have to it's not a
burden it's not even an inspiration of
like oh you know the gym would be
fun it's like a need it pulls you to the
gym
okay and it is good for fueling your
adherence day to day
after inspiration is waned inspirational
wayne after a few days
maybe probably after a day motivation
can kick in
to keep you going okay what it's just
not good for
is being reliable everyday support
system
because it waxes and wanes it goes up
and down sometimes it's really high and
you just can't wait you rip the doors
off the gym
and sometimes it's so low that you wake
up in the morning and you're supposed to
go train you're like
i'm not going anywhere i've had enough
of training this is stupid
so motivation sets up a pretty decent
baseline
but sometimes its waxes and wanes fall
below
what we actually need to show up to the
gym so it's critical to have
but we're going to need something more
to make sure we're not inconsistent
motivation is good enough to get you to
go regularly to the gym but you're going
to miss some sessions if you just rely
on motivation
however it's critical to have
so how can we boost motivation well
very very important is a clear set of
objective goals
with training what do you want out of
training if you're training for fat loss
i don't want to lose 15 pounds if you're
in the gym training to get stronger
you need objective rep strength goals
right
first couple of days you're in the gym
on inspiration alone you try some
weights
you figure stuff out you say okay i want
a realistic goal
i want to bench press 135 pounds five
times i'm
gonna give myself a few months to do it
okay
now that you have that written in every
time you come to the gym you do a 95 for
five and then you do one of five for
five and then a couple weeks later one
fifteen for five
you that motivation builds because
you're i'm getting closer to my goal i'm
succeeding
if you don't have a goal it's very hard
to figure out what it is that pulls you
into the gym there's nothing pulling you
in
because there's really no point for you
to be there it's like setting up
a journey you know uh columbus or
let's say your columbus sailed to the
americas he was motivated to get
somewhere if he just loaded up a ship
full of supplies and sailors it was like
let's just go
i can go out in the ocean and find some
shit you know it's very unclear
uh how they would have stayed motivated
that when you have a very clear
objective goal it's very very easy to
stay motivated
another tip is being around positive
people people that believe that you can
do things people that keep you grounded
are realistic
not people that are negative all the
time like if you're around negative
people in the gym especially
that's not really really good sometimes
you can be around negative people in
your life you know like you may be
living with your parents
and they might not like it that you lift
weights or maybe living with a boyfriend
or girlfriend and they might not like it
that you're lifting weights
oh you go to the gym again like why
don't you hang out with me like that's
not great
if you're around positive motivating
people they support you it's much easier
to stay motivated
another one related to the first point
hitting steady pr's
and letting them sink in so you hit a pr
you know 115 for five in the bench and
like it's a pr because you've never
lifted that much before
there's sort of two extremes of the
spectrum as far as a reaction from you
after you do that one extreme
which is a really bad idea is being like
yeah i ain't shit low like everyone's
strong i mean whatever
right like that's an unpleasant
experience if every week in the gym that
you show up
and you're not as strong as you want to
be and it's unpleasant when you look
back at three months of training
it's gonna be three months of not
pleasant how the hell are you supposed
to stay motivated someone's like hey do
you like training or no i hate it
because i'm not i'm a nobody okay you
could take second place at the mr
olympia eventually and still feel like a
nobody
then you've had 25 years of bodybuilding
where people literally look up to you
and millions of people
follow you on instagram but you were
only ever second place so you could be
like ah
shit but you'll never make it that far
don't worry because if you think so
poorly of yourself and never let
yourself
feel the prs and feel the pride
you won't last so on the other end of
the spectrum which is the much closer
end to be
is not quite like yeah the very talented
spectrum is like psychotic and being
proud for
hitting pr like oh my god i'm the
strongest man in the world you know
that's a little crazy but so we're in
the middle
towards that right hand side is probably
where you want to be of like
man like i did 115 for fiverr i'm
getting there man this is great like i'm
the strongest never been
feel it let it sink in and then when you
sort of hazily imagine the gym the next
day maybe you're tired
you're gonna subconsciously
be like man the gym it's a good place
that's a place where i've been getting
stronger
that's a place where i have fun that's a
place where i achieve things where i go
beyond
gee you know that's automatic motivation
so let yourself experience hit those
pr's try hard
and let them sink in be proud of them
not like crazy like you know
kid walking for the first time parents
kind of proud but like
feel it feel it and let it fuel you for
more a big
part of that process though doing it
right is making sure you're not
setting unrealistic goals failing
repeatedly and then blaming yourself
look it
does not matter how good your genetics
are it doesn't matter how strong you are
it doesn't matter what kind of potential
you have
you can always set goals that you can't
reach
right i'm sure superman there's some
weight superman can't lift and he'd be
like well i want to move
the you know the planet jupiter but he
can't he's like oh man i'm weak i suck i
quit being superman
that doesn't make any sense so you want
to set realistic goals
that are challenging so you can be proud
of them you're going to want to come
into the gym and bench the bar be like
easy baby pr
like you're not really going to feel
good about that you want to challenge
yourself
you want to make sure your goals you
know you don't want to be like okay i
benched 115 for 5 this last week
you want to be like all right 155 for 5
next week you try it you get it for a
double it falls on you like man i
suck oh my god you could have won why
not pick 185 at that point pick 315
just kill yourself with the bar because
you're you're nobody anyway right
that's nonsense pick realistic goals and
slow progressive goals you did 115 this
last week do you want 20 this next week
you get tired take a break then come
back and do 115 again and then do 120
and then 125
right slow and steady progression
realistic goals don't
choose goals that are crazy there's a
huge thing with goal setting
where people seem to think that they
need to set psychotic goals
in order to prove something to
themselves and they end up setting goals
that they can't achieve and they prove
that they suck
it's a nasty self-fulfilling prophecy
choose
moderate relatively easy but slightly
challenging goals first
you can always choose a little bit more
challenging goals but to be honest if
you choose the relatively easy goals
that are a little bit of a challenge
and you adhere to the plan you keep
doing that eventually you're going to
milk out all of your genetic potential
10 years later you'll be a fucking god
because you'll have hit these small
goals over and over and over and the
entire process
you'd be super proud of yourself and
super super super motivated because
you'll have been successful the entire
time you know or you can set crazy goals
you'll never achieve and be disappointed
every single rung of the ladder and then
never even get up the ladder because you
quit
because a lot of people they just have
disappointments and they quit and people
do the thing where they they take like
third place at a bodybuilding show but
they look the best they ever have
their next goal could be like all right
i want to look better maybe take maybe
take a second
but some people are like it's got to be
first place and i've got to put on 20
pounds of muscle
they put on 15 pounds of muscle they
take second place to some kind of total
stub that comes out of nowhere it's on
his way to mr olympia
and they're like oh my god i suck like
no you're the best you've ever been
and you moved up one placing and then if
they just stuck with it maybe the next
show they could have won first place and
all the
roses and awards and everything's great
but they quit because they were like nah
this is like
i didn't do what i wanted to do make
sure your goals are realistic
and if you don't hit your goals bounce
back but you should be hitting most of
them especially early when this process
starts
just by sending them realistically and
not super crazy
lastly a good thing for motivation is
overcoming temptations to slack off and
then really being proud of that
like you didn't want to go to the gym
friday everyone's like hey let's go out
to the club and you're like look
i gotta go get my workout and then i'll
meet you guys there later of course you
want to go home and just veg out and
then
take like a one-hour post-work shower
and then go to the club with your
friends
for sure but instead you go to the gym
you grind it a little bit
after the gym you have a choice of how
to feel
you can be like i do what it takes i'm
just a regular human like commitment
cool
or you could be taking your your shower
after the gym before you go clubbing
with your friends and feel like man i'm
a fucking baller
i was tempted to not go to the gym i
fucking did it anyway
and i'm fucking proud of myself and you
let yourself feel that pride
that fuels later motivation it makes you
believe that you can do things
really really important so if we look at
the graphical representation and
motivation here it keeps you up at that
about that level of adherence that you
need
but notice that waxes and wanes it goes
up and down up and down
so we're gonna need to establish a base
level
of how much work we're putting in to
consider ourselves inherent because
motivation goes up and down too much
we need to sort of plug something in
right about the middle of our motivation
say this is our watermark for doing a
good job because that's really
making sure essentially that your line
of adherence is at a certain point
we have to define what adherence means
for that we need to have more than
motivation
we need to have intention intention is
the next construct number three
intention is a commitment to execute a
plan
okay it's not just a goal but a road map
it's not like columbus saying okay the
americas are that way let's go that way
it's knowing the tides knowing the trade
winds
knowing how you're going to snake
through so that every point of the
journey you'll get navigate with the
stars
like they did back then and you're like
like we're making we you know we made
great headway we
sailed 150 knots yesterday like great
we're on our way we know where we're
going this is really good stuff
intention so for example
if your motivation your goal is to put
50 pounds on your panoram squat
in you know the next year that's nice
but you can sit at home and be like 50
pounds turn around
my legs don't feel any bigger the goal
and having the goal doesn't do actually
anything for you
what are you going to do about it that's
intention so you could say i'm motivated
and my goal is to put 50 pounds of my 10
arm squat
my intention is to train hard four times
a week to get there
now once you have that literally that is
an explanation of exactly adherence
right the training four times a week is
the adherence
the motivation gets you pumped to go do
it but the intention makes sure that if
you're not so pumped
you still go do it because you have a
plan
right what is intention good for
it is great for setting a clear what to
do
and what not to do instructions
especially the what to do
you're motivated for a goal but
intention is literally how you get there
it's the roadmap
it's the plan it's the if you stick to
this then you are being adherent
and really at the end of the day without
intentions
goals are just wishes i have a personal
pet peeve
it's fucking minor it doesn't bother me
a lot it's mostly for comedy
i have a pet peeve of people telling me
their goals
why i'll explain because goals
are cheap as fuck and they're fucking
meaningless sorry for swearing so much
not really you could say i want him in
the mr olympia
bravo when do we get the red carpet how
many people we can
come up to a kid in kenya randomly and
be like sir do you speak english you'd
be like yes they're great
say i want to be mr olympia he's like i
want to be mr olympia like oh my god
oh my god congratulations here's your
standout trophy he's like but i don't
i'm not going to do what it takes to be
mr olympia because i actually don't care
oh
shit talk is cheap so it turns out
motivation is cool and saying you have a
goal is cool
and even actually being motivated is
cool but without intentions
without saying i want to be mr olympia
i'm going to train this many times per
week i'm going to eat this many meals
without that stuff that's the stuff that
actually builds the shit
like imagine you're designing a
skyscraper you're like oh i can just see
it now it's going to be a thousand feet
tall
and someone's like hey where do you want
the bricks and you're like oh yeah
fucking prayer oh you have to fucking
build this thing
right so goals are cool but my pet peeve
is don't vary good goals are nice it's
good to have them
intentions i want to see intentions i
want to see a fucking plan
and i want to see you do that plan
that's what really gets you the result
now intention is great the plan is great
but it's not good
for enforcing itself you
still have to do the work to meet your
intentions and when you're motivated
it's easy when you're not so motivated
when motivation dips on you it
predictably it will
every few days for sure then you have
this intention like i have to go to the
gym today i intend to do that
but i'm just not motivated to go do it
don't worry the next construct will fill
in that blank for us
but intention's not good enough to get
you on your really really hard time
now we need intention how can we boost
it the
absolutely number one biggest thing is
and i would say this isn't even boosting
intention it is creating intention
literally
is having a clear training plan to
follow it really doesn't matter what it
is
people message me all the time and
message other folks at rp and say
you know should i do five through one
should i do starting strength should i
do juggernaut
look do something a lot of those plans
are really good yeah of course one of
those is better than the others i'd say
juggernaut's probably the better one of
all those three
but like look man just
have a plan and if you're worried about
the details of time fine
but make sure you have a plan any three
of those plans
is way better than just being like i'm
just gonna go to the gym and like lift
weights
okay so how do you know if you did a
good job what is your intention you
literally have no idea
like lifting lifting weights is the same
intention as like okay i need to go to
the grocery store like okay
i'm gonna go drive my car around okay
where's the chance you're gonna get to
the store like i don't know i was
probably a store on the way somewhere
that's ridiculous you want a map to take
you to go gps from here to the store the
same way as a program as a map to go
from here to there if you don't have a
map holy crap like hey you can still
train hard
but man it's tough to even really know
if you're doing a good job someone said
like hey
how have you been training like i think
i think pretty hard i think i've been
training hard you're like how do you
know how hard is hard enough you're like
i don't know like i see other people in
the gym
there for like an hour i'm sort of there
for an hour sort of do some sets
you never know and that can actually be
destructive to your motivation
because remember a big part of
motivation is doing executing your plan
and patting yourself on the back for how
the fuck you pat yourself in the back
for
you don't even know if you executed the
plan someone's like hey would you feel a
little lazy at the gym today you kind of
did a little less than you were supposed
to
folks if you don't know what you're
supposed to be doing how can you even
answer that question then you can get to
your demons and get the better of you
and you'll be like yeah i guess i was
lazy and then you have no idea what to
do but if you have a plan it's easy do
the plan and that's it
right huge plans be working out just
working out
buy a long shot right good plans have a
little bit of wiggle room but not too
much
right so auto regulation is fine but not
too much and
our regulation actually enhances your
intention abilities because it gives you
a lot of flexibility
but it doesn't give you so much that you
can just like not do a session at all
and be like oh i'm still doing it right
lastly having a coach or other person
who knows about your plan or knows your
plan hold you to it
is a really really big deal so if your
coach writes your plan you know exactly
what your tensions are
and you know that there's someone
waiting for you to be like hey how was
your tuesday
morning session you're like okay i
didn't do it right it's tough to tell a
coach that so coaching is really helpful
not required but at the very least a
coach can give you a plan
so with intention in this graphical
representation here it's this dotted uh
blue line
intention you set that blue line and
notice the blue line is set at a certain
adherence level that could be like four
times a week i train for an hour
with the following plan boom blue line
now notice
sometimes the yellow line of motivation
is over the blue line which means it's
more than enough to get you to adhere to
it like you have extra motivation those
are the days
when the yellow line is at its peak the
yellow curve
way over the minimum of attention those
are the days that you're like oh i want
to keep trading but i have to stop i hit
all my reps today coach is going to kill
me if i do more that's a great day
that's easy to do
then when the motivation curve crosses
the blue line that's like you're just
motivated enough to get all your stuff
done
that's when you do your last rap and
you're like that was great someone's
like more you're like
good god no like even if my plan called
for it i don't think i could do more
and then here's the real big problem
sometimes motivation
is way under the intention so you have
to do
whatever 20 sets today you're legit
motivated to do like maybe 10
maybe not at all maybe you're not even
interested in going to the gym what do
you do then
then we need our next construct of
discipline
what is discipline it is very simple to
define discipline is the use of
willpower
to get you to meet your intentions when
your motivation is not sufficiently high
to do it itself because people will say
like hey like
must take a lot of discipline to work
out hard and you're
passionate we'll get to that later
you're passionate so your motivation is
almost infinite
and you're like um i don't really feel
like i need to do discipline i actually
want to go to the gym you know
no one's like no one tells you like man
you must be really disciplined to watch
your favorite show
you're like well i i don't i want to do
that anyway like
i'm disciplined to eat tasty food under
discipline to like you know like
make out with my girlfriend or whatever
like i want to do that anyway and
someone's like man you're really
committed to making out with your
girlfriend like
what does it make any sense if you have
things that
your motivation is not always high
enough to do now that's when you need
discipline
you need to use willpower to fill in the
gaps between your intention
and that waning motivation really really
really important
willpower which is discipline is the
execution of willpower
to meet your intentions is really needed
on your low days or your low times
it's when you're finishing up your last
three sets and you look at the squat
rack and you're like
fuck i could just never come back here
again and it'll be totally fine
that's when discipline kicks in and you
use your willpower you grit your teeth
and you get those sets done
now the bad side the downside
what discipline is not good for is
sustainability
if your motivation is waxing and waning
here
and your intention is here you're
always going to have to use a crapload
of discipline
and in order to fill in the gaps because
the gaps are enormous
the thing is willpower runs out quick
and it needs to recharge regularly so if
you don't have remotely enough
motivation to meet your intentions
there's no amount of discipline in the
world that can catch up because you're
just going to run out of that willpower
that discipline uses
so motivation has to be close on average
right around your intentions
willpower through discipline is just
a tool to get you the rest of the way on
the bad days
and then your willpower recharges on the
good days when you're using motivation
and when you have a bad day again you
can grit your teeth a little bit
right so super super important i'll say
this
people talk about discipline a whole lot
they say it's the key the core
it's not like the key is actually
inspiration okay motivation is central
that's probably the most important part
which is probably why people talk about
it the most
is that average motivation is the most
important part
but discipline is incredibly important
because it fills in those gaps because
we're not always 100 motivated
on our low days we need this to have a
thing so it's very very important
how can we boost it the probably the
biggest advice i'll give you in
maybe this entire video is the best way
to boost discipline
is to know that you're going to have to
use it to know that there will be hard
times ahead and not being surprised
some people i've heard this from tons of
folks especially folks just beginning
first couple of weeks of training
they're like man like i'm really
struggling with motivation
i'm like what do you mean they're like i
don't always want to go to the gym
motherfucker are you serious that's the
nature of motivation
right you're not always motivated it
literally does this we know that
right so if you are shocked that you're
not always motivated
you're really a step behind when you're
not feeling motivated you shouldn't be
shocked
you should be like oh i'm not motivated
okay
motivation waxes and wanes this is
predictable and it will come back
i promise it'll come back up now that
you know
oh there's hard times aha i can use
discipline apply my willpower
and do what it takes coaches and friends
can be really really big for discipline
because a coach can be someone that
knows you have to have an intention to
execute
and you know you're going to have to
tell the coach whether you did it or
didn't do it
and at that point it's one of those
things where you're like i gotta apply
some discipline because otherwise my
coach is gonna be disappointed in me
like a plan is cool but knowing that
someone's there watching someone's there
expecting some things
can really help use your discipline and
a good coach can help coach you on how
to use your discipline can help
let you know when the troughs are low
for motivation let you know how to use
willpower
in the best possible way friends can
also help here's another one
music right music to pump you up
especially in days in which you're
dragging
can boost your willpower a ton like
you're like
someone's like okay let's do the set
you're like but then you get your beats
in your head and you're like ah
let's do it you grit your teeth extra
hard now again
this is why we include things like music
not in motivation but in discipline
because willpower
is what you're using it it contracts
it recedes it's like a battery that goes
low music can pump you up
but it pumps you up a ton the first time
you listen to it the next
favorite song you have doesn't pump you
up as much and if you're really behind
on motivation it only works for so long
right and you get used to your music and
all of a sudden your song that pumped
you up the most
just like noise and you're like good god
so it's not something you use all the
time now you can train your music all
the time but you want to save your best
most pumped up songs
for when you really really need to grind
and you're not feeling like you super
want to
here's a huge one deloading and proper
fatigue management
means that you're not always training so
hard that you're burning out
when you're trying to get super super
hard and unsustainable you take a
training break you take a deload an
easier week
and then all of a sudden your motivation
will skyrocket and you don't have to use
your abilities of discipline nearly as
much and
that recharges your willpower a ton so
it's incredibly like
there's no amount of discipline in the
world that can get you to come train
when you're fatigued out of your mind if
you never fatigue manage
so a big part of it is taking those
breaks like people say like oh man
jim's a really hard worker well that's
because jim takes his weekends and
really relaxes so he can work super hard
monday through friday that's an
essential thing
right so deloading really really big
deal here
and lastly practice right exerting
willpower is a learned skill
or we all know it but it's a modifiable
skill
and you exert a ton of willpower and
then you recharge
exert a ton of willpower and then you
recharge your ability to exert lots of
willpower goes up over that time
it's something you can train you don't
train it right by exerting it all the
time fatiguing overreaching and then
just burning out
but and you don't train it right by
never using it if you never use
willpower
miraculously somehow your motivation is
high enough then when you get into some
tough times you'll be like i'm not even
used to having a grind
so it's good to grind a little bit then
recharge grind recharge and it should
come naturally through the process of
training
the big takeaway with the practice is
you may have some had some hard times
like two or three days and last week
where you're like dude just going on
straight willpower like how to use your
discipline
you may think like oh my god that was so
hard because no way i can sustain that
well good news you're going to get
better at that and
because your motivation is going to come
up on average too it's all
sunny in the distant future so keep
going
here's a cool little graphical
representation of discipline we see
that the uh line of attention is you
know whatever it's at a certain level of
adherence
when motivation isn't high enough
discipline is those little blue
filler there discipline is using
willpower to fill in the gaps on your
low motivation days
to make sure that you meet intention
every time the result of this
is that even when you're not feeling
your best you still execute the plan
to put it technically your adherence is
still good
so your motivation waxes and wanes
you're using discipline by applying
willpower when it's too low
it's sustainable process the thing is
when your goals are worthy
you need to use quite a bit of
discipline and quite a bit of willpower
to keep your intentions uh sort of
filled in to keep them true
and at some point you can think like
holy crap like yeah when my motivation's
high it's easy but like
am i really gonna fight this battle
regularly and use
this much discipline and willpower yeah
it's sustainable
but gee it's not pleasant is it really
always gonna be
so hard the answer is no because of the
next construct for adherence
habit what is habit it's the automation
of
training in this case so that motivation
waxes and wanes
a lot less the longer you diet used to
be motivation would drop down a lot
but habits mean your motivation stays
relatively elevated
and the drops are really really small
and a good analogy here
is brushing your teeth once you
habituate something it takes
so little motivation to get done
your average ability to adhere to it is
super super hot
so what ends up happening is it's just
get much easier to do
do you have to use willpower to brush
your teeth
i mean a tiny bit someone could say like
man you brush your teeth every day and
you're like yeah
like oh god god are you motivated to
brush your teeth
look yeah sometimes you are like you
wake up in the morning you're
yeah that's always gone to like oh my
god i can't wait to brush my teeth and i
feel excellent
but you don't always feel like that
you're like i can totally go to work
without brushing my teeth fuck those
people at work i hate them anyway
i hope my breath is terrible but in
reality you still brush your teeth why
because it's habit and it's not like
this new experience your car
i've got to brush my teeth i use
willpower it's just every morning you
wake up and you're used to brushing your
teeth no big deal and someone's like man
does it take a lot of willpower to do it
you're like no
what like it takes a tiny little bit but
once i start habit takes over and i just
don't just do
what i usually do i've never brushed my
teeth before so i don't know i think
people do it like this
so the same thing happens when
you are doing a training program what is
habit good for
well it creates less of a demand for
discipline
and it raises adherence abilities which
is really really awesome
right once training is a habit
your success rates skyrocket and thus
getting to habit is super important and
habit predictably starts to
settle in after usually about four to
six weeks of training that's why a lot
of people will sort of catch the wind i
mean like
this is just something i do getting
people to not quit before
is a really really big deal right and
habit allows adherence
for the long term all of a sudden
training is not this battle of good and
evil
sometimes you're motivated and sometimes
you're not you're usually just like
totally fine to go train and just just
something you do
so on the other hand what is habit not
good for
and this is an interesting thing because
a lot of people that are um habitually
do something
they're actually not so good at being
coaches or motivators because
they just have no idea that the last
time they were inspired to go do what
they're doing
is like a really long time ago they've
just been doing it from habit so much
they can't even inspire all that well so
habit is no good for giving you that
initial
inspirational spark like you know let's
say you've been doing swimming training
you swim three times a week at the you
know community pool
every morning and someone's like man
like what what inspires you every
morning to go swim you're like inspired
but i wouldn't say i'm inspired and
they're like so how do you how do you
use the will power to get a diet like i
don't even use a lot of it's just uh
it's just something i do every morning
you know like it's just i put on my
clothes every day it doesn't take a
whole lot of inspiration to do that
i brush my teeth and i go swimming and
i've been doing it so long
that my motivation to do it is just on
average pretty high and it's not like
crazy psycho motivation it's just like
yeah like i'm just gonna get it done and
it's fun and it's good and i'm just so
used to it it comes
naturally right habit does not guarantee
that you're gonna fall in love with the
training process that's later that's
passion that's our last construct we're
gonna talk about but once you're
habituated to something it's habit that
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
be in love with it some people train for
years and years decades
they have a personal trainer they go to
the gym monday tuesday thursday friday
they're awesome at it they're super
healthy they're super fit and people are
like are you in love with training like
no not really like are you in love with
brushing your teeth
no probably not sometimes you really
want to train sometimes you really want
to brush your teeth but on average
you're like yeah it's cool right but you
get it done
and that's the most important part so
getting someone you know almost
always in order to get someone
passionate about something it has to be
habit first but habit is not a guarantee
of passion
all right nor does it give you an
initial spark however
habit is super super important because
it guarantees long-term success or
highly enhances
their chance so how can we boost it
first of all
having a plan with regular and
consistent training days per week
okay if your plan is super complicated
some weeks you do this some weeks you do
that
it gets really tough to build a habit
out of that so you want like you know
uh don't change your plan too much four
times a week these are the days
these are the times great uh having
similar times of training each day
really really important so if you have a
plan that's like okay today i have to
train
for an hour at the gym versus today at 5
p.m
i'm showing up that 5 p.m plan way
easier to get to have it
because you construct your entire day
around it as soon as you get out of work
like here's here's where people get
really really fucked over
they get out of work and they say to
them okay sometime tonight i have to go
train
uh okay you come home you have a meal
because you're hungry
you watch a few episodes on tv and all
of a sudden you're so tired
you just wanna hang out with your
friends and you're like man i'll train
tomorrow
nope but if you have 5 p.m after work
you just drive to the gym
it's habit for you to drive to the gym
or not yet have it
but it's look at you it's your plan 5 pm
your alarm goes off at work you're like
see a boss
go to gym at some point it becomes a
habit like every wednesday you leave and
you go to the gym
there's no way you're gonna miss a
session because in order to go home
instead you would have to deviate from
your habit like imagine
how do you miss a session of brushing
your teeth you have to wake up in the
morning
walk to the bathroom piss for like five
minutes look in the mirror
and go i'm not gonna brush my teeth
today that breaks your normal routine
but if you brush your teeth at like a
various time throughout the day it's
easy to just not get to it but if every
morning after you pee
you brush your teeth then like good god
it just it just happens
right it's just something you do so
having a regular training time
every day you know when you're gonna go
train that's great
huge one is getting together with a
training partner personal trainer or
coach
for most of you folks especially a
training partner that gets easy
just like wave off on your training and
not get into the rhythm of things if you
have a training partner
you guys are both committed to training
certain times a day that's some shit
that's happening and you're gonna show
up
because the training partner's there
she's already there she's already
warming up you better not let her down
because she's training with you you're
training with her that's how it works
so you want to make sure that if you
have a training partner you guys both
commit to certain times and days and the
best training partners i have ever had
are not the people that necessarily even
train the hardest although that's
awesome they're not the people that were
equivalent or close to my strength level
i've had much stronger i've had much
weaker
best training partners are people that
show up every single time
that is the best thing about a training
partner you hold each other accountable
you both get into the habit and then the
habits reinforce each other holy crap
you guys are going to do great things
not overdoing volume and frequency and
burning out is a really big deal habits
can only be habits
so that's another point if they're
sustainable okay if you have this
like your intentions your plan on your
plate is something you can't sustain
how the fuck are you gonna do it as a
habit you can't habitually train 20 sets
of quads three times a week
you can habitually train five sets of
quads three times a week
if you set something realistic that is
sustainable it's really easy for a
transition into habit if it cripples you
every time you're not going to literally
be able to do it
and the really big kicker and this is
something that if you're a personal
trainer or if you're a coach you really
got to communicate to your clients
habits take time you won't get to have
it in a week you won't get to have it in
two
and people sometimes can struggle be
like oh my god after all this willpower
this is crazy how's it gonna happen
be patient but roughly four to six weeks
in in my experience
people start to pick up steam and things
become habitual like you're getting
little kids to brush their teeth
the first couple of days probably sucks
they don't want to do it
the next couple of weeks probably sucks
because they know how to do it already
but they really don't want to
after that you get them into the habit
of it you check on them a little while
and all of a sudden they're just doing
it you don't have to tell them ever
again and they brush their teeth
hypothetically for the rest of their
lives same thing happens for training
it's a good thing is know
that habit is coming know that help is
on the way it's like that
the scene from lord of the rings where
they're like fighting fucking work army
and they're losing and they're like fuck
and they look over and gandalf's got
that white horse and all the fucking
warriors come to help him
that shit is coming that's habit it's
coming to help you so know that it's
gonna come
now obviously that still you still have
to fight all the orcs and shit like that
for the four to six weeks that habit's
not arrived but it will kick in i
promise especially if you check all
these boxes of making sure you got a
training partner making sure you're
regular and consistent in your timing
making sure you're not biting too
too much more than you can chew and of
course reinforcing that high motivation
letting yourself experience good results
being proud of yourself after a while
it's going to get the habit and oh my
god everything will get easier
right you'll get better at it right and
that's what they say
it's not that just that it gets easier
you get better right training doesn't
get easier you get better you get
stronger and you get more habituated and
then you unlock all your potential so
habit here's a little sort of graphical
representation your average motivation
just goes
up right and the amount of willpower you
have to use goes down to the point where
your average motivation level
is actually above your line of attention
so like someone's like are you motivated
enough to train
if you're not habituated you're like oh
today no but if someone's like are you
motivated enough to train and you are
habituated you're like yeah plenty
enough you know it doesn't even feel
like the level of motivation is that
high
it's just that motivation that you have
because it waxes and wayne's actually
less you don't even
feel as like oh i got the urge but the
adherence level
is as high or higher with just not
nearly as much effort not nearly as much
motivation just doesn't
take you much to kick over the box and
go and do what you have to do
lastly passion it's last because it's
actually the least important people say
passion is the most important
if you want to be an elite athlete sure
but not everyone wants to be that
passion is the love of the training
process like being in love with the
training process
and this video is being recorded shortly
after all the quarantine stuff has ended
with covet 19
how many of you guys feel that vibe you
know what i'm saying
you were in love with the gym you may
not even have known it but three weeks
after
you can't go to the gym you're like i
feel like i just broke up with my
greatest boyfriend ever like what the
hell is going on
like it's a tough it's a tough thing if
you're passionate now a lot of people
it's funny because those of us that are
passionate about the gym were like
when are gyms opening ah this is awful
um the people that weren't passionate
about the gym you could tell because
they're like oh i haven't
fucking trained in months and netflix is
cool though or like what you're not
suffering like
and then when the gyms reopen they're
like ah fuck i guess i gotta get in the
gym
and terrible part about the whole kofi
19 thing it kicked a ton of people out
of their habits too
so some of those people have to
re-inspire and go through this whole
process again
and of course getting back to habit is
easier if you've done it before but good
god but if you're passionate here's the
deal
you're gonna run headfirst into the gym
as soon as they open it
passion is good for fueling your
adherence to
insane levels and that either
leads to easy and super fun healthy
training for a long time
or unlocking your ability to train so
hard and be so consistent and so durable
that you unlock all of your genetic
potential
just habit alone won't get someone to
see the body of their dreams
as much as it could be but if you're
passionate about training
nothing's ever going to stop you how the
hell do you stop people that actively
go out of their way to train i've been
on road trips i go to foreign countries
as an invited speaker at seminars and
the first thing i do is find a fucking
gym somewhere
communicate sign language to people i
have no idea how to speak to them pay
money and get into the gym
how do you stop a motherfucker like that
right holy crap passion is a really
really big deal
the thing is it's not for everyone right
and here's some of the things it's not
good for so
it's not something you can get in just a
few weeks it takes months and it takes
years if ever you can inspire people in
minutes but you can't make them
passionate this is where a lot of
instagram influencers get their terms
wrong or even their process wrong
they say sometimes they say i want to
inspire people to become fit
that's actually possible if you're an
instagramer just your pictures alone can
inspire people
but some people say like my uh they say
my passion is getting people passionate
about fitness
holy fuck that is a hell of a journey
that takes weeks and months and even
longer of coaching and psychological
work and reinforcing and good
experiences
and maybe it doesn't catch on so passion
is not required
habit is required to do great things
passion is required to do incredible
things and look at your full potential
it's not for everyone a lot of people
can train the rest of their lives with
no passion at all just really good
habits
but passion is awesome to have and there
are ways to boost it and if you can get
someone to passion especially yourself
that makes a world of difference
especially for those elite outcomes
letting all of your potential flow
how can we boost it well you got to let
the success of training get to your head
okay you don't you hit a pr on your
deadlift and walk off and be like ah i
did it like but good i'm building good
habits
right now i enjoyed fine you walk off
and you just feel that flow
fucking fucking god i'm gonna be fucking
immortal i'm gonna keep getting stronger
forever
and you let it flow through you and you
just you drive home you guys ever hit a
big deal of cpr and you're driving home
you're just like
pull that steering wheel off break it
apart start to deatomize structures
fucking dragon ball z character type
shit that leads to passion right and if
you don't let yourself feel that kind of
pride and that kind of sense of
accomplishment
you know passion is probably not for you
sometimes you have a choice
of whether or not you want to feel your
swag feel it out turn up your tunes yell
a little bit that stuff gets good
if you're not faking it if you're really
letting it flow and you're really proud
of yourself
that helps build passion another one
train with friends and like-minded
people
like if you like let your flow go on the
deadlift you put the bar in after pr and
you're like ah
right if you have training partners or
friends that are like dude what are you
yelling for like man there's not even
that much any shit or they make fun of
you
like that's fucked up you want to have
training partners and friends with you
at the gym when you slam the deadlift
bar down they're like yes
yes and you're like you look at them and
they're like you're the shit that was
awesome
like man that just everything flows
there and it elevates elevates elevates
and then everyone's super passionate so
you want a really good crew
that really helps another one is take
training breaks when you need them
deloads active rest resensitization
phases
so training is never like a terrible
burden of suffering
like people will diet for shows and
train for shows or train for
powerlifting meets and you're like dude
how's your training like i fucking hate
it
this is a poorly managing fatigue of
course you're not going to be passionate
about it because it sucks
but if you push push push push things
get really rarified
back off push push push push push
rarified back off
that entire process is generally good
and you're getting better
really can lead to passion burning out
is the fucking opposite of passion you
don't want to set yourself up to do that
another one is having fun by doing some
different stuff
exploring different machines different
training splits different rep ranges
different modalities
sometimes when you're really involved in
some sport you could enhance your
passion by going into another sport like
you've been training with weights
generally
getting big and strong for a while maybe
do a power lifting you train more as a
power lifter you're
really like lights a fire under you then
maybe do a bodybuilding show training a
bodybuilder join across the gym do some
crossfit
all that kind of stuff is really great
sometimes to really keep things fresh
and enhance your passion for overall
heart training and overall fitness
really is a big deal now some people
like myself can key into one thing and
their passion just explodes
off of just doing that one thing more
and more and more and that's totally
cool you don't have to
liven it up but sometimes even within
that one thing like if bodybuilding to
me
was just doing barbell squats benches
and pulls i'd be like that fuck like
it would be a habit i don't know if it
would be a passion that the different
machines different dip setups different
pull downs different handles
changing things mesoderm that stuff can
really get you
uh in a place where training is more fun
all the time it's much
easier to be passionate another one
we're actually really huge
helping others with their training plans
when you start coaching other people i
don't know why
but it reinvigorates the fuck out of
your own training and seeing other
people succeed
bounces back to you so a lot of people
that are passionate they're not
personal trainers because they're
passionate they're passionate because
they're personal trainers like they just
started doing it because they were
habitually training in fitness
it was a good job they knew how to do it
and eventually they helped so many
people
they started become more and more
passionate about their own training and
about helping people it's like a really
positive feedback loop
so passion cool little graphical
representation here it's that dark green
squiggly line
it shows your waxes and wanes of
motivation because remember they're just
a critical feature of the whole process
but notice the waxes and wings of
motivation at the bottom parts of
motivation
at the right end of the graph you're at
a level of adherence that you were never
at the very top levels of motivation
before
that line of intention if you string it
out all the way
like there's no way you're not gonna
train someone's like are you
are you uh you know motivated enough to
hit your workout you're like well let's
see i'm passionate which means i could
do
double this workout and still be
motivated enough
that's a really really great thing to
have now
let's finish this out the long term
most people can train for a short time
okay people say new years
proof new year's resolutioners they're
great
they show up for one week two weeks
three weeks and then they're gone
you guys know what it's like in the gym
you know january 5th
you're like how is it possible that two
people can sit on a lap pull down
machine
at the same time what the hell is going
on right but
after a few weeks most of those people
are gone and it's like you like
come in and maybe you never talk to them
but there's like other jack guy or jack
girl in the gym that you haven't talked
to yet and like you come in the first
week of january you look at them and
they're like uh and you're like do that
thing where you're like good god what
are we doing here
and then three weeks later you look at
them again and they're like and you're
like yep
it's just us again because everyone's
gone everyone can train
more or less for a short time but making
it more than a few weeks is tough
by knowing the six constructs of
adherence you as a friend or as a coach
or as a mentor as a personal trainer
can boost them as much as possible to
get as many of those folks that come
into the gym
to last long enough to get to have it
when they get to habit way more of them
hang around not everyone will get to
passion but habit is good enough for
most
like your general population clients and
if you've got somebody to have it
be positive be involved and if it's
yourself that you're talking about do
all the right things all the
recommendations for passion and maybe
you'll get passionate too but if you
don't no big deal
at least getting the habit using all
these constructs of adherence
folks give this some thought if you have
any questions
shoot them into the comments below and
if you like a question
that someone else has asked upvoted so
we can see and maybe we'll respond to
some of the upvoted questions
in future videos folks during this video
hilariously
we had to take like 50 cuts because
there's a dog barking
two dogs two separate dogs barking like
crazy outside of our apartment
if you want a job being a dog hunter
in philadelphia give me a call 555-5555
folks thanks so much
see you later
