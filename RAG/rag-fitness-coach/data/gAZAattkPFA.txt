um i do think there is something uh
special for lack of a better word
in that zone where you're going
absolutely all out something that you
just
won't get from always leaving a rep or
two in reserve
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today we're talking
about the truth
when it comes to training to failure now
this is something that i would say the
vast majority of average lifters in the
gym
don't genuinely understand and it
definitely holds their gains back
as a result so keep on watching because
this is a key principle to understand
and i'll also show you some examples
throughout this video of what training
to failure
actually looks like from my own personal
workouts so let's jump into it what
is the truth about training to muscular
failure
the truth about muscular failure is that
a very high percentage of people out
there
have never actually trained to
legitimate muscular failure
even though they think that they have
and their idea of failure
is actually quite a bit short of what
true muscular failure really is
okay it's critical to understand that
muscular failure is not the point in the
set where
it starts to feel really uncomfortable
and your muscles are burning
your reps have slowed down and you're
pushing really hard but the discomfort
is just too much to tolerate and so you
put the weight down and end the set
that is not muscular failure muscular
failure means
that regardless of how physically and
how mentally difficult the set feels
no matter how badly you want to quit
okay as long as your form and your
technique is still
solid you continue to exert yourself and
not just exert yourself but exert
yourself with a hundred percent maximum
effort with every ounce of strength
that you can generate you don't pretend
to give a hundred percent okay you don't
give 90
and then mentally convince yourself into
thinking that it's 100
so that you can stop failure means that
the physical and mental discomfort is
completely irrelevant
and you continue to push forward with
full force and despite that
despite your absolute greatest efforts
even if there was a million dollars in
cash
right there in front of you and the deal
is that if you just perform one more rep
you get the money
you still would not be able to do that
extra rep in proper form
that is what muscular failure actually
means so for example this for me is what
a true
failure set looks like using a basic
curling exercise to demonstrate and this
is a set consisting of six total reps
so the first rep is easy this here is
four reps in reserve
this is three reps in reserve not sure
what that face was that i just made
there i think it's because the weight
felt heavier than i expected two reps in
reserve getting more difficult i was
actually aiming for seven reps on the
set but i ultimately fell
short this is one rir most people don't
go beyond this and they probably would
have stopped on the previous rep
and yes these really are the faces that
i make when i train all out and then
this here is the final zero rir grinder
rep unless i really started cheating and
using a bunch of momentum there is
zero chance i could get another rep
beyond this that's me curling as hard as
i possibly can with every fiber i can
muster now i could continue with
partials but
i prefer to do a really slow negative
instead and i'll talk more about that
and show another example here in a
minute
now to be totally clear i am not saying
that that's how you should train on
every single set
okay that's not the point here um those
all out to failure sets can be added in
here and there
especially if you're more advanced but
the reason why it's so important
to clearly understand what muscular
failure actually is
is because when we talk about the
question of how hard you should train to
build muscle
uh like we discussed a few weeks ago in
this video we usually talk in terms of
reps in reserve so how many reps before
that point of muscular failure
are you stopping your set for example if
you took your ten rep max and you did
nine reps
that would be one rep in reserve or one
rir
if you did eight reps then it would be
two rar and so on but
if you don't understand what true
muscular failure is or what it really
feels like if you've never actually
pushed yourself
to that limit and like a lot of lifters
out there your idea of
failure is actually two reps in reserve
so you think you went to failure but you
still actually had two more reps
left in the tank if you truly went all
out then in that case you are not going
to end up training hard enough
to stimulate maximum gains and this is a
very very common thing
and i've talked about it many times
which is that most lifters on average
don't train with enough overall effort
across their
entire training program as a whole in
order to get optimal results
and i really think that when it all
comes down to it effort is the primary
factor that separates those who get
decent gains from those who get
outstanding gains over
the long term it's found in that little
sort of make or break zone as you start
getting within a few reps of muscular
failure the people who
really get the higher level results are
the ones who consistently push that
envelope just a bit further
and really challenge themselves right up
near or all the way to their true
maximum capacity now regular subscribers
here have heard this recommendation many
times before
but i think as a general overarching
guideline the bulk of your sets should
probably land
somewhere around one to two reps in
reserve so
gun to your head you could only squeeze
out a maximum of one to two more reps in
proper form
that's probably where you should be
stopping uh the bulk of your sets
some sets might fall to three rar
especially
higher rep sets where it can be harder
to gauge exactly where you are
some will be all the way to zero rar
like i just described but about one to
two rir
is a good sweet spot to center your
training around and then as you become
more advanced
and as you gain more and more muscle
generally speaking i think your overall
effort level
is gonna need to steadily increase and
you're gonna need to spend more time
in that sort of one rir to zero rar zone
and even going beyond that sometimes
with certain advanced techniques here
and there
but in any case if your idea of failure
is
actually too rir then one to two rar for
you is more like three to four rar
which will stimulate some growth but
it's not going to be anywhere near ideal
if that's how most of your sets are
being done you know to be completely
honest i
barely even feel like i'm working out if
there's four reps in reserve
i feel like i might as well have just
stayed home on the couch and even if
there's
three reps in reserve on most exercises
maybe aside from let's say
a higher rep really big compound lifts
even three reps on reserve is a pretty
damn easy way to train
and i get that none of this is going to
be perfect you know you can't always
calculate
exactly how many reps short of failure
you are especially if you're a novice
um as you become more experienced it's
going to get easier and easier to do
that
but you get the general idea of what i'm
saying here okay this doesn't have to be
perfect it's just an
overall recommendation to help guide you
in the right direction but the bottom
line is that if you don't understand
what muscular failure truly is then you
also don't know
what one or two rar truly is either and
you're probably going to end up stopping
short
of what is actually optimal for building
muscle
or you might end up doing another very
common thing which is training
uh sufficiently hard on certain
exercises for certain muscle groups but
then not on others
so maybe your chest flies and your
tricep extensions and your lateral
raises
those are all being done with a high
enough level of effort since they're
easier movements but then your pull-ups
and your squats and your
overhead presses and your rows those are
not and so you're maximizing the gains
on those easier exercises but then
you're missing out on the more
challenging ones
that really train the biggest muscle
groups on your body and that are going
to have the largest overall impact
and by the way if you want to get a

um this is not just a fully structured

is up here
and down in the description box below
now a lot of people seem to kind of
demonize this idea of training to
failure nowadays like
it's this big scary boogeyman and if you
go to failure then your central nervous
system is going to completely shut down
your joints will break in half and your
nuts will spontaneously combust
but this is really just nonsense okay if
your training volume is properly
adjusted to compensate
then high intensity to failure programs
can still work really well
and i personally went that way training
for years on end and that style in my
younger lifting days and i made great
gains that way and i had no
issues with recovery um it's not what i
recommend to people now as a default
approach
but it is still a viable way of training
if done correctly
but at the end of the day okay
regardless of your stance on training to
failure
you're still gonna have to train to
failure sometimes otherwise you have no
way of knowing what failure
actually is and so you can't gauge reps
and reserve properly either
and this is also a reason why i don't
trust training to fail your studies
especially when it's done on novice
lifters you know i'd love to be in the
lab to see what they actually consider
as muscular failure
and if those sets and the studies are
actually going to true failure which i
would bet in a lot of cases they are not
you know i've seen some research where
it'll say subjects did nine sets of
squats
to failure three times per week like if
you're actually going
to true gun to your head failure on a
barbell squat
[Music]
then after one or two sets you should
basically feel trashed
maybe three if you have really high
tolerance but it's not going to be much
more than
a few sets before your performance
completely plummets and you're on the
verge of throwing up or where you
actually are on the ground throwing up
which happened to me quite a few times
when i used to do my leg workouts with
all of the sets to failure and you're
definitely going to need more than 24 to
48 hours
to recover from that you're not going to
be doing that three days per week
now if your goal is not necessarily to
gain as much muscle as possible and
you're just training for general fitness
and you want to gain some size but not
necessarily to a maximum level then
that's totally fine and this whole thing
becomes a lot less important
and as long as you're training decently
hard you know you're pushing yourself
and you're generally progressing over
time then that's probably going to be
okay
for your purposes you know you can still
definitely build a decent physique that
way
but if you are looking to achieve very
significant results okay if you're
trying to take your physique up to that
truly impressive level
then you need to gain a true
understanding of what muscular failure
actually is
you've got to spend some time truly
pushing yourself to the limit so that
you can then properly gauge
what one rep in reserve and two reps in
reserve and so on
actually means and for maximum growth
and i know this is debated but i would
say that you probably do want to be
training to failure on at least some
sets here and there
i do think there is something uh special
for lack of a better word
in that zone where you're going
absolutely all out something that you
just
won't get from always leaving a rep or
two in reserve
now it should go without saying that if
and when you are doing this
proper form and technique should always
be at the absolute forefront okay
muscular failure means that you can't
complete another repetition
in proper form you know a slight amount
of form lenience is probably fine on
most lists toward the very end of the
set you know like the last rep of a curl
if you have to lean back slightly that's
probably fine as long as it's done in a
controlled way
uh same thing on a lateral raise you
know on a row if you
just have to hitch slightly to get that
last rep or two that's not necessarily a
bad thing you don't need to move like a
perfect robot
and actually if you do try to move too
strictly it's probably going to limit
muscular overload overall
so some slight form deviation or a small
bit of momentum
is usually fine on those all-out sets
toward the very end
just be especially careful on the
biggest list like squats and deadlifts
you know for those i'd say once your
form noticeably slips then that's where
it's time to end the set
and then lastly is the question of where
exactly to stop the set
when you're training to failure so do
you perform that last all-out grinder
rep where you know with certainty that
you can't do another rep and you just
stop there
or do you perform that grinder rep and
then attempt another
half or quarter rep until the bar
literally won't move at all
and i would say that that depends on the
experience level of the lifter
as well as the exercise uh for those on
the more novice side if you are going to
go to failure then i think that just
performing
that last all-out grinder rep is going
to be good enough whereas for those who
are more on the intermediate to advanced
side
as long as your form is solid and you
know what you're doing then it's okay
to do that last all-out rep and then
attempt another rep even if you know
that it's not going to be a full rep
so maybe you do the all-out grinder rep
like you see here
then you squeeze out another half rep
then a quarter rep and then maybe you
stop there
or the other option the one that i
personally prefer is to do
the all out rep and then just perform a
really slow negative at the end of the
set and lower the weight down as slowly
as possible
under very strict control but whichever
method you use keep in mind that you
should only do this on exercises where
it's safe to do so you definitely
wouldn't want to do this on like a squat
or a deadlift
probably not even a leg press because
this would be more suited to
isolation lifts or to more stable
machinery cable exercises but if you
truly are advanced then you can go ahead
and make that judgment call for yourself
