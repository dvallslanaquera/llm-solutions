all right what's going on guys so in
this video i'm gonna be doing a q a it's
been a while since i've done one of
these so yesterday i went
on instagram and recruited you guys for
some questions and i got a bunch of them
so i'm gonna do my best to answer as
many as i can
in this video i've got some pre-workout
over here i'm gonna sip on this as i go
through the questions and then i'm going
to hit
an arm workout just after this so i'll
probably overlay some clips
from that workout up here oh and just a
quick recap so i'm actually still
running
a full body split every other week so
right now i alternate with
a full body week and an upper lower week
and then i've got one
roaming hypertrophy day where i'll go in
and hit any body parts that i feel like
didn't get quite enough volume
on either of those weeks so that's what
we're hitting today so anyway
let's get started with the first
question do you think wearing a mask has
impacted your performance at all so this
is a good question i get asked this
so much because i do wear a mask a nice
bit in the gym um so just for context
i'm in jacksonville florida right now
and cases here are pretty high
and the gym that i train at requires
that you'll wear a mask
when walking into the gym and when
walking around in the gym
but you don't have to wear a mask when
you're actually exercising
i often will still wear a mask when i'm
actually lifting just because
to answer the question no i don't really
find it impacts my performance much at
all
and i don't want to for one constantly
be fiddling with my mask because that
can
increase risk of transmission as well
also if there happens to be anyone else
around
i'd rather just kind of be safe than
sorry um but if there is
nobody else around like if the gym is
empty which it often is when i train
then i won't wear a mask in that
instance so
in some clips i might be wearing a mask
and some others i might not
um but in general no i don't find it to
be that big of a deal
the reason is probably because most of
my compound work
comes in a lower rep range so it's very
rare
that on the most fatiguing exercises so
like squats bench presses deadlifts etc
i'm usually not going over eight maybe
ten reps it's not that cardio intensive
to begin with so your breathing just
shouldn't really be a limiting factor
even if it's a bit inhibited and then if
i do any high rep isolation work
isolation work is not that hard anyway
one exception was when i had to do a set
of eight on squats
and for rep seven and eight trying to
get that big
breath of air in from my valsalva was
pretty brutal so
i could see the mass being an issue
obviously when potentially when doing
cardio
and if you do like crossfit style
training where you're doing
high reps and you know lots of compound
exercises
but for the way i train it hasn't really
been a big deal um if you guys are
interested in more on like the science
behind
masks and working out and all that i'll
link a really good article by
dr carl juneau down below which kind of
goes through
what the medical and scientific
consensus is right now on exercising
with masks
but for me i tend to take a better like
better safe than sorry approach
especially if it's not really impeding
my training to begin with okay
how do you cope with losing strength
when cutting i try focusing on
rpe and not the numbers so i think a lot
of people
just accept it as a conclusion that
you're gonna lose strength when you cut
i feel like that's already kind of the
wrong way to look at it i think that
most people by far shouldn't lose
strength
when they're cutting a possible
exception to that would be people who
are trying to get contest lean so like
below eight percent body fat
or people who are really overweight and
it just ends up changing their leverages
so much so if you were like
a really heavy power lifter and you
dropped a bunch of weight classes you'll
lose some strength
but for most people who are just trying
to get say beach lean
you really shouldn't lose strength
throughout that cut
and if you are losing strength it's an
indication that you're doing something
wrong
that could be something that you're
doing wrong with your diet or with your
training so with your diet
if you want to reduce strength loss as
much as possible
you want to diet more slowly so you
should only lose about one percent of
body weight
per week as a maximum so if you weigh
200 pounds
that would be about two maybe two and a
half pounds per week
to help maintain your strength also when
it comes to diet
don't cut carbs completely or do really
extreme stuff
with your diet that is when you start to
see strength loss and then
when strength loss comes muscle loss
tends to follow
when it comes to your training don't
change everything drastically a lot of
people will start just doing
machines and really high rep stuff and
forget about the basic strength
training that actually built their
muscle to begin with so i'm
really big on trying to maintain
strength for as long as possible
uh into your cut another potential thing
to keep in mind in your specific
instance
would be to consider reducing your
volume because at a certain point
as you get leaner you only have so much
ability to recover to go around
and i would much rather see you direct
that recovery capacity toward
keeping a tensile stimulus on the muscle
that means maintaining
whatever weight it was you were using on
those exercises
before you started cutting i would
rather see you direct recovery toward
that
than towards just doing a lot of volume
so a good strategy to help maintain
muscle would be to reduce your volume
even reduce your volume as much as a
half of what you were doing before
if it means it's going to allow you to
maintain your strength
and then the second part of your
question you said you focus mostly on
rpe and not the numbers i think it is
smart to focus on rpe
but rpe might start to change for you as
you cut
just because your workouts might start
to suck a bit more
so what used to feel like say an rpe of
8 or an rp of 9
when you were bulking that might feel a
lot worse
now that you're cutting and if you just
exclusively rely on rpe
you might start stopping at a true rpe
of 6
and just because you feel worse you
might say oh that was an 8 or a 9.
and then that can really accumulate to
lead to strength loss over time
so rpe is good but you just might need
to recalibrate it now that you're
cutting and figure out okay
this is what a true rpe 10 feels like or
this is what a true rpe 9 feels like
now that i'm cutting and then use that
as your gauge because i could see that
being a slippery slope and end up
leading to more strength loss than what
you should see
so i would say you need to focus on both
you do want to compare your numbers to
what you were doing before and try to
maintain those the best you can
but you also want to pay attention to
your rpe and that means
potentially updating your software in
your head
of what it is that each value means on
that rpe scale for you
now that you're cutting um so okay
that's my full answer for that okay
advice for someone who's starting to
lift for the first time
um so i really like this question i
think it's really important um
in my channel and i would say most
content creators out there tend to focus
more on
the intermediate to advanced stuff
because it's
just kind of more interesting what works
for beginners
is the basics and you can only cover the
basics so much until
it kind of starts to get boring for us
but that doesn't make it any less
important
so what i decided to do i actually
reached out to my friend
who runs the channel picturefit which i
would imagine many of you guys are
subscribed to if you're not you should
his
channel is fantastic and we're going to
collaborate on a video
covering everything you need to know as
a beginner very briefly like i said you
need to focus on the basics and you need
to focus
on balance so the basic basics all that
means
is you pick a handful of fundamental
movement patterns
master the technique on the exercises
that train those movement patterns
and just progressively get stronger with
them over time
you don't need to be constantly
switching it up and you probably
shouldn't follow or copy exercises that
you see
on instagram or even here on youtube
because a lot of the people
who run those accounts are more advanced
and so they tend to put out
more advanced content which might not be
appropriate for you
so as a beginner really quickly there
are six
main types of movements that you need to
include in your routine
i'll just put them here next to my head
and you can pause and read them
if you're interested as a beginner a
very good routine would be to just
pick one exercise for each of these six
key movement patterns
and that would be your full body workout
so do two to three sets
of each exercise and then repeat that
full body workout
two to three times a week and that's
really all that you need to do
if you want to sprinkle in a little bit
of extra calf work a little bit of extra
ab work
that's good but the key for you should
be
mastering the movement patterns learn
how to do a squat type movement
learn how to do a goblet squat if the
squat intimidates you
learn how to do a hip hinge type
movement so learn how to deadlift get
better at that over time
the deadlift is intimidating at first
you can do a romanian deadlift or you
can do a lower back extension
to begin with but you need to master
those basic techniques
on the basic movement patterns and stick
to that for a while
and then later on you can start doing
the more advanced stuff you can start
doing
fancy exercise variations and intensity
techniques and
increase your volume later a lot of
beginners want to
jump to the high volume stuff right away
because they want to get results as fast
as possible
but then what are you going to do a year
or two down the road when you plateau
if you start with high volume you've got
nowhere to increase once you actually
hit a wall
so that's what i mean by starting on the
basics the other thing is you need to
focus on balance
so a lot of guys tend to focus on arms
and pecs when they first start in the
gym and that can lead to a really
disproportionate unbalanced physique
later down the road you need to train
the whole body and the same thing goes
for women women tend to
only train their glutes and maybe their
abs you really need to focus on the full
body
and that's going to allow you to have
that base strength and size that you can
then specialize on
later so the specialization comes later
at the beginning just focus on the
basics and achieving balance with your
training
one other thing to keep in mind as a
beginner is sometimes it takes time
for muscle growth to occur so it's
really common for hypertrophy to be
delayed by a month or maybe two months
so you might start training and a month
can feel like a long time and you might
be like
okay i'm getting a bit stronger but i
don't see any new muscle tissue i don't
seem like i'm
growing at all but that's completely
normal neurological adaptation
usually precedes hypertrophic adaptation
so
there is usually this lag so you just
have to be patient continue to get
strong
that's a good sign that you're making
progress and then after a month or two
you'll start seeing the muscle come
on and you guys can stay tuned for that
video with picture fit it'll be really
good
okay i'm gonna do one more question then
i'm gonna hit my workout and we'll
continue after
so last question for now uh does muscle
fiber type so type 1 or type 2 muscle
fibers
affect how many reps per set are more
effective for that muscle
so i think this is a really good
question um i think people who
are somewhat familiar with the science
would say yes so
type 1 or slow twitch muscle fibers
would respond better
to high rep sets with light weights and
type 2 muscle fibers or fast switch
muscle fibers would respond better
to heavier weights for lower reps and i
used to think this too i remember when i
first got into training
i heard that the hamstrings were very
type 2 or fast twitch dominant
and so i was told you need to train them
with heavy weight for low reps
in reality i think this is all mostly
just a bunch of noise because
almost every muscle that we care about
developing
is pretty much an even split of type 1
in type 2. so like the quads are almost
a perfect 50 50 split
the hamstrings are slightly more type 2
dominant at least according to one study
but it's still like
60 40. so even on that logic of
allocating rep counts based on fiber
type distribution
you would still want to use a
combination of reps for the hamstrings
and pretty much every other muscle is
almost roughly even 50 50.
so practically speaking the best advice
is to not really worry about the muscle
fiber type
and just train with both high reps and
low reps
and probably most your work should come
in that middle rep range it's going to
hit a combination of both
now i want to say if you want to dig
into the science a little bit more
there's actually research showing that
type 1 so slow twitch muscle fibers
respond well to both high reps
and low reps so the mechanistic theory
doesn't really seem to work out when you
study it
over the long term and the same thing
goes for type 2 fibers respond well to
high reps
and low reps so using a combination is
almost always the best thing to do
one possible exception to that that i
actually apply in my own training
is the calves the soleus muscle which
sits under the gastroc muscle
um is according to some studies as much
as
90 percent type 1 or slow twitch
so that means if there's any theoretical
basis for using
higher reps in on type 1 dominant
muscles
it would apply to the soleus so if
you're training calves exclusively in
say i don't know the six to 12 rep range
you could be missing out on some calf
growth
and for me personally i'll usually do
pretty high reps
close to failure if not to failure on
seated
calf raises um they can be standing you
can do high reps on standing as well
they'll both target
the soleus but you want to make sure
you're doing some
sets that use reps at least 15
to 25 in there for your calf training i
think if you're going to give the theory
any merit at all you'd want to apply it
to the calves and everything else is
pretty much an even 50 50 split anyway
so
i don't think there's much there to
worry about to be honest okay i'm gonna
do one more really quick and then we're
gonna go do a workout so this one is
can you take creatine while losing fat
now i've talked about creatine
everything you need to know about
creatine i did it in another video but i
still get questions about
this almost every day so it means that
people are still a bit confused about
creatine
so creatine is stored almost exclusively
in muscle tissue
and to a lesser extent in the brain so
there's no reason why you'd want to stop
taking creatine while cutting
because any water retention that comes
as a result of creatine supplementation
is going to be inside the muscle or
maybe a little bit in the brain
so i actually don't know about that but
it's definitely going to be in the
muscle
not just kind of floating around under
your skin so it's not going to make you
look any more bloated or watery it's
just going to make your muscles fuller
which could actually have the opposite
effect it's going to cause your muscles
to push out against the skin a little
bit more
and probably result in a tighter
appearance so no you never need to come
off
creatine you can just take three to five
grams of creatine monohydrate a day
every day for the rest of your life it's
associated with a bunch of other
positive health effects
cognitive effects general metabolic
effects and
obviously increased strength and muscle
mass so it's a supplement that i
strongly endorse i mean it's not magical
it's not going to do everything under
the sun for you but it's definitely
worth taking
and there's decades of research showing
its safety and your body
doesn't grow desensitized to it so
unlike caffeine
which you'll become desensitized to over
time that doesn't happen with creatine
you can just treat it like
any other nutrient or any other
nutritive supplement like a protein
powder you can just take it every day
and just continue to take it and it
doesn't really matter about anything
else so
don't sweat those little details when it
comes to creatine it's pretty simple all
right that's gonna be wrap for this
segment of it i'm gonna go hit an arm
workout
and i will check in with you guys and
answer a couple more questions after
let's go
[Music]
so guys we just finished up with the arm
workout and
occasionally what i'll do there's this
outdoor basketball court in our
neighborhood here so
sometimes i'll come out here and shoot a
couple shots if i'm feeling good after
my workout so
that workout today wasn't too taxing
like i said it's mostly just
kind of the leftover muscles that i
didn't hit quite so much
throughout the week so get a little bit
of cardio in and
as i'm shooting i'll answer the rest of
the questions you guys got all right
this is a controversial question
are there any machines or exercises to
avoid for being injury prone
heard that bench press and hip abduction
machine are unsafe
um so this opinion
will bother some people but i think no i
don't think there are any exercises
that are inherently so harmful to the
point that you need to
avoid doing them generally speaking i
don't think there are any
contraindicated exercises i just think
there are contraindicated
people from certain exercises so for
example if you have
a history of knee pain it might not be a
good idea for you to do
a whole bunch of leg extensions but i
think the
bigger problem around this question is
that you have
so many personal trainers who are
telling you all these different
exercises that you shouldn't do
because they're dangerous and i think
that that can be a real problem because
it can instill the idea in people that
if they do this exercise
they're probably going to hurt
themselves and the general consensus
in the pain science and medical
community right now is that instilling
that fear in people
is more likely to be dangerous than the
exercise most likely is
on its own anyway it's something called
the nocebo effect
so most you guys have probably heard of
the placebo effect basically that's when
you give someone a sugar pill it doesn't
actually have any medicinal properties
but when they take it they suddenly
start to feel better because they
believe that it's working they were told
by some authority figure that it works
well the nocebo effect is kind of like
the inverse of that it's when someone
tells you this is going to
actively harm you and so you become so
psychologically fearful of it
that it does end up becoming more likely
to harm you or you
think that it's actually harming you
when it really isn't and i think this
happens
all the time in our community with so
many different exercises
with that said i think there are a few
things to be aware of and that you
should be mindful of
one is so called functional exercises so
exercises like
bosu ball squats bosu ball curls where
like you stand on a yoga ball
and do an exercise i'm not saying it
doesn't have
any application in any athletic context
but for the vast majority of people who
are just looking to build strength
and build size that's just increasing
the risk of the exercise without any
real additional benefit
if you want to get more functional get
stronger on basic compound movements
and that's going to improve your
functionality and pretty much any daily
activity that you probably do
and it'll be more effective at building
size and strength so i'd like to see a
lot more people
training with stable surfaces rather
than unstable surfaces i talked about
that in another video um
and when it comes to dangerous exercises
i would say the most dangerous exercises
are the ones that you attach your ego to
that can really be any exercise but for
a lot of people like you said in
the question it does end up being an
exercise like the bench press and that's
because people get so obsessed with
improving their numbers on the lift
that they let their technique slip or
they handle weights that they can't
really handle with good form
and that's when exercises become
problematic so i don't think that there
are any exercises that you
specifically need to avoid everyone's
biomechanics and anatomy is a little bit
different
so it really does come down to
self-experimentation
but i think it's a kind of bad mindset
to go into the gym with the expectation
that there's these exercises over here
that i really need to avoid because
they're going to mess me up and these
exercises are really good
all the common exercises that we do i
think are safe
and can be included in any complete
routine all right so guys as i was
shooting
the loudest cockroach or cricket of all
time
started cricketing so you guys might
have heard that in the last question
anyway i'm going to finish off
two more questions and we're going to
wrap it up any suggestions for how to
fit playing basketball or a cardio
intensive sport around a linear
progression program or novice lifting
program with a strength focus
so i'm gonna try to answer this as
quickly as i can anytime you're trying
to balance
cardio and strength training you need to
think of
three main factors frequency so how
often are you doing cardio
intensity how intense is it and the mode
so the more often and the more intense
and the higher the impact of the cardio
the more likely it is to interfere
so you take something like swimming or
even cycling
those are very low impact cardio
activities so you can probably get away
with
a higher frequency and a higher
intensity on those and not have it
interfere with your training
basketball is actually pretty high
impact so you want to have
a slightly lower frequency and maybe a
lower intensity
so for me when i play basketball i try
to limit it to
maybe two or three times a week and i
don't
play all that hard like i'm usually just
shooting around by myself especially now
with
covet and everything so those are just
variables that you need to try to
moderate
for yourself and as you think about
those factors
you need to assess your own recovery so
are you still progressing if you're on a
linear program
and you're still getting stronger week
to week then you're probably not over
doing it with cardio but if on the other
hand you notice that your progression
is slowing down maybe you're feeling a
little bit banged up all the time you're
more sore than usual your joints are a
little achy
maybe you're also not sleeping as well
maybe your motivation is a little bit
lower
that could be an indication that you're
putting too much of a demand on your
body
and you need to reduce one of those
outputs so maybe
pulling back on the cardio once a week
or maybe reducing the intensity of the
cardio would be a good idea
you can always switch to lower impact
cardio as well but if there's a sport
that you
play or that you like more than others
like me then sometimes you just have to
deal with the higher
impact nature of it so i'll leave it at
that for that question
um let's see okay when's the power
building program coming out
i probably am going to need another
month to get all the content ready for
that
i'm trying to make it by far my best
program that i've ever launched it's
going to be
super comprehensive there's going to be
more that comes with it than just the
the program i'm really trying to make
this one something special so i'm taking
my time with it
i think in about a month maybe a little
more it should be
ready to go but i'll let you guys know
and i might do a pre-order with it as
well
but i'll definitely make sure i blast it
out everywhere okay i'm gonna finish
with this question
who's meeting in the nba finals and
who's taking it i think it's gonna be
the toronto raptors and the la lakers
i think the raptors are gonna win in six
games so i'm
i'm sticking to that i know you guys are
gonna hate but i've gotta i've gotta
support my raptors
on this one if it wasn't gonna be the
wrap if i wasn't super biased in favor
of the raptors i'd probably say
milwaukee and the clippers i don't wanna
say the clippers though because i know
the raptors will have a harder time
beating the clippers
i could also see the denver nuggets
being a sleeper pick
dallas mavericks are playing really well
um and out of the east the celtics could
be
an option as well but i'm hoping it's
raptors versus lakers because i think
the raptors could actually take the
lakers
it's possible and i would love to see
the raptors win so
i'm gonna leave it there if you guys
enjoyed the video please leave it a
thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
already
and i will see you guys all here in
another video very soon
