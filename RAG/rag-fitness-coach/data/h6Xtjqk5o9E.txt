hey folks it's me dr mike for
renaissance periodization and did you
know that regular supplements that you
can buy at the health store can help you
lose tons of weight oh no wait that's
not true that's bs but how come hmm
well
let's take this step by step there are
really two
fundamental
routes for weight loss
consume less food
accidental middle finger
and or burn more calories okay
so if you're going to get supplements at
the store
they might be able to help you with
increasing calorie burning somehow
and potentially helping you consume less
food but how does taking more pills get
you take in less food almost always is
going to come from a reduction in hunger
signaled by those supplements that
you're taking which can be very helpful
at the health store
which supplements have a robust
notable
real world effect that makes a big
difference in your weight loss results
on either
how much calories you're burning how
many calories you're burning rather
and or how much food you're taking in
via hunger well the answer is
supplements with stimulants in them
and that's really kind of it
non-stimulant thermogenics
big fucking joke
and supplements that reliably reduce
your hunger
they just
don't have them at the health store
in
almost any case
but hold on a sec
i walk into the supplement store and
there's hundreds and potentially
thousands of different pills and potions
and powders
they do something yes
that can help me lose weight
the answer is the vast majority of those
unless like whey protein casein protein
creatine etc those big blockbuster items
they actually
don't help you do diddly dick as dr
james hoffman would say and that really
just sucks
so like you know when you go buy stuff
at the health food store unless it's a
vitamin or mineral or phytochemical or a
supplement like creatine protein
stimulants
all those weird supplements with weird
names they almost always do nothing at
all
they do make you poorer because you give
away your money to have them
that being said
supplements
do exist that can radically reduce your
hunger and thus food intake and have
been research confirmed to allow people
to lose oodles and oils of weight the
most advanced of these
are the glp
agonists
and
somaglite is i think a generation iii
drug that is now available to the wide
market with a prescription so you can't
find it at the health store
unfortunately but it works really well
but it's not at the health store
so we go back to the health store
we don't find a lot of supplements there
that aren't stimulant based that can
help us lose a lot of weight and a lot
of fat and if they're stimulant-based
they can help us lose weight and fat a
little bit towards the end of our fat
loss journeys but they can't sustainably
either boost energy expenditure or
reduce hunger in such a way that makes a
big impact and also you can get
stimulants anywhere
not just the health food store you can
just have like a monster in the morning
and a monster in the afternoon and
that's it also coffee also tea
the health food store is great for all
kinds of stuff
probably not great to try to find
miracle magical supplements that'll help
you lose lots of weight and
unfortunately a lot of people go into
the health food store for precisely that
reason what they should be doing
is going to the doctor's office and
saying hey doc
i was wondering about this
thing called samagletide i read an
article in the new york times
um also known as ozempic or wigovi who
the fuck means these drugs jesus
that shit is effective as fuck and it
seems to be super safe and it's amazing
and if i was paid by big pharma to say
this i still would
and even though i'm not being paid i
still am
folks
sorry to bust these bubbles and myths
and bullshit as arnold would say but
it's just that's just our job here at rp
deflating your hopes and dreams
and giving you banal difficult ways in
order for you to get into shape
gee that's a bad selling point i should
come up with something better folks i'm
gonna go think about that see you next
time
