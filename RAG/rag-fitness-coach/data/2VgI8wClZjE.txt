i've previously discussed if flexing
between sets could enhance muscle growth
concluding that overall it did not seem
to help build more muscle
but what about stretching in between
sets
this isn't a new idea legendary
bodybuilder frank zane states he used to
stretch the primary muscle group worked
in an
exercise for 15 seconds between sets
but what does the current research say
on stretching in between sets
can it help build more muscle a study by
evangelista and colleagues
aimed to determine just this 29
untrained men
were assigned to either a stretching
group or a non-stretching group
both groups trained the same exercises
the bench press
seated row seated dip machine biceps
curl
leg extension and leg curl
each for four sets of eight to twelve
reps each set taken to failure
twice per week for eight weeks the
non-stretching group rested 90 seconds
between
sets the stretching group also rested 90
seconds between
sets but during 30 of those seconds they
held a static stretch
between sets of the bench press they
performed a stretch for the chest and
front delts
between sets of the seated row they
performed a stretch for the lats
between sets of the seated dip machine
they performed a stretch for the triceps
between sets of the biceps curl they
performed a stretch for the biceps
between sets of the leg extension they
performed a stretch for the quadriceps
between sets of the leg curl they
performed a stretch for the hamstrings
as a note all stretches were performed
with the maximum range of motion
participants could achieve pain-free
thickness of the elbow flexors which
would have included the biceps bracha
and brachialis
triceps brachii rectus femoris and
vastus lateralis
was measured before and after the a
weeks for both groups
although there were no statistically
significant differences in elbow flexor
triceps and rectus femoris thickness
between both groups
it is evident that the results do
slightly favor the stretching group
a longer study or more participants
could result in these differences being
significant
for vastus lateralis thickness the
stretching group did experience
statistically significant greater
increases compared to the non-stretching
group
so overall i would say this study
suggests that stretching in between
sets may indeed help build more muscle
the reasons as to why stretching in
between sets helps build more muscle in
this study are not clear
and i think much more research would be
needed to confirm these results
and identify the potential mechanisms
anyway it's important to consider the
context of this evangelista study when
interpreting the results the
participants were untrained
training responses do differ between
trained and untrained individuals
so it's not clear whether these results
would apply to trained individuals
the participants also held the stretches
with a maximum range of motion they
could achieve pain-free
this is probably a noteworthy point as
previous research by junior and
colleagues
found that performing a quadricep
stretch that was painful for the
participants
before leg extensions resulted in less
vastus lateralis growth compared to
performing only the leg extensions
although this was stretching before
training it's very possible that
performing intense stretching in between
sets
could reduce muscle growth too
furthermore
the participants in their evangelista
and colleague study held the stretches
for 30 seconds
holding stretches for longer than this
could be counterproductive
for instance seattle's and colleagues
found that stretching the quadriceps for
60 seconds
resulted in greater decreases in
quadriceps force output
compared to stretching for 30 seconds
this more pronounced force loss with 60
seconds of stretching
could mean the quadriceps receive less
of a hypertrophic stimulus
though i am guessing here and future
research would be needed to validate
this idea
lastly at this current moment this is
the only published research paper to
have assessed the effects of stretching
in between sets on muscle hypertrophy
now i did actually find details about an
unpublished paper by silva and
colleagues
assessing how stretching in between sets
impacts hypertrophy
this paper was presented at a conference
only in summary
here are the details 24 trained men
were assigned to either a stretching or
non-stretching group both groups
performed four sets of eight to twelve
reps of calf raises on the leg press
machine
during the rest intervals the stretching
group allowed the leg press machine
weight to stretch their gastrocnemius
so i think they had their feet
dorsiflexed on the leg press machine
here
the results showed that the stretching
group experienced greater increases in
gastrocnemius thickness compared to the
non-stretching group
although these results are interesting
especially as this study was supposedly
done on trained individuals
these results should be taken cautiously
simply because the study was never
published and peer reviewed
to wrap up the evangelista and colleague
study
provides us with evidence that
stretching in between sets could help
build more muscle
albeit for untrained individuals
ultimately
regardless of your training experience
you may wish to experiment with
stretching in between sets and see how
it works out for you
of course it's going to be difficult if
not impossible
to actually figure out if it's helping
you build more muscle but if you enjoy
it
and you ensure stretches are held for 30
seconds or less
and at a comfortable intensity i think
at the very least there would be no
downside
but again this is me just guessing based
on a single study
additionally you could implement
stretching in between sets for only a
few select movements
or you could have intermittent training
blocks where you implement stretching in
between sets
at the end of the day i really do hope
more papers assess this topic
especially in trained individuals so we
can truly find out if stretching between
sets enhances hypertrophy if any new
papers come out
i do definitely plan to make videos on
[Music]
them
