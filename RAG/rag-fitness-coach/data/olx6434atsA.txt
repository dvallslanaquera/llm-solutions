stop making assumptions about your
genetics before you've even put in the
work
forget about the sarms and the
testosterone get out there
train hard eat properly stick to natural
supplements do it consistently for
several years
and see where you can go with it
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i'm going to be reacting to
a recent video from greg doucet
titled best supplements for ectomorphs
now supplements can be a tricky topic
because
while there are a select few supplements
out there that genuinely can help you
out with your fitness program
the vast majority of supplements
probably like 90 to 95
plus are really just straight up
ineffective and as flashy and aggressive
as all the supplement marketing out
there can get
with all these different youtubers and
fitness influencers trying to shove a
million different products down your
throat
most of what's out there really is just
a waste of money and so you really need
to do
the proper research first and this is an
area that i've put
a very substantial amount of time into
researching over the course of many
years
and i own a supplement line as well and
have pretty good insight into how the
industry works so this is a subject that
i can definitely
help out with and there's an even
broader point that i wanted to address
in this video okay this goes beyond just
supplements but also into the whole idea
of
giving recommendations based on somebody
being an ectomorph
so i highly suggest that everybody watch
this video just for the supplement
information
but if you're naturally thin and you
consider yourself to be a hard gainer
then i think that you should especially
watch this so
which parts of greg's video do i agree
with and which parts do i disagree with
let's go over it coach greg and today
we're going to be going over the best
supplements
that ectomorphs can take so what exactly
is an ectomorph an ectomorph is one of
the three general body types or
somatotypes that people could be
ectomorphs tend to be thinner and have a
harder time putting on muscle
if this is you these are the best
supplements that you should take so
first off keep in mind that
the whole somatotype theory in general
is a pretty outdated approach
that just isn't really of much practical
use it was actually created
by a psychologist named william sheldon
back in the 1940s
where he was trying to draw connections
between people's body type and their
behavioral trait
obviously there are people out there who
are naturally skinny who have a harder
time
gaining muscle and who do fit the
traditional ectomorph profile
but ultimately body types operate on a
spectrum
which greg does mention in the video and
even within people who might have a
similar body shape where you might look
at them and think
that's an ectomorph that's a mesomorph
and that's an endomorph there's still
going to be a lot of variation there in
terms of
uh each person's specific muscle
building capabilities their leanness
their body fat distribution training
tolerance
so being a particular somatotype doesn't
really tell us much
if anything in terms of how that person
should specifically choose their
supplements or their training program or
their diet
it really just comes down to the
individual in terms of their current
body composition
how they respond to training and
nutrition and what their specific
fitness goals are
but let's go ahead and dive into the
actual supplement list here
number one creatine by adding creatine
to your supplement list
you might be able to perform an extra
rep at the end of your set
if it allows you to train harder than
last time it's gonna allow you to get
more gains
so no argument there creatine is uh no
doubt the most effective
natural supplement for muscle building
purposes there's tons of research
supporting it going back several decades
and if your goal is to
maximize training performance and
maximize muscle growth then it's
definitely worth including in your
program
for that small extra boost that it can
give unless you are a creatine
non-responder
who doesn't get any benefit from it
which is true for a certain percentage
of people so just take three to five
grams of creatine monohydrate per day
there's no need to buy into any of these
more expensive advanced creatine forms
that some of these
so-called supplement experts try to sell
you for eight times the cost of regular
monohydrate
you can mix your creatine monohydrate
with anything you want you can take it
at any time of day
and there's no need to creatine load or
to creatine cycle or
anything fancy like that number two thc
that's good old marijuana weed yeah
that's right it made the list
if you take marijuana edibles it can
help you sleep during the night
and when you sleep you can recover and
grow muscle so just to be clear i have
nothing whatsoever against thc
consumption in general whether you want
to smoke it
vape it eat it take it rectally or
whatever you want okay when i was in
high school i
consumed thc in moderation on and off
like a lot of teenagers do and i'd say
that all things equal if your training
in your diet
is otherwise on point i don't think thc
is going to
negatively affect your gains so if
you're already a thc user as is and you
enjoy it and you get some sort of
benefit from it then that's fine
but if you're currently not a thc user i
wouldn't recommend that you go out of
your way to start using it as some kind
of bodybuilding supplement
thinking that it's going to improve your
gains so the first reason that greg
gives
is that it will help you sleep better
which will then improve your recovery
and yeah sleep is obviously very
important for a wide variety of reasons
for
body composition purposes overall health
functioning training performance
but there's actually a decent amount of
research showing that even though thc
might help you fall asleep faster
it actually can reduce your overall
sleep quality because it interferes
with rem sleep now there is some mixed
research on that and probably there is
some
individual variation as well but that's
just something to keep in mind
because it very well might actually make
your sleep worse not only that if you're
someone who has a hard time getting food
down
tichi it's been shown to give you the
munchies a little
make you eat more and with more food you
can get
bigger so yeah thc does have an appetite
stimulating effect for most people
but again i would say that it's just
kind of an extreme recommendation
for something uh very simple like this
you know if you're having trouble
getting in all the calories you need for
the day
you don't need to go and get high and
alter your whole mental state just so
that you can eat more all you really
need to do is adjust your diet slightly
by increasing your consumption of high
calorie dense foods okay when you're
trying to lose fat you want to focus on
low calorie dense foods
and when you're trying to gain weight if
you can't get in enough calories
then you want to focus on high calorie
dense foods and the easiest way to do
that is just by upping your fat intake
since fats have twice the calorie
density of protein and carbs i mean if
you literally just add
one tablespoon of olive oil to a meal
which isn't much at all
that's 120 extra calories right there so
you can consume
healthy oils nuts nut butters avocado
coconut milk or you can just make
a homemade high calorie shake you can
easily make an 800 to 1200 calorie shake
with just a few basic ingredients start
with some milk coconut milk is even
better because it's really calorie dense
add some protein powder some oats banana
peanut butter uh maybe a bit of frozen
yogurt or even some ice cream and you
can even mix in some healthy oil on top
of that as well and you won't even taste
it
i used to do this all the time i'd make
just a big ass homemade weight gainer
shake
and i'd add olive oil and flax seed oil
on top of it and it tasted great
and was really easy to get down after my
solid food meals
but bottom line here is that you don't
need a big calorie surplus to gain
muscle in the first place a couple
hundred calories above maintenance
is going to be enough for most people
and that's pretty easy to hit for most
people as well
and if you're still having issues
reaching that amount just add some high
calorie dense foods into the mix
you don't need thc for this beta alanine
this can increase your exercise capacity
in particular
for strenuous bouts of up to a minute
beta alanine
doesn't improve performance for
exercises lasting up to one minute so
it's not
zero to 60 seconds where you're getting
the benefit beta alanine improves your
performance for exercises that last at
least one minute and then it starts
assisting you beyond that point
and that's an important distinction
because for most people most of their
sets are not going to be lasting for
more than 60 seconds and even if they do
beta alanine still only gives you a
couple percent boost at best
so i definitely wouldn't uh categorize
beta alanine as a best supplement for
gaining muscle
because unless you're training in really
high rep ranges then
from a muscle building standpoint it's
not really going to help you at all as
it
buffers lactic acid you can go harder
than last time you could sprint
further on your bike you might get an
extra rep small point but
just to be pedantic beta allen
technically doesn't buffer lactic acid
it actually buffers hydrogen ions
uh which is a bit different but in any
case what i would say is that
if you're a competitive athlete where a
small one to two percent increase in
performance is worth it for you
then beta alanine supplementation could
make sense if you're doing a lot of
intensive cardio then it might help
there as well
or if you do regularly train in high rep
ranges
on sets lasting more than 60 seconds
then that's also fine
but for the average lifter out there
who's training in
standard hypertrophy rep ranges i would
say that beta alanine probably isn't
going to do much for you
if anything i have recommended it in the
past as a sort of
second tier supplement and i still think
it's okay to use just as long as you're
aware of the fact that it's pretty
borderline stuff
but i don't use it personally and i
don't include it as an ingredient
in any of our real science athletic
supplements because i think that for the
general population
it's really just not worth it all right
now moving on to greg's
next two supplements on the list i'm
going to group these two together
because i have the same general thing to
say about it
the first one is mk677
it has been shown to increase hunger
stimulate your appetite
and increase the rate and the speed of
muscle growth
it can increase igf-1 levels in the body
and so
consider it to be kind of like an oral
growth hormone
and the second one is testosterone
if you're an ectomorph don't expect that
you're going to be able to get jacked
and huge
just by taking a bunch of natural
supplements testosterone is going to
dramatically
help build muscle at an accelerated rate
now i'm
fully aware of the fact that it's not
greg's intention to broadly recommend
this stuff to his audience
he said before in past videos that he
thinks that most people should probably
stay
natural to do your own research to talk
to a doctor he does put disclaimers in
this video as well
but remember testosterone is unsafe
there's a lot of negative things that
can happen if you take it so
be careful research harder than last
time and only use it with the advice of
a doctor
so i don't think for one second that he
thinks that anybody who's an ectomorph
should just hop
on uh sarms and testosterone so let's
make that clear
but the one thing that i did want to
comment on is just going back to the
whole ectomorph thing in general because
the way the video kind of comes across
to me and i think the way that a lot of
newbie lifters out there might take it
it's kind of like
if you're an ectomorph and you want to
get jacked then you're basically screwed
since your genetics are crap and this is
kind of the route that you're going to
have to go down if you want to get
really impressive results
without testosterone chances are getting
huge
very small this is for ectomorphs not
telling you you should use it just
saying it would clearly help a lot if
you did
now yeah no question whatsoever genetics
do play a big role in the muscle
building process i've talked about that
many times before
and yeah some people out there genuinely
are going to have a harder time putting
on muscle and they're going to have less
total muscle building potential and if
you do have below
average genetics and you want to get
truly huge and jacked
then in the long term peds might be
required to do that
depending on what your definition of
huge and jacked is
but at the same time i just want to
hammer home the point that in most cases
as a beginner you don't really know what
your genetics are
until you've actually put in the work
over a consistent extended period of
time
you know there's a lot of guys out there
who are going to see a video like this
and they're going to think
well i'm naturally skinny so that means
i'm an ectomorph i'm a hard gainer
so basically i'm [ __ ] unless i start
using gear
your genetics suck you chose the wrong
parent sorry to break it to you and
there's nothing that irks me more
than all these young guys nowadays who
get into lifting and they're just
jumping straight onto peds like it's
nothing
without seeing where they can take their
body naturally first and without paying
their dues and i'm sure greg would
ultimately agree with this
so if you want to use peds at some point
down the line that's completely up to
you
but if you are gonna do it max out your
natural potential first okay put in at
least
five solid years of natural lifting
minimum to see where you can take your
body and to see how you feel about
things
once you've put that muscle on because
your perspective might change at that
point
and taking peds you know especially
something like testosterone
that's a very serious body altering
decision it's not something to just do
on a whim
or on impulse because you want fast
results and you've decided that you're
doomed from the start
because of your genetics because if
you're naturally skinny now and you
think that you're an ectomorph
you might still be able to build a very
solid natural physique
there's no set definition for what an
ectomorph is in the first place
and just because you're starting out
with less baseline muscle mass
that doesn't mean that you won't still
respond decently well to training
i started training pretty young but if
you asked me when i first started
what i thought my genetics were for
bodybuilding i would have thought that
they were [ __ ] you know i was naturally
thin
i had small wrists tiny ankles visible
ribs my clavicles were kind of poking
out you know i really thought i was an
ectomorph i thought i was a hard gainer
and my initial goal was just to be an
average size i wasn't even trying to get
big
i was just aiming to not be skinny so
here's me at 13 years old
this is the best picture that i have
from that time before i started training
but then here i am just before turning
16. so this was two and a half years of
training and i wasn't even using any
supplements at all here
besides protein powder so it turned out
that i actually have pretty good
genetics for bodybuilding you know i'm
not the biggest guy around
but i was able to put on muscle fairly
well and my
overall structural genetics in terms of
muscle shape and muscle insertions
that all turned out to be pretty good
and that might not be the case for you
but it also might be so if you're still
a novice then forget this stupid
ectomorph hard gainer label
stop making assumptions about your
genetics before you've even put in the
work
forget about the sarms and the
testosterone get out there
train hard eat properly stick to natural
supplements do it consistently for
several years
and see where you can go with it because
again even if you're naturally thin
right now you might still be able to
gain muscle just fine even if you don't
think that that's the case
number six protein bars
you want to have protein four to five
times a day because
every time you eat protein it allows you
an opportunity to have
muscle protein synthesis to occur so
sure protein bars are protein powder
either one is fine
i'm not gonna have any special unique
muscle building benefits but it's just a
way to help you get in more protein for
the day
in a convenient form now greg recommends
uh four to five individual protein
feedings per day
and yeah if you want 100 absolute
maximum hypertrophy then that
recommendation would make sense but also
keep in mind
that this whole thing operates on a
pretty steep diminishing returns curve
as well as far as
protein feedings per day so as long as
you're getting enough total protein for
the day as a whole
that's the most important thing by far
and then if you're splitting that up
into
at least three individual feedings then
you're probably very close to being
maxed out at that point already but
um if you do want that last few possible
percent of gains
then yeah you can increase to the four
to five feedings per day and protein
supplements can definitely help you out
with that
pre-workout i know you're thinking oh no
you got to avoid those stims because it
decreases your appetite and you got to
stay off the stims
it's not the case don't abuse them don't
overdo it but pre-workout is going to
help you train
harder than last time so last on the
list here is pre-workout which i would
say is
not a mandatory supplement but it's
something that you can use as an
optional add-on
if your goal is to fully maximize your
workout performance and if you enjoy the
extra physical and mental kick
that a properly formulated pre-workout
can give you now this is an area where
you need to choose very carefully
because a very high percentage of
popular pre-workouts out there
really just don't make the cut okay they
usually include a bunch of ingredients
that aren't backed by good research
and they're just kind of randomly mashed
together in low doses that really won't
do much of anything for you beyond
the caffeine that's there so don't just
take things at face value because the
marketing seems convincing
do your research first and if you do
want to check out pure form which is our
real science athletics pre-workout

is the optimal combination of
ingredients
