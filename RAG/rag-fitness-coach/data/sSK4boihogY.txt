84 000 calories day man I'm not gaining
weight what's going on but like what
you're not gaining weight so you're not
in a surplus that's what's going on no
mystery you have to eat more
hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization let's talk about common
mistakes in muscle gain dieting you want
to get huge you want to get jacked You
Want To Get Swole you want to get yoked
you want to get
cock diesel
I never liked that term why are we
saying cock so much folks let's take it
easy
how many mistakes do I have listed here
10 10 Common muscle gain diet mistakes
not training mistakes but diet mistakes
you want to gain muscle and you're
eating in a certain way but you could be
making some of these mistakes let's make
sure you're not mistake number one is
not knowing your maintenance and thus
being mathematically unable to generate
a surplus because you have no idea what
your maintenance is by definition of
surplus is something above maintenance
but if you don't know this part how the
hell do you know what to eat in order to
have a surplus
this seems like a make-believe common
mistake that I made up just to be able
to have some filler in a YouTube video
to get more ads out of it but I swear to
God it's not true and you guys have been
in the gym many many years you know it's
not true because people talk to you in
the gym and they say shit like this
they'd be like yeah man just trying to
fuck you get these gains you know and
you're like that's right man you know
like you're between sets of hacks block
you have nothing literally you're
imprisoned you have nowhere to go except
talk to the person who just started
talking to you
and they're like yeah man it's all about
diet right you're like yeah that's right
man diet's super important and then you
make the mistake of getting curious and
you go what what's your diet like you
want to help somebody if I'm just trying
to eat you know what I'm saying I'm like
ah
ah to quote one of our good friends ah
so how do you know if you're eating
enough
nobody lost nobody found no question
asked no question answered you gotta
have an understanding of Maintenance
before you generate a surplus how do you
do this you try to monitor your food
intake
the just even just the three macros
proteins carbs fats every day even just
calories every day for one or two weeks
eat relatively normal and just eat how
you always eat and which I assume you
just normally have a roughly a
maintenance of body weight and then you
get a value out of that so 3 500
calories and then you go from there
critical clothing and if you don't do
this and you're not gaining muscle that
you want there's no mystery because how
the hell would you know if eating enough
Point number two mistake number two
is not setting a surplus
and actually sticking to it
if you want to gain muscle a surplus is
critical
because can you gain tame yes for a time
but once you get sufficiently lean or
sufficiently well trained containing
either works way way not as good as
muscle gain on purpose gaining weight
having eating a surplus or it just
doesn't work at all
so if you have a surplus that you've
generated say you know your maintenance
is 3000 calories you're not making that
first mistake and then you generate a
surplus of 300 calories per day on
average so 3 300 calories is what you're
eating
you have to get to that Surplus and you
have to stick to it
if you don't have a target of how many
calories you have to eat
then you just can train hard for weeks
and weeks and be accidentally at
maintenance or accidentally in a small
deficit and actually Gain No muscle at
all imagine eating protein and getting
into the gym and getting hard workouts
and doing all the things and at the end
of 12 weeks the reality is you didn't
really put on any muscle because you
simply didn't eat enough that's so dumb
it's so wasteful and it's so easy to
stop
mistake number three
not measuring your weight
getting on the scale regularly
and thus not knowing
if you are in a surplus
the way to find out because here's the
thing
even if you do Point number two set a
surplus and stick to it
that's all theoretical
you assume that you're roughly correct
in your measurement of the maintenance
30 000 calories
you assume that you have imposed 3300
Surplus but remember food labels are off
Often by as much as 20 percent or more
remember that your thermogenesis is
different based on different times of
the year different hormonal States how
much you walk around versus not if
you're tracking your steps exactly yes
Communist Party of China I know exactly
where I am at all times
um all these things change and your
assumption that you're in a surplus may
be incorrect you mean you get a bigger
Surplus than you thought you were and
you'd be gaining too much fat you may be
in a smaller Surplus than you thought
you were not gaining as much muscle as
you like you may not be in a surplus at
all
how do you fundamentally
know that you're in a surplus the
assumption is good but you got to know
some stuff about it just like you know
if you're like in a war and you're
firing rockets at something you can
assume that you got the coordinates
right but simply it's probably good to
look at the satellite imaging to see if
you're hitting anything and if you're
not looks like your assumptions are
wrong very simple concept which lots of
people just end up not doing so then you
get the following social media question
which I get all the time and I'm sure
you guys get a bunch yourselves is like
hey man I've been eating insert calorie
number here that sounds impressive to
that person four thousand calories being
4 000 calories a day man I'm not gaining
weight what's going on but like what
what's going on
you're not gaining weight
so you're not in a surplus
that's what's going on no mystery you
have to eat more but that person already
did a really good thing they're saying
they're not gaining weight some people
will say even less let's say I'm eating
a 4 000 calories a day but I don't think
I'm getting any bigger or stronger oh I
got you has your weight been going up
over time
and some people will be like well I'm
not sure folks no bueno you want to do
the shit right and it's not that hard
what you have to do is measure body
weight
probably every day or every other day
get a nice weekly average going
Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can do
this for you with minimum effort you
don't even have to download the RP diet
coach app Shameless plug
and it's totally good to go and if
you're gaining weight after roughly the
appropriate rate you're awesome you're
golden you're doing everything right but
if you're not you can fix it if you're
not weighing yourself regularly you
cannot possibly be legitimately confused
about what's going on you can be
illegitimately confused which means
confused for no good reason
next
people sometimes impose a surplus
and they'll detect even how much weight
they're gaining but they won't change it
at the margins when they know there's
something wrong
so people will say yeah man I've been
gaining two pounds a week for the last
few weeks is that good what do you think
I think it's too much I'm getting too
fat what should I do
reduce the Surplus and then you get into
that weird fear that mostly guys have of
that if they have a certain Surplus and
they're gaining it too fast of a rate
and getting too fat they think that
dialing that Surplus down is the same
logical equivalent as just going into a
deficit remember a slower rate of gain
is still a rate of gain and in many
cases it's a rate of game that's leaner
and healthier and all the good things so
if you're eating 4 000 calories a day
and you're getting too fat and you know
that shit
you don't have to go back to 3000 and go
back to maintenance you could just go to
3 500 or even 37.50 if you're really
you're super reverse to getting slow and
then you can make that adjustment
another thing
is this works in both directions
people will set a surplus they'll
monitor their weight and they'll do shit
like this uh this is more of on average
a female problem a female mistake
they'll say 2000 is my Baseline
maintenance 2300 is what I'm going to
eat at
and they eat at 2300 but they uh it's
summer time now and they're getting more
steps and they're getting more muscular
so their metabolism is increasing a
little bit their training is on a new
level it's super hard and they also
picked up like a recreational hobby
they're playing tennis with Grandma a
few times a week
and they started at 130 pounds and then
they're at 130 and that they're at 130
and that 130 and that 129 and they're
not 132 and they're at 129 again they're
not 131 they're at 130 and that's like a
few multiple weeks of weight average are
summed up
they're not gaining weight
no matter what they're not actually at a
surplus or a very very small one of that
so many people in that situation
will be like uh you know yeah like this
is going on I imposed a surplus
and they'll do this they'll go I'm not
gaining weight but my training is going
really well and I feel like I'm getting
bigger so I'm just going to keep it here
for XYZ amount of time
folks the purpose of a muscle gain phase
is to gain muscle the absolute best no
debate way to do that is to gain weight
I don't mean 50 pounds a fucking day I
mean half a pound per week
pound per week something minimal but if
you're not seeing that in your averages
you have to eat more food and I know you
may be averse that idea and you may
think well there's some stuff going on
under the hood body water I'm still
getting tissue and you may be right you
may still be getting tissue but much
less tissue than you could be gaining
if you weren't playing so goddamn much
you actually ate more food and yes it's
going to be uncomfortable I had a
situation in my last Mass phase I'm on
an active rest right now
where I was eating 4 500 calories per
day which to me is a lot of food it's
fucking annoying
and my weight chart showed me that I
should actually be eating more like 4
700 if I'm going to gain the weight I
need to I didn't want to hear that shit
fuck man I can barely eat anything at
all I'm on fucking insulin and this and
that to try to eat more food it's awful
but that shit is real life and I have to
be honest with myself and change my
Surplus if my weight data isn't showing
me that I'm gaining as fast and I know
this sounds pedantic as fuck but people
do it all the time even I considered it
I told myself yeah yeah shit's still
happening under the hood I'm like I'm
still gaining muscle somehow bullshit
yeah somehow but I'm not here to gain
muscle somehow I'm here to do a real
good job and that means being
uncomfortable when the time calls for
number five
using weekly individuals sorry using
single data points daily data points of
body weight versus weekly averages
weekly averages tell you the story of
what's happening with your tissue
muscle and fat your actual body of
molecules that are not water
daily fluctuations tell you a body water
story
so some people will impose a surplus
and two or three days later they'll gain
five pounds and they go fuck fuck fuck
oh my God I'm just getting super fat
doing this hold on
what is the weekly average tell us I'm
like well I don't know yet it hasn't
been a week well then shut the fuck up
and do what you're supposed to for a
week now after a week of Weights you get
a weekly average your last week maybe
you weighed 179 pounds you went up to
187 on Wednesday of this week but then
your weight cooled off and you realize
it was just a bunch of Chinese food had
tons of salt in it and you get as low as
177 on Friday
the weekend goes normally and it turns
out that at the end of this week your
weekly weight average is 179.2
you gain 0.2 pounds
slow clap not terrible it's the start of
something definitely you know likely in
a surplus it's not the end of the world
but you remember or the same person that
on Wednesday because of that super high
weigh-in from just one weird day of body
water you wanted to pull back the
Surplus if you pulled it back and mind
you this is near and dear to my heart
that's why I'm so passionate I've done
all these things before made all these
mistakes you pull that Surplus down and
at the end of the week you actually lose
weight and you're like oh fuck what did
I do wrong and the answer is you should
have stuck to the process
trust the process you don't need to
trust it trust but verify and that
verify takes one week of Wheat averages
and then you know what's going on and
then the next week you'll know better
what's going on if you cannot plug and
play if you cannot assume that you're
taking a good guess and be patient
enough to wait one whole week to modify
your results this whole game is not for
you just I can go
Scott the video guy what are kids doing
nowadays that's not bodybuilding
Tick Tock go on Tick Tock and make a
dancing video where you think that
people watching your dances because
you're a good dancer but really they're
just touching themselves
are we allowed to say that on YouTube
we'll find out
time to get canceled all right
next
your weekly average could be good but
your pulsatility can be extreme your
body gains muscle best when every day
more or less you present a small Surplus
just enough extra food to feed the
muscles not so much extra food to feed
the fat a ton
weekly average one pound of gain hey
success there is another way to gain a
pound on average
early in the week you run a deficit
small deficit you lose some fat but you
barely build any muscle or not at all
second half of the week
Thursday Friday Saturday Etc weekend
you generate like an enormous Surplus
you lost a little bit of fat earlier in
the week didn't gain much less
later the week you introduce this huge
Surplus and you gain a fox zillion
amount of fat because huge surpluses
almost always go mostly to fat
your muscle
you gain a little bit of muscle towards
the end of that week because the Surplus
after a certain number of extras
calories probably anything north of 500
calories almost all the rest of the
calories just go straight to fat and
only a certain amount your muscle tops
out really quick for how much it can
accept and utilize and grow
so if you're a little bit of a deficit
here and a huge Surplus here yes the
average weight gain is going to be
whatever a pound but a very small
fraction of that is muscle because much
of the week you weren't even gaining
muscle and the other part of the week
you're gaining mostly fat
that kind of possibility can
really elude you because on the weekly
averages you're doing just fine but it
turns out that much of the week because
you're not eating enough you're not
taking the opportunity to gain muscle
and the other half of the week you're
eating too much and you're getting too
much fat
it sucks it sucks but the best way to
gain muscle is consistently presenting a
small average Surplus day in day week
and week out and this like idea that
like one day you eat 2 000 calories for
maintenance is three thousand in another
day you eat you know seven thousand and
it all averages out to be okay it's
really just a recipe for on the first
day not getting a lot of muscle and on
the second day gaining a shitload of
disproportionate fat so try to if your
diet looks like this
try to get it a little bit more like
this yeah sure it's okay to eat a little
bit more on the weekends yeah it's okay
to under eat a little bit in the early
in the week but if you really really
make that extreme you're missing out
next
eating mostly junk I mean this is the
what's the meme for this the dreamer
bulk or whatever I'm not sure sounds
like a nightmare block to me but you
know you're over dieted and you you got
really lean and then you're like oh man
I'm just gonna eat cookies and drink
protein shakes and ice cream sandwiches
or whatever else you want to eat it's
cool but if you eat mostly junk you can
do two things even if you set your
calories right but it's tons of junk
mostly junk
your performance is gonna suck uh one of
my best friends and I we were visiting a
friend in California
generation ago and we were I was already
training I was like 220 drug free and
shit and like we're eating a lot of fast
food out there
and I just remember eating like the day
before I had like three of those KFC
famous Bowls the mashed potato bowls
that's so good
and the next day went did High rep
deadlifts and him and I both did a
couple sets and we looked at each other
like are we in altitude or something it
was in Irvine California fucking
altitude and it's just like
between sets I was not sick it's just
like poisoned by junk food there is such
a thing as too much
so you you can't run a high performance
machine on junk food eating mostly
healthy food's a good idea so it's not
going to get great gym performances
and that's bad and then it's also not
great for your health so yes junk food
has cooled heat and moderation on a
muscle gain phase but most of your foods
should still be healthy Whole Foods
Point number eight very related but the
opposite never eating junk you'll have
folks that are like I'm fucking on a
muscle gain phase I'm serious as a
fucking heart attack clean food 24 7.
brother hey respect if you can survive
that grind for the rest of your
bodybuilding career amazing but most
people dare I say almost all people
need a bit of fun in their life need a
bit of fun Foods and so a real good way
to go about that is you eat mostly
healthy food but a few times a week I do
it once or twice a week on a muscle gain
phase you throw in a cheat meal and uh
it's really awesome and it costs you
almost nothing on the downsides and it's
so great psychologically it's so fun
that by the time you get to your fat
loss phase you've had more than enough
cheating and you can really grind
super clean eating out a fat loss phase
because if you don't have some cheat
meals on your muscle gain phase
when the fuck are you gonna have cheat
meals maintenance I guess sure but it's
kind of fun to be able to train hard as
fuck and then eat a cheat meal and
understand that a lot of it's getting uh
in the muscles to help you gain muscle
it's kind of like a there's a really
virtuous cycle there and it feels really
great and clearly not gonna be able to
do it on Fat Loss phase cheating a lot
on active rest or maintenance feels
strange because you're like um I know
I'll have to eat less later to make up
for this and it there's something about
it where if you're ever going to have
cheat meals muscle gain face is the time
to do it and if you're so psychotic
about only ever eating clean
psychologically you're going to pay the
cost of that in most cases sooner rather
than later you're gonna burn out you're
gonna be done with a sport and it's
trippy too because um
I've seen some of my contemporaries uh
who came up at the same time as I did
and a lot of them finished bodybuilding
and they're just done with it because
they went so hardcore into it from day
one they just burned out they're like
I'm tired of eating clean I'm tired of
doing all these workouts that I don't
want to do whereas what I did was I took
a more um relaxed journey and every year
that I was in bodybuilding I had a
little bit more serious about it but
that means I never burned out because it
was I was always having plenty of fun
foods and always training in a way that
was effective but also fun so don't
don't forget that that's a big thing and
at the end of the day this whole thing
we're doing is a fucking hobby it's a
Leisure activity and if it's not fun
maybe sort of ziggly should act or
something like that enjoy some fun Foods
on a muscle gain phase enjoy those Foods
on a bulk it's gonna be something that
reinvigorates you psychologically and
keeps the process fun you'll be able to
do it for long enough to actually get
super jacked
all right
two more
mini cutting too often
unless you're at fifteen percent body
fat or so is a competitive bodybuilder
or 20 to 25 plus percent as a
recreational lifter add 10 or so if
you're female to these numbers
you can easily continue to gain
without needing a mini cut and break up
your momentum
because you'll still gain an
unbelievable amount of muscle and not a
ton of fat yes if you get Ultra Fat it's
all bad and maybe you'll even start
gaining more fat and less muscle but up
until those points are good to go what
we do see with people is they get to 11
body fat and they're like as many cut
time
breaks up their momentum like crazy and
it's just good that you just really kind
of sit in that that of food and training
and momentum for as long as you can when
you're starting to get too fat yes a
mini cut every 8 to 12 weeks is totally
fine but if you're mini cutting every
four to six weeks she whiz you're just
paranoid and the thing is if you were
lean and you like being lean and you got
a little fickolicious on your mass phase
that's nothing a four to six week mini
cut can't fix completely and then you're
fucking ripped again
body Fat's not something that once you
gain a little bit too much of it that's
it it's there forever no way not even
close so it's okay to let that momentum
keep going
until you're convincingly fat enough to
where you need a mini cut and the
paranoia of always mini cutting all the
time is just uh fat phobia and um it's
irrational and will not give you good
long-term results not as good as you
could have had if you let your mass
phases if you really leaned into them
last one last common muscle gain diet
mistake
is continuing is the opposite is
continuing to bulk once your momentum is
all but gone if you're no longer getting
much stronger week to week in the gym if
you're super tired and beat up and
fatigued if every week you notice that
you're notably fatter but no more
notably muscular
stop gaining especially if it's been
months and months and a lot of this
thing so start real quick I'll just
finish the thought stop gaining do an 8
to 12 week normal fat loss phase
maintenance phase at the end to clear
some fatigue or something or maintenance
phase and then eight to twelve week fat
loss phase and then start massing again
doing a fat loss phase won't fuck you up
it's not going to cost you a ton of
muscle or any at all it's just resets
the living fuck out of you and sometimes
that maintenance phase cools off so much
training fatigue that it lets you go for
months afterwards training super fucking
hard if you can no longer train Ultra
hard you if you can no longer
demonstrate that you're getting lots of
muscle and you're starting to gain a lot
of fat
if you're no longer getting stronger in
the gym it's it's too much fatigue be it
diet fatigue or training fatigue or some
combination of both it's time to chill
it's time to maintain it's time to cool
off it's time to mini cut or even do a
real cut and then it's time to come back
up again a lot of the times people get
in trouble with this
is they'll set themselves a dare I say
mildly arbitrary duration goal for
massing or weight gain goal they'll say
less I'm going to amass from 160 to 180.
by the time they reach 175 the holds
it's a giant dumpster fire of
joints hurt I'm not getting stronger I'm
just getting fatter fuck this but they
have this 180 in their head and they go
I gotta get to 180. don't do it
don't fucking do it because you will get
to 180. that's not that hard the average
American weighs like 330 by now or some
shit you ain't even a real sized person
yet in the United States you go to Texas
you're half the size of a real person
gaining weight is not hard gaining
muscle is quite difficult and it has to
occur in a high quality manageable
fatigue environment and if that
environment is no longer with you it's
time to do active rest or maintenance or
whatever to clear the air to Let It Go
Again
the other way people get in trouble is
setting themselves duration goals like a
very common question I get for some
goddamn reason is Dr Mike can I bulk for
a year straight I'm like uh
yes
but it's tough because fatigue will
accumulate much faster than a year you
probably just want to do some
maintaining or some mini cutting at some
point during that time and there are
ways to wiggle around it but um
why why
what is it about a year that that you
are so attached to and if the momentum
is crushing it for a year hey fuck sweet
go for a year and a half but if the
momentum is clearly gone by month eight
you gotta you gotta retune the system
right and there has to be a compelling
reason of why you are massing for as
long as you are and just setting
yourself a goal and going
um it's cool in the sense that like
you're a person of principle he is a man
of focus of principle that fucking John
Wick shit Scott the video guy remember
that shit
of indomitable will of terrible fake
Russian accent by non-native speaker
[Music]
in any case you're all John Wicked out I
get it you fucking well John Wick says
he's gonna get to 180 he's gonna get to
180. hell or high water that's cool but
you can be that kind of person that's
perseverant and really goal-oriented and
doesn't lie to themselves but at the
same time be a bit more of a logician
and understand that like when the system
is no longer in a properly functioning
state
it's not about willpower anymore
nobody's doubting your shit bring it
back around it's like if John Wick is
shooting people and it's working great
keep shooting but if like a tank rolls
up with 900 heavily armed troops John
Wick might egress to like come back
around and go through the sewer tunnels
with homeless
gang or whatever ridiculous movie I love
that shit
um
I love watching John work High because I
don't have to make sense out of anything
trying to make sense that a John Works a
bad idea in any case even John Wick
pulls back uh when the time comes and so
it's one of these situations where yes I
understand you told yourself I'm gonna
bulk for a year I'm gonna bulk till I
get when I went to 180. if it fits a
motivational problem Hey listen that's
between you and God which is to say John
Wick again but um if it's the thing
where you're just like pointlessly like
trying to bash through this barrier and
you don't have to and there's smarter
ways to do the same thing
go with the smarter way and I guess that
really is a the big point of of today's
talk is be smart don't be stupid do all
the good things don't do bad things
enjoy your muscle gain and as usual if I
see you on the street I'll have my
butler say hi to you talk to regular
people anymore shit
see you next time
