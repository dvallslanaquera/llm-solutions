hey folks dr mike kuznetsov here for
renaissance periodization rp plus rpu
and the planet uh
venus yes it's a loving planet with
incredibly high temperatures
whoever assumed that venus had anything
to do with love had clearly never been
to venus but more importantly
they probably never thought about rest
times between sets
which is our hypertrophy advanced
concept and tool
number seven let's get right into it
first topic is why are we interested
about rest times between sets
we're going to talk about the status of
the direct evidence what an actual
research laboratory research found out
about rest times and what's best for
growth
we're going to talk something uh
theoretical but very very important
which is actually critically important
in figuring out why we care about rest
times and why we want
them specific which is what is the goal
of hypertrophy training
see a lot of people lose sight of that
when they think well you need to rest
this much in that much
arrest enough time for what is the
question we're going to answer
that answer is given to us by the four
factor rest times model
developed here at rp that's really good
and we're going to talk about examples
of
applying that model implications for
training and programming recommendations
actually really straightforward stuff
this is i'm super proud of this concept
we developed um and it just makes a lot
of sense and once you get through it
you'll be like holy crap this is this is
awesome
and it really just solves a lot of
problems with rest times so
first question why ask between rest
times or
ask about rest times between sets um
so first is if we found out rest times
don't have to be nearly as long
as we thought you know most of the time
you see people in the gym they do a set
and they like
wait around you've got better shit to do
than wait around at a gym imagine if we
found out that optimal hypertrophy
occurred with five seconds rest between
sets
as opposed to three minutes holy crap
you could have like tons of your life
back like you just have saved tons of
time
right um next question is if we want
optimal gains okay
forget efficiency who cares we just want
the best gains possible
well g you know rest times if some rest
time probably relates to optimal gains
we want to find out what that is
point number three there's lots of
confusion on the topic a lot it has to
be addressed
there's all sorts of people have all
sorts of ideas about rest times that are
unfortunately not super correct
and a lot of those folks are actually
not interested in the sort of thing
because too many people want one blanket
answer
um i get that all the time on instagram
when i post training videos
a lot of people say you know how much do
you rest between sets
the answer as you will see is relatively
complicated for instagram
simple for intellectual life complicated
for instagram
um but a lot of people want that blanket
answer or just two minutes or one minute
and the blanket answers just almost
never work
in anything that's worth doing well
right you ask somebody how you build a
rocket
okay it's not going to be a blanket
answer it really depends on where you're
going and what you want on the rocket
weight limit so on and so forth
so status of the direct evidence so when
we look at laboratory evidence and rest
times
most analyses find no real difference in
growth
but these are between what we can call
not extreme alterations of rest time one
and three minutes two and four minutes
not like five seconds versus five
minutes okay
however uh there's a distinct um
uh feature in the literature that very
short rests have been found to cause
less growth
specifically in um compound moves
not an isolation move so they found that
moves like squats deadlifts bench
presses etc
if you rest very little there's less
growth caused by a total number of sets
but in maybe things like tricep
kickbacks and bicep curls
there's no real difference okay and
uh people have tested out to
three to five minutes of rest and found
that for most people
uh rest that long are not any more
beneficial
okay so so far we can say that rest time
doesn't matter a ton within a normal
range but it does matter
if it gets a little too short but if it
gets really really long it doesn't add
anything to it
so why is there a discrepancy between
compounds and isolations
that idea actually leads to the rest of
our analysis here
so first is what is the goal of
hypertrophy training
sounds like a stupid fucking question
because the answer is to grow muscle
right but hypertrophy training the hope
as we grow muscle the
goal is to stimulate the target muscle
the target muscle not your lungs not
your nervous system not your perception
of how hard it is
the target muscle okay
so how do we stimulate target muscle uh
from two lectures back the best way to
stimulate target muscle
is to take it close to failure or close
to its limits
but take that muscle itself close to its
limits
not be limited by any other factors
right you want to be limited in your set
by the local muscle ability to do more
reps
and if you're limited by anything else
you're probably leaving gains in the
tank
okay so for example if the reason you
stopped doing squats
in your set of 20 you stopped at 15 is
because you ran out of breath
you just like start choked to death you
have to rack the bar is that
true that we're pushing the quads as far
as they go no
because you pushed your lungs as far as
they go is that great for improving your
lungs
actually yes high rep squats are a great
way to get into cardio shape
but that won't get you into the best
hypertrophy shape you can be
because it doesn't push the local
muscles far enough
right so how do we know so basically the
answer is
we have to stimulate the muscle as much
as we can or to a sufficient extent
locally the muscle itself and not be
limited by anything else
how do we know we're not limiting local
performance by any other mechanisms
well we examine a local recovery and
three other sources of systemic recovery
to make sure that we can check the boxes
and say
we've rested long enough so that the
limiting factor for this muscle's
upcoming performance is
the muscle itself and thus the next set
is going to be as
stimulative of hypertrophy as possible
right because our goal is that the
target muscle is as stimulated as
possible
it's the limiting factor and no other
system
how many other systems are there they're
for the system
so the first thing we want to recover in
the four factor rest times model
is the local recovery we'll get to what
that means in just a second but
basically
the local muscle you're stimulating has
to be recovered enough to put in another
good set
right it can't just be you know just
barely recover to do one more rep
okay that's hardly a side that's hardly
much growth okay so local
muscle has to be locally recovered to at
least get another good set we'll define
exactly what that means in a bit
secondly your nervous system has to be
recovered so that it's
giving enough enough drive so that local
muscular recovery is now the limiting
factor again
your cardio respiratory system has to be
recovered enough your lungs have to be
recovered enough in order to push the
muscle to its limits
an easy way to see this and we'll get to
some examples just a second if you're
doing
really really high rep squats and you're
oh you're like out of
the bar i'm a throb right that's
limiting your set is limited by cardio
respiratory you could have done more
squats if you just had better lungs
right but does that ever happen on wrist
curls can you imagine you're doing wrist
curls
on a bench with a dumbbell oh my god no
my forearms are fine but i just can't
breathe like holy shit you need to go to
the hospital right
now you're probably in the middle of a
heart attack right the way you reach
failure to risk kernels you're just like
oh my wrists hurt and i can't do another
rep
and i just drop it and then you go
that was tough someone's like it doesn't
look tough well your cardiovascular
or cardiorespiratory system is not
limiting that which is a really good
thing
right so when you do risk curl you can
be sure you're limited at local faction
at a local factor not by your cardio
respiratory system
point number four is a synergist muscle
recovery
and we'll talk about this in just a bit
but basically muscles that support
the muscle you're trying to target are
they recovered enough to not be limiting
factor for example again in squats
if you're targeting your quads and you
start rounding your lower back because
your lower back is so pumped and so sore
and so tired that you can't maintain
good technique you end up racking the
bar
and someone's like oh man your quads
gave out you're like no my lower back
gave out is that really pushing your
quads as hard as possible
no so before we do our next set we have
to make sure our synergist muscles the
ones that support the main muscle we're
targeting
are recovered enough to no longer be the
limiting factor
all right the four factor rest times
model
opened up everything explained so local
recovery
is asking the question is the muscle
itself ready to do at least another
hard set which by all the other
definitions that we put out
is at least five good repetitions
potentially close to failure
okay and these are the most effective
reps because they recruit all the fire
and motor units so on and so forth
is the muscle itself ready to do at
least another five or so reps okay
if it's still full of lactic acid then
and then the you can only do one more
rep the answer is no so for example
if you did barbell curls and you put the
bar down and
let's say you're a super endurance
athlete and you're neurologically super
primed and there's really no you know
your forms and stuff are super strong
your biceps are pretty weak so
everything's fine except your biceps are
messed up and they still have a ton of
lactic acid in them you're like
my bicep do you immediately reach down
to do another set no because you do like
one and a half reps you'll have to put
it down that's not a set that's a joke
so how long do you have to rest in that
if only your local factor local recovery
is limiting factor
you have to least at least rest at least
enough seconds to let the biceps get in
another set of five reps okay which
might be like
oh 10 seconds it might be 20 it might be
30 shit it might be a minute
but you have to you'll be able to be
like okay all right all right all right
my biceps got another five reps in them
but if you like
still physically have lactic acid
perceptual in your muscles like i can't
even un
i can't even stretch these out you're
not getting five reps no good
okay so the first thing you have to make
sure that you're checked off the list
is the local muscle is recovered enough
to do another good
at least five reps it can be more than
five reps but at least five reps in that
next set okay that's the soonest you can
possibly start
number two nervous system recovery the
way
you can tell is this is a pretty rough
metric but it works pretty well do you
feel like you have another heart set in
you or do you
feel beat down and don downtrodden from
the last one
for example let's say you're doing
overhead barbell presses
right and you just do a set of barbell
presses and then like you know your your
lungs aren't super taxes it sets of six
or something you're breathing fine
no synergist muscles are a problem your
front delts are the target and
they're no longer carrying lactic acid
after like 30 seconds you look at the
bar
you just feel weak the idea of having to
overhead press that you're like there's
no way that's happening
right your nervous system is still not
refreshed enough not recovered enough to
get another good effort
but you all know the feeling if you've
trained more than a couple months of
looking at that bar after about two or
three minutes and be like
yeah that shit's going up let's do it
right when you feel ready
to push your muscle to its limits you're
good to go
if you feel like you can't push hard yet
or pull hard yet because you're just
centrally like at your core like in your
soul still
tired still defeated because every set
should defeat you at least somewhat
it's not good to go yet don't go right
super super straightforward next
is cardiorespiratory recovery occurred
are you still breathing heavy or is your
breathing under control is the easiest
way to do that one right
so if you're ready to do another set of
squats so to speak let's say
you're quads no more lactic acid and
them your nervous system feels fine
you're like alright i can have a bar on
my back i can do some reps
but you're still doing this
how many reps of squats you're gonna get
three and then you're gonna throw up all
over yourself
right even if you don't you might get 10
reps of squats well if your lungs were
truly recovered and your cardio
respiratory system
was performing at maximum ability then
you might have gotten 15 total reps and
actually driven your quads close to
failure
but if you're so cardio respiratory
under recovered
any set you do after that it's just
going to be the limiting factor is going
to be cardio respiratory
which means you're just doing shitty
cardio training at this point
so when your breathing is back to
relatively normal you're good to go
there's a chance that your breathing can
be still pretty high
but that you have enough to really
contract the muscle in really small
muscle mass exercises so if you're
breathing
a little bit heavier on curls like
can you do another set well are your
lungs going to limit you or are you
still going to push your muscles to the
max well if you're really close to local
recovery your nervous system feels good
another five reps of curls might just
get you breathing a little bit heavier
but you're still failing at the muscle
itself because of the muscle not your
cardio respiratory system
that's totally fine like with a cable
curl drop set you're gonna be breathing
pretty heavy at the end
it's just that your breathing can't be
the limiting factor like for example
if your biceps don't have a ton of
lactate in them but you have to stop in
the middle of a set of curls to go
okay more that's a problem because now
you're relaxing the muscles
you're not letting them accumulate the
internal metabolites they need to
generate the tension they need to get
close to failure
you're letting your lungs take a
breather not a really good thing
last one number four synergist muscle
recovery
is any supporting muscle still holding
on to too much lactic acid
or is it too fatigued and it will it be
the limiting factor on the next set
instead of the target muscle it can
absolutely happen
right if you're doing uh you know peck
flies or something like that it has to
be like a slippery
handle for your pec deck machine your
forearms might get pumped
right your packs might be ready to go
but you're like oh hold up hold up hello
hold on my
reforms are still tired right if your
forearms are super tired
they can be the the reason that you
start to bend like this towards the end
then you start to let the implement go
and you're done and someone said how
many reps did you get in the tank for
your packs
my pecs could have done at least another
eight reps so what the hell are you
doing that's not even
eight reps in reserve for your packs
eight rir
doesn't grow hardly any muscle compared
to two or three or four rar
right so you have to make sure that
whatever muscles are synergists and
sometimes they don't exist
if you're doing calf raises there are no
synergists right
or i don't know your gabs or something
right sometimes there are no center just
for for
if you're doing forearms like if you're
doing wrist curls on a bench there are
no synergists it's just your forearm
muscles
but for biceps there are already
synergists right you guys ever do curls
and your biceps are really recovered but
your forearms are still like
super tunnel acting in them don't do
another set of curls yet
because your forearms are going to
become the limiting factor it's going to
rip your biceps off
not a good thing all right so some quick
examples
with sample times barbell squats
for sets of 10 to 15 reps each time
after about
30 seconds and as i say this you'll
probably be like you know what that's
pretty close
after 30 seconds or so your quads no
longer have a lot of lactate in them and
they actually feel like they're pretty
ready to go
right mentally you might be ready after
about two minutes you're like all right
i'm good for another set
but your lower back might take another
three minutes
the sitter just might take another three
minutes to recover there's like you're
ready to go but you've been gaining some
weight in your lower back's like no
we're not starting yet to still have
lactic acid build up
and because you're gaining weight and so
on and so forth your body fat may be
higher doing less cardio
your lungs might only be ready after
four minutes so it takes you four whole
minutes
okay okay breathing breathing's good
i've been ready for everything else
i'm good to go right so then what is the
answer to how much you rest between sets
four minutes or rather when you can
check all of those things they just
checklisted at different times
what about something like machine rows
right
your back muscles might be ready to go
10 seconds after you guys you've
finished a set of machine rows
you get some like pump in your back and
oh it hurts but then like how long do
you have an upper back
lactate accumulation for like a couple
seconds after about 10 seconds
you're like your back is feeling
fundamentally fine
right your grip might take another 10
seconds after it might take 20 seconds
to go because it can be a limiting
factor absolutely
because it's machine rose your lungs may
never have been taxed because you're
you're not propping yourself up you're
on a machine
it's propping you up you might actually
be totally good to go at that point
right so your lungs are automatic
checklist right away
and mentally you might feel ready in
about 30 seconds either machine rows are
not the end of the world
and you know after about 30 seconds all
right yeah
i'm good to go let's go you feel like
you get a my muscle connection again you
feel like you get good
nervous impulse to the muscles
everything's good so then you only rest
for 30 seconds
and every single set you do you rest for
just enough time roughly around 30
seconds
you're going to feel like all of those
are good hard sets
with a local back musculature is what is
limiting you
if that took you only 30 seconds between
sets to achieve
in machine rows it could have taken you
four minutes to achieve
in back squats very very different now
i'm sure you guys see them
not stupidity the ridiculousness of
asking hey how many
how much should i rest between sets it
really depends and
watch how it depends on this last
example calf machine
drop set your calves might be ready
after three seconds of waiting ready for
what you ask to do another productive
set of five to ten reps of a lower
weight
so you get 200 pounds on the calf raise
and then you drop the weight and you go
to 180 or 160.
you literally go one two three
lactate is almost completely gone from
your calves and you're definitely golden
for another five to ten reps especially
if you started the drop set at a set of
20
right you're for sure good for another
five to ten reps what about your lungs
they were never taxed who the hell
breathes heavy on calf raises if you
breathe having calf raises you have
serious issues you need to go see
your medical professional nervous system
was never really taxing me
for the love of god how centrally
difficult are calf raises can you
imagine someone would be like oh
just did calves man i'm wiped out i'm
gonna go to sleep like what
right like you can pump out calves no
problem it's really just the local
limiting factor that's a problem
and what are the synergists on calf
raises none usually in a machine that
just isolates your hips
down to your calves you're good to go
it's not like you're holding yourself
into the machine
there's pretty much no synergist so what
is the rest time there between drop sets
of calves
three seconds three fucking seconds
between sets someone could say
oh my god you're resting way too little
and here's the kicker you post on your
instagram
three seconds rest between sets here are
my results you're my reps
someone could say oh my god three
seconds you're an idiot why didn't you
rest longer and you could be you could
entertain the idea
what would happen if i rested longer
well i did another productive set of
five to ten reps after three seconds
so that's a big check i could do another
set if i rest in let's say 10 seconds
i could do another set of uh 10 to 15
reps let me ask you a question
does a set close to failure 5 to 10 row
less muscle than one of 10 to 15
same amount of growth because number of
heart sets is the number one correlate
for hypertrophy
okay what about if you rested 10 seconds
how would that affect your lungs well it
wouldn't your lungs never got taxed
what about your nervous system never
taxed or rather never
limiting factor never limiting factor
for your nervous system
never limiting factor for your lungs and
there are no synergists
so your retort back to that person who
says why not your rest 10 seconds is
why would i imagine someone said hey
listen
uh you know when you rest and you take
road trips you need to spend at least an
hour at every rest area
what if you have coffee in hand you're
feeling fucking golden
you've peed you've pooped you've grabbed
a snack you walk around and stretched
after 20 minutes you're just like
biting time and someone's like nah now
now you have to
rest another 40 minutes maybe they have
a great idea but you have to ask why
you say why well like well you can you
know you
did you use the bathroom yep did you
grab a coffee
yes do you feel great yep
uh did you stretch your legs sure did if
all of the stuff we need
to rest is accomplished why would we
rest longer now we can if we want
uh you know you're stressed out about
your day you want to scroll on instagram
for longer sure
but you don't need to rest any longer
resting shorter
terrible idea because then you won't
achieve all of these and you will be
limited
by uh you know from from having your
best heart sets
but any longer is totally up to you and
it's not necessary
so what does this imply for training
well
how long do you rest between sets the
answer is when all four factors are
removed
okay when only
factor one is limiting local muscle's
limiting and it doesn't prevent five or
fewer reps from being done
right so basically your approach is set
and you know that what's going to stop
you on this next set is your local
muscular fatigue and you're gonna get at
least
five reps you're recovered as recovered
as you need to be
to get full hypertrophic benefit
this can be very different between
different muscles and different people
your forearms the way i train farms is
i rest no longer than 10 seconds between
every single sign
i never have i almost certainly never
will there's nothing to rest for
after 10 seconds of doing some kind of
forearms i'm like
after 15 i'm like that's just five
seconds down the drain right i
rest a minute and it would increase the
number of reps i got per set
but it's still the same number of hard
sets and we know that increasing reps
doesn't really matter
it's the number of hard drives per set
that really matter right so
forms 10 seconds or something like that
what about quads
can you imagine resting 10 seconds
between sets of quad work sets of high
bar squats
10 seconds 10 seconds for most people on
a set of 10 to 15 in squats is just
enough for them to peel themselves
out of the power rack and fall down on
the floor in bloody vomit
but it's gonna take another three
minutes for you to clean up your blood
and your fountain
put your belt back on not die get under
the bar
walk out reconsider your entire life
plan and do some more squats
i've actually tried drop sets of squats
so stupidest thing in the world
because two drop sets in you're getting
like sets of two with like
225 is like pathetic and you are
entirely limited by your lungs and you
can't even feel your quads because
you're choking death
real dumb right huge difference between
something like forms and quads
what about someone whose aerobic
differences
mean cardio respiratory recovery is
really really different
300 pound person out of shape after
squats is going to take 10 minutes until
their lungs are back in working order
and not limiting factor anymore
what about a 100 pound in shape person i
used to train cross-country runners that
were elite national level when i was a
university
strength coach baffling we didn't do a
set of 10 close to failure in the high
bar squat
they're quick learners really good
technique all the way down had an elite
endurance run or do a set of ten and the
the last five reps with the slow stretch
you were seeing you're like full
grinders it was like
i'm just going up super super slow rack
the bar and he goes like this
that was really hard i was like are you
gonna throw up
are you gonna die and they're like what
i was like
okay well we'll rest another two minutes
and then they just literally just
bumbled around for two minutes and then
we took the rest down to one minute they
got the same number of reps and took the
rest down to 30 seconds they got the
same number of reps
turns out if we let that guy rest for
about 10 seconds he would be good to
just keep doing squats over and over and
over
so a huge discovery you might make if
you're a personal trainer is that your
100 pound housewife that's in reasonably
good shape
might need 15 to 30 seconds between
almost every lift
and that your new guy who weighs 320
pounds and is really out of shape might
need
a long time between reps and there's
between sets and there's no like
one template like if it's two minutes
for everyone both people are getting
screwed in their own special way
someone's not resting long enough
someone's resting too long right um
and just at a mechanistic level if
you're training biceps
with curls right uh then you know
there's only so much
systemic uh problem you're gonna
generate there's only so much nervous
system fatigue you can generate just
training one muscle
but what if you train your biceps lats
rhomboids erectors glutes and traps with
barbell rows
the amount of systemic nervous system
fatigue central fatigue is going to be
pretty fucking high
you know you do a set of barbell curls
ah you put it down like ah
a minute later you're like let's do it
again instead of barbell rows
after a minute you're like get that bar
the hell away from you i will collapse
if i grab that thing
you might need another one or two
minutes to get your shit together
neurologically right
so rest times can technically vary
between one second between sets
if you're doing drop sets sometimes just
one second enough to change the pin
is good to get another five to ten reps
of a lighter weight
or as much as 10 minutes between
something like imagine you were a pro
bodybuilder using sets of 10 with 585
that's six plates in the squat
you don't think that's a minute rest do
you it's not a minute rest
i've seen power lifters doing high
volume training the rest 10
15 minutes between high rep sets why
because at minute eight they're still
lying on the floor their lower back
doesn't work you don't simply just
bounce back from something like that
the real answer is rest as long as you
need to checklist all four items
right that being said most rest times
will be between
30 seconds and two minutes in
hypertrophy training but again most
doesn't describe a whole lot on the
shorter ends of rest
reps will fall with each set right but
if the reps are over five percent that
probably means roughly the same
hypertrophy
and you're good to go people always
concerned about rep fall off like well
you started sets of 15 and now you're
doing sets of 11. why because you get
tired
like but isn't that bad no unless your
goal is to arbitrarily hit sets of 15
and you should be training resting 10
sec 10 minutes between every set and
just pissing away your entire life at
the gym
for literally nothing other than being
able to tell people you've done a bunch
of sets of 15
right no added hypertrophy benefit there
and that's very very clear
so how do you put this into programming
best way is to auto regulate race
rest times as the basis of every program
i don't ever
have a stopwatch for my rest okay what i
do
is i show up i do a set i think of all
four checklists in my head and when i
can meet all four i do another set
right sometimes when i feel extra shitty
i take a little bit more time
right what this does is
it allows for local mrv detection
because if you rest
just long enough for your local muscle
to be the limiting factor
the week after week after week you can
gauge performance of the local
musculature super well
and when you no longer perform you know
you've hit a local mrv
right really really cool however
if you reach into something like it
takes you double the time to recover
centrally
especially from a nervous system
perspective right
uh then and you have to do that to keep
the reps from falling so for example
last week you rested a minute you got
sets of 10 on average this week you're
like there's no way i'm getting set to
10 if i rest a minute i need a minute
30. i need two minutes because i'm just
like
my soul is drained that probably means
you're
close to over your systemic mrv that
means your whole system your nervous
system
is probably a little bit over trained
can't adequately recover you to perform
and it probably means you need a deload
or a light session or something like
that to back off
reduce systemic fatigue and keep going
productive right
can you time your rest for consistency
sure
uh just make sure you're not resting too
little resting too long is okay
because there's no limiting factors each
set is still productively hard
you might just not be as efficient um
resting too little
literally chops right into productivity
if you say you're gonna rest only 30
seconds between bicep curls but your
forms are the limiting factor after sets
two three four and five
you're not really training your biceps
hard anymore you're training your
forearms hard
you're doing bicep curls using the wrong
exercise and you're gonna be
disappointed with your results
i would stay away from timing rest but
if you're gonna give yourself a little
bit of extra time
and stay consistent like that folks
thank you so much for tuning in
next time we meet up we're gonna be
chatting about
estimating the volume landmarks in your
training
