it's not uncommon for individuals to
believe the barbell hybar back squat
significantly stimulates and develops
the hamstring muscles
however
the current data suggests this is not
true
kubo and colleagues either have subjects
trained deep squats to 140 degrees of
knee flexion or half squats to 90
degrees of knee flexion twice per week
for 10 weeks
neither group experienced significant
increases in hamstrings volume
comparably
bloomquist and colleagues had subjects
trained parallel squats to 120 degrees
of knee flexion or partial squats to 60
degrees of knee flexion three times per
week for 12 weeks
hamstring's cross-sectional area across
a couple of regions was minimally
impacted by training
