welcome to the first video in this
series
i'll be doing one weekly video on my
training during prep
now i'm still getting to grips with
editing software
recording in the gym and that sort of
thing so bear with me
things are going to improve as far as
quality goes as they go as far as topics
go
i'm still trying to figure out what to
do i could do a q a
voice over sort of thing describe how
the week went as far as prep goes or
give recommendations for technique
on the exercises i'm doing for now i'll
do a mix of those
until i figure out a format that both
you and i like
for now though if you have any questions
just feel free to
post them in the comments message me and
if they're interesting
and i think people benefit i'll discuss
them in a video
the show i'll be competing in is the uk
wmbf
supernaturals the link is going to be in
the description
it's taking place in birmingham in the
uk
in late october as such i'm currently 22
weeks out for my first ever
bodybuilding competition my body weight
is currently hovering around
99 kilograms or 218 pounds
i've been lifting for six years at this
point and spent most of the time in
southwest
not all that time was spent with the aim
of maximizing muscle growth
i spent some time powerlifting i spent
some time bodybuilding
i even spent some time weightlifting but
recently
my main focus has been on bodybuilding i
think
one of the biggest mistakes beginners
bodybuilding make
myself included of course is
underestimating
their body fat in the off season now i'm
trying not to make that mistake myself
but since it's my first time competing
and getting it anywhere near that lean
it's hard to predict what my stage
weight will be i suspect it will be
around
90 kilograms or 200 pounds but it could
be as low as 85 kilograms or as high as
92 kilograms
for reference i'm 62 or 188 centimeters
and 21 years old the plan is for
12 to 15 of the next 22 weeks to be
spent in a deficit losing that
and for the remaining weeks to be spent
at maintenance
or in a slight surplus depending on how
how much more fat i think i've got to
lose
i've competed in power of thing once
before but didn't do super well
you can see the post for that on my
instagram at wolf coach
wolff wolf that's my last name and coach
how you would spell coach there's an
underscore at the end
because instagram sucks um but yeah
nowadays i mostly prefer bodybuilding
training
so that's what i've been sticking to for
a while i guess i may as well give some
background on what i do outside of the
gym too
i am a phd student at solent university
in southampton in the uk
alongside that i work part-time as a
self-employed online coach
between you and me though i'll be
starting a coaching internship with dr
mike israel
of renaissance periodization in june so
in
around a week now um now
if you happened on this vlog randomly do
follow me at wolfcoach on instagram
that's where i'm most active and so if
you want to follow me that's
the fast pace to follow me and then if
you want to have more in-depth content
i think youtube might be good to do my
intention for now
is for youtube to be a more in-depth
medium where i can talk about things
more length
than instagram allows for or favors
so yeah i think that about wraps up the
background information
that i want to get through let's get to
the training so for the rest of this
video i'll just sort of walk you through
a technique of some exercises
now you can see me doing some neutral
grip cable rows here
you can do cable rows and machine rows i
think one of two ways
either you allow your spine to flex
on the eccentric and you extend it
purposely
on the concentric to work your spinal
extensors or spinal erectors
through a full range of motion um
which then makes these rows a pretty
exercise for spinal extensor growth
or you can do them the way i'm doing now
which is
mostly allowing just your upper back to
move and your elbows which makes them
mostly an upper back sort of lower trap
mid trap rhomboid
and there is major exercise so then i
moved on some baseballs
uh you can see me doing them one hand at
a time this isn't
how you're probably used to seeing them
being done this is because of two
reasons the first one you get more range
of motion this way
for regular face pull using cables
typically you get a lot less range of
motion
the second reason is my rear delts are
fairly strong
and so for a lot of cable stacks there
just isn't enough weight for me to do
seven rep ranges on and so doing them
one hand at a time allows me to get
enough weight
to train my dots then i moved on to some
cable ladder raises now i think these
have several benefits
for a hypertrophy program the first one
is
you can get tension at points you
usually wouldn't
using dumbbell lateral raises so using
dumbbell lower raises
there's meaningful sections of the
exercise that don't have much tension
so for example at the very top or the
very bottom there's
little to no tension and so
using cables allows you to circumvent
that issue somewhat and then the second
reason is
you can get a deeper stretch on your
lateral belts than you would be
with dumbbells so you can see me my arm
actually goes
sort of past what it would during a
dumbbell lower raise
while still being under retention
the same kind of reasoning applies for
basin curls i suppose
typically training a muscle group when
it's more lengthened or more stretched
tends to produce more muscle growth than
training it when it's more shortened
like in a peak contraction like in a
preacher core for example and so in this
exercise
by having your shoulder hyper extended
i.e your arms behind you
you're lengthening the bicep more
because the biceps also inserts at the
shoulder
and so because it's more lengthened that
likely makes this a better exercise for
muscle growth than for example a
preacher curl
um and yeah that same principle applies
to
probably all body parts um
so yeah then i moved on to some shrugs
there's nothing
particularly exciting about these i
think one mistake a lot of people make
is
thinking they should use more weight
than they
really should um so i used to do cheat
shrugs with four plates on each side
uh it mostly just got me a lot of
fatigue but not much more stimulus for
my traps
so yeah then my next session i started
off with some hybrid squats
my stance is narrower than most people
that's just what i find most comfortable
and what i can get a lot of range of
motion for my quads
with and yeah
you can also see the tempo is fairly
controlled and i pause at the bottom
on each wrap the reason for that
is mostly the same one i described a
second ago
where treating a muscle group at longer
lengths tends to produce more growth
and so pausing at the bottom and
spending more time per rep
in a more lengthened position and more
effort there and more tension there
might make it a bit better for muscle
growth um
so yeah just something to consider i
think it makes sense for exercises like
squats
split squats benching
lat pull downs where you do have a lot
of tension at the top
but it probably doesn't make much sense
for exercises like done by lateral
raises
where a you don't get a meaningful
stretch on the lateral delts in the
first place and b
there's not much much tension there but
exercises like split squats for example
like
you can see me doing now there is a lot
of tension at the bottom
and the glutes are pretty stretched out
and so i think it makes sense
i used a bench and a step to make sure i
got for range of motion
um i can go pretty deep because i'm
fairly flexible
but you might not be able to go quite as
deep
um but yeah then i moved on to some
light extensions
uh leg extensions can be useful in a
hepatity program
they definitely shouldn't be the main
exercise for the quads
but the way in which they're useful the
ways i suppose are twofold
the first one is it allows you to train
your quads with
little spinal extensor fatigue so most
other exercises like hack squats
hybrid squats um they
involve your core and so use it training
your quads
using those exercises tends to fatigue
those areas as well but then like
essentials don't
and so if you already have a lot of
fatigue in your program from squats
deadlift etc
for your erectors and core then adding
in light essentially might be good
the second reason is most quad exercises
don't really put much tension on your
quads
near the lockout position whereas light
sensors do
and so if you want to maximize overall
quad growth it might make sense to have
some sets of leg extensions in
every now and again then i moved on some
seated light curls
the same reasoning applies hair is for
basin curls where training a muscle
group at longer lengths
tends to produce more growth and i
seated like curls because the hamstrings
inserted the hip
put your hamstrings into more of a
lengthen position than lying like curls
and so this was actually studied a few
months ago in a study
where they compared seated like curls to
lying like curls
and essentially see the leg curls led to
more growth
for the heads of the hamstrings that
insert the hip
and the reasoning for why that might
have happened
was because the hamstrings were more
lengthened
um so yeah then moving on next session
started off with some machine benching
i think machine benching can be very
useful especially if you have a
machine like this one which gives you
both a good stretch to the bottom as
deep as you can go essentially
and then also it converges which means
you get a fairly good
peak contraction so to speak or a long
range motion for your chest
which you can't really get from standard
benching from free weights so
for example you might not be able to get
um much of a peak contraction with free
weights
because at some point which stops and
also with free weights oftentimes
you your rep stops before you get a full
stretch on your chest because the bar
hits your chest so yeah i think machine
mentioning can be very useful for chest
growth specifically
then i had some overhead pressing as you
saw seated and then
some push downs and then some calf
raises i think
single leg calf raises are quite useful
because
they don't require much equipment they
don't require
much warm-up time and if they don't
fatigue you they don't fatigue your core
the same way doing heavy calf raises
with both legs with a barbell on your
back for example would um
and so i think they're a pretty good
option as far as heavy training for your
calves go
i think using single leg calf raises for
heavy walk and
machine walk or
two-legged calf raises for higher rep
work can work pretty well
occasionally i'll hold on to some
weights to make it a bit harder
if i'm trying to get lower reps or if
it's too easy but you can also just use
bodyweight and
it should get you in a decent rep range
the next session i started off with some
overhand lat pull-downs again you can
see me pause each rep at the top
just making sure that i spend some time
in that lengthen position
um touching my chest at the bottom
trying not to flex my spine or sort of
crunch down to finish the wrap
because that's one way in which a lot of
people cheat their pull downs
um then i moved on to some machine rows
neutral grip this time i like machine
and cable rows for higher error ranges
because they're not as systemically
fatiguing as
free weight rows so for example if i
were to try doing
20 to 30 reps on dumbbell rows or
barbell rows
i would often find that my lungs
or my supporting muscle groups like my
legs or
my lower back would give out before my
upper back did
and because i'm doing these exercises
mostly for upper back growth
um it doesn't make sense to use them for
higher up ranges
whereas with machine rows or cable rows
you can use them for higher up ranges
and not be constrained by your lungs or
supporting muscle groups
and so i think that's where they mostly
shine for lower rep ranges i tend to
stick to
pull up variations pull down variations
and
free weight row variations um
ideally you find a machine like this one
which loads the length in position
pretty heavily
like when it's a full stretch it's quite
hard and heavy
but then as you row it becomes easier
then i moved on to some upright rows um
a lot of people are gonna have questions
about this i suspect
um a lot of people demonize this
exercise
for shoulder health fundamentally
if you get pain doing it and you change
your technique around it doesn't help
yeah you should probably avoid it um
most people can do some form of upright
rowing
whether that's dumbbells barbell cables
or what have you
in my case i don't really like cables it
feels a bit rough on my shoulders but
then dumbbells easy bar
feel fine um so stick to what you can do
pain-free
and go as high as you can pain-free
um then i moved on to some incline
dumbbell hammer curls same reasoning
applies hair is for
basin curls where because the shoulder's
a bit hyper extended
your biceps get more lengthened which is
likely better for muscle growth
um i think doing most of your isolation
bicep work
in that more lengthened position using
either incline curls or basin curls
is a pretty good idea doing some
preach curls for example is fine but i
think most of you will actually come
from
more length and exercises then i did
some
dumbbell wrist curls i prefer these to
standing wrist curls for two reasons
a being seated or at least kneeling
tends to be a bit less fatiguing in my
experience
and b you get much more of a stretch on
your
wrist flexor of reflexes yeah wrist
flexors in this exercise than you would
standing up and more tension so i think
this is a better exercise
most of the time for muscle growth um
but yeah that about wraps it up for this
