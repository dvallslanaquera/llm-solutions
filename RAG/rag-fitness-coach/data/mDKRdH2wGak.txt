hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
purisation with of course jared feather
my bodyguard and well android i designed
for i would say my protection but it's
really destruction of the earth we all
know that and we are here with uh brett
contreras phd
right
dr brett contreras
i mean like
i know but also a doctor i've always
hated when doctors are like whoa whoa
whoa that's doctor brad
i think i earned it i think i think
you've earned it
so we are here to talk about a super fun
topic just kidding it's a super nerdy
topic it may be fun if you have no
friends like the three of us well jared
and i don't have any friends no i don't
have any friends jared has plenty of
friends jared name a friend quick you so
you have a friend too that's so nice
jared's technically actually my son you
guys already knew that
brett
you have friends
but you also have
a
something to talk about something that's
been on your mind
and
i can intro it or you can intrude what
is it here that we're here to discuss
will you just start rapping at us brett
all right
since i've noticed this growing trend in
the industry
where you've got all these guys bashing
exercises
exercises that we like
so now it's gotten to the point where
you're you do a
lat prayer and you get attacked for it
and i just doesn't work a lot it doesn't
work the last and i do a seated hip
abduction and i get all these people oh
my god that does that only works the
piriformis lmfao
so
true academic critique true academic
yeah so since it's kind of become this
wild wild west out there
um
and and it's annoying when you make a
post and you have
you know
one tenth of the comments being like
laugh my ass off this doesn't even work
that muscle and you're like how could it
not work that i feel it working the
muscle
but they're learning from certain
charlatans that don't they're they call
themselves biomechanics but they're not
biomechanics it's this the age of the
self-proclaimed
biomechanist that never actually studied
biomechanics functional anatomists
they didn't take courses for this so
they're
they have good ideas but they're
they're
unpolished they're sure lacking
education
they could be very good scientists but
they don't have the requisite education
so i created a
kind of like an exercise efficiency
guide how should we go about figuring
out if exercises are
efficient how what what criteria should
we go should we go on right or basically
another way to put it is
if there is a claim that or hypothesis
that hey i think this exercise works
this muscle
to what degree can you be certain about
that and how do you increase the degree
to which you're certain
and so you have laid out an idea about
how you would go in sort of different
lines of evidence and they kind of
converge and if they converge on an
exercise that says from all these lines
of evidence it's probably that this
exercise works this muscle then of
course there's no certainty in science
but you could say hey this is a pretty
good bet whereas if you do that analysis
that you're going to talk to us about
just a sec and it comes out like maybe
then you know maybe but maybe not and
then if you do that analysis and it's
like probably not then i would just
probably pick a different exercise to
target the muscle
so what uh what's on your mind what are
you thinking are the the ways the tools
by by which we can the tools we can use
to figure out does this exercise work
this muscle okay so
they're kind of three categories of
clues the first category would be common
sense clues those are things that you
can just
you go by feel and things like they're
just common sense they don't require any
tools these are the most common that we
go by bros
if we're talking to each other after
workout i'm not a bro don't point i mean
i'm a scientist
damn it we're bros i'm definitely
bruised i always think it's funny if
people heard us talk
like without the camera on yeah jerry be
like dude this gave me a sick pump
that's how we talk about we don't like
i experience extreme self swelling
extreme self swelling they're like which
cells are you okay
oh i love it
um
but yeah you you'd be like dude you
should try this
pendulum squat and i got my quads and
we'd be like
and it didn't hurt my knees you know or
like
my knees feel really good with it we
we're bros
that's what we have that common
terminology so these are the thing bro
the things bros talk about
the problem with common sense clues is
that you don't have numerical data
it's nice to have numbers
i do a preacher curl you do a
concentration curl and you do a dumbbell
incline curl
which is best how would we ever know
that we would know that if we had a
longitudinal study that's the third
category of clue
uh well so the second category is
numerical clues this is how you provide
numbers
to the to the you bring numbers to the
table the problem with these is they're
rare because they require biomechanical
tools these are the things sports
scientists use
and then the third category yeah
and then the third category would be
longitudinal clues this is the most
powerful evidence the problem is when
will there ever be a study looking at
the dumbbell incline curl versus the
concentration curl versus the preacher
curl that will probably never happen
in our in our lifetime the government
needs to really seriously be prioritized
 cancer screenings gone
genomics research gone military defense
cut in half at least
obesity whatever people need biceps
so that's the problem that mike just
alluded to is that
um that we're never gonna have the
funding
we will never we will all
sports science will always have way more
uh mechanistic studies more more acute
studies than longitudinal studies what i
mean is
if you're trying to be
prolific as a researcher you want to
publish
okay
you can do like one training study a
semester and it's a pain in the butt
you know if
if you do it
a 12 12 week long training study that
takes the whole semester normally you
use your students
you got to get right to it you got to
introduce
you know like familiarize them with it
do the study analyze the data write it
up that's a whole semester you can do
one of those per you know usually you
know if you're a professor and they're
very involved if you've ever done a
training study you get dropouts you get
it's so frustrating
these are
always going to be
so limited you know the actual training
studies
um and so
in a perfect world we would have
hundreds of studies on every exercise
i'm like we still flexing your calves
maybe
i'm sitting next to jared i kind of get
some calf energy i start feeling my
we would have 100 studies on every
exercise and we'll look at every
variation of that exercise and we have
to replicate the studies too they'd be
replicated they'd have different
populations you'd have newbies advanced
you'd have tall people short people
you'd have old people young people male
versus female you'd have
all different types of
studies people look who grew up without
male role models
i'd be in that one
um
different combinations of volumes
frequencies and you know loads of effort
and things like that but we don't we
will never really have that and
ideally you'd have so many studies that
you'd have review papers written that
would just hey i want to know about the
meta-analysis of the biceps
you just want to know like yeah
what's you know
what's the best way to work the biceps
you read a review paper here's the
here's the three thousand studies just
summarized into one nice neat paper that
organizes and graphically illustrates it
all that doesn't exist that will not
exist in our field so
we have to go so we have to go down the
chain since we don't have the
longitudinal research we don't have the
longitudinal clues that tell us
like if there were 20 studies showing
look
the uh concentration curl beats out the
dumbbell and incline curl and the
and the preacher curl mine wins
we would do mostly that if they were
like
you know all the training studies ever
can and there were like 50 of them and
they all pointed to that then they would
be
and then we would help us develop the
mechanisms too we'd be like why does the
concentration curl work better than the
dumbbell and clank chrome we could start
honing out but we don't have that we
will never have that
the funding will never be there even 200
years from now it'll be the same way and
then we won't even need sports science
research because we'll just take pills
to look however well i want to be a
robot by then yeah
just be robots
so let's go through the common sense
clues these are the ones people use the
most number one is feeling sensation
bodybuilders have talked about this
forever you know your body your body is
different than his body and my body
so why would you not listen to that
we're smart people we can tell what
works
in some you're smart jared and i
we're people barely
so we we can tell when you do a you know
triceps exercise you can tell i feel
this working more than this exercise
it's maybe it suits my body better or
you know what i mean but you can feel
we're all
you know you know your body well if you
pay attention to it
some circles are
saying you shouldn't pay attention to
feel that's really strange isn't it yeah
i can understand where they're coming
from they're saying look field can lead
you the wrong way or feel is everything
maybe that's not true but to completely
wash it away as nothing is kind of like
well if you say like eyewitness accounts
are not super powerful evidence that's
true what about 1 000 eyewitness exactly
the same event like well it starts to be
pretty convincing so i think like maybe
those people at the extremes are saying
people abuse the feel and then just like
maybe they're making it up in their
heads maybe they're very unique but to
say that it doesn't matter at all which
i've heard people say uh that's kind of
strange like everyone's doing an
exercise that works you so well at that
particular time you're like i feel like
i'm gonna tear my freaking muscles oh
yeah well like if you do skull crushers
properly and nice and deep you feel your
triceps pulling apart you're like if
someone's like that doesn't work triceps
you're like okay
on hex squats one time i was doing i'm
like
i think i'm going to stop now
if i go to true failure i think i'll be
sorry triple
pop off you
yeah something bad might happen so
yeah so
the feel and the sensation basically
that's important is it all that no every
one of these are a piece of the puzzle
that's what's important
i'm going to show throw 20 puzzle pieces
at you they're all important
you're going to have way more of these
puzzle pieces from this category though
so the feel and sensation we can all do
that we can all do an exercise and pay
attention
similar to feeling sensation is the burn
you know if you're doing exercise and
you feel the burn
chances are it works that muscle well
and then the next category is similar to
the pump not the category the next
criteria is the problem of that category
yeah if you do an exercise and get a
pump for that muscle it how could it not
work that muscle well well you know it's
interesting because they used to say i
remember when i was going to school in
1896 go ahead and make fun of my age
it's okay it's okay what's okay but i'm
that you're a thousand i'm almost a
grandfather yeah
so
literally in the early 2000s i remember
reading like position stance published
by reputable authorities that would say
that well because you know arnold was
saying back in the 70s
the bump is everything i it's a literal
quote by the way and um they were saying
well actually the pump is just increased
blood flow and doesn't have any
relationship to muscle growth and then
of course five years later we find out
that the pump has been directly
connected multiple times to not only
evidential growth but actually
mechanistic growth through self-swelling
so it kind of looks bad to those people
that said well feelings don't matter
like well now we found out there's
actual mechanisms for that so so the
pump in my opinion very important okay
dom's the next criteria's dom's
if you do a bunch of sets you want to
know what what area muscle works
do 10 sets
and then the next day or two days later
pay attention to where you're sore
you know that's that's another common
sense clue you don't need any you don't
need any instruments for that you just
pay attention to where you're sore
all right then you have
tension there's kind of two types of
tension one is visual if you're if you
train a lean person you can see what
muscles are being worked you know what i
mean
you go like this where the fly and the
pecs do the oldest feathers
the packs aren't working for sure right
okay yeah uh or like someone doing face
pulls and they're shredded you see their
upper back muscles just
you know you can see all the details
so that kind of gives you a good
indication or even if they're wearing
leggings you can see people's glue if
they're lean you can see their glutes
are quite through the leggings but
there's also tension by palpation and
this is if you're you know uh you can
palpate yourself or you can palpate your
training partners things like that you
feel
their glutes when they're doing a 45
degree hyper they get rock hard okay the
floor and they can feel them too you can
just double confirm
if you can feel it getting rock solid
that's generating tension okay
now a couple more the next one is fiber
directions and and and joint actions
like
we know that the is that all of
biomechanics
i'm just kidding that's that's what a
lot of people think biomechanics that's
how some people just go by this one
piece yeah they just go by functional
anatomy exactly and join they know that
you know we know that um you know the
biceps flexes the elbow and so you know
but sometimes it's more complicated than
that sometimes there's not a muscle well
suited for a particular joint action
like
spinal rotation
hip internal rotation
what muscles
has a perfect
uh line of force for that you know
you don't always have this perfect
muscle that's perfectly so your body has
to kind of cobble together a motor
program a bunch of different muscles you
know like in this in the in the instance
of
spinal rotation you
no muscle gets really high
emg in terms of mvic in terms of maximum
capacity
you don't have super high activations of
the core muscles but it creates more
compressive force than trunk flexion
trunk extension trunk lateral bending
trunk rotation creates the highest
compressive forces because you
there's no
perfectly rotary like right that spirals
around and you're contracting it just
so you use a lot of the muscles you use
obliques and
multifide and you know erectors the
rotators are in the spine but they're
teeny tiny but if you get jack rotators
it doesn't matter because no one's ever
going to see them it's just kind of like
a huge robbery you know
i actually have a claim i have the
world's most jacked rotators but you
can't see them so
you have to trust me i trust you um so
so
functional anatomy is very important
just like all these are important it's
very important but a lot of times people
rely on
drawings man-made drawings of muscles
whereas
ideally you'd have like cadavers but
even cadavers are dehydrated
you go to a lab that doesn't look like
something like really it looks really
sad stringy flattened out dehydrated
muscles
and also you look at a a muscle when
it's flexed you know for example you go
look at the glute max when people are
contracting them they're
mostly horizontal they're not at this 45
degree angle that people say
you know well combination angles
change slightly when you're using the
muscle and the angle
of the muscle to the joints and bones
can change significantly as the bones
and joints move yeah
so there's functional enemy and joint
action that's important but it's one
piece of the puzzle okay and then
finally we've got
physiques of lifters that prioritize the
lift and this is
i always use the example of we used to
not have
up until several years back
i wasn't aware of a single study that
looked at glute hypertrophy for
uh squats yeah um there was like an
elderly study looking at blood flow
restriction and right and there was like
study on leg press study on another but
not an actual hypertrophy study so
the the like
rigorous scientists would be like we
have no evidence that squats work the
glutes
whereas you'd be like look at olympic
weight lifters they're squatting
now you could say it's not the squats
it's the clean and jerks and the
snatches but still squatting uh yeah
just strange credulity real quick
but it's the hip extension part that the
squat also does that grows the glute
you know if you look at
olympic weight loss tend to have jacked
quads for sure and nice glutes you can
probably conclude it's a pretty good
gluten and quad exercise
because they're doing it three times a
week exactly you know
um
okay so that's the common sense clues
these are the most common clues right
these are what we use most often these
are the what you're going to hear
lifters talking about yeah now the next
category you need
i'm going to reel through like go
through this quickly but because you
need
i might be able to use emg because i
bought my own or like if i bought my own
force plate i have a similar electrical
device that i put on one part of my body
but it doesn't measure anything okay
but please continue
it stimulates yes that does it doesn't
annihilate yes it's ruining my personal
life
it doesn't sometimes it annihilates i
can't turn the knob up too much
sometimes you need an eyeliner i'm done
i swear to god
so these are okay so the most the most
popular one in sports science is emg for
sure now you have
wire and surface emg wire is more
accurate but it's invasive you have to
kind of put a little needle through your
you have to fish it into the muscle
so surfaces people sign up for that
yeah me either like what's the study
design like well we're going to be
putting a little wire in your muscle
like yeah sweet signing up do this 50
bucks
i did it just to see of course i wanted
to see what you would pass out oh yeah
especially when i contracted oh hell no
i don't want anything
so this is what
i told you you know you guys you said
you recently recently sent me this
uh video
and published journalist video i sent
you lots of videos
um of andrew oh i see yeah this is
recent critique of emg yeah
and i i told you i wanted to tell you
what andrew said because andrew is my
good friend he used to be my intern and
i told him at that time
you're you look up to me right now
because you're 20
21 20.
in like three years you'll be so much
smarter than me you know that you can
tell i was a teacher for six years you
know what students are so far above you
and now he's like the smartest guy in
our field and
but that doesn't mean i don't disagree
with him but i defer to him because he
is way smarter i said okay you just
wrote this whole critique of emg here's
this list i sent him this tell me what
doesn't have flaws
which one of these don't have flaws i
love emg i know it's flaws yeah yeah but
i love you know i have a study looked at
single joint movements this was by
god way back in that i think it was
deluca
and it it graphed tension like actual
muscle force versus emg
it's pretty linear i mean it's not exact
but i sure as hell take that over
over nothing so guru's opinion for sure
and also i think andrew's main point
there is the article is actually
designed for people that are in the uh
formal scientists publishing for them to
not use emg as a rigorous one-to-one
proxy yeah that was it but uh if you're
using emg as part of the puzzle piece
it's totally fine especially you you
want to look for like
some uh you know kind of antithetical
results where like
an exercise people claim what works
really well but then the emg just
doesn't show at all or the emg shows
something you weren't expecting that's
very curious and it would require you to
look at it for example it's not a
standalone thing for example
uh when i looked at chin-ups
abs through the roof
i was like okay something's wrong i
redid it then i started
palpating people's abs when they do chin
ups holy crap it's out that happens you
could watch people crunch too to get
them they crunch up yeah they like you
like opposed to your problem the biggest
point was that it's like potentiating
effects kind of like calcium release
that has to happen before you can
experience hypertrophy sure so it might
be measuring that which is still it's a
potentiating factor in what happens
directly
it's not directly not even direct
one of his main points and it's so funny
because
here's andrew here's andrew for you one
of his main points is that um
they have emg has length length related
changes where they actually stimulate
the nerve at the same intensity
throughout the range of motion they one
elicited
twice the emg output when you're getting
the same input
due to the length and so there's length
related changes
and so i said okay andrew rather than
just bashing it why is it always you
guys bashing it why don't you figure out
a correction factor
find a correction factor then that
smooths it out and then it's accurate
and he's like that's what
he's like russian accent
that's what i was going to do from
initially for my phd until i changed
professors of course
then he changed like pain
pain and physics the physics of pain
that's what he's doing i have like a
more practical pain lab in my
basement
i was going to say dungeon i don't know
why i'd say that
so
anyway so emg very popular
i think the pendulum swung because i
think i started and i was part of that i
started coming out with emg stuff left
and right brad schoenfeld and i
published so much stuff and then
everyone was like emg shows this
and we knew that it doesn't mean exactly
mean hypertrophy but then i think the
industry kind of goes woo it goes swings
but it should be here but it swings the
other way the pendulum swings back it
should be in the middle and no
now it's kind of saying people saying
emg means nothing right like i wouldn't
really go saying that like you can do a
curl you can just grab a 10 pound
dumbbell then a 20 pound then a third
and you look at the waveforms and
they're like exactly
how you'd predict
it's a very nice piece of equipment
anyway okay so there's emg there's also
things that i've never used there's tmg
mmg and smg which
tension myography mechanomiography and
sonomyography i've never used them
they're they're but i just wanted to
mention those
now we have functional mri now
some of these are used like mri is used
in longitudinal research to look at
actual muscle growth but when you use
functional mri it measures fluid shifts
so if you do it right after an exercise
then it looks at like metabolic stress
if you do it a couple days after
exercise it looks with muscle damage
it's basically how much fluid is
retained
that's an expensive study that's been
sure that's been correlated with
hypertrophy though um
in the triceps i believe so but
again how many of us have mris are like
two million or something like that i
have one hot you have one i have a few
models
so that operate my mri machines the
models are in charge
okay then we have ultrasound and that
you can use ultrasound also to measure
longitudinal growth throughout a
training study that looks at one
dimension muscle thickness
however you can look at it right after
an exercise to see how much cell
swelling did you get
did the muscles swell 20 you know
um
now you can also these are more
complicated things right
you can take a biopsy and look at the
ecm like the extracellular matrix and z
line disturbances that's a measure of
muscle damage that's what that's called
histology right like a tissue analysis
tissue analysis yeah you can uh you can
look at lactate um and other metabolites
and also glycogen depletion those would
kind of estimate metabolic stress all
right you can look at creatine kinase
and myoglobin levels those look at
muscle damage the problem is like with
the lactate and and creatine kinase so
cool you do
10 sets of squats
well remember that iowa strength coach
that
put his guys through
this was like
2013 or something he put his guy he they
did 10 sets of 10
squats with body weight load yeah
superstarted with 10 sets of sled pushes
and like five of them got 13 of the
players i think got rhabdo
and i looked at that study so i was just
coaching these boys up man i tell you
what you haven't played no football
before sorry i flipped into strength
he's actually the highest paid strength
coach he's actually really good but he
missed it he got a little carried away
here
they weren't adapted to it if you adapt
to if you start off with three sets of
that and then five and then but anyway
could do the repeated battle effect he
should have known he you know we've all
done
coaches i've had people do
some of my biggest mistakes they're
taunting me like i'm just used to
training much harder than this brat and
i'm like okay all right i'll put you you
know and i should have listened to
myself i'll put you in the hospital guys
so um
so anyway
but the problem with that is that okay
so you have high lactate levels after an
exercise
well
we don't know did that is that coming
from one muscle or just all the muscles
is just good at working your whole body
or one particular muscle same with
real quick and that's that i remember
doing up writing a blog post about that
study back in the day
normal creatine kind levels that i
believe are 200 to 400 whatever i don't
know if it's ius or what but
i use i'm just kidding
um
with with people who exercise it might
be a thousand
this one player's levels were like 386
000.
yeah it's like a dragon ball z power
level except in reverse
so yeah that's people can get rhabdo and
it's very dangerous because you get so
much muscle damage that protein
breakdown the the kidneys have to filter
it it's bad
okay
moving on you can look at hormones
testosterone free test cortisol and
that's systemic fact systemic hgh igf-1
mechanical growth factor
the thing is there's this hormone
hypothesis we used to think that was
really important
you know in the days of like bill
cramer's research and all this stuff
everyone thought that that was
you train hey this squats and doubles
jack your testosterone levels up the
most and that's how growth is made it's
real bad diet stuff like growth hormone
in the morning oh that's right that's
right that's right yeah yeah don't train
at this time don't eat this right they
used to say don't eat after a training
because your growth hormone wells will
go down
but like that's also designed to
liberate fuel so of course it would go
down yeah we used to do things
that's kind of like we we were guru in
people back then back in the day we were
and i remember my first gym i had a
sheet that i'd give everyone it was like
want your arms to grow squat and
deadlift this releases i used to say
 like that all the time yeah
so
that's not all that i think it matters
just not as much as people think and
then
rom range of motion and strain like you
can look at the you can look at the how
much the muscle actually stretches you
know what percentage
you can uh look at moment arms and
pination angle that's real biomechanic
yeah where you actually measure these
are numerical
this is like
funk providing numerical clues to the
functional anatomy perspective and those
are important in my opinion
you can calculate what percentage of the
force is effective at that joint action
you know what i mean and things like
that by using like trigonometry like
socato remember that i don't know yeah
okay so um
then you have force plate research now
this is another thing that used to be
used a lot people would be like well
i've done those studies
uh jump squats are like basically a trap
bar jump squat creates more force on the
force plate than
a power clean for a fraction of a second
so it should be used more my problem
with that is like
i was i remember writing a blog post
okay so in that sense quarter squats
would be better than full screen right
right if you have a mechanical advantage
sometimes it's better to use the dissent
the that is that's hardest
because you have to use less external
load to generate the same
intramuscular tension and then you get
more hypertrophy for less weight on the
bar and less injury risk but you can
look you can still you can do an
exercise on a force but you can look at
the forces the power the rate of force
development the impulse the work those
are the things we look at i don't think
it's very predictive of anything well
it's great for sport performance but
maybe i like you can look at did it
increase your performance but can you
use that to predict what's best for
this exercise let me think about it
shrugs would be huge
should all athletes be doing shrugs
because they have high
power output or sorry high force output
i don't i don't know maybe maybe not but
anyway
just mentioning all the tools that we
use the sport scientists okay so next up
is the muscle
uh basically the force angle curves so
you have three curves that are created
the passive
the passive force
that's the force that's generated
through stretch
then you have the active curve that's
the force generated through contraction
then you have the total curve which is
the sum of those two
that's an area i believe that we need to
keep exploring because muscles are
different we don't know enough about
that yet
we know andrew doesn't think it's all
that brad and i do we think there's
something to it we know andrew's smart
on us but that doesn't well smart people
have never been wrong so he's right for
sure that doesn't mean we don't
investigate it and maybe it leads to
something maybe it doesn't
however
all muscles are they have different
resting sarcomere lengths different
moment arms so you get different levels
of stretch different levels of active
tension throughout the range of motion
but we don't even know enough to
we don't know enough right now to know
if that's important it's something we
need to build upon but we can make
instagram posts about it pretending we
know and it sounds sciencey
especially if we throw in
titan and hippo yap
filament c bag three like all this lag
three always sounded perverse
random about them your bag
give you a bag
okay so
then there's musculoskeletal modeling
okay
jared and i have used open sim before
that's uh that they can use modeling to
show now modeling has has its faults
because you're relying on assumptions
you have to model the human body it's
not easy to the musculoskeletal system
is not easy to do so there's flaws in
the system but again it's a puzzle piece
we have a lot of data on that too though
so it's pretty accurate
it's pretty accurate but not perfect but
i found some stuff where like if you go
deep like in some muscles it will rev
because think about the glutes if you go
super deep it
it would pass through the yeah it
doesn't wrap around yes they don't i
think it's the wrapping it's linear
modeling it's not yeah yeah they don't
have a wrapping mechanism sometimes so
it's not perfect but it's a to me like
emg it's a hell of a lot better than
you know johnny bros opinion who's just
you know shouting at everyone that this
exercise sucks
and then finally a couple more you have
acute protein synthesis that's measured
through biopsy and then you have
intracellular signaling those are things
like we can look at mtor mapk akt
calcium dependent paths pathways
uh
you know we can look at all those and
other complex words i don't brad knows
this stuff that like well i rely on him
to know this
and i try to know the biomechanics stuff
i know the physio
[Laughter]
but
like we know mtor is important so if
mtor goes up
after this exercise but again it's
probably a good thing it's probably a
good thing but it's rare right how many
like you don't hear bros in the gym
being like no
don't do those lap prayers they did not
activate mtor where this did i got one
like what are you training today bro
like amateur like my man
and then the last one in this category
is
p-a-p-e it used to be called pap post
activation potentiation
what researchers realized was pap
activation potentiation is like the
phosphorylation of the light myosin
chains or something it's not
that's only a small part of it it's a
subset it's a subset it doesn't even
correlate to the actual time points
that you're getting this enhancement so
you can get enhancement for several
different reasons
basically this is just for performance
this wouldn't be for like hypertrophy
right
but if you're looking at performance and
this exercise
uh
you know potentiates your performance
it's probably a good exercise for that
sport yeah you know but again these
these this whole numerical clues
and all the common sense clues let you
generate hypotheses
it's just
you're theorizing then the longitudinal
clues are what
measure that
so then the next category is the
longitudinal clues
these are the ones where you're actually
looking at hypertrophy
one kind of problem with hypertrophy
research well
all the studies have flaws for example
you know there's two studies i'm
skeptical of
uh one call out time
you guys probably love these team full
realm over here love these studies i'm
skeptical
one study by kubo showing that full
squats
developed the glutes and adductors way
better than
i don't know if those half squats but
basically partials yeah it matters how
you do them so let's say
all right
let's say i'm on a smith machine
i feel like my quads are going to
upstage your guys's right now
i'll come on they're enormous please put
them away
jared can't even put his quads away in
here
okay let's say you're on a smith machine
and you do a smith machine full squat
you
you go all the way to here and you're
upright this is going to work your quads
and glutes really well boom now let's
see on that same
machine you just go like this
you're not even working your glutes at
all because you're not sitting back but
let's say you take a low bar position
i get a wide stance and i go like this i
feel this in my glutes a ton
so you don't know
you don't always know how they did the
study so real quick i'd love to comment
on that because i've been involved in
like a bit of exercise science research
myself like directly being there i've
been a subject i've been a graduate
researcher i've been above that level
etc
and
one trippy thing is like when people
will say
oh like they studied you know this
exercise versus this or this squat or
sack squat and they'll come up with some
kind of zany results sometimes and the
thing is if it what is it like it's like
if you really like uh hot dogs or
sausages and you really like laws don't
ever watch them get made because they'll
never consume laws
like sometimes they'll be like this is a
squat and you'll see like some harry
potter asthma undergraduate
doing something and they're like that's
a squat he did it and i'm like oh
like like
that's not that's really bastardized
version it's not doing the thing josh so
that's why i trust my studies because i
know they were carried out well because
i'm a i'm a strength coach for so many
years i trust my research i don't always
trust because funny one time andrew and
i were uh we were looking up someone's
um
okay so a researcher posted something he
goes why is that name familiar he's like
andrew's like an idiot savant he's like
a
rain man you know i remember
we're literally in vegas right now
andrew now stop what you're doing
biomechanics whatever get over here
stop saving the world and get over here
and help us make money so
he went and found the researcher he
found their instagram and then we looked
at the study
and in the study they say
we did these according to the
you know methods of like hip thrusts
according to brett contreras
initial paper published like technique
hip thrust technique papers published in
sdj i can see where this is going then
you looked at the the researcher posted
a
a video
and it was like on instagram like
testing testing 1rm testing for my study
chest was up they weren't locking out it
was like not the same form so just
because they said it was and that's
where
so this is a flaw not just with
longitudinal research because these same
errors would exist thank you these same
errors that would exist if they were
measuring
short-term acute research too you don't
know how they do it this is why i don't
like when people are saying they're
performing studies and there's no actual
data on their studies
because it's like
people will come to me and say this
exercise doesn't work the glutes or
doesn't do this like we love single
deficit deadlifts and i'll watch
somebody do them and i'm like that's
everything about that is just a sumo
deadlift with your ass way up in the air
so get so you have to give them actual
cues which sometimes i'm not even sure
that these other researchers which that
aren't also research of course they're
not even familiar with the key a lot of
researchers need to lift weights yeah so
they're like like you need to get your
hips under you you need to actually use
the glutes like you're getting the super
from the hips not from the stance like
 like that i don't think people
would say that kind of stuff no it's
probably a 50 50 50 percent of guys
guys like us who came from weightlifting
they go into research they want to
publish on right but then like another
50 percent don't well i don't know what
they're doing my issue is that some
people do know what they're doing and
they use that to their advantage to make
their study look like you should know
better well there was the the one that
actually dishonest except for the people
that i'm talking about don't actually
they're not actually in academia no i
like
the the the story about the one
researcher who
he wanted the results to come out a
certain way so he was what did what did
he call that
what did andrew call that and in medical
science you have something to your
studies that's where you're
intentionally trying to know the abs um
the um
i can't remember what he said it's a
it's a researcher by it's the the
research is terminology unknowingly yeah
i know there's a term for it but some
people do the opposite and it's very
academically dishonest yeah so um
so yeah
you know that one guy who i think
eventually just started making up his
own data
my man right but before the collecting
date is hard before then it was like he
would want this group to win out so
before they got the mri he'd give him
you know load them up on creatine for a
few dollars high carb high carb them and
make sure they're super hydrated because
that comes out what's the end game for
that like what are you well
that's the thing there are
but there aren't that many there are
only a couple that we know of that are
you know corrupt like like rats like
they they turn to the dark side by jacob
wilson
whoa that's
literally literally boss fight studies
what he did that's what he was talking
about yeah oh well oh no yeah i
didn't know if he did stuff like that
statistics
i think he got to the point where he
just started making things up it's not
here kristen was involved in those
studies yeah it's not here at all he
lost his position and everything
christian kristen was involved in the
remember kristin
yeah yeah she was involved in those and
she's like yeah happened
okay
so you have that happen there's just
you know that that's not very often i
don't want people to like distrust
research because there's a couple of bad
eggs but
all but the main thing you just can't
assume all of it is like truth down
given from god well like there should
also be some research but
here's also peer-reviewed research
performed in my lab the way this system
was created peer review it's all written
typed up written
that's antiquated that's before
the internet yeah we should have a video
clip that accompanies yes here's a video
clip so you can see then we could go yes
this kubota and the other study i have
that i would like to duplicate is the
cedar leg curl versus the lying leg curl
do you guys think c delay curls are
really better for hamstring growth than
lying leg curls i don't even deal and
 like that like i don't know yeah i
love
like so it also depends on how you place
lying red curl like if you put some pads
underneath your legs or if you have a
machine that stretches your ham out a
little bit then you have a huge
structure right like like so then you
get a very similar effect right another
thing about that is like
when people say well one is better than
the other it's like well like you're
gonna never do a lying leg curl again
right what if you get tired of doing
seated leg curls even if they're like
martial exactly you're just gonna be
like no
do that
you use both the machines you get in
you're like this thing was made for me
yes and the other this machine sucks i
don't care if it's seated or not yeah
right right a lot of it is cueing too
like i'll actively actively resist my
hips moving backwards when i do a lying
leg curl so i'll keep my hips forward so
that i can actually stretch the
hamstring more yeah most people don't do
that and they don't think about that
stuff so like i hate lying late girls
i'm just going to do seeds it's like how
about you try this cue and then they're
like oh that's awesome
delicious you have these published
studies and it's like there's one they
have not been duplicated and you don't
know exactly how they did it because
they don't video clips
so anyway this is a drawback of not just
longitudinal but also for sure um acute
research like uh with the numerical
clues you don't know exactly how the
researchers did them
but anyway also with longitudinal
research with hypertrophy there's some
like you can do glute girth or girth of
arm girth but measuring tape measuring
but like what if you just gained a bunch
of weight right you could gain fat you
could be measuring biceps very imprecise
and the triceps could grow yeah you know
so that's kind of on the low end
then you have you know ultrasound you've
got dexa
you've got
bioelectrical impedance you've got bod
pod you've got underwater weighing
you've got skin fold
then you can combine
them now now you've got like these
like you know
four component models where you combine
for example skin fold with girth or you
know you have ct scans you have mri but
you can combine modalities and then it
makes it even more accurate
that's out of my league but that's for
hypertrophy with strength the kind of
the the way we measure strength
you can either look at
isometric strength concentric strength
or eccentric strength you can use a
dynamometer to measure like single joint
strength you can use a force plate uh
you can use you can do a one rep max or
just like a rep like rep out and use a
prediction equation
those are the ways we measure strength
performance we can basically
you can look at activities of daily
living if you're dealing with like
elderly like sit to stand
like this here
they increase that they decrease that
time then they're more functional
you can look at like
basically acceleration or top speed
sprinting
vertical or horizontal jump you can look
at agility and change the direction test
you can look at rotational power and
things like that but
these are the ones that these
longitudinal tests are the ones that
actually measure what you're trying to
measure
again in a perfect world we'd have a
hundred of these studies but we don't
so
how can we best
judge and it's like
how many of those apply to what we're
talking about here it's not like we can
go all right
lat prayer
have you ever seen anything looking at
creatine kinase or lactate of a leopard
no you don't we don't have that
but
we have functional anatomy we have the
feel doms you know we have to give you a
pump does it give you a burn
does it make sense with the
do we know momentums and pination angles
things like that we can look at that
and make a judgment
but i'm
really against the bashing of exercises
i don't like that i don't like this
exercise is stupid when people say that
that really gets to me because
i'm just glad people are exercising and
every if you're a trainer like me
one thing that's different about me in
this in this uh instagram age
there's no practitioners anymore
oh no one's actually coaching anyone
anymore i won't do that
you work with a lot like you'll do
workouts with people so that's way
better than just trying to train myself
for sure
i've trained a lot of people over the
years you have strong workout partners
that that increases your because if you
didn't you just go by what you know but
you'll look at jerry like jared likes
this exercise i don't or well that's
like that's a really good point there's
something very humbling when you talk to
other people about the exercises they
like and they're smart and they're
strong and they've been at it for a
while and they come to a slightly
different conclusion than you like if i
was like jared was like i love hack
spots and i'm like well i think leg
presses are better i'd be like well you
know jared's a smart guy he knows what
he's doing is it really just like
i'm correct and he's dumb or maybe some
bodies are built differently or maybe
both exercises are effective a lot of
that nuance gets lost especially people
say look this is a stupid exercise like
in order to make that convincing case
because some exercises really are stupid
but usually it's kind of obvious and in
order to make a convincing case you're
going to have to show that a bunch of
the stuff you talked about
all most of those factors are like dum
dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
but usually positive exercises um
sumo knees in
1 8 squat for quads i mean has anyone
ever prescribed that
i'm sure yes i've seen a leg press
actually
all the time like uh people are like
just like like this
yeah and it's like a 1 8 it's scary to
watch but that's just like not for
thinking people right so you can you can
say this exercise is stupid but then
it's relatively obvious why it's stupid
but if an exercise is stupid except a
lot of smart people use it and it seems
to work for them and half of that
you know all the equation factors you
talked about half of those say that
exercise is probably good
just bashing that exercise with one of
those factors like so for example people
say well you know that sort of the
diagrammatical biomechanics don't add up
like well the muscle diagram says lat
should be weak at this angle but then
hundreds of people you talk to like when
i go full rom or whatever i do this kind
of exercise that's supposed to be bad i
get crazy tension crazy burn crazy doms
crazy pump my last grew a ton oh and by
the way there's other biomechanical
reasoning that says that's good like the
internal forces are still really high
even though the external load drops off
and then a couple of you know studies
support that this exercise does actually
provide hypertrophy well just using the
diagrammatical biomechanics you'll be
like ah see it doesn't make sense from
this factor it ignores the 18 other
factors that are in support of the hence
my puzzle pieces exactly that's why
the puzzle piece is not a good idea
right so
so that's how you can kind of judge uh
this is how you can evaluate an expert
too who like not x like we're actually
who's not like you're not one of the
cocky feel we're experts but like we are
we have a lot of expertise with weight
training we're you know respected in the
field
but you look at the experts out there
and you're like
all the legit experts would consider all
the pieces of the puzzle right yeah you
won't have any expert that's like no
sensation means nothing emg means
nothing only this this is everything
yeah you don't you you would you would
you would you would like only functional
anatomy it makes it gets the clicks
it gets the click and with functional
anatomy you can look at things like
like all right sometimes you can this
way emg comes in handy you can be like
looking at that this muscle should be
well suited for the job what if you
measure the emg and it doesn't register
anything
yeah you know yeah
there's that that that has happened with
me before
um i have a hypothesis as to why people
are so drawn
to single factor explanations it's
because
you know for a variety of reasons uh you
know obviously lack of intelligence
could be one of them but also an
intimidation with complexity and nuance
leads people to just want one thing to
be the answer and if you draw a pretty
picture a little coloring book medical
diagram and they're like that's how that
works do that then they can say oh
it like i just have the answer i don't
have to wade into the swampy waters of
like ah and i gotta take a
conglomeration of evidence from a bunch
of factors i don't even know what
 agglomeration means i'm pretty
sure i just made that word up cool
good part of this video is that you're
providing that puzzle though because
it's
at least to me it seems very simplistic
that there's like a three-tiered system
here's what we can look at here here's
what you can look at here right here's
all the that's like very complex
you don't necessarily have to look at
right those people that forced me to
make this because i was like sure i'm
tired of getting i'm tired again i don't
think those guys realize that we're
getting bashed you're causing us to get
bashed all the time from doing exercise
that we like and feel i mean especially
in category one we use that on our
templates like soreness and pump are two
of our proxies for yeah should the
volume increase
that's literally how we're doing it like
our templates
and it's like if you're getting a pump
and it's really good you don't have to
do any more sets you're doing a good job
if you're getting super sore you don't
have to do any more sets right and
people like it doesn't work like that
i'm like okay
describe me how it works like you're
going to have can you imagine i have a
client that's like like you're halfway
through a workout they're like my glutes
are so blown up i can barely move you're
like all right keep going and then and
then keep going like how many more sets
like until whatever 10. we drove 10 down
that's what you have to do like you know
okay
it's based on those actual factors you
wrote down which is awesome
real quick to your point about um people
wanting a single factor
my colleague jordan jordan menda guccia
he's a researcher from spain
he made this uh he and matt brugeli uh
who's mike he used to teach at eut where
i got my phd they wrote this
game-changing article on hamstring
injury prevention and they talked about
how people like to be reductionists
why did you tear your hamstring jared
well
mike would go well it's because you know
you don't have a strong hand look at
your quads you don't have strong
hamstrings and then i would say it's
because of your flexibility dude you go
like this and no it's this it's never
one factor it's
your skeletal anatomy
you know if you have a larger moment
like if you stick out further from the
joint center you're probably putting
more stress on that real quick the only
thing out of my head was like like a
skeleton diagram of like that person's
like scan and be like your skeleton is
what we in science called made and
you're just going to get hurt a lot
so then
you're also the architecture of the
muscle the you know the
um maybe you're over trained
well that's fatigue are you fatigued of
fatigue throws off your body running
your technique your flexibility your
foot okay with the hamstring it's your
core strength and your kind of like
pelvic control because if you anterior
pelvic tilt that stretches the hamstring
more
that influence what happens to the
pelvis affects the the hamstring so your
glute activation things like that night
your core strength your eccentric
hamstring strength
your flexion how strong the other
muscles are
if you have weak hamstrings but the rest
of you is weak you just never go fast
enough to hurt your hamstrings yes right
but if you have enormous loots and quads
like your hamstrings are on a
string that sucks who's the pt uh people
that like
reduce everything back to the glutes
they're saying everything that's
possibly wrong with you is the glute
that's
[Music]
can you imagine like you get hurt you go
to the doctor he's like measures your
glute strength like dude aren't you the
glute guy okay like you shouldn't be
hurt this doesn't make any sense i hurt
my elbow falling down like nope all the
way there's your glutes
yeah but um but it's also prior to
injury because that yes if you have a
bow if you break your bone it heals back
stronger if you do a soft tissue injury
it's going to have
slightly biomechanical inferior
and the scar tissue replaces the active
tissue yeah
freaking screwed now because i have acl
hamstring graft so anytime i go to my
like full range of motion to my ass like
with a single leg ham curl i just cramp
yeah it's just weak it's so so it's a
multifaceted but people want this simple
single answer where it's we tend to be
reductionists because it's just a
simpler this is why this happened for
this reason it's really a blend of
reasons yeah and what's going to happen
is you're just going to by being a
productionist and if you buy into the
sort of diagrammatical
process as the king way of knowing
you're just going to rule out a lot of
exercises that are good and like
artificially condense your variation to
like two or three movements and then
what happens when you get you know hurt
on one of them what happens when one of
them gets stale on you like what are you
do
there's only one best lad exercise so
one when that one's stale after eight
months of continuous training do you
switch to nothing so this is my point
with these these guys are outing
themselves
that they're not real coaches they're
not real trainers they don't really
train themselves well so
exactly because
i work with so many people i have
probably 40 different people i work with
in person okay
and
god i'm always writing i'm writing
programs every night
and i'm always trying to make it
interesting for them so it's the same
but different philosophy like we're
always doing variations of squats
deadlifts hip thrusts
single leg movements um you know upper
body presses upper body pulls single
isolation movements but it's always like
oh god i've been training this person
for five years i know what she she wants
i don't know what her goals are but i
also know she needs some new stuff
so we like real people work with a lot
of people we love exercises we love
variations we see someone like not
saying these like foo foo crazy things
but we like
you know what are the ways to what are
the what are the ways to to work your
lats yeah in isolation it's there's not
many within the constraint of what is a
good exercise it's not one it may be
five or ten yeah and then five or ten
exercises is something you could rotate
in an hour yeah if you're looking for
the one best exercise and then sorry
so when those people say things and also
when they say things like everyone
should be squatting with a narrow stance
oh that just shows that you as soon as
you say everyone yeah everyone has
a heart that's probably correct
maybe not even some people have
mechanical hearts yeah so you you say
that something like you don't really
work with people because
you know i could like every time i see
some black and white statement i go that
would work with these clients that would
not work with these clients
and that's what i guess it frustrates me
is that
um
these people i think what gets them
writing these making these posts is they
get i remember when i moved to new
school in third grade
i did i want i had no friends and i
realized if i started swearing a lot
that people i got attention
i don't even think that is that my life
now
i still don't have any friends so that
didn't work it wouldn't even make any
sense i'd just be like
ass like you know like that's so cool i
would have thought you were so cool and
people were like whoa the new guy
the new guy is hardcore
so um
so i i think that happens on social
media if you make a post and you're
bashing an exercise and it's your most
popular post
you're like oh my god they like me
i'm gonna do more of it and
they're not thinking globally of what's
best for the field sure they're just
thinking of themselves they're thinking
of that you know they're not thinking of
what's best for the field and what's
this and also
when you're out there trying to save the
world and you think that you can come up
with some um you can like
some revelation every week right you're
reaching you did not do the homework
necessary like how often do you the
three other revolutions in the field
come every couple of years yeah i
thought i've never had a revolutionary
moment uh you know when i'm a
psychedelic sure but those aren't real
revelations like the elephant's my
friend you don't have an elephant my
clique he was my friend while i had him
that's all i have to say so like if
you're coming up with stuff every month
yeah that's like guys i just figured
this out this is always controversial
too it always calls out a lot of people
like
if somebody has to be the villain like
these trainers making youtube loot
thruster idiots and they're wrong
i wrote this years ago it's so funny
nothing's changed yeah i wrote these
blog posts in 2010. here's the way they
do it and it's it's the same thing
you come up with your own terminology
for the exercises these ones are good
these ones are bad
you know and then um you know you always
have to have a villain so that you can
emerge as the hero you know folks
brett's pissed
jared remains always pissed me i'm a
happy-go-lucky guy i just want to be
friends with everyone
actually anyone please be my friend
we'll probably link the thing and if we
don't it's brett's fault
jared would you up to now got any
announcements anything to say
i'm sick jared's sick he lost his voice
he's not it doesn't actually sound that
tough brett actually sounds looks like a
pirate sounds like a super tough guy's a
deep voice i don't have a deep voice and
