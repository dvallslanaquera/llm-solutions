hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization today's topic
are the three types of fitness goals
that you can have
and how to use them properly to become
your very best
most fittest person fittest just
not most fittest here we go three types
of goals from motivational psychology
process goals performance goals and
outcome goals let's take a look at what
each of the three
actually mean when you are set out to do
something let's say
change your fitness in some way the
process
goals are actually the smallest types of
goals
their goals like i'm
going to make four clean meals today and
i'm going to eat them
on time properly and finishing them and
eating no more no less
i'm going to go to bed on time today i'm
going to show up to train and
actually train with the following
training plan process goals
are goals to execute the daily hour to
hour minute to minute process
of becoming more fit those are process
goals
now process goals are very important but
there's a second
longer time horizon view of performance
goals
if you are eating your meals on time
getting all your training and getting to
bed on time so on and so forth you would
expect
that your fitness improves in some way
and it's good to have goals
to make sure that you're on track with
that degree of improvement
that you think is reasonable we'll get
to the reasonable part later for example
if you are dieting to lose fat then
maybe
once a week or on average over multiple
ways per week you should be losing
like at least a pound to a pound and a
half of weight on the scale
that is an example of a performance goal
yes the process of eating the meals
maybe is going well
hopefully but you can confirm your
process
is accurate by having performance goals
that reflect it it's like building a
fighter plane
you do all the process of putting in the
wrenches in the right spaces and
tightening the right bolts and designing
the engine
once that process is complete you'd
better hope that the plane can break
mach 2
if it can't break back to it can't fly
fast something is wrong with your
process
so the best part about performance goals
is to keep your process
in check if you are eating like you're
supposed to you should be losing weight
like you're supposed to or gaining it
like you're supposed to
with what of course is reasonable if you
are training like you're supposed to you
should be getting stronger week to week
month to month stuff like that so
performance goals can be strength based
performance based they can be you know
any kind of like
i hit a certain volume and certain uh my
reps didn't drop off
i am losing a certain amount of weight
i'm gaining a certain amount of weight
they can even be
like my bicep circumference has improved
a certain amount
they're measurable they're objective
they're not what actually get the work
done because you could
pray and hope that your biceps get
bigger and measure them all the time
measuring your biceps doesn't make them
bigger training
process goals do but performance goals
are nonetheless important because you
could have a process you think works
you never check your performance months
later you finally check it you realize
like oh
i actually have been spinning my wheels
something i'm doing my process is wrong
so performance goals are next level and
they're super important
now here's the deal we don't get our
biceps bigger
to just see a certain tape measurement
it's never really about the performance
goals in most cases
it's about that last tier of goals
that's the longest time horizon
outcome goals outcome goals is what you
really want out of the equation
big end process goals are are major
targets of your success
for example yeah the process is going
well
if your performance reflects that you're
losing a pound and a half
per week but your goal maybe over 10
weeks was to lose 15 pounds
that's your outcome goal you said to
yourself at the beginning of the diet
i'm going to lose 15 pounds in these 10
weeks reasonable
that's your outcome now how do you know
you're doing it well
if every week the process is being
executed
the process goals are being met like
you're well on your way but how do you
know for sure
well the performance goals are being
checked off every week you lose about a
pound and a half awesome
and then at the end of the day the
process goals
executing the change the performance
goals keeping you on track
the outcome goals let you know where to
go
simpler example doing this with your car
steering wheel and pressing on the
pedals and checking the turn signals and
stuff
is the process by which you drive to
your destination
the performance is is the speedometer
between 60 and 70 or whatever and look
at your clock is okay
my 900 miles away from seattle right now
great i'm on time
that's the performance goals okay so
like if you get to
900 miles away from seattle like three
hours later then you thought you're like
oh good god i'm not going to make this
event that i'm driving my car to seattle
for
but what is the outcome it's to get to
seattle for that event
this is the only reason you're doing
anything right there's no inherent
big value in this case of just doing you
don't get into your garage
and keep your car off and do maybe when
you're eight you don't just turn your
wheel and
press the pedals that's fun but doesn't
get you anywhere so the outcome goal has
to be there in some sense
because that's why you're doing all this
stuff the performance goal has to be
there because you got to make sure you
do it
on time in a just a judicious manner but
you'll get nowhere fast if you're like
all right we got to make it to seattle
in nine hours
all right we're still sitting in our car
the car is not on
you got to turn the car on you got to do
this with the steering wheel and you got
to press the pedals to actually make
things happen
so there needs to be a flow
to your goals you need outcome goals to
direct your
efforts right and without them
consistent motivation suffers greatly
just like if you're going to seattle for
a really big concert the reason
you're smashing red bulls and doing a
whole lot of this it's not that fun
after six hours right
is the motivation of seeing your
favorite person in concert which is of
course
for you the viewer billy eilish right
you want to go to billy eilish concert
you love her and
that's the reason that's what keeps you
motivated to actually drive just the
same way in fitness
you want to be strong you want to squat
400 pounds for the first time in your
life
now when one does not simply squad 400
you got to put five pounds on the bar
every time that's the process
you got to execute the workouts that's
the process you got to make sure you're
gaining oh 10 pounds of strength 15
pounds of strength every month that's
the performance goals but the outcome
goals like
if your goal is to just get stronger and
it's very hazy sometimes motivation can
suffer so
i want to gain to where i weigh 210
pounds i'm going to squat 400 pounds i
want to lose i want to do this i want to
look like that
those outcome goals are very very good
idea to have
because they keep you pointed in the
right direction all the time now
performance goals keep you on track and
the process goals power that journey
but that journey has to go somewhere and
nothing replaces outcome goals for
that for the performance goals you need
them to keep you on track look
process goals power the journey and you
have outcome goals
to know where you want to end up but you
got to ask yourself the question is
is this powerful process actually
getting me to where i need to go
if you have markers of performance along
the way if you have those goals
then it's pretty clear that you're on
track or if you're not on track
you alternate the process goals you
change them so my goal used to be
to eat four meals of 750 calories each
but i'm not losing weight fast enough so
now
it's gonna be four meals of 650 calories
we could change the process goals
in order to hit the performance
milestones in order to get to your
outcome and not to something else
but here i'm not going to sugarcoat this
this is absolutely the truth here
process goals are the most important
because they are what get you the actual
results
period you can want to lose weight
i want to lose 15 pounds if you do you
can measure you can step on a scale
every day great
and i know people you know people like
this they want to lose weight they step
on the scale all the time they fret
about it and what do they do they cheat
on their diet all the time
you got to eat the meals and not much
more than the meals if you want to lose
weight if you want to gain weight you
got to smash protein and carbs and train
really hard
period and if you don't do that it
doesn't matter you tell people in the
gym yeah i'm trying to get jacked
and you're like put a picture flex
wheeler on your mirror and you're like
that's the goal man
if you don't do the work it's all
pointless
on the other hand someone who eats the
meals
does the training and has no performance
goals at all or no outcome goals
not optimal they could be on more than
just going off in a weird direction
however six times seven times out of ten
they're going in the right direction
anyway look if you're smashing food and
pumping the weights like crazy you're
going to get more jacked you're going to
look
more like flex wheeler than when you
started period
that's the engine of everything that
happens so process goals
are the most important by a long shot so
to succeed you should have outcome goals
they should be
challenging but realistic you get no
bonus points making unrealistic goals
you you can tell yourself you want to be
mr olympia how about this
mr southern ohio let's start with that
writer actually
build a muscular and lean physique first
and then mr southern ohio and then mr
usa and then mr olympia how about that
right
so realistic but challenging performance
goals are absolutely a good idea and
real big fans of having them for example
shameless plug the rp diet app
it tells you your process goals eat this
eat this eat that and then
it also tracks your performance to make
sure that you're on track so it can
change your process for you
but also let you know like hey you're
doing super well you pick the outcome at
the front end it doesn't talk to you
about the outcome all the time
it really just focuses on process and
performance and that performance is
critical so performance
very very good to make sure you keep it
on track performance should be as
objective as possible
so if your idea of a performance goal
for bodybuilding just kind of looking in
the mirror and like yeah i think i'm
getting more jacked
that's fine but it should be paired with
other more objective measurements are
you gaining weight or losing weight if
you're cutting
are you getting stronger in the gym over
time that kind of stuff you can't really
fudge right and
then it really keeps you super honest
and the point is not a moral point you
can light yourself all you want
you can't lie to the process if the
process is working
the honesty should reflect that it's
really doing a good job if the process
goals
are not being executed sufficiently or
if they're wrong right if you're on a
hypochloric diet where you should be
gaining
you're not going to get scale weight you
can't lie to that right it keeps you
truthful to the very things you think
are important
right they should be performance goals
realistic big deal
don't set performance goals that are
unrealistic look i want to squat i want
to add 20 pounds to my squat every week
what are you talking about go with five
and if you really blow that out of the
water it's the easiest thing in the
world next month you can do
7.5 every week and really impress
everyone including yourself
they should be regular okay so
performance is not something you test
like once
during uh an entire fat loss phase okay
you don't like not step on the scale
i think i'm doing well i think i'm doing
well and it's a three month fat loss
diet and
at week six one and a half way or you
know through or half halfway through
you're like uh step on the scale and
you're like oh i haven't lost any weight
or you step on the scale and you're
actually like
five pounds already lost more than you
wanted and you're like oh crap
right so they should be regular like
there's no exact number
but regularly spaced and relatively
often now they don't have to be
preservative
they don't have to be like every hour i
check my weight but you know check your
weight a few times a week
every week you should get strength
measurements for how you're doing stuff
like that
and of course they should be progressive
like i perform at
x level here and then you know next week
x plus one or x plus two so on and so
forth
that keeps you on track to get to your
outcome because your outcome
hopefully is a progression from where
you started
right if your outcome goal is exactly
where you are already their performance
goals don't need to be progressive so
they need to have all those features to
be really really good
they don't have to be elaborate and
super precise just the basics work
really really well
but process goals are the most important
because they determine how you
live they literally make the success
measuring that you benched 300 pounds
today
doesn't make you better at benching if
you bench 300 but nobody measure it you
know
tree falls in the woods doesn't make a
sound by the way the answer that
question is unequivocal
yes but backtracking if you bench 300
but you know how much weight is on the
bar
it doesn't matter because you either did
it or you didn't it doesn't matter if
you know about it
what matters is did you do the 250 for
sets of five
that's what makes you stronger so the
process goals are critical because
they're the movers they're the prime
movers right
if you have a race car that has no
speedometer
but you put a ball or driver in the shit
he's going to win a bunch of races
why tires engine transmission
that's it okay that the engine is what
wins the races
plus the driver of course if there's no
speedometer you might make his job
harder
but it it's really way superfluous
compared to the motive force
behind actually doing stuff so invest
most of your time into process goals
not wild dream outcome goals or
meticulous performance goals you see a
ton of people do this kind of stuff
the overthinker okay will track tons of
variables
and not train hard enough or not diet
properly the bro
will have outcome goals like man one day
i'm gonna be the next arnold
but doesn't track anything for
performance nor does he try
super hard in the gym or uh at the
dinner table right so
no there's no bonus for having really
exorbitant outcome goals and you can
measure whatever the hell you want
if you're not process goaling properly
if you're not moving the needle
physically then it doesn't really matter
what you're measuring or what you want
to happen
you have to do the actual things to
finish this out if i were a betting man
if i were a gambling man
you gave me a choice i would take by a
long shot
a person with pretty hazy outcome goals
for example
someone who you're like hey look what do
you want to do in the sport of
bodybuilding they're like i don't know
like
i want to be super lean and jacked and
maybe compete like that's not exactly
like oh i'm gonna be mr olympian in the
year 2031
like that's definitely not that right
it's very very hazy
and maybe not so regular performance
goals like
sometimes they go a while without really
testing their strength
uh and they just like you know go in the
gym and hit it hard
but if they're nailing the process goals
i'm betting on that person the person
that eats the meals
that doesn't skip training you show me a
motherfucker that gets his meals in and
gets his training in
it hits it hard week after week after
week that is the person nine out of ten
times who's going to be successful
and actually end up nailing outcome
goals that the other person didn't get
the other person
the other archetype is a person with pie
in the sky outcome goals i'm gonna be mr
olympia
which is nothing wrong with that goal as
long as your process is set in
in motion right and a lot of people have
super strict performance goals like are
you measuring like
i make sure i go always train a failure
at the end of every mesocycle just so i
can measure and compare my results and
oh my tricep extension went down a
little bit my skull crusher went up and
what does that mean
that's all good and well again as long
as your process is really set in motion
so by a million times i would choose
someone more process oriented
versus performance and outcome
especially outcome oriented
outcome goals are sexy in a
large portion of society and in social
media and multimedia
they're what are really cool to talk
about right people love to talk about
that shit it's inspiring when athletes
were like i wanted to
win the olympics ever since i was six
like wow
it's not it's fun to be like so what's
your typical day like when i wake up
have protein shake
choke that down i try not to throw up
then go train for two hours
then i have another protein shake try
not to throw that up hey yeah that's
kind of cool
more for us nitty-gritty people that
actually train regular folks who end up
setting fitness goals
the way they consume sports and fitness
media they're obsessed with outcome
stuff
and people talk about their goals all
the time like the people you know at
work that are trying to get fit what are
they always talking about like i'm going
to lose 15 pounds or what do you think
like can i gain muscle
rarely are they talking about like hey
day to day how should i be eating
because i know it's different
they talk about even diets in terms of
outcome goals like i'm going to do the
keto diet
like it seems like you're giving
yourself a gold star for trying a diet
like you can talk about whatever you
want
are you going to actually do it right
one of those guys in our example
the person who focuses on process goals
is probably getting jacked and strong
and lean and the other is probably just
writing checks to himself
he can't cash if the process isn't there
so should you have outcome goals
totally but they're not super important
even if they're hazy that's totally fine
should you have performance goals
they're more important you should have
them they should be regular and
objective
but they don't need to be super
elaborate should you have process goals
you can't live without them they are the
motive force behind changes in fitness
folks give that some thought see you
next time for the next lecture
