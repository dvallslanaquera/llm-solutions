[Music]
i forgot my coffee so i feel tired
but i have you here
my last videos where i was talking
charlie's like damn he was right about
all that talking
and they changed it what up uh
first exercise for charlie is a push
down either drop sit
or mile rep uh he told me what he was
doing
i've been doing a push on variation as
well again we didn't want to cause any
novelty stimulus
so he's grabbing the attachment right
now that he's been using for his messa
cycle i'm just going to switch to that
one
you'll see the footage that's what we'll
be doing
[Music]
god damn
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
i started the prep for this first
bodybuilding show
on january 4th or 5th total length
will be 18 weeks we're taking
an 18 week prep period because
for one to ease myself into it it is my
first show
so we kind of want to take a measured
approach
uh the longer you have a prep the more
time you have to
uh make adjustments the first i'd say
three or four weeks
uh we had um a deficit
uh that wasn't harsh at all but gave us
time to see
how that affected my body composition
i think it was the right of person's
take because
to be quite honest this prep and the
diet
hunger it was easy
very easy i've never needed a lot of
work for my triceps
which one whatever one you want i'm not
picky about this one because i don't go
heavy
on this one it's more of my triceps
anyway next exercise for charlie's
final week of hard training he's
sticking with a neutral get press it's a
little bit different machine than what
he was using
but very similar pulling the fibers and
everything
so either 185 225 depends
and i believe he's in the 15 to 20 rep
range here so again just
providing enough stimulus to keep the
muscle around last hard week
he's good to go increases nutrients next
week
[Music]
[Music]
this
[Music]
alright
uh
oh
before this prep the longest diving
phase
similar to what i've done here
was last year we were actually going to
have my first show
uh right around the same time last year
but as
we all know covet happened so all the
shows got cancelled
but the great part about that was
blessing the skies collecting
all that data so the type of data we
collected
obviously macros how that affected my
body weight we even tracked sodium
and fluids and steps and
luckily having a lot of data moving into
this prep where we are now helped
tremendously
because there is very little adjustment
to make and we
knew already how that passed dna was
going to affect
my current prep so
yeah it was a blessing besides i'd say
[Music]
so for this pm session we include the
triceps and the lateral delts uh just
kind of how the frequency plays out for
this mesocycle for charlie
and we've linked our stuff together so
we're doing a
dumbbell he's doing a seated dumbbell
lateral because it's the closest thing
to a seated machine that we have
just again keeping the variations very
similar um i'm doing a sanding double
lateral raise
and then we have one more dell exercise
i believe it's a rear delt focus
and that will conclude the pm session
[Music]
the shoulders are crazy
[Applause]
[Music]
so for ever whoever's watching this and
you're looking to do your first prep
have a few things checked off
on your list before you do so one have
some experience not only dieting but
sticking to diets
sticking to long diets and being very
consistent
with that two also if you're training
you can have sporadic training
that also you know falls in line with
your recovery
your sleep all that stuff your lifestyle
you know don't try to prep during big
life changes
if you know you're gonna have a baby
around the same time your
show is you know maybe not a good idea
to prep during that time
uh but yeah i'd say those are pretty big
things to kind of keep in mind before
you
even decide to take that step into the
prep once you have those
you know past experiences and you know
you can kind of stick with those things
uh then maybe you'll be successful
applying yourself to an actual prep
uh i feel pretty good a little tired
only because i got bombarded with the
work
between session one and two so i forgot
to have my
second caffeine fix but besides that uh
fatigue's still very low
um hunger is not an issue energy feels
great um
i'm excited for the rest of the week man
tomorrow oh
it's the best day leg day hack squats
so i might feel a little different after
tomorrow session but uh
here's the open
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh my god
what the is that
