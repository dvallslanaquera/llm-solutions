every single Primal coach you'll ever
interact with that tells you we need to
live like our ancestors do a couple
things in common they all go to the
hospital
when they get sick like I've said this
about a trillion times but if you break
your leg we don't push you next to the
Avatar tree and be like all right nature
do its thing because you just lay there
like ah
like why isn't the tree healing him
because fucking how it works you get
hurt you go to the hospital you get sick
you go to the hospital what does the
hospital have big Pharma medicines
evil corporate doctors and machines upon
machines upon machines that actually
heal you that's all modern that's not
Primal that's a good thing you want to
go to the hospital if you get fucked up
