hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
and i'd like to make a video about
talking you through my recent depending
on when you see this my last as of this
recording bodybuilding transformations
and
that transformation it was after seven
months of off season weight gain and
that off season program has been
described already that's so that would
be episode one so this is episode two
look what the hell am i talking about
check this out so
in december of 2020 i did the npc local
show called the diamond classic
i weighed in at 225.2 pounds which is
just in the heavyweight category
and i had a dexa that week at 6.9
percent body fat and i looked okay i
wasn't very dry didn't do the water
stuff well enough so i was carrying
quite a bit of excess water
and
if i was dry i would wade substantially
less right
then
just so after seven months of off season
i did in 22 and uh 2021 up through
december i did a prep for the masters
usas which i did
and i took second place in the supers
which was really cool
i weighed in at
225.6 i had a dexa that week at 5.8
percent body fat and i looked way way
drier much better
so
i probably put on about 10 pounds of
muscle between those two shows
and most of it was in that seven months
of off season right after december 2020
all the way to about oh
august or july august of um
2021 but some of the muscle when cool
transformation was achieved in the show
prep diet itself so let's take a look at
the diet and training of what i did to
get in shape for that show
so it was a 17 week hypocaloric on
average diet
and the calorie average for the diet was
about 3 000 calories per day and in the
macro average and i'll show you a
typical day that's going to look a
little bit different than this the macro
average was 275 grams of protein per day
360 grams of carbs per day and about 50
grams of fats per day
i did just under 12 000 steps walking on
average every day and i did brazilian
jiu jitsu two to four times per week of
course what about the weight training on
top of that there's my training you can
see it right here you can pause it and
take a look but basically it's
legs
on tuesday and then tuesday's bicep
steps and forms p.m wednesday is chest
and triceps just in the am thursday is
another leg session and then in the pm
more shoulders and biceps and forums
because those muscles recover pretty
fast friday is back again so every
muscle is more or less trained twice a
week unless you are dealt in biceps and
forms then you are trained three times a
week because on that saturday after
triceps for the second time a week it's
the third time a week for delts biceps
and forums so very straightforward
training and if you want to know more
about two a day training revive stronger
steve hall has an interview with myself
charlie and jared talking about two days
on his channel so it's really good stuff
in any case that was my training
typical meal plan a lot of folks curious
about this so here's typical meal plan
you can pause at any time to look at it
in detail but basically i'd wake up at
around 8 in the morning and i would have
a casein shake or casein pudding which
was basically almost entirely protein
the macros are listed below everything
and then i would work like do my uh rp
work to you know earn a living etc then
at roughly 11 o'clock in the morning i
would train and i would just have water
with like a mio squirt calorie free
shake in it i didn't have any sort of
calories on top of that and then at 1 pm
after training typically two hours later
or two hours after began training i
would finish it and have my first meal
and then go to work my first whole food
meal would be usually trifecta chicken
breast white rice broccoli slaw salt
pepper some combination which was about
50 grams of protein 170 grams of carbs
plenty of rice and about 6 grams of fat
and that similar meal would be repeated
with a few less carbohydrates at 5 pm
when i would re-up on food and then
continue to work as you can tell i work
most of the day and then at about 8 pm i
retire from work for the day and then i
have another meal this time trifecta
hamburger a bit more fat uh fewer carbs
than the first meal same as the
second meal a second whole food meal and
then i would just do watch tv and relax
with my wife crystal which was really
fun and then at 11 p.m close to the end
of the finished tv at about 10 do all
the night things to get ready for
bedtime and then at 11 just before i go
to bed i would have egg white wraps with
casein pudding in them it's not a very
good taste but i was starving death at
this point and they have mostly protein
very little carbs and fats so that's
typical meal plan
and the daily totals for that kind of
day and which was similar to the other
days 280 grams of protein 433 grams of
carbs you think wait a minute you said
360 grams of carbs but hold on it's 28
fats right so it's even lower than 3000
calories that was
2816 calories so i would do those kinds
of days if i wanted to push the fat loss
a little bit further
pushing fat loss further sometimes tends
to fatigue it causes potentially a lot
of diet fatigue and then if the diet
fatigue was like rather extreme what i
would do is take a few days of roughly 3
500 calories
per day
uh for a few days straight until the
diet fatigue reduced and it worked
really well my maintenance was oh
anywhere between 37.50 to 4 000. this is
pretty close to maintenance not quite
there but calories were all similar
bodybuilding food so i get to eat a lot
my hunger abated and
i mostly pulled these days off
especially towards the end of the diet
when i would be at a very very high
level of diet fatigue and the way i
cataloged that was if i had two nights
in a row of waking up so hungry in the
middle of the night that i can't go back
to sleep i'd say okay it's time to pull
back um it didn't happen a ton of times
but it happened enough times to where i
had to use this strategy right
steps how do i get my steps so common
question is okay you said 12k steps but
how do you get them a lot of is walking
around the gym between sets a lot of
times when i'm on a fat loss phase i
don't sit around much between sets it's
not like i'm doing cardio but i'm just
like walking around on my phone walking
around looking at stuff and the steps
add up because the pedometer measures
everything when i would go shopping
every few days i'd park the car really
far walk through the whole parking lot
walk around the store a little bit extra
that adds up tons and tons of steps and
if i'm listening to podcasts or
if i'm on a business call for work in
the house then generally i'm walking
around while doing it if you just
if you could be walking or could not be
walking and you choose to walk by
default you just burn a crap ton of
calories throughout the whole day and
get your all your steps that you need so
that was a very very straightforward way
i'm not going to say easy but
certainly easier than doing tons of
formal cardio and
that worked to get me pretty damn
shredded
but of course there are other things in
the mix
in an alternate universe
of course someone who is not me would do
something like what you see right here
on your screen
and i'm drug free 100 lifetime drug free
and i would never do anything like that
so clearly this is not something i did
but i want you guys to see it because it
is a representation of what uh may have
actually occurred in an alternate
universe i can't make any more clear so
i'll just shut the fuck up anyway
that was how i did my entire diet and
that got me ultra fucking lean strider
glutes the whole thing
but it's not enough because to present
well in a bodybuilding stage you have to
pull off the peak properly
next video that we'll have next week for
you guys is how i did my peak week
so i'll see you then
