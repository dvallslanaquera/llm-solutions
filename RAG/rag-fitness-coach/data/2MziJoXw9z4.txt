hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and today is video two of
the probably 12 part series on how to
construct your muscle growth training
plan your hypertrophy training plan and
we are going to be doing it uh
describing how to do it in theory and in
concept and I'm actually going to be
demoing how to do it right here with the
RP hypertrophy training app if you are
watching this video before May mid-may
2023 then hit the link in the
description and sign up for the open
paid beta if you do the link to sign up
before we release you get into the
pre-sale funnel and all your money goes
into my bank account no no wait I wasn't
supposed to tell you that uh you get all
kinds of free goodies which are straight
up totally true and you also get a
really cool super low price to start the
app with so there's that and if you're
excited get into that link and I
straight up build all of my programs
with the RPI virtual app now because I
only train with the app because it's
beautiful and amazing and I help build
it so all good things and look you don't
have to buy the fucking app I'll always
say that uh you I think it's a really
great idea then it's very affordable and
will save you an unbelievable amount of
time but if you want to go your own way
no worries because this video is not
just an app promo video it is a video
that will tell you how to in this case
select your exercises if you want to go
back a video last week we put out a
video about how to design your beginning
of your program and choose where to put
muscle groups and how many days a week
to train so to the exercises let's talk
about how to choose exercises there are
a few rules
I'd say five in how to choose your
exercises five rules about how to choose
your exercise
first you want to think about what
exercises give you the best sfrs
stimulus to fatigue ratios that's super
fancy science talk for exercises that
whatever the target muscle is let's say
it's the chest exercises that give your
chest a ton of tension through the chest
as you do them versus like I don't know
I don't really feel my chest a ton a ton
of burn especially at higher reps like
torching your shit
huge pumps from not so many sets always
a good sign your target muscle feels
exhausted as shit versus like man I
don't know I can keep going this
exercise seemingly does nothing to me
and also gets you plenty or as much as
you're genetically capable of in that
regard of delayed onset muscle soreness
or just muscle soreness after the
training like if you are if a leg press
for your legs gives you crazy tension
burn pump exhaust the crap out of your
quads and your quads get sore for a few
days after gee it's kind of a winner
it's not that's the stimulus side the
fatigue side is it doesn't beat up your
joints a ton and every single exercise
you can do for every single muscle can
be ranked somewhere on how much it beats
up your joints all the way from super
low I can't even tell to like if I do
this I will just get joint cancer and
I'll never recover and I'll never have
joints again
technically you want to pick the ones
that are nice on your joints you want
the exercise also to not dump a ton of
psychological fatigue onto you
psychological fatigue can come from
having to try really hard which is a
part of training but if you needlessly
have to try hard to get the same
stimulus you're better off at an
exercise when you don't have to go
psychotic but you get a great stimulus
anyway and also a part of psychological
fatigue and really a big part is how fun
and enjoyable the exercise is so if you
if you bench press works well for you so
do deficit push-ups but just love
deficit push-ups and that is absolutely
a factor it's a huge Factor but it's a
meaningful factor and has been vetted in
the research actually as being a
predictor of successes if you actually
like the exercise you're doing so that's
number one
number two is you want to choose what
you think you can progress on slowly
progress is critical it's the foundation
of training and if you have muscle
groups in which you pick an exercise for
them and that exercise is like you do it
it's a good workout but then the next
week it's not a great workout and you
stop getting strong pretty fast just
doesn't gel with you but if you know
from past experience though if you start
squatting you just add pounds and pounds
to your squat over weeks and weeks and
weeks that is going to grow a ton of
muscle growth over the long term so I
would pick something like that
third rule is if you're building your
plan maybe for the first time or maybe
for the 10 trillionth time
people will always say
not always people sometimes say often
maybe too often that like you've got to
switch it up man keep the body guessing
your body does not have a logic system
just your brain it doesn't guess it's
much more straightforward than that yes
variation is a good thing so you can
absolutely feel free to mess with some
new exercises but if you have some old
favorites that just fucking work
just pick those you don't have to get
fancy for no fucking reason so if you
tell me hey man I'm thinking of benching
again for my chest to be like okay how's
your stimulus and fatigue ratio you look
amazing and do you think you could
progress on the bench like dude I always
progress on bench we're like okay this
is a totally fine exercise and you'd be
like well should I like try dumbbell
like yeah that's cool too like I figured
I'd giving me any answers like no I
really am and I'll get to Point number
five in a sec to tile This Together
spoil that surprise but it really is
totally cool to do old exercises and new
as long as they check the prior boxes so
for example we can go right here
and go to chest on day one and ooh
camber bar bench press how yes that
checks the boxes for me and then for
bake we can choose
assisted pull up fuck that barbell bent
over row hardcore
all right Rule Number Four
if we do not have an exercise in here
and actually I have to get back to one
of my marketing Associates to tell him
how many exercises we have total in our
library it's a lot
hundreds but we don't have all of them
so if there's an exercise that you do
not see in our list like dude where one
arm reach back pull around face pulls
for your uh orbicularis Ani muscle
Google that uh not a work uh unless
you're an anatomist and then Google it
at work
if we don't have a certain muscle group
what you can do is go up to the menu
and you can create a custom exercise
and why should I do this right now
wait wait wait backspace
dildo
press
exercise type
ooh these menu options we got machine
barbell Smith machine dumbbell cable
free motion body weight only body weight
loadable and machine assistance I don't
like to do anything dildo related if a
machine isn't helping me so I say
machine assistance YouTube vid ID
these developers are fucking brilliant
www.xnxx.com
[Music]
how do you like that man
shit YouTube do not please fucking don't
cancel us don't go to that website it's
full of bad things and uh the muscle
group
ostensibly you have to pick from this
list uh you know we'll say it's for uh
well it's a press right triceps dildo
press boom
I'm not gonna save it because that's
fucking ridiculous but if you save it it
pops up in the menu under triceps
I'm not gonna pollute Scott Scott should
I save it so you have dildo press sure
I'll show you forever I'll think of you
hey exercise created you can create
another or you can just say okay I've
had enough fun and then let's see if the
system works this could be embarrassing
potentially we go to the triceps
this Apple computer dildo press
it's there of course we're fucking
picking it I like that it's also all
caps I guess your caps lock is on and
I'm an idiot there we go it's off
uh yeah so anyway you can make your own
exercise
now here's the thing
especially if you help link in a video
for us so we can check it out every key
whiz I don't want to make promises
promises like my dad did when he said
I'll be back in later this afternoon I
haven't seen in 15 years just kidding I
see my dad all the time
every
half a year or so
at least for the first little while
probably regularly after that
myself and the Jared for their ifb Pro
and the Scott the video guy we are going
to travel to one of America's best
equipped gyms there's a couple gyms on
our list
and we are going to video probably a
person that looks more appealing than we
do
demoing
all of the exercises you guys picked
that are the highest across occurrence
so if like 80 000 of you active monthly
users make me a trillionaire and you all
pick dildo press we will have a dildo
press in the actual shit now I said
Scott's video I'm making a big mistake
right because you motherfuckers are
going and there are 18 000 people are
going to recommend dildo press bucket
Bring It On we can always ignore it no
wait I should I should be telling
somebody else not you guys on a serious
note
just throw in the exercises
that you want to see and if you do that
and other people do that then eventually
we will just have all the exercises that
you want to see in there
if we don't throw your exercise in there
it's probably because you were one of
the only people to select it or just not
that many people selected it and we have
to prioritize on what most people want
but you can just always have your custom
movements and your app remembers that so
you can only select them and they're
just the same and even if you throw your
own video link in there then you can
have the pop-up video show up and you
can remember what the Hella dildo press
even was
all right so that's that
Point number five that was point four so
point four was if you don't have an
exercise feel free to fill your room
0.5
in program design
and in choosing exercises
really really there are no wrong answers
they just aren't
most exercises are great
done properly with good technique which
we'll get to later
they give you great results
and
feel free
to play with our autofill feature if you
just don't know what exercises to use
what do I mean by that let's say you're
like man I just fucking don't know what
exercises to use or you're a nice person
or you don't swear like me and you're
like a mom of three and you want to work
out and get in shape sorry for all the
swearing but you're like I I want to use
this hypertrophy thing I think that RP
knows what it's doing but like I don't
know about selecting my own exercises
like I just I don't have you know I look
at the menu and it's just kind of
overwhelming watch this
we have an autofill feature top right
hand corner
we click on autofill exercises
and look at that it conserved the ones
we already picked and then it inserted
autofilled exercise
into the situation
over time
we are going to be advancing the
algorithm that determines which
exercises get filled
for now the feature is mostly like a
random suggestion feature just to keep
you creative
over time it will evolve and we've
already written the pseudocode for this
by the way for you nerdy fucks
over time it will evolve into a feature
that tracks what works best for you
based on how you rate your responses in
the app we'll get to that in a future
video
and it will more than likely surface
exercises that have the highest stimulus
to fatigue ratio as far as the app can
tell based on what you actually need
as far as I can tell
and 2023 this is the only app that does
a bunch of this actually but uh this is
the only app that does this learns how
you respond through Modern periodization
through your subject to feedback and
suggest exercises that are probably
better for you based on your experience
so
hit the description click on things
sign up for the Beta release
or if it's after mid-may 2023 just buy
the fucking thing
have fun making your mesocycle next time
in the next video let's see what we have
to cover we are going to talk about how
to once we choose our exercises and our
program gets created How We Do warm-ups
and load selection
but before we get to that one little
bonus feature for you guys
top right hand corner create mesocycle
now you notice this app is already kind
of smart if you just go to I think this
is possible select exercise no it's not
all right I'll demo this another way we
add a muscle group and we say quads fuck
it why not I'm trying to get my legs
full notice that create muscle cycle is
now grayed out that's because it won't
let you continue to creating a meso
until you pick all of your exercises
because you can't train with no
exercises so now that we trash can this
one or if we filled it in with something
now we can create Mezza when we create
the meso
we get an opportunity to name said meso
dildo azo
I might regret this in later videos fuck
it
and it asks us how many weeks we want to
train including deload so four weeks of
training means three weeks of
accumulation one week deload five is
four and one
six is five and one
there aren't any wrong answers here in
later uh in a couple videos uh down
we're actually going to get into the
Nitty Gritty of well technically
speaking there is a way to optimize this
based on your responses but because
we're making this video from the
perspective that you're kind of writing
your first program at least in the app
and maybe your first program ever
we're gonna say let's just pick the safe
bet and go for
total weeks three up one down it's the
month easy no problem what units do you
use for measurement uh we could use
kilograms if we were in the countries of
Europe but because we earned the Infidel
America will choose pounds and we hit
create
and things happen and we are ready in
dildo mezzo week one day one Monday baby
we got bench and we got good stuff and
we got the whole workout we'll talk
about that next time and we'll see you
then
