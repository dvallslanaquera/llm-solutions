is
hey guys so robin and i are gonna take
you through our last week of training
i started a new phase um
based off of the apre which stands for
autoregulatory progressive resistance
exercise
protocol and if you guys aren't familiar
with it below i'll link a study
that was done in 2010 by manitowo and
i'll also link a facebook page
that was written by the strength guys on
this sort of programming which we've
started to incorporate
uh into some of our programs now and
i've been trying it out myself
so essentially what you do and you sort
of miss the first one but
you work up to an estimated in my case
five rep max and that will be based on
how you're feeling that day
and so you you end up
taking that estimated five rep max to an
rpe of 10
so concentric failure and that's why
i've got my spotter on hand here
so what i ended up getting with i think
it's 315
was let's say six and a half reps maybe
seven
reps and so because i
got two reps above my
five rep requirement i added
ten pounds so i went up to 325 and then
i took that to failure
so it's basically two all-out sets to
failure
with your predicted five rep max
and if you just [ __ ] the bet on that day
and you only get it for three
then you would adjust your final set
based on that performance
and you would reduce the weight
accordingly
so it's a little bit of a different
protocol but the the good thing about
the auto regulatory system is that
you can you can choose your load based
on
your actual max that day since
a one rep max is sort of a moving target
rather than something that's static over
time
so then after those sets i moved into
three stop eccentric bench presses
which you can see me doing here and the
main purpose behind this is just to get
a little bit of extra volume that you
sort of miss out on with the apre
protocol and also to
help me control the eccentric a little
bit better and
stay tight especially off the chest
which is something that
i've been struggling with a little bit
lately and sort of always had
yep and then
i did sumo deadlifts so
these to be honest were supposed to be
control or like speed i guess technique
deadlifts
but i haven't been training as
frequently as my program
um demands simply because i've been
like working so much 35 40 hours a week
waitressing and it's
really hard on the body so i can't train
as often as i'd like to so when i do
train i
i want i wanted to go a little bit
heavier so
um yes 200 by five by three which is a
huge
and so this is actually another day here
so
i do my apre bench one day then i take a
rest day
aka a biceps day and then i come in and
do
my apre squats and there's been a bit of
a learning curve for me with this it's
been a while since i've taken sets of
squats to complete failure
and it's quite difficult to do
especially i've still got that nagging
injury
and it sort of reminds me of the old max
ot style of training where you kind of
take a couple
high-intensity all-out sets to failure
and if if nothing else this certainly is
has helped me mentally learn to to sort
of push myself and
learn what it really means to take a set
to an rpe of 10
again and we're thinking that that um
it's likely i guess a disc or like a
spinal injury because
it's been like eight months
and it's not letting up at all it's the
same
pain so yeah it's probably something a
little more permanent than
like a muscle unfortunately
i was quite pleased with these squats
though you can see from the angle there
that
that looks pretty consistent throughout
the exercise
i i think through the set um
i think that because of my injury my
squats have
started to deteriorate a little bit i do
good morning a little bit more than i
used to and a part of that also i think
has to do with the fact that
i've been playing around with a new
stance if you've seen me squat in
competition before you sort of notice
that i take a pretty narrow stance
and um kind of just go straight up and
down
with the bar and i've tried to blow like
low bar high bar squats
yeah and now they're like he's
practicing like
a more of a low bar uh technique with
the
wider stance to limit depth but it's
just not great just doesn't seem to be
audrey here like he has short femurs so
he doesn't really
need to do that technique i don't mind
yeah i have super
short femurs and i have really strong
quads so taking this closer
stance yeah actually
just feels a lot more comfortable for me
and it's always worked for me
uh so i'm thinking about making a switch
back to there just because i just
not really particularly fond of the are
those
deadlifts uh these are actually yeah
these are
doug miller deadlifts so i i just
bounced the bar off of the ground
um but i did reset a couple reps because
i was starting to lose my grip
but yeah i i think that reset deadlifts
should be the main focus of any
program wasn't there that one study that
was like 95
of your max you you should be able to
bounce deadlift that five
five times or something so it's like
clearly not what you should do in
practice like if you're
a power lifter or you're training for
strength because like
it's just completely unrepresentative
and this
the consecutive reps after the first are
not
deadlifts no they're not deadlifts it is
essentially a different exercise but
um i want to put them in there just so i
can get a little bit more frequency out
of my dead lifting and it not be so
taxing so you can do
five reps with a touch and go that you
wouldn't be able to do that
that wouldn't have the central fatigue
that you'd get from resetting every reps
i was going to say it's a lot easier on
your cns
so um these are so called
extensions um i'm doing these for glutes
and hamstrings and brett contreras put
out an excellent video if you check out
his channel
pretty much you're not following his
advice there how soft
look at yours look at your uh lower back
it was
it was an extension instead of flexion
like right
yeah i i know i hadn't seen that video
and these are the these are swiss ball
triple threats
they're hard they look easy but they're
very very difficult
and they leave you not being able to
walk yeah
um these were actually a staple of my
hamstring training all throughout
my last off season and basically what
you do is you do a leg curl
and then you do a glute bridge which i'm
doing a
bastardized form here and then
um or sorry then you do a hip thrust and
then
a uh a glute bridge or whatever like a
straight leg hip extension and then now
a bent like
a bridge yeah on the swiss ball and it's
pretty hard on your
core too it is yeah it's a tough it's a
good exercise i really like it so you do
ten reps of each movement and then do
that for three or four sets
and you'll feel your hamstrings i
guarantee you
yeah so this is yet another day
so i'm bench pressing uh
295 for four eighty percent i think on
this day i did something like
uh 14 working sets of
bench uh and worked up to 92 and a half
percent
so here i'm doing 335
for three singles and you can see the
bar is just moving up pretty easily
and i'm really pleased with that because
my best bench
in meat uh was 336
so just one pound over what i'm putting
up here pretty easily
by the arnold i'm hoping to be able to
put up 385
and this is 335 for a pretty easy double
good pauses
and then i dropped back down to 315 for
two
and bench felt really good on this day i
felt like i was able to stay tight
especially on the chest
our path was good so these are strip
sets and they're touch and go
and they were hard because it was yeah
the bench is what suffered the most
through the like my
my job because i use my upper body so
much at work
and um anyway yeah so but i was pretty
happy with these
um i have gotten 115 for a really easy
pause double before but like
the volume sets on these um 110
for touch and go double and then strip
down to 80
pounds for five and then i think on my
last set i
actually did do 115
for a double and then um
then straight down to 80 again but yes
it was very difficult still really happy
i
think it was like four or five sets in
total
i'm not like i'm being lazy with my
technique as you can probably tell
they're touch and go
so yeah i let it kind of the eccentric
wasn't super controlled but
um i was using that dairy chest now it's
that urge though
yes and i use my arch i don't ever not
use my arch i think that's the 115.
oh that was a struggle
i don't like i like to bench without a
spot because then
i'm forced to get it up get the wheel
out so i'll do it when jeff's not
looking because otherwise he'll like
come over and try to spot me
safety first
so this is still that same workout i
finish off that workout with some
full range of motion wide grip pull-ups
for
four sets of eight repping is the nova
nutrition shirt yeah
bought courtesy of robin yeah it was a
birthday gift p-day
one of his b-day gifts and then after
this i didn't film it but i go and do
some reverse grip
lat pull-downs again another emphasis on
full range of motion
just got to keep that back workout or
that back work in there
uh i still have bodybuilding aspirations
so i do
keep those movements again you look at
you
you're good so this is my second
deadlifting session
of the week and you'll see that i i'm
resetting every rep here
so this was 70 and i just did a simple
5x5
uh so with 405 and then this is just
another angle i won't put all the five
five sets i think i'm wearing straps
here which is
maybe part of the reason why the form
looks so fluid um
but my grip was starting to fail because
i just haven't been dead lifting with
any significant amount of weight
so i noticed my grip strength kind of
sucks but you should come back quickly
yeah i on the other hand never use
anything
ever i don't think i've ever used wrist
straps or straps or whatever
so you remember this day this was a
really really hard day because i
deadlifted
and then i went and did five sets of
eight on squats
uh i started with 3 15 and it actually
felt pretty easy and then rob was like
that was too easy that was like rpe
seven
oh loud okay here we go and i put on 355
and did that for
a bunch of sets of eight and it just was
pretty brutal to be honest especially
after the deadlifting
yeah i mean i that's a thing like jeff
wrote this program and like you gotta
actually like do the program to know
what it's like
it's almost like hard to do it like it's
hard to
like his rp on the first set was low but
i mean like
after all the volume deadlifts it's like
you either have to cut back the rpe
or cut back the sets because the rpe
changes throughout the course of five
sets
right so and you're so exhausted already
that you interpret a lower rpe as being
true
harder and quieter yeah because like
you're just so
exhausted but like your speed wasn't
like indicative no i know i agree
like that the actual rpg yeah i agree
yeah
overall i was pretty pleased with this
day this was one of those days that
i sort of just had to like and that's
still your wide stance i think
it's not so good like something they
actually do look
they look good decent it's just like
it's yeah
nothing's gonna feel great right now
with your yeah
so i'm torn between whether i would be
more comfortable switching back to the
close straight up and down stance that i
used
previously or if i should stick with
this one um
what i don't like about this one is the
tightness
though like i don't know but it was the
other sets that
yeah the next week that they were kind
of oh my friends squats
these these were the prs for me so i did
90 by eight
which is pretty crazy in my opinion
and then 85 by eight for three more sets
and
they were really hard my quads are and
glutes are so sore
after this workout i previously only
ever
had like i think it was like a 10
on the bar or something on each side for
front squats so i
really really brought my weight up like
by 30 pounds
in for eight years i was doing like 55
or 60 pounds for eight before
just like these couple last couple
programs and then this is just
like volume bench wow it looks so
pretty
just don't look at my face
i think there's a really brutal one okay
this is my face is covered here but
anyway yeah i'm doing 95
by five um for like five cents i think
just again not
using a spotter for psychological
reasons yes i guess
oh i think this next set is the bad one
i don't wanna
i don't want you
it's not bad no my face
okay we're gonna get rid of this you i'm
so
ugly stop that this set is good that's
what is that that's 100 oh yeah 100
pounds by five all right so i guess
i'm allowed to look
less aesthetic your bench looks awesome
though like you can tell they're
grinders no spot you go for a fifth rep
anyway
you're definitely thinking you might
have to just yeah i was thinking i don't
put the
clips on because just in case i have to
dump the butt
um and these are my cossack squats and i
was doing these with
jeff like holding on to jeff like uh
the trx bands except jeff's arms just to
take away resistance because they're
so hard and they're hard on the hips and
like you need to be really flexible and
mobile and
um i'm so glad that i consistently did
them in my last three
uh strength eyes programs psg programs
that jason wrote me
so here i am finally doing them with
weight i did a set with a three pound
dumbbell as a joke to send to jason
and then with an eight pound dumbbell
first
of all all right guys so that's our
training week
