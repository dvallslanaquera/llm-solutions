hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
beautician I have a quick tip for you
the quick tip is that in the gym when
you are coaching yourself and especially
other people that you are helping with
their Fitness
simple cues work best
here's the deal
if you're coaching yourself or others
it is always tempting for some segment
of us
try to be as advanced as possible with
our queuing and then using exotic
multi-layered cues to try to get the
person to shift into the technique that
we would like to see so something like
you know try to twist your pinkies up
and out when the glenohumeral joint
passes 164 degrees of external rotation
it's like what the fuck and if you
follow some insta people I will not name
them uh that's the kind of advice they
give you're like whoa this person's
really smart and must know what they're
talking about now here is the reality
most exercise moves are actually quite
simple
sport moves are very complex
kicking a soccer ball properly has a ton
of different rotations and join angles
Etc bench pressing a bar squatting
deadlifting
some of the simplest moves you can
describe in biomechanics
and here's the even more important part
humans learn best
when simple instructions are given
you want the instructions you give to
your clients
to allow them to move better you want
them to be understandable
so that they can allow people to move
better
you don't need the instruction to have
the added benefit of making you sound
really smart
because your job is to be a service
provider to them to get them to move
better so they can be fitter and
healthier and all the stuff they pay you
money for they don't really pay you
money for you to sound smart and if
sounding smart came at no additional
expense of conveying information hey
fucking smart it up Doogie Howser
whatever the fuck but if sounding smart
layers in a needless layer of complexity
layers the layer who've said that better
if sounding smart adds a layer of
complexity that obfuscates the actual
goal and interferes to some extent with
efficient effective communication you
are literally trying to sound like a
fucking nerd at the expense of the
benefit to your client don't do that
that doesn't make any sense
before a set that applies after a set
that applies if you're emailing
instructions to your client when you
watch their video on loom or whatever if
you're distance coaching that applies
during the set of course you give a few
cues here and there
during a set people are focused on the
set and they're in pain and they're
exhausted so the cues you give during a
set have to be even simpler
chest up shoulders back elbows up don't
external internal supination the fuck up
out of here what is this an anatomy
class
it's cool nerd shit is cool but if it
interferes with message delivery it's
not a good idea to do
it's just not the best time for people
to process complexity if at all so my
recommendation is to use the simplest
cues that work
no simpler you don't want cues that are
so simple they're ineffective right what
does that I think uh probably fake
Albert Einstein quote like make
everything you can as simple as it can
be but no simpler right so that is
definitely a thing that applies and only
Elevate the complexity of your
explanation when that is required to
deliver the information within your
explanation if you can deliver the same
amount of information get the person to
understand the same thing and fix the
technique that they need to with the
smallest amount of information if you
just say chest up versus articulate all
of your spinal processes by one degree
each so I'm eating at a 40 degree total
articulation and extension
I mean that actually just said the same
thing
but one of those is just straight up
fucking nerd speak that most people will
not be able to process at least in real
time while they're doing it because you
have to stop repuling particularly each
one Burger
okay got it there's just a chest up it's
the same thing
you don't need to try to sound smart
you don't want to be
a nerd with no friends
trust me
okay I've seen it myself
I'll see you guys next time
