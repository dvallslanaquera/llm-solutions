hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
video number five in our building your
first program series
building your next program after your
first that's right it's a bonus video we
teach you how to build your second
program not just your first so
here we go where are you at in this
point
you've just finished your first
productive metal cycle of training
you did your deload you're fresh and
you're ready to
kill lions with your bare hands those
poor lions won't even see you coming
now it's time for you to use your last
program to
intelligently and effectively design
this next upcoming program
so that you can get all of the great
results you got from the last one
and start to work off of them to get
even better results in the future
pretty straightforward first question
what exercises are you going to be using
the answer is all the same ones unless
you have a good reason to change
there are three good reasons to change
exercises
from one kind of exercise to another
exercise that targets the same or
similar muscle groups
but is just a different way of moving
here are the three reasons
first if you've hit like a strength
plateau and you're no longer getting
stronger on that exercise even though
you're working hard and properly
it's a good idea to maybe change the
exercise so if your squat has sort of
peaked out
try the hack squat or something like
that point number
two reason number two why you would
change the exercise is starting to feel
really stale
you're doing multiple sets and multiple
reps and you don't really get a good
pump
no good connection to your muscle you
don't feel a lot of tension of the
target muscle you just kind of feel
tired
and then uh you know maybe it's time to
switch to an exercise and if it's a
different exercise it'll probably feel
nice and fresh
for quite some time ahead lastly
if the exercise is giving you joint and
connective tissue pain like your knees
are your elbows hurt and
technique alterations can't fix it and
it's getting worse over time the more
you use that exercise
it's probably a good idea to switch out
so if close grip bench is really
starting to hurt your elbows
you try to widen your grip just a little
you tried to flare your elbow as you try
to put the bar lower higher the chest
and your levels still hurting more and
more and more
stop close grip benching change to
something else
if none of those criteria are met the
exercise is
still escalating in strength it's still
feeling good great mind muscle
connection so on and so forth you're
getting great pumps
and if there's no connective tissue
discomfort or pain
just leave it in that means you may do
the same exercises
for years and that's okay because you
learn to do them really well they're
really effective and there's no reason
to change
right um similar idea to
you know every now and again you go out
to a restaurant
and you have your one big favorite meal
that you really like
someone's like hey why don't you order
anything else and you're like well i
really feel like eating this
favorite meal that i always order and if
someone's like why don't you try
something else
the real good question to ask them is
why because if you have something good
and dependable just keep sticking to it
now
if you get to that restaurant you're
like i'm not really feeling this meal
then you order something else but if
you're still feeling like oh my god i
can't wait to eat this awesome burrito i
always order
just go for the burrito you always order
it's the sure thing
so that's exercises once you've changed
or left in the exercises
you have to look at how to restart
weight and rep progressions or
how many reps and weight to do so of
course for new exercises
just warm up and find a hard set of five
to ten and then
follow the progression instructions from
video number three in the series
super straightforward if you're
continuing exercises
you can do a little bit better because
you have some more precise information
you don't need to warm up raw
what you do is you warm up for a set of
three to five reps
with the last hard weeks of training so
if you squat at 135 pounds
for a set of you know some sets of 5 to
10 in that week eight
and then we did week nine you deloaded
now it's week 10 and week one of your
new program
throw 135 on the bar after a few warm-up
sets to get nice and loose
get your technique right and with 135 do
a set of three to five
and that'll be sort of your last heavy
warm-up
and then do 135 or so
probably just 135 that weight that you
did last time
and try to hit a set of five to 10 reps
if you overshoot 10 reps and it's still
not hard
next time just use more load as video
number three but instruct
and if you hit between five and ten reps
and it's challenging maybe last time in
week eight you hit
135 for a set of six and this time you
hit a first set of seven or eight and
it's nice and challenging stop
and then boom you have your load that
you're using and the next week you can
progress
and the progress video is video number
three go back and look at that same
process a lot of the stuff is really
just the same process
as your first mesocycle you just put it
right into the second
what about restarting sets this is some
a concept that gets a little bit
different a lot of people would say okay
did five sets of everything or on
average five sets per exercise
in you know the last week of my last
mesocycle before de-learning
i'll just do five now the thing is
d-loading has re-sensitized you to
growth so much and desensitized you to
take damage from those exercises so much
that if you do five sets you're gonna
get crushed with soreness and fatigue
you're just not ready for that sort of
thing
d-loading detrains you a little bit so
what you should do is fewer
how do you know how few well here's what
you do you just start with one set
and after you've done that set in that
very session in that very exercise
you ask yourself did i get a really good
pump and am i pretty fatigued
and if the answer is no to either one of
those you add another set you just do
another set right there and then rest
one or two minutes and do another set
and you ask yourself the same question
do i have a pump and am i fatigued
if one or two either of those questions
gets a yes stop
once you get a good pump stop or
you get up to doing three sets total for
an exercise even if you still haven't
gotten a pump still haven't gotten
fatigued stop
because you can always add sets later
sometimes you don't get a good pump you
don't get really fatigued
but if you do more than three sets you
get so sore that the amount of damage
you're incurring
counterbalances how much your body can
actually grow muscle
and the damage and growth compete with
each other and you get a whole lot of
not much
and also also really shitty to be like
limping around for a week
so do it most three sets if you never
get pumped
uh or you never get fatigued or fewer
sets if after one or two
or three of the sets you get some
noticeable okay i have a decent pump or
i'm getting pretty tired with this
muscle here stop and then the next week
you start again with those set numbers
and then you add
according to video number three's
progression model for how to add sets
that's it super straightforward when
you're doing this you're gonna be adding
load and reps just like video number
three instructed
you're gonna be adding sets just like
video number three instructed
and you just follow that same
progression for this new
message cycle that you're doing it's
literally the same
and it's that simple those several
formulas of how to add reps how to add
load
how to add sets really three very easy
formulas
will take you the rest of the way
through the rest of that mesocycle until
you have to take a d-load same
thing when you take a d-load it's the
same process
and then you just restart that again and
do your next mesocycle
it's that easy the cool thing is people
can comfortably do this kind of really
simple training
and get excellent results for two or
three or more years
for sure and if they're really loving
the training and they feel like they can
tolerate more and they want even better
results they can potentially add a day
of training in
so it's two to four days of training as
they're recommended for beginners
if you started with two days of training
and after a few months you're like man i
can do more
add a third one never add two at a time
just one if you started with three you
can add a fourth if you started with
four potentially you can add a fifth but
i would just milk four out for years and
years and years because that's as close
as you get to optimal for a really long
time
and then what okay after
multiple years or sorry after your first
mesocycle and then after your second
what do you do then
you can just continue to do simple
training
for multiple years two to four times a
week
and get super fit and super strong you
can get amazing results like if you
don't want to put any more
complexity into your fitness journey
that's awesome
tons of us get a ton of things we don't
put a ton of complexity into i get my
oil changed every now to get my car i
got my engine looked at every now and
again regular checkup
but other than that i'm not like modding
my car i'm not looking for other car
deals i'm not looking to put bigger
tires on it i'm not a car person
you might not be like a workout person
but you want fitness to be a part of
your life
two to four times a week compound heavy
movements progressively over time is all
you'll ever need to be in great shape
and great health period
especially if you take a look at your
diet that's all you really ever need to
be in fundamentally really really good
position
there's no need to complicate anything
and there's no need to make things super
advanced
option two is after a few years
to take your training to the next level
you have to want to do this because it's
going to require
more work it's going to be a little bit
more requiring of diligence and
perseverance and so on and so forth
it's going to elevate your rate of gains
versus if you just
stuck to the simple just a little bit so
that little bit has to be worth it for
you
if you're going to elevate your game
you're going to need to do
probably a little bit more youtube
watching of other channels potentially
including this one
and you might want to get a few books so
let me give you guys some really good
recommendations
as for the channels on youtube to follow
to get a little bit more into that
intermediate realm
more advanced there's tons of videos on
this channel renaissance prioritization
that are targeted exclusively towards
intermediate advanced people as a matter
of fact our average video rp
is targeted towards the intermediate so
just start consuming more rp content
you'll be like oh wow like this is
actually answering a lot of my questions
about how to make things more advanced
other channels that we highly recommend
you take a look at juggernaut training
systems
great stuff for intermediate advanced
folks especially strength oriented stuff
revive stronger steve hall's channel a
great great channel
lots of basics lots of interviews to get
you guys into the mix of more advanced
stuff
jeff nippard's channel excellent
excellent stuff especially for the
intermediate and above
omar isuf has great stuff 3d muscle
journey 3dmj has great stuff
sat strength joey satmar's channel has
amazing stuff
and there are many others one very
notable channel is the stronger by
science channel
but that has usually more advanced
information than intermediate so i would
start with these other channels first
a few months or years after you're
feeling really competent understanding
all the ideas
then you can start to follow and watch
the videos of a channel life stronger by
seconds
as far as books two recommendations
there's many other very good books
but two really do stand out one is the
art and science of lifting
by uh greg knuckles and omar isuf great
beginner books that really introduce you
to all these conceptual ideas
so that when you're making your training
more advanced than just beginner
training you understand the concepts
you're working with
it's not just following instructions it
really just starts to come from within
the stuff really starts to make sense
once you've read those books the next
books to move on to are
the muscle and strength pyramids by eric
helms and andy morgan and i have a
couple of more co-authors that have
contributed
those are awesome books for that next
level so i would actually start with art
and science of lifting first
and then i would move on to the muscle
and strength pyramids later if you want
to learn more stuff a ton of our rp
books come in really handy
the scientific principles of strength
training scientific principles of
hypertrophy training the rp diet book
that's all more advanced stuff a bit
more of advanced audience so once you've
gotten through this basic stuff which by
the way you don't make any money from
this stuff
um you can get into right not that
there's anything wrong with making money
which brings me to my next point
what do you do for continued success
work hard there's never a time in which
this is going to get easy
but there's also never a time in which
it's not going to cause results as soon
as it gets easy
it won't be causing any more results so
never to abandon that always be
dedicated to hard work
always expect it and then good things
will happen point number two
psychologically it's really good for
beginners and everyone above to compare
themselves to their previous best
you know you're the man in the mirror is
is the person you're at war with
not other people or less other people
it's cool to look at other people for
inspiration
but probably not a great thing to
compare because they have different
genetics lifestyle and maybe using
different supplements so on and so forth
so
really really try to compare yourself to
yourself and that way you'll find a lot
of
really rewarding personal growth and of
course size and strength increases
be proud of your accomplishments okay
the first time you squat or bench press
or deadlift like 225 pounds two plates
on the side or even
a plate on a side or something like that
uh did you fucking did it you know
you've come a long way
shake your own hand i don't even know
how you do that like
try to hit the mirror and you have to
hit in the mirror uh do your best and
really be proud of what you're doing
because some people
they look so much at what others are
doing that they can't be proud of
themselves you know you
have maybe squatted 225 pounds two
plates on a side for the first time ever
for a set of five to ten
and then you look at someone else even
in the gym or someone on youtube that
you follow that's doing 315 and the
overhead press for multiple routes you
probably won't see that at a gym
but you know maybe someone's squatting
there you think like how am i supposed
to be proud of myself when there's other
people doing those
incredible things well you might have
been proud of yourself when you
graduated college but a fuck ton of
people have done that
you might have been proud of yourself
when you were super really really nice
to a significant other and you're like
man i do a really good thing like i
helped an old lady across the street
you should be proud of yourself for that
but people help old ladies cross the
street all the time
you don't have to be the greatest
fucking person of all time to cut
yourself some slack and if you never cut
yourself any slack you'd probably just
never be all that happy
and a lot of life is about happiness so
maybe you're missing something there
and lastly i'll come back to the
last thing actually so second to last
enjoy the process
enjoy the process this is all for
entertainment after all and
health and wellness is really important
but this should be fun
and it should be rewarding and once you
get your new superpowers use them for
good maybe occasionally evil but cool
evil not scummy evil
and lastly take all of this education
you've gotten and all this passion and
use it to buy rp things that we sell
god damn it folks i need a ferrari i'm
tired of buying lamborghinis
i'm on my 10th lamborghini i have all 10
of them at the same time they're
different colors different models
i need something new i like that little
horse bouncy logo thing the ferrari has
i want a ferrari and probably not one
the only way i get that kind of money if
you guys click on the website and buy
stuff
buy stuff and enjoy the lifting journey
see you guys next time
you
