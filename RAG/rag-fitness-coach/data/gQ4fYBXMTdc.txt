hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization
today's BS topic is asking a question
really
making a statement that we will
potentially refute
and it is the idea that artificial
sugars artificial sweeteners more
particularly are messing with your
insulin response this is quite a popular
claim and people will save a look I know
artificial sweeteners don't have
calories that's kind of been refuted and
some people will even attest to okay
fine you win that one science
but
I don't consume them personally as a man
of God but also because they spike your
insulin and that's bad
somehow
they never really get to any of the
details about that but don't worry we
will so let's take a look
it is true
there is actually a thing where sweet
taste as detected in the mouth area
signals the secretion of insulin
generally in the body
upon detection of a sweet taste in the
mouth insulin is secreted and that is
actually termed the cephalic insulin
response cephalic forehead
and
it does occur with sugar ingestion
which is sweet
your body detects the presence of sugar
in the mouth and then Begins the insulin
response so that when the sugar gets
through it's got insulin to transport it
into the cells to make them happy and
that's how science works the cells
actually smile under microscope I'm
kidding of course or am I get out your
microscope pinch off some skin
get in there let me know what you find
in the comments below
now in some animals
specifically rats and mice that have
been tested
there can be a cephalic response which
is insulin is secreted upon presentation
to the mouth
with artificial sweeteners so if you
give some kinds of rats and mice
artificial sweeteners they do have an
insulin secretion response from those
which is a trip and it happens
however on the net balance of the
evidence it seems to either rarely
or never happen
with humans with artificial sweeteners
it looks like the best available
evidence shows
as of today
exactly what happens yeah as of right
now
that humans need the actual sugar
molecules themselves to trigger the
cephalic response and that the
artificial sweeteners just don't do it
if artificial sweeteners did trigger a
human cephalic response
you could predictably upon the
presentation of a lot of artificial
sweetener potentially cause a
hypoglycemic episode
but I have actually never seen anyone or
seen anyone report the induction of
hypoglycemia which is when the insulin
gets into the bloodstream looks at your
normal blood glucose and goes hey get in
the cells and then your bloodstream is
super low on glucose because all of it's
been pulled into cells and because your
brain
feeds on blood glucose it goes holy crap
and you start getting really sweaty
super hungry for carbs lightheaded
confused potentially can pass out all
sorts of other bad stuff
some of you may have been hypoglycemic
before it doesn't feel that great unless
you get some carbs in front of you then
it actually feels great because it's the
hungriest you've ever been for carbs and
they taste so good when you're
hypoglycemia
that just doesn't seem to happen with
artificial sweeteners I don't know how
many people have ever had a Diet Coke
and they're like holy crap I'm going
hypo it just doesn't seem to happen
corroborating the laboratory observation
that humans just don't seem to have a
cephalic insulin response with
artificial sweeteners
now
the cephalic phase had a few studies and
artificial sweeteners back in the day
show that it occurred so artificial
sweeteners did seem like they may be to
a small extent helping insulin secretion
occur
but then like 10 other studies after and
multiple different uh design
parameters just showed that that really
wasn't a thing so our best available
element so far is it probably doesn't
happen
now if it happens to a small extent
is that bad
well what is wrong with insulin
secretion
I don't know
insulin secretion is a normal part of
response to food
if insulin secretion occurs without a
presentation of caloric food so just
have a Diet Coke and it secretes a
little bit of insulin somehow maybe that
happens
what happens is your blood glucose will
temporarily dip
that will be detected by your body and
another hormone called glucagon will
signal the liver to dump a bunch of
glucose into the blood and re-raise that
blood glucose right now in your body
right very now insulin and glucagon are
both active they're working to
counterbalance each other to keep your
blood glucose stable
so unless you present a super powerful
modulator that really secretes a
crapload of insulin and outruns the
glucon responds temporarily you won't be
hypoglycemic you won't have any symptoms
which is why you don't get hypoglycemic
and don't have symptoms when you consume
artificial sweeteners for almost
everyone so it's just not a thing to
worry about
you may say but hold on a sec even
though we can't feel it isn't it bad to
have insulin spikes every now and again
even if they're really small spikes and
to you I ask why would it be
insulin is not a harmful hormone
if you have insulin spikes chronically
insanely High way out of normal range
all the time because you're eating a
crap load of junk food all the time and
your insulin is always Sky High that but
mostly because of the fat cell growth
from eating that many calories and the
constant presentation of carbohydrates
in the blood can lead to the
dysregulation of insulin pre-diabetes
type 2 diabetes and then bad things but
that's a whole lot of steps and a whole
lot of magnitude effect that ends up
being kind of like
not to strain this analogy too much but
like
trying to throw a paper airplane to the
Moon
theoretically yes maybe if you had
superpowers or something you could do it
but it's just not in the same realm of
any number of magnitudes
so even if there's a small cephalic
insulin response and some people it
would be insane to predict that this
would be a bad thing because insulin is
not a bad thing chronic excessively High
exposure to excessively High insulin
all the time is definitely not good but
we're talking about Years and we're
talking about magnitudes that if you
didn't have carbs coming in with them
would make you pass out on the spot
and that's just not a thing so as far as
insulin Dynamics and artificial
sweeteners I just wouldn't worry about
it certainly for the time being based on
literature and probably ever
so next time someone says but my
insulins just be like
ah JK never punch your intellectual
opponents always be respectful pay your
taxes brush your teeth tell the truth
there I said what's up and see you guys
next time
