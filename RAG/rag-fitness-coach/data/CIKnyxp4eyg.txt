is
hey everyone so today i'm going to do a
video talking about something called the
appeal to nature
and it ties in closely with something
that i've been noticing
quite a bit now for a while and that is
talk of
chemicals and
the avoidance of chemicals simply
because chemicals are bad
and what this fails to realize is that
everything is made up of chemicals
literally everything
and we can't assume that just because
something contains chemicals
that it's a bad thing in fact here's a
list of
all of the chemicals that you would find
in an apple
now some things on this list would be
very easy to pronounce
some things on this list would be very
hard to pronounce some words are longer
than others
but there's no reason to think that any
of these chemicals are harmful
just because they have a fancy name or
because we classify them as chemicals
so this is really sort of just a
category error where we're taking
everything that falls within the
category of chemicals and then
assuming that to have some negative
connotation
there's simply no reason to think this
for example some
some people would think that 137
trimethyl xanthine
would be something you don't want to put
in your body but the lay name for this
is just caffeine
and oftentimes what you'll see on
supplement labels is they'll put the 137
trimethyl xanthine name on there to make
it sound fancy
but then this can also work against them
when people think oh
well that sounds like a chemical and i
don't want that
so this is just something to be aware of
another form that i often see this
take is sort of to do with the whole gmo
controversy
if you're not familiar with it i'd
recommend watching this video
uh which i'll link here uh which was
featured on jimmy kimmel
where he went and he asked people at a
farmers market market
what they thought of gmos and in case
you don't know
gmos or gmo stands for
genetically modified organisms and the
main reason it seems to me anyway why
people don't want
to eat gmos or or our anti-gmo
uh is because there's something
non-natural about it we're
taking something that occurs in nature
and modifying it
ourselves and this is an appeal to
nature and i'll just
put the definition of the appeal to
nature up here somewhere
and it basically just says that you
assume something to be
unsafe or somehow negative
simply because it doesn't occur in
nature or you assume something to be
better
because it does occur in nature and now
if we follow this logic through
it would necessitate that things like
sharks
and cyanide which is found in apple
seeds
um would be perfectly safe and plenty of
uh synthesized things in in labs which
have
a ton of safety data associated with
them and we know
are safe uh in certain amounts like
sucralose or other sweeteners aspartame
um are assumed to be bad just because
they're synthesized
and this isn't something that is
necessarily true
now i would like to say that often
people who are
quick and this is becoming more and more
popular people are
becoming more and more quick to jump on
the logical fallacy
bandwagon so someone will
make a statement and then people will
say ah that's an appeal to nature or
that's the naturalistic fallacy or ad
hominem fallacy
and they won't even engage with what it
was that the person actually said
so in this case someone will say well i
don't want to put gmos in my body
because i don't want
to eat that it's not natural and you'll
say oh well naturalistic fallacy
you're wrong i'm right kind of thing
just to win the argument but
i think that on the face of it all else
being equal
i think it would be wise to be a little
bit more
wary of something that is synthetically
produced than something that has been
working for us for tens of thousands of
years
like eating apples we know that that's
safe as found in nature
when we take that and we start modifying
genes i think there's nothing irrational
about being a little bit more wary of
that process
but it's not necessarily something
that's negative if we take the modified
food product genetically modified food
product
test it and show it to be safe there's
no more reason to conclude
that it is unsafe because it's been
modified
then it would be unreasonable to assume
that it was unsafe to begin with
um and this has to do with the fact that
there are two types of logical fallacies
there are
formal logical fallacies uh which are
just always wrong and then there are
informal logical fallacies
that can be wrong depending on the
context in the situation
so the appeal to authority is one that's
often used
and you say oh well phil heath doesn't
do if it fits your macros so therefore
if it fits your macros
doesn't work or isn't optimal and then
the person who does if it fits your
macro says oh that's an appeal to
authority or wrong
in this case it would sort of be right
but you would have to show that phil
heath
isn't an actual legitimate expert on the
topic
conversely if you go to your doctor and
he says you have
such and such a condition and he gives
you a diagnosis
you wouldn't say oh you're appealing to
authority in this case he is actually a
genuine authority on that topic
and so to tell you something or to make
some sort of statement
speaking from authority wouldn't
actually be a fallacy in that case
and so it goes with the appeal to nature
while i think that people do
appeal to nature in the case of gmos
it's also important to recognize i think
that
it's okay to be wary of things that
aren't natural and um
it's not necessarily uh wrong to be
skeptical of this
so uh yeah i think that
gmos are safe generally of course
you could genetically modify something
to put
a poison in it or to make it toxic
but generally speaking the gmos that are
on the market
today have been shown to be safe and
there's no reason to avoid them
all right so i guess that's really all i
had to say on that um just wanted to do
a quick video talking about
fallacies in general and how i think
that people are sometimes
starting to just be intellectually lazy
and not actually engage with
the underlying topics so if people say
things like
if it fits your macros doesn't work
because eating donuts all day is bad
you just say oh that's just a straw man
fallacy i don't actually you know say
that eating donuts all day
is bad or it's good
it would be better in this case to
actually engage with it and say
okay so why is it the case that you
think that donuts are bad maybe we
can find some common ground here or
whatever so anyway
