dr mike here for renaissance
periodization building your first
beginner program video number three
please watch the others
this one is on how to progress
first is the starting point we already
covered this
in the first and second videos
after your first week of training
it's critically important to get through
that because then you have a baseline
you've done one challenging set per
exercise
you've written down the weights and reps
that were challenging for that one
working set
now the question we're gonna answer in
this entire
video is what do you do next week
okay and this same question will be
answered very similarly
in most future weeks because it's kind
of a progression formula
you apply it to any one week it designs
the next week of training for you
then you apply it to that next week it
designs the next one and so on and so
forth
this way you get great training tailored
exactly
to your body's needs and responses
someone could for sure just write like a
four week program for you
all at once front end but they don't
know if you're getting stronger or
need more volume or not quite keeping up
so
every single time you write a good
program it has to be updated week after
week after week
all right so we got through that
we're talking about adding weight and
reps over time but a really good
question is
why and there's two fundamental good
reasons why this is
something that's required for optimum
gains first
fact number one is that the best size
and strength increases occur when the
training is
hard okay if you're doing a set and you
stop
let's say 10 reps and you could have
done
five more reps no problem so let's say
you could have done 15 if you had to
anything with five more reps in the tank
is just not very stimulating now still
causes results it'll still for a little
while anyway
cause increases in size and increases in
strength but just not
anything to write home about and you're
just wasting a whole lot of time
so training has to be hard to give the
best adaptations and here's the thing
as you train you get two things stronger
so you can lift more weight and more
muscularly endurance so you can do more
reps with the same weight
and if that thing happens over and over
and over you get stronger you get more
under you get stronger get more
endurance
but you never actually increase the
number of reps or the load on the bar
the weight
then what ends up happening is your
training starts
hard but then session after session
after session degrades
to where it's not hard anymore if you
simply adjusted
usually up increasing the reps or
increasing the weight
every week or so before your sets got
too easy
you could always keep them maximally
stimulative and get all the best results
so in this situation we want
to add weight and or reps to keep the
training hard
so that we're never having workouts
where we look back or like yeah
that was way too easy and it was kind of
a bit of a wasted workout we're going to
be a little bit more proactive
to make sure that every workout is nice
and tough but not so proactive
that we get carried away and we can't
complete these workouts anymore
all right convinced fine adding weight
and reps is a good idea
but the next question is when is it a
good idea to add weight and or reps
okay so we there is a rule
for when you can add weight okay you can
add weight to the last week's exercise
if you got more than five reps last week
okay so if your challenging set had to
end at four reps and you had to rack the
weight
do not add weight just add reps because
the 5 to 10 range is where we want to be
so if you got more than five reps last
week and your technique was
never compromised at that number of reps
when the reps got hard if your technique
was compromised
and you still add weight what do you
think is going to happen next week
it's going to be even more challenging
the technique is going to get even worse
and then you just be doing a whole lot
of nothing
you start with very full deep squats and
then towards the end of the month
because you keep adding weight for no
damn reason even though your technique
isn't stable
you're doing these weird half squats and
grinding and your knees are coming in
and someone's like why are you using
that much weight you're like progressive
overload
but you didn't even do the technique
right if you do the technique
right and you never really falter
and you do more than five repetitions
you can add weight you have earned the
right to add weight
but if your technique still sucks guess
what you're going to repeat that same
weight next week
for the same number of reps and
demonstrate excellent technique
for every single rep and if you do that
then the week after you can add
some weight to the bar so you have to
earn those weight additions
similar thing with the reps you can add
reps
to last week's effort let's say you did
95 pounds for 9 last week
you can do it for 10 this time if two
things occur
first you got between five and nine reps
last week
okay technically speaking under five
reps is fine too but you shouldn't be
getting under five reps if you've got
four reps definitely adding a rep is
totally fine
you shouldn't have gotten four should
have gotten at least five or change the
load right there and then
but if you got nine reps last week you
can add a rep and go to 10
but generally speaking uh you know if
you got 10 reps
you're not going to add a rep because
that takes you out of rep range then you
go to 11. so if you get between five and
nine you can add a rep if you get ten
then it's time to add load right and of
course
just the same as with weight your
technique was never compromised
okay so if you got eight reps last week
i need to add rep but
rep number eight was like iffy and rep
number nine that you tried the technique
was really off so you didn't even count
it
just do eight again and then if you do
eight next week with the same load
and your technique is really spot on the
week after that you can add
one or two reps after right so if you do
more than 10 reps and your technique is
solid like
10 reps or more then for sure add weight
next week
if you get between 5 and 9 reps and your
technique is solid
you can add weight or reps or both
and if your technique breaks down and
this is super important if your
technique
breaks down in the 5 to 10 rep range do
not add weight
or reps for next week you just shoot to
match the same set you got last time
with
matt technique and the next time you
come in next week
you match that same load and same
repetition number
but with good technique and if you can
do that good technique then next week
you can use that same formula to add
reps and or weight so on and so forth
now of course we have to answer the
important question of
how much weight do we add if we're
adding weight and how many reps do we
add if we're adding reps
air on the side of less is a good idea
because you can always do more later and
if you do too much it causes a lot of
fatigue
it causes some injuries with technique
nothing you want so err on the side of
less but don't be too shy
generally speaking for beginners adding
if you know if your technique was good
and you feel like you have more ups in
the tank
or an ability to lift more weight then
you can add between roughly two and a
half percent
to five percent to your last week's load
right so which means if you lifted a
hundred pounds
you can comfortably probably lift 105
next week okay
and this is true for almost every
situation for beginners except for
if you're doing 10 reps and there's
really no difficulty in sight
you should probably add more weight so
for example if you do 100 pounds and
your 10th rep looks like that
you know you don't go to up to 105
because that's just going to be super
easy also
maybe you can go up to 110 or 115. be
easy but add a little more in that
regard
use your best judgment for what will be
nice and challenging in the 5 to 10 rep
range
next question is how many reps to add
usually just one or two
if you're so strong in that movement and
so endurance
that um you probably need more than one
to two reps added to a set to make it
challenging so for example if you did a
five
and you stopped at five and you were
like dude next week i'm gonna be able to
hit at least eight with this level of
difficulty
don't just go to eight wraps don't add
three add some load and maybe some reps
as well so only add one or two reps at a
time and let load make up the other
editions
if you're progressing that quickly
so feel free to pause this and take a
look at this just sample of what's going
on
notice it's not monday wednesday friday
anymore like it was earlier in the last
videos
this sample is just monday monday week
one week two and week three to show you
that progression and of course this work
in almost the same way for wednesday and
friday and so on and so forth so
we notice here that we did a really good
job in week one
and every single one of the working sets
was rated as pretty tough
okay pretty tough is awesome means we
got a great stimulus and
because it was well within our abilities
and our technique was good we can add
load and or reps
and what ends up happening is in monday
of week two
we did add load and reps for every
single one of those lifts
and a few things happened essentially
one of three things happened
one as you can see with that monday week
two squat that first exercise 95 for
nine reps
it is actually pretty easy and if
something's pretty easy next time we add
probably load
and reps and what you can see monday
week three
squat is 105 pounds 10 more pounds
and it's 10 reps one more rep because
when something's pretty easy you add
some load and some reps or a lot of load
the other option it will go down three
exercises to incline bench press 95 for
nine reps on that monday week two
we got 95 pounds for nine reps and oop
that was pretty easy sorry let's go down
to lateral raise
15 pounds for eight reps okay last time
we did lateral raise it was 15 pounds
for six reps it was pretty tough so we
added two reps
and it was pretty tough again change
nothing that's perfect
next week just add a bit of load and a
bit of reps just like normal and as you
can tell in week three
lateral raise gets 15 pounds for 10 reps
pretty tough at eight we go to 10 no big
deal
now there's another option and you can
see it's in bold
hamstring curls we did 60 pounds for
eight reps last time so
week one then in week two we did 60
pounds for nine reps
but our technique was compromised
that nine reps was meh and we're not
going to take full credit for that and
we're certainly not going to add load
and not going to add reps
so then in week three for hamstring
curls you see it's still 60 pounds
still for nine reps but this time we
fixed the technique and it's
rated us pretty tough so that week four
for hamstring curls would probably be
like 65 pounds for nine reps
or maybe uh 60 pounds for 10 reps or
some combination of two
that's how progression works it's really
super straightforward
and it's not that complicated but it can
take a little time to get used to it so
here's a sample
give it a look see what you think now
that's for adding load and for adding
reps to make each set individually
challenging enough
so why would we ever want to add sets
because adding sets is a part of the
progressive process
it turns out that one work set is
usually great for a week or two but in
order to grow the most we have to push
our limits a little bit
there is a way of doing even very hard
sets that if you do so few of them
your body's not receiving as much
strength and muscle growth stimulus as
it could
with just more reps kind of the analogy
here is like
no matter how amazing a piece of food
tastes if you get as
you get to be a better cook whatever
like say making an egg roll your first
egg roll
mass really be a c-plus experience
your third fourth fifth sixth egg roll
that you make you know these are
different times that you're cooking
they're better like you enhance the
recipe a bit the the skin is a little
crispier so on and so forth it starts to
be a tastier tastier egg roll which is
awesome
but if you're hungry one egg roll just
might not do it
and especially if you say gaining mass
and you're getting bigger
and you're getting hungrier because
you're now a larger person
it used to be that you could eat one rag
roll and be totally straight but you
know sometime down the line
it doesn't matter how great that one
roll tastes you want more than one i
mean you
may not want five right at the same time
but maybe you experiment with two
to see if that feels you know the deep
bottomless pit of egg roll desire
in your soul we all have one of those
and if you don't like egg rolls don't
comment don't like just unfollow get the
fuck out of here we don't need you
it's not just un-american for you not to
like egg rolls it's unworldly and
inhuman
but in any case how do you know if
you're not doing enough work
enough sets or if you're doing too much
let's talk about the top end first what
is too many sets
it's actually pretty easy to define it's
if your performance
has not gone up or has even gone down
and you're tired
you know you're you're doing bent rows
and let's say it's three or four sets
each time
next week is hard next week is hard and
then you actually stop getting stronger
and you start to get weaker that
probably means that you're doing too
many steps your body can only recover
from so much
this is still further corroborated by
the fact that you're still sore so if
monday wednesday friday you do some kind
of back movement
and all those days you're still sore on
your back when you're trying to train it
again
not a good sign definitely don't go up
in sets then
but there's a bottom end to where things
are too easy and you probably benefit
from doing more sets
and that really is what happens when
you're just not challenging the body
systems hard enough
for example performance never even
degrades within a session which means
that
you did a set of 10 and it was like wee
and you're done and then let's say you
have two sets that day
you do another set of ten there's still
ten still the same load and you're like
dude i can just keep doing sets of ten
forever
if the volume is challenging if it's
enough sets to really challenge you you
need to feel degraded after
after the actual uh muscle group you've
trained so you've done bent rows
you need to be after you put down the
bar be like oh okay like i'm feeling it
like if you're like i'm totally good i
can just keep going you probably need
more sets as long as the sets are hard
and
even one hard set at the beginning of
your journey can really mess you up
you'll notice that
true beginners when you give them the
first hard set of squats
their legs get wobbly and they're like
holy crap that was tough and you feel
like hey
can you just keep going they're like i
don't know then that's it one set is
good which is why we start with one set
anyway
but if you train three or four or five
weeks one set of squats maybe just be
like oh that was really good
could you do more like yeah no problem
that wasn't really tiring and then more
is probably a good idea
another one is if you barely have a pump
in the target muscle like if you're
really new to lifting and you do a set
of 10 on the curl
you're like holy crap my biceps like
they're like they're like they feel like
they're filled with fluid
cool a few weeks after training one set
isn't going to pump you up that much and
if it gives you almost no pump at all
it's probably time to increase the
number of sets
and this isn't something you can tell in
the session but you can tell between
sessions
if there's zero or very limited soreness
uh or soreness that goes away super
quick then you can probably recover from
more and benefit from more
so if you do your first set of squats
ever and you get sore for two or three
days holy shit like you did something
you don't need any more sets but if
weeks later you do your one set of
squats and you just
don't ever get sore at all not later
that day not the day after nothing
then you can probably get away with
doing more and still benefiting because
clearly your body can recover well from
that
so when to add sets
you definitely just want to stay away
from that very bottom limit of too
easy because it's just not maximally
productive so you add sets if
the exercise uh the sets or set you did
of the exercise never really felt
exhausting never really felt tiring you
felt you could
keep going forever doing more and more
sets you never really got a pump
uh or much of a pump and or the soreness
of that muscle healed well ahead of your
next session so for example if you train
monday wednesday friday
by the time you get to wednesday your
legs should have healed for wednesday
and that's really good
but if your legs never got sore or just
healed monday night and then all of
tuesday spent sitting around being like
i could be training legs right now
because they're healed but i'm doing
nothing
then it may be a good idea to add a set
right
if you're not sure they feel like that
was kind of challenging i don't know
usually the best default is to not add a
cent you can always add one later
over training is probably worse than
under training under training you still
get some benefits over training
everything
starts to go to hell and you have to
deload and all this fatigue stuff we'll
get to that later but it's all just a
big giant mess
if you are pretty sure you need more
sets you're like okay honestly it's not
that challenging
then add but just one set per session
per week
so if you did one set of bent rows three
weeks later you decide to add sets don't
go to three or four
just do two sets of back rows and if
it's again too easy in the next week
then go three then go four then go five
so on and so forth
so here's a sample of when to add sets
so we're doing this kind of uh
sample program here and it's our same
program and you'll notice
it's monday and it's weeks one two and
three
which is pretty straightforward and
week one we just execute the plan
week two we've of course made some rep
and load adjustments but it's still
one set of everything okay and then in
week two
we look at how we're doing and we rate
it on pump
fatigue and soreness so for example
squats
95 pounds for nine reps in week two was
pretty easy and check this out
gave us very little pump very little
intercession fatigue like after squats
were like whatever we could just keep
going
and it created very little soreness from
last week because remember you need to
analyze last week so
that's 95 pounds for seven last week
on monday did not really affect
wednesday and you were already healed so
this time you know almost for sure it's
not gonna affect the next week so you
have to make some changes
so as you can see in week three
because there was a very little bit of a
pump and clearly it was underwhelming
instead of doing one set of squats in
week three
we do two sets of squats we add a whole
different set
at the same load and whatever rep number
gives us a challenge
that's it so we add a set just like that
you'll notice for example for hamstring
curls
in week two never mind our technique are
compromised but we got a good pump
notable intercession fatigue and barely
healed soreness the last week that we
tried this like
last time we did this on monday by
wednesday when we had to train
hamstrings again
we're still kind of you know either
barely healed or a little bit under
healed actually some soreness left
that's why if you look at hamstring
curls in week three it's still just one
set
because clearly that was enough simple
simple formula and you can just keep
using it the entire time you're
progressing
because like look if it wasn't enough
you add a set if it was plenty and
everything's fine don't add a cent it's
really just that simple
so tldr quick summary you want to start
your first week with just
one challenging set write down your
weight in reps
next week you add load and reps in order
to keep the sets challenging
and you want to see how much fatigue
pump and soreness these sets generate
in week 3 plus you of course as usual
add load and erupts to keep this that's
challenging
that's a separate process and you add
sets to the exercises that were clearly
low on fatigue pump and soreness
generation
it just wasn't enough you add a set to
those and for the exercises that were
totally fine and
we're stimulating enough you don't add
anything and you just repeat that same
process all the time
until you're too fatigued to continue
what does it mean to be too fatigued to
continue how can you tell and what do
you do about it
that's for the next video which is all
about taking fatigue
and bringing it down so you can create
the space for another productive run
add progression and get all those great
results you're looking for folks
tune in next week to find out what
that's all like
you
