oh
hey what's up guys so tonight i'm going
to be addressing the common complaint
that you can find a study to prove
anything
so we can't really trust science when it
comes to
laying a foundation for our knowledge
about nutrition
and training and generally i find that
this
protest is espoused in one of two ways
so the first way that we can interpret
this phrase
is to take it to mean you can twist the
results of any study
to make any sort of point that you're
trying to make
and i can't really argue against this
one because sadly this happens all the
time
for example just last week i read an
article
a newspaper article online that said
landmark research shows that sperm and
eggs
appear to carry genetic memories of
events
well before conception and this may
reforce
or force a rethink of the evolutionary
theories of charles darwin
now to me it was obvious when i read
this subtitle that the use of the term
landmark to describe a mere review
article
and the reference to darwin's
evolutionary theories
sort of indicated that this is just
another example of a media spokesperson
failing to effectively communicate
science
with a lay audience
but notice that this isn't really a
problem
with the scientific research itself it's
simply a problem with the reporting of
that research
so in this case i would say that while
it is
true that you can make a study sort of
sound like whatever it is you want it to
sound like
this doesn't make the findings of that
study any less true
and it doesn't make your reportings or
your misreporting
of that study any more true it simply
shows that we presently have a science
communication
problem that arises when we have
reporters and bloggers speaking out on
scientific topics
with no real fundamental fundamental
understanding
of the scientific enterprise let alone
the topic
on which they're presenting and although
this is a very real problem
we're lucky that we do have very
talented general science communicators
letting their voices be heard like neil
degrasse tyson and steven novella
and then within the nutrition and
exercise science community
we have science communicators like alan
aragon and brad schoenfeld
who are doing cutting edge research
right now but are also succeeding in
relaying that information to a lay
audience
and my present advice would basically be
that without any formal scientific
training
your best way to overcome this problem
is probably just to be
wary of very provocative news headlines
and just be skeptical of popular media
sources presenting scientific
information okay so a second way and
what i think is the most common way to
interpret this phrase is to take it to
mean
different studies just give different
results
and there's so much conflicting evidence
out there that it's hard to know
which studies to take seriously or which
ones to believe for example
we'll read one study and it'll say that
having six meals a day
is better than having three meals a day
when it comes to fat loss
and then we'll read another study that
says it doesn't matter how often you eat
per day
as long as you're in an energy deficit
then you're going to lose weight
but it's important to realize that just
because different studies give
different results this doesn't actually
pose any threat to the scientific
enterprise as a whole and this becomes
obvious once you recognize
that there's a hierarchy of evidence
within the scientific community
so let's say for example that we have
one study that shows us that eating six
meals a day is better
and then we have another study that says
it doesn't matter how many meals you eat
per day
which study are we supposed to believe
well this is where we have to look to
the scientific
hierarchy of evidence or the hierarchy
of scientific evidence
now i'm not going to get into the
details of each level of this pyramid
i'll just suffice it to say that at the
top of the pyramid
you have the more reliable studies they
constitute stronger scientific evidence
they're of high quality of evidence and
they have the lowest risk of bias
so let's take a look at this opinion
piece article that i found online
it basically says snacking or grazing or
eating a bunch of meals a day
is better for fat loss and for putting
on muscle
and then it references a study by
bernadotte
al which i'll put a link to in the
description box below
so let's take a quick look back at the
pyramid again
the opinion piece would fall all the way
down there at the bottom
and the actual article the study
referenced would fall
probably under randomized controlled
study
i didn't have the access to the full
text so i can't say for sure that it was
double blinded
but i'll give the authors the benefit of
the doubt now let's look briefly at
another study and this one is called a a
systematic review
now this review looked at 25 studies and
came up with the conclusion that
there is strong evidence to suggest that
there is no association between eating
frequency and weight
and that the limited evidence available
suggests no association between body
composition and eating frequency
now notice that this sort of evidence
sits at the very top
of the pyramid and as such it would be
held in much higher esteem
than that one cherry-picked study that
didn't even control for calorie content
between the experimental and control
groups
so guys the bottom line here is that all
experiments in all studies are not on
equal
footing some are of much higher quality
than others
and once the evidence is so heavily in
favor of any given theory
that simply just becomes accepted as
scientific truth
and if a study arises that challenges
the presently accepted scientific model
we don't just throw our hands up in the
air and disparage the scientific
enterprise as a whole
rather we look more closely at that
study see what sort of biases were
present
look at how the authors interpreted the
results
and then just move on from there and i'm
going to end this video by saying that
the whole statement you can find a study
to prove
anything is worded in a sort of
anti-scientific way to begin with
science doesn't actually set out to
prove anything
it isn't the goal of science to try to
prove things
rather scientists set out to collect
evidence
and then follow that evidence and that
data wherever it leads them
of course we're all humans and we all
have our own
individual biases but there is a full
systematic approach within the
scientific method
to reduce this bias as much as possible
and we have to be highly critical of
studies that
do not aim to do this alright guys i
hope
