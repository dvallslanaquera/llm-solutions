welcome to the third video in the series
in this video i'll be going through my
third week of training for this
motorcycle which turned out to be the
last week
last hard training week of the metacycle
i wound up having to
cut them as a cycle one week short
because i
had plans to go on holidays to london
for a few days and
furthermore training fatigue was getting
quite high
and i had reached roughly the level of
conditioning and or leanness
that i wanted to by this point in prep i
was aiming to be around
96 97 kilograms around 11 to 12 percent
body fat
and i roughly reached out now and so i
think it makes sense for me to cut my
mesocycle one week short
and start the mesocycle in a week from
now the next one
so i'll be spending the next
following this field week i'll be
spending the next
six weeks in a slight mass phase aiming
to gain around
a kilogram to maybe a kilogram and a
half so nothing crazy
still trying to minimize fat gain so it
doesn't make the
rest of prep and even more difficult um
i'll be specializing on chest and arm
growth so that includes biceps triceps
and forms
i would say for my physique specifically
my
stronger body parts tend to be my legs
sort of excluding my calves my calves
are
okay not good but not terrible either
um and calves generally don't contribute
that much to a physique compared to
other body parts
and so my legs are generally a pretty
strong area
my back as well but my chest and arms my
shoulders are
about as good as my back i'd say but
then my chest and arms are where my
physique is probably the weakest
and so i spoke about this with some
friends with some coaches
with dr mike as well and overall it does
seem like
the area that is the most improvement
for my physique to be at its best would
be
chest norms and so for the next six
weeks i'll be specializing on
chest and arms including forearms um
i think the reason why my
chest and arms are my weakest body parts
and why my legs and back
are my strongest body parts is because
when i started training
as i previously mentioned i believe i
didn't really focus on training my
chest and arms very much i mostly just
focused on training my back and
legs because well i just find more fun
and i thought hard training equaled to
good training
and training back and arms not back in
arms
back and legs was the hardest training
there was compared to training chest
norms
and so that's what i mostly stuck to and
also at the time
i played basketball
and so that was more helpful than
training like arms what have you
so in this session you can actually see
me training a different gym i trained in
a more
powerful thing-centric gym um
but yeah by this point in prep in
another cycle
what have you i was quite fatigued and
so
yeah i was feeling it um
hunger wise it's not been too bad it's
been quite manageable i've begun
introducing some
low and high calorie days via
lower and higher amounts of carbs the
evidence on refeeds
i wasn't particularly convinced to it
prior to seeing the latest
jeff nippert video i'd seen the studies
individually in mass
which is monthly applications in
strength sports which is essentially a
research review that comes out every
month about studies in bodybuilding
palliating
um most things related to lifting
weights
and so i've seen the individual studies
in mass and overall it just seemed like
it didn't really make much of a
difference but looking at the evidence
as a whole
uh by looking at the latest jeff nippert
video
it does seem like at the very least it's
probably not inferior and it might be
slightly better
for some things in certain circumstances
and so i'm now willing to consider it a
bit more
um which i guess is what evidence-based
practice is all about which is revising
your views as
you become aware of more evidence and
you learn more and more about
what the truth likely is um
so yeah i'm gonna start playing around
with higher salary days and lower
calorie days
via more carbs and fewer carbs i'm not
gonna apply refeeds in the more
traditional sense of having
one or two refeed days per week i'll be
applying them
in a more
having higher and lower carb days for
training and non-trading days
specifically so because you're training
um because on days you're training
you're expending more calories and
specifically likely
um depleting muscle glycogen to an
extent
it makes sense to have more carbs in
those days to aid with recovery
specifically after exercising is when
exercising being
stuff like walking as well uh basically
anything that really depletes
muscle glycogen so walking uh running
lifting weights as well lifting weights
doesn't deplete that much
muscle glycogen but it does deplete it
to an extent and if you want to optimize
recovery between sessions
especially if doing am pm sessions and
thus adaptations because
if you're not well recovered your
performance in the next session is going
to suffer
and if your performance in the next
session suffers then
your stimulus will also suffer so the
stimulus you get from that session is
going to be wise
which then over time can lead to less
gains than if you were properly
recovered between sessions
so even though it might seem like a
small detail during prep
and especially when doing higher volumes
and doing am pm sessions recovering as
much muscle glycogen between sessions as
possible can be
a fairly important detail and so i'm
going to start playing around with
lower and higher calorie days and see
how that goes
specifically i'll probably be sticking
around
2 000 to 2 200 calories on non-trading
base and then
on trading days which is five days of
the week
most of the time um i'll be doing
around 3 600 calories which overall
should
average out to around 3 000 calories per
day
3 100 calories per day which for me has
been sufficient to lose
nearly a percent of body weight a week
which for me is around a kilogram
um and yeah it's been pretty good
now you can see me training that other
gym again i was training with that
because some friends were training
and i joined them for this session um
they have some cool equipment like they
have a camera bar which is
a big favorite of mine for both bent
over rowing and for
benching i find for benching it sort of
gives you a really good stretch
and while still being wide grip um
one issue people can sometimes run into
with closer grip bench
is what does enhance range of motion for
triceps for delts
and chest if done properly um
it can sometimes be limited by tricep or
front delt strength which probably isn't
ideal
because the bench doesn't really grow
your tricep or front downs that well
if you look at direct studies on bench
pressing for example with reassess
muscle growth in different muscle groups
it does seem like
the triceps and front delts don't really
grow that well from benching whereas the
chest does
and so i think typically if you're going
to bench
do it for the aim of growing your chest
not so much your triceps and belts
and so why i like the camera bench press
camber board bench press is because
with wide grip it's typically easier to
reach
failure for your chest because of the
way the moment arms are set up
um and the wide grip also
in this case doesn't constrain range of
motion that much
because of the cabinet board and so you
get a deep stretch and that's quite nice
um you can see some vascularity coming
through now slowly
um prior to this prep and this cut right
now
i hadn't really ever seen much
vascularity in my physique
and i think that mostly comes down to a
perhaps not having the best genetics for
vascularity at higher body fat
percentages
and b mostly that's like by and large
the biggest reason
i just wasn't as lean as i thought and
that's something i mentioned back in the
first episode of this series
where i think beginners to bodybuilding
often make the mistake of thinking they
are much leaner than they are
and so i think that was also something i
did but i'm
i think getting increasingly better at
telling how fat i am
or lean hopefully um so right now my
body weight's around
97.5 kilograms which in pounds equals to
around
i want to say 215 215 pounds
and my body fat is likely around 12
13 which i'm pretty happy with um
hopefully it should only be around
seven to eight more kilograms of weight
loss until i hit stage rate
which in pounds is again maybe 16 to
18 pounds um and i have 20 weeks left
so again i'll be spending this next six
weeks in
a specialization phase in a slight mass
for my chest and arms
and then i'll be spending the remaining
well i'll be spending two weeks in
maintenance and then remaining 12 weeks
of prep
in a deficit to get steve lean
anyways you can do me swing you can see
me doing city squats here
again i mentioned this in last video but
i think they're good because they place
a lot of tension on the quads
in a full stretch which you don't get
from leg extensions and
having a lot of tension in a more
lengthened position of the muscle group
is likely pretty good for muscle growth
and
yeah um these are quite hard if you have
a squat bench i think that's
probably better
for stability purposes but i can be
pretty stable like this
by anchoring my hand onto a nearby
object and sort of using it for
stabilization should i need it i guess
one key is not to use it for
actually pulling yourself up which
requires you to be a little bit honest
with yourself
but i'm pretty good usually with staying
straight
so it's not really an issue for me
anyways then i moved on some leg curls
uh you can see me doing lying leg curls
here
and different machines really have
different weights on here
as with all machines and so one thing i
see people worry about a lot
is having different
gym memberships or having to travel and
having to use different machines
and fundamentally i sort of get it
because it makes tracking progression a
little bit more difficult
but as long as it's not you're not
switching gyms every session
i think tracking progression can be fine
let's say you're traveling one out of
five weeks to a different gym
for those four weeks just track your
performance as you really would
with same machines same weights and
everything
and then for that one week you're away
for holidays let's say
just aim to get the same rep ranges as
usual and aim to
go as close to failure as usual and
while the weight on the stack may not be
the same
the stimulus you impose for muscle
growth should be pretty comparable
because your muscle isn't any weaker at
that new gym than it was at the old gym
and so as long as rep range is similar
the effort or proximity failure is
similar
the stimulus you imposed for muscle
growth is gonna be pretty similar as
well and i
if you're only gonna be at that gym once
i wouldn't worry too much about writing
down the weights you used because
it's not really that useful you could
argue you should keep doing it for
uh habit formation of just you know
tracking your training in general
and that's a valid point but if you
don't it's not a huge deal i think
however if you do go back to that gym
pretty often like let's say you have a
second gym
you attend half the time you're training
or
you plan on going back to it
periodically like for example
i'm from belgium and so when i
go back to belgium there are a few gyms
i tend to go to
and i trained there when i was 16 17 as
well and so going back there now
with the data i have from back then it's
kind of cool because i can use the same
machines as back then
and sort of see okay i haven't used
machines in a while so i'm not
technically very proficient with them
but by going back there
and seeing how the performance changed i
can see okay
i did get quite a bit bigger or stronger
what have you and so i think that can be
useful as well
uh if you do have gyms that you go back
to periodically or fairly often
but if you only go there every now and
again i wouldn't worry too much about it
um yeah someone in commons
last week asked me about my measurements
which i guess i'll address measurements
as a whole first
i don't think measurements are that
useful overall as a standalone measure
they can be kind of useful in
conjunction with stuff like bodyweight
performance in compound exercises or
isolation exercises over
months and months and pictures
they can so they can be a decent add-on
to those measurements
but i think body parts circumferences
like oh
how big are your arms how big are your
legs thighs calves what have you aren't
that useful
the reason is unless you're trained to
take measurements
there is too much measurement error so
measurement error is whenever you take a
measurement of something
there's a certain range of error you
like you have by taking that measurement
because you're not perfectly trained
conditions are slightly different just
every time you take a measurement
you might be off by a couple percent and
so let's say your true or measurement is
16 inches like in my case for now um
sometimes you might take a measurement
and be like oh it's 15.5 inches and
sometimes it might be
16 and a half and so when you consider
that
and you consider that muscle growth
occurs very slowly
on a scale of weeks or months
measurement error is just bigger than
the actual changes you're trying to
measure
and so it can unless you're taking a lot
of measurements to sort of average out
that measurement error
it can be difficult to tell apart actual
change in
muscle size from
measurement error and so i'm not a huge
fan of
tape measurements for body parts
conference and that sort of thing
one area i think they can be a bit more
useful is for waist circumference
waist circumference can serve as a
decent proxy for body fat percentage in
both
men and women probably more so in men
because of the way
men store body fat
but yeah that's a bit more of a decent
measure because typically people don't
experience a ton of
um muscle growth in that area
but it is an area where people store a
lot of body fat
and so yeah i think measuring your waist
circumference can be a bit more useful
for
assessing body fat percentage now
i'll answer the question the comments
are asked last week which was what are
your measurements
and they asked specifically about my
arms uh
my thighs and my calves
so my calves and arms
are both 16 inches at this point in prep
or arms are flexed calves unflexed
oh with no pump um
so i've lost a little bit of fat mass
across my arms and
calves over this prep i think and then
my thighs at the largest point again
or around 66 67 centimeters
which in inches if i had to make the
conversion in my head right now
would be around 25
inches i think um
that sounds about right um
actually no that doesn't sound right at
all does it about
no about 26 27 inches something like
that
um you can do the conversion if you care
enough um
so yeah i'm looking forward to a deal of
the week now
i have switched a lot of my food choices
to more satiating choices so i think
something not many people speak about
with regards to carb
intake during prep or just in general
actually even when
just considering weight loss is the
continuum from
higher gi so glycemic index um
carbs that have less fiber typically
and that are less satiating and more
calorie dense
to carbs that are less calorie dense
have a higher have a lower gi so
glycemic index
higher fiber and are less calorically
dense
typically you'll want carbs that are
less calorically dense higher fiber
lower gi and less
calorie dense when you're hungry because
they tend to
serve the role of hunger management a
bit better so they tend to be more
satiating and so you can eat more of
them
for any amount of calories you have and
those can be really useful during prep
for example or during weight loss
and typically farther away from training
sessions
but then during a mass phase where
you're trying to get in
more calories and hunger might be an
issue and so far as
you don't have enough hunger to meet
your calorie needs
in that situation higher gi lower fiber
higher calorie carbs can be more useful
and so i think typically your carb
intake sources so like your food sources
whether it be
salad versus white rice versus sweet
potatoes versus
regular potatoes those choices
if your main goal is just body
composition and you don't have much of a
regard for taste or
convenience your main consideration that
should probably be
a replenishing glycogen after a session
and that's best done with lower fiber
carbs with higher gis glycemic indexes
that's after recession within a few
hours after a session and then b
uh considering hunger and so during a
prep that typically means sticking to
higher fiber carb sources um lower gi
carb sources less calorie dense carb
sources
that sort of thing and i think you can
sort of view your
carb source choices so where your carbs
come from whether it's white rice sweet
potato and so forth
um depending on where you fall in terms
of hunger
if you're very hungry stick to less
calorie dense
higher fiber lower gi carbs mostly but
if you're less hungry then you can stick
to mostly
higher gi carbs more calorie dense and
so forth and so really
what you should be trying to do is match
your hunger
or match your carb sources to your
hunger and i think that's a very good
approach for imaging
hunger overall if you're interested in
the sort of topic of hunger management
during prep but also during weight loss
i did write a brief article on my
website which is
wolf coaching so wolf like the animal
which is the last name coaching.net
and in that article called i think
hunger management strategies
i basically just go over some
evidence-based tips to manage your
hunger using food
during prep and so i think that could be
useful for
a lot of people it's some basic stuff
but typically
the things i mentioned with carb sources
um
getting your deficit mostly through meat
and
stuff like protein can be a bit more
satiating on a calorie
to calorie basis than other
macronutrients
and so yeah and some other tips as well
other tips as well so if you'd like to
check that out
um i'll put the link in the description
anyways that about wraps up this video
um if you enjoyed it as always please do
comment like subscribe i know everyone
says that and i
kind of hate myself for saying it but it
does help out the channel
and yeah i'll try and keep making these
weekly for the next 15 to 20 weeks
i've been quite busy recently with
coaching stuff as you see and i began my
internship with
dr mike israel over in south
polarization but once that
settles down and calms down a little bit
i can hopefully look into making other
videos as well
anyways thank you for supporting and
i'll see you again next week
