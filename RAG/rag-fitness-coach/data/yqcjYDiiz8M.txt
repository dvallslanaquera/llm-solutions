if at the bottom we focus on keeping our
chest up while simultaneously allowing
our scaps to travel forward
stretches the living fuck out of your
upper back and makes for an awesome
hypertrophy stimulus so instead of bent
rowing like this
where you'll notice the chest fall
forward what we do is Arch our back nice
and tight and begin with a chest super
upright and we're going to hold that
position chest up
oh
chest up Big Stretch
chest up oh fuck even with this demo
weight I feel my shit all fucked up
