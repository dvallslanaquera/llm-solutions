hey folks Dr Mike here from Renaissance
periodization and today we're going to
chat about what to prioritize in your
training not what muscle groups but what
more nerdy level of theoretical
ultrastructure man if I had a favorite
thing to talk about this would be in the
top ten for sure here's the thing
some of the stuff in your program that
you make for training is going to be
super surface level detail stuff that
doesn't matter a ton other stuff will be
much deeper and more fundamental
and it's imperative that you focus on
the more important stuff because that's
the stuff it's the gift that keeps on
giving and not even right away
the surface level stuff could be
important week to week month to month
but month to month year to year and for
your whole career if you get the very
basic foundational stuff correct you're
going to be milking the gains out for a
long time or if you only have the
surface level concerns addressed and you
have fundamental flaws with the basics
you're going to run into problems really
really quick let's explore what that
means and exactly what we should be
focused on most and then what we should
be focused on next after that and a
little bit less
first when designing a training program
and executing a training program
the number one concern you should have
is training quality which means at least
two things
in the following order first
technique
if you know how to do a bicep curl
properly
I can later tell you how many sets and
Reps to do and you'll get amazing games
if you don't know how to do a bicep curl
properly I can tell you sets and Reps
but my estimate of how many you need
might be off because you're doing the
thing wrong
and also it could be that you don't get
very good results or the results that
you could have got
for example if I know you have a solid
V8 engine in your car and it was built
well I can kind of tell you how to make
the rest of your car so it's a Top Fuel
dragster like Scott the video guy drives
but if you have a situation where your
engine was built wrong and
malfunctioning and sucks and it's really
a four-cylinder and it looks like an
eight cylinder
I I don't know what to tell you about
how to build the rest of your car and
even if I tell you all the more or less
right stuff it could be the right stuff
for the wrong engine you tell me it's a
V8 but it really performs like a V6 I
say when you got to have a car that can
handle that kind of uh you know torque
and I give you a heavier weight uh
elements to construct a car from and all
of a sudden the power weight ratio is
wrong and you don't need that sturdy of
a car because your engine isn't even
that fast
or that strong rather
technique is the core Foundation upon
everything else and it's thus the most
important now if you have good technique
versus bad technique week to week to
week it doesn't make much difference in
growth you can adjust by doing more reps
and more steps of bad technique you get
basically the same growth as you could
with a good technique but with fewer
reps and sets but over time the fatigue
and the muscle growth start to take off
and apart from each other and bad
technique catches up to you
technique is everything because it is
the first priority
the second priority still under the
emphasis or under the large control of
the variable of training quality which
has two of these variables training
quality
technique number one within that number
two within that
is a an ability to have a high relative
effort which means with good technique
and only with good technique you are
able to push your muscles very close to
failure or to failure given the need to
do so because if you have a really good
technique but you mail in all the sets
like I do because you guys know I don't
train that hard you end up not having
very good results even though your
Technique looks great you're stopping so
short of failure that you're not getting
all of the juice
squeezed out of your muscles that you
could
technique is first
High ability to do relative effort if
the ability to train hard on any one
given set is second
if you can do those well gee you're
really off to a good start they are the
building blocks of excellent training
if you make the rest of your program
and do the rest of your program with
technique and the ability to train hard
as a base you're going to do real well
for yourself
next up number two priority
is what I would call training structure
here's some examples of what that means
the order of exercises within muscle
groups
should I do bench presses first or flies
first for example the order of muscle
groups within the session should I do
chest first or back first or arms first
Etc
the number and placement of the sessions
within a given week
Monday if I do chest and triceps when do
I do chest and triceps again is it
Tuesday wrong answer
is it Thursday much better if we have
two times a week training of course
if you get this where to put the things
where to put the exercises properly
where to put the muscle groups properly
in a session and within the week between
sessions
you can have a logical foundation on
which to decide okay how many sets am I
doing of everything
but if you figure out how much you're
doing first
you may have to screw up your structure
to fulfill an amount that doesn't make
any sense
for example you can tell yourself well
you know I'm gonna do 30 sets of biceps
per week
that could end up having a training
structure that demands that you train
your biceps so frequently that they
don't recover or so much per every
session
they do recover but they barely grow
because each session does as much damage
as it causes growth the damage recovery
saps all the growth away
not good
you guys are seeing where I'm going with
this first we have high quality training
tiny building blocks
every rep we do with good technique
every set we do with a higher relative
effort
we take those reps and sets and insert
them into logical exercises that are
ordered properly within a session
those exercises are now ordered into
muscle groups that are also ordered
properly within a session
and the sessions are ordered properly
within the context of a typical week of
training
notice so far I haven't said a damn
thing about how many reps to do or how
many sets to do so any advice you hear
on the internet of do this many reps or
this many sets presupposes
that the training quality and the
training structure was at least thought
through to some extent and if it doesn't
presuppose that
it's not very well thought out
lastly and I do mean lastly
training quantity
is a question that we have to answer how
much load how much weight are we lifting
how many reps are we doing per set
with good technique from earlier with a
higher relative effort in a logical
weekly structure we can now answer these
questions how many sets
specially sets
per muscle group per workout and per
week
now that we have a logical structure
onto which to lay them out we can answer
these questions really well because the
logical structure hems in some of our
answers
should I do 10 sets of quads today
what are you doing tomorrow when's your
next quad workout if it's in four days
 tense that sounds good
if it's in two days you're not going to
be recovered so I actually cannot answer
the question of quantity before you
answer to me the question of
your training structure but hold on
you said 10 sets of quads but how is
your Technique and how was your relative
f if your Technique is spot on your
relative effort is high bro nobody out
there recovering from 10 sets of quads
even if half a week you guys have seen
our videos on this channel if you
haven't checked them out we train real
people real ifb pros and all sort of
stuff we usually do like six sets of
quads these barely crawl
at a workout they're sore for a week but
if I know you're not training with a
high level of quality yeah 10 sets is
good maybe you should even do 15. but
really you shouldn't really you should
attend to your quality first
foreign
once you know the core of quality is
there on the foundation of structures
there how much how many reps how much
load how many sets is just a matter of
filling in the blanks to get reasonable
starting positions and then Auto
regulating based on recovery and
soreness and all that other stuff if you
recovered well on time for your sessions
increase the amount of quantity if
you're having trouble recovering keep
the quantity the same
if you can't recall for sure reduce the
quantity it's just pretty much that easy
with some details in there
now you can do this process out of order
as long as at some point in your
calculation of how to do your training
plan you attend to quantity to structure
and to Quality
but as far as priorities go
if you have great quality and structure
those can stay the same and quantity is
easy to change
but if you have a certain given quantity
that you just decided you want to do
and a certain given structure in which
you want to do it you may realize for
example well I want to do 10 sets of
quads twice a week quantity structure
if your quality is high as high as it
should be from the start you may not be
able to do that many sets it's too much
because you're too good at
training each set is so stimulative you
will never survive 10 sets twice a week
so now what do you do if you determine
your quantity first and your frequency
second
backwards as something like German
volume training sorry I've got a German
volume cold
then you have to end up
 with your quality
somebody catches you doing half reps on
the leg press and they're like bro what
the you're like trying to do 10
sets man every twice a week
dummy if I do it with good technique I
won't be able to do 10 sets I need bad
technique to survive this ah you guys
see where I'm going with this brain
explosion
all right so you may be thinking all
right
okay Boomer
which if you tell me on the internet I
will laugh with you Namaste if you tell
me in real life I'm gonna do Jiu Jitsu
to you until you hurt badly and I'm
gonna say what was that you said you
Zoomer little tick tocker I'm
kidding I'm getting ahead of myself
how does this help me get laid is what
you probably want to know though I can't
get you laid because I've never been
laid myself I can absolutely try to give
you some more decent examples of how
this would work in the real world
if you ask as many people do in the
comments section here in the YouTube
videos or at Instagram or wherever you
go whoever you ask
how many sets of biceps should I be
doing or you tell me hey I've done 10
sets of biceps workout I don't seem like
I'm growing
how many sets should I be doing it is a
question I actually cannot answer with
due diligence until and unless I see
your Technique and until unless I see
your relative effort
one of my close friends Dr James Hoffman
who was a sports scientist at
Renaissance periodization he coaches a
bunch of people and he has like the
James squint eye that he gives anytime
people give incredible volume claims and
say like oh well like it's not working
for me I recover really easily and it's
just not enough so I do 30 sets of back
per week James gives the squint why
because then he requests the video he's
got clients that are people who
eventually were as clients when they
first started with him they said well
this is how much I'm typically doing he
looks at those numbers and he's like ah
interesting
give me a video of you doing your set of
squats and inevitably people are going
halfway down and stopping with six reps
in reserve on every set and then he has
to go back to them and say I'm not going
to tell you how many sets to do until
you fix your and they're like what
does that mean he teaches them how to
squat all the way down he teaches them
how to push themselves on every set and
all of a sudden four sets of squats
later they've thrown up blood and
they're like oh
I didn't need 30 sets did I exactly you
don't want to be the person that asks
the impossible question the question
that cannot be answered because you
didn't attend to the very critical
underpinning of what that answer would
look like
if you want to know quantity I gotta
know the quality
very shitty analogy but nonetheless
makes sense to say hey like how many
burritos should I be eating per day
ah how big are the burritos are they
little Taquito things you buy at the
store 100 are they full stuff
Double Stuffed super burritos too
big difference
next example
if you ask about how many reps you
should do on quad movements for example
all you'll get out of me and anyone else
competent is up somewhere between 5 and
30 reps and if you want to know more we
have to know your training structure
what exercises are you doing how are you
spacing out the exercises where in the
session are they occurring it would be
kind of stupid to do sets of five to ten
in the squat in most cases after like an
hour of upper body work it's just too
weak to make use of that rep range but
you can drive metabolites so then it's
oh maybe not the squat see maybe it's
leg press so you're
lower back can be out of the equation
and then it's sets of 15 to 25. that
makes sense only in context
have to know the structure first before
we can give you an amount
but positive example if I know I've seen
you I've trained with you or in your our
team full ROM Forum that we have Link in
the description and I've seen your chest
work and your technique is
amazing your relative effort is off the
 charts
and it was actually a gentleman I'll
just call about my name in the team for
rum Forum his name is I think he's
Italian Pierre Francisco lucente
I assume he does this every time he
speaks go racism
culturism in any case he has like
God level technique and psychotic
relative
if he asks me
how heavy to go on chest movements and I
know his structure is amazing because
he's super smart makes
Incredible training plans it's it's so
easy for me to be like start here and go
up
because I don't have to assume like wait
hold on a sec I don't have to think
about what does this technique look like
how hard is he training I know both of
those so I can give him a low ball
estimate of like start with two
exercises on every chest sorry two sets
on every chest exercise and only do two
exercises of chest every session as I
know that you're doing two chest
sessions a week he wouldn't even answer
well why so little he knows for him he's
like oh that's actually plenty because
every time he does flies he rips apart
the Earth trying to do flies
that good of technique and that however
so
that's the real deal
at the end of the day
do not let some features of your program
like volume
fix the inadequacies of others like your
Technique sucks so you have to do more
volume and eventually get too fatigued
and increase your probability of injury
because you're putting a Band-Aid on a
problem that requires um we're a really
fine-tuned robotic surgery and then
voila once your Technique is great once
you're training hard once your structure
is logical the answer of how much should
I train is really much simpler and has a
known answer or at least a known Pathway
to explore what that answer is
but if your structure is a question mark
or blows dick if your training technique
and training effort is a question mark
or they both blow dick then there is no
right answer that somebody could give
you because the core of your program is
rotten
trying
to have some features
fix the inadequacies of others in the
system
is like dating the same shitty people
over and over again and expecting for
them not to freak out on you and slam
the car door in their Camaro and drive
away leaving you with wilted flowers and
you're pretty sundressed in the middle
of cold dark evening Street and mid
1980s Urban America how's that for a
 scene folks thanks for tuning in
