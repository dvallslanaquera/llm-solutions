How well does the bench press develop the
triceps?
Brandao et al. had previously untrained men
perform the barbell bench press with a 2x
shoulder-width grip for 3 to 5 sets of repetitions
to failure with an 80% one-rep max load, twice
per week for 10 weeks.
They experienced pretty good growth of the
lateral head, fairly decent growth of the
medial head, but very little growth of the
long head.
Wakahara et al. found similar results with
a dumbbell bench press.
They had subjects perform the dumbbell bench
press with a neutral hand position and found
that activation of the long head, measured
by T2 weighted imaging, was much less than
that of the medial and lateral heads.
Therefore, bench pressing is likely good at
growing the lateral and medial heads, but
poor for the long head.
