hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance
periodization you've been asking about
them
and now it's time to talk about them
mini cuts
not the regular sized cuts which are
often too long
not the micro cuts which are too short
mini cuts
we're going to talk about a few things
and dive
pretty far in depth now here's the deal
if this isn't in depth enough for you
in the description we've put the link
for our very own book which came out a
while ago but still very pertinent
the mini cut manual it answers all the
stuff i'm going to give a grand tour of
today
in super high depth so
today we're going to define what a mini
cut actually is
turns out the definition is very simple
we're going to talk about when
and how to use mini cuts to your
advantage and what it is they accomplish
we're going to talk about when and how
not to use mini cuts and when they're
not a good idea and this is a
that's going to take a a pretty good
chunk of this presentation
because a lot of people use mini cuts
when they're really not supposed to be
it's a really tempting thing to really
misuse
we're going to talk about choosing the
mini cut for you for your particular
circumstances and if and how you should
choose one
and then of course we're going to talk
about some very common mini cut
follies and mistakes all too common in
this case
so how do we define a mini cut at rp we
define a mini cut with essentially two
uh criteria one is how fast the weight
loss occurs
faster than a normal cut so it's 0.75 to
1.25 percent
weekly weight loss target and
it's a cut that is two to six weeks in
duration
normal cuts generally for us for our
general population
are six to 12 weeks in duration yeah you
can do longer but then you're probably a
competitor
if you're not a competitor you probably
shouldn't be doing cuts that are longer
than 12 weeks at a time and in most
cases
shorter than six weeks at a time unless
it's a mini cup which is a very specific
purpose and that's two to six weeks
maybe cutting less time than two weeks
probably doesn't accomplish a whole lot
and the sort of instability dietary
body water training-wise mood of just
the transition
is like most of the cut anyways if you
mini cup for a week and a half it's just
a lot of
just getting settled into a diet and
then you're done with the diet not a
whole lot happens
generally two to six weeks is where we
go now you'll notice
if you're astutely reading the slides
that
that weight loss target of roughly one
percent
per week but it can be higher is
it says there via forward assumed
calorie deficit
not auto regulation of body weight in
most good well-executed cuts
you have a target and then as you
measure your body weight
your body weight is either off track too
much off track way not enough or really
close to where you're supposed to be
and then you change how much food you're
eating calorie wise
or increase or decrease your activity
based on how close that curve
is to the target line in many cuts
there's so much going on with body water
shifts
when you lose a ton of glycogen uh
differences in
intake of salt and etc a lack of cheat
meals which you used to take
there's so much going on with body water
and then towards the end of many cuts
stress
really diet stress starts to come up
real high because you're not gnarly
deficit
the body water problem is this it's
almost impossible to make on the fly
changes
it's just too short of a window so what
we usually do
like in a six week mini cut you may be
able to make one or two changes but in a
two week mini cut i mean
it's guess and go that's what the
forward assumed calorie deficit is you
take your current calories and
maintenance
and you chop off however many you think
is going to lead to that
roughly one percent per week loss and
then you just go
because people be like oh my god like i
cut whatever amount of calories that i
thought was gonna lose me like two
pounds a week which was the one percent
but all of a sudden i'm losing you know
i lost like eight pounds this last week
oh should i eat more well no
because almost exclusively that eight
pounds or the vast majority of it is
gonna be body water
and you really didn't lose eight pounds
of tissue and if you try to calculate
stuff there's just essentially
tons of noise and not a whole lot of
signal so in a mini cut
typically not always typically what
you're going to do is you're just going
to
slash your calories however much you
think is a good guess
and then go and if it's a two three or
four week mini cut you
just do that at the end once your body
fills back up with glycogen fills back
up with salt and water
you're maintaining or whatever you were
doing or massing before the mini cup
then you mini cut and then all the water
fluid comes back and you might be down
whatever you're down but that only comes
out on the wash it's a process you can't
analyze as it's going
with a six week mini cut you may be able
to make like one or two changes like the
first week
first two weeks come by and you really
just aren't losing as much weight as you
planned
feel free to make another subtraction of
calories or an increase in cardio
whatever
that's totally fine but you just and
then another two weeks comes by
you maybe you can make another uh
alteration once a week is probably a bit
too frequent
so basically maybe you get two maybe
three changes like that in a 60 minute
but on average it's really kind of like
a sort of set your bearings and hit the
button and go kind of situation
uh and and it's not it's like a fire
forget
it's not a thing where you ought to
regulate really well because some people
say well the first week i lost x y and z
what does that mean
we just don't know what it means we have
to take a longer time to figure that out
in a longer time you usually do not have
on a mini cup
so when and how do you use mini cuts
there are two ways to use mini cuts
fundamentally one is to potentiate or
increase the expression
of muscle size gains in your hypertrophy
training plan
so what you would do there is you would
reduce your training volume to
maintenance volume
which is uh maintenance volume for a
mini cut is roughly what your minimum
effective volume would be
for a hypertrophy phase on lots of food
so much less volume than you're
typically normally doing basically you
start your volume at a normal starting
amount but you never move it up
you keep it at whatever you start with
four sets of squats by the end of the
mini cut it's still four sets you don't
go up to six seven eight none of that
stuff so you keep your volume low
because you want your body to
resensitize to volume during that cut
so that when you move into your masking
phase after you're sensitive to
volume you're sensitive to growth and
you just stitched a whole lot of body
fat you don't want to be in a scenario
you're trained really hard through your
mini cut
and then you're really just tired at the
end of it and yeah you lost a bunch of
body fat
but you've also accumulated a ton of
fatigue we don't want to accumulate
excessive fatigue
all we need to do is preserve our muscle
we're not be growing any muscle in a
mini cut the
deficit is way too extreme for that so
we're just going to go to maintenance
volume so that's number one
number two is the result of that or
actually
so once we reduce the volume super low
we cut that big deficit chunk
losing it as fast as 1.25 per week
after we figure out at the end of the
whole process but a
really really nasty chunk so for a lot
of people that means potentially
a 1 000 calorie per day reduction like
that's gnarly that's a lot of food
gone from your diet and what that can do
is make room for more muscle gains
without adding a ton of fat so for
example
you're gaining weight and anytime you're
gaining weight and training hard
it's usually going to be a combination
of muscle and fat so you start at maybe
12 or 14
body fat ish you don't have to measure
these things exactly
let's say you had pretty clear abs and
then over the last several months you
could put on tons of strength tons of
muscle
but your abs are getting real blurred
out you know you're starting to huff and
puff a little bit love handles puffing
up
if your bodybuilder was real serious
about this your blood work came back and
it was like not the greatest thing ever
and and you also know maybe if you're a
bodybuilder or just someone who's really
focused on their appearance
you don't want to ever get too out of
shape to where it would take a crazy
huge diet to get you back in shape like
if you mask for 40 weeks straight
and never do a mini cut like you could
be pretty fat at the end of that 40
weeks and people are like you're a
bodybuilder i thought you were a sumo
wrestler and you're like dang it
so there's a lot of good arguments to
keeping your fat levels under control
and basically
you gain muscle and fat and then a mini
cut what it does is it takes the fat you
gained
some of it most of it maybe it just gets
rid of it you keep the muscle and then
you've opened up enough room
so maybe you start at 12 percent fat and
you get to 16
and then you do a mini cut and maybe
you're down to 13 to 14 fat which
buys you more time to never get above 16
or 18 or 20 or wherever you want to set
your
pretty arbitrary limit of how much fat
you want to gain because a lot of people
like once their abs disappear
they're just not into that sort of thing
which is totally fine now we used to say
but there was pretty decent evidence or
at least our average supposition was
that the p
ratio the amount of muscle versus fat
that you gain
was heavily influenced by your starting
body fat level
and that being closer to 10 percent when
you start a mass phase gains you much
more fractionally much more muscle than
starting at like 20
percent or 30 that 30 things probably
still true
but a lot of uh recent evidence has been
collected unfortunately
it's all indirect uh especially great
work by the stronger by science guys who
should be following on youtube and
everywhere else eric trexler
specifically
a lot of that has shown that maybe we're
not as confident this is a very
charitable interpretation of his work
maybe we're not assured that the p
ratio is really affected uh if
you know there's no convincing evidence
that being leaner
really makes you put on muscle that much
better he would probably take the other
interpretation
of maybe the evidence is even in reverse
and if you're closer to 10
body fat you may actually not put on
muscle as well and put on more fat
i'm not of that opinion currently as of
the filming of this video but we're all
scientists we're super open-minded so
we're not sure
the real thing is i wouldn't bet on the
p ratio a ton
i think being a little bit on the leaner
side is still better for a variety of
reasons
potentially p ratio being one of them in
my humble view
but if that doesn't pan out forget the p
ratio forget
re-sensitizing yourself to more gains
maybe that's the thing maybe it's not
fundamentally though you can't just keep
gaining muscle and fat forever
because you're super fat at the end of
that process you don't want that because
your skin stretches out you multiply fat
cells you have to do a crazy diet
and potentially lose muscle to get all
the way back down to being lean
and you just walk around fat you know
your training suffers because your
endure suffers and look at the end of
the day like
this is a like a muscle building
physique channel we run here right and
i what i mean to say is you guys are
interested in looking a certain way
if i'm like look you're going to put on
tons of muscle you're like sweet i'm
taking notes you're like and get super
fat you're like
is there a way we like put on a lot of
muscle without getting super super fat
like yes this is the way
you do a mini cut every now and again
not obsessively we'll talk about that
later
but you essentially like gain muscle and
fat and you strip the fat gain muscle
and fats trip the fat at some point that
process doesn't work anymore we'll have
to use harsher measures
but it really does buy you some time
it's like you still need vacations
throughout the year if you work super
hard
but weekends do a lot to really relieve
a bunch of stress right
so you think of mini cuts as the
weekends to the week it really preps you
for the next week of work
to be much more productive potentially
right so
as soon as you're finished with a mini
cut because you're using it to
potentiate mass gains you go
usually right into a mass gaining phase
right after the mini cut if it's a
longer mini cut and this is really
covered in the book much better than i
can say it here
four to six week meaning cut you may
want to bring down that
mild diet fatigue that you have with
like a one or two week
maintenance active rest sort of
situation right after that so you may
want to keep your training volume low
start eating at maintenance for one or
two weeks really relieve a lot of diet
fatigue and then start gaining
that's a little bit much nuance for this
video but generally for the shorter mini
cuts
you may cut an income any kind stop
start masking again
appetite wise desire to train wise with
high volumes
a mini cut is kind of designed to
slingshot you into better masking
psychologically physically so on and so
forth and because you're leaner
you now have further to go so that's
definitely a thing
you can do some cardio but i would
recommend limiting it especially if you
want bigger legs
because doing a ton of cardio let's say
you're like man i don't want to cut food
i'm going to do a mini cut and just
increase cardio a bunch you can do that
but usually cardio is
really really heavy on the legs or hard
on the legs it creates a lot of local
fatigue for the legs
and it doesn't let their legs
resensitize hypertrophies one of the big
things about the mini cut
isn't actually the cut in this case it
is the fact that you're taking your
volumes of training very low for quite
some time two to six weeks
your body will be very sensitive to
ramping up to higher volume training
later and thus get more hypertrophy
if you do a ton of cardio during a mini
cut your legs may not experience that
because they're getting volume but
actually they're getting it through
cardio
which is both catabolic to muscle at
some point and
makes it so that your legs are sort of
still resistant to hypertrophy at the
other end of the process
i would keep unlike a normal cut i would
keep mini cut cardio
to the low end of things which means
yeah like
you're gonna have to eat a lot less
which sucks
bad side on the good side it doesn't
last that long so no big deal and
towards the end of a massing phase which
is when you implement a mini cup
you guys probably know from experience
you're not into food at all anymore like
if someone tells you at the end of a
mass like hey
can you cut a thousand calories from
your diet yes thank god where the hell
have you been my whole life i'm tired of
eating all this crap
i'm stuffing myself every day finally
someone says eat less and then
really you just kind of start to get
nice and hungry and like real agitated
about getting more food
towards the end of the mini cut which
dot dot is it one of its biggest
purposes psychologically
is to get you both metabolically and
psychologically
ready to eat more food continue to push
the food
and mass up and have a productive mass
after i'll tell you this if the mini cut
is over
and you look at how much food you have
to eat amassing you're like i can't
believe i have to eat this much
you probably need a longer actual cut to
get nice and lean to get that hunger
back because it's going to be a painful
time for you to keep climbing up
if you're at the end of a mini cut still
not super hungry
so that's option number one so just to
be clear
option number one is using the mini cut
this is ways to use a mini cut
properly option one is to use it to make
your next mass phase
better or at least give it some room so
that you don't get ultra fat
super fine there's another option which
is very distinct
tia which stands for temporarily
improved appearance
okay let's say you have a photo shoot or
some kind of event
like your ex-girlfriend is getting
married to the guy you hate
and she invited you by accident you
gotta show up
rip to shreds everything and like in the
middle of the wedding
when someone's like you know when they
say like speak now forever hold your
peace
rip off your tux hit a front double most
muscular maybe like a real technical
side tricep
shock the crowd right i don't even know
what the hell i'm saying anymore it's as
if i've done this before
in any case beach party weekend getaway
blah blah cruise
somewhere where you want to look good
with minimal clothing or even incline
right if that's the case sometimes those
events life you know planning for one
thing
sometimes those events kind of sneak up
on us or dropped in on us
someone's like hey we're going on a
cruise in july
and like they're telling you this in
early june
and you're like oh that sounds really
fun like i'm actually free in july
and look sweet get ready for the cruise
it's gonna be fun tons of single people
it's gonna be great we're gonna mix it's
awesome we're
going to the huge group of 20 people and
what's her name's coming she's really
into you remember you're like oh yeah
that's right
and you look at yourself in the mirror
like i'm like 20 weeks into massing this
is terrible
like i told people i lift weights this
guy that set me up with this girl is
telling her i lift weights and i look
like i just lift my fork to my mouth
this is not good so in those scenarios
right or if you're like a
model or actor or something like that
because you know tons of models and
actors watch this channel who knows
maybe right
you got to be in shape now like soon
you can use a mini cut to jam a ton of
fat off your
body and you will pay the cost of that
but not like it's not like deadly or
some shit we'll get into it later
but you are essentially not trying to
potentiate anything after
after a tia mini temporarily improved
appearance
you're gonna have to do a lot more
cleanup than you get potentiation
okay it's gonna be a lot of fatigue
you're not gonna be in muscle building
mode especially afterwards nothing like
that nothing like that first option
where we many cut to optimize size gains
this is very different but
because of that you can lose a lot of
fat more than the potentiating gains one
really quickly really alter your
appearance you show up to that cruise
with 20 of your friends and people you
haven't met yet
and you look in the park you're looking
lean and all of a sudden that girl's
like hey
and you're like uh what up you know i've
never actually successfully talked to a
girl
past that stage so i have no idea where
to take the joke after this
in any case what you do is some not so
subtle differences
for this mini cut style for the tia you
blast cardio
because like you just have to impose as
much of a deficit from all
angles as possible you will slash your
food you will blast cardio
you will suffer all for that model look
you've been groomed for your whole life
you train hard
mav to mrv training like a decent amount
of training
fatigue will escalate rapidly in this
case but the fat loss will be massive
because when you're stimulating a ton
of uh essentially myofibrillar turnover
with training your muscles are turning
over all the time tons of
damage etc that's going to require more
inputs for nutrients
you may even at the first part of the
mini cut especially grow a little bit of
muscle
then lose some towards the end no joke
um and all of that takes tons of energy
which means
more fat burning actually occurs it's a
brutal brutal process
some of this stuff happens sort of by
accident when hollywood actors need to
get in shape i'm sure some of you guys
have seen some of the plans published
like muscle and fitness
would be like this actor got abs in six
weeks and you look at the plan you're
like oh my god
he eats chicken breasts and drinks kale
juice and he
does do two hours of running every day
and and then he just like yells in the
mirror
for the other time like this is brutal
that's what it takes to make huge
changes fast
and you pay for it because it's not
sustainable long term
fatigue will be high it will not result
in muscle growth potentiation
and you're probably going to need a low
volume or active rest phase
after to really cool everything down
reduce
increase your sensitivity of your
muscles you know fix all the connective
tissue and stuff like that because
you're kind of
not a wreck you're going to look good
but you're going to be real beat up
after one of these things
however if it's all for the look if it's
all worth it to you do it intelligently
know what you're getting yourself into
i'm skipping ahead a little bit but one
of the follies
is doing a tia mini cup when you think
you're potentiating size gains
don't do that but we'll get to that in a
little bit all right
so who is a candidate for these
mini cuts okay well people
that want to potentiate size gains and
are serious about it or people that
knowing and understanding the trade-offs
super high fatigue you need to take a
break after
it's going to be really tough not great
for long-term goals
people who need temporarily improved
radically improved appearance
who is not a good candidate for many
cuts some of these may shock you news at
11. all right so here's the deal
strength athletes you're like oh my god
like some of you
lol are strength athletes have been
watching and taking notes be like
i just wasted 15 fucking minutes talking
to this guy's mini cut and i'm not even
a candidate population this is
bullshit and you throw your pen at the
screen bounces back hits you in the face
shitty day i'm sorry but here's the
thing
mini cuts impose such a huge caloric
deficit
it affects your training a ton and
as far as fundamental realities of
training if i know nothing else bullshit
phds for not shit i know that training
quality
is something you pretty much never want
to trade away especially as a strength
athlete
if you are a strength athlete and you
can't come in and hit robust numbers
you can't hit your planned progressions
if you're that energy depleted
the whole thing's a sham because
someone's like how's your mini cut going
you're like great i'm losing a ton of
weight they're
awesome higher lifts like total shit
like wait a minute aren't you a power
lifter like yep
so what does this mean for your contest
coming up you know your competition like
i don't know
i figure when i stop the mini cut maybe
it'll magically come back like yeah but
you've spent weeks not handling super
heavy loads like you planned
even if your strength sort of comes back
you're fighting from behind because you
have that your competitors
have been having great workouts for
three weeks you've been having shitty
workouts even if you do make
a comeback which is not clear you will
make that comeback so
strength athletes and this is the god
honest truth they just need to put in
the time to do regular
slow slow cuts strength athletes usually
shouldn't cut faster
than like half a percent per week i know
it sucks
maybe 0.75 but no faster than that i
mean 0.75 is really like in extreme
circumstances that already kind of
counts
as a mini cut itself so if you're a
strength athlete
if your performance suffers the whole
thing is gone with a mini cut it
probably will
mini cut is not a good idea if you're a
strength athlete start way
if you're out of shape or way out of
your weight class start months in
advance
gently gradually easily cut the fat
while having great training preferably
in a hypertrophy or high volume phase
get to a few percent points from where
you make your water cut or whatever
and then maintain into the competition
so
that's the thing i would love it if many
cuts were for strength athletes they
just generally don't
not only is this sort of scientifically
derived on the principles i've tried the
shit myself when i was a strength
athlete and on tons of clients you know
saying living you learn sorry old
clients
and it just doesn't fucking work like it
works one time out of 10. you want those
odds sweet i don't
right next long-term sustainable fat
loss
is done by long easy smooth cuts
with maintenance phases and potentially
many masses in between
they are not done with crazy psycho mini
cuts and here's why
the mini cut is designed to to
slingshot you back into gaining weight
that's the whole
fucking purpose of it what kind of plan
is it
to lose long-term weight with a
slingshot that sends you in the other
direction
at the end of a mini cut you're
sensitized to grow
you're fucking ravenously hungry and
voila what does that result in probably
weight gain
mini cutting people see and we had a big
problem like a pr problem at rp
lol um we had a big problem with as soon
as we started talking about mini cuts
and especially when the mini cup manual
book came out we had a lot of people who
we knew
they told us their goal was long-term
slow and steady weight loss they were
like
mini cut is that for me should i buy the
book or a bunch of them actually bought
the book and we had to do some refunding
where we were like look
look this is a strategy
for temporarily improved appearance or
potentiating gains
do you want to potentiate gains they're
like no i want to lose weight over the
long term
mini cutting is a stupid idea because
it's literally backwards to what you
want to do
you want to take six to 12 week cuts
with maintenance phases in between
not many cuts so long-term sustainable
fat loss mini cut it's designed to
rebound you terrible idea
related to this point a lot of the
people that get themselves into point b
there where they think it's a long-term
sustainable fat loss plan is
thinking that the mini cut has all the
benefits of a regular cut
none of the downsides or or same
downsides we'll say
but it's just faster folks this is how
it works okay
if you get a race car that's tuned
here's another car analogy for you guys
probably sick of it by now
if you get a race car that goes 230
miles an hour it probably doesn't have a
coffee maker in it or a dvd screen
or awesome or any air conditioning this
just doesn't come with the car right
there are trade-offs to fat going faster
you have to strip things off in order to
make room for you know that power weight
ratio so on and so forth just the same
way
if you're going real fast in a mini cut
that comes with trade-offs
okay if we had found out
that many cuts had all the same costs as
regular cuts except you just got the
weight off faster
we wouldn't call them mini cuts we'd
just call them cut cuts and it would
just be a revolution and be like hey you
guys
remember what used to take you 12 weeks
or yeah well it takes you six now rp
like sweet we'd be trillionaires but
that's just not the case
and it's super tempting i know i'm
tempted myself it's like wait a minute
i've been great you know you're in week
nine of a regular cut and you're like
i hate this why am i here i wish i could
get this done faster
and you see instagram you're scrolling
around and someone's like mini cut and
you're like
look at the new mini cup why am i doing
a mega cut this is dumb
because mega cuts regular cuts work
really well for that big magnitude of
loss
and a sustainable loss many cuts don't
so don't be tempted to think that
they're a shortcut
they're not another one
when not to use mini cuts is at a rate
much greater than
planned 1.25 percent per week loss
can you potentially lose at a calorie
deficit that roughly translates to like
1.5
per week loss body weight yes
you now risk significant muscle loss and
worse than that because you can regain
muscle really fast
a lot of fatigue if you cut real deep
two percent let's say some crazy shit at
the end of your three week mini cut
which you're supposed to potentiate into
a mass phase after
you are destroyed you are so fatigued
and so beat up from just a crazy
calorie deficit that your mass face
sucks it's ruined
so yeah mini cuts are more aggressive
than regular cuts by not
by that much regular cuts if you guys
have been interested in the rp
literature that we put out are roughly
between half a percent per week
loss and one percent mini cuts are sort
of right
in it up the middle with 0.75 to 1.25
can you go faster
yes if you're experienced you know it
works for you and it doesn't fatigue you
if you're doing your first mini cut or
your second or third
be easy start on the easier side of
things start at 0.75
1.0 maybe 1.25 if you get real
aggressive
don't go crazy because you will pay the
price look again
if we had a formula but which you could
lose two percent per week
and it would lose no muscle and you
wouldn't accumulate fatigue of course
we'd recommend it
that's just not the reality right and
as i mentioned before don't mini cut you
know if you have less than two weeks to
go
or if you're trying to do longer than
six don't do it so less than two weeks
we covered already that's not enough
time to get things going
longer than six people do try so that's
basically a regular diet but way
outside of the loss rate that we
recommend so for example
you can try to diet for eight weeks at
1.25 percent per week
uh good god um that diet will burn many
people
right the fuck out and it'll lead to
binging and cheating in tons of people
or in the super dedicated ton of fatigue
that you'll have to clean up at the back
end maybe muscle and strength loss
not a good idea aggressive diets should
be done shorter
less aggressive diets can be done for
longer and there's no
way to really break that sort of law of
the universe all right
so how do you choose
the mini cut that's right for you
specifically to your needs
right so if you're getting a bit fat for
your
tastes and preferences but you'd like to
keep massing on a massing phase you'd
like to keep gaining weight
you can absolutely do a mini cut
probably if you've never done one before
start at something sort of in the middle
one percent weight loss per week
rough goal right and it's
a four week mini cut two week mini cuts
you really have to know your body pretty
well to know you're for sure in a good
deficit that's not too unsustainable but
is right on
six week mini cut like you can do that
but like that can be pretty rough and if
you
haven't survived a four week mini cut
productively not just survived
uh productively potentiated masking
after
six weeks might just leave you too beat
up because you might bite off more than
you can choose so four weeks and 1
is a good idea roughly to start at and
then
when you do that you do a standard
mesocycle maintenance volume which is
same as your minimum effector volume for
massing and after that
when the deal of week comes you go right
to maintenance because deal should be
done in maintenance it's just a pretty
hard rule pretty hard rule
and then you de-load for a week after a
maintenance and then you resume massing
easy peasy not super complicated once
you do your first one
you can next time do five weeks at you
know 0.75
or five weeks so 1.25 whatever you want
whichever way you want and remember
it's always a good idea to note how you
feel potentially write things down
and go you'll get for next time i think
i want to wiggle it in this direction
something like that now
if you are at the
very high end of your acceptable fat
range
mini cuts might just not
get you what you want to do right
if you say to yourself like okay 22
fat ish like love handle starting to
peel over the jeans
is the most fat i'll ever gain if you
mini cut
from that you're gonna get to just under
that fat at the end of a mini cut
let's say you lose two percent fat
during a mini cup which is actually
pretty impressive
if you lose that you're down to 20 which
is real close to 22
and in a few short weeks you're real fat
again at the top end of what you want
as far as top end fatness do you really
if you continue to mini cut like that at
that top end fatness
really kind of designing a plan for
yourself to be fat or really close to
fat all the time that's probably not
what you want
you might want to be like you know i'm
really just much better off uh
between the 14 to 20 range 22 at the
most
what do you do then well mini cuts won't
get you there mini cuts will not get you
from 22 to 14
what you need there is an active rest
phase or a resensitization phase
and then a real slow normal fat loss
phase
8 to 12 weeks get all the fat off that
you want to get off
take a little active rest at the end of
that or a deload week or something like
that and then start massing again
super fine idea and there's a lot of
ways to slice that but basically like
if you have a lot of fat to lose many
cuts won't get you there
now if you have to be lean asap
or as lean as possible asap the tia mini
cut is the way to go
go as hard as you need to but beware of
a few things
the harder longer you go the bigger the
rebound is going to be and here's the
thing
if you're going on that cruise vacation
with a bunch of singles kind of like a
cool tv show i guess
if you diet super hard you rebound just
as hard
when you're on that cruise ship if you
want to continue to look
not super watery the whole time
manage your food intake eat mostly
healthy still get lots of physical
activity
sweat plenty get plenty of fluids that
don't have a ton of sodium in them
and you'll kind of look the part the
entire time or most of the time
if you do a mini cut a tia mini cut and
you you show up on a cruise ship
ripped a few days of crazy psycho eating
won't gain you that much body fat but
you'll gain so much body water you look
like a bottle a water balloon
so mind that rebound be careful if you
want to look the part you might
you're not dieting when you get on the
cruise ship but you're not going all out
all the time
there is something to say for that and
i guess i was going to read the next
part too like you might look like a
puffer fish towards the end of your
vacation
and you know that's that's when things
start to heat up with that girl you were
scoping out
again i have no idea how that works in
real life but
hypothetically you still want to sort of
look the part so be careful about that
rebound i would hate to tell you guys
all this
and then rip you off you go to mexico
and you blow up like crazy damn it dr
mike set me up for this
all right lastly mini cut
follies unfortunately these are all too
common
okay people oftentimes that are drawn
too much too many cuts are at the end of
the day what we call fat phobic
they're just really scared of fat that
makes them really uncomfortable they
don't have like right now i'm like i'm
not particularly lean you know i got
some some stuff going on that's all
right i'm in a mass phase
i was pretty lean when i did you know
contest well
at the time of this recording this would
be recently uh when you guys see this i
don't know it'll be like three years
from when i did a show or something
but um you know it's okay not to be
super shredded all the time
here's the thing a lot of people don't
feel that in their heart
they hate body fat but they also want to
be jacked so what they'll do is they'll
do a mass phase for like six weeks
the slightest bit of body water
accumulates and a little bit of fat and
like chit chat chit chat and they start
mini cutting and they do a six week mini
cutter some crazy shit
and it'll take them right back where
they were body fat wise
and muscle wise that very lean
physique is relatively antithetical to
muscle
gain and i know that's crazy but it's
been confirmed by a few studies now
there's good theoretical reasons to
confirm it
especially if you're a drug free athlete
if you're not taking injectable
testosterone
then your hormone levels your
testosterone levels when you get super
lean
plummet when you're trying to gain mass
away from that you gain a lot of body
fat until you have enough body fat to
produce more testosterone levels and
then you start gaining most of your
muscle after that
if you're staying too lean all the time
and using many cuts to do it if you're
mini cutting more than your mass gaining
you're not mass gaining you just have
some body issues that
it's totally cool we all have them to
some extent you got to work through that
shit
and not get stuck in this trap right and
a lot of people don't want to mask for a
really long time
but other people want to mask for
forever and use mini cuts to get them
back down and mini cut mini cut mini cut
and they think that lasts forever the
thing is you accumulate too much fatigue
that way
mini cuts do reduce fatigue a little bit
but not completely
so your level of fatigue got a master go
like this mini cup would bring it down
then like this
right i'm scooting that slide over to
keep going then like this then like this
so yeah it does bring it down
temporarily it buys you this little
window here
but it's not an infinite window
eventually you know 17
23 or whatever 30 weeks later of massing
and mini cutting
your fatigue and resistance hypertrophy
through training volume
is really really high and there's many
cuts can't do that anymore
what you have to do is a real serious
legit cut
and then after that or like what i mean
by that is a six to 12 week cut
really reducing body fat and
you have to do probably after a two to
four week maintenance or active rest
phase
so that you're really really recovered
significantly leaner something many cuts
can't get you
and really reducing training volume your
sensitivity is up and then you have
you can continue massing afterwards okay
mini cuts don't just buy you infinite
massing i wish they did
i wish you could just mask mini cup mask
mini cup forever but it doesn't work
you need longer low volume training
breaks every now and again paired with
longer diets usually
number two mini cup folly mini cutting
outside the rate duration bounds
uh the quote here is play stupid games
win stupid prizes
i've seen a lot of people do this where
they're like i'm mini cutting i'm
cutting myself down to like
1200 calories a day and then three weeks
later the mini cup was supposed to be
five weeks three weeks later they quit
because their training just went
straight to shit they're not sleeping
anymore
they're starving and it's like okay i
wouldn't exactly call this productive
the fatigue is super high
there's a reason we have these
recommendations because we think they're
good ideas can you marginally move away
from them and explore that topography
and see
if you can do more aggressive or less
aggressive absolutely
start in the middle be intelligent about
it don't just you know you're not the
first person
to think that oh man 1.25 per week fuck
that i'm going to do 2
you're not the first million people to
think that so don't do that
because it's probably a stupid idea
there's a chance there's one in 20
that it works well for you i don't bet
one in 20 i don't put out my money for
120 chances you probably shouldn't
either right
and lastly thinking mini cuts are
magic super common okay there are no
shortcuts with many cuts
just trade-offs that are particular for
a good for a certain situation right
it's like i'm about to make an analogy
way outside of mayor of expertise so
hopefully it holds up
it's like uh what kind of motor oil to
buy okay there are certain brands that
are high quality certain brands that are
cheap and low quality but notice that's
still a trade-off
the low quality balance is still cheaper
there is a benefit there you have to
spend less money
but of the high quality brands there's
no like one that's like for sure this is
the best one
you know you say race cars use this one
isn't it the best look uh a person who's
you know knows cars and knows motor oil
be like
he gets the best if you have a high
performance car
but in a low performance car it's going
to some combination not do
the best job for your car or just be
totally needless and way too expensive
i think people look at mini cuts just
like they look for magic motor oil or
something like that
they look at it and they're like oh
that's it mini cuts it's all the
benefits of cutting except none of the
costs
that's total bullshit okay if if the
mini version of the diet appeals to you
that much because you can't stomach a
long diet
because you're either too impatient or
too diet fatigued you gotta deal with
those two things instead of leaning on
many cuts in a way they can't hold up
because they will collapse
and then you just won't get a lot out of
it and you're back to square one folks
thank you for tuning in see you next
time leaner
