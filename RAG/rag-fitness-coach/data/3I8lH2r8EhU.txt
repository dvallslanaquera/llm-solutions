so a lot of potential benefits with this
method i use it in my own training and
it's definitely something to consider
if you fit into any of those categories
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today we're going to be talking
about
one particular hypertrophy training
method that you can use
to build muscle effectively but in a
much more time and energy efficient way
now i talked about rest pause training
in a previous video
which is a technique that i'm a big fan
of and i personally use quite a bit in
my own training
and this method here is a form of rest
pause and it's called
mile reps so let's go over what mile
reps are
why they're effective how to implement
them the right way
who should specifically use them and i'm
also going to give you an actual
demonstration of myself performing a
mile rep set in
the gym if you're new here and you're

so what is a myo rep set it's actually
pretty straightforward
and it's where you perform a regular set
but using a slightly higher rep range
and then rather than taking a full rest
period and then performing an entirely
new set like you normally would
instead what you're going to do is just
take a very short rest perform a few
more reps
take another short rest perform a few
more reps and you're just going to
repeat that
for four to five of these additional low
rep mini sets and i'll explain
uh in a minute here exactly how to lay
this out in terms of the actual
rep ranges and the rest periods now why
would you do this well
uh like we've talked about many times
before on the subject of
training effort it's crucial to
understand that it's only the last few
reps of a given set
when you're up near the point of
muscular failure it's only those last
few
really difficult uncomfortable reps
those are the reps that are responsible
for triggering significant muscle growth
because those are the reps that are
actually challenging the existing
strength capacity of
the muscle okay the easier reps before
that they don't give your body any
incentive to change
because the muscle already has more than
enough resources to complete those reps
that's why they're easy
it's only when you threaten the existing
capacity of the muscle that your body's
gonna say okay
this is a real threat here and we need
to make some adaptations in order to
deal with it you'll probably get some
growth stimulation once you reach
around four to five reps shy of failure
but it's not gonna be that significant
at that point
uh it's usually gonna be around three
reps in reserve where something
actually legitimately meaningful is
gonna happen in terms of muscle growth
and more like
zero to two reps in reserve that's where
the most significant growth is going to
be triggered
so the idea behind myo reps is that
you're maximizing the efficiency of your
training
by reducing the number of junk reps that
you're performing and just focusing in
on those high quality muscle building
reps
up near failure now you're going to find
slightly different mile rep variations
in terms of the exact rep ranges and the
rest periods and the set counts
but i'll just give you the general
framework here so again you're first
going to start off with an initial
activation set i don't get the wrong
idea based off of
the terminology because activation set
almost sounds like it's a warm-up or
something but
that initial set is not a warm-up um you
should just treat it like you would any
other
normal muscle building set now you don't
necessarily have to go all the way to
failure
um you can go to failure if you want but
just perform that set using whatever
intensity level
you're aiming for based on your own
training approach whether it's all the
way to failure or
uh one rep in reserve or two reps in
reserve and so on um and the rep range
for that initial set should be slightly
higher usually it's gonna fall somewhere
between
about 12 to 20 reps now personally i'm
not a big fan of
really high rep sets because i think a
lot of times people
end up stopping the set not because
they're truly close to actual mechanical
muscular failure
but instead they just stop the set
because the overall general discomfort
level gets too high in terms of
muscle burn and cardiovascular stress
and even psychological stress
so i like to keep to the lower end of
that but that's just me
if you prefer higher reps you can do
higher reps but around 12 to 20 reps
would be standard for that initial set
now after the initial set you're gonna
take a short rest
uh the usual recommendation is three to
five deep breaths or around 10 to 15
seconds
uh the precise rest period is not some
critical factor but the main thing is to
just try
to keep it consistent each time so that
you can properly track your progress if
you are using mile reps on a consistent
basis but after that short rest
um you're gonna pick the weight back up
and perform your first mini set and the
mini sets are usually somewhere between
about three to five reps so do that take
another rest do another three to five
reps
and then just repeat that until you've
performed four to five of those little
mini sets
and with that approach what you're doing
is you're condensing a very high number
of effective reps
down into a shorter period and you are
optimizing the stimulus to fatigue ratio
because you're performing way fewer junk
reps in total and now let me show you
what an
actual mile rep set looks like from my
own training i just filmed this
during my last workout on my iphone so
the quality isn't great
um and this is just on a basic machine
preacher curl so
here's the initial activation set i was
aiming for 12 reps but i ended up
getting 11.
um i don't actually do this exercise
regularly at the moment so i wasn't sure
exactly how much weight to use but
i just had to find a quiet spot in the
gym where i could film because it was
pretty busy
but this was definitely a zero rir set i
for sure was not getting another rep
there
so after that initial set there's a
short rest because i went all the way to
zero rar i needed a bit longer to rest
here so i was doing
five really slow deep breaths now here's
the first mini set of
three reps again you can do four reps or
five reps here but i prefer lower reps
so i'm doing three reps here and i
couldn't have even gotten more than
three here if i tried anyway
another rest period and then another
three reps another rest
followed by three more reps then the
final rest and then on
the last set here i only got two reps
because i was pretty wiped out at that
point so again just to be clear
the exact numbers in terms of the reps
and the rest periods
that's not what's most important here
it's more so just about the general
overall
approach of a higher rep set followed by
several lower rep sets with shorter rest
in between and where you're going
close to or all the way to failure each
time so performing a large number of
effective reps
within a smaller window and if you want
to be even more efficient with this
uh one method that i personally use
sometimes as far as i know i thought
this up on my own maybe it has been
recommended somewhere else but
if so i'm not aware of it but the other
thing to keep in mind is that you don't
even necessarily have to do
a high rep activation set you can do
what i would call a
myo rep drop set where you can use a
heavier weight for that initial set for
a slightly lower rep range
and then just lighten the weight and use
that lighter weight for those additional
mini sets
um again i personally prefer training in
more moderate rep ranges
so what i might do is perform that
initial set with a heavier weight in
maybe the six to eight rep range take a
short rest and then do the additional
mini sets for three to five reps each
but just using a slightly lighter weight
but regardless of which exact method you
use
why would you bother with my reps in the
first place there's a few reasons
the first and most obvious reason is
that it's just more time efficient so
depending on your current situation if
for some reason you need to get in and
out of the gym more quickly
uh then obviously it would be useful for
that um that doesn't mean that you have
to do your entire workout using mile
reps for everything
um one option could be maybe to do your
compound movements using regular
straight sets
and then do your isolation exercises in
a mile rep style
or maybe for a particular muscle group
maybe for the first two exercises you do
those using regular straight sets
and then on the last exercise you do
milo reps um it doesn't have to be an
all or nothing thing
but it's just something that you can mix
in here and there to make your training
more efficient overall
aside from efficiency if there's a
certain muscle group that you want to
bring up and you want to increase the
overall volume for that muscle
then myo reps can be useful for that as
well um instead of doing maybe
let's say six extra weekly sets for your
upper traps you could do
one mile rep set and get a similar
training effect but without having to do
six completely separate sets
my reps could also be helpful if you're
in a situation where you don't have
access to heavier weights so if you only
have
enough resistance to where you need to
be doing let's say
25 reps per set in order to get close to
failure
you probably would prefer not to have to
do a really large number of high rep
sets like that so in that case
um you could do your initial set for 25
reps
take your quick rest and then crank out
a bunch of lower rep mower up sets
in order to get in all those effective
reps without having to completely reset
and do another 25 reps every time
if you've got a minor injury that you're
trying to work around then mile reps can
also be applicable
in that situation let's say you've got a
slight issue with your lower back
and the only way to work around it is by
doing high rep
lighter weight leg presses but again you
don't want to be doing let's say
a bunch of 20 rep and 30 rep sets that
are going to fatigue the hell out of you
and nauseate you and make you crazy sore
so again you can do that initial
lighter weight set for higher reps and
then do the rest in a mile rep style
so that you're still lifting that
lighter weight but you're getting to
failure
more efficiently and beyond all those
things you could just do my reps because
you enjoy them you know you just like
doing them and so on some exercises some
of the time you use mile reps instead of
straight sets there's really nothing
wrong with that either
so a lot of potential benefits with this
method um i use it in my own training
and it's definitely something to
consider
if you fit into any of those categories
and the only final point that i'd make
here is that
milo reps are probably more of an
intermediate and beyond type of
technique
i like to see novices build up their
overall base using more traditional
methods
you know basic free weight exercises
using regular straight sets
and then branching out from there if you
want to get a solid program for that
then you can visit shawnell.com custom
just fill out the short form there and
i'll send you back a free step-by-step
training routine that you can follow
based on your current condition and your
goals as well as a free nutrition plan
as well the link for that is up here
as well as down in the description box
but technically you could do my reps as
a novice if you implement it properly
and you really know what you're doing
but overall i would say that it's more
geared towards somebody with
some reasonable lifting experience under
their belt and then
secondly you probably want to be doing
this on let's say mechanically simpler
exercises
so i wouldn't recommend doing mile rep
squats or mile rep deadlifts or romanian
deadlifts or
you know free weight dumbbell presses
where you have to kick the weights up
into position
you can still use it on compound
exercises but if you're going all the
way to failure
then you want to choose movements where
there's less margin for error
and where it's easier to get the lift
into position and for isolation
exercises
i might say any isolation movement is
fine uh to do mile reps on
so this isn't a technique that you must
use i'm not recommending that you go
ahead and replace all your straight sets
with my
reps but depending on your current
situation and your goals and your
preferences
it's definitely a viable tool in the
toolbox to consider
