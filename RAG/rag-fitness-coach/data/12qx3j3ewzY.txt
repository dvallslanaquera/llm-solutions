ugh
it might have been really zealous with
the 50 for week for week one
[Music]
[Music]
oh I forgot to open my mouth that's not
usually a problem with parties it's
definitely not here's the thing
parties aside which I've never been to
I've read books about them
we're gonna have a real party today
because Mr Jared feather ifb Pro is
going to guide you guys through a
workout for the whole back
that you can do with just one rack
do you like backs or racks better
comment below in any case I'm the fuck I
bought it here because I'm gonna be
doing my own training but your boy gonna
slip into the scene every now and again
like I do
what do you think we'll go Mike out of
here so I can talk about what I'm gonna
do
[Music]
so generally squat racks do have this
bar here for Pull-Ups
um if they don't what I would suggest is
setting this make sure you have a lip
don't have a squat rack that doesn't
have a lip setting these as high as
possible
and you can put the bar up there and you
can use that for pull-ups instead if
this car doesn't have this but since we
have one I'm going to use the actual
parallel bar that is on this beautiful
squat rack but I'm actually doing a
horizontal emphasis pool day today
pool day not pole Mike Israel
um
so because of that I'm going to do these
pull-ups first and I'm going to show you
guys a good way to warm up
four pull-ups without a pull uh pull
down machine because obviously for this
session we just have a squat wreck
uh I have to do pull-ups first because
if I do all my horizontal pulling I'm
not going to be able to do very many
pull-ups at the end of the session so
generally my session would be most of my
horizontal pulling if I'm trying to
emphasize the horizontal pulls that day
and then I'll do some sort of pull down
or something at the end again doing
pull-ups first because I will get like
five if I don't do that so I'm going to
show you guys a good way to warm up for
pull-ups if you don't have the pull down
then I'm going to go into my pull-up
sets and then I'll go into my rowing and
stuff like that so I'm going to put this
parallel bar obviously you probably have
something you can stack up here but
again I'm trying to use as little
equipment as possible for you all this
is going to be how I warm up for my
pull-ups my foot's gonna go here
I'm going to kick myself up on the bar
and then do ecentrix basically so first
I'm going to do a couple dead hangs
uh stretch the lats out a little bit
then I will
show you how I place my foot up here
kick myself up and then uh do ecentrix
oh my God the spider webs in this
fucking place guys first things first
I'm gonna do some dead hangs here
kind of
retract
and I'm gonna do some depression of the
scapula
foreign
two three rounds and then I'm gonna go
into the Eastern trick
pull up I'll probably do like two or
three of those
then I'll potentiate with one or two
regular Pull-Ups
and then I'll go into my sets
so really just depends on how warm you
feel or how much warming up you think
you need for your pull-ups like the
specific warm-up
um
and if you can do regular Pull-Ups
if you can't do regular pull-ups you can
stop at e-centric pull-ups where you're
kicking yourself up
and you lower for a good three to four
seconds
so you would basically stop at this next
part of the warm-up that I'm doing
and that could be your vertical pulling
for the day for your pull-ups also
I mean it's not ideal but if you have
bands for assistance you could
definitely do that be safe when you get
up here guys okay it's gonna be very
scary I'm professional at this I don't
even got to use sport mode so
you could probably put this a little
lower so that way you can actually just
kind of kick up
again if you're going to do this
for your final warm-up you can just do a
couple
that'll be your potentiation
for me
that's my last warm-up before I go into
my Pull-Ups or before I go into my
potentiation stuff for my Pull-Ups so
if you're doing eccentric Pull-Ups for
this session
that's your final warm-up which is your
potentiation set so you do two or three
of those
and then you can go into it next and do
sets of 7 to 15 or whatever another
exercise option Jared's not going to do
this one he's just going to show you
some other stuff today is it's
definitely possible
you got to work The Kinks out and get
this thing uh the proper width and
everything like that but you can do a
variation of lat prayers with these
where basically you swing down and you
swing up now you'll have to adjust the
height of this thing but essentially
what you can do is it all comes down to
foot position but if you can get some
kind of lat prayer function going
especially at a higher angle then it
could be a good thing another thing is
if you're much stronger
this is a real challenge
so
the weaker you are the higher the bar
goes for these sort of lat prayers if
you're very strong
I'm sure shit not this strong
so I'll do a fake demo
but basically you start off here and you
essentially you're gonna lap pray
all the way down and all the way back up
but you'll be leveraged here so it'd be
like this you come up and you come down
go down and come up and Big Stretch and
come up and if you get all your foot
positioning right it can be intense it's
going to require a lot of figuring out
your foot positioning it's definitely
not ideal you would prefer this
Implement actually move but you can do a
lot with that if you put in some time
oh next one will be a full set
seven to ten it's really all I'm gonna
be able to do getting a little heavy
post contest so
17 rep range for the Pull-Ups
and then I will go into my rows and then
an inverted row intensity technique
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
six it is
oh have you got a pump though that's
nice
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh six again
foreign
next exercise we're going to be doing
the barbell bent over row going into my
horizontal pulling stuff
I'm gonna do
just regular bent Row from the floor
using 45s you can do all kind of forms
of this you could stand on the plate for
a deficit
just put 25s on to do a 25 then overall
I'm gonna stick to regular bent rows
today
uh three sets here as well before I go
into the intensity technique which will
be an inverted row which I'll set up and
explain how all that works
but just to 10 to 15.
three sets
barbell bent over rows yes I'm outside
of the Squire wreck but I still buy it
my ass is gonna be
in the squat wreck
and the bar is going to be out here okay
guys
it's still still one squat rack one back
attack
there happens to be all this stuff
with like
isolating the muscle
to an excessive degree
and not pulling in specific planes and
wrapping the elbow around the rib cage
all this
over emphasis of really
minute
probably not important detail
this workout is actually Pro like
how I trained for the first probably
eight years of my career
I focus very heavily on just doing
compound movements
pull-ups bent rows deadlifts shit like
that
so when you see all these guys doing
super ultra Advanced Techniques
you should probably be asking yourself
how they got there and not what they're
doing currently
because when you're Advanced some of
that shit matters
but when you're beginner intermediate
stages
this shit works and it's going to
continue to work and over the course of
time you'll find your Technique and it
works even better as an advanced athlete
so I still am heavily centered around
like 75 80 mostly heavy compound stuff
throwing isolation shit in there
so if you are doing stuff like this at
home and you feel like oh I'm so limited
on equipment I'm not going to get as big
as I can
you're gonna get 80 of the way there I
promise this is if you can get your
Technique down
and you have access to shit like this
you're fine and you're not behind the
curve whatsoever Home Gyms are fucking
awesome you can always buy a cable
station if you need to but this stuff's
awesome
[Music]
you learned some stuff in school okay
we're in the real world I agree this
shit is
it's real and you can't think your way
out of this one no fucking Harry Potter
nerd bullshit bro
this is fucking War you're combining two
separate mentalities oh I got you you're
being a hardcore bro but like with the
ultra Advanced this stuff sucks
because the Bros would love this shit
right yeah
yeah but you you don't love it I'm smart
bro you're smart bro you're cool though
thank you there are two types of down
sets that I actually program for clients
one
is when they fall at a rep range for the
top sets
um just to stay Within
no specific rep range like I said 10 to
15.
that was nine on set one
so I'm already out of it
and the other downset is to
intentionally
reduce load to go into a new rep range
for like
metabolite sequestration
so if I'm doing seven to ten at first
and I dropped the load by like 20 to get
into that 15 to 20 range
so I'm going to go ahead and do down
sets
because I fell out of the range so
probably take off like
30 pounds or something
[Music]
oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
Jared's catching a flight he's sitting
in the waiting area I'm not working on
his computer they're like passenger
Jared feather you've been upgraded to
business plan business class please
receive your ticket he said
Jared feather
five minutes later that's fucking the
students all right
Jared feather ifbb Pro he's like oh
thanks man of course
so the next exercise
I'm going to put these bars through here
these little beams
and I'm gonna place this on top of them
the higher up it is the easier it is
it's gonna be an inverted row
lower it is the harder it is
because I'm using this as an intensity
technique obviously that's generally
machine based stuff
so I'm going to make it easier
because I'm going to be doing either
giant set or my rep sets I wrote
something down because I'm going to
continue with these sessions since I'm
doing them
for week one I'll continue with these
for the rest of this master cycle um
so I'm either doing giant sets or micro
sets I'll come back and tell you
um
so it's going to be a little higher
if you're doing this for added work or
downset work from your bent over rows
you can put it lower
you could put a weight on you you could
wear a weighted vest whatever you want
to do more barbell rows is probably
better but I'm going to put it about
right here
and do my inverted rows
by placing this barbell over the top so
I'm look it's going to be a giant set if
it's a total reps
I'll try to rest as little as possible
kind of like with my push-ups when I do
giant sensor push-ups
giants has to really an insensy
technique we're kind of trying to
increase the Reps and not really have to
worry about what you're getting per set
you're just making sure by the end you
get the total number of reps but if you
want to add in a little flare you can
reduce the rest periods and that makes
it even
even more painful
so I'm going to probably rest at Max 30
seconds between my pauses and try to get
50 total reps on this first week next
week over 55
Etc
so
I'm gonna get to it don't really want
too much get a bunch of bit over rowing
and Pull-Ups so we're ready to go
[Music]
[Music]
for me this is generally
an intensity technique I might do with
like a
CD cable row
or chest support deflection row with
lighter weight
but
I had an inverted Rose in a long time so
I'm actually getting a really good pump
[Music]
oh boy
foreign
pump huh uh actually my lats are pretty
fucking I'm trying to tuck my elbows a
little bit I'd have been fucking
really zealous with the 50 for week for
week one
foreign
what you guys happy you happy you got a
whole back workout and just one power
rack good good
expense of my entire massive cycle
selfish she asked me look a lot of a lot
of you guys training uh just like a
power rack at home this is a sweet
workout and remember if you vary grip
widths if you have a couple of different
kinds of bars you vary the heights here
you vary the order of exercises that's
kind of a ton of workouts you can do in
each one of those you do once you know
for like six to eight weeks at a time
progress through a couple of massive
Cycles when you stall or it feels not so
great switch some grip widths switch
some bars around switch some orders of
exercises switching rep ranges up and
then you just got kind of an Infinity
amount of work to do in here yeah again
it's
literally exactly what I did for the
first probably eight years of my
training
heavy compound shit I really didn't use
too many machines
the assistant pull-up's a nice addition
if you can get that into your garage gym
outside of that I really heavy compounds
were the way to go for me so you're
getting
quite a bit of stimulation you're
probably going to be 80 of their way
there with your physique if this is all
you have
[Music]
hey guys
Jared feather here this is a really
terrible impersonation no I know brother
