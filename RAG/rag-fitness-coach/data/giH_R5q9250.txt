all right what's going on guys
today i'm going to take you through the
only at-home workout that you really
need
to make the best possible gains right
from the comfort of your own home you
don't need
any equipment so anyone can take part
and without any further ado
let's get started up first we're going
to start with some bicep curls
and because we don't have any dumbbells
we're going to make use of gallon milk
jugs now most people i've seen doing
these on instagram have been making the
beginner's mistake of just using
one jug per hand but you're definitely
going to find it much more effective to
use at least two or three jugs per hand
really whatever you can hold on to to
maximize the amount of weight on the
biceps and if you really want to take
these to the next level
you can unscrew the cap of one of the
jugs and take sips in between curls
according to reputable online sources
sip curls are one of the most efficient
exercises for repairing biceps muscle
damage precisely as it happens with
instant amino acid supply coming from
the milk
now you also don't want to make the
common mistake of unscrewing all three
jug caps which will
admittedly allow for quicker consumption
of amino acids and faster muscle repair
but can be sort of uncomfortable for
some lifters okay up next we're going to
do some suitcase rows for the back
now some people have seen doing these
have been filling up the suitcase with
clothes
and just do more or less regular rows
with good form but this simply isn't
going to overload the back well enough
so i prefer to fill up the suitcase with
bricks rocks really anything you've got
kicking around
that resembles what you want your
muscles to look like if you fill up your
suitcase with soft clothes you're going
to build a soft physique
if you fill up your suitcase with hard
rocks you're going to build a rock hard
physique
and again pretty standard rose here but
feel free to pull with your arms a
little more than usual to help hit the
biceps
since your back itself has already
gotten a good amount of stimulation from
loading all the rocks in now i've also
seen a lot of people doing legs from
home
and honestly i think this is an area
where a lot of people make the most
mistakes however it is a bit more
complex
so we're going to come back to the legs
here in a minute okay so up next we're
going to do something a little bit
different
one thing i haven't seen many people
doing is utilizing their bathtub
so what we're going to do next is turn
on the faucet and do curls against the
water's resistance
and according to several studies
hydrotension or hydra attention the
pronunciation can depend on the specific
make of bathtub
is a very simple and effective way to
challenge the muscle and it creates a
very smooth
feel-good contraction with a very
natural resistance curve
i mean the water literally is coming
from nature now one of the most common
mistakes that i see here other than
keeping the form
too strict is just going too light so
some trainees just won't turn the tap on
far enough so the water pressure is just
way too low and another common mistake
is using warm water you do want to use
cold water so it'll shock the muscle
better
and then it can double as a sort of cold
shower as well depending on how wet you
get now you could also do some leg
extensions and leg curls against the
resistance of the water but a lot of
trainees do find this to be a bit
awkward
um so we're going to come back to that
in a minute so after the tub faucet
curls we're going to do some overhead
press using
the shower attachment so pretty standard
overhead press here you want to use
an open palm to press against the water
coming from the shower head and if you
want to make these a little more
challenging you can use a dinner plate
to help create a larger surface area for
the hydrotension to work against
and if you did get hit with a few
splashes of water you can try eating
some tilapia
and that should dry you out pretty
quickly all right up next we're gonna
look at some ways to isolate the traps
now obviously we won't be doing the
traditional barbell
rack pull at home so we're gonna make do
with rack pulls instead using a rack of
ribs
so as the name implies you literally
just pull a rack of ribs apart and you
should see similar results as with the
traditional
barbell rack pull all right so after
killing our traps with those we're gonna
need to take our stack of toilet paper
rolls which should be hoarded in a
quarantine situation anyway if you're
not stacking toilet p
you're gonna be a weak trainee so you
want to take your stack of charmin
and use the toilet paper rolls as
makeshift plates that you can put on the
ends of a broomstick
and perform toilet paper cleans a lot of
people don't realize this but this is
actually where the name
clean comes from it's a reference to the
toilet paper
all right so all we've got left to do is
now hit some legs and i do want to get
to that but first i just want to take a
quick breather to talk about the
importance of diet during a pandemic so
in general a dirty bulking approach will
be the best approach
not only for muscle growth but also for
immunity and overall health
and that's because the more mass you
have the harder it's going to be for the
virus to get into your lungs with the
extra mass essentially crushing the
virus in its path
another important thing to consider is
boosting your immune system so you guys
know i'm a big fan of weiner smoothies
so if you take a pack of wieners you can
blend them up into a very nutrient dense
shake to help really beef up your immune
system pardon the pun
and i was going to cover all the leg
stuff i had planned but i think i'm
going to save that for
the next workout we do need to be really
careful not to over train especially at
this time when it's most important to
emphasize recovery make sure you give me
a follow over on instagram
bro jeff official leave me a thumbs up
and i guess i'll see you guys all here
next april fools
