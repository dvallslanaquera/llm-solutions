progression means that sometimes you
will need to put it all on the line but
that sometimes generally happens for
like the last week before your mesocycle
ends because it's the last cherry on top

for multiple weeks in a row and if you
can you're just doing not enough volume
each time you could be doing more volume
less psychotic failure training and
growing even more
