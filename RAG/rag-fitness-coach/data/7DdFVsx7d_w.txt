hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and today I have a public
service announcement for you for the
sake of the youngest people in our
society the children
stop drinking fruit juice and stop
feeding into your children Child
Protective Services where are you at
that kid has a Juicy Juice Box get Mom
and Dad out of the picture guess what
Junior you gotta go live in a beautiful
caring loving
day run orphanage
damn I started up pretty hard on that
I'll say it in a nicer way ban all fruit
juice now
go to city council man oh fruit juice
then oh fruit juice
and then you're like damn
social justice Warriors got really
carried away this time all right so real
talk just kidding fruit juices tasty and
totally cool to drink on many occasions
I just want to tell you guys that it has
some downsides I want you to think about
I know Fitness ruins everything
you can't even fucking have a glass of
orange juice on a fucking plane landing
in your own plane until your own airport
into your own City in London think about
that
without the stupid RP Dr Mike crap but
everything's bad for you
it's not that bad but check this out
first
fruit juice
is very high calorie but it's not
filling no one's like oh man I'm super
hungry like hey here's a can of orange
juice go oh thank God that really took
the edge off what you're like hey thanks
great uh when do we eat actual food
okay problem
got it
not filling
so if we are eating to try to control
our calories because we have trouble
maintaining because we have a history of
being heavier an hour later
or we're on a fat loss phase trying to
you know clean up the diet to lose some
fat lose some weight
shoes just doesn't have that bang for
the buck of how filling it is versus how
many calories
what does have the bang for the buck is
actual fresh fruit
it's Ultra filling yeah try this
yourself how many peaches can you eat in
a sitting until you're like I'm done
five six eight
it's ridiculous like how much sugar
enhanced peach juice sounds fuck good
can you drink in acidic I don't know
like a thousand calories worth it's just
the peeing is the part that's the most
problem
so fruit is filling and squashes hunger
it has fiber also which is good for you
in a bunch of other ways
so fruit juices
are like the fun tasting part of fruit
but without most of the benefits which
kind of blows
now if you say look hey Dr Mike let's
shut up for a second and hear me out I
like how fruit juice tastes because I
like sweet tasting things and I like to
drink sweet things with my salty things
totally cool but consider diet drinks
and diet sodas
drinks designed with artificial
sweeteners can squash that sweet tooth
and then you can take the calories that
you didn't eat from the orange juice
that you didn't drink
and put those daily calories into
something that will actually be filling
and tasty because I'll tell you this if
you have orange juice
or an orange flavored diet soda
both of those get you that orangey taste
and they get you the Sweet Tooth and
they get you the hydration
except one of them is like 160 calories
less than the other
you have a few of those drinks per day
you're up to five six hundred calories
of like
stuff you could just eat in food which
is more filling and honestly more fun
they say hold on a sec orange juice is
plenty fun to drink I love it yes but
you got the free fun from that diet
orange soda you already got the fun
super fruity taste with the with the
sugar and everything sugar the sweet
taste
and now you're just like doubling the
fun in other foods that are also more
filling have a fucking cookie
you could have a free cookie if you just
take the orange juice out replace the
shirt with diet
real talk that's that's the real deal
now
all that being said fruit juice is
totally fine you can feed it to your
kids you can drink it yourself
but especially if you want to be leaner
have an easier time maintaining or enjoy
more whole mouth feel food more but pay
no cost with the calories
consider reducing or replacing your
intake of fruit juice and either
drinking more other stuff like water or
carbonated beverages or diet sodas and
other diet drinks that just don't have
any of the calories but give you that
sweet fruity taste that uh the fruit
juice typically does give it some
thought let me know what you think in
