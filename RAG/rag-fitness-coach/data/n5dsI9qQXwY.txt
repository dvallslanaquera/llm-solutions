hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization welcome back to the
targeting the muscle series today's
exercise to help us target the side
delts more is the dumbbell lateral raise
we've got tips here we go tip number one
momentum
momentum is an okay thing
but if you are having trouble feeling
the target muscle
eliminating momentum or minimizing is
probably a wise idea so
a lot of lateral raising and there's not
a damn thing wrong with this
looks like this
a little bit of wiggle a little bit
momentum and that's totally fine but if
you're really having trouble feeling the
side delts because if you don't have
trouble feeling inside adults hey
rock away no worries
if you're having trouble feeling them
try to make sure that you control the
momentum on both concentric and
eccentric portions thus you start
sometimes not even from the front like
this but start here at the sides you
can't swing into it from here to this
you can do that start here
and only with your side delts raise
and then on the way down there's a
temptation to let momentum take over
don't do that raise with your side delts
slow on the way down
raise only with your side delt
intentionally slow not fast trust me the
 will catch up to you it'll burn
eventually slower on the way up only
side delts control eccentric on the way
down if you do that nine times out of
ten you will feel your side delts if
you're having trouble with them
next tip
degree of elbow bend this is a tip
that's one of those you can try a few
things and see which one works for you
but if you don't know to try them you
might be stuck in a pattern that's not
super great
one way to do the elbow position is to
completely lock it out it's pretty easy
to do standardized lock up with your
elbows and do the lateral raise with
elbows completely locked for some people
that makes all the difference they feel
their side delts a ton
for some folks it hurts the elbow it
feels kind of weird and it's no bueno so
for some folks they want to keep their
elbow just slightly out of luck locked
slight layer of lock like this and
sometimes it can feel a lot better so
play with both and see which one is best
for you
[Music]
next
ranges of motion
so there's not like one right way to do
the lateral raise there are plenty of
good options for folks with sensitive
shoulders if they give you a little bit
of trouble what you can do is allow a
raise to almost parallel if you control
no big deal you get a great shoulder
stimulus some other folks might try to
go all the way too parallel and back
down and that's totally fine if your
shoulders can take it that's probably a
little bit better there is another
version where you go to above parallel
and then you can get a really really
baller shoulder pump and everything
works out super great if your shoulder
joints can take it that's also good and
then of course there is the super rom
variant and which you go all the way up
and then control the eccentric and all
the way up and control the eccentric
that's not like better but it can
provide an awesome shoulder stimulus if
your shoulder jerks can take it just
know that there are options here's the
thing you have sort of two paths to go
one is you find the best one of these
that works for you and stick to that two
is you find that multiple of these work
really well but they're just sort of
different styles like rice versus whole
grain bread versus pasta and then you
know for a couple of months you do one
style for a couple of months to do the
other and now you have more variations
it's like having more exercise
[Music]
another thing you can try to get the
side delts to feel this a bit more is an
interesting modification
it turns out like the amount of force
relative to your muscle's ability to
produce it is really really low over
here and leverage wise it's much harder
over here so if you're losing a bit of
tension down here and you feel like this
is kind of junk volume what you can do
is limit the motion to a 45 degree range
at the bottom so let's say i'm doing
super round laterals and i'm coming all
the way up here i can come down to
roughly 45 and then go back up i'm still
in a really productive range and there's
no time during this movement when my
delts are not active this doesn't mean
it's a better way to do it but if you're
struggling with my muscle connection you
totally can even if you just go to just
about parallel you can go from here
to here just like that there's no damn
thing wrong with that but dr mike what
about stretch under tension now the
thing is with lateral raises it's not
really possible because when you have
the stretch you don't have tension
gravity doesn't point sideways
so if you want stretch under tension you
got to use cables or something like that
but if you're really having trouble
stopping at about 45 degrees and going
as high as here or even higher totally
great variation
[Music]
next tip is to play around with hand and
finger position so
many people can feel the side delts more
if they do them pinkies up so pinkies up
pinkie's towards the sky like this not
like all the way up but just a little
higher than your thumbs however for some
folks that's not really good for their
shoulders so for them they want to
experiment with putting their thumbs up
more and then they do it like this a bit
more front delt activity this way but
nonetheless you can't hit the side belts
well and of course there's conventional
straight so there's three different ways
pinkie's up straight and uh and thumbs
up try all three see which one works
best for you if your shoulders are
golden you can use these as three
different variations potentially if your
shoulders are not golden one of those
eliminate whichever ones they're not
golden and do the one that works best
all right last tip
sometimes if you're really struggling
with a mind muscle connection pauses can
help but these are pauses at the top not
at the bottom just a variation for you
to try so instead of doing this
which is 100 fine that's what i do most
the time you can pause i would pause at
mechanically the hardest position or
close to it so
pause
hold for one second
down slow
pause hold for a sec down slow
when you're pausing you really need to
activate your side adults to keep that
movement in the air that can enhance
your mind muscle connection you can feel
the target muscle more huh
 video series is titled that
and you can finally have huge side belts
try to walk into a door
the door frame breaks and you're the
hulk congratulations folks like
subscribe uh comment do youtube things
if you have an exercise you want us to
talk about break down to tell you how to
target the muscle better let us know in
the comments i'll see you guys
you
