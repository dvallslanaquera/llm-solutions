hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization and
strength training made simple video
number six
you want to check out the other videos
we already have them loaded in the
playlist before
how many sets should you do in order to
maximize
strength adaptations let's find out so
first question
is how many sets per movement per
session like how many sets of pushing or
bench pressing
or squatting per session so if you come
in
you have to do some squats how many sets
of squats is maybe too few
maybe too many and what's that sort of
right golden amount well
on the low end you want to do enough
number of sets
to drive the best strength adaptations
now it turns out
that you can have a pretty high
frequency of training and only do
as little as one hard working step per
session
and get really great results so at least
one heavy working separate session
is totally fine now on the other hand
as you train for weeks and weeks and
weeks
eventually you should hit your maximum
recoverable volume
of volume that you are working so hard
at that you can't recover from any more
than that and you actually underperform
if you go in excess of that
that means maybe you just do one
saturday time but you can train for
12 weeks on end and then the fatigue
comes down and crushes the units too
much or
you go from one set all the way up to
four or five sets and then only four or
five weeks later
that's too much volume because the
fatigue catches up and the volume is
rising and then it's too much
so you definitely want to train enough
to first of all do at least one hard
working set duh not really an answer
and two to challenge yourself towards
the end of your cycles
essentially if you're deloading when you
still feel great and you still feel like
you could do more work
you could probably have been doing more
work so if someone says again i only
ever trained one set per session
someone's like have you ever tried
training with two
like yeah that would be too much how do
you know
i don't well maybe you try trading with
more because
you could you know more sets is more
stimulus and potentially more strength
gain and all the actual formal
literature
it's very hard to get the best
adaptations from just one working set
per session there are some exceptions
but usually more working sets per
session like two three or four
is better it just makes you stronger
faster or makes you more stronger so
give that some thought now
you say okay one is good two might be
better three might be better for
you better where's the top end for that
clearly this such a thing is too much
here are some answers first of all if
you are
developing muscle size for strength okay
not just for its own sake like
bodybuilding
but getting the muscles bigger to make
them stronger later we're primarily
going to be training with sets of five
to ten
and the most productive loading range
for that
is things above 75 percent of your 1rm
so if you're doing squats and you're
doing set after set after set
and in order to continue to do sets of
at least five if you have to lower the
weight on the bar
to below 75 of your fresh one rep max in
a squat
you're doing too much work because then
all of those sets after
are so light that they're not really
creating the kind of muscle growth
that's best to make you stronger
it's what's called junk volume oh you're
training all right
but it's not really making you as good
as it could possibly be you're much
better off stopping training
switching to another exercise and other
muscle groups on and so forth another
lift
and or going home and just coming back
in a different session when you're more
fresh and putting in high
quality work the definition of high
quality work here is sets of 5
to 10 at least at 75 percent of your 100
max now
same kind of rule for basic strength
training actually getting strong sets of
three to six
you should be able to do with at least
82.5 percent or so
just an average figure of your one rep
max so if you're so
tired that you're doing seventy percent
of your 1rm for sets of three to six
you are not training for strength
anymore you're just training for moving
around
right that's probably not why you're in
the gym you're probably watching this
because you want to get stronger so keep
that in mind
so hard cut off is if you can't lift
sufficient amount of weight 82.5 percent
in this case for basic strength that's a
three to six
it's time to leave the gym it's time to
shut it down for you that might occur
after five sets it might occur after
three it might occur after eight
who knows but that's your answer right
there it's different for everybody
limit strength development when you're
talking about peaking strength sets of
one to three
if you're doing sets of one to three and
you're down because of fatigue because
you've done so many sets
to below about eighty seven point five
percent of your wonder at max
you're training too light it's no longer
limit strength it's just not a limit
weight anymore you're just tired and you
need to switch the lift or go home
or something like that now
another consideration for volume you do
a certain amount of volume certain
number of sets per session
and then you do another session another
session in another session
if you do so much volume in one session
that
your strength doesn't recover and adapt
to become greater in the next session
after
you've probably done too much so for
example if you do four sets of squats on
monday
and by wednesday you do again four sets
of squats except now you're stronger in
the squat
all as well and that four sets of squats
is not too much but if you've done eight
sets of squats on monday
and wednesday you're so beat up from
squats that you're actually a little bit
weaker
or just about the same you're violating
the core tenet of progressive overload
of strength training which is to make
things heavier over time that's the only
way to get stronger
duh so maybe eight's a bit too much if
you lower it to four
you can make those jumps you're not in
the gym for strength training to try to
beat yourself up as much as possible
you're there to get that great stimulus
and get out to set up the next
productive session
lastly if you have overlapping soreness
into sessions it's probably
too many sets so if you're doing eight
sets of bench press
and the next time you do bench press
your pecs are wildly sore your triceps
are sore
and you can't put out the kind of force
you're supposed to because soreness
interferes with maximum force production
and it risks injury considerably more
than if you're not sore
being that you're trained for strength
those are heavy loads you don't want to
be sore for your heavy loads
when that's the case it's too much
volume now we all have these napoleonic
big eyes that open up man
i could get so much better doing four
sets or six sets or eight sets
if you cannot recover which means you're
not stronger next time that you plan to
squat or bench or deadlift or whatever
and or if you're still sore volume is
that big thing we change
do fewer sets there is nobody around
counting your sets and be like oh you're
doing hey that's really good nobody
cares
some of the strongest people in the
world do two or three sets per movement
per session and they're
awesome it's just what you can recover
from and have
high quality workouts not just now but
the next time and the next time and the
next time
if you do too much volume at once you
could screw that process over and not be
able to build up like that
now to keep it simpler
sort of a four-point guide here if
you're not training
close to your heaviest it's not going to
make you much stronger so if you're
squishing in volume
but you have to reduce the load just to
be able to do sets of five
stupid idea so never do that number two
if you're training so much that you
can't hit a pr next session or next week
like a relative pr a little bit more a
little bit more a little bit more you're
training too much you should probably
consider training less
number three if you're training so much
that you're sore in the next session
repeatedly you're like yeah
trying to get stronger hamstrings doing
stuff like deadlifts i'm sore all the
time do not be sore all the time you can
get sore make sure your soreness heals
completely
by the time you train hamstrings again
that's a really good idea
and if after a whole mesocycle
progression of session to session
recession if you're deloading
but you could have still hit a pr if you
didn't deload
you're either not training for long
enough at a time you should delay your
d-load to later
or the average volume you're doing
number of sets every week
is just too low a d-load should come
when you cannot give any more
like that last workout you rack the bar
and someone's like we think next week
five more pounds on the bar same number
of sets you're like no way i will be
weaker next week
that's the case you earned your d load
if that's not the case
yeah i could probably go up either don't
deload continue to apply volume at the
same volume you were
or look back on your accumulation phase
and next time
do more because you want to push your
limits towards the end and volume is a
big way in which you do it
now what about total sets per session
not per muscle group
for example let's say we're squatting
and benching in one session so we
already know the answer is
whatever drops out of those uh weight
zones and whatever makes you too sore
and so on and so forth but what about
sort of everything that you do the total
actual session itself
so for any of the respective exercises
that you do or the muscle groups that
you train in the movement patterns like
squatting and pressing and so on and so
forth
if they fall below for hypertrophy for
strength 75
for basic strength 825 for peaking 87.5
then you're probably done okay now that
means
check this out you squatted first you
bench after
how many sets a bench well benching
is still compared to its fresh 1rm so if
you're doing basic strength for squats
that's a 3 to 6
then basic strength for bench sets a 3
to 6. that sets a 3 to 6 for benches not
adjusted rm wise like yeah
but like what's my 1rm if i've done
squats no no it's not an absolute scale
so your fresh bench 100m is what you
still compare it to
and if you can't move that for sets of
three to six at at least 82.5 percent
of your fresh one around the bench
you're done so if you're thinking right
now like wait a minute
that only means i might be able to do
two or three sets in the bench if it's
not a first exercise that is exactly
correct
which is why a lot of people are really
good at strength programs say you can
really only have
one main focus exercise in any one
session if you get sufficiently advanced
oh yeah you can squat bench in deadlift
in the same day but that deadlift at the
end
are going to be very few sets and
probably not that impressive as far as
rep range
because you are very quickly going to
have so much systemic fatigue
you're not going to be able to lift
heavy enough to count it as strength
training anymore
any much more than that is just junk
falling you're moving around not much is
happening
so if it's not heavy enough to sort of
at least be increasing your strength why
are you doing it
even if it feels heavy here's a real
crazy
mind warp for you if you're so tired
that your normal 20 rm in the bench
is something you know 60 of you on our
max if you're so tired that you're
benching it for such a three
and you're like it sets a three it's
strength training it's not
it's just fatigue training and it's
causing much more harm
than it is good so if you're not fresh
enough to perform at your top level
you're done which is why the vast
majority of the elite and the strength
world
have sessions that aren't that long and
they have many of them throughout the
week especially olympic weight lifters
either hit it fresh and hit it hard once
you fatigue
it's time to shut it down because that's
too much right
so if you can't hit a triple okay with
82.5 percent of your fresh 1rm
you're very fatigued you should probably
shut it down now
all this stuff is theory and i'm sure
you've put together a plan of like okay
it's about this many sets for me
and maybe i'll go to the gym and find
out let's just throw some numbers out
these are
reference values they're averages
they're not dogma they're not religion
just keep them in mind so you're not
entirely unmoored from reality when you
go try this yourself
movement sets per session like how many
sets of squats should i be doing per
session when i train for optimal
strength
usually between two and five cents if
someone's doing like six sets of squats
in one workout i'm like maybe they're
training more for hypertrophy and less
for strength okay
two between two and five is a good uh
estimate
for you to begin exploring probably on
the lower end of that and work up
as needed what about total session for
strength training work for that core
work yeah some accessory assistant stuff
maybe you can add towards the end but
it's questionable value anyway
for your core work in a session to make
you stronger or build the muscle for
strengths that's a five to ten
more than 15 total heavy work sets
is on that upper limit okay total for
the session
so if you do five sets of squats kind of
a strange workout five sets of bench and
five sets of deadlifts
think about that these are all hard
deadlifts these are all
hard squats hard benches this is not
including warm-up sets right but they
don't cut warm-up sets or all their own
these are working sets
how much more can you ask of yourself
than that and if someone's doing a whole
lot more if you tell me hey listen i do
30 work sets for strength per session
i'm going to tell you two things one
that's probably not optimal and two
would be more optimal
if you instead of 30 took 15 and 15 and
did more sessions per week
so for example if you're doing oh let's
say
you know three workouts per week and
each one is 30
sets per session maybe do five or six
workouts per week
and do like 15 each time and i almost
guarantee you
you'll have better results folks thanks
for tuning in see you next time for the
next video in this series
