welcome to a full day of eating video in
this video i'll take you through what i
eat day to day during contest prep
now
i'll just show you the finished product
so how i make those meals
but there will be a video on the way if
you're interested in how i make each of
those meals so stay tuned and i'll show
you that as well and without further ado
here's what i eat in a day enjoy the
video
so
one banana
250 grams berries
250 grams of fat for yogurt greek
one scoop of whey protein and five grams
of creatine monohydrate
and then i just add some water
and the finished product i have this
every morning keeps me full all right
welcome back so if the camera works with
shaky
it's because i think i'm currently
experiencing a um
hypoglycemic bound
and so
while i usually have pineapple
with my second meal i'm having it a bit
earlier
just to hopefully help with hypoglycemia
um
yeah so typically i'll show you now
i have around
200 grams of pineapple
with my second meal just because it's
fairly filling and has some carbs and
typically i had my second meal
around an hour and a half
after my first session of the day so my
am session
so that's why i have it
so meal number two
100 grams of
kellogg's crunchy nut
cereal
and 250 milliliters of lactose free
skim milk now this is have some carbs
and
that's pretty useful post workout
because i am
fell deep into prep and so recovery and
glycogen stores are both kind of shot
and so having some carbs post workout
especially after my am session
where i only have around maybe
six hours ish to recover before a pm
session
uh getting some carbs in post-workout is
quite important
all right meal 2 i use a rice cooker to
prepare my rice whether that's brown
rice
white rice
uh you can make like porridge slash oats
in it
so i prepared some brown rice which i'll
get out now
and i'll serve that up and add some
chicken
all right and here we are that's about
100 grams of brown rice some chicken
breast mushrooms bean sprouts
uh garlic onion black pepper salt soy
sauce
and that's it i
if you know anything about me i love soy
sauce
and so
i put it on a lot of my food it also
helps with making sure i get enough salt
in one deficit because often times when
you're deficit you consume a lot less
salt
and that can be a problem um
but yeah so that's my meal for now
that's meal number three in this case
all right so i just came back from my pm
session and now it's time for
meal 4 which is my post-workout meal
for my pm session uh so i'm making sure
i have some carbs in it and i'll show
you where it is all right so brown rice
around 100 grams and
a seventh of the bonniers recipe um
which is around 800 grams 900 grams
um
now the ratio of rice to borneos is a
bit messed up but ultimately
there's a lot of bond here so i can stay
full and manage my hunger
all right just about to have my last
meal of the day
and
i dare say this is the weirdest meal
you'll ever see in a what i eat in a day
of a deal
um
you want all of me
this is what you get
alright so first up
four eggs
egg white and yolk everything
with soy sauce okay
then
a protein shake
uh around half a quarter of a liter
and one scoop of protein
then a salad with uh
garlic onion pepper salt balsamic
vinegar
finally sauerkraut
now i promise there is a method to my
madness here it is
eggs they have cholesterol and some fats
i need some fats in my diet to meet my
daily fat requirements
and cholesterol there is some evidence
suggesting
having some cholesterol intake
might be beneficial for hypertrophy and
strength
and so getting some egg yolks in
daily is one easy way to do that
then the protein shake
i don't know it's tasty and
i like protein and it helps me meet my
protein requirements for this pre-bad
meal
for the pre-bed meal you want to make
sure you get enough protein in because
you won't be eating for quite a long
time so that helps
lactose free milk because i'm slightly
lactose intolerant so it helps with
gi issues
salad for tidy um low calories high
volume
good for micronutrients too
same with sauerkraut sauerkraut
specifically it comes in a jar it's
macro friendly
it's quite satiating it doesn't taste
great but ultimately
it's cheap it has a lot of volume and it
doesn't require preparation you just
take it out so
that's why i have it and that is the
most random meal you'll ever see
it's the meal i had in the evening
because before sleep i like to be quite
full and so having a lot of vegetables
helps me stay full
during non-training days where i have
fewer calories is i simply remove the
meal with the cereal
and the brown rice from meals three and
four and that way that drops me around
1100 calories which drops around
i want to say 250 grams of corpse for my
day
um
that way i can have higher calories and
carbs on trading days and lower calories
and carbs on non-trading days
to get a greater deficit across the week
while still maximizing recovery and
performance on those training days one
benefit of doing it that way is a it's
simple
and another one would be rice and cereal
don't contribute that much to society
compared to more voluminous foods like
vegetables so one thing you could do is
instead of having that rice and cereal
you could increase how many vegetables
you're having that day
so that overall you're still not going
super hungry on those non-training days
anyways that about wraps up this video
if you like the video please comment
like subscribe i'll make a video
detailing how to make those meals pretty
soon so stay tuned and i'll see you
again in the next video
