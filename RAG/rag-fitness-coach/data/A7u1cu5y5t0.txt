size literally causes strength and the
fact that if your muscle is bigger all
else being equal it produces more Force
because the physical muscle is what
produces the force it's like what causes
a race car to go fast the giant engine
has a lot to do with it like it
physically causes the car to move right
so you know if you got stronger you
probably didn't get smaller there are
ways to get stronger and get smaller if
you're neural and Technical adaptations
go up really high but your muscle goes
down just a little bit you can actually
get stronger than that balance but but
gee I wouldn't bet that that happened if
I'm getting stronger I'm feeling pretty
good about my muscle size
