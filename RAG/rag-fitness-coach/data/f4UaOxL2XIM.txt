God
ah I'll just let this keep going it's
too much good footage
[Music]
you too
like many people you and I know you
right there the viewer have two distinct
problems problem number one your arms
are too small
problem number two the amount of time
you have to train them is also small
and that's a big deal but it's nothing
we can't handle
myself an isbb Pro Jared feather
also known as the man with the biggest
arms of all time
Wikipedia that is I mean they're quite
big
for you they're the biggest all-time oh
sure that they've ever been right which
is great yeah happiness for you I guess
and we did promise that you're gonna do
get big arms fast but what we meant was
that this workout's fast and you can do
it and workouts like it and we'll talk
about principles in a bit and then you
can get the biggest arms you can get
genetically
while doing this fast
it's really weird life straight up click
bait we lied to you by taking two it is
called equivocation that's the logical
fallacy the fast was the workout to get
big arms was you will get something like
big arms doing our fast work up will you
get the big arms fast no no that shit
takes months years and uh We're not
gonna lie to you on this channel just in
the click bait I guess here's what we
have for you guys
Jared is only going to do
two
antagonistic supersets
bicep and tricep supersets just two each
one is going to have
how toasty you want to get four sets
that's a sum total of 16 sets of arms so
but in Rapid succession the actual
workout itself but for the fact that
we're going to be blabbing about
technique is gonna take cheese probably
like 15 minutes and if you have 20 or 30
minutes to spare about two to three
times a week you can do something like
this workout we'll talk about how you
can exchange exercises talk about it
right now you can do any kind of bicep
address of exercises and this way you
can smash arms get out quick
get to the little cafe down the street
where that one girl kind of looked at
you that one time you flashed those
shits at it just like that
um you're the girl I'm the guy flashing
it was I did the Big Arm RP big arm
workout now I'm like so
you see that shit you know shit's about
to get popping after that one two three
arms
all right folks first exercise combo is
cable curls
and again no particular attachment ah to
that bar yeah there's a little double
entender there uh whatever bar is comfy
I can't use this bar because I don't
have the mobility anymore Jared can
so this is going to be the first
exercise
pretty close to zero rest Jared's gonna
walk over after doing about gee whiz 20
reps there he's gonna go to Cable push
downs and do something like 20 reps
there wait about 30 seconds
and then hit this again
18 slow on The Descent
19. fuck yeah slow
super slow as if another
rack excellent excellent
push Downs you're going to be interested
in having your elbows move back for that
stretch as you come up as soon as it
hits your biceps you can stop here you
can continue here a little bit more long
head activation but that's not so
necessary again dealer's choice and of
course a smooth push down all the way if
you have to press it a little more if
you can do the arc it's all right
answers and you know what else is good
me shutting them huh just letting Jared
be beautiful
eleven keep going two more lucky number
13 let's go
my man
go
slow
shit yeah shit yeah now guys calling an
audible here you want to stay in that 10
to 30 rep range Jared do you want me to
lower the weight a little bit for next
time we're going to take like a 10 to 20
reduction Jared was at 120 for this
we're gonna take him down to 90. we want
15 to 20 reps on the next one to keep
that rep range where we want it he's
going about one zero to two reps in
reserve
um and I've you know I kind of I'll talk
to myself I think it's about 30 seconds
Jared hit it again
technique wise on this you're of course
doing all good technique not in this
crazy uh bullshit no swinging but you're
looking to take your pinkies and shove
them up into the sky as you move up and
you're looking to do the same thing with
the insides of your elbows you want to
show the insides of your elbows
to God
hello is that 10 11 rest a bit rest a
bit don't go anywhere curveball
we said 15 we're going to mire up our
way to that shit and you can totally do
this in these workouts you got short
time you got to hit it hard four more
Jared let's go baby
three hell yeah
big moves yes slow
fuck yeah
right into it 12.
I'm post contests these are good times
to do these types of short workouts are
when you're having a ton of intensity
techniques inside of your training in
like vacation periods post contest
periods times when you're limiting the
load like let's say you're on a cruise
you have like 50 pound dumbbells as the
highest it goes These are times when you
can really do antagonistic agonistic
super sets
push and
rest a bit finish the tube
full lockout
yes
shit
one more of these left I'm out of shape
you're gonna look out of shape
is this a doubt workout
my lungs are fucked
seven slow fuck yeah

three
[Music]
go slow
take a break oh yeah all right
Jared's gonna take a break and then we
have the next exercises let me Demo them
for you so you see what's in store
[Music]
first exercise in this second series
is going to be a dumbbell skull crusher
as noticed we did bicep curls as the
first exercise in the first series and
that's because we want to make sure
biceps get the due diligence and thus
the tricep set quality was much lower
here for the push Downs because Jared
was so tired after biceps every time
this time we flipped the script to give
due diligence to the tricep and make
sure this workout evenly hits everything
or roughly evenly another four sets here
of both and that's it hit it
deep
[Music]
beautiful come on
one two last one here take a pause one
whole second up yes back good stuff good
stuff let's go let's go let's go let's
go right into biceps lightweight here
Jared let's go 10 to 15 and then rest a
little bit four and you're done go

God damn it
ah I'll just let this keep going it's
too much good footage tell the camera
what you feel and why ah
there's an immense
burn
consulate metabolize
my forearms my biceps
my triceps
my front Felts a little bit from that
last bit
do you have a pump oh my God
pump out of this world
post contest stuff or on a cruise after
you get a shitload on the buffet
this is the type of pumps that you get
especially when you're doing intensity
techniques
so this is good I can't bend my arm all
the way down no way yeah I can't hit I
can't do like a front double right now
try it looks really cool wow look at all
those veins weird again I'm a fan of
agonistic super sets but that was fun I
actually don't do antagonist 60 sets
ever
so I'm sure there's some sort of novelty
that's imparted if you do something like
that you know
so maybe something to throw in
every like
other block of training so or all the
time if you want to save a shill at a
time right so all right got a pump yeah
get in get out
go uh take your shirt off and dance
around the cruise or whatever dancing on
the cruise folks if you're on a cruise
go talk to people everyone there to have
a good time if you want to do this
workout
it'll only take 20 minutes out of your
day
then you're back to partying it'll put
inches onto your arm that's for the
course of years that's the most
important part yeah inches on your arms
more important isn't just on something
else that's not this kind of channel for
that kind of stuff we'll see you next
time
[Music]
if we had a cruise one week Cruise
