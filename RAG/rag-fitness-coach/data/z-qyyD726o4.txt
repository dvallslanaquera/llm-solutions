Why is Sam Sulek doing half reps? Is this actually  
effective for muscle growth? Wouldn’t 
a full range of motion be smarter?
Actually, the latest science 
says Sam is onto something.
What he’s doing here is a technique 
called long-length partials,  
which is when you do partial reps with the 
muscle in its most stretched position. And  
it’s not just Sam – Ronnie Coleman did 
them. And, even though it wasn’t pretty,  
almost all of Branch Warren’s training 
involved long length partials.
As of now, there are 5 studies on long-length 
partials versus full range of motion:  
4 of them favored long-length partials and 1 study 
found no difference. No studies favored full ROM.
In my own training, I use them on my last 
set of pulldowns: so once I can no longer  
get the bar all the way down, I keep pushing 
with partial reps. Same thing on leg curls:  
once I can’t touch the pad to my 
glutes, I crank another 4 or 5 partials.
I’ve also been doing them on leg 
extensions from the first rep to  
the last rep and I’ve been trying them 
on leg presses and chest presses as  
well. Just make sure you still control the 
negative and you still push the set hard.
