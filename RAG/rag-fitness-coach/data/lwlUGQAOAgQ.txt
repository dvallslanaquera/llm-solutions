[Music]
oh my always throwing up
soft music to the sky
[Music]
yo YouTube
quick intros me I'm Dr Mike
back there my biological son
my firstborn my child my seed Mr ifb Pro
Jared feather
and we are joined today from Eastern
Canada if you believe that's a real
place I think it's still like Hogwarts
Mr ifbb Pro Johnny Shreve the YouTube
collab you've been waiting for you've
been asking for you've been begging for
he's here to show us how a real Pro
trains legs he's going to jump in for
our leg workout there will be pain there
will be suffering and there will be an
embracement
of one's ancestral Nigerian god-like
athlete genetics I'm talking about
myself of course oh Johnny what's up
how are you feeling I'm feeling good man
good I'm excited I'm good excited all
right same time
[Music]
every time you touch your butt with the
bar
or close that's good enough
and then a slow eccentric on the way
down and a full stretch at the bottom
yep the machine has to Clank at the
bottom and touch the bottom every time
Big Stretch on the hams
yeah there you go when you do your set
the stretch at the bottom being
controlled
do you emphasize both
like so I touch your butt what we like
to do is make sure that we're hitting
a standardized range of motion
and that means we have to physically
feel the touch of the bottom yeah and
feel the touch at the top or at least
get us close to the top as we can until
like limb ratio wise you're just unable
to touch your own butt that's totally
cool
um so that's where we're coming from but
absolutely both the concentric I like
explosive yeah The Eccentric I like
controlled to really milk it out Jared
what do you think yeah I think that
needlessly controlling that last bit of
the concentric might take away from that
part yeah so it's probably best for like
pretty forceful concentric yeah and like
you said standardized range of motion so
that's why we try to tap the ass yeah
and you might come out of that kind of
quickly because you're not used to that
position but as long as you can try to
control that switch from concentric to
Eccentric it's a good thing okay
and let's get two more
[Music]
eleven hell yeah
hell yeah there you go 12.
oh almost
come on let's go finish that ROM up slow
[Music]
yeah zero yeah
so going away not bad man I count 12
good ones I could even fit 150. or a
little less than one double sticker 170.
and hit all the 12th from now for the
rest pause good we are going to be doing
mile rep match my rep match first set
you go hard basically close to failure
this is my Peak wheat Jared's peak week
as well after your first set you get
normal rest it's up to you to repeat
that same sets of reps but you're
allowed to take little rest breaks in
the second set third set and fourth set
so if you get 15 reps on a first set on
your second set you get 13 Master
failure you stop you breathe five to ten
seconds you get another two that's 15
again next time you get ten then three
then two and so on with normal rest
breaks in between the big sets but the
little sets of a five to ten second rest
break
[Music]
I have like we explained it man my head
just like the math so basically rep uh
if you're like first set to failure
match those reps and rest pause but I
said it better translation
that's why I'm here help Translate
[Music]
yeah hell yeah
[Music]
come on
he's one of those athletic whites it's
rare but it happens it's got those
hamstrings
thank you
11. take your time with this one dress
it out a little bit
touch
oh zero
rested out a bit finish that last rep
just good stuff Johnny doing great
hit it up
yes slow control
and that's it
it's beautiful good stuff it really hits
huh it's like going to failure a whole
bunch right
good shit man
oh being called out oh with this yeah I
do stuff like this yeah so if you can
try to keep it in the hamstrings as much
as possible yeah or just try to limit
that yeah you'll throw a lot more in
your hands 100 yeah
Jared well that's just me Chinese our
guests be nice to guests you're doing
great you're doing everything perfect oh
I forgot that part it's supposed to be a
compliment first yep
[Music]
yeah
that's ten rest it out you're good
a little more two more two more
yep let's go slow
fuck yeah Johnny hell yeah
[Music]
oh yeah ah
way better good stuff
Christ's sake hack squat time hack squat
time
at squat time
[Music]
five sets of hack squats for me three
top sets heavy two down sets slightly
lighter
gonna warm up first good technique we'll
talk you guys through how everything is
set up here
and then after that we'll last set of
hacks ends with uh kind of a drop set of
just body weight squats on the squatting
wedge we'll clue that in when uh when we
have to pain time y'all gonna kill me
today
we're trying I know
it's like the rights of Passage or
something yeah
see this bodybuilder is not just talking
shit
if he's a meat eater
good set up Johnny
deep and strict
gentle pause
still warming it up nice and easy
oh yeah so we're warming up for the hack
spot
warming up especially for heavy leg
stuff
you got to take your time rushing it is
a very very bad idea you could get hurt
and honestly if you take your time to
warm up the actual work sets feel better
your Technique feels better feel
stronger
uh all your weird nagging injuries are
gonna feel better because they're going
to be warmer more pliable
so you definitely don't want to rush
this the way I warm up for this is
actually don't start hack squatting
until there's three plates on there I
know humble brag but what I do is I warm
up just 15 body weight squats and since
it's a completely vertical and I already
weigh 250
when I get on the hack spot some of my
weight is co-signed out trigonometry
wise and the three plates on there
actually feels like the next jump from
250. so I'm gonna get on there now and
I'm gonna do a set of eight at three
plates I'm gonna do a set of four to six
at uh five plates after that and then
I'm gonna try doing my six plate and
change for like two or three reps and
after that I'll be ready to go so we're
gonna take Johnny through warm up
similarly and then uh we'll be good to
go work set like let's go come on
come on
nice
[Music]
Dad yep that's it
[Applause]
let's go halfway let's go
come on
oh shit
let's go got four let's go
Jive up there you go
that's it come on
good
[Music]
all right
[Music]
easy now
[Music]
control the double bounce
nice pause
there it is
[Music]
control
let's go man there you go yep
[Music]
you guys will notice
I take a little bitty pause
Johnny takes a hefty pause
Jared isn't pausing he's just going to
full range of motion why
pause is not categorically better
than just doing full ROM in a controlled
pace
is an option it's a variation you can
use
it's a smart variation if you consider
yourself a little bit more at risk for
injury given a circumstance
but a lot of this comes down to personal
preference and personal fit
Jared doesn't prefer to pause versus not
pause but he has noticed over the years
that for him in some exercises including
this one pausing actually makes his
knees feel a little bit worse
but if he gently goes through that full
ROM his knees feel great
so you don't have to pause
it's just an option but if you're not
pausing think about pausing and see if
it feels better or worse and then go
from there at least one of us training
hard today
Joe my name's Flex Lewis this is me Jim
not yours
I don't care how strong you think you
are you come after my Lucky Charms I'll
fucking got you like a fucking fish last
set here for me Ben for Johnny then
we're done I'm gonna be doing a set of
13 here I did 15 with
five plates
we'll be doing a set of 13.
and then
transition right into a set of 20 body
weight squats
now because
the muscles are so fatigued
that you're just close to failure the
entire time you do that set of 20.
and it is brutal
I'll probably have to rest pause that
set there's no way I'm doing 20 right
away
I'm gonna have to stand around a bit
between reps
crank them so
I don't know who the hell writes my
program
it's a stupid idea stupid idea you can
fall like everybody else that's it don't
think about it entirely let's go that's
it that's it that's it turn hard Mike
come on that's it back down for you
let's go dig dig let's go come on come
