breaking through strength plateaus video
number two i'm dr mike israel for
renaissance periodization here we go
this video is focused on fixing plateaus
in your ability to get stronger through
addressing your nutrition relaxation and
sleep
so
why are these things important
here is the training process here's how
it occurs in roughly six steps
first you stimulate
gains essentially message gains to
potentially start occurring through hard
training
then you allow the muscles and nervous
system to enter a state of recovery
you properly supply energy and raw
materials for recovery and adaptation in
that state
you allow for the passage of time to
actually realize that recovery and
adaptation and make those gains you
reach a new level of ability and then
you repeat the process by going again
and again and again through that same
thing stimulus recovery adaptation
that's a training principle sra
covered in our book scientific
principles of strength training with
myself dr james hoffman and chad west
smith if you want to buy that book
it has words and letters in it all right
so that's the training process what is
the role of nutrition well
the recovery adaptive process which
actually makes you better is powered by
nutrition
if you don't get enough calories the
actual stimulative yield what you get
out of the training shrinks a lot
possibly completely if you're eating
very very little your body on its role
of sort of priority list of things to do
keeping your brain and heart alive or
like really fucking number one keeping
your blood clean and
all that shit is like number two and
then getting stronger is like number
eighteen thousand or something on that
list so if you're not eating enough
calories your body prioritizes almost
everything else before strength so if
you're under eating your nutrition
supply is not adequate you're probably
not going to be getting nearly as strong
as you could or not stronger at all
potentially being in a plateau
if you eat enough calories but you don't
get enough protein which is the raw
building block and recovery block for
muscle tissue you might not grow much or
any new muscle you might actually lose
muscle and then you will have really
wildly shrinking gains or no gains at
all thus causing a plateau
if you don't get enough carbohydrate you
might be okay but you might also not
have as much energy for the next time
you come in
and that
energy may be so low that you can't even
present a robust stimulus you may not be
able to hit prs and thus you don't get
stronger over time and maybe you can
make some gains but they're not the best
gains or in the worst case you can't
actually plateau because you're so
starved of carbohydrates they're the
best source of fuel for repeated high
intensity training you don't have enough
and you're just not doing super well for
yourself very few people say man you
know i switch to that low carb diet my
strength is skyrocketing you almost
never hear a shit like that for a reason
what about relaxation well
fight-or-flight and the fight-or-flight
mode that your body has the sympathetic
nervous system activation is a great
mode for stimulating gains like if
you're not amped up in the gym you're
probably not making a whole lot of gains
because you're not training that hard
however
once you're in the gym and you're out
recovery and adaptation are supposed to
happen because you want to adapt but the
fight or flight mode is antithetical to
recovery and adaptation it's actually
the opposite mode your body has like
kind of two modes in the nervous system
and hormonal environment it's like fuck
shit up attack kill train and then relax
rebuild recover and there's not a whole
lot of middle ground between those and
the further on the extremes you can be
the better that means when you're in
training fucking crush it when you're in
recovery in adaptive mode you got to be
chill chill chill because that maximizes
how much you actually gain strength wise
muscle wise everything
so
parasympathetic dominance is kind of
what that's called that is the state of
recovery adaptation sympathetic
dominance is the state of fight or
flight there again bipolar thing
very opposite extremes
when you're in training you should be
fucking hardcore in fight or flight when
you're not in training that is the other
22 hours of the day or whatever you
should be as chill as possible if you're
chronically in an unrelaxed state your
adaptive magnitude how many gains you're
making how much gains i don't know say
that will shrink significantly possibly
if you're stressed out enough to zero
and then you're in a plateau
the more relaxed you are
the better your nutrition and training
work together in order to actually
produce the greatest adaptations between
training sessions keeping you from
hitting plateausville which is a
terrible place to be
lastly is the role of sleep
direct studies on sleep quantity and
sleep quality
or
sleep duration is the quantity part
reveal that sleep is a huge muscle
builder and fat burner man
sleep is like the ultimate drug and i
know people say that and they're
bullshitting you but there's legit no
amount of trend you can take that
replaces a certain insufficient amount
of sleep and i've seen guys try and it
doesn't fucking work you just fall apart
mostly mentally and then physically so
sleep recharges training energy among
others so it builds muscle and it cuts
fat which is fucking awesome
it recharges training energy like
nothing else in this world a good night
of sleep will make you fucking superman
a bad night of sleep will make you not
super mad i don't have anything clever
to say what's that motherfucker that
hangs out with superman all the time in
the tower jimmy
scott the video guy what's his name
jimmy the red headed kid i've never
watched a comic
book life
you've got to be careful saying that on
youtube scott's a video guy hates comic
books and he calls superman a comic book
thing so
please feel free to hate him in the
comments
jimmy olsen thank you
all right yeah he's a cunt you don't
want to be like him so
low sleep amount or a low sleep quality
can prevent
overloading sessions from even occurring
because there's a thing if you bench 315
five and you come in next week or a
couple sessions later and you want to
bench 315 for sets of six or 325 sets of
five if you had shitty night sleep
you might hit 315 for a set of three two
two and then relative to last week
you're not even presenting a huge
overload and thus your body's like i
don't know this is kind of a repeat
slash easier i'm not going to get any
stronger because this you know this is
not really a challenge to be to be able
to progressively challenge yourself you
have to be pretty fucking well rested uh
if you're well rested at all so that's
something to think um
proper sleep also to the point of muscle
building keeps anabolic processes
humming along and the catabolic ones at
bay on the other hand if you miss a lot
of sleep your body is legit and this is
kind of terrible if you miss a lot of
sleep your body is in like muscle
burning mode which is awful right and
interestingly a lot of strength
adaptations specifically the
neurological ones
seem to occur preferentially during
sleep your sleep is kind of cool is when
your brain does some other weird shit
clear some uh metabolites and stuff and
it really does does some rewiring it
does a lot of learning you sort of learn
more deeply things you've experienced
that day encoding occurs but also that
seems to happen with strength so you
actually get stronger in your sleep
which is kind of cool you know instead
of saying goodnight to your snake for
another you'd be like best gains to you
honey you lie down you realize you're
speaking to a laptop with a porn star on
it because let's be honest you don't
have a girlfriend there's nobody on the
other side of that bed it's a cold other
side of that bed in youtube land so
all these things come together to
facilitate hard training nutrition
relaxation and sleep are massive
and allow you to actually train to
become your strongest possible
because
you do not get stronger during training
you simply express your strength you get
stronger between sessions and if you
don't get proper nutrition relaxation
and sleep
you're cutting down on how much you gain
a ton potentially to the point where
your plateaued and dick happens
and yes
training stimulates strength to occur
but nutrition relaxation and sleep
actually make the strength enhancement
occur
okay so
training stimulates strength gains
nutrition sleep and relaxation realize
them that's a big deal
such a big deal that i even wrote first
not off hand analogy in a while i even
wrote a really stupid analogy i thought
i'd share with you guys so
the logical primacy here is the super
super importance of nutrition relaxation
and sleep
you can think of training as so so so
here's the deal we have
a crew of cleaners and you have a house
gaining strength is your house getting
cleaned the crew of cleaners is three
people nutrition sleep and relaxation
each one's a person
training when you stimulate training in
the gym is like money that you pay them
okay if
okay an improvement of strength is your
house actually getting cleaner we've got
three cleaners nutrition relaxation and
sleep you're paying the money and the
money paying is the stimulus it's the
training you do in the gym
if you don't pay the crew
your house isn't getting fucking clean
which is why if you don't train with
fucking weights it doesn't matter how
much nutrition sleep relaxation you're
getting
doesn't there's no strength injuries no
house getting clean
now
if you pay a shitload of money to the
crew
but you prevent them from accessing your
house you're still not getting any
cleaner so if you say oh my god i had a
great training session here's 900 fellas
clean the fuck out of this house
and then you don't get proper or any
nutrition recovery or sorry nutrition
relaxation
and sleep that's like paying the guys
900 bucks be like clean this house and
they're like you're off on a work trip
or something and they're like the
the door is locked and they call you on
your phone like hey your door's locked
and also the back door and you don't
pick up
and they're like okay so
i guess we'll have to return the money
at some point but we can't clean your
house because we're not fucking breaking
into your house and getting shot by the
police or something shit like that so
if you stimulate a bunch of gains by
training hard and then you go and you
have wild clubbing nights or whatever
that's super fun but if you don't let
nutrition relaxation and sleep go into
your house to clean it so to speak go
into your body and make it better then
you're just getting dick out of it so
not only do we have to have plenty of
money to pay the cleaners hard training
but we also have to let the cleaners in
the fucking house move the fuck out of
their way and let them do their shit
which means getting good nutrition good
relaxation and good sleep it's pretty
much that simple that an analogy is dumb
as fuck in my opinion but maybe you guys
will get a kick right
so why is this so primary
right
why is it so important for us to state
this as nutrition
relaxation and sleep being so fucking
important well here's the deal
when people ask me generally for help
with a strength plateau the first thing
i do
is uh i ask them whether or not they're
really plateaued and variety of clever
questions from the last video we did
but
when i remember
i will ask them how is your nutrition
how is your sleep and how is your
relaxation
right
the question is
first after any plateau is detected for
real that's the first question
because if they don't have their
nutrition a relaxation and or sleep
sorted
it doesn't really fucking matter what
they do in training right you can train
hard easy out load at reps undulate
linear blah blah blah blah bands and
chains and it doesn't matter if you
don't get proper nutrition relaxation
and sleep it just doesn't fucking matter
if you're under slept underfed or
overstressed i don't care what program
you're doing
because it's kind of similar and another
analogy is like you have this awesome
race car but you haven't put any fucking
gas into it i don't give a shit how slow
you think it is even if it's not moving
like
every race cars plateau you know fucking
put gas into the shit or change the oil
or actually move the steering wheel
around so
that's why these things come before any
discussions and in this video series
come before any discussions of actually
getting
into the training program i promise
we'll do that in later videos that's all
we do in later videos it's the last
you'll hear about nutrition relaxation
and sleep is this video but you got to
get them right because any advice is
just fucking garbage let me make another
shitty analogy for you um
it's kind of like asking for in-person
dating advice like how to relate to the
same or opposite sex when like you have
the worst breath of all time and
everyone knows but no one tells you
you're like okay so like what do i say
to girls uh hello or oh no no it's too
much hi or uh my name is mike
if you're doing that they're like fuck
are you gonna die and they don't tell
you shit and it seems like nothing works
that's the same thing with nutrition
relaxation and sleep in training is you
could be the most advanced program of
all time but if you don't get them shits
you don't get anything right so brush
your fucking teeth and make sure to get
nutrition relaxation and sleep at the
same time right
so our first recourse in actually
working on a confirmed plateau is to get
your recovery sorted first and then
you'll often start making great gains
you're like fuck i'm glad i didn't
change my program that really wasn't the
problem what you don't want to do is
never address these things change your
program all the time be like i can't
believe it like i'm just a hard gainer
or something like that a lot of times
this isn't always true a lot of times
people who say they're hard gainers you
look at their lifestyle and their
nutrition often is really shitty but
even the relaxation and sleep can suck
you know you're not a hard gainer you
just like are living in a a life where
you probably can't make gains unless you
had elite tear genetics right
then if you fix the problem
you're good you're fixed you're making
gains however if you get your nutrition
relaxation and sleep sorted and you
still are plateaued then you know it's
not those things then you can attack
your training pretty confidently knowing
that it's either you're training or
you've hit your genetic ceiling at least
we're down to two and not down to a
whole bunch more right now we're
actually going to say they're important
we'll leave you with some really good
recommendations although on the right
side superiorization youtube channel we
have tons and tons of more in-depth
videos about how to do this properly
at the very least
for strength gains three things
first is eat to at least maintain your
weight probably means you should have at
least one gram of protein per pound of
body weight per day or something like
that
and that should probably mean like four
or more at least four well-balanced
healthy meals if you're not doing that
at the business it's not fucking that
hard to do if you're not doing that shit
i don't know maybe it's nutrition that's
the problem and not your program
number two try to have a low to moderate
daily stress level i didn't say low
because we live in the fucking real
world right
so
you don't want to be in a situation
where like stress feels like it's
climbing for days on end because if it
is again we go back to video number one
of like you're not probably at a plateau
you're just probably stressed out like
crazy you have like 10 different
deadlines and three weeks of hell work
at your job and you're like fuck man i'm
plateaued like i know it's probably your
job it's probably nothing else so make
sure you get that sorted first and uh in
most cases have at least an hour to
relax at the end of each day time to
yourself dr james hoffman rp always says
that i think it's a really great point
um at the end of the day i will say
something that i think is potentially
valuable to some of you uh we all have
this tendency like especially when we're
seeing some success in what we're doing
a success at work success and dating
success in uh
video games i don't know what else other
people do i just work i don't do any of
that shit uh we tend to think fuck fuck
this is awesome i'm just gonna do more
of this or we're the kind of people that
want to have three different hobbies
eight different involvements read six
different books and what you end up
doing is like yeah on paper you look
like fucking superman
or superwoman and people are like oh my
god how do you know all this stuff how
do you get all this stuff done and in
reality you're a high stress
motherfucker who never even has time to
themselves and you sweet you check mark
the fucking shit out of your life and
then you die you fucking never had any
fun and also your training sucks which
is really bad because you've sort of
chosen to put yourself on a super high
stress scenario so maybe if you really
care about your strength training try to
put yourself in a scenario where like
yes i'm an online coach i could i could
take 30 clients this month but i'm only
going to take 20 because i really really
important meat coming up and i want to
stay moderately stressed at most that's
a choice you could make like like you
know your girlfriend's like hey should
we buy a cat you know maybe not maybe
you're already full of all the shit you
want to stress about and you don't get
any bonus points there's no one like on
high grading you well like maybe if you
believe that shit but like they're like
oh yeah like you fucking got a cat and
you could still take care of it your
life didn't fall apart a plus
that's not how it works so make sure
stress a lot of times is not a choice
it's totally out of your hands for sure
and if you're in that situation that
maybe strength training is not number
one priority anyway but if you really
really really give a shit about getting
strong try to like make sure the rest of
your life isn't so like kind of
schizophrenic in the way that you're
reaching for 50 different things and
being good at everything and then maybe
a solution to a lot of your stress
problems
lastly get enough sleep uh to not feel
sleepy through the day that's a huge
metric i fucking put my full dr mike
seal of approval i should make those
like a little fucking you buy a stamp
and it says dr mike said you're cool
if you feel sleepy
through the day in other words if you're
chronically felt under slept you
probably are
on average the recommendation is eight
hours of sleep at night can you
supplement it with naps maybe sometimes
that works sometimes it throws off your
sleep schedule don't do it if it does
but i will say this it's almost
foolproof i've had a ton of people at
seminars all around the world you guys
like that not humble brag
ask me
and ask a doctor james hoffman who's our
sleep and recovery expert around south
fertilization you guys see him every two
weeks on the weekly bi-weekly my webinar
or whatever we have
like how do i know if am i like i sleep
xyz am i getting enough sleep how do i
know if i'm getting enough sleep it's a
really easy answer that
do you have to have caffeine in order to
stay awake through the day they're like
yes you're not getting enough sleep
okay unless you're some kind of weird
person or you do profoundly boring job
that you fucking hate
you shouldn't just be falling asleep
randomly through the day or getting
unreal crazy drowsy that shouldn't be
happening
yeah caffeine helps to make you super
but if it just brings you to normal
you're not getting enough sleep if
you're always red-eyed you know you feel
like your eyes are itchy and stuff
you're probably sleeping so if you think
you're under sleeping you probably are
if you're like i don't know i don't
really get tired through the day if i'll
sleep fine at night i sleep eight or
nine hours i'm totally good
any more than that's probably a bad idea
but you kind of know when you're under
sleeping so don't don't bullshit
yourself
once you've sorted all this stuff
you're doing the basics consistently of
nutrition relaxation and sleep
then you can try to focus on to your
training content
and seeing if that is the thing that
needs to fix the plateau so you either
fix the plateau with it
or you fixed all the stuff and for a
mesocycle you're doing all the good
stuff training nutrition uh sorry uh
nutrition relaxation and sleep and all
of a sudden you're like man i still not
any better i still haven't hit any pr's
then you can attend to the training and
fix that to make sure you hit pr's again
but in many cases the fix of nutrition
relaxation and sleep even making them
marginally better
will sort you out completely you hit
pr's and all as well folks see you next
week for the next video in the series
