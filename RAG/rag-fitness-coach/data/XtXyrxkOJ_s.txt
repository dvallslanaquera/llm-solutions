oh my god we are back it's the bi-weekly
q a dr james doctor mike coming at you
here to answer questions
dr michael chopping how's it going
good james i have something to tell you
that i just talked about a youtube video
that won't be released for probably half
a year um but
i
have co-opted my wife crystal into
re-watching the lord of the rings
trilogy with me
the extended edition or the the regular
we are doing the regular okay okay okay
all right not a lot of kudos to her but
she doesn't know
so she's real new to the shit now she
says
she's seen it before but then shit will
happen in the plot where she's like is
that gonna die and i'm like you have a
bitch you haven't seen it get out of
here this is frodo girl
i think he dies
uh but in any case i got to re-watch the
original
one does not simply walk into
and i was like wow that's where the meme
is did you get up and we're like oh he
did it he did it it was so satisfying it
was satisfying to see
oh man i can't
i can't unsee sam uh from his svu
appearance where he was like the creepy
like
boy scout
camp leader or whatever i can i don't
have to he is a creep i don't hate sam
it's like you're just dead weight you
fucking asshole you had a chance to kill
what's his name smeagol and you didn't
do it like a little yeah oh by the way
while i'm at it what's his name
the one that's not simply guy he hit a
name didn't he boromir
war mirror yo if i was on that squad
sean what's his pen yeah
if i was on that squad and voramir
started his old bullshit like the first
time
i'd be like
this shit ends right now
you're gonna nut up we're gonna get the
shit done or get the fuck off our crew
talk about temptation i should be with
the one with the ring i will put that
ring somewhere you're gonna technically
own it you're not gonna want it where i
put it motherfucker dude totally i hate
to be this guy um but i'm gonna go there
for just a minute if you read the books
um what's really funny about boromir is
like half of the first book they just
talk about how fucking strong he is like
they're just a lot of the the book is
just like them walking and not much is
happening they're just kind of
describing the scene and so much of it
is like oh boring you're so fucking
strong he could throw those fucking
little bitch-ass hobbits over the
mountain if he wanted to there's a part
where they're like trekking through the
snow and he's like bore me or like chop
the snow with his sword because he's so
fucking awesome and it they really do
like embellish about how awesome and
badass he is in the book it's really
funny that he just takes a fucking dive
if you are into some of those characters
it actually is worth reading the books
at some point because it's just it's
just different enough where and and like
kind of quirky enough where it's kind of
funny
dude
it's full of version vr over his thing
and it's like super intelligent so we
can put in any scenario ever
i'm for sure
like getting me and you as like
contractors to like help proto get the
ring across and we just join the crew i
just wanna i get we get dbz powers in
this by the way i know it's not fair but
so i just want to be like let me see the
ring he's like oh it gives me the ring
i'm like
i disappeared and i saw a big red eye
he's like ah i'm like this ring sucks
you can have it i don't want it the plug
this is like a ring of power i'm like do
i get special powers no it's just
invisible and this fucking asshole just
keep watching me and talking shit in
some kind of demonic language like
you like put the ring on and you're like
i see a big red eye and they're like
yeah and you're like
you just blow the shit out of it so
sweet the decision
did we do it they're like the ring like
fades away and lose all its power like i
guess you can keep it now they're like
wow that shortened the movie i'm going
to sell this at a thrift store
the former lord of the rings ring the
current you're like no it doesn't have
any more powers ah shit here's five
cents this is a fake this is fake
all right i'm ready
i'm sure uh uh whoever does our time
stamps i forgot his name at the moment
milo milo uh
this this is some bullshit yeah put it
away from title right
here we go
we had uh more than a few questions with
quite a quite a bit of upvotes this week
so very good our our loyal fan base very
good with the
yes i kind of remember which ones they
were so let's just go from the top to
bottom and let you know if it doesn't uh
it doesn't register so definitely trevor
trev is first
trip
james this one's all you
i'll read it you answer it drama shop
asks what is the most effective and
reliable way to build tendon and other
connective tissue strength and or
durability
yeah great question so
one of the first and most up so i'm
going to say this and then kind of give
it some caveats so the first and most
obvious way of
improving the strength of connective
tissues like tendons ligaments bone etc
is by putting them under stress and
tension so by far the biggest stimulator
is tension now there are limitations as
to how you apply that tension stress
right because you could easily just say
like okay i want to build stronger
tendons let me load up 200 of my 1rm and
see if i can unrack this bar
really bad idea right so kind of the
best way of going about
presenting attention stimulus
is by implementing repeated tension
stimuli in a sustainable way and it just
so happens that hypertrophy training
works really good now if we were to say
what is better in terms of improving
tendon and ligaments and we'll say bone
strength
strength training versus hypertrophy
training you would have to give the nod
to strength training however strength
training also comes with a greater risk
of injuring those tissues because the
amount of load that you use is more
overloading in that sense whereas
hypertrophy training typically uses
loads that don't really put those kind
of tissues at a very significant risk of
injury and therefore may not strengthen
them as rapidly but in the long term i
would say hypertrophy training turns out
is just a coincidentally really really
effective way of improving the strength
of those and
if you are on that team full rom uh
subscription
training them not only with tension but
also training them under very very large
ranges of motion actually improves what
i would call their mobility
characteristics meaning not only their
ability to tolerate tension but ability
to tolerate tension from the um terminal
ranges of motion i mean doesn't get much
better than hypertrophy training in that
regard so there's definitely other ways
if you wanted to look at bones
specifically um impacts are actually a
very good way of strengthening bone
tissue but again trade-off yeah
trade-offs comes with a lot of risk um
so turns out just like good old meat and
potatoes hypertrophy training is
probably a sweet middle ground of like
both improving tendon ligament strength
bone strength without presenting a huge
risk of injury as well mike how'd it do
beautiful phenomenal uh better than i
would have i will say that you know some
people typically think oh limit strength
sets of one to three but it's funny
because sets of 103 you start
experiencing connective tissue sort of
pain and
weakness issues what they tell you to do
in the literature is to do like sets of
ten to make them stronger and there's at
least one study to directly sort of
examine this and
alternating
uh
lower load higher rep phases in order to
build connective tissue strength so
yes linear thinking would say okay the
heavier it is the better but the
stimulus to fatigue ratio wise
especially sustainability wise it seems
like hypertrophy training actually does
a really really good job of that
and you could maybe make a caveat and
say like like metabolite training is
probably the least you know conducive
for that type of goal
um whereas like 150 wraps yeah under 15
reps there you go five to 15 reps and
you're probably fucking cold yeah
good question
yep next up is forest nash fitness
we didn't hit show less because we don't
want to read this whole question i'm
totally kidding
looks i like the show laughs pretty
handsome in the avatara smash hello he's
actually actually my name is forrest
fitness the national nickname right oh
he has like a huge neck beard in real
life gross hey guys i slightly doctored
the photograph
just kidding forrest we love you
hi docs lately i've been considering
going back to school part-time to do a
bachelor's degree in training nutrition
related field i feel like i already have
a pretty solid grasp of the applied
principles of training nutrition based
large part of the content you guys put
on rp aw
thank you i would love to gain a deeper
understanding of the underlying
mechanics of nutrition and human
physiology how to interact with the body
and respond to training stimuli etc i
work as an online coach and i'm not
planning to change careers as i find it
pretty fulfilling so this would be
mainly to further my own depth of
knowledge or become more of an
extraordinary field i was just wondering
if you guys could share any advice as to
what type of degree might be best fit
for what i'm after
nutrition physiology sports exercise
science et cetera or what to look for in
a good academic program
many thanks for your help as always well
awesome question for us thanks for
asking
james i'm going to go ahead and hang
myself on this one this is
this is the the battle in which i die
um
i
think that in the modern
economy
in the exercise and sport training
fields
outside of an attempt to become
ultra high level specific expert
super brainiac mega fucking nerd
who knows as much as possible possible
possible
and or most importantly
someone who is choosing to have
credentials in order to bolster their
business or just for their ego you know
you're tired of people not calling you
doctor when you go to the airport like
that
um
i don't think there's a compelling
reason in this field
to get a formal education and i think
that you can simply go to the library
get some books on
sport science training physiology
nutrition work through the textbooks
work through the problem sets read
everything practice practice practice
and after two
months or four months or six months
spent on every textbook for about a year
straight you'll know more than almost
everyone who's got an undergrad on the
ship um
another thing you can do is
find out what the books are in the
graduate classes or undergrads that
they're using and just read the books
yourself and
maybe the sometimes you can buy the
books on the market and they come with
like you know sort of web links for
video instruction all this other stuff
you just work through it yourself
um i would say some certs are very good
they teach you stuff but it seems like
you know what you're doing at an applied
level already asserts probably not
exactly up your alley so i would just do
reading start with textbooks and branch
out to articles and
reviews that you're interested about
further from the textbooks i'd say it's
probably your best bet unless you
actually want a degree for that stamp um
james and i both have a bunch of them um
but i i don't know if it's exactly worth
it um if you're new and you're 18 years
old and you don't know what you want to
do and you maybe want to do fitness yeah
getting an undergrad may be a good idea
but if you're already a successful coach
it sounds like you are and you know just
on price alone shit is a tough fucking
sell and you may be quite disappointed
with what you're
getting changed i think you nailed it i
was i wasn't sure which direction you
were going to go and i was worried that
i was going to sound like the crazy
tinfoil hat but you got you beat me to
it
i was actually going to say that my
opinion on this has been kind of
changing and maybe you if you guys have
been listening for a while you might
have caught wind of this a little bit
but
i personally think at the current time
um academia is kind of going
into the toilet i know that makes me
sound like a tinfoil hat person and i
recognize that but wouldn't southern
tinfoil have people for sure what is
true is that prices have gone up
exponentially bureaucracy at the
university has gone up exponentially and
the quality of education has been going
down over time
um so what i have been
you know uh hesitantly telling people is
that unfortunately the universities and
just um
academia in general is no longer kind of
serving the purpose that it used to
right now it seems to just be like a a
mill for
allowing people to get you know
credentials with very low um
what's the word
uh they're just becoming degree mills in
which people who are largely unqualified
are able to get a degree and they're
less about like introducing people to
the great thinkers and more about
just teaching ideologies in which you
are supposed to fall in line yikes so i
actually kind of tend to agree with mike
here maybe for the same and slightly
different reasons in that i just don't
feel like people are getting the bang
for their buck that they used to at the
university and it's pretty hard as mike
said it's a pretty big price point to
swallow to walk away and say like this
is all shit i could have just figured
out from reading on my own
pro tip so i can get off this crazy uh
crazy tinfoil hat spot um
one thing that i did and this is to kind
of go back to mike's point about
figuring out which textbooks they they
use in the classroom this is just a pro
tip from me
when i was applying for jobs and i had
to do a couple lectures guest lectures
as part of my job application for
academia
what i would do is look up the course
catalog of the university which is you
can usually do for free and you don't
have to have a library
you look up the course catalog find the
relevant courses and they will always
have
a a book listed as part of the course so
you can literally look up like advanced
nutrition at this university or advanced
you know exercise physiology 2 at this
university um find the course look it up
in the catalog find the book read the
book boom there you go
um i think that what you
don't get from the university you have
to get in the fields anyway you have to
get that kind of uh there's an
intersection of like kind of
knowledge and experience that you have
to kind of melt together to become a
good coach and you're already a coach so
you probably already know this but it's
at the same point it's like okay
what facts don't you know find those in
books and in papers and and then
synthesize it with what you already know
and then that's how you become a better
coach
we're actually writing a similar idea
down that we implement for later
in the book that i'm working on i i kind
of like go on a really big tangent about
like what it means to do evidence-based
practice and that book is unfortunately
on hold because we have a very big cool
project in the works that i can't talk
about and
if you take a hint it's it's enough to
delay a book from the one and only james
hoffman so it must be pretty important
i can't hold the news anymore i'll tell
you what we're working on it's an rv
robot it's an rp robot it has a gun and
it comes with people as she goes are you
following a fitness lifestyle and you're
like no he's like
and he just blows people up we're going
to get your motherfucker
one way or another yeah you were going
to do it unreal james i would i really
rock my rocker you'd have to send the
robot after me then exactly are you
doctor mike israel yes
who's also in the shape of a squid
that would be fucking sweet god damn
that's an engineer fracking rp robot i
don't want any other kind of robot now
that you mention it
really big was cool wasn't he but g
little is even cooler
is there a j a big j and a j little hey
hey little j he's like it's j little not
little j like yeah whatever fuck of the
fuck
what about bmij
[Music]
technically i'm big but i'm not fat like
okay jay
all right this episode is good
everyone's gonna be like this episode
sucks thumbs down you guys are mean
actually i had a lot of shit in the
comments for like i think i mentioned
what my tattoos meant look people ask me
and they're like really iron rand you're
an idiot and you cringe and i'm like man
people god damn
motherfucker can't even get us fucking
getting this breathing right back here
i know
it's usually we like most of our
episodes only have like four thumbs down
when we get into like our personal stuff
it goes up to like 11 because people are
like oh god damn it don't worry
guns
you're a bad person with bad thoughts
jay little is a good person with good
thoughts and he asks hi docs we know the
lack of sleep interferes with gains but
could you put numbers to how much it
interferes for example if i have one
night a week during which i only sleep
five hours do i lose something like 10
of my gains or something like 50
what about two nights a week well we can
actually answer that question pretty
pretty likely uh that it's not 50 could
that fucking be awful 50
what about two nights a week also if i
do have a bad night of sleep what are
some good ways to drop fatigue except
for recovery training how much would it
help to add more calories or just rest
more on that day thank you for your work
awesome channel well thanks so much for
asking jay apologies for the uh
little jab jokes the expensive you're
actually quite normal name um i'll take
a crack this one james you can play
clean up for me because you're the
expert here is that okay sounds great
so
to your example one night so so the
overarching theme is it's incremental
and it's cumulative which means one
night's not that big of a deal it may be
like if you could have gained a pound of
muscle that week you only have five
hours sleep versus eight maybe you'll
gain nine and a half pounds of muscle
like it's just really nice i'm sorry uh
nine just gonna say 0.95 pounds like
holy shit you mean like 950 more muscle
by not sleeping yeah 98.95 pounds it's
nominal right nominal what program are
they on that's right so it's something
like 10
nothing like 50 percent two nights a
week and you know maybe it bumps to 15
you know something like that so if you
don't get sleep all week enough then
then yeah it's probably like 50 right so
so there's that and then if you do have
a bad night of sleep what are some good
ways to drop fatigue james will answer
that but you say how much would it help
to add more calories probably more
calories is if you don't get enough
sleep the night before adding calories
generally creates a higher degree of
adiposity than normal so there's more of
those calories that go to fat it's
probably not something you want i would
say it just says you said rest more on
that day i would say try to go to bed
earlier that day to really make sure you
get like nine hours of sleep the next
day and that's really the way to wipe
the slate clean james
yeah you nailed it right so the big i
understand where you're going with the
question jay but the big thing we have
to preface is like you can't there's
nothing you can do to work around not
getting enough sleep like you can't eat
your way out of poor sleep you can't
like methamphetamine your way out of
poor sleep
in the long run in the short term sure
but in the long term is going to catch
up with you um so yeah
a couple things here
so the question of like how much gains
do you lose it's hard to put a number on
that but really what you're kind of in
hypertrophy training what you're looking
at is like how much of uh my sl how much
of sleep disruptions can account for
losses in actual like transcription
translation effects of
protein synthesis in the muscles that
you train it's very difficult to put a
number on that but you know it's i would
say
as mike said notable in like a
cumulative sense hard to say in an acute
sense if we were to look at something
else like motor skill development that
is something that actually sleep has a
profound effect on so in hypertrophy
training we're not super concerned with
like motor skills because we tend to
keep movements in for a long time they
get ingrained over time it's most people
don't forget how to bench press
overnight something like that but in
like uh
like laying down the bench you're like
what is this no
yeah
um but we do but what my point being
here is that they have looked at sleep
and motor learning and they have found
that sleep has a profound effect on
potentiating motor learning and there
seems to be almost an all-or-nothing
effect um with sleep and motor learning
meaning like if you are working on some
kind of skills it could be something
simple like learning how to play a piece
on the piano or doing sporting stuff
and if your sleep gets significantly
disrupted that night kind of the efforts
that you put into that motor skill just
don't manifest the way that they
normally would whereas if you um classic
example if anybody's ever played an
instrument like a guitar or piano or
something and you're working on
something and you're just having a
really hard time with it you're like i
can't get it get a good night's rest the
next day you come back to it you're like
just you just crush face melting right
you're like that was nothing to me i'm a
fucking god
it's because a lot of that gets
consolidated when you're sleeping right
so the question is like kind of where is
the intersection of like we know that
hypertrophy is going to be more of a
you know cellular mediated effect
meaning things like the the signaling
pathways are going to dictate whether or
not you actually grow muscle or not but
we also know that there's like a
neuromuscular component in their ability
to generate big overloads through like
smooth efficient forceful movements
that gets affected by sleep
significantly somewhere in the middle is
probably where um sleep disruptions
affect things like hypertrophy like
you're not able to train as effectively
as you could be and you might be not
getting as much recovery and adaptation
as you could be something along those
lines so i'm not i'm not sure i'm not
sure we do know that like not getting
enough sleep is bad and to kind of get
to the latter part of your question you
can't like eat your way out of it so the
the ultimate answer is sleep more if you
want to be at your best and if you can't
do that just know that you won't be at
your best and kind of just do the best
that you can given the circumstances
that you're in
awesome james thank you so much jay if
you want to google meno henselman sleep
games you'll get a lot of really good
things because metal has actually shared
some studies in which they put numbers
on some of the stuff they're not general
numbers but for the specific study
design
preview
it's significant
for muscle and and fat so
interesting and like
yeah sorry i just i had another thought
why as you were saying that meno's great
by the way and whenever mike and i are
like not sure about something we're
always like let's see what manner has to
say about this because he's usually
pretty reasonable um with sleep you kind
of have the one-two punch of like you
have
cellular interference effects where you
just don't get enough sleep and that
kind of dampens some of the recovery
adaptive processes but then you have
indirect effects where you're just
fucking tired and now you can't train as
hard right so like long-term that's that
a one-two punch of not growing muscle
like not recovering and just not able to
perform or do overload training
you can see where that's going down yeah
100
next up very quick question from john
3 16 jk
religiously uh
he says
regarding rest times is 225 for 987 with
longer rest times any different 25 965
or shorter rest times if uh uh if
proximity to failure is the same i did a
james on that one um
as long as
the shorter rest times hits the four
factor
checklist for rest the results are going
to be very difficult to parse
in any meaningful sense so roughly
identical
you're no longer limited
cardiovascularly before you start your
next snap you're no longer limited
neurologically you feel strong again no
other muscles are limiting the movement
like you're trying to hit quasi-squat
when your lower back is still fried you
didn't rest long enough and the muscle
can hit at least five good hard reps
again then gee whiz you know that you're
probably good to go but i wouldn't rest
much longer than that you can rest
longer maybe you'll get some kind of
benefit but maybe you won't uh so
that's my best answer james that's an
excellent answer um the oh this is i'm
man of my splitting hairs here so
preface that but the only time i would
say there might be a potential benefit
to the longer rest is for people who are
in strength and power sports and you're
doing like hypertrophy to potentiate
gains and strength and power and in that
case like if you take longer rests and
you're doing 987 but those 987s are like
boom really explosive really forceful
every time that's a at least i don't
want to say a significant but a tangible
advantage in transfer of training into
your sporting activities whereas like if
you're doing the other like the 965 and
they're just kind of slow and normal i
would say i won't say slow but like
normal pace training um maybe that's not
as good as like taking a longer rest and
having a little more pep in your step
but for hypertrophy training i think
what dr mike said was exactly correct
yeah very very sure
next up is tomare one of our regulars
yeah oops i undid it there we go
yeah shut up turmeric
uh we're gonna answer a third of your
question
how important is it as an intermediate
to focus only
on the big muscles and not the small
ones traps calves forms abs i train four
times a week
up upper lower and don't know if i
should focus on taking all the big
muscles i need the mrv or try to add
some sets to small muscle groups my goal
is max hypertrophy i'm guessing the
answer would be to train from any of the
mrv as much muscle as i can but why
why is all the way to mrv for some
muscles at a time more hypertrophy than
all muscles mav to mav-ish
plus do bigger muscle groups okay so uh
let's answer that one first so the
technical answer
lies in our book how much should i train
the james and i co-author a few years
back so tomorrow i picked that book up
um and it has a real in-depth answer
it's a theoretical answer so maybe you
can get all the same games going mev to
mavish but already based on the way you
said it the problem can be
conceptualized a little bit more sharply
there's no such thing as mav as a
standard set in stone variable mev and
mrv themselves are
but
mav is a floating variable that is lower
when you start a program and drifts up
as you get accumulated to more volume
and need more to get your
optimal progress it's like saying what's
the optimal amount of french language
exposure do i need to get better at
french well the first week of french
like five words the second week of
french ten words the fifteenth week of
french you need motherfuckers to have
full conversations with you
the mrv is whatever tilts you over meds
whatever doesn't help you learn french
at all but nav even over the course of
weeks changes so what you think you
really need to say is mav to halfway to
mrv typically which is fine and maybe
that results in quite good gains the
thing is
especially as you get more intermediate
more advanced there is some decent
theoretical reason to at least open our
minds to possibility
that some of the best games maybe not
all
lie between midway through med
to mrv which we'll call pretend mav or
average mav
to mrv effect pushing now what is the
precedent for that idea well let's just
look at working sets it's been pretty
clear that the most hypertrophic reps
are probably the last five that doesn't
mean the first ones aren't hypertrophic
oh they are
but she whiz if you never push it close
to failure
man most of the research says that
you're probably going to be lacking does
that mean you have to push to feel all
the time no
but just the same way
you also could just not know your mrvs
you think you're midway but you're like
fucking light years away from them so
you're just piddle paddling with easy
training all the time
so in order to make sure
that you know and there's all other
theoretical problems or practical
problems that results how do you know
when you've hit midway through how do
you know you're not not doing enough
like if your progress hasn't stalled how
do you know another week of adding
more intensity and volume won't you
cause even more progress or continued
progress so
yeah you'll probably get great results
but if you're really serious
about getting your best results most of
the time taking most muscles from med to
mrv is probably a good idea here's
another contention to that another point
if you have a situation
in which your
total body mrv
starts to be uh a sum that is less than
all the muscles added together you
actually can't you have to cut some
muscles short and then those shortcut
muscles maybe that shortcut is still
good enough you train a few sets above
immediate maybe it works maybe it
doesn't work all that well but
another thing is there it's so easy to
maintain muscles that you're better off
putting some on maintenance and pushing
the rest immediate mrv and then just
switching gears later that also boosts
your training efficacy as far as
psychology it's more fun you get more
variation you really get to grind on
something and then put it on the back
burner
from all of those perspectives and many
more described in the book it just makes
a little bit more sense
to prioritize and do what you do now can
you do it the way you're describing for
sure it'll probably work really well but
if we're going to give you our best
advice we would say it's not overly
important to focus on the big muscles
and not the small ones in your example
but it probably pays off now that
answers the medium rv question the big
muscles versus small ones a lot of that
is two things one
if your goal is max hypertrophy is a
goal max hyper feel like for the next
year where does it go max upper trippy
for a like a lifetime because lifetime
and we've spoken about this only before
and addressed it i think in the book as
well the big muscle groups are prone to
injury uh because they generate such
high forces you want to build them nice
and early when you're young and healthy
and have no injury history bringing up
your back when you're all fucked up is
hard bringing up your side delts when
you're all fucked up i mean for the love
of god if you can't train your side else
you really just should retire from
training altogether smaller muscle
groups are easier to bring up later
which is why we prefer to work on the
bigger ones first nine times out of ten
that doesn't mean all the time but
that's kind of thing now if you want to
balance physique at all times you can
work on everything but we would prefer
you prioritize it if you just want to do
sort of mev med plus uh all the time
that's totally cool probably get you
great gains but if we were your coaches
we probably would try to dissuade you um
and then
he also asks do bigger muscle groups
have more potential to grow
and why not rel probably not relative to
their initial sizes it's very relatively
try the same uh also while cutting as it
was to train them all yes because
muscles you don't train during cutting
at least a maintenance will start to
recede
and then he says i'm sorry for the long
question you should apologize how dare
you ask questions on a distinctly
question asking
youtube video uh thank you very much
this channel and you
uh helps
me more than you can imagine well i
don't have very good imagination so
that's easy james what did i miss
yeah that was very thorough an excellent
answer the uh the only other thing that
i'll mention is um for beginners and
intermediates training the big muscle
groups just coincidentally also trains a
lot of those small muscle groups
indirectly so it ends up being a very
efficient way to train now if you're
just doing like chest flies and knee
extensions then that that wouldn't be
true but most people as beginners and
intermediates mostly are going to be at
least per our recommendations would be
focusing on our compound kind of barbell
or multi-joint multi-muscle group
movements even for something like quads
right so for a beginner an intermediate
what's going to be your kind of biggest
bang for your buck for quads it's going
to be something like a high bar squat a
hack squat and or a leg press something
like that well it turns out that that
actually grows your hamstrings a little
bit gross your glutes a little bit grows
your calves a little bit same thing with
like pull-ups pull-downs bench presses
that's going to hit your forearms it's
going to hit your biceps it's going to
hit your triceps it's going to hit uh
just your your front delts so it turns
out that like focusing on those big
muscle groups and taking those as a
priority to mrv
for a very long part of your training
age covers a lot of those little muscle
groups or at least brings them up
notably anyway and then as you become
more advanced if you notice that they
are lagging maybe you haven't done
enough biceps or enough forearms or
enough calves they're very very easy to
bring up because you haven't been doing
all that much direct training so they're
still pretty sensitive to training
stimuli and they come up really fast as
dr mike already said so it's a very
efficient way to train throughout your
training age
next up is ryan markov
got it
ryan google markov modeling will be fun
hey docs how would you recommend
increasing swap mobility i want to get
on the full wrong train but i don't have
a ticket yet
my squat depth is likely limited by hips
and low back tightness from years of low
job job bjj guard playing
uh is it better to just warm up
everything and try to keep going deeper
or have dedicated training time to do
static dynamic mobility training thanks
james i think this is a bit more up your
alley than mine so i guess i'll play
cleanup this time
yeah so like a lot of people are really
into doing the static and dynamic
mobility training there is definitely a
place for that i don't want to come off
and obligate and say like don't do that
that's dumb right
so if we're talking about squat mobility
mike i want to get your insight on this
i i can i can understand people thinking
that hip and back is a limiting factor i
would say
i'm just going to throw out a rough
estimate i would say four out of five
times 80 of the time it's usually calves
calves are what really can people
mobility ankle mobility from getting
into that really really high bar squat
position um the good high bar squat
position it's one of those things where
people are like oh i'm so tired i can't
squat and you just you just go like put
some plates under your heels and watch
this and then they go boom perfect
weight lifter high bar squat and you're
like yeah dude that was it so that's
where having something like
weightlifting shoes or elevating your
heels can help quite a bit so i'm not
trying to say that you're wrong i would
just say that in my experience it's
usually the ankle mobility that gets
people on that uh full rom train gets
them the ticket on the full rom train um
tightness in the lower back and hips can
actually help you like stay in a better
position on the hypersquad servers yeah
right so um so that being said the way
that you actually improve mobility is
first by first and foremost by
practicing your technique that is number
one that comes first so whenever you are
doing squats or you're training legs
you're always trying to get the best
range of motion that you can within the
tech technique constrictions that you
are applying so
you might uh in the example of a high
bar squat i don't don't don't take this
out of context and said dr james said to
do this but just as an example you might
find james said yeah you might find that
like you can squat with with what you
think is really great technique down to
about parallel and then at parallel you
start to see like your your weight
shifts forward onto your tippy toes and
you start getting some butt wink right
so you might say okay that's kind of
like where my technique really starts to
break down so your goal is to use a
moderate weight not a heavy weight not a
lightweight but use kind of a moderate
weight maybe something like 10 to 15
repetition range that you can do as far
down as you can before your technique
really really starts to break down so
you want to get as much range as you can
under load while using good technique so
that is first and foremost like practice
using moderate loads with the best
technique that you can and slowly and
steadily try to increase your range of
motion over time that is number one
can't get around it after that you can
work on some additional things like some
calf stretching some hamstring
stretching things like that that's going
to pay dividends in the long term
but it's not going to make a really
really tangible effect in the short term
in the short term what you have to do is
just get incrementally more and more
comfortable into that deep squat
position one thing that mike and i have
used in the past and i think would
continue to recommend to this day
are pause squats par squats are a really
really excellent way of just with and
you have here's the great thing about
paw squats it forces you to do it
correctly with good technique in the
actual full depth or at least as far as
you can go
and because it's paused you can't use
heavy weights you motherfucker you got
to use some light ass weights and get
that technique down so sit at the bottom
of the pause and try to make it a little
deeper
for like two or three seconds and then
come up and get down and then let it
sink and then come up what's um what's
the squat variation where you use the
safety bar and you have the hand holds
um you know what i mean
yeah the hatfield squad i think hatfield
squat so what you can and this is a
great one if you have a safety bar is
you do the hatfield style squat in a
pause like controlled way you go down as
far as you can before you feel like your
technique is breaking down and if you
can't go down all the way it's okay
you've got that like hatfield position
so you're nice and stable and you'll
come back up that's an awesome one to
try and train paw squats down all the
way while still feeling really secure
and stable so um i feel like i'm
rambling on this question too much but
story short is use moderate loads work
on the technique um don't think that uh
doing a lot of stretching or like
peeing dog bird dog whatever like
swinging your hips around is gonna make
a huge difference in the in the long
term it will help slowly over time but
the way that you improve range of motion
uh in the short and moderate and long
term is by stretch under load and doing
it in the most ecologically valid
context possible which is in this case
the movement that you're trying to
actually improve upon which is the squat
super
super all right next up oh it's actually
somebody way out of the screen
oh no i have to go to the search
function control f
henrik anderson oh henrik is a fucking
superstar of just getting upvoted like
crazy
people love him
wait is it uh this one supernatural yes
correct correct correct henrik asks are
supinated grip curls all you need
uh or would you recommend including some
neutral
pronated grip curls
um
neutral grip curls
like this like a hammer curl no no no i
think he meant oh
grip supinator grip curls for biceps
okay got it
curls for the grip so he's wondering
like maybe hammer hammer style or hammer
or reverse style i personally do
supinated curls because i don't see how
bracket radialis could be a weak point
when i hear uh to get that bracket very
alice real big i usually think it's
something these so-called influencers
say to get the views by true is there
any point of doing anything else other
than supinated curls so so here's the
thing uh two things we'll just pick one
one at a time
on
uh what are called reverse curls or
basically pronated grip curls a limiting
factor is typically your thumb strength
which is dick so unless you get some
kind of like setup where you have a
versa grip it's probably fucking wasting
your time
uh secondarily to that they work on some
cool muscles right here
but if you do like face pulls and stuff
and other shoulder stuff it actually
gets hit a lot during that
um in addition to that and this is
something i'm pretty
uh my position may i don't know if it
surprised anyone it's a it's a different
view than many people have i think
hammer curls are not always but often a
giant waste of time doesn't think about
like the way you do every pulling
variation almost
it's in that position
so the muscles involved there are a few
radios bracket radiators etc
there are a few
muscles in there that are so fucking
highly taxed in every fucking pulling
thing you do
and then you realize okay what pulling
am i generally not doing the under the
answer is underhand pulling and most you
know we have some but most pulling is
not it's either neutral or neutral just
facing this way
and
then at that point it's like man
i guess really you know those muscles
get zapped all the time and i think that
outside of trying some hammer curls and
seeing if you can see a real noticeable
visual change in six months mostly you
just need to do supinated curls because
you're probably just wanting your biceps
and the other muscles of the forearm the
upper arm are probably hit pretty well
to just backwork and shoulder work
um
[Music]
that's that's my thoughts james
yeah i totally agree now there there are
this is one of those kind of like uh
individualization type problems where
like so mike and i are probably
different whereas i feel like hammer
curls and i and reverse curls are ones
that i actually benefit from but that's
likely a product of like our anthropo
our anthropometric differences like we
have in many different exercises but
that being said i totally agree with
mike the majority of your bicep training
should absolutely i mean almost
exclusively be supinated curls because
that's going to have the best uh sfr for
the bicep specifically and then
everything else is covered by the
pulling movements you do that being said
if you do have like a bicep emphasized
day let's say you were doing a
specialization program or something
along those lines where biceps was
really kind of the focal point of that
day and maybe you had two or three
exercises what i have found is that you
can include things like hammer curls or
reverse curls after you have done
something that is in a supinated curl
form so you can almost kind of treat it
like a pre-fatigue and as mike said like
if you do like easy bar reverse curls
it's a grip exercise for people who are
fresh right but if you pre-fatigue it a
little bit and you have a reasonable
grip strength or you're using something
like a versa grip you can act and some
some people like myself included and i
have like stretch armstrong arms can
actually hit all of those mev ghetto
indicators using that exercise now i
think that's more of an exception than a
rule so if you are somebody who is long
and lenky like me you might actually
find those to be useful but i think most
of you most if not all of your bicep
training should be in that supinated
form it's just it's hard to argue
against like yeah
in all aspects it's like
you're going to tell me that like
reverse curls or hammer curls are really
going to present a better stimulus in
terms of like tension range of motion
and also like if you guys have ever done
hammer curls as part of a block
you can only do a hammer curl so long
before your forearms are like fuck this
well also your fucking
rowing and vertical pulling movements
start to be like oh my god like this is
too much
um i won't say at the end of the day i
think
james and i have tried so much shit
diligently when we were younger that we
can at least
see other we saw a lot of other people
try it it just never worked guys i've
seen people hammer curl and tear with
blue in the face i never seen a
motherfucker that was like man i you
know you see people squat and then they
have much bigger legs that makes sense
the camera curls now it's just not doing
it or reverse curls like yeah you get
some cool shit out of them but they're
not going to magically change your arms
to be much bigger it's just not a thing
yeah it's certainly not as a primary
movement right it's like maybe if you
have a if you have some extra biceps
uh sets in the tank okay i can see that
but not as not as like okay let me let
me get warmed up and hit these reverse
curls right off the bat no way come on
yeah 100
uh all right next up is julie menken
julie let's see
a female on our channel
purely asks
hi docs why do i feel my triceps more
than lats in a straight arm pulldowns am
i doing something wrong is there
something i can do to improve the
movement of my muscle connection
so
the
long head of your triceps is highly
involved in that exercise no big deal
that's great
um you can play around with uh your hand
position some people like wider narrower
and they feel the lats more triceps less
and you can play around with completely
locked elbows or soft elbows and see
which one works best
and you can also play around with if
your hands are like this if your hands
are like this or if you have the rope
dildo things or even if you have an
attachment that looks like that and see
which one of those seems to hit your
lats more and your triceps less some of
those correct answers could be where you
find your best sfrs for the lats but i
would say don't worry about your triceps
uh they'll be getting uh bigger and all
will be well anyway
nailed it mike this is like an
interesting individualization question
too so when so i'll tell you how i
prefer to do it and then i'm curious
because because we're built so
differently so i'm wondering if we have
overlap or for different so for me i
have to go narrow and like hard lockout
in order for it to not for in order for
triceps not to be limiting what about
for you
oh hilariously almost the opposite
lighter and with soft elbows and i feel
my last shit load that's so interesting
for those of you who probably haven't
gathered yet mike and i are as polar
opposite builds as it gets mike's a
little bit more short and stocky i'm
like long and lanky so
there you go so if you're if you're more
like me maybe try hard elbows narrow and
if you're more like mike maybe go soft
elbows a little bit wider and if you're
somewhere in the middle maybe somewhere
in the middle between those
recommendations
all right next up
oh hold up well
let's go to the guy right below there
michael concepcion no no no sorry i'm
sorry michael concepcion
um s john mcgregor who has lots of
upvotes but their algorithm missed as
usual
all right
s john mcgregor asks dear docs
is there any logic to the notion that
training heavier within reason during a
cut could lead to increased muscle
retention and smaller muscle groups with
faster recovery times no
surely the body would be less likely to
cut muscle from areas experiencing
greater acute stress
sure
but that's by no means clear that
heavier accomplishes that better than
lighter and higher volume and the
greater acute stress also might mean
that you can't train as much during a
cut because you exceed your mrv right
away
yep
would the faster stretch fibers not also
be sensitized at the end of the last
meso of accumulation after focusing more
on burn techniques than deloading nope
they would be sensitized less
less they actually get desensitized from
that kind of training
asking for a friend obviously i would
never willingly open myself up
john mcgregor you're the fucking man no
great question and you know honestly
honest to god people have been saying
uh
you gotta train lighter when you're
cutting other people have been saying
gotta train everywhere when you're
cutting to put not to put too fine a
point on it but the people who say you
got to train really heavy when you're
cutting are like people who are
quote-unquote evidence-based and not
jacked even for naturals
hopefully shots fired yeah and then the
people who
uh people who say that you should
train lighter when cutting are generally
on average more like they're taking a
shitload of steroids and they would
the antioxidants would make them so dry
that would hurt if they go heavy um
generally speaking you train the same
way when you're cutting as when you're
uh as when you're matching but i will
say that the scales for the average
person tip a little bit more into the
slightly higher reps when you're cutting
because it reduces injury risk it can
allow you to add reps instead of adding
load as a progression method which
better uh is a better attune to the
slower isoform expression of the fiber
types when you're chronically high
fatigued and low calorie so
i would actually say going a little uh
on the higher rep side is a bit better
when cutting you can go a little bit
heavier during massing if later at the
end of the day sfr sfr sfr if you're
getting great sfrs that's the answer
we've experienced some pretty decent
theoretical grounds for
slightly worse sfrs for really happy
movements when cutting slightly higher
ones for those movements when massing if
they're still not heavy um
remember in a this was a really cool
thing that air accounts said
uh he said this a bunch but um
sorry i can't name a specific podcast or
something but
i think it was one of our discussions
even he was like you know
uh i used to think all kinds of stuff
that was just like sorry for what the
evidence-based guy said but then we as a
community and myself as a person
realized that some stuff we were saying
maybe actually
isn't true and he's like it took me a
while to come around to the idea that
like training
heavy during a cut to save muscle
just
doesn't seem to at least make positive
sense it's not that it makes negative
sense and is actively wrong is it's not
clear to me that that's a good idea
another debate was you know should you
try to hang on to intensity or hang on
the volume when you're cutting and i
think that's what eric was answering he
was like i think volume one that one
like if you start doing like one to two
sets and going ultra heavy you just lose
a load of muscle it's not training
enough and you can't go heavy anyway
because you're so fucking weak so it's
like
it's exactly what you can't do is using
a really shitty gun for which you don't
even have bullets anymore so
i think volume on that one multiple sets
you know this is the question is clearly
set equated and i would say slightly
lighter is usually a better bet for if
nothing else injury if nothing else ego
you experience a decrease more in
strength than you do in repetition
ability when you're cutting so at least
that is uh something that can keep you
going psychologically because we know
physiologically the roughly equivalent
yeah absolutely i'm glad you went there
i was going to kind of touch on that too
like just brought broad strokes like as
mike said you train the same on both but
if you're going to buy us in one
direction i'm cutting i usually would
and this is just a practical
recommendation it's not like a hard line
like this is what the literature says
it's just in my experience if you're
cutting you bias a little bit towards
the lighter end not a lot of bit just a
little bit and when you're massing you
buy us a little bit towards the heavier
end you play to the strength of the
situation when you're cutting you're
fatigued you're not going to be able to
use as much intensity and fucking
hypertrophy training you have a huge
spectrum of intensity in which you can
hypertrophy the muscles so why make it
unnecessarily difficult when you're
massing your recovery ability goes
through the roof because of all that
you're eating so you can actually
tolerate doing those heavier loads and
they might be marginally more
stimulative per repetition
so it's a good time to think about going
a little bit heavier so just broad
strokes cutting maybe bias a little
lighter massing maybe bias a little bit
heavier
one last question
all right the seal
the bas should do it
oh god what have i done
there he is oh he's at the bottom how
did he get so low isn't that crazy and
he has five enough votes what's this
lisa simpson liberal
that says yikes
yikes anyway guess she's outraged about
something yeah i think we spoke about
ein rand and probably wrestled for
jimmy's so this is kind of related
let's see
leia says sorry if it's too much with
the personal questions but i gotta at
least try after hearing that tremendous
ein rand miss over the months and i
don't even remember much of what i said
probably for the best you run out of
pretty good one
yeah that's funny because a few people
got uh ultra triggered um
it's it's hilarious uh over the months
and hundreds of non-rp quote-unquote
original videos like podcasts and
associated content uh consumed i've
grown to believe that social mental uh
philosophical and psychological models
that comprise the underpinnings of what
mike israel as we know him is are
valuable for each and every person not
familiar with them
thanks vasil that's a help stretch
i i i work out of a basement for seo i'm
hardly a person to look up to but in any
case
could you please share sports science
could you please share sports science
stuff aside i'm reading my screen wrong
there we go
um what makes you you i'm talking stuff
like the books from
thomas soule stephen pinker and iran we
need more of that shit to balance out
with the sports science knowledge so two
things one i probably can't give you a
whole lot of that shit and i'll tell you
why um at rp we run an inclusive
for-profit business and if we share
incredibly iconic classic political
views then we get less business and we
make less money and that's bad mostly
because we just don't get to help as
many people that otherwise would be
customers that would get great results
and they just avoid the fuck out of us
because they don't like our politics but
you know politics is a personal thing um
but i will say so you know i don't you
know what makes me me is
largely genetics but i will say
i think what this i can speak for myself
and james james correct me if i'm wrong
on what i'm about to splurge on
i think what unites a lot of the folks
at rp uh and myself and james more
specifically
um
is that we are really really huge huge
huge fans
uh by the way this applies to charlie
and jared as well um critical thinking
um we are huge fans of
the idea that
the truth about the world
is uh
something that's probably out there in
the world
and that you can have a mental model
that reflects it incrementally better or
worse
and you should probably invest a
considerable amount of time and effort
into
making sure that you are trying your
best to get as close to the truth as
possible in whatever endeavor you choose
and it's so easy to get carried away in
myth and desire and virtue and all these
other things and you end up missing the
reality of what's going on
um and you know critical thinking taken
to that extreme of no ideas are beyond
criticism no ideas are beyond accepting
even if they are pretty nasty
implications even if you can't talk
about them though a huge fraction of the
political beliefs james and i have we
will never discuss on the current
version of the internet because they're
so goddamn cancelable you have no idea
the thing is a huge fraction of
americans people all over the world are
in that camp as well it's just a lot of
shit you can't talk about we live in an
interesting arrows i have kind of kind
of coined the term neo-victorianism
where like there's all sorts of ideas
you can have and if you share publicly
you get essentially like the modern
analog of
dare you it's like if you were a
scallywag poor person with rags and mud
and you walked into a victorian ballroom
oh heavens oh well you are not a good
person people just color that shit with
their own ideas about what's true and
they layered in um so i think you know
it's best for folks to try to get at
what they really think is the objective
truth and use the tools of critical
thinking steven pinker just published
another fucking killer book which i'm
making my way through called rationality
rationality bro it's out get it it's
fucking sweet get it in written form not
an audio book this is too goddamn hard
to read an audio book and really like
perseverance i won't read it i don't
read
uh then get it in audio versus the
second best it's better than nothing
right because he has some some examples
to think about you'd have to pause it
i'd really like to see it on a sheet of
paper but but in any case um
you like you know stephen pinker's great
for that sort of thing
um we could probably i'll give you guys
another this is the last thing i'll say
about this matter
my view of the world and probably
james's can be best summed up with an
article that you can google
uh called critical thinking what is it
good for in fact what is it by howard
gabanesh
it is the single best article i have
ever seen written on the entire internet
you will read it and if it upsets you
good because that probably means you're
wrong about some shit if you really like
it good invest into becoming more like
what the article says
and it's it's the ultimate critical
thinking article it is a godsend i don't
know i try to i can't even google the
guy anymore i have no idea where he is i
want to go to his house and give him
flowers or some shit or like a lot of
money and be like god damn it you should
be in charge but it's just phenomenal
article telling you about critical
thinking is composed of skills
world views and values as a critical
thinker you can be very skilled at being
mentally very smart but your world view
about how things work might be
inaccurate or your values of what really
is important to you and how should you
act in situations in which there's
mystery could be off and you know you
see a lot of real smart people have
wacky wacky fucking ideas when their
worldies and values are off or you see
people with legal rules and values
people don't know how to critically
think they don't know a lot of logical
fallacies they'll commit them all the
time but we all commit the fallacies
every now and again but if you have a
value of saying to yourself i'm the kind
of person
that if someone points out to me in good
faith i'm committing logical fallacy i'm
gonna try to change that shit i want to
really know how things are because once
we know how things really are
then we can fucking talk about what to
do about them uh and
and that's ultimately if you're not on
that bandwagon respect no worries but
you're probably gonna not understand a
whole lot of what's going on in life and
as technological progress speeds up here
in the next 10 to 20 years you're really
not going to understand the fuck is
going on and you'll probably vote for
candidates that'll make us progressively
not as well off as we could have been
and that's my spiel james that did i put
you in a camp you don't want to be in or
what oh no not at all and i i tend to be
in the same conundrum that mike is where
i i have plenty of views and i would
love to share them and i think people
would find them valuable that sounds
egotistical but whatever um
but at the same time i have put some of
my i haven't even put any of my views
out there like literally i got roasted
more than a few times for just posting
on instagram saying like i read this
book and people are like oh my god you
fucking nazi
and so that's one of many reasons why i
don't do that kind of stuff anymore just
because it just brings so much like
negative attention and the thing is it's
like it's unclear to me how much of that
is people who are truly outraged versus
people who just want to be outraged
versus people who are just russian
provocateurs versus bots versus like
right and he's provocateurs like yes
russia's done they're like fuck it we'll
let china keep doing it
it's so crazy um so
uh mike and i obviously share a lot of
our um interests and books and and
movies and intellectual thinkers uh on
my if you if you really give a shit how
what i think um if you go to my
instagram and my bio i have a link to
things that i find very influential in
the way that i think on there so there's
a big list of books and movies and comic
books and anime and all sorts of stuff
so uh i can't really share it without
risking rp getting cancelled
is the times we live in
yeah but hopefully my sports science
views keeps us keeps us rolling for now
and i don't say anything stupid which i
mean who knows at this point i'm
one of the things that mike probably
knows me best for is saying the wrong
thing at the right time we have a name
for it it's called jamesing yourself
yeah i just was
notorious in our in our in grad school
for just like talking shit about people
when they're standing right behind me
just like classic james move oh i loved
every minute of it
all right i think we're going to wrap
this one up for this week so let's see
um i don't there's a lot of like uh
[Music]
just you know uh classified rp documents
right now so i'm not really sure how
much i can talk about there are several
projects underway
man i don't think i can talk about any
of them but definitely interesting
things coming um
there's a major project underway that i
can't really talk about but like i said
before it's preventing one of our
preventing one of our books from being
released so you can imagine that
pretty important um dr mike you got
anything going on that you can disclose
uh no but things are in the pipeline
bunch of great videos so folks go watch
the video this week about um
just came out recently loose in
and stretch marks and what to do about
that with dieting because that's a big
deal
people ask about it a lot it's a pretty
popular video so go boost the algorithm
god damn it lamborghinis don't buy
themselves
i thought you were going to say check
out the video on loose in the caboose
also do that just google that i don't
know
all right i think that's it for this
week folks thanks for all the upvotes we
had a whole whole lot like 70 on some of
the questions that was really awesome so
again for those of you who are kind of
new tuning in to dr mike and my nonsense
uh always just scan the previous week's
q a and then just see if there's any
questions that you really liked or you
thought were really interesting and if
you find those give them an upvote and
then if there's any that you
or excuse me if there's any questions
that are kind of unresolved or you have
questions that didn't come up go ahead
and pop them in and hopefully people
will give you that same courtesy and
upvote your questions and we'll get to
them
boom peace homies that's it see you guys
