Hey guys, Sean Nalewanyj here, BodyTransformationTruth.com,
I wanted to address what I think is a pretty
important topic today, I have seen other fitness
channels discuss it so I just wanted to give
you my thoughts, and that is to be cautious
and to be aware of what’s actually going
on when you try to compare your physique to
the physiques of people that you see in magazines,
fitness models, top natural bodybuilders,
and even just certain people that you see
on youtube, who very high levels of muscular
development along with very low body fat relative
to most other people.
You have to keep in mind that those physiques
that you see are actually extremely rare and
they represent the absolute upper percentile
of what is naturally achievable, but the problem
is that because of the internet and because
of the sort of rise of social media, we’re
constantly seeing those physiques over and
over and over again which might trick your
mind into thinking that they're a lot more
common than they actually are.
Those people that you see with exceptionally
muscular bodies, who can deadlift 600 pounds
yet also have a ripped six pack all year round,
generally have the best of the best when it
comes to genetics which despite what some
people might say does play a pretty significant
role in all of this.
Secondly, when you see a lot of those professional
photos online, keep in mind that in most cases
those people specifically prepared themselves
for that photo shoot by getting much leaner
than they normally are, by using perfect lighting
and angles, by having a pump, and then even
with all of that on their side, taking hundreds
of photos and then selecting the ones that
make them look as good as possible.
And third, also keep in mind that a lot of
these people, again, natural bodybuilders,
fitness models and even some people on youtube,
for a lot of them, their entire life basically
revolve around fitness and it’s where most
of their energy goes, and that's just not
practical or even desirable for a lot of people,
and on top of that they’ve also probably
been training a lot longer than you have,
and then even on top of all of that, a certain
percentage of those people who claim that
they’re natural aren’t even natural and
they actually are using drugs without telling
people about it.
So, this is not meant to be discouraging and
whatever your goals truly are then by all
means you should aim for them, I’m certainly
not saying that you can’t achieve that type
of body, all I’m saying is that, don’t
allow yourself to feel bad just because you
don’t have the body of a fitness model or
a top natural bodybuilder, or at least you
don’t have it yet if you do feel that you
have the potential for that and you are aiming
for that.
Again not only are those physiques exceptionally
rare on a global scale, but a lot of what
you see online is not even what those people
actually look like in person, or at least
not all the time.
And the problem is that as humans we have
this sort of cognitive bias, where we rate
ourselves not in terms of what we’ve actually
objectively achieved but instead in comparison
to what others have achieved, and so it’s
possible to actually look really good and
be strong and be healthy and then still feel
bad about yourself because you’re always
comparing yourself to the very highest achievers.
The actual fact is, if you’re someone who
simply goes to the gym and trains hard consistently
and eats well a good percentage of the time,
you’re already way ahead of the game when
it comes to fitness.
I’m not trying to negatively judge anybody
but just giving some perspective here, the
average person does not workout, does not
watch what they eat and is either overweight
or skinny fat.
That’s the average person.
And if you just walk down the street and take
a look around you that’s what you're mostly
going to see.
And for some people that’s totally fine
because not everybody is pre-occupied with
having a great physique and they might have
other areas of their life where most of their
focus goes, but, as someone who does care
about their health and their fitness, be realistic
about your own achievements and recognize
that if you have reasonably low body fat,
and you have decent muscular development along
with decent strength levels, you're already
in significantly better shape than the vast
majority of the population out there.
And that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t
strive for more, but if you’re going to
compare yourself to people in this area, which
admittedly is a bit of a trap in the first
place, but if you are going to compare yourself
to other people, then compare yourself to
the entire population at large because that's
going to give you a much more accurate perspective
as to how much you’ve actually achieved,
and that while aiming higher is fine, it’s
important to give yourself credit for where
you’re at right now instead of just letting
your mind focus in on that tiny fraction of
a fraction of people who depending on where
you live will very rarely ever even see in
your day to day life.
So just keep that in mind, don’t let your
perception be skewed, if you’re putting
in the effort on a consistent basis both in
and out of the gym and you’re getting results
and you're making positive moves towards your
goals, then you should be proud of yourself
for that alone.
