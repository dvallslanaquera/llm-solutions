then
my name is marisa inba i am 43 years old
i compete in
a usapl ipf powerlifting i'm a five-time
national champion one time world
[Music]
champion
i actually started lifting when i was 17
years old i come from a gymnastics
background
and once i stopped being competitive in
that i needed something to do and i just
uh
contoured into a gym one day and i've
been addicted ever since and that was at
17 years old
and oddly enough i always just find it
funny that this day and age like
girls always talk about feeling
intimidated walking into a gym with men
back then there was like no girls in the
weight room and i was really welcomed
with open arms like the guys were like
you know not hitting on me or anything
crazy like that like the cool this is
exciting let's just show her
how to lift weights and put a barbell in
my hand and i've been doing it ever
since
the very first time when i walked into
that weight room one of the guys
afterwards was like hey i can tell like
you could
probably do very well in bodybuilding
you should do a bodybuilding
competition there's you know here's a
flyer and you know here's the ones that
they're at
got a flex magazine and i you know
stupidly at that time i just followed
one of like
one of the bodybuilding guys routines
which was like a gazillion the sets and
reps and nearly died
but that was kind of like the first
hardest workout i had ever done
following some program that i probably
had no business following
and you know just loved it and then just
started refining it from there just
based on
you know common sense earliest memory
was my first competition so right as i i
started
uh weight training i signed up for a
bodybuilding show and it was like
colorado
teen you know championships and i
started getting ready for that i
honestly didn't really know what i was
doing because i was still kind of
learning everything reading
so that first show i spilled over is
what they would call it where i carved
up a little bit too much
but because there was not a lot of
competition especially a 17 year old
girl
i of course won and then i kind of got
addicted to that and then started just
okay this is what i did for this one
what do i need to do for the next one
and
i just started competing in bodybuilding
and loved it and
i probably loved it to a point to a
fault
where i was like okay if i was working
or at school like oh i can't stay past
for this
lab gotta go to the gym it actually
almost became like a very strange
addiction in that way whereas like my
focus was 100
on that i realized very quickly that i
was definitely not going to be
competitive with
the other females in the sport
especially as i aged out of the teen
division because
i wasn't doing drugs and that's when
drug use started to get very big
and i just wasn't competitive last show
i did
before i switched over to powerlifting
was junior usa's and just got
annihilated just because
i was nowhere near lean enough and it
stopped being fun at that point because
i knew i could never win
[Music]
so powerlifting happened after i had my
kids i had
i was still always training because i
loved the gym i loved it that much that
even though i wasn't competing i always
loved
going to the gym i was just in the gym
training this was probably like
three years after i had my son and i was
a flyer for california state games and i
was like oh cool i've always been kind
of strong because i've always
lifted with a barbell and dumbbells
always been free weight lifter
just signed up for it knew nothing about
it and was still training as a
bodybuilder
just had zero idea of what i was getting
myself into because i never went to
watch a power lifting meet
and um just jumped into a meet and just
did it and actually walked away with
like all the california state records
for the weight class and
i did a couple more meets by myself i
was able to make it to
worlds in south africa on my own and
after that that's when i had you know
instagram was kind of getting really
popular and i saw
chad wesley smith juggernaut and got in
touch with him and
then he took over my coaching from there
first time powerlifting pushed back at
me
is um when i was trying to
simultaneously
thinking i was wanted to cut down a
weight class and do a physique show
and i this is my first national meet and
i bombed out on squats
i was cutting depth you know it's a very
humbling experience
to bomb out at a national meet when you
know kind of people are starting to talk
oh like this is the girl that could give
suzanne hartwig
a little bit of run for money but nope
you bomb out and um and then that kind
of gets in your head confidence-wise
that was like the first time
i really felt wow okay this could not go
well and then what
the biggest hardship i've had is right
after worlds in 2017 so
that was the year that i won the world
championships i won the grand prix at
the arnold so it was like wow okay
everything is going
really good right after that meat
couldn't bend over couldn't tie my shoe
and i'm like oh my god we got on a plane
then got on a train and i think it was
just
heavy lifting combined with sitting for
like 10 hours and my sciatic just
started flaring up and i couldn't bend
over and i honestly thought okay maybe
this might be like a six to eight
week kind of ordeal it turned into it's
been an ongoing ordeal for
the last two years and so i've just been
able to find workarounds that have
worked for me
to still continually make progress but
then als to also make me feel like i'm
you know moving forward instead of
moving backwards
[Music]
my most memorable greatest moment was at
the 2017 arnold
grand prix i went nine for nine at that
meet i set the all-time world record
total at that time
and um it was the best meet ever i
i mean even though the all-time world
record got broken like two weeks later
just to to set it at that time
and it just it was amazing to be number
one it makes you feel like all the hard
work that you've put into something all
the sacrifices
this is a sacrifice i've made since i
was 17 years old to have my mom be like
well if you invested as much time in
you know school or your job you could be
a ceo and it's like
okay but i'm investing time in something
that i love and i'm number one at it so
it has not been a waste of time
i think the biggest thing that the being
involved in powerlifting has changed for
me
has been um the ability to continually
push myself
um i don't think people realize how
scary it is to stand in front of
419 pound deadlift when you're 114
pounds
coming back from like even a back injury
and to be able to like
go there and mentally have the the
mental fortitude to just make it happen
i can take that mindset to any part of
my life
my biggest bit of wisdom that i can pass
along to anyone is whatever
it is you choose to do be consistent in
that activity
if you want to lose weight and have
six-pack abs be consistent in your
nutrition and with your diet
if you want to be a better lifter you
have to be consistent in the gym putting
in the work consistency
is king over anything that you do in
life
i will train the day i die i trained a
couple hours before i gave birth to both
of my kids like
training for me is the best stress
reliever
it's if you're battling depression
training is the best thing that you can
do for yourself so i will always train
you
