[Music]
yo what's up youtube we are back in the
1980s
doing 1980s training but
it's back
so we're back in the 80s training back
charlie has a little more complex split
he already trained a little bit of push
look at how big he is isn't that tasty
um
korean boys
make me make that korean noise
all right in any case we are going to do
what's that shit called pullover machine
the original nautilus blower we get that
in a sec then we're going to do assisted
pull-ups also not all that's also the
best system machine ever made and then
we are going to do some
uh
chess supported rows chessboard
the chess supported bros you thought i
was gonna say another word let's do it
in order to be fit everyone knows you
have to
think fit let's see about the different
ways in which you can think about
fitness
done with your workout you got a little
water
in hand and you're kind of throwing a
little seduction face like oh i've got a
towel maybe we could
uh what else
this guy's like ah i'm doing
maybe a barbell press maybe a pull down
unclear
she's actually working out
nice it's nice nice lady um i love the
shorts they're really 80s and then this
guy is like ooh yeah
and uh oh i think he's doing leg
extensions but clearly not hard enough
because he's having a good time speaking
of good times
the nautilus
pullover a classic
we're trying to rig it uh jared seems to
be getting a
a good bit of uh
stimulus from this charlie and i are not
so sure we'll do a couple more sets
decent stimulus maybe not the best we're
having some trouble with the seat height
and stuff you know in your own training
it's really important to arrange the
machine in such a way that
is optimal
a big tip is don't just go with what
everyone else is doing really try to fit
it to your body so if you get a machine
it doesn't feel good but as a seat and
chest adjustment and stuff like that
really really play with it uh over even
it's some sometimes weeks
trying different angles and stuff to see
where it fits best it could take a
machine that you think is like bad this
is awful and make it in a machine that's
actually great so hopefully that happens
for charlie and i in the following
couple sets let's get it done uh sets of
10 to 20 reps three to four sets and
then we move on to assistive pull-ups
[Music]
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
works out good job man
they're pretty strong brother i don't
know man i felt that mostly in my
glenohumeral joint for real yeah
i don't really feel this in my lat at
all yeah i mean i'm feeling them but you
know maybe i'm just better at this than
you guys
training i mean no i get it
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that was fake failure
oh
all right we're done
[Music]
the nautilus
gravitron assisted pull-up maybe the
best assisted pull-up ever made why
ultra-grippy handles full range of
motion abilities unless your waist is
bigger than 58 inches or whatever
and then um the way the cam system is
designed as with most nautilus equipment
is it actually makes the movement much
harder at the bottom than at the top
which is a really good idea if you're
after hypertrophy because stretch under
load is a really good idea and also
because
mechanically you are very disadvantaged
at the top the way your muscles are
arranged in limbs so it ends up being
that machines are with assisted pull-ups
that are even the force curve is okay
it's pretty good
force curve that's how heavy at the
bottom easier at the top is really close
to optimum
machines that are arranged the other way
and if you do your pull-ups
unfortunately with bands for assistance
easier at the bottom harder at the top
is actually backwards to what you need
both for a hypertrophic stimulus and
even to match the force curve you know
that sort of thing we're going to do
this for sets of 10 to 20 reps probably
like four or five sets because this is a
dub bomb did people still say that as
saying to bomb cool comment below
asking the follower scott not you you're
from the 90s
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
ah this machine is so incredible
it even pulls the seat forward at the
bottom just stretch your lats out more
unreal
come
on yeah
how many was that jared 12 dude that's
the shit
uh
[Music]
come on jared
crystal's bro voice is incredible
[Music]
oh yes
[Music]
all
right i've got like five sets of
assisted pull-ups
amazing machine my lats are like out of
control pumped i'm like
resting my arms on them i've got
real imaginary lat syndrome
so doubt it
what let me pick up an emg
huh let me hook up an emg no no i've got
let's biomechanics thing i do okay
so now we're gonna do
the chest supported row with full rom of
course
rounding at the bottom arching at the
top to get the whole back not that
focused back focused
let's get into it
three to four sets 10 to 20 reps
bake time
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
oh
that's a good stretch
[Music]
wow
[Music]
[Music]
ugh
oh shit
oh damn that was a fucking angle
holy balls
i felt so goddamn good
you doing one more
are you serious yeah you need a big back
idiot dude
you shut the fuck up it's not gonna
happen what do you mean we need two
fucking plates 225 sure the fuck is that
going to do for me
make you big
shout out
charlie can i borrow your mic
we laugh between sets not very sad
let's go jared
there you go
cardinal rule of being jacked
always lean on something
standing up by yourself is hard
hard work
good session
good we texted each other last night and
i was like oh my god what are you going
to wear and they're like only
black gray and red
okay
and so we did except for my shoes baby
why
chris you got money like me you got a
what's that called
with a
uh not ball out show out
something something show about something
something you guys know rap music anyway
team for rom
hey
see jared get in here baby we're a team
one two three full rom
anyway see you guys next time
[Music]
you
