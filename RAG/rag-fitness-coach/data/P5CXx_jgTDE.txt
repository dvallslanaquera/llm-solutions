this is how most people train their rear
delts they sit down grab the handles and
pull the weight back but there's a
better way instead of facing the machine
turn side on this will pull your rear
delt into a much deeper stretch as you
do your reps your chest is going to try
to point toward the machine so make sure
you brace with your other hand and point
your chest to the side facing
perpendicular to the machine from here
sweep the weight out one arm at a time
now depending on the machine you may
come up solid halfway through but that's
okay because the stretched part of the
lift is more important anyway just make
sure you still push the set hard
