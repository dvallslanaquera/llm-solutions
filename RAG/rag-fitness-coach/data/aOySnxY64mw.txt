i'd say that if you took everything
alpha-m recommends in terms of
calorie surplus numbers protein numbers
and weight gain numbers
and just cut them all in half that would
be a much better approach
for almost everyone if you want to do
your lean bulk the right way
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and today i'm going to be responding to
an alpha m video entitled
get bigger without getting fat lean
bulking tricks
so this guy is basically like a
self-improvement coach of sorts he also
gives out fitness information
he's got over six million subscribers so
obviously a lot of people watch his
videos
personally i find him very difficult to
watch he's always screaming at the
camera and has this really
forced over-the-top persona you gotta
eat big to get big boys and today i'm
gonna teach you the secrets
to get jacked and a lot of his videos
are basically just like infomercials
where he spends half the time giving
advice and then the other half pitching
all kinds of different products i'm
going to turn around over here
i'm going to put it in this machine
right over there
set it so i personally find this channel
pretty damn cringy but that's just my
own opinion and it's beside the point
anyway
let's go over the video and critique the
actual information
piece by piece where he shares his
advice on proper lean bulking
some of the advice is okay some of it is
[ __ ] so let's break this down piece by
piece and go over which parts are
okay and which parts are [ __ ] but the
reality is that dirty bulking
does not work so he actually starts the
video off on a good note
by saying that dirty bulking is a bad
idea which i completely
agree with and it's something i've
talked about many times before in my
previous videos
problem with dirty bulking is that the
calories that you're consuming
is way above where you need them to be
in order to
safely and reasonably pack on muscle and
the result
is you're gonna get sloppy fat yes if
you eat in too large of a calorie
surplus
um which is basically what dirty bulking
boils down to and you're just stuffing
your face all day with high calorie food
and weight gain shakes
trying to gain mass as quickly as
possible what's that stuff
weight gain four thousand is helping me
bulk up
um like this idiot here did back in 2009
getting up to
230 pounds at five foot nine and then
spending the next five months having to
cut back down
if you do that you are going to end up
fat it's really that simple
there's a limit on how many calories
your body can use for lean muscle growth
per day
and once you go beyond that all of those
extra calories are just going to go
straight to your fat stores
you will look worse you will feel worse
and then you're gonna have to spend a
bunch of time dieting all that fat off
later on so
that's good advice to start and he then
goes on to recommend that you start by
taking pictures of yourself
and weighing yourself so that you can
track your progress which i also
recommend doing
i also if possible would love for you to
have your body fat checked
you can do that if you really want i
don't think it's necessary for most
people
the problem is that most methods for
measuring body fat have a pretty large
margin for error and if you're not
getting
perfectly consistent readings then it
just might throw you off overall
i think if you're following a proper
clean bulking approach you're measuring
your body weight you're taking pictures
measuring your waistline that's usually
enough to successfully put on muscle
while keeping body fat gains minimized
and you don't need to worry about
specifically measuring your exact body
fat percentage
the second step is to figure out how
many calories you need
right now and that is your basal
metabolic rate that's not quite accurate
basal metabolic rate is actually the
number of calories that your body
requires
at complete rest for natural processes
like breathing and digestion
and circulation if you want to know your
actual calorie maintenance level
then you have to calculate your basal
metabolic rate and then use an activity
multiplier on top of that to account for
all the extra activity that you're doing
throughout the day
he then goes on to recommend a calorie
calculator this calculator is amazing
it's going to tell you how many calories
you need at rest but then
it's also going to help you figure out
how many calories you need in addition
to pack on massive sexy muscle so this
is fine if you have
absolutely no idea what your calorie
maintenance level is
but just keep in mind that all online
calculators are only rough estimates
because there are just so many different
factors that are going to influence
exactly how many calories you're burning
per day
and an online calculator can't take all
those factors into account
so you can use a calculator to get an
approximate starting point
but you're then going to need to go
ahead and apply it in the real world
see how your weight changes and then
adjust your calories from there i mean
if you need some help with this then you
can head over to shawnell.com custom
once this video is over
um the link is up here and down below in
the description box just fill out the
form on that page and i'll personally
configure
your individual calorie needs based on
your body stats and goals as
accurately as i can and i'll also give
you a sample meal plan
based on that calorie amount as well as
a complete step-by-step training program
to go along with it so along with the
calculator he tells you to go to his
recommended supplement page
that he obviously earns affiliate
commissions off of there you're gonna
find my list for the top 10
best supplements to build a better body
and i'll come back to that at the end of
the video
to explain um which options he lists out
are actually worthwhile
and which ones are a waste of money for
the next four weeks you're consuming an
additional 500 calories per day not a
thousand
500. so alpha m recommends finding your
maintenance calories
and then adding 500 calories on top of
that in order to lean bulk
now this is not terribly bad advice you
know if he recommended
750 or a thousand calories above
maintenance then that would be
much worse but a 500 calorie surplus is
still beyond what your body can actually
utilize for muscle growth
in a single day now i recognize that all
calorie calculations are just
estimations
and most people out there are not going
to be tracking their calories
right down to the precise amount but if
you did truly eat
500 calories above maintenance every
single day you would end up gaining more
fat than you truly need to
i would say that that's roughly twice as
many calories as you actually require
and that for most people with average
genetics around
200 to 300 calories per day is really
all you need in order to
fully maximize muscle growth it really
doesn't take nearly as many calories to
build muscle effectively
as most people think and if you yourself
have done a successful lean bulk in the
past then let me know down below in the
comments
what nutrition approach you personally
used um or if you're just getting
started and you have any other questions
about this then feel free to ask them
below as well and i'll be happy to help
out
i mean if you are enjoying this video so
far then don't forget to hit that like
button below and let me know
i also want these calories to be
primarily protein primarily protein you
can have some fats and carbs but
primarily
protein the truth is that you really
don't need that much protein
in order to gain muscle at your maximum
potential and protein needs should be
based on your body weight
rather than being a percentage of your
total calories in most cases like i've
said many times before about 0.8 grams
per pound of body weight ideally spread
out over three or more feedings
that should be enough to fully elevate
protein synthesis for the day
if you want to go higher just out of
preference then that's fine you know one
gram per pound of body weight 1.2 grams
that's fine but 0.8 grams should be
enough for maximum gains
unless you're vegan in which case you
might want to go slightly higher
just to be fully safe but maybe this is
the actual reason why he recommends
consuming
so much protein quick delicious easy 200
extra calories gentlemen is a scoop
of signature series whey protein with a
cup of almond milk or skim milk another
super quick and easy option that i love
is protein bars the bodybuilding.com
protein bars the signature series
are the most delicious at night before i
go to bed i will actually take a casein
protein shake now alpha m is obviously
affiliated with bodybuilding.com
and there's nothing wrong with any of
that you know whey casein protein bars
if you want to include any of those in
your diet for convenience sake
or if you just like the taste then go
right ahead i use whey protein
personally
for my breakfast smoothie and in my
oatmeal
as a snack in the evening i've done that
for many many years and real science
athletics which is my own sports
nutrition company
we are working on developing our own
protein powder right now
however also keep in mind that protein
powders are not
a must and if you prefer to just hit
your daily protein needs through solid
foods only then that's totally okay
too there's nothing magical about
protein powders and it really just comes
down to personal preference
now if you've gained less than five
pounds in those four weeks i want you to
take it
to the next step i want you to increase
your daily calories by an additional 500
for the next four weeks so now you're up
a thousand from where you started
so in the beginning of the video he
advises against dirty bulking but then
the actual guidelines that he gives in
the video
are essentially what you would be doing
if you were dirty bulking or at least
let's say
semi-dirty bulking you should not be
gaining five pounds per month
if your goal is to gain muscle while
staying relatively lean at the same time
that's too much
too quickly your body can only build so
much muscle in a given week or month
uh muscle growth is a slow and gradual
process and if you were to continue at
that pace
um and you were putting on you know 15
pounds in three months or 20 pounds in
four months
you're going to get fat trust me i have
been there so just like i recommended
before that instead of eating in a 500
calorie surplus like alpha m recommends
that you should go with a 200 to 300
calorie surplus
i'd also say that instead of aiming for
five pounds of weight gain per month
that should be more like two pounds per
month and three pounds at the most
and then if your weight starts
plateauing add in another
maybe 100 to 200 calories or so not
another 500. in order to get bigger
without getting fat gentlemen it's about
systematically and methodically
increasing
your caloric intake and monitoring your
progress
so i agree with that completely and he
has the right idea here but the actual
method that he's recommending to achieve
that is still not going to be optimal
it's not off the charts terrible you
know there are people out there giving
much
worse advice hey what's up guys it's
thomas delauer
but again i'd say that if you took
everything alpha m recommends in terms
of
calorie surplus numbers protein numbers
and weight gain numbers
and just cut them all in half that would
be a much better approach
for almost everyone if you want to do
your lean bulk the right way
and then as i mentioned before i'm just
going to do a quick summary of his
supplement recommendations because like
i said his channel is
pretty much just a big infomercial and
he seems to promote pretty much anything
and everything he can at
every opportunity so let's quickly go
over this to hopefully save you some
money
if you are an alpha m fan so first is
whey protein
that's fine as i mentioned before not
mandatory but it can be optionally used
if you like
second is a multivitamin this brand here
isn't terrible but it's still not great
it uses zinc oxide which is a really
cheap unabsorbable form of zinc
there's no magnesium which is an
important mineral if you are training
hard and consistently
i'd recommend checking out microcore
which is our real science athletics
multi
um it was tailored specifically for hard
training lifters using the optimal forms
of each vitamin and mineral
in their full clinical doses and i'll
link that up at the top of the screen
and down below in the description box
and you can use coupon code youtube15 to
save 15
off your first order uh if you are
interested in that then he's got
l-carnitine
which is mostly useless for body
composition purposes it's usually used
for fat loss but the research there
is pretty unconvincing creatine
monohydrate that's totally fine
creatine is an effective supplement that
i also recommend
cla almost certainly a complete waste of
money i did a detailed video on cla that
you can look up if you want
it's promoted for fat loss but it
probably won't do anything noticeable
for you and it's definitely one that i
would suggest leaving on the shelf
protein bars and casein no real problem
there same deal as
the whey protein then there's vitamin c
i don't see any real reason to take that
unless you're doing it for some
very specific needs so i would say that
that's optional fish oil is a great
supplement if you don't eat a lot of
fatty fish throughout the week
but the brand that he recommends here
provides fish oil in the ethyl ester
form which is not as absorbable
instead you want to get your fish oil in
the natural triglyceride
form which is what we offer over at real
science athletics with
our o3 prime product and i'll also link
that down below
bcaas most of you know my stance on that
the research is very clear that if
you're eating enough total protein for
the day
they are essentially worthless b complex
if you're already taking a multivitamin
then you don't need extra b vitamins
and lastly mct oil another overhyped but
unnecessary fat loss supplement
so i would say four of the 12
supplements on this list are reasonable
options and the rest are not going to
benefit you
so in summary this alpha m video is not
the worst muscle building advice i've
ever seen
but there are still a lot of problems
with it as i discussed he recommends
against dirty bulking but then he gives
guidelines that are essentially
for a dirty bulk and again if you want
