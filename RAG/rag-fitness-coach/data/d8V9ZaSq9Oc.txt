so in this video i'm asking five highly
qualified nutrition experts about the
most effective science-based strategies
for losing body fat
no matter how you slice it uh the
relapse statistics are still
pretty bad i don't want you to get too
hungry i don't want you to get too full
while none of these strategies are
incorrect necessarily they're also not
required
uh stuff that does in fact increase
energy expenditure
eventually they will come off of that
stubborn area your body
has to pull it from somewhere eventually
so to get everyone on the same page
first i spoke with dr eric helms about
the fat loss fundamentals
eric has published a ton of
science-based papers in peer-reviewed
journals
including recommendations for physique
athletes protein intakes during caloric
restriction
and even binge eating behavior so he
started out by reminding me that on a
physiological level
fat loss is very well understood and
actually quite simple
yep so fat loss comes from an energy
deficit so consuming
less calories than you need to maintain
weight real briefly
you can technically see your body fat
percentage go down eating at maintenance
while you gain muscle
and you could possibly even like if you
had a really strong stimulus to gain
weight
maybe lose or gain muscle i should say
maybe lose
fat in a small surplus perhaps but
energetically
you need to be an energy deficit and on
our call eric emphasized that it isn't
enough to just lose weight
we want to lose as much of that weight
from fat as possible and as little of
that weight from muscle as possible
and to help us do that he laid out five
keys for maximizing fat loss while
preventing muscle loss
and i'll do these in order of importance
so one is got to have the energy deficit
uh the second thing is
well how do we know that what we're
going to lose is fat and the best way to
do that is to stimulate muscle
to stay so that is progressive
resistance exercise so that's the the
best tool we have
after that the next most important thing
is making sure that the size of the
deficit
is appropriate a good general rule of
thumb is somewhere between 0.5 to as
much as 1.5
of your body weight but i wouldn't use
that higher end unless you are pretty
high in body fat
after that you probably want to have a
sufficient protein intake a good rule of
thumb
is i would say higher than 2 grams per
kg and if you are someone
very high in body fat quick rule of
thumb that normally puts you in the
right range so you're not over consuming
based on your lean mass
is to use your centimeters in height
that typically scales pretty well for
most people
and then finally the thing i'd mention
is an appropriate volume of cardio so
you don't want to completely get your
deficit from it and modality and timing
is important here so not right before
training
and you don't want something that has a
ton of high impact or eccentric
components so a lot of running would
probably be not the main choice
decent rule of thumb is make sure that
your volume of cardio
is no more than half of your volume of
resistance training which is something i
pulled out of my butt but it's a decent
line in the sand
and to make it slightly more specific
eric suggested doing no more than 30
minutes of low intensity cardio per day
and no more than one to two high
intensity interval sessions per week
again assuming you're trying to prevent
muscle loss as much as possible so with
the most important variables in place
next i ask eric about the different
types of foods we should eat
there are some foods simply better than
others when it comes to fat loss
a lot of people especially in the
mainstream will obsess over
the types of foods they're eating like
people seem to think these foods are
better for fat loss and these foods are
worse for fat loss where do you stand on
the
it really comes down to hitting the
macros versus
there really are some foods that are
inherently more fat burning
than others both of those statements can
be true in the right context
so it does just come down to macros
however
there is some data that suggests highly
processed foods have a lower tef
so the thermic effect so the energy
output side would be lower
but it would just come down to lowering
your macros even more so it still always
comes down to energy balance
it also comes down to do you want to
make your fat loss process
easier to follow and less likely to
rebound or do you just care about
getting lean for a temporary time period
if it's the latter
and you just don't care about
white-knuckling it then yeah you could
just
lower the deficit track your macros not
worry about it and have some semblance
of variety to make sure you're covering
your micronutrient basis
but that's not most people if they
really think about it so i would
say for enhancing satiety preserving
energy output and general control of
hunger signaling
you probably want to consume mostly
single ingredient food items
and not eating a lot of hyperpalatable
foods but there is a balance to be had
there to where you don't want to make
these foods off limits you need to have
your adult card that's the way you like
to put it like if someone says
you're not allowed to have this anymore
the natural rebellious teenager comes
out so you need to feel like i'm making
a conscious choice i'm a part of these
aren't hard rules this isn't a black and
white approach but most my meals are
going to be
fruits vegetables lean proteins and a
carb source
and then if i feel like it if i really
want to and it would help me actually
follow my diet
sure i'll have a snack or a treat and
i'll work it in so after eric laid out
the fat loss fundamentals
next i spoke with someone who's
extremely specialized in getting people
absolutely shredded cliff wilson is one
of the best natural bodybuilding coaches
on the planet
his clients have won 125 pro cards 87
professional titles
and 13 world championships in natural
bodybuilding and i wanted to get him on
to ask what the difference is between
getting
beach lean and getting ultra shredded
for a competition
i would classify beechling as slightly
six-pack abs
versus you know just absolutely shredded
um a lot of what
gets you there is the same it's just the
degree to which you do it
you can be a little inconsistent and
still get beach lean but you can't
really be inconsistent
and get completely shredded because
every competitor you know when they
start
start their diet for a show they at one
point reach
beach lean and then you just keep going
so i would say
the duration of the diet is probably the
single biggest factor along with the
degree to which you are diligent
now i should say that cliff noted that
he wouldn't necessarily recommend that
you try to get this lien
especially if your main goal is to
improve your health and he agreed that
getting truly shredded
isn't even a sustainable goal for most
people but i did find it interesting
that even in these extreme cases of fat
loss
it still ultimately just boils down to
the same fundamental principles that
eric helms laid out
you just push them a bit further and for
longer but one thing i was curious about
was stubborn fat
are there any tricks for losing that
last bit of fat off body parts that just
won't seem to let go i would say there's
two things first off
generally the more developed a muscle
group is it will look leaner
because if you have a given amount of
fat in a particular area like if
i hold more fat in my shoulders which
some people do if i
build more muscle in my shoulders that
same amount of body fat will be spread
across a larger area
so you will look leaner it's one of the
reasons more muscular people tend to
look leaner in general but beyond that
stubborn body fat is largely going to be
determined by genetics and gender and
things like that so
i would say that if everything leans out
first except for your stubborn area
if you continue to diet eventually they
will come off of that stubborn area
your body has to pull it from somewhere
eventually right
one thing that i've noticed with this is
sometimes you might have someone let's
just say it's a guy who just can't get
the lower abs to show like there's
always a little bit of a
little bit of lower back fat that won't
come off and we can keep dieting them
but at a certain point it almost seems
like they just start really stringing
out or they're i don't know if they're
losing muscle but it's like they're just
so
zapped of energy how do you deal with
that situation that's a tough one as a
coach
usually what will happen is once you
start to tap into that
that stubborn body fat um you've
typically reached the point of
significant discomfort people who have
gotten to that level for the first time
they're probably going to get a little
bit stringier than somebody who's never
gotten to that level because
at the risk of sounding you know
engaging in hyperbole it's very
traumatic
to sometimes try to get that stubborn
body fat off for the first time
and so you are almost bound to lose the
muscle mass you've probably
seen this with competitors over the
years or even with yourself then the
next time you try to do it again
it's almost like you're mentally and
physically prepared for what you're
going to engage in and then you can get
it off the second and third time without
is being as
traumatic either mentally or physically
right right that's super well said okay
great so after talking to cliff about
some intelligent ways to get completely
diced for a competition
next i wanted to speak with someone
who's more focused on sustainable
approaches to fat loss so i got sports
nutritionist so he lee on the line who
did
her master's thesis on the psychology of
eating behavior
she explained a few of the biggest
mental roadblocks people run into
and some of her best tips for women well
i think generally speaking
men and women tend to make a lot of the
same mistakes but what i see a lot
happening a lot
maybe i see it more in women because i
work primarily with women but what i've
seen is that
they don't want to hear about a more
moderate
strategy that they can utilize for their
plan they want to hear
cut out these entire food groups you
can't eat dairy you have to go keto try
intermittent fasting
and as you know while none of these
strategies are incorrect necessarily
they're also not required
in order to see fat loss progress and i
made this mistake to myself for many
many years where i focus more on
what i thought was the perfect plan on
paper but i didn't consider
my current lifestyle and my current
preferences and what would actually be
feasible for me
to consistently execute day after day
after day so what happened
was very common where you get very
excited in the beginning and this is a
very common
psychology mistake that people make
where they rely too much on motivation
in the beginning
they underestimate how difficult some
journey will actually be
and then one weekend two weeks and three
weeks in they quit
and then they're on to the next thing
right and i think we call it
shiny object syndrome so they're always
looking for the next fad diet the next
cool thing that sounds interesting
rather than oh
well what tweaks can i make to my
current lifestyle to nudge me in the
right direction over time
and throughout our conversations so he
emphasized how important it is to create
repeatable habits so you don't need to
be so reliant on self-control
for every decision about food so there's
always this idea that if you want
something you have to just try
harder right or if you fail on your
goal it's because you didn't have enough
self-control the research consistently
shows that self-control is very very
helpful
in the initial formation of habits but
it should not be utilized as a
ongoing strategy for long-term behavior
change
and the key feature of a habit unlike
self-control
it does not require cognitive effort for
the habit to take place
so if we go into your kitchen or your
home environment your work environment
wherever you spend a lot of time
are there things we can change around to
make
maybe the higher calorie the more
calorie dense foods
more annoying to access right if i put
it at the top of your pantry way in the
back
chances are your intake is going to drop
substantially because you're not going
to be bothered
to go that extra effort we call this
designing for laziness and i like to say
humans are lazy by default
and how can we use that to our advantage
another example um this and this is
called a choice
architecture intervention let's say
you're at work on your desk there's a
clear bowl of i don't know m ms or
skittles or something
and within arm's reach right so it's
visible it's close
it's very easy to access but if you were
to
let's say put the candy in an opaque
container or put a lid on it
or move it farther away so i have to
stand up and walk over
or simply put it in a drawer out of
sight my intake will drastically go
down again without my really
conscientiously realizing that it's
happening
and many of the points so he made were
supported on my next call with dr lane
norton
who also has a competitive background
but has focused more of his published
work lately
toward understanding why well over half
of diets fail
and what we can do to help people keep
the weight off once they've lost it
there's no one diet that pops out as hey
the mediterranean diet was best or hey
low carb was best or hey plant-based was
best
because if you equate them for calories
then all the diets do about the same
and a lot of that is that dietary
adherence is pretty terrible across the
board
no matter how you slice it the relapse
statistics are still pretty bad
the more people regain it than keep it
off
but despite the fact that weight
maintenance is a challenge for many
people
lane has identified the five most common
weight maintenance strategies
used by people who were successful with
long-term weight loss
what we do see is these habits and
behaviors and
the first one and the most common one is
that
these people practice some form of
cognitive restraint so that can be in
the form of
calorie counting it can be in the form
of i'm not eating past a certain hour or
i'm not eating before a certain hour so
time restricted eating
points like with weight watchers or carb
restriction or fat restriction there's
there's
any number of ways that you can restrict
your dietary intake another one that may
be a little bit surprising to people is
people who lose weight keep it off tend
to self-monitor quite regularly meaning
they weigh themselves pretty often
i don't want to become dogmatic about
that point i'm not saying you can't lose
weight and keep it off if you're not
weighing yourself regularly but what
that does do
is it provides feedback and i'm not
talking about like a day-to-day
fluctuation because people get too
wrapped up in that
but if over the course of weeks and
months
you see that scale going up then you can
correct for that
and then a third point is not surprising
which is regular exercise
probably the major reason is there's
good evidence that exercise
sensitizes you to satiety signals and
then some
smaller points that bubble up as well as
people tend to use structured programs
when they have success
at kind of the highest level you know
it's like hiring a nutrition coach or a
dietitian
but even like people people make fun of
things like weight watchers or jenny
craig or a nutrisystem or whatever but
those people
on average do perform better because
just kind of
winging it with no plan doesn't usually
work out very well
and then something i thought was
interesting in a recent study they found
that the strongest characteristic in
this particular study that was
associated with weight loss maintenance
was what's called
low recency basically do you value
long-term
data more than short-term data a very
easy example of that would be
well i really want to eat this donut
right now because i know it'll make me
feel good
but if that doesn't fit you know your
daily caloric requirement
okay do i value feeling good right now
more than i value wanting to get to my
goal so those people with low recency
would choose the long-term goal
over the short term feeling lane also
explained that even though it will
require some restraint
you should be able to maintain your
weight loss by eating more calories than
you were eating
while losing the weight so once you
reach your goal weight you can start to
increase your calories to a higher
intake
and gradually if you build the habits
and behaviors we've been outlining
it should start to feel less and less
restrictive over time
for me i struggled with dietary
adherence when i first got into
bodybuilding
until i switched to a more flexible
dieting approach
and just the fact that i knew i could
eat what i wanted so long as it fit my
macros
i had no problems with adherence after
that it feels easy
i continue to do it to this day it
doesn't give me hardly any stress but
there are some people
for them tracking macros is extremely
stressful you know
i've heard from some people who say you
know i tried tracking macros
i hated it i did low carb and that feels
easy to me
and so what i would say to people is
find the method of restriction
that feels the least restrictive for you
as an individual
but also don't assume that what feels
easy for you will also feel easy for
somebody else because i've also made
that mistake as well
and last but not least i wanted to have
an expert on supplements set the record
straight about fat burners
dr eric trexler has published a whole
lot of papers on a variety of different
supplements
including caffeine creatine omega-3s and
plenty more
and in our chat he outlined the
different types of fat burners that look
good in theory
and whether or not any of them are
actually worth using you know there are
plenty of types of supplements out there
that are marketed for fat loss so
supplements that are supposed to enhance
fat oxidation things like carnitine and
cla
stuff that does in fact increase energy
expenditure
caffeine capsaicin ephedrine yohimbine
stuff like that
you'll also see things that are marketed
as kind of hunger reducers so
most anything that's marketed as a
thermogenic will also
typically impact hunger but then you've
got other stuff like ginger and 5 htp
and then there's also stuff that's
marketed as kind of nutrient blockers so
things that
modify or block the absorption of fat or
carbohydrate
and so all of those on paper sound great
but the problem is they all have some
kind of flaw
for things like caffeine you worry about
if i try to use this consistently will i
habituate to it there are some
on that list that just have quality
control issues like yohimbine
some have side effects like yohimbine
and ephedrine and there there of course
are some nutrient blockers that work too
well and cause
really uh unfavorable gi distress
and then for most of them the issue is
that there's just a lack of
really strong conclusive evidence and
most of the ones that have been really
well studied you'll find that
you could achieve what they do with much
easier more affordable methods
so let's let's put it all together now
like someone comes to you and they're
like i want to lose fat
what supplements do i take are there any
that you really would recommend to them
my recommendations would be the same for
whether they're doing a fat loss phase
or not
so i would still say like yeah there are
some supplements that can help you
during your fat loss phase that they
just don't cause fat loss right so
things like creatine monohydrate whey
protein if you're not getting enough
protein through your food because
high protein diets are fantastic for fat
loss goals when we're on a weight loss
diet sometimes it's hard we will
restrict fat
and it's hard to get essential fatty
acids into the diet and so fish oil
could be a really good a really good
option
there there might be some vitamins or
minerals that that we're getting less of
when we start reducing food intake so
it's another good reason why you might
consider taking a multivitamin
or even a vitamin d supplement as well
and before we wrap it up i do want to
direct you guys
to a few things that i think you'll find
helpful when it comes to your own fat
loss plan
first i've linked a few amazing
resources that my guests have to offer
down below whether it be a tracking app
an ebook or some other content i also
have an ebook called the ultimate guide
to body recomposition
which outlines exactly how to set up
your diet whether your main goal is to
lose fat
build muscle or do both equally at the
same time and i'd encourage you guys to
all go follow my guests on the
respective platforms they all put out
great science-based content so i'll have
all that linked down below as well so
don't forget to
leave the video a thumbs up if you guys
enjoyed it subscribe if you haven't
already and i'll see you guys all here
in the next one
