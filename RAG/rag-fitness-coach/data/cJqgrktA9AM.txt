hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and today's quick tip is
how to train
for your fiber type are you a fast
twitch are you slow twitch
are you a twitch that well no one really
wants and people walk back and forth
down the street and you look up at them
and they're like man get away from you
say
maybe you're that fiber type let's find
out so
is it worth it
first question
and only question
to try to train to your fiber type as of
middle of the year 2022 and our
knowledge of the literature access to
equipment that can tell us our fiber
type
maybe here are some problems with fiber
type specific training and by that i
mean like yeah man i'm fast which only
sets the fives from here and my biceps
are slow twitch so i'm just doing sets
of 20 30. maybe
but a few problems three specifically
problem number one
it is insanely difficult to figure out
what fraction of
faster and slower fiber types any one
specific muscle is in your body
forget about your whole body because
fiber types are often
quite muscle specific you may have a
higher proportion of slower twitch
fibers in your chest a higher proportion
of faster fibers in your biceps and so
on and so forth each muscle group in
your body has a significant variation
from your average in your body so even
knowing what average fiber type you are
over your whole body may not really help
you much with individual muscles because
you may be faster twitch on average
but your forearms are slower twitch
that helps in other regards huh
am i raising my eyebrows enough all
right but so you would assume that
faster fiber type training
works better for your forums and you
would just be like not having bigger
forums nothing's happening some at some
point you try super high reps and it
actually works much better and you're
like damn it i guess there's no such
thing as one fiber type for my whole
body so that's bullshit right away
secondly yes there are fiber ratios
in each muscle but here's another piece
of news
most muscles have a relatively even mix
of faster and slower twitch fibers so
when you ask like hey are your pecs fast
twitch or slow twitch the real actual
way to
ask that question is
is there a slight predominance of faster
twitch fibers in your pectoralis major
or a slight predominance of slower
twitch fibers and what does slight mean
is it 45 this is 60 40 is it 70 30
maybe there's a way to tell right
but there's not
anything other than getting your muscle
biopsied which by the way only tells you
in the biopsy site when they pull out a
chunk of muscle and they say oh this is
the fraction of fiber uh that's your
muscle fibers that are faster twitch and
slower switch and everything in between
because remember it's actually a
spectrum
uh we know that for this part of your
pecs that's the case but what about this
part
we're actually not really sure that that
holds and certainly it's going to be
relatively indicative but
maybe that's not indicative enough for
you to really design your specific
program
so what we can do is try to infer this
from training
they say okay you know
i'm going to train in a certain way
maybe for higher reps and for lower reps
assuming that lower up training is more
sort of representative of something that
taxes the faster fibers and there's some
truth to that
and then a higher reps are more
representative of something that taxes
the slower fish fibers and maybe there's
some truth to that and if my body
responds better than one of the other i
know which fiber type i am but hold on
there's tons of confounders there making
training estimates of fiber type really
just not that ideal here's an example
let's say
your legs in squat exercise respond well
to heavy loads sets of five to ten and
not so well just that's a 10 to 20 or 20
to 30. and you've tried this out now is
that because your quadriceps are faster
twitch and thus really prefer the
heavier loading lower reps
or is it because you're kind of out of
shape and it's not that you don't have
slower twitch fibers in your quads that
make sets of 10 not so stimulative it is
that you're so out of shape that
anything after eight reps is such a huge
fraction of cardiovascular demand versus
muscular demand and thus cardiovascular
limiting factor versus muscular limiting
factor
but the real reason you don't benefit
much from sets of 15 is that you gas out
before the muscle gets tired and there's
plenty of slower twitch fibers maybe
predominantly slower trick fibers but
they're still
smoking a cigarette waiting on for hold
on a second like your lungs just gave up
we didn't even have a chance to go close
to failure and thus a chance to grow so
a lot of times when people say oh you
know
i uh fast twitch dominant because my
body prefers lower reps versus high reps
is not very clear to most people in the
know that that really is something super
dependable
in addition people try to use bar speeds
people try to use failure approaches so
for example bar speeds if you move the
bar really fast
maybe you are faster twitch maybe but
bar velocity has something to do with
your fiber type it also has something to
do with the state of your nervous system
and the degree to which you are trained
and your limb ratios and leverages
that's a lot of layers and fiber type is
one important part of that layer but
it's like a five layer cake and fiber
type may only account for
20 to 40 percent of that can you really
discern fiber type from you know when
when your error rate is 60 to 80 percent
gee whiz you know you might not be
looking at what you think you're looking
at
what about failure proximity
some people will say with some validity
that faster twitch individuals or people
who have faster twitch muscles
when they approach failure it'll be
normal speed and the muscles get really
tired really fast very poor handling
fatigue which is true and they go up and
just back down so there's not a place
where you grind a lot and the shit slows
down on you at some point it just falls
on you
there's some validity to that but
there's also validity to the fact that a
lot of the way people fail is down to a
neurological causative explanation it's
the way your primary motor cortex works
it's the way your motor neurons are
assembled at the particular margins it's
the way that your motor neurons interact
with your muscles that may be the reason
why you why you fail really fast instead
of really slow yes your fiber type is a
component of that but again it may
explain 20 to 40 percent of the variance
which means you have a 60 to 80 percent
error rate and trying to infer fiber
type just from how fast you uh approach
failure so there's some validity to it
but just generally fucking not enough
for us to be like yep you're a fast
twitch deuce that's a five i wish we had
that level of insight from training but
we just don't
point number three our last problem with
trying to do fiber type training
is a real doozy there are actually a
number of studies now
and the average
insight from these studies on fiber type
in different types of training for
example examining
whether or not heavier training for
lower reps versus lighter training for
higher reps grows the faster slow fibers
differently
as much as i don't like to admit this
i wish we could elucidate more of this
sort of study design
generally speaking
there doesn't seem to be much of a
dependable difference there may be a
dependable difference but it may be very
very small what i'm saying is this
when we subject
uh you have muscles with both faster and
slower fiber types to
lower reps both the faster and slower
types seem to grow relatively similarly
to higher reps and vice versa right
now some people grow better from higher
ups than lower reps but if you zoom in
on some of those people their faster
fibers also respond really well to
higher reps as well as lower reps
not completely but so much so that it
might
sort of
obscure the effect of fiber type
specific responses altogether
assuming they exist at all we think they
exist but they might not
the reality might be
your faster fibers
respond really well hypertrophy wise
from anything between roughly sets of
five to sets of 30.
taken close to failure any sets like
that all the way from pretty fucking
heavy all the way to pretty fucking
light
and it might be that your slower twitch
fibers exactly or very similarly
responsive to that except less
right
it's like uh oh this is rough
taking a look at height and basketball
ability
right you get someone who's six foot
seven and you're like hey you're really
good at basketball and you're someone
who's four foot seven you look down at
them and they're like am i good at a
different kind of basketball like yes
gymnastics
uh
you might just suck
proportionally more at basketball
ability
what are slower fibers really good at
endurance work we know that but they
don't hypertrophy much from endurance
work
their internal structure changes they
grow a ton of mitochondria and they
actually sometimes lose myofibrils so
that they can't produce as much force
per cross-sectional area as they used to
but they can produce a lower amount of
force over and over and over and over so
we have to remember that the fiber types
were not even designed by evolution to
do like one for higher reps one for
lower ups all sets of five to thirty
that really is actually
faster fibers are just better at all
then
slower fibers really especially very
slow twitch fibers
their best not even at growing muscle
they don't grow much when they respond
to heavy training they're best at
endurance adaptations which faster
fibers are not good at
so this whole idea that like a set of 30
is growing pure slow twitch a set of
five is growing pure fast twitch and
somewhere between 15 and 20 is both
that's probably bullshit a set of five
all the way to a set of 30 probably
really grows your fast switch fibers
pretty well and as the faster twitch
fibers are analyzed and then we analyze
the slightly slower switch fibers and
the intermediate twitch fibers and the
slower twitch and then all the way to
the slow twitch their growth response
from sets of five to six of 30 is lower
lower lower and lower on average
so the whole idea of fiber type specific
training we might already have sets of 5
to 30 might already be pretty fucking
specific to faster fibers and a growth
program specific to slower twitch fibers
just might not exist
like a type of basketball specific to
people at four foot seven
eh if it's basketball people who are six
foot seven are just fucking better at it
right
being six foot eight i can say these
things with quite a bit of confidence
so okay fuck
looks like maybe fiber type specific
training doesn't work and that's
probably my general opinion on the
matter
are we just supposed to just train and
forget about how things are responding
and not try to alter our training to our
demands no no no we are supposed to do
that but it's a better idea to just go
by the stimulus proxies and what the
fuck are those well
in any given rep range sets of 5 to 10
10 to 20 or 20 to 30.
try all three of those up ranges for a
given exercise for a given muscle and
see which one of those rep ranges gives
you more of the following
a perception of an insane amount of
tension
in the muscle or at higher reps a
perception of burn in the muscle
some muscles you do sets of like five or
six and they just feel like they're
fucking peeling out
some muscles you do sets of five or six
and you're like
i don't know i just feel inconvenienced
some muscles with sets of 25 to 30
the burn in the muscle is the deepest
most painful thing you've ever felt and
you're like holy fuck and someone's like
is that training your forearms you're
like i fucking sure hope so my forms are
blowing up with other muscles you do a
set of 25 to 30 and people are like what
do you think huge burn like i'm just
tired i just would like to not do this
anymore
right not a really great sign
tension and burn
pump you do a set of five you get a
massive pump you're probably on the
right track you do a set of 30 for
another muscle you get a massive pump
you're not probably the right track you
do a set of five and a set of 30 and
both give you great pumps shit so it
sounds like you got no wrong answers
which absolutely can happen
then it's disruption you do a bunch of
sets of 30 or 25 or whatever
you go home you wake up the next day
someone's like your quads fucked up
you're like nah i don't know man they
just feel flat and depleted and tired
they didn't get sore or nothing
on the other hand you might go back and
do sets of eight for the quads and the
next day you can't get out of bed and
you're super crazy dom's something
fucking happened
so if you train your muscles experiment
with all the different rep ranges and
find which combination because it
doesn't have to be one right answer of
rep ranges
really gets that muscle a ton of tension
or a ton of burn
gets that muscle a ton of pump for how
many sets you have to do and a crazy
amount of disruption which means fatigue
and strength drop-off and soreness
whatever gets you the most of that is a
proxy for how much stimulus you're
getting for muscle growth
that's probably something good to go on
so when you say oh i do lots of sets of
fives for my packs
people be like oh yeah fast twitch your
correct answer is like maybe
maybe in part that's part of it but all
i know is that's a five for my packs
fuck me in the
ass
and that's a 25 i just feel annoying and
tiring
and if that's the case
that's how i would structure my training
much more into which fiber type now
here's the thing
if there's a lot of correct answers
you're like sets of five fuck up my
quads sets the 15 fuck up my quads
that's a 25 fuck out my quads then great
all these things work you can just vary
them for a few months do sense of five
to ten for a few minutes after switch
exercises do sets of 10 to 20 for you
know a month or two after do psycho sets
of 20 to 30 you're going to get growth
all the time your joints aren't going to
be you know sort of uh
aggravated in the same way and you have
time to back off the load and do high
reps and stuff like that that variation
keeps things fresh and keeps you going
for a long time so you the point of this
isn't to discover the one fucking rep
range oh that's a 12 for me my pecs are
set to 12. but i sub sets of 11. that's
not the right answer
range is an effect that could be the
entire thing from 5 to 30 or it could be
like a normal distribution where it's
like oh you know so 17 15 and 20 is
great for you know my my back but after
you know anything much higher anything
much lower is not great you can even do
my bimodal distribution where you're
like oh you know for my quads that's a
five to ten are really good it also sets
up 25 to 30 are really good but i think
that's 15 to 20. i don't know
something's off my stimulus proxies pump
burn etc they're just not as good and
that's totally valid
follow your body signs
and
do
what seems to work best and especially
if you compare this with long-term
results like i got crazy pumps crazy
tension crazy burn i did that for three
months doing these rep ranges and my
quads fucking grew and i got a ton
stronger hey list fiber type or not
fiber types be damned you're doing the
right thing that is my best advice to
you please comment your fiber type in
the comments below i'll see you guys
next time
