hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
building your first program video number
two
choosing your weights and reps video
number one is a must-watch for folks
following the series we're going to have
like five videos in the series
to take you through all of the basics of
building your first
and thus beginner program now it can be
a program for yourself
or it can be a program you're building
for somebody else but they pretty much
have to be beginner
they're new to the weightlifting process
here we go
we're going to cover a couple things
we're going to talk about why the 5 to
10 rep range is a very good range for
beginners to train at at first
we're going to talk about what we mean
by challenging sets
because just doing a set doesn't mean
it's very stimulative if it's too easy
we're going to talk about how to warm up
to challenging weights because there's a
big difference in many of you who have
designed beginner programs before know
from telling a person hey i want you to
lift for a challenging set of five to
ten reps
and then actually knowing what weight to
put on the bar to do that so you have to
warm up to it and warming up is of
course critical for injury prevention
and so on and so forth
then we're going to talk about making
sure you're judging difficulty
accurately because
heart set is you know tough to define
for some people and then of course we'll
get a nice wrap up of the two long
didn't read version so here we go the 5
to 10 rep range is the rep range we
recommend
for beginner training for the first at
least several months of training and
a lack of diversity of other ranges why
well beginners have two considerations
for rep range first of all
they want to be able to train heavy
enough
to cause good size and strength gains
and also enough repetitions because
volume is a factor
in hypertrophy and in strength
adaptation and if you just do like one
rep at a time it might not be enough
stuff so heavy enough enough reps
but not so heavy and not so many reps
that your technique degrades and thus
your technique is bad which can increase
the chances of injury decrease the
actual stimulus to the muscle involved
and teach and reinforce that poor
technique so that if you want to do
better later
you actually have a hard time because
you have to unlearn crappy habits
so sets of five to ten reps challenging
sets we'll get to what that means in a
bit
check the boxes here pretty well because
it's enough loading it's enough weight
on the bar
to cause lots of size and strength gains
it's also enough repetitions per set
five to ten to drive that high load
stimulus home
and really get a good degree of uh
actual progress
but it's not so many reps or so much
load
that it causes lots of fatigue and lots
of technical breakdown so it's a great
great middle of the road rep range now
does that mean exactly five to ten can
you do some sets of four or some sets of
11 every now and again totally but
roughly and that
is a real good place to start beginners
that's why we recommend beginner
start on that range now every working
set
should be in that range maybe not
necessarily a warm-up set
some of the warm-up sets can be but what
exactly is a working set
when we say a working set is a set that
is challenging what exactly does that
mean
well here's the challenging set concept
we can do
sets of five to ten reps but what if we
do them with like a coca-cola can again
unless you're preposterously weak
which my condolences to you if that's
the case i guess you're not
dead not condolences although if you're
that weak you're approximately dead
anyway
so if you're just only doing sets of
five to ten with a coke can or something
like that
uh are you going to get great size and
strength that way you may think well yes
but you said
that's a five to ten but ah it's not
challenging enough and it's not
challenging enough
so unchallenging in fact that you won't
get your best results so that's a
problem the sets need to be challenging
which means what exactly luckily it's
not that complicated
the load has to feel heavy through the
first set so if you do your first rep in
a set of
challenging five to ten and you're like
wee that was easy
that's probably not that great but if
you do your first rep and it's like oh
snap
all right all right this weight is
pushing back on me then that's a good
first sign that the set is actually
going to be challenging
next if you pushed yourself
to the limit right and got as many reps
as possible
you would do no more than about five
reps extra of what you thought you could
do
until you simply couldn't do any more
reps so if i gave you a challenging set
of 10 reps if you stop at
rep number 10 and rack the weight you
turn to me and i ask you hey like
how many more reps could you have gotten
until you just totally couldn't have
gotten any more reps
your answer had better not be anything
more than 15. if you were like i think
it had like another three like 13 reps
but then i would have just been pooped
out because even at 10 it was getting
real tough
that's a good answer that means it's a
challenging set if i say to you after
you've done a set of 10 reps and you
claim it was a challenging set like
how many reps you think you really could
have done uh extra
you could say well you know like really
gun to the head
yeah like max effort i don't know like
20 25 30.
it was really just not that hard not a
challenging set and if
you don't know if someone you're
training or yourself if you don't know
if it's challenging
put more weight on the bar because it
probably isn't
when something is challenging you're
pretty good about knowing about it like
you do a set of
eight and someone's like how many more
do you think you're gonna have you're
like i don't know man
not that many that's a good answer then
it's pretty challenging then you're good
to go then you're getting some really
good stimulus
and you don't have to go all the way and
test these things
you know if you stop at 10 you don't
have to like keep going and say okay
i hit 15 and that was all i could do
that means that weight is good i can use
it for future sets future workouts you
don't have to do that
there's a shortcut the repetitions
towards the end of a set have to feel
much harder than the ones at the
beginning and then you know
you're in a challenging zone often this
comes with a few other things so not
only do the reps have to feel harder
which means
like rep number four could be like all
right that's pretty heavy rep number
eight has got to be like
whoa this is not rep number four things
are going like this i'm getting real
tired and it's harder to push
this weight that means impending failure
is approaching that means you're close
enough to that failure
to actually get a really good challenge
that usually comes with a couple of
other things not always but usually
comes with a burn that can be felt on
the muscle right so if you're if you're
curling you know rep number nine in a
bicep and your biceps like on fire
yeah you're probably getting a good
stimulus especially if you're just a
beginner
you're doing a really great job and
you can actually muscle itself can feel
like the level of internal tension is
higher you're like dude my biceps are
really working on these last couple reps
like the weight maybe doesn't
necessarily feel heavier but your
muscles feel like they're really really
trying
right if none of that happens you're
training too light
uh and you just gotta go heavier if some
of that stuff is happening
then you're pretty good and you can
always increase the load of reps later
right so if your set starts to feel like
that within the 5 to 10 rep range
that is the load feels pretty heavy with
you know like a like a real load every
single rep the later reps start to feel
really hard
the muscle starts to feel like it's
producing a lot of tension and
potentially
there's also a burn in the target muscle
then you know
you're probably you're probably doing
something right and you're probably a
sensor challenging
you're checking all those boxes and
you're good to go
now the next question is okay so we know
what a challenging set
feels like how do we pick a weight
to get us into that because you could
pick a weight initially and be like
alright this is going to be a
challenging set and then 12 reps later
you're like
just kidding i guess i fuck that up
that's rep number 17 now
better just rack it which is a good idea
better just rack it so how do you know
if a load is going to be challenging
because you're just
picking a weight randomly out of a hat
may not get you there or you could just
pick way too
heavy a weight where you're like all
right five to ten and you do the first
two like this like
you're not making it to ten okay so you
can air how do you fix that how do you
actually choose a load of the
appropriate weight so
the first thing you do when you start an
exercise any exercise is of course a
warm-up
set at least one set okay that does a
couple of really cool things for us
it can let us sharpen up our technique
it can warm up the physical structures
to make
the uh entire endeavor safer and more
effective because as you warm up
your muscles and nervous system sort of
wake up and can produce more force it
can actually give you
more out of the entire enterprise give
you more stimulus later so these are all
really good things
how do you pick your first warm-up
weight well it's got to be a weight
that's incredibly light it has to feel
light and the good news is
you don't have to estimate anything here
you physically just pick up the bar or
the dumbbell or the machine
and it has to be light okay this isn't
like a super complex topic although many
of us nerds myself included tend to
overthink this
check this out if you unrack a bar let's
just say the unloaded bar on the bench
press
and it feels like this it's light if you
like someone asked you like how many
reps can you do like i don't know a lot
okay then it's light if it physically
feels light in your hands you're good to
go
if it feels heavy it's too much go to a
lower weight that's lighter
okay that actually feels like it's not
challenging technically speaking you
should be able to do 10 or more reps
no problem which means your failure
point is 15 or more reps 20 30 something
like that
what you do is you take that weight out
for a ride and you do a set of like five
to ten reps
this is a warm-up set with very perfect
technique as good of a technique as you
can do and really pay attention to the
technique it allows you to reinforce
technique and also prepares you for the
hard heavy sets
ahead after you do that you're starting
to get a little warmed up
rest for one or two minutes put more
weight
on the bar a weight you think will be
significantly harder
but that would still be doable in the 5
to 10 rep range
so air a little bit on the easier side
but this next set should be pretty hard
potentially if you're a good guesser
especially as a beginner this next set
can be
your actual working set because if you
picked a challenging weight it is in
fact challenging
uh check that is a working potentially
though
you can undershoot it and let's say you
started with a bar
you did 10 easy and you're like okay
great that was easy
then you go to 65 pounds 10's on the
side
and you're like okay this might be
challenging and you get to 10 reps
and you're like i can do another 15 of
these that was stupid
iraq then you take another guess maybe
you go to 85 another 10
and then you get to a set of you know
seven or eight and it starts to get
really really really hard
then you can rack the weight and that
was a successful challenging set
right so if you overshoot
you can always decrease so you might be
like ooh 65 was easy
i'm going to do 105. kind of in
retrospect a bit ridiculous
you put 105 on there and it you do get
like you know two or five reps and it's
tough don't don't go to failure don't
get to
five or six you do on the third it's
just to really slow down on you
then just rack oops you overshot but now
because you know like the bottom end you
know it's heavier than 65
that your working weight's gonna be at
your heart set of five to ten
because you already tried 65 is way too
light and then you know 105 is way too
heavy
so g you know just split the difference
and that's probably a really good guess
right there
so at some point during this process
maybe it's on the second set
maybe it's on the third fourth or fifth
set if you have some trouble estimating
or just need more time to warm up
you'll do your first set of five to ten
that's actually challenging
okay and challenging means the weight
really really starts to slow down
and it's tough to keep up a really
really good technique if that's the case
and we'll get into
exactly what that means in just a sec as
soon as you do your first challenging
set
you stop right there you write down how
much weight it was
you write down how many reps you got and
you move on to the next exercise because
in week one of this program this is for
week one
we're gonna do only one set of every
single exercise we chose that's it
it's that simple so how do you channel
so we said like you know a difficult set
you stop
if your technique is good uh it's not
good anymore what do we really mean by
that well
what challenging means is it feels
really heavy and close to my limits
with good technique okay you can always
slip up on technique and grind up more
reps in most cases
but that means you're doing a really bad
job and enhancing your injury risk and
actually getting not much more stimulus
and it's all really really bad news it's
nothing you want to do
so if you did rep number seven and it
was clean but very challenging
and you do rep number eight and it's
like you still get it
stop the set and the number you write
down that you successfully completed was
seven you don't write eight
because eight was dog shit it was
garbage right
great technique we'll keep training
effective we'll keep training safe
and there's no way out of it if you slip
up on technique
stop the set right there and write down
the number
of reps that you did that was with good
technique which should
worst be one rep away okay that's it
that's week one
stuff really really straightforward
really really simple so
feel free to pause the video just after
i give this a little rant this
uh slide here it's uh number four there
it's an example of choosing weight and
reps in the exercises that we came up
with last time in the last video
and it's just a sample of what that
might look like and you'll notice that
the sets and
reps or sorry the uh the reps and load
is kind of all over the map but this is
a sample
uh program of what somebody might
actually do right and how do we get
those exact numbers right how do we get
seven reps it says
monday the uh you know first workout
there
is a squat of 95 pounds that's the
working weight it doesn't show the
warm-ups which of course did by that
other formula
it says 95 pounds for seven reps why is
it seven
did we target seven no we maybe did 45
then we did 75 and then we did 95
and after we got to rep number seven
it was really hard and we thought to
ourselves uh
technique on this next rep might not be
good and then we racked or
we were like let's go and rep number
eight was like
sorry this is a bench example you get
the idea bench squat whatever like we're
squatting and it's like all shaky and
maybe we even cut the depth a little bit
we don't call ramp number eight we just
count number seven and we move on
it's that simple right that simple so
in summary what we're doing here is this
we want to warm up and build up slowly
and wait over a few sets to really find
our challenging set
to find the weight at which we are
challenged in the five to ten rep bridge
when you do a set and you're not yet to
10 reps
but the weight starts to feel much
harder to lift
your first rep where you really grind
stop
if you really think you can do another
one and still have a success for up with
good technique you can try it
but don't count it if it's bad technique
you don't want to get in that practice
and you're chasing your tail for a
really long time
write down your reps that you got with
the weight that you got for that
exercise
move on to the next exercise and warm up
for that next one repeat repeat repeat
repeat
so at the end of that first session you
should have done
plenty of warm-ups in one challenging
set of five to ten reps
they got really tough for every single
exercise just one set
and these numbers that we have which is
an example of the slide i just showed
you are critical because
they're going to form the foundation of
what we do in week two the week two
numbers form the foundation of what
we're gonna do in week three and so on
and so forth
and that element is called progression
not just what you do in week one but we
do two three four five six etcetera
and we're going to talk about that in
the next video where i will see
you
