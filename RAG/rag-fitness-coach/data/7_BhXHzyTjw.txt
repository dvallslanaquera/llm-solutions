seriously re-say what you're saying
because I agree I have more to add
I don't talk to the cameraman bro
what are you doing we're here to make
videos
to make videos we are making videos
Jared fuck
I said enough
I'm gonna let my actions speak loud
[Music]
hey folks
hey folks hey folks hey YouTube Hey Tech
talk
um
what's up only fans yeah and we got some
only fans people on us so listen we're
doing legs
and we're kind of doing our own thing
because we all have very independent
personalities
so
I'm continuing my motorcycle I'll be
doing pendulum squats and then Smith
machine good mornings
Jared will be doing Smith machine squats
and leg presses and leg curls
and then Charlie is going to be doing
some Smith machine squats and leg curls
and we'll be trying to give you some
technique tidbits along the way and a
little insight in how real training
works
and legs
all pretty quiet because legs
is on the Mind instead of whites
yes we're doing this first because it
warms my knees up
I feel a lot better for squats
and quad work after this
and when you get about two sets in three
sets into this movement
you kind of just feel a lot better like
as far as psychological arousal goes you
notice you start Smith squats or
squatting or any quad pattern first you
might have some weird knee stuff even
after a nice warm-up it still kind of
feels weird but two sets into this and
I'm basically ready to go for the rest
of the session
what Jared said and I think he might
have said this
but
um a cool thing about doing something a
not so difficult to exercise that's not
systemically fatiguing first
especially for something like lags which
requires a ton
of systemic arousal
it can be a little weird to like just
hit the heavy shit first
there's like half awake and you're like
wow really am I really into this
but if you get an easier exercise first
by the time you're done with that you're
like juices are flowing you're good to
go and then you can hit that hardship it
actually works pretty well
[Music]
um
how'd that feel Jared painful
good very fucking painful so this leg
pry that curl is very good but the peak
contraction being lighter than the
bottom yes but if you put the some of
these things on it it's even better it
feels like shit you don't like that no
no this thing's already slanted
that's literally what you're doing I
don't understand what you mean by
slamming this pad is slanted okay the
more the reason this is the worse it is
Mike you're you're still scientist your
hips are off of this right yeah what we
want to do is put our legs if they're
here they enter here if they're up here
goes up here that doesn't matter it's
the pad starts here when you go and then
when you go all the way down you can get
a deeper stretch in your hands no my I
literally get the full stretch
I'm just better at keeping my hips
forward then you're gonna shut the fuck
up what does that even mean I'm on the
ground right now your hips are put it on
the machine what hey Charlie put that
thing on there to get a really good
stretch
yeah it's it's falling the exact same
way I just put it right there for you oh
it's so heavy
[Music]
yeah right there that's probably too
high though oh wait oh
sure it's up on your calves now
yeah it feels like shit like that
oh
just better
I'm here and I'm stretching my leg fully
so my knees are never even on this
watching everything so our hips are more
like this yes I mean we pre-struct our
hamstrings no that's literally what at
the bottom of your hips are like this
that means you're not pre-stretching
I watch it it feels way better not
convincing well it can feel better I
hear that and that's all perfect and
then this is like up in the middle of my
fucking calf I feel nothing here but you
can simply move on top you can move up
you can't I'm already on the top of this
like so like you can put your feet my
heels at the bottom or you can put them
here my heels at the bottom it's
literally right here why don't you just
do that it goes here what's good instead
of being here and then here well that's
good that it moves around because that
means at the top the fulcrum is smaller
and so that means you can hold it up if
you're on your calf like it's awkward as
fuck this is moving over my calf what's
this deciding to do that literally it's
you don't like awkward fuck sure yeah
but on principles this is a good idea
that's fine yeah yeah that's awesome
it's a good stretch at the bottom if you
can't get a full shot that's exclusively
why we do it that's the only reason why
I'm doing it
that's why I guess the stretch yeah his
hips are actually Over The Line
on the top of the pyramid yeah I do well
enough for that oh you're right that's
right yeah I do that and I actually
actually actively Flex my quads to make
room sure that buffer to stretch make it
this yep yeah stretch put some fall
permanent yeah we figured it out Jared
yeah
yeah that's why I said forward
I just there's no forward for me my legs
are short as crystals I'm as forward as
it gets when my hips are right here
[Applause]
oh
yeah good stuff Charlie let's go
foreign
a lot of people have suffered greatly on
this machine
Trevor Fulbright was here
he wasn't able to get out of the machine
after each set he would just kind of
slink in it for a while and then he
would fall out
yeah I thought so that was cool filming
yeah him and Izzy just went completely
nuts
let's go Mike
oh yeah these look great
come on yeah
foreign
so we just did a first working set
here
the exercise
we're doing
I'm doing
is the pendulum squat
I think
Jerry is this a pendulum squat or a
lever squat
was Arsenal called I call it pendulum I
think it is pendulum
in any case the same fucking machine
it's nice
the pendulum Squad
has a few upsides and a few downsides
the downside
was that
it applies the least Force at the bottom
that's the opposite of what you want to
try hypertrophy
the upside
is that
it seems to load the eccentric
especially starting from the top
to the bottom quarter like crazy
it really helps me slow my eccentrics
down on all the other exercises
because all of my other leg movements
hit the bottom the hardest
this is a little bit of interesting
variation
I've been using it for a few months
and it works quite well ideally
I wouldn't want to leverage so much
to the top and
I'm at the bottom
but it works pretty well
gives me a great four range of motion
so
not bait
not bait Arsenal
oh banana yeah
oh no
I've been to church
I know how to say no to Satan
is he joking
come on
[Music]
one
shit oh next year
noise
tough but good
just like my mother's love for me oh
did your mom ever give you tough love I
got my ass kicked I posted these on
Instagram once and this guy's like
because you know my cock's hanging
through
this guy's like I can see your cock I
just didn't know what to respond to that
right on like you look for dicks
actively in lifting videos
I can see your dick through your clothes
man
do you want my number
[Music]
[Music]
two more
[Music]
oh yeah
oh
don't look right
Charlie looks his legs look like he's
five foot two
that's proper proportions for a really
jacked guy five two for his legs and
then you're like oh you're five eleven
huh
I did that but
no pressure my belt completely came
loose no way yeah I saw that
I was like ah do I restart
I felt okay what fuck okay
thanks Charlie
oh good audio
at least I'm not vomiting
[Music]
[Music]
let's go Jared come on
nice
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
these fun easiest rack ever just go I
love it
so just to clear something out folks I
hate Mike Israel people I think that's
even pretty clear
um people always tell us like hey you
guys Crocs you really love Crocs you
like to wear them
um and the reality is we only like to
wear Crocs for one specific reason too
one they're cheap
number one and two they're just really
easy to put on and take off and they're
comfortable it's just three reasons
reason fours are quite durable so you
can just wear them for a while and
reason five is they're pretty ubiquitous
you can wear them indoors Outdoors for
many different activities fancy places
now consists love that hamsters love it
so Crocs are welcome everywhere but
here's why we don't like Crocs they're
aesthetic appeal
or because we they're just like industry
hoe Croc lovers or because they're a
really good lifting shoe and we found
that yeah look at that all the time yeah
look why are you lifting Crocs and I'm
like I don't and they're like I swear to
God I started lifting Crocs so like you
didn't and they're like well at one time
you're doing bench press I'm like well I
don't do bench rushing my feet you
stupid asshole but also let me clear
something up body folks fine folks great
ideas we love you all you guys send us
messages and tag us and posts that have
like Croc underwear and Croc bikini tops
a car that looks like a Croc shoe
it's not registering on the Richter
scale at all so on top of all that
bullshit
stop attacking me in your fucking Croc
potion they work hard
this is going to be good footage fuck
but but seriously guys charlie actually
knows fashion Jared and I are just
trying to put clothes on our body yeah
look at my fucking outfit because the
government says that we can't walk
around naked yeah
that's it so
two things one
of you good mornings
playing with the rack height I'm
actually going a little deeper than
usual
foot position slightly more behind get a
little bit more range of motion in the
hands maybe so I've lightened the weight
I've been doing like 275 I'm gonna go to
225 see how that works
little uh ROM for a load uh trade-off
we'll see if it plays in my favor
and uh you guys read comic books
remember adamantium you guys ever seen
duct tape made out of adamantium huh now
watch this you know adamantium is the
hardest substance on Earth
how can he do that fools simple human
chemistry
give this tips hi
up oh yeah
oh yeah
oh even better
yes
oh come on
oh shit
who's got better as you oh yeah
that was good
kept the hips higher
nope that's that last egg a couple
inches
thanks for those cues Charlie that
really helps
oh just two sets of eight here I'll fuck
me in the ass
what position is auto adjusted in a free
good morning your center of gravity
can't really change
uh
with this it sure as hell can
sure
stacked up Against the Machine so I
would say your feet a little bit behind
where you would think usually gives your
hamstrings more ROM and it doesn't
tighten you at the bottom
two sets of eight for me
that's my whole leg workout
[Music]
good I'm gonna keep my hips High stretch
them hamstrings
yes
yes
inside oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
[Music]
oh come on
up up
good
that's it
That's All She Wrote what do you got on
the leg press though well I have
two sets uh he's a heavier day
it's 10 to 15 reps the other day is my
lighter day do my reps so I'll do three
sets
Friday and then Friday
yeah probably three shots on Friday my
rep match the first set it'll be a
lighter leg press but today
it's gonna be heavy so I have my soft
music in so I don't kill myself
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
oh
come on
