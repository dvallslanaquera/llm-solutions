hey folks dr mike israel
renaissance periodization back again
nutrition myths video number four
dirty bulking oh boy
a lot of you folks have been asking for
this one
here we go no souls spared on this
battlefield
we're going to talk about the claim
itself what people actually mean when
they say dirty balkan we're going to
talk about why it's wrong
what good decent points it has because
it has some decent points
and to synthesize the wrong stuff and
the right stuff what are the best
practices
for actual bulking that may be just a
little bit dirty
uh christina aguilera circa 1999 dirty
you know you guys remember the song you
remember a little generation difference
but you guys know what i'm talking about
so anyway
here's the claim dirty bulking
essentially
is a hypothesis technically speaking
that's the only way to get huge
or the best way by far to get huge is to
do a couple of things one
eat way over maintenance like a thousand
calories or more over maintenance
a lot of that's going to be junk because
like you know it's dirty bulking for a
reason not just because you look
awful after but because you get to eat
dirty you get to eat a bunch of junk
food and that's
really the only way that it's tenable
because going a thousand calories over
surplus
over maintenance for most people is just
not a really fun experience
and if it's with clean food holy crap
but if it's with cookies and pizza and
doughnuts all of a sudden everyone can
bulk no problem at super crazy rates so
lots of junk is in
inclusion and what the results in is a
really fast weight gain
oftentimes in excess of two pounds a
week right and sometimes people will
message me and say hey i can't gain
weight and i'm like well
are you gaining weight in there yeah
like a pound a week i'm like oh my god
that's totally good and they think like
unless you're gaining a pound
pound and a half two pounds plus you're
not really gaining okay
and there's another idea here about like
macro counting and trying to have a
small
surplus and the idea behind dirty
bulking of those who promote it is that
like macro counting and cleaning
time for chumps like it's not gonna work
you gotta fucking drink a gallon of milk
and smash a ton of food and that's like
hardcore serious people that's how you
gain size
macro counting and clean eating is for
like
nerds that are super skinny and they
read too many bodybuilding magazines and
they're too like nerdy they're like
my background is just shut up and eat
brother okay
well it's wrong for at least three good
reasons and here they are
first of all if you do this dirty
bulking you'll get really fat
okay i did it and i got real fat
to the point where i have loose skin now
that's intractable it's to be with me
forever it's awful it looks like shit
i'm not terribly worried about it life
is life but
you know do you want that probably not
so maybe don't do it
everyone i know short of people with
incredibly stellar genetics and look if
you have stellar genes
you know what i'm saying great most of
us don't
and dirty bulking will make most of us
get fat and i know tons of people and i
used to program dirty bugs for people
and they all got fat
right so this is a real thing it's a
real thing this like what do they call
like the dreamer bulk
with the idea that you're going to just
get huge and stay lean
like short of like an unbelievable drug
cocktail which probably kill you anyway
and or unreal genetics which you could
be doing a better job with your genetics
anyway and staying super lean and
getting big
it's really just nothing that pans out
you get super fat you get loose skin
and then once you are fat uh even if you
sort of got away without loose skin
you gotta diet all that fat off and look
if you gain like
40 pounds in a few months and
seven and a half of that that's really
good of was muscle you have to diet off
33 and a half pounds of fat like uh
sorry 32 and a half good god math but
it's just like holy shit like
that's 30 pounds of fat you have to die
it off the hypocaloric
diet in order to do that in a rapid
fashion is insanely pressuring on muscle
growth and retention you can end up
losing two and a half pounds
of that muscle and then you're just
netting five after just doing whoosh
like this
and whoosh all the way down to
unbelievable amount of effort
for what right it's it's like a really
not so great use of resources right
number two and this is part of that
whoosh is it's not healthy it's
really really unhealthy especially if
you do it a lot it's a bad deal
if you ever get blood work done during a
dirty bulk your doctor's gonna be like
are you
trying to attempt suicide and not
telling anyone about it
is this just your way of cashing out
your good answer could be like yeah
actually yes
right but it's not nothing you want it's
really bad for your health and
bonus points you feel like crap like
why right why begs the question of why
and of course the claim is because this
is the only way to put on muscle we'll
get to that right
um you can feel so bad and get so fat
that you actually affect lift
performance especially compound lifts i
know people
including myself that on the top end of
a mass phase when they got really fat
dirty bulking
they couldn't even do high rep squats
and leg presses anymore they'd start
throwing up all the time or the backward
cramp
because they're literally so fat and
impedes their performance now here's the
deal man whatever you do in the gym be
it massing or cutting outside of
really extraneous circumstances like
last three weeks before a show or
something crazy
your performance should not be harmed i
mean think about it you're eating
in order to enhance your performance at
the gym so you can grow more muscle
if your eating starts to deteriorate
your performance at the gym
man you're just not thinking some shit
through right it's like a surgeon
takes like modafinil or some kind of
upper to be super precise and awake for
eight hours right okay
chuck barkley do it all the time like
what if you take so much of that stuff
or like amphetamines that you're like
doing surgery like that they're like no
trust me it's fine like no
what you're doing to help yourself is
hurting you now it doesn't make a whole
lot of sense now
all this would be like maybe worth the
trade-off if it was worth the muscle
gain if the muscle game is so much more
impressive
but the fact is is that at a roughly
300 800 daily calorie surplus which look
it's not starvation macros it's a
shitload of food
you can gain all the muscle you need
with a fraction of the fat versus dirty
bulking
dirty bulking has this sort of
asymptotic relationship
where bulking in general as your surplus
rises it's kind of an s-curve as you're
out of the tiny surplus it's barely
detectable like i eat 10 extra calories
a day you're not growing shit right
your muscle addition is really really
minimal possibly non-existent
as you get into that 100 200 300 400
calorie surplus range
your rate of gain starts to go up as you
get into the
six seven eight nine thousand calories
it starts to
to basically flatten out again so that
the difference in muscle that you gain
between 700 extra calories a day
and 1400 is going to be notable like
you will gain more muscle but you're
gonna get so much more fat
and you'll have to cut off your mass
gain phase early
because you got too fat to perform well
be healthy or just for the love of god
look remotely like a lifter
to where if you just stretched out the
phase that was gaining you 700
calories per day it was gaining maybe 90
of the muscle per week that that 1400
was gaining but you could do it for
one and a half times as long gain like
1.3
1.4 times the amount of muscle for that
phase
and never get a fraction of that fat
fraction of that unhealthy fraction of
performance
and the fat loss phase after is going to
be like
fucking six weeks and then you're back
to as lean as you ever wore and you can
repeat that
really awesome long road to real solid
gains
without an excessive amount of fat i'm
not saying fat is avoidable entirely
it's really not when you bulk you're
gonna get a little fatter
but there's a little bit fatter and
there's like what are we really gaining
here
right so you don't need to spend a long
time cutting your masses can now last
longer and here's the thing about longer
masses
once you have a bulk or a mass in place
you're getting good food you're getting
good training
there's a momentum there where you get
stronger and you figure out good
stimulus to fatigue ratio of where to
put your body for different exercises
and you start gaining momentum and
strength and volume in your training
and you really figure out your recovery
and all this takes weeks to open up
and then you're in the situation where
weeks after you started massing
at a reasonable rate you're on this
freight train of momentum like you got
your ship figured
and you're just getting bigger and
stronger bigger and stronger bigger and
stronger if you can take that mass phase
and stretch it out
by making the calorie surplus not this
extreme but this extreme
you get better results because you can
hack it over time
stupidest analogy i'll ever make of
think about going to a really awesome
party and having drinks
if you get like good and tipsy and then
have like a drink an
hour your ass is having a good time for
like eight hours until the party's no
longer fun and you jet the fuck out and
then
you can go to taco bell have a bunch of
food fall asleep not even have a
hangover
the uh the day after but if you do the
the dirty bulk approach to drinking
don't do this at home you have like 10
shots right away and
fucking black out and you miss the whole
party and someone's like it was the
party fun you're like i was there for
like i think an hour
psychologically i was there for like 45
minutes it was real fun and then it
wasn't
right so if you have a fun party stretch
it out if you have
a mass phase the momentum helps the
longer you stretch it out
to a point and that point is probably
between 300 800 calories for most people
of daily surplus
the better so there's a lot of wrong
here for the dirty bulking now
here's the thing there are grains of
truth to this a surplus is a very
powerful tool
so if you're thinking okay dirty bulking
stupid let me just gain tame gaintaning
is barely a thing once you're lean at
whatever body weight you are
you gain essentially almost no muscle so
if you are
20 body fat and you weigh 180 pounds
you can gain muscle and lose fat at the
same time not maximally efficiently
but reasonably until you're like 10 or
12 percent fat
at 180 pounds it's a crapload of muscle
gained over several years
and you have to know no bulking
whatsoever to do that as a matter of
fact if you want no cutting either right
however once you're at 10 to 12
especially for a natural athlete
you know you don't just lose fat and
gain muscle anymore what you're going to
do
get down to six percent body fat by
gaining muscle on the way
do you guys know what kind of diet it
takes to get to six percent body fat is
the kind that
robs your body of energy and raw
materials it doesn't give
it doesn't feed you that stuff so at
some point if you're 180 pounds and lean
there's no way to get more jacked at 18
lean you have to weigh 185 or 90 200
etc the only way to get to higher body
weights is by definition a surplus so a
surplus is a powerful tool so the dirty
bulkers
i think some of that response that
really promotes the dirty bulky movement
is to those book nerd macro people are
like and i don't want a big deficit
or big surplus i don't want to get too
fat like no for sure i hear you but did
you end up being like
135 and then 135 and a year later 135
and like i think i'm recomping like
fucking recomping what you're 135 pounds
you need to eat food to get big as soon
as you can see a semblance of abs or
relatively crisp abs
you got to start slowly gaining weight
and a lot of those people
that were those nerds that did the macro
counting and did the gaintaining
got you know salty on it as well as they
should because it didn't really work all
that well or really after a few months
just petered out
they had someone in the ear being like
dirty bulk and they tried it and
so they went from 135 to 160 for the
first time in their lives over the
course of like three or four months but
their lifts skyrocketed
and they got fucking big and then yeah
they cut sucked and they dyed it off
but then they kept a lot of the muscle
and they're like holy crap dirty bulking
worked now just because it works it
doesn't mean something
between those two extremes can't work
better and it really does but i see
where people are coming from surplus is
a powerful tool you never want to throw
it away
and here's the thing some junk is
totally okay as long as your weekly gain
rate
isn't good standing it's like you know
between 300 and 800 excess calories on
average per day
they can some days that could be no
excess some days a slight deficit some
days it's a little bit
higher 1500 you know you got a taco bell
i keep bringing up taco bell can you
guys tell them dieted down
um and as long as the average is pretty
good
you can have a bit of junk it's no
problem at all and
interestingly enough occasional junk
with mostly healthy foods
tastes really good and you really enjoy
the shit out of those cheat meals versus
if you have junk all the time
like when a chocolate chip cookie
doesn't make you happy anymore you're in
a really bad way
so this way if eat mostly healthy foods
a little bit of junk goes
even further of a way it makes you super
happy it's awesome you get the benefits
of a
surplus but it's not too big it's really
all all the check marks there at the
same time
now if you're in a position where like
look i don't want a dirty bulk but i
don't have an appetite for clean food
like i can't eat a surplus of clean food
i have a physical job i have a fast
metabolism i'm not a hungry person to
begin with just like people just aren't
big eaters so i gotta smash
brownies or i just won't get in the
calories maybe what you should do first
is try to make
your clean food one with a good macros
and stuff and healthy
tastes a bit better with out or minimal
macro alterations you can flavor it
better you can creatively cook it better
air fried french fries for example can
sometimes be like almost no fat but
they're
pretty fucking good okay they're not
like real french fries i'm not gonna lie
to you but damn they're pretty close and
way better than like bland white rice
that you poke at and just throw away the
spoon
so you can do a lot with flavoring and
stuff like that
before you switch to only cookies and
once you've
increased your food amount by eating
tastier clean
healthy food you can of course layer in
some junk on top of that
what you're saying is don't replace all
or most of your healthy food with only
junk that's the true dirty bulk don't do
that because it has all those downsides
so all this together what are the best
practices we can take away from this
well at least four tips
first eat mostly healthy which means
lean meats veggies fruits whole grains
and healthy fats that should be the core
of your diet
in addition to that take that core and
make it taste pretty good you can put
some seasoned salt on that broccoli
don't just eat it plain you're not in
this to suffer and if you are you know
saying nichi kind of stuff do you do you
but most of you guys are trying to enjoy
this and get all the results the thing
is if you flavor your food
unless you're a bodybuilder that's three
weeks outside a contest needs to manage
sodium it's really just not a thing
right so it's all the benefits not on
the serp
none of the costs whatsoever in addition
to that point number three you can
absolutely
put in some fun junk on occasion and
that's great it's part of living life
you know you eat
super clean most of the week and then
friday night you head to the all you can
eat sushi buffet and just
nuke shit it's awesome but like if you
do that daily
and that's the only way you get your
excess calories yeah you're gonna get
fat and sloppy and slow but if you do
that once or twice a week maybe even
three times
then you're totally good to go and it's
no problem at all at the end of the day
patience and consistency are the rules
of of the day
there is no way to rush the gains on
that doesn't come with a huge price
you can rush on muscle gain by dirty
bulking it will occur faster but it'll
occur
in such an unhealthy manner such an
unsustainable manner of such an excess
fat that permanently
fucks you up manner it's going to be
regrettable right
you i don't want you guys to regret the
same shit i'm currently regretting
i'm not really regretting it anymore but
some shit happened that i wish just
didn't happen
right it's like uh you know captain of
the titanic's like icebergs are real
i'm just here to tell you guys that
they're like nonsense i don't believe
you it's like look
i've been burned like this right so yeah
dirty bulking has its promises but
here's the deal
do it slightly dirty mostly clean
stretch it out longer
with a moderate surplus i'm not saying
no surplus i'm not saying a teeny tiny
one
just not a mega one 300 800 excess
calories per day depending on how big
you are
certain other factors train hard train
consistently train progressively
deal it when you need to string together
like i don't know four to six
months of bulking like that you are
going to be enormous
way bigger in the now you're going to be
still in good shape still in good health
you won't be super fat
a short mini cut later you're back to
square one with body fat except carrying
a crap load of muscle
rinse repeat get enormous fight the
military win take over the world folks
there's your template go out and do it
you
