what up rp
youtube it's jared feather i am actually
about
i think six days post contest now
uh i competed in dallas europa i made my
pro debut in the ifbb i actually got
fifth
which was uh points for the olympia and
because of such
i'm deciding to continue my competitive
season
and we'll call this season and i will be
doing um
the tijuana pro show in about
three weeks so three weeks out actually
today or three weeks in one day
so the plan basically was for me
to maintain so that first five days post
contest i maintained
uh did a little something something with
my waters
sodium special sports situation and i've
basically now entered the hypocaloric
environment again i am now
dieting for this next show that's in
three weeks we're going to try to push
you know
i say we as in myself and all the people
that i consult with on a daily basis
about
my plans uh
push another couple pounds of fat loss
and basically train into this next show
uh peak similar try to come in a little
more full at dallas i had like a
a four hour way in to show
uh weigh in which sucked i didn't get to
fill out or anything so hopefully this
with this 36 hours or so that i get with
tijuana it'll be a lot better
it'll be more like nationals than it was
like the dallas europa
so with that basically the training is
going to go something like this i
deloaded
when i maintained so i reduced a bunch
of my systemic fatigue
for from the prep into the europa show
and did a five-day deload five-day
maintenance
now i'm in the hypocaloric environment
again started my heart training
uh two days ago and
right now i'm doing my pm session from
my push this morning
you're gonna see it's it's uh coming
across the screen
i'm doing let's see um i had a giant set
of tricep
uh dip machine i had a lateral delt
exercise and i had a curling exercise
um it's not super voluminous a lot of
intensity technique-based stuff so
you're going to see there's a lot of
high rep stuff the dip
i did a giant set like i said the
lateral raise it was in the 15 to 20 rep
range
and the single arm cable curls are in
themselves an intensity technique you'll
notice that i do
some pauses i treat it somewhat like a
mile web set so i really only did two
sets
but i paused a couple times if you'll
notice whenever they come across the
screen i pause
between like reps 8 10 and like 12 or
something
uh really the training's not terribly
difficult just yet because i'm trying to
ease into
this uh three-week mesocycle that i
basically have
i'm gonna be basically hitting like the
mid-range volume that i was hitting of
my last mesocycle
before the dallas europa so it'll be
very very similar
i'm adding in new variations because
novel stimulus is pretty important when
you're
going back-to-back shows or you're going
uh into a contest prep
so you'll notice when i go into uh
let's say eight weeks out where's four
weeks out i have basically all new
variations at my four week out mark
compared to my eight week out
because that novel stimulus helps you to
maintain lean tissue a little bit better
especially when you're really
hypocaloric and you're dieting down for
an extended period of time uh so same
thing here i have this these variations
in for about
three weeks um after this
i'm going to see how i do in tijuana
depending on how i do there the only
circumstance in which i continue and i
do another show
is if i get second place if i get second
place
that's gonna give me quite a bit of
points for the olympia i already have a
couple
and to stop there would suck
and if i get second place i know that i
have an enemy to get a first place
somewhere
uh i'll probably you know chicago's next
week and i might do chicago
i might go to it's either toronto or
tampa i can't remember which ones after
that and
i think tampa toronto is coming up soon
uh
but tons of pro shows this year i really
want to make
the olympia lineup on my my uh rookie
season as a pro
it'd be super cool and i really i
actually just thought of this the other
day
so i just actually noticed in my good to
great video that
we put on the rp channel which is
actually when i met our videographer
um i said
one day i will be stepping on the
olympia stage one day i'm going to be on
the olympia stage
it's going to happen uh unless i get hit
by a car
or i die tomorrow i'm going to
and to think that this is now two or
three years later
i earned my pro card and i placed top
five in my per debut
it's really it's a cool thing to look
back on and i can't be
i can't be any more grateful than the
people that i have that have come into
my life with rp
and bodybuilding and sports science and
even in just in the fitness
and education realm it's been a it's
truly been a really cool experience so
far and i'm excited to keep a long
hopefully healthy journey into the pro
stage
and onto the olympia stage and
guys let's let's uh let's get a big
fucking win for science on this one
