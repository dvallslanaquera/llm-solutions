control it beautiful
no i call bullshit no you're chewing you
it fucking hurts
it hurts to train like this man it's not
gonna feel good you say you want the
overall let's see it
talk that shit jerry no bro my boy over
here about to sort you out
oh man pink hair bro trash now whoa
watch that shit now
yeah folks jared and i will have beef
later but for now
alex has beef with his hamstrings and
quads he's got a lot of beef on him
and beef with him because he's about to
mess them up i was gonna swear
but the youtube algorithm not a big fan
of that whole thing alex how are you
feeling
uh i feel like death i'm 16 days out
from my uh
first show back in over six years so my
man so
it's exciting stuff exciting stuff jared
real quick tell us a couple things about
what we have to watch out for training
16 days out of a show
oh okay so uh
generally people are starting the
process in which they
become a little more what we call dry so
going heavy
is usually not a very good idea uh
sequestering a lot of metabolites is a
great idea so a lot of pump stuff
uh usually you're gonna be training in
the higher rep ranges at this point
because
uh lots of heavy loads can tend to cause
joint stress
they cause muscle tears as we've seen on
youtube and
instagram lately many times and just
overall a lot of systemic fatigue
so he's already very tired like he said
uh we're gonna
try not to axial load him a shitload but
he's gonna be doing some hip-hinging
today it's going to be fun
yep lots of metabolites lots of reps
plenty of sets
and short rest breaks there's going to
be a lot of suffering but the right kind
of suffering folks let's hit it
exercise number one stiff-legged
deadlifts technique is
everything here you can hold hundreds of
pounds to get
dick in your hamstrings what we need to
do is make sure we have
hips hinged so you're moving at your
hips not at your lower back
hip hinge knees should be almost
straight this is bad
this is bad this is good and same angle
all the way down
keeping that chest up slow at the bottom
milking that painful stretch
if you're getting a painful stretch in
your hamstrings you're doing this
more or less correctly couple sets five
to ten reps
then we move on afterwards to leg curls
let's do it
slower slow slow knees backwards back
and back
yes there you go better good stuff knees
back and chest up at the same time let's
do it
slow back chest
there it is good more big chest
[Music]
just slow yes feel it back there
good keep it going down slow down stop
push your hips back back
knees back knees back up here
keep those knees back the whole time
chest stays upright stay back let's go
let's go let's go yes
gentle touch oh good keep that tension
the whole time
when you're complaining don't use your
back you're using your hamstrings
keep this tight good good stop
feel it back there first oh yeah there's
something more stencil have you cooked
so at the bottom
at the bottom you're taking the tension
off your hamstrings and you're using
your lower back to pick it up
so your first move is immediately this
and then everything looks good on the
way down
but make sure on the way up you're
keeping that tight robotic lower back so
you need this to make sure it's
big chest organic posture back here so
keep the tension on the hamstrings even
at the very bottom like what i do
i don't actually set it down a little
bit it's like a light it's like a light
tap with the
with it right on the ground so it's here
boom so i'm resting
basically with it on the ground but i
have full tension in the hamstrings
there and then don't go like this it's
hamstrings
push
there it is yes but the whole time like
that
like straight just like that slow
beautiful
again slow check out slow down slow
all the way all the way and up good
again slow slow
up good again even slower you got this
couple more
we knew it was going to hurt when we
showed up today tight tight good
now bigger chest all the way down all
the way down man you got this you got
control control good couple more
[Music]
good stuff good stuff very good very
good
feeling your hamstrings on that shit
good stuff
goodbye he
hasn't ever really performed a proper
hip hinge before so
two sets of seven to ten reps whenever
you get that technique down
it's a really eccentrically damaging
exercise so two sets there
is just fine for what he just did he's
already feeling said he feels a really
good burn in his hamstrings
and now we're just gonna finish off the
hamstrings with some hamstring girls
he's been doing seated uh hamstring
curls on his
hamstring emphasis today lying leg curls
on a squat emphasis so we're going to
keep the stimulus the same here today
and we're going to do a seated hamstring
curl probably going to do about four
sets
10 to 15 rep range might even do a meyer
upset at the end see how we uh see how
he feels
but hamstring curl seated variation
good to go all right
let's do these with high quality we stop
finding the reps when you no longer can
hear a sound clanking
smash that shit in and it only count the
reps that go slow on the way back up
all the way back up okay so it's speed
and then it's quality
speed and then quality sound good
awesome
let's do our best beautiful oh
fuck yeah
[Music]
good get some speed on the way down
yes beautiful all the way up and then
speed
good all the way up yes
all the way up there you go good what
kind of keep going
speed yes
speed alex these are phenomenal keep
going we're getting all kinds of big
hamstrings today
good more pain let's go
good good look at her three more
one slow
three more more quality set let's get it
done right
oh fuck that's it there you go there you
go let's do one more for good luck one
more for good luck
fuck yeah slow and
the way to do it way to do it right
thinking about that overall the whole
time huh
i tell you what man overall yo real talk
the way like fundamentally we have
respect for everybody as human beings
but jared and i get a shitload more
respect for people that when they're in
pain
can still commit to good technique
because a lot of motherfuckers we have
over here
as soon as the pain testorized they just
start doing this shit
and we're like look are you here to
fucking get into the pain and get your
muscles going or you're here to just
survive
you want to grow do you want to stay the
same that's how it is
beautiful all the way up all the way up
get hurt make it hurt there it is yes
three more
so question could come up is why are we
going so fast on the concentric
the thing is we want a full range of
motion we want maximum hamstrings
activation
the hamstrings are actually muscle
designed to generate a ton of velocity
because they're designed for running
so if we want to maximize that
concentric velocity get as much power as
possible
because we recruit as many fast switch
motor units as possible that results in
more growth
the second question is why are we going
so slow on the eccentric and the reason
for that
is to generate a crapload of force which
you have to do for the slow to occur
and that allows the hamstrings to
lengthen under a crapload of tension and
provides a huge hypertrophic stimulus
in many not all but many exercises a
fast concentric and a very slow
eccentric is absolutely the way to go
almost certainly on leg curls give that
some thought cause some guys will say
like why don't you do the concentric
slow and leg curls
why would you you miss out a lot of
stuff four go
six all the way down forward again seven
there you go
eight beautiful five yes
ten control almost there eleven
gotta get to fifteen plank it twelve
[Music]
thirteen yes two more 14 one last one
15. beautiful oh shit extra credit time
my man good stuff good stuff that's it
for leg curls that's it for hamstrings
[Music]
leg extensions are up next switching
from hams to quads
leg extensions are a really good tool to
stimulate the quads a decent amount with
a relatively low risk and low fatigue
because these pre-contests alex can't be
risking doing super heavy stuff
the way we're going to be doing leg
essentials here is remember that the
maximum
growth component of my extension is the
super stretch portion at the bottom
so we're actually going to have him lean
back before doing the extensions and
stay lean back the whole time
just a crapload of tension on the bottom
how do we also maximize tension at the
bottom well
we use the amazing prime fitness leg
extension which actually lets you
selectorize where the tension is applied
most to your cam system
highly highly recommended we chose the
number three option or whatever
the one that allows you to experience
the most tension at the stretch not as
much as the contraction
still get a ball of peak contraction but
you get the most hypertrophic stimulus
you pretty much can get out of leg
extension
we are going to unfortunately don't tell
alex we're going to do my reps up the
ass until the cows come home
so let's have some fun
eight good relax rest
rest breathe don't get over all or not
three go three good ones there it is one
slow deep two
two yes let's get a big walk out going
here
let's go three slow
good rest
that was a good two and you're not feet
just two but quality two
squeeze yes slow
deep
yep peek it peek it yeah
fuck yeah slow slow slow good
you don't really get out of this machine
you kind of just peel your way out of it
i hope you don't your legs don't give
out all the way out today's thursday
alex has a quad workout on monday so
we're going to limit how much volume we
do to some extent to allow him to
recover
still a good stimulus we need two my rep
sets on the leg section
next up is the hack squat probably going
to do like oh three sets or so of course
also maya reps let's go get that done
[Music]
anyway when i'm not breaking machines
here at dragon's lair
with my one hand this is metal by the
way
i'm concerned about hack squat technique
in the hack squat there's a temptation
to put your feet real high up on the
machine
so you can use as little range of motion
and as much hip musculature as possible
and use as much weight as you can
and then that girl who stands by the
machine all the time i don't even know
what she's doing there she's like oh my
god poppy
you're so strong and you're all like oh
yeah do you wanna
do you wanna like do you wanna like
she's like yeah yeah let's do it and
then you know las vegas
i don't even know what i'm saying in any
case here's the right way to do hack
squats
you get your feet nice and low on the
platform
your heels still have to be generating a
ton of force if you go too low
it's just toes as low as you can with
your heel still contributing a ton of
force
and then stay nice and upright sink
slowly down
let your knees come out as you go down
toes pointed slightly out
pause fully at the bottom and then come
up
thank us later alex has a few sets of
this it's all my reps of course
do as many as all you almost can lock
out your knees
take a few big breaths go again and
again let's get the job done
get a chance to rest slow right
[Music]
just keep your knees locked up breathe a
couple take here
four whenever you're ready chest big
chest
hips open and go control it beautiful
[Laughter]
that wasn't coming up huh
good stuff good stuff i call bullshit
oh you're chewing you i felt that like
that that ish ish that good good
if that happens you have two guys that
are pretty jacked next to you
yeah we'll just fill you up
it fucking hurts it hurts to train like
this man it's not gonna feel good
you say you want the overall let's see
it let's go control control
beautiful up good good as soon as you
touch
brief rest come up slow

beautiful good shit you want to go oh do
you want to stay the same
alex is pretty fried up it's one last
set of hack squats left
we're going to do a down set he was
using 275 pounds we're now using 225
we're going to do as many mile rep mini
sets as it takes to get to 15 total reps
by jared and i sort of back in the
envelope calculation that's what it's
going to take to really fry him out
which i'm real close to failure
last set of the workout alex has been
doing phenomenal
what do we mean by phenomenal excellent
technique under the pressure of immense
pain
that's how you know you're doing a good
job anyone can feel pain and then have
shit technique
anyone who can have good technique
without pain if you're under pain
and you have great technique you're
going to get really really jacked
let's finish this off up eight two more
than your rest
control control up
nine again slow or else it doesn't
fucking count
slow slow up ten
rest breathe breathe a couple more

things
[Music]
technique never broke down always good
technique
intensity never let up he brought it
today and by the way
not all of us are like this but we can
take some inspiration this
motherfucker's in a good mood 100
of the time he just almost lost his life
to a hack squat he's still got a smile
on his face
no drama no bullshit if you come to the
gym and really enjoy the shit
you're gonna end up jacked like this guy
that's all we got for you today
jared that was good stuff you got me i'm
