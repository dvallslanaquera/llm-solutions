trained to what they call failure half
time they're not even actually doing
that kind of moving like screaming
but like how hardcore is it for you to
be in every rep and actually
like feeling the rep every and
you're in your mind the whole time like
I want to quit but you're not
it's like a marathon runner just like I
have eight Hills left in this marathon
and I know each of them gets steady and
steadier of an incline but I'm gonna
 do it so like toward the end of
your session you're like like right now
I'm just like well I still gotta control
this rep and I still gotta go
free goddamn close to failure or I could
just be like you know I'm so hardcore
