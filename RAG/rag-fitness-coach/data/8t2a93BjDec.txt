hey folks I'm Dr Mike welcome to
targeting the muscle series we have
triceps as the muscle and Skull Crushers
as the exercise and wife as the model to
demonstrate because I'm no longer
sufficiently mobile to do Skull Crushers
properly enough to illustrate them to
you you just learn to do them wrong like
my fat ass
so wife
you're not microphone so if your answers
are irrelevant perfect let's get to it
tip number one is in the skull crusher
it is ideal to have your elbows in as
much as possible
on the way down it is critical on the
way up it's probably okay to flare them
a little bit to use your chest to help
out a tad because then it allows a
crapload of eccentric overload for
something that you may not be able to
get as many concentrics with super
elbows in elbows in on the way down is a
must and then way up if it organically
just comes out a little bit that's no
big deal it's not crazy in my book just
don't turn it into a bench press
you're gonna notice where Crystal puts
the bar and it's going to be on her
throat sounds awkward I'm not in maybe
also in
I will address that later so save your
questions for later and by save your
questions I mean type them in right now
having not gotten to that section in the
comments it's great for the algorithm
let's get this done so
here is the bar and do you grab
and notice if she's going to do it wrong
she's going to flare her shit out and
turn it into kind of a close grip
something rather
if she's going to do it right
she is going to start with her elbows
flush in and go nice and deep
perfect elbows stay super straight and
she's going to come up and she's really
awesome as she comes up she's also going
to keep her elbows straight that is the
ideal if they flare a bit I just
wouldn't worry about it one more rep
honey on the way in perfect and all the
way up
beautiful
tip number two is to make sure that you
think about at least trying this out
breaking forward at the elbows instead
of back at the elbows to initiate the
movement
we'll show you what this means in a
second this is something that I
discovered helps my elbow Health a ton I
posted some Instagram skull crusher tips
and a bunch of people get in there and
they're like yeah you look do these if
you want to destroy your elbows I don't
know how that sounds like a tough guy
saying my elbows are made out of literal
vaginas but in any case
you can solve that problem in most cases
if you start reaching back right away
you can get tons of elbow pain in my
experience and that of many others I
have coached if you break forward to
your hips and then down just by a smidge
it's the same thing that's in a squat
instead of breaking at your knees and
going down like that feels awkward even
to demonstrate you break at the hips
gently by a little and then you let your
knees go makes your elbows feel right as
rain
okay so grab this
do it wrong first Crystal
where you just reach back yeah it can
work for people this can work but
sometimes it'll have non-consensual sex
with your elbows on the other hand the
proper way watch her elbows will shoot
towards her hips and then the bar
descends elbows to hips and then go down
just really briefly elbows to hips and
then we descend just like that it puts a
ton of stretch on the tricep it does
everything we want properly and it keeps
those elbows greasy is that good yeah
yeah do you feel grease in your elbows
excellent that's gross
[Music]
tip number three is super individualized
first and super varied second
you're gonna do this tip however you
feel is best for you and there could be
more than one correct answer
the Q here or the correction or the
recommendation is where are we touching
because there's a lot of fake
controversy on the internet about what a
proper skull crusher looks like
let me give you guys a tour of options
like a Tour de France except drug tested
properly no none of that untested real
Tour de France grab that shit
option number one that is totally valid
and totally fine if your elbows can take
it and you feel a great connection with
a tricep is actually Crystal this may be
your first time doing this but you've
heard that a lot lately huh
touch the bar to the bench right behind
you right above your head
bullshit ocean my little tiny alarms go
boom that's a thing and then press up
okay that's a thing people do one more
time just for the viewers go all the way
and literally just rest it on the bench
behind you and come up
feels weird right yeah especially with
my short arms yes you need longer arms
so just work on that and we'll come back
next time great the next option is to
touch your forehead the usual the
classic skull crusher
perfect yep one more just for the
viewers
notice these are all done under full
control we'll talk about that a bit
great option number three is to touch
the nose look at the little baby nose
he's adorable beautiful just touch your
nose
people will see me do this online and
say I'm kissing the barbell false I'm I
only kiss one woman isn't that right
what was her name all right uh even
Scott the video guy like that one
Scott's a video guy is a total piece of
shit so he loves jokes like that
another option is to touch the chin give
that a shot
beautiful and that's great and then
option number last is this is a killer
not everyone can pull this off you have
to have the right proportions crystal
sure does is the throat
holy shit we're risking life and limb
for this one but it can feel amazing
beautiful Crystal thank you so much I
will take that now which option is right
for you again depends on do you feel it
ripping your triceps into shreds
first question second question
how are your shoulder joints feeling how
are your elbow joints feeling some of
these you'll try and you'll be like fuck
that I'm gonna be Mr Potato Head shit
will fall off Midway through fuck it
don't do that find one that works for
you it could be a couple of them and
then you have three or two or even four
different variations you can program for
a few months at a time throughout the
year
no wrong answers fundamentally the
technique setup is the same it's just
where the arc takes you and where you
actually hit on various parts of your
body
none of these are particularly more
dangerous than any one of them some of
them cause a bit more shearing Force
some cost less some will involve other
muscles like the lats if you touch
behind your head and you have back day
the next day you might find that you
actually have lat soreness just play
around with that stuff I'm just giving
you guys a ton of options and letting
you just dive into that all you can eat
buffet but do not get the fucking
potatoes into the macaroni and cheese I
swear to God we're gonna have a fucking
problem
[Music]
all right folks next tip is to make sure
you go slow and controlled on the way
down yes if you rush the Reps you can do
more reps and the big skull crusher rep
counter in the sky goes up and God's
sitting up there in heaven he's like yes
that's pretty good pretty good but you
end up with smaller triceps and a more
likely probability of injury
which while you're on this Mortal Earth
is bad
so Crystal is going to demonstrate
the throat skull crusher this is for
sure going to turn into a meme uh yeah
like that's fine you know but uh it
would be better if she went a little
slower so we're going to control
arguably pause and come up
slow in control pause for that deep
stretch and come up
as the Italian Americans say
beautiful
alright next tip is about where to put
your hands
and this is one of these patented
Dr Mike and RP answers of we don't
really give you an answer we just tell
you to go fuck yourself and say
intellectual shit that sounds like an
answer just kidding sort of there is no
correct answer about where to put your
hands that can be generally applied
close totally fine
medium totally fine even wide can be
fine in some occasions
where you put your hands and if you use
a straight bar or an easy bar
is up to you the individual to decide
but we're not just going to leave you
with that let's bullshit stock Instagram
it depends answer it depends on how
three things go
thing one is how do your elbows feel
thing two is how do your shoulders feel
thing three is how do your triceps
actually feel are they getting a good
hit
if you pick a grip that someone on the
internet with no degree in biomechanics
no posts on Instagram said is optimal or
whatever kind of bullshit they're saying
nowadays and you do it and your elbows
hurt like shit your shoulders feel like
they're gonna fall out and you don't
really feel a whole lot in your triceps
that's the fucking wrong answer
if you try another grip which people
said was bad and don't do it's terrible
and your elbows feel golden brown your
shoulders feel unbelievable and your
triceps feel like they're being torn to
shreds you have found the
for now correct answer why'd I say for
now
because our bodies change over time
our muscles and Joints adapt to stresses
over time they become resistant to
hypertrophy from certain angles over
time so if you realize that for yourself
both this grip
and this grip work roughly equally well
you can do a couple of months of this
grip until it gets really stale and it's
kind of nagging things and triceps
aren't getting a huge pump anymore
and getting in on this grip and all of a
sudden it feels fresh amazing and new
you just go back and forth on them
instead of just having one skull crusher
exercise to program you have two I just
multiplied your skull crusher exercises
for you next am I going to multiply your
wealth absolutely I have a Forex Trading
account I do crypto Scott what other
kind of bullshit is out there
I'm a wealth manager I'll take over your
portfolio get you into gold oh nfts nfts
I do only I am an nft you feel me and
you will be one too if you sign up for
my nft now course dot net
let's get to the last tip already
[Music]
all right folks last tip of the day
the Smith machine
it exists some gentleman named Smith
clearly invented it you can put a bench
in here into Smith machine Skull
Crushers for another excellent variation
in addition to your barbell and easy bar
work I would recommend that if there is
a slant to your machine
you face your
genitals into the direction of the slant
so here the slant goes out so I would
lay back this way on a bench so that as
I go down
shit pulls my triceps forward for me it
feels unbelievable it's a huge stretch
if I was to turn it it would pull my
triceps back and instead of reducing
this elbow angle and getting a huge
stretch at the bottom it kind of pulls
everything apart feels kind of weird
turns into a bit more lats if the other
way works better for you forget what I'm
saying and do it but you probably want
to do it in the direction I'm talking
about
combo tip here tip number whatever sub a
here's sub B
inverted Skull Crushers are a thing and
they're fucking awesome it's what Skull
Crushers are to bench press
these things are two push-ups so a Smith
machine is the perfect place to do them
you can also do them in the rack if you
just have a rack at home find a comfy
height
put your grip wherever you normally do
skull crusher grip take a comfy foot
position away you'll have to experiment
as to where you want to touch and then
you bend your elbows in and you let's
say touch the chin and come up keep your
elbows in on the way down all the same
identical cues as a skull crusher you
can do it to your throat you can do it
to your face anything you want you can
do it to your face where you put your
feet is going to depend a ton on your
height bar position arm length Etc
there's no right answer but within a few
warm-ups you'll realize where all the
good stuff is and here's a really cool
thing
when you start warming up start at a
high height if you're not super duper
crazy strong you're going to have to
keep it at a pretty high height if you
are stronger as you warm up you drop the
shit and it mechanically makes this more
difficult if you're a fucking superhero
you put the shit all the way down and if
you're like
Amazo the Android from DC Superhero you
can even put your feet on a box and then
do these almost at a decline holy
fucking shit
it's amazing life is amazing isn't life
beautiful folks click click
click the stupid fucking video go
outside look at trees interact with
people find a random person on the
street and just give them a hug and if
they don't want it slip a fucking get
that underhook in and give them a hug
anyway against their will they'll agree
to it eventually don't take any of that
advice folks
any of the advice you hear you you saw
here on Skull Crushers hopefully it
works for you if it doesn't feel free to
ask me a question in the comments and uh
I'll get one of my Butlers to answer it
see you guys next time
[Music]
this is how you do this understand
