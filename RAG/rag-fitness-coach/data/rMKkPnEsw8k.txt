so
hey folks can you lift on instagram over
here with me
doing a leg workout a very special leg
workout
that is nicknamed plutonium i wonder why
can't be dangerous or anything like that
here's what's on the menu we have
four sets of high bar paw squats
followed by
four sets of hack squats all in the
heavy range
five to ten reps per set probably a
little bit at the higher end
and then some high rep leg curls after
that quad and ham workout for today
let's follow along paul is going this is
a peak week workout
so it's high volume and everything is
going to be close to failure
this may be the last time you see this
man alive on camera but he's super tough
stay tuned
big breath in before you go descend
pause
come up breathe out
[Music]
up breathe out
up so in a peak week this is a peak week
of training
most exercisers who want to go to
concentric failure can't do anymore
in the case of most leg exercises
specifically squats
also lock process and hack squats you
don't want to go all the way to failure
because when that happens the weight
falls on you and you die
so for these super hard core compound
leg
movements where the weight could fall on
us we stop about one rep shy failure so
you'll notice paul is stopping
when the weight seems to be pretty tough
and you think man i feel like he's got
another one we stop when he's got
another one so that we don't
accidentally fail
due to a technical blunder at the bottom
and real bad happens
so for all of your other exercises where
the bar can't fall on you for sure go
all the way to failure your last week of
training
before you deal it but for things like
this that can fall on top of you which
includes bench presses if you don't have
a spotter especially
don't go all the way to failure stop one
rep show you'll get basically the same
hypertrophy results
less fatigue totally good to go
up four great
up five beautiful let's go
[Music]
up six good come on
up one more breathe
get your together
[Music]
up stand up go go go rack
eight very good very good
[Music]
so four sets of squats later paul's
still alive
that was a sense of five to ten reps
probably starting around 10 and s
fatigue kicks in going towards five
and then now we're on the hack squats
our second exercise for the day in our
last quad exercise
another four sets up on deck here sets
of five to ten reps a little bit closer
to that 10 range basically sets of eight
to 10.
you get us a great combination of super
high tension and with four sets a really
high volume
time to get to work up
great
up great one last one
whenever you're ready paul ready
up beautiful rack
our goal with these sets is to get into
five to ten rep range
as paul was fatiguing he started out
around 10 reps but now after a couple
sets
he's getting awfully close to five we
don't have to drop below five because we
want a good number of repetitions to
keep the movement maximally effective
sets of less than five reps don't tend
to promote as much growth so we're gonna
do is take off a little bit of weight
to bump his reps back up to around 10 so
he gets more reps and finish off this
exercise
on an excellent high quality matter up
breathe rest don't go anywhere
[Music]
two more
[Applause]
up good come on
[Music]
up and one last one
[Music]
[Applause]
yes beautiful
oh man
good man good
[Music]
so paul is almost dead that's the bad
news the good news is he's still alive a
couple sets of hamstring curls
the reason you know we could have
designed this workout with two compound
quad movements and a final compound ham
movement like
good morning stuff like a deadlift but
honestly the central dive just
is not there after that many eight sets
of super super hard super heavy quads
paul is really toasted lying down for
this much easier
some good high quality hamstring work
we'll have other workouts for quads and
hams where there's much more hems
the hamstrings come first they're much
harder and then the quads are later this
is definitely a quad priority workout
we're just going to get in here
multiple sets of roughly 10 to 20 reps
get some good stimulus to the hams
head home try not to die try to hit your
butt every time
there you go better four
five six
seven eight effort paul
nine let's go ten rest
good go 14
more 15 more paul
16 one more go 17 rest
don't go anywhere three go
one all the way up go
two last one go
yeah that's it that's it good stuff
good stuff
[Music]
folks that's it that's the whole workout
four sets of paused squats
high bar four sets of hack squats and
then to finish it off
four sets of hamstring curls five to ten
rep range for the first two exercises
10 to 20 for the last if you want to try
this quad and hamstring workout
by all means be safe have a spotter and
uh
don't sit in a past life like paul and
cause yourself a whole lot of pain
see you next time for another awesome
awesome workout
[Music]
you
