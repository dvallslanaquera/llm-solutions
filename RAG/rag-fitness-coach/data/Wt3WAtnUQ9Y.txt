hey guys dr israel here and we're on to
lecture number five
we're getting really in detail in
oxidative phosphorylation and also
fat metabolism and beta oxidation just
an
overview here lots of details we're
going to be skimming over
that you should probably already have a
good familiarity with especially reading
the slides will get you really caught up
with that
so here we have the krebs cycle
the second part of oxidative
phosphorylation oxidative
phosphorylation we'll just start with
carbohydrate first
it's really straightforward there are
three distinct processes
the first is actually glycolysis we take
carbohydrate
and we break it down we take glucose we
break it down into pyruvate
once we've broken glucose down to the
pyruvate each glucose molecule gives us
two pyruvate molecules
the pyruvates flow over to the krebs
cycle we're very complex process
in the krebs cycle we start with a
pyruvate it really quickly gets turned
into acetyl coa it goes through the
krebs cycle
and we get a couple of really important
things the most important parts of which
so remembering glycolysis we made atp
and some other stuff
in glycolysis we also essentially took
electrons and protons hydrogen atoms
off of those glucose molecules and
slapped them on to
electron transformers nad
and fad plus which now with their
hydrogens are nadh and fadh2
they are ill they are hydrogen
transporters
those hydrogen transporters are really
important for us in the electron
transport chain
where most of the energy of oxidative
phosphorylation is really derived we'll
get to that in just a bit
so during glycolysis we break down
glucose into pyruvate and we get
some uh hydrogen transporters
nadh and fadh2 to shuttle over to the
electron transport chain
during the krebs cycle we make a variety
of things we make some atp
we get some carbon dioxide to leave but
we start with basically a pyruvate it
gets
turned into an acetyl-coa really quickly
so we start with an acetyl-coa
and through that process the most
important part of the krebs cycle is the
creation of more nadh and fath2
so we get an electron and a proton and
aviation fhd to grab those and transport
them to the electron transport chain
where they'll really be needed to
produce a ton of energy for us later
so the basic number one goal of the
krebs cycle
is to take pyruvate turn it into acetyl
coa
and get those protons and electrons off
of that molecule
and get them to the electron transport
chain now
let's take a look
at the electron transport chain
let's get a better graph for you guys
boo the electron transport chain
number one is we'll have videos in a bit
you guys have these in your slides you
must watch the videos about the electric
electron transport chain after you watch
those videos they're really cool
animations
it's going to be like duh and it's going
to be the simplest thing in the world
here's what happens in the electron
transport chain
you start off with electrons that you
got from nadh and fedh2 so remember
during glycolysis
and during the krebs cycle we've loaded
electrons and protons onto nadh
onto nad and fad and
we made nadh and fadh2 out of them and
we've taken those
hydrogen transporters and we've taken
them to the electron transport chain to
the beginning of the chain
so what happens is the electrons from
those molecules are donated
to the first cytochrome or essentially
the first part of the electron transport
chains the electrons clip onto that
first molecule
and the protons the actual hydrogen
themselves
get pumped into the intra mitochondrial
membrane
into the inter membrane space of the
mitochondria so they're pumped into a
compartment
just above this electron transport chain
and the electrons
are passed into the first molecule at
the end of this chain
we have an oxygen molecule sitting their
weight
the oxygen molecule is really
electronegative
it really wants to bind to those
electrons
and each one of these cytochromes or
these
essentially these molecules that are on
that mitochondrial membrane
are more electronegative than the last
so what happens is
the electrons pass from one cytochrome
to another and get
closer and closer and closer and
eventually bond to oxygen
so the electrons start at the first
cytochrome
and they go all the way down the chain
down the electron transport chain
and they go to a lower lower energy
level every single time until they end
up in oxygen
there's a catch during each transition
or most of the transitions from one
molecule to another
as the electrons are being passed they
lose a bit of energy
and that energy is taken to pump protons
all right hydrogen ions with no electron
from
inside the mitochondria to just outside
the mitochondria or the inter membrane
space
so from very inside of the mitochondria
to the outer layer
so we have a bunch of protons now in
this layer of mitochondria
and there's not a lot of protons inside
so we're using the power of electrons
as they jump from one molecule to the
from one molecule to another
to pump protons from inside the
mitochondria to a special inter membrane
space
what we're left with at the end of that
process is
that electrons bond to oxygen but also
all in good that forms water
but we have a ton of protons in one
section of the mitochondria
using this process we've taken those
protons and show them over that took
energy and we have almost no protons
inside the mitochondria itself
so there's this compartment on the
outside of the mitochondria has tons of
protons in it
and the inside has almost no protons
that forms a really big proton gradient
those protons are really positively
charged
they want to go desperately into the
mitochondria and guess what
there's a molecule that lets them go
through it's a channel protein that sits
in the middle of those two membranes
and it allows those protons to go right
through into the mitochondria where they
want to be
but those protons carry a ton of energy
with them because they desperately want
to go as fast as possible
that molecule takes that energy and uses
it to build
atp literally if you watch the animation
this is made very very clear
so to review that's how atp is made in
oxidative phosphorylation
we start off with glycolysis and abunda
it makes energy itself and that's all
well and good but it takes
a bunch of electrons and protons for us
and it transports them
over to the electron transport chain
then we go through the krebs cycle with
that pyruvate we have turns into acetyl
coa
goes to the krebs cycle makes a bunch of
other stuff make some energy great
that's fine not a ton of energy
but it takes even more electrons and
protons and moves them over to the
electron transport chain
it takes those protons and leaves them
just in the mitochondria
and it takes those electrons and puts
them on the first part of the electron
transport chain
as those electrons are passed for link
to link to link in the chain from
molecule to molecule to molecule
those molecules steal some of that
energy and use that energy to pump those
hydrogen ions or those protons
out into the intra mitochond intra
membrane space of the mitochondria so
they take that
the protons and the protons leave from
inside the mitochondria
build up and build up and build up just
outside
the only way for them to get back in and
they desperately want to get back in
is to go through a channel protein
called atp
synthase and that protein allows
those ions to go through just like they
want and it uses their energy
as they travel through it's kind of like
a hydroelectric dam
water goes through and it spins a wheel
and you can make stuff right you can
trap
energy it's exactly the same way
hydrogens go through that protein
and what ends up happening is we use
that energy to manufacture atp
if this sounds confusing which i'm sure
it does watch
those videos that are coming up in a
slide you guys have all that information
it will be very very crystal clear what
happens all right
we're going to skip a bunch of slides
but it just covered most of the material
let's take a look ooh amazing animation
watch these videos multiple times and
turn off the volume i promise it's worth
it
all right let's see now
so we've covered that process and that's
how it works with carbohydrates
how does it work with fats well it turns
out it's very very similar process
but it doesn't usually start in
glycolysis it actually starts in the
krebs cycle i'm going to try to make
this as simple as i can
yeah you know we've got that
mobilization usually your fat sits in
your fat cells or in your muscles
and it's made of glycerol and three
fatty acids fat mobilization and then
lead pollicis
is when we take the glycerol off and we
get actual glycerol by itself and three
fatty acid chains we've got some uh
picture of that in a second there we go
here's glycerol molecule three fatty
acid chains next to it
all right and lipolysis is the process
of removing each fatty acid chain
from the glycerol itself now glycerol
it turns out is basically functions like
a carbohydrate it goes right into
glycolysis and it follows essentially
that pathway
all the way that i just described in
oxidative phosphorylation
however where do these fatty acid chains
go we know we can make a ton of energy
out of fats
but do these fat acid chains starting
glycolysis well they can't they don't
have any oxygen they go don't go through
glycolysis
they start in the krebs cycle but before
we can prep them for the krebs cycle
we have to do something called beta
oxidation really actually kind of a
simple process
here's beta oxidation with a big picture
just look at this side right here
here's a fatty acid chain right and we
know that the citric acid cycle
or the krebs cycle starts with an acetyl
coa
that's how you start it even before
pyruvate comes in for recalculus it has
to get changed into acetyl coa
and then it goes through the krebs cycle
and into the electron transport chain
and everything is gold so the question
is
how do we get this fatty acid into the
krebs cycle and the answer is very
simple we go through a process called
beta oxidation
which takes the fatty acid and chops
them up into acetyl coas
that's it it's literally that simple so
beta oxidation takes a huge long fatty
acid
chops it up into a bunch of
acetylcholase once you have the
acetylcholase you just send each one
over to the krebs cycle it goes through
their creme cycle
makes nadh fadh2 they go to the electron
transport chain
voila atp so you guys can review these
slides and it's going to help a lot look
at the details here
but essentially the most important
component of beta oxidation
is those chopped up acetylchoates that
go into the krebs cycle
in addition to that beta oxidation
actually makes some atp of its own that
process and it actually makes some
electron or hydrogen transporters it
makes some nadhs and fadh2s
also but does pale in comparison for how
much energy we get
from actually cutting up those fatty
acid chains
and making acetyl coas once we have
acetyl coas each acetyl-coa gets us a
ton of atps because it goes through the
krebs cycle and it makes tons of atp for
us later in the electron transport chain
so the big picture the number one way we
get energy from beta oxidation
is chopping up fatty acids to get acetyl
coas to enter into the krebs cycle
otherwise known as the strogatis citric
acid cycle
if you know that you're well on your way
to understanding what bait oxidation is
all about
all right here's a complex diagram you
can look through this it'll make sense
it essentially has a fatty acid and it's
glycerol
and it says it shows where everything
goes the glycerol ends up going
through uh glycolysis and the fatty
acids into both debate oxidation
entering the citric acid cycle and then
they eventually go on to the electric
transport chain
so it's all pretty straight forward
don't let this kind of stuff confuse you
and we'll definitely cover the details
in class as well
all right so that's how fat is oxidized
we just covered all this stuff
protein metabolism very rare
mostly it occurs less than five percent
in the human body unless we're starving
and then it occurs more
generally speaking some amino acids can
actually enter glycolysis directly
all right some amino acids can get
converted
into uh pyruvate and eventually into
glucose in uh what's called the glucose
alanine cycle
that occurs mostly in emergency
situations and
this feeds into the quarry cycle so the
uh alien cycle actually converts alanine
to pyruvate which is very similar to
lactate and the corey cycle finishes the
process
off by converting the lactate or
pyruvate into
glucose in the liver so these two things
paired together can take amino acids and
convert them essentially into
carbohydrates and put those
carbohydrates
into glycolysis so amino acids can still
be digested
some of them go directly into glycolysis
some of them
need more prepping and some of them go
with a couple of steps of prep
only into these krebs cycles so some of
them never enter glycolysis to begin
with
but this is a bit complicated and it
only happens under very rare occasion
every single time an amino acid this is
very important to remember
every single time an amino acid enters
either glycolysis or the krebs cycle
it's nitrogen has to be removed uh this
is called
deamination and it's the removal of
nitrogen along with
three hydrogens which is ammonia it's
potentially harmful to cell
cellular activity but that's only if it
goes really haywire that almost never
happens
in normal metabolisms what you do is you
pair that ammonia into urea and you pee
it out
if you have a high protein diet you
don't drink a lot of water you'll pee or
be a really funky
all shade of yellow and brown that's how
you know you're putting out a lot of
ammonia
drinking water and eating a mixed diet
everything will be okay
all right and as far as oxidative
capacity
what determines so we just learned about
oxidative phosphorylation what really
determines how powerful
of an oxidative phosphorylation system
do you have what determines how much
atp can you make from oxidative
phosphorylation
number one is how much mitochondria do
you have
how big are your mitochondria if you
have lots of slow twitch muscle fibers
chock full of mitochondria
if you train your slow switch fibers get
bigger
they add more mitochondria you get more
enzymes per each mitochondrion
that all ends up allowing you to have
essentially more krebs cycles and more
electron transport chains
and they quite literally make more atp
another way
to enhance oxidative phosphorylation
capability is remember we need oxygen to
be that final electron acceptor so
another question is not just do we have
a lot of mitochondria
but can we get oxygen to where it's
needed in the mitochondria
and that's a supply problem so the best
way to get a really powerful oxidative
phosphorylation system
number one have lots of mitochondria
chock full of enzymes that usually
happens through training
and number two have lots of uh
hemoglobin
red blood cells to get that oxygen to
your muscles and have
lots of capillaries in an advanced
vascular network to make sure
all that blood gets to where it's
supposed to it gets to the muscles
and the oxygen gets there too so
endurance athletes
not only do they have lots of
mitochondria really big stores of
mitochondria not only are their
mitochondria really chock full of
enzymes
but their muscles are really well
vascularized so that blood
can easily get to those muscles and
deliver the oxygen where it needs to be
and i think that's about it
see you for the next presentation
