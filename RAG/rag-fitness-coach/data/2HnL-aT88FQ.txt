let's go charlie close it out let's go
baby
[Music]
so uh yesterday for my first
bodybuilding show
ever um i ended up winning the
open super heavyweight class and then
going on to win the overall bodybuilding
class
the super heavyweight class that i
competed in and the competitors i had
against me
were very well-rounded they're actually
competitive
so it was really good to have that
experience against you know guys of
quality size
and you know decent leanness you know
next to me on stage
also uh the format of the show was
closely around
as i'm told towards more like a national
show rather than like a local show
so that was also fun it was really fast
paced so it gave me a lot of good
experience
really awesome data collection on
what to do for my peak leading up to its
day of peaking which jared feather
one of our elite physique uh coaches
at rp helped me with he was there all
day with me
handling me literally
grabbing me when needed to when i needed
to get somewhere
on time telling me exactly what to drink
and eat literally handing me the like
the bottle drink three ounces of this
drank it go pump did it
stage do it all that so that made it
super easy i felt super comforted
so yeah i've been asked a lot like oh
man are you nervous
about you know getting up on stage are
you nervous about your first show
and uh yeah honestly i wasn't nervous at
all
uh anxious is more uh accurate term
uh i was anxious to do it i just wanted
like man i've worked so long it seemed
you know 18 weeks since january
4th or 5th leading up to this um
and you know all the years prior to that
just training dieting correctly
it's like hey this is my first show
let's get it done nothing to be nervous
about
you know you know kind of uh used to
being in those sparkly underwear in
front of uh people at the gym
that's what helps at the practice it's
just not be nervous for
people on stage i thought i'd be my
head a lot but there was no time you'd
hit the stage
and lights are in front of you you're
not sure what's going on
you can't really see many people because
it's just blinding
and then you hear just po you know the
poses come out boom boom boom boom boom
boom you're done there's no time to feel
anything to be honest
after like prejudging an am you know
of course you know my crew was you know
dating them they're all saying like
dude you got this i'm like maybe who
knows you know anything happened
maybe they know you got this and then
other people saying you got this and
online you know people there like dude
that's clear i'm like
you know you never know anything can
happen now i gotta do my the overall
posing
at no point in time was i in the center
and had any sort of confidence that like
i had this in the back
if anything it made me go fuck i gotta
try harder i gotta hold these i gotta
make sure i'm on point
because i can really fuck up now they're
looking at me i think maybe look at me
oh my god
so uh luckily uh jared gave me
super super super helpful
posing pointers like on the spot let's
go charlie ground up
and stream glue there you go beautiful
and um yeah they gotta say overall
winner
charlie zhang mega you see me on camera
she's like
oh oh okay uh thank you
i'm like kind of confused i go up and
i'm not sure what to look i'm like do i
i pose
and yeah that's that's pretty much it
it's like you know your friends are
there to support you i was happy because
they were happy
like they're like are you proud i'm like
i know i don't care about i'm happy that
you're happy
i'm happy that i didn't let anyone down
and that's about it
like are you happy that you but you want
i'm like yeah that's yeah fine
i'm like are you happy that i won i'll
process it all a little more
in the next few days i guess but uh yeah
that was pretty much the experience
everyone wants to know charlie what was
your first
meal after the show first food
fuck eating you know how thirsty i was
god damn it
oh my god you have to stay dry the whole
time without staying cramping up you
have
that balance you can't drink a lot of
fluids or you like just get bloated
so the first thing i did down some you
know tasty dexterous and way
and then after that we waited an hour
and then like let's get pizza
and um consensus
pretty good but also it was the first
pizza i had in over half a year so
who knows um i had about
a pizza and a quarter i felt very very
bloated
afterwards um and then yeah i went to
sleep
anyway what's next uh take a few days
dealer
and enjoy myself do another week and a
half of
rebound training you know um
and then take about two weeks off of
active rest
which is when i just make sure i hit you
know
my part really a target protein and then
the rest of it
you know fuck all you know eat whatever
i want at that point not overdo it
if i went over to it fucking i do that
too but just eat comfortably whatever
no training i'm not allowed to train
whatsoever uh and then mass phase starts
for a few mesos and then we are rolling
into my next competition which will
hopefully
nationals mpc nationals
npc nationals in orlando like are you
doing because your pro card like i mean
i mean i would love to get my pro card
but it's mostly to see how i stack
up against that level of competition
because that will
uh largely affect how i approach this
next
year of training after that yeah that's
the main reason i'm doing the
nationals is kind of a figure out
what my next step is for the next year
