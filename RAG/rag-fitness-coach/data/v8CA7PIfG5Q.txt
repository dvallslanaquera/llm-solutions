oh my goodness we're back it's the
bi-weekly q a with dr james and dr mike
dr mike how's it going
very good james how are you i am good i
am ready for some
q a you got questions we got answers
all right and on that note our first
contestant
is aries mole
let's find harry
there he is all
hairy real quick folks just a friendly
refresher for those of you who have been
with us and for any of you guys who are
joining us for the first couple times
the way this works is people submit
their questions on the comments section
on the
latest webinar and then the ones that
get upvoted the most
or the ones that dr mike and i find most
compelling if they weren't upvoted that
much
uh we'll get the picks for the top 10 of
the week so
the way that it works is if you have a
question first thing to do is scan the
comments to see if anybody else has
already asked that question or is asked
a similar question
and if they have you can go ahead and
upload it and if not then you can pop
yours in
and hopefully other people will see
yours and upload it as well and we'll
take usually the top 10 most upvoted
unless we scroll through and see one
that's really interesting
yep so please vote vote vote
all right and vote they did
very small and he said
are there any significant downsides to
being more active slash having a larger
energy expenditure and therefore eating
more calories compared to having a lower
energy expenditure
and eating less on a mass phase so
yes and there's kind of a middle ground
where you want to be
and that middle ground is this if you
are very very inactive
your propensity to gain body fat is
probably going to be a little bit higher
even if you have your calories squared
away because cardio does a lot
uh really good stuff for fat burning and
to some extent
some physical activity actually
potentiates recovery
uh sometimes via blood flow sometimes by
other mechanisms
some bit of cardio actually helps you
reduce
uh fatigue and anxiety and
helps you sleep and all this other stuff
and it's also very healthy for you
so uh and it could also keep you
slightly leaner for longer
which means you have a more productive
and longer uninterrupted mass phase
and so some cardio is good but if you
jack up the cardio
to a certain point it becomes a downside
and i'll tell you what that downside is
is possible so you know he said
more active having a larger energy
expenditure so we're not assuming
that he's doing tons of cardio right
we're just assuming
he's being more active walking around
more
going shopping walk the dog maybe
walking while you talk on the phone
instead of sitting down stuff like that
and that stuff is generally very good
up to the point at which you feel
fatigued from it
so if you're not fatigued from your
activity and you feel energized and
great and it's fun
then you're probably either benefiting
or seeing no costs
during a mass phase as long as you can
eat the food to meet that demand
if you are like oh man like i've been on
my feet all day and i'm super exhausted
that it doesn't just have to affect your
workouts it can affect your recovery
from workouts too so for example
if you work out in the morning when
you're fresh and then you go work at a
restaurant where you walk 25 000 steps a
day
and by the end you're totally pooped i
mean being totally pooped is not that
great
so if your cardio is so low that you
feel like a sloth
and that if you do more activity then
you feel better
and fresher and more recovered and more
alive and leaner
all that's great and you can keep
increasing your physical activity slowly
and gingerly i'm telling unless you
distinctly understand and feel
that you're actually starting to tire
out a little bit and if you
you find yourself thinking like man if i
didn't have to be so active today
i could like really rest and recover and
eat yep you're being too active and i
think that's the point at which
any more cardio or sorry any more
physical activity is probably a negative
uh and yes these are very subjective
uh cutoffs but also they're quite easy
to understand
uh and i think there's a benefit there
james yeah that was a very good answer
and
you know everybody responds a little bit
differently to physical activity and so
for some people like if you can
if you're a waitress and you're doing 25
000 steps like in dr mike's example some
people can shrug that off and it really
doesn't affect them that much and it's
okay
whereas like if that was me or i'm gonna
i'm gonna assume dr mike as well as in
this camp
uh that would affect me significantly
and it would definitely impact my
systemic fatigue or even my local
fatigue if it meant like i had to be on
my feet
my back my legs would definitely be
feeling it the next day
other people you know it's everybody's a
little bit different so you might have
some people who actually get
some of their best training by training
really really hard and then being a
couch potato the rest of the day
why well because they're they're highly
recovered in a really good state of
preparedness all the time because
they're not doing shit the rest of the
day right so
some people will respond a little bit
better in that regard
and the lack of other activity hopefully
is not affecting their health and cardio
is in a real significant way because
their training their training is enough
at that point
other people like dr mike said tend to
benefit a little bit from just having
some baseline level of activity whether
that's from your job or commuting or
just other hobbies that you have
and so as dr mike said when systemic
fatigue or in the in even worse case
local fatigue becomes a limiting factor
from the activities
that's when it really starts to become a
problem i make the joke for myself
because i'm
a part-time lumberjack now a lot of the
the log stuff that i do for chopping
wood and keeping the house warm
absolutely affects me and my training i
could be training my arms and my
shoulders a lot more
if i wasn't doing that but it's a
lifestyle trade-off so again everybody's
a little bit different
you have to kind of find where that
sweet spot is for yourself
yeah 100
all right next up is andrew and he's
corrected
his name is andrew atchison
where are you i can't find okay we're
doing control f andrew
oh i put amdrew i'm an idiot andrew
there we go
gotcha all right he says hi ducks can
you talk about the theory
uh beer slash alcohol inhibits muscle
protein synthesis
please um yeah
so there's probably been pretty good
demonstrations and animal models of
direct inhibition of alcohol at higher
levels
in addition to that alcohol probably has
changes for hormonal balance that are
not
great for the relationship of estrogen
to testosterone
in addition to that alcohol generally
imposes
uh great intuits exposure a degree of
fatigue
and toxicity we actually cover this in
our recovery book
and alcohol in addition to that can
enhance your or sorry to detract from
your sleep quality
so all those things combined means that
the direct chemical effect of muscle
growth inhibition is not the only one of
your concerns with alcohol exposure
james did i miss anything i mean yeah so
there are some
direct effects as dr mike already said
so we've actually seen at the cellular
level like
a dose-response relationship with
alcohol and the things that affect
protein synthesis right
but really i think what's most important
in practical are the indirect effects
which might touched on which is like
it affects your ability to sleep and
then you have downstream effects of like
okay well if you're not sleeping well
you're not recovering well from training
then you're not actually able to present
the same level of overloads in your
training which then is going to
influence how much muscle growth you
have so you kind of have
both a shitty cocktail see what i did
there
of direct and indirect effects here and
for me
i think the indirect effects are also
the most damning and practical because
if you are having a lot of alcohol to
the point where you're not able to train
at your best like well if you're not
training at your best then
you certainly aren't going to be getting
your best growth potential right um i
think
really here i think people get really
worked up about the alcohol issue
everything in moderation of course right
so if you have
recreational a couple if you drink
recreationally a couple times per week
are you going to see muscle loss
no you're going to see less growth
that's kind of the idea here
if you find yourself being inebriated
more often than not like drinking to the
point of inebriation
more than you are sober are you going to
start to see muscle loss
probably over time if you're drunk all
the time are you going to see muscle
loss immediately
yes and that's just because your life is
in shambles at that point so you're
going to have the direct effects of the
dose response of alcohol
and you're just not going to be able to
train because you're a drunk bastard so
keep keep that in mind there's
definitely a dose response and a
lifestyle
uh and you know you we all know a guy or
a girl
who can drink everyone under the bus and
seems to be
fine like everybody can always think of
an exam i remember i we talked about
alcohol at a seminar years ago
and i said yeah if you want to be like
the best in the world you probably don't
want to be drinking all the time and of
course somebody chimed up and said like
what about dan green
well you're not dan green okay so fuck
off right it's probably not in your best
interest
and i would i would possibly have green
drinks all the time either well that's
just i just remember somebody saying
that and
you know and i would posit that i don't
know if he does drink or not but i would
pause it if he is drinking all the time
he probably could be even an even better
dan green than if he was not
right so yeah
adam bean is up next that's kind of
does he go by mr bean i sure hope
hair bean bean sign
that the using of the german mr hare is
i
only know in the context of s m porn
exclusively
we went we went down a weird rabbit hole
the last couple weeks in a row with porn
so
adam bean says what are your thoughts on
blood flow restriction training to work
around sports injuries
such as bfr curls for bad elbows or bfr
squats for growing out after pain
so i think it's great it's absolutely
exactly what the doctor ordered for
those types of situations my only caveat
would be that you should really try
to do two things one may be impossible
one is get at the root of what's causing
the problem slash what the diagnosis is
for the injury
and two try to make sure you're doing
something to remediate that injury and
or preventing it from happening again
it's not just something like oh i'm hurt
efr like try to figure out maybe why and
sometimes you can't and sometimes you
just have to do your best but if you're
like yeah man like
the way i do dips seems to fuck up my
elbows but fuck trying to look at a
better technique for dips i'm just gonna
do bfr for
four weeks the elbow pain goes away and
then go back to being an idiot and
causing elbow pain again
so we don't want you guys to use the
bfr's band-aid but insofar as you find
yourself in a position where you cannot
train normally
then bfr is great in the muscles that
it's possible to use it for
some muscles are impossible to do bfr
with sort of killing yourself like
anything in the back the chest the abs
well because you know
figure that one out yeah uh but yeah
that's the deal
yeah i'm really glad you said that
because i think if you are working so
the with the question said to work
around sports injuries right and so
can bfr be used for that sure but it's
much lower on the list than you might
think there's a lot of other
troubleshooting things you should do
before jumping into bfr and most of them
i would say
are somewhere in the realm of modifying
your technique so that you can do
whatever it is pain-free
and or reducing your volume and or
intensity of training for that
particular muscle because
more often than not it's like okay well
this hurts my elbows if i do it this way
well try it this way oh it doesn't hurt
anymore how about that
that's that's i would i would say 80
percent of the time or better
and then the other big chunk of the time
is like well it hurts when i do 195.
well why don't you do
170 for more reps and see how that goes
oh that doesn't hurt
okay well there you go boom that's a
pretty quick easy fix so a lot of times
things like volume and intensity
and of course exercise technique are the
big mediators
and then also looking back at what you
have been doing previously and saying am
i hitting
you know my mrvs prematurely based on
these progressions that i'm making and
certain things
and then once you kind of go through
some of these more fundamental things
then you can say
i can look at something like bfr to me
you can use bfr as a workaround for kind
of sports injuries but it's i think it's
most
potent use is when you have a more
debilitating injury like let's say you
had like an acute knee injury or
something and you don't want to lose
size
that's where it becomes increasingly
useful if you're just like oh i'm having
some knee pain
yeah bfr is okay um but it's more like
oh i had surgery on my knee and i don't
want
i don't want to have one buff leg and
one tiny leg and then that's where bfr
really shines through is a useful tool
yeah great way to put it
next up is bradley hobbs right next to
it easy
he says hey docs if i'm in the middle of
dieting and i know that i'm going to
have a big meal for a special occasion
or want to offset that meal with some
cardio that day are there any
considerations for cardio to be before
after the meal
yes yes there are biggest advice here at
rp
is do not do this kind of stuff i'm glad
you went that glad you went there i was
like yeah
wait a minute yeah so
why why is this why is this the the
recommendation that you don't do it oh
because
it sets you down an interesting
psychological path
of sort of considering food is bad and
cardio is good
and one makes up for the other and
it also puts you up into a real nasty
situation
where the amount of excess calories
you're going to have in a big meal is
probably bordering on
you know a real good big meal and it's
probably going to put you over normal
calories like a tune of a thousand to
2000
in one meal i mean you actually can't do
that much cardio without
incurring an unbelievable amount of
fatigue if you're going to do this i
would say doing it before the meal
taking a shower going to special
occasion and eating is probably your
best bet
after you're going to feel sluggish and
like shit and
and all this other stuff but i would
just not do it at all what i would do is
if you're going to have a big meal for a
special occasion you should know that in
advance
and you just have the big meal and
change nothing else and then just get
back right to your diet as normal
and then with your usual weekly
adjustments yeah you know
you're you may have to make some
adjustments down the road in the diet
you may have to make no adjustments
whatsoever
so um it's it's not something we would
get into in the rp clients group on
facebook which you guys are welcome to
join if you pass a series of i'm not a
robot or a troll tests
that you know we people ask us really
regularly and we always say it's not a
good idea all of our
p coaches are on the same page of not
making up
um you know cardio for eating it's
really starts to get into that
i think it's not necessarily a sign of
disordered eating but it is a behavior
which really checks the
red box of this is not great um
and then because then you know here's
just an example of how that psychologist
starts to open up
uh you start to say okay well if i could
just burn this off i can eat whatever i
want
and then you end up you know out with
friends the next day or two days later
and you're like
i can have a few twinkies i'll just do
more cardio and that sets up in a
situation which
you're trying to do so much cardio that
it fatigues you like shit and all the
salt and water stuff of the food still
waves your body weight around and it
really just interferes with things
um so i would say if you want a special
meal it should be worth it
as dr melissa davis says all the time
and then
then you should just take take it
replace a normal meal in your plan
with that meal and then the next day
just get right back
to the dive so that's that james
yeah yeah really good i'm glad you went
there i thought you were going to get
into like the nitty-gritty of before
versus after
so i was like caught me off guard that
you went there because i was thinking
the same thing
um actually dr mal has um i've i can't
i wish i could tell you exact explicitly
which podcast but if you look at some of
the most recent
podcast dr mel has been on she has some
really interesting points about
making that decision and things you can
do and strategies where you can
sit on it for a minute think about what
you want to get out of whether it's a
cheat meal or a big meal coming up and
weigh the pros and cons and come back to
this idea later on and see if it's still
worth it to you
and i thought that was really
interesting and compelling and it's just
a
way of reframing it in your mind to say
like is this trade-off
what i want it to be and if it is then
you go for it and everything's good but
if it's not then you might reevaluate
whether or not
it's something that you wanted to do in
the first place but i think as dr mike
said
punishing yourself for having a
trade-off like that just goes down a
dark path because then you can
imagine you're imagine having that meal
and then saying like okay i told myself
i was going to do the cardio afterwards
right and so then you're on that you're
on the treadmill
or you're walking around the
neighborhood basically like you know
flailing
fl flailing yourself doing the cardio
like i'm a bad boy i got to work this
off i did a bad
thing you know it's just silly so don't
do that i
if you have i have had clients in the
past
who i trust and i know that they can
make good decisions and good trade-offs
and sometimes we'll say yeah you can
have a little bit less food in the day
to try and you know balance out the
calories but for most people
um i wouldn't do that at all just say
have the meal enjoy yourself don't think
about it and then pick up where you left
off the next day
yep all right
next up is julie menken
julie got it
she asks what is your advice for
training on vacation i'm working through
the rp female physique temple in the
third week of the second meso
i'll be going to vegas oh shit uh-oh i
plan to train at dragons later
before play time go get you uh sounds
good
dragon's lair is 30 per day pass so just
know that advance
um i'd like to have a fun trying machine
slash movements that i don't normally
get to experience while i'm there
what is the best way to do this and
still somewhat stick to my training plan
should i say fuck it and trade it like a
deal a week where i train
and do whatever uh thanks for all you do
docs well i would say a deal of week is
not doing whatever
because de-load week means you
purposefully reduce your difficulty of
training
but uh can you have fun doing machines
and movements that you don't normally
get to experience
absolutely here's what you do you stick
roughly to your training plan of muscle
groups
so for example you have two chest
exercises and a tricep exercise that
work out
you just pick two function exercises
you've never done and make sure to hit
roughly the rep range target that you're
doing before
and hit the reps in reserve that your
goal is for that workout
and then that's it and then just pick a
tricep exercise that you think is fun
do the same thing hit the rep range hit
the rir and then
that's great and then you can just uh
when you get back go on to your next
week and maybe probably repeat week
three again
but with your old exercises and keep the
train plugging along so i would say
that's probably
uh your best bet and i would say also if
you have anything heavy
uh requires you know sets of five to ten
a lot of stability
um then i would say don't try to
replicate that
stay north of 10 reps mostly on vacation
because you know like
flying a plane actually does really
interesting things to your lower back
not necessarily bad things but things
that put in a mild state of disarray
for a few hours or even sometimes a few
days sleeping in hotel
um beds can be different than your
normal bed it can leave your lower back
a little iffy can with your shoulders a
little iffy
and i find that when i'm traveling um
there's also some you know dehydration
body water stuff you know you drink a
couple coffees and a couple beers on the
plane
and not that you say you get there that
day and start training but in any case
you know
vacation tends to throw you off so i
would say it's just not worth it
to train in the 5 to 10 rep range on
vacation and i would say go
10 reps or more um that's the
modifications that i would do
james you guys hear dr mike's double
fist in coffee and beer on his on his
flights i got to stay awake enough to me
that's right yeah i i very much agree
with what dr mike said and so usually in
these situations
a little foresight goes a long way in
that
ideally you might plan these vacations
during what would be your d
your deloading period anyway or you try
and shift your training around so that
it would fall
your vacation would fall on your deload
or in this case since you are going to
maybe explore some fun options that you
haven't done before
pairing your vacation with an active
rest period is is
highly recommended i've heard dr mike
talk about that many many times at
seminars and on webinars and stuff and
so
that would be my recommendation where
maybe you want to stick to
your your fpt regimen and and the
recommendations dr mike gave i think is
spot on
i would say another good option would
just be do active rest during that
vacation time and then just play around
with it as you see fit and have a good
time and don't fuss
too much because it's your vacation you
don't want to spend your whole vacation
fussing over gym and diet stuff
next up is jason b what a b
got it he says my office is built within
my home gym
as a result my training session may
extend over several hours due to
meetings and actual work
while not efficient there are there any
downsides to having inconsistent rest
times between working sets
or excessive rest times of 30 plus
minutes if i pulled off i do warm up
again to prevent injury
but if i need to do four working sets
can i do two
rest an hour up again do the other two
and still make gains as if i did four
in a row so i'll take my shot at this
and then james will play cleanup because
actually he's an expert in this
i would say um downside of having an
inconsistent rest time between your
working sets
is that your ability to track progress
is going to be degraded
not eliminated but degraded so you just
have to try to target your irs real well
and shoot for fpr's
and really give yourself two workouts or
even two weeks
of not being able to match reps to
before you conclude that you're actually
overreached because sometimes you'll
just have had
20 minutes one day and 30 seconds
another day and of course that 20 minute
rest is gonna be more
or it's gonna be five minutes one day 20
minutes another day and the five minutes
will be more because you're still warmed
up
the 20 minutes one you might have to do
a little mini warm-ups that hit it again
or should throw you off
so it's going to cause some attractive
problems nothing crazy but something
just to pay attention to
um if you cool off definitely warm up
again uh
and uh let's see can you still make
gains if you did all four in a row i
think in most cases you can make very
similar gains
there are problems where you're not able
to summate a lot of local fatigue and
your mind muscle connection may suffer
as a result
metabolite accumulation may suffer as a
result um stimulus to fatigue ratio may
suffer to some extent
uh and uh so like you know for example
if you have a muscle group that responds
a lot to higher ups pump and burn let's
say biceps or something
g whiz you know taking 10 minutes here
and there of rest is just not going to
provide the same stimulus as
a more condensed training but
in other cases if you're a real fast
twitch person you know
you can do a stuff like a deadlift and
do 120 minutes later and actually a
better performance
and since you don't care because you're
working the entire time might be good
for you
so it's a mixed bag uh it's not the end
of the world just make sure you're
staying safe by warming up well
um and i would say try to cluster your
training especially from perspective of
daily sort of undulations and stress
exposure and recovery
state i would say try to condense your
workout into as short a time as you can
reasonably do
i wouldn't train the entire day on and
off um because that can summate actually
disproportionate amount of systemic
fatigue
because there's no consistent uh time
to actually have downtime a similar
analogy is uh with sleep
and if you get consistent eight hours
it's actually qualitatively better
than getting the same eight hours one
hour at a time and then being awake for
two hours one hour at a time
there are certain states your body likes
to once it gets into especially with
recovery and adaptation
it likes to stay in for a long time and
it only benefits if it stays in for a
long time
so that's that's kind of the deal james
yeah absolutely and that that last
example was very apt i mean
think about like trying to sustain that
sympathetic output versus going into
like your parasympathetic recovery
mode there's some some major trade-offs
probably in the long term maybe not in
the short term
so i found myself doing this a lot when
i was the weight room manager at etsu
because i was literally in the weight
room and teams were coming in and out i
was trying to do my work
you know phd stuff and dabbling with rp
at the time
and what i find when in these kind of
things is that you get a whole lot of
nothing done
you get very good at just kind of biding
your time
doing half-ass job at a couple things so
and i'm not saying that's you know
you're you're doing a bad job here jason
but this was my experience and what i
found for me what was really helpful and
i still do this now because i'm also a
home gym person
is to as mike said consolidate your
exercises down into the shortest period
possible so for you
that might mean is actually just doing
am pm sessions for the day where you
might actually say okay
i got two or three lifts i'm gonna get
to uninterrupted focused and i might
even set a rest timer for myself where i
just say okay
you know what i'm doing bench or i'm
doing squats but three minutes
period no discussion and if i want to go
faster fine but three is my top end and
that's going to be my a session i'm
going to get through it focused and if i
have to take a break
then i'm going to switch to work mode
and i'm going to sit and i'm going to do
my work i'm going to do my best job that
i can
and then if i have more stuff i'll do a
pm session later in the day and i'll do
the same thing where i'll say okay
i got you know maybe calves or arms or
shoulders or whatever i got my my pm
stuff
i'm going to set a timer for two minutes
i'm going to get through all that
focused attention
and then i'm done and then that's done
i'm not coming back to it the rest of
the day then i move on to whatever else
i got going on
so my recommendation in this case would
be to as mike said consolidate your
exercise a little bit
and in your case since you do have the
luxury of a home gym that might
mean using am and pm sessions instead of
having like marathon sessions
and that way you can focus on what
you're doing and then you can also focus
on your work more distinctly which
for me was always really helpful so that
would be the way i would start to think
about it
very cool and and i know sometimes
people might think like why don't wanna
like
do three-minute rest for squats yeah it
sucks but you can take 30 minutes in
between sets and like i said get a whole
lot of nothing done the whole time
whereas if you take three minutes you
can bang out like four sets of squats
maybe it's not your best performances
ever but it's still a robust stimulus
and it's
probably better long term than farting
around yeah
all right abazur zaheed
whoa i'm just gonna type a b
abraham lincoln a b i z e r
a b i
there we go oh he's got a kitty on the
thumbnail
he says should you go to failure on
smaller muscle groups
biceps side belts uh triceps etc every
session in your messy cycle
or should you stick to three two one our
progression across your motorcycles with
other bigger muscle groups uh i would
say that
mostly the answer is to stick to the
progression because
i'll put it this way the question
that has to be answered isn't why isn't
training a failure all the time a good
idea
the question that has to be answered is
why should you go to failure all the
time
and if your answer is because i can and
it doesn't cause a lot of fatigue
then the next question is what is it
benefiting you and the answer is
probably not
then it probably does cause marginally
more fatigue especially as you get
really big and really strong
for me i'm actually doing a pm session
right after this i'm going to do bicep
curls and laterals
except i'm bi curling on the cables
one notch away from the full stack which
takes like a lot of arousal and it's
fucking hard
it's like 160 pounds or something stupid
and it fucking beats me up and it's maya
reps too it fucking annihilates me
if i had to go too true failure every
single time jesus christ would be the
fuck a lot of fatigue
now that may not be the case for you if
you're not as big and not as strong yet
i'm sure he will be with time
and you will be with time you will
discover that the going to failure thing
all the time doesn't work that well
we can actually extend this practice to
everything even compound movements you
get 110 pound female
she can grind squats to failure four
times a week and be 100 fine
two years later she can do it two times
a week and then if she doesn't force she
shuts the bed
two years after that she needs to go to
three two one rir training
and you say well why not just start with
three two one our uh three two one rar
progression training from the beginning
what are the downsides of that
well there are no downsides to that it's
just really good training uh and
especially for beginners especially
people aren't that strong
it's been very very conclusively shown
that even three reps away from failure
gives you
very close to the same results
possibly slightly better results than
going to failure all the time
at least equivalent results and almost
certainly with less fatigue and less
chance of technical disruption and
injury and all those other things
so yeah people i've had this discussion
with several people several people who i
actually
respect considerably if you look for
this somewhere on youtube jeff nippard
interviewed me about this he's
interviewed me a few times
and he's like well can we go to failure
on you know isolations and i was like
jeff why do you want to go to failure so
god damn much he's like ah
i don't know it's ah so if you want to
go to failure
certainly doing on smaller muscle groups
is the least
damaging way to do it it's a this is an
extreme analogy i don't really mean this
but you know if you wanted to shoot off
a part of your body
you know i'd sure pick the pinky toe
over the fucking dick or the whole leg
right that doesn't mean it's a good idea
to shoot off your pinky toe not the
train of failures that bad
but relatively speaking it's like it's
it's kind of nuts you know
there's again if someone demonstrates
real concrete
comprehensive evidence or logical
reasoning that failure training has
these real big benefits
james and i will start going to failure
all the time there's 99 problems james
and i
uh have not one of them that's trying
very hard trying very hard it's not that
hard
it's actually a direct quote from
charlie john who just won his first
bodybuilding show
uh overall this past weekend training
hard's not that hard
training smart's pretty hard and smart
and hard at the same time is really hard
uh but you know if you want to go to
failure suite it's just by no means
clear if there's anything there for you
unless it happens on occasion and mostly
you're close to it james
yeah and to to that end if you're
feeling like your biceps you know delts
or whatever are not getting a sufficient
stimulus like go ahead and just add sets
at that point like what's wrong with
that we know that adding
you know effective sets is probably a
really good idea
so if you're going through your training
and you're feeling like
you're leaving something on the table
with some of those smaller muscle groups
we'll just do more
you don't have to make it harder
necessarily by going to failure you can
probably get more growth stimulus if you
are
just adding more sets because you're
probably they're probably being under
stimulated and it's
not necessarily an rir issue
yeah all right next up
is tripp simon one word
trip got it
james do you remember back from the
clinton era linda tripp
i do i do she was involved in that whole
scandal i don't remember how though i
believe she was the one
if memory serves that sort of took
monica lewinsky's testimony so to speak
at first and was like you really should
sue somebody about this
uh or whatever like you really should
should come out with this and i think
she was kind of the one
maybe i don't know oh fuck man i'll just
google it real quick cause it's just
gonna bother me linda
tripp american civil servant ooh we can
see what her net worth is
nope that doesn't actually come up
people just googled it it's not
available
uh linda tripp is uh
promote okay to see prominent role in
the clinton whiskey scandal trips action
and secretly recording monica lewinsky's
continental phone calls jesus christ
that's a golf
bitch be tripping selfie legal that's
why they're caught tripping
right exactly literally invented it for
her snitch asshole
calls about a relationship with
president bill clinton caused a
sensation with their links to earlier
clinton versus jones lawsuit blah blah
tripp claimed that her
motors were purely patriotic she was
able to avoid a wiretap charge in
exchange for handing in the tapes
she then claimed her firing from the
pentagon at the end of the clinton
administration was vindictive
while the administration called it
standard procedure for political
appointee
in 2004 tripp and her husband dieta
dieta rausch
owned and ran a year-round holiday store
called the christmas lady in middleburg
virginia that's a that's a 180
of uh you know used to be like literally
exposing the president's fucking
indiscretions and now you're on a
fucking christmas store
that's wild that's a great where are
they now story
it's insane that's probably hard to beat
uh it's one of those like if you made a
movie about it people would be like
this is stupid and you google it like
what it's real
let me guys end up in like florida or
something you know
um middleburg virginia
middleton virginia is one of those
states that has terrible town names
if you guys have ever driven through
virginia it's this is class middleburg
really weird weird chick on it there's a
bunch of weird ones like
ugh i remember driving up because i've
driven up that way so many times there's
like salt town
a bunch of just like stupid ass names
like westville
just you know like you're like what just
ran out of ideas ran out of ideas come
on
there's a city in maybe michigan
called azuza which just means
a to z usa sweet
yeah who did that who knows
all right so like in the midwest they
just use like tree names a lot worse yes
like you know
oakhurst yeah pineville
yeah like elmberg i grew up in oak park
michigan there you go no
where did you grow up james what was it
called glen ellen glenn ellen yeah i
mean yeah
like i was in chicago and then glen
ellen for a while in chicago again yeah
all over
chicago also has an oak park yes yeah
that's where carter's from
mm-hmm it's trippy and it's like
geographically in the same place that
oak park to detroit is
that's weird that's that's strange all
right
sorry bless you
tripp simon says hey docs thank you for
all the great content lately has really
helped me as a new trainer molly that's
our country
questions as the sets go by i become
more fatigued and can no longer hit my
target reps with
my target rar do i do less reps in a set
to still feel like i'm at my target rar
yes or push harder to maintain my reps
no no you shouldn't do that uh is he
talking just within like the session or
are we too weak
i think within that i'm going to say
within the session
because a lot of times we get this
question of like should i
match reps even if it violates the rir
that i'm targeting this week
that's kind of what i'm wondering or if
he just means like
well so let's answer it both ways yeah
if you have a target rir
oh he he says hit my target reps
so target reps means he's trying to
match reps right that's right because
there's
but for target reps if he means target
rep range the answer is anything north
of
largely anything north of five reps is
fine it's like if you have a third set
this week you didn't last week so
there's not nothing to match
but you want to hit you know you know
you want to hit 10 plus reps but you hit
seven
it's fine however if last week you hit
seven
and this week you have to increase your
rer
or decrease it too much to hit six yes
actually you should just try to hit six
because you know the first week is three
irish and then all the other ones you
match
match or beat now if you're beating them
beat them only to the rar that's the
target of that week
but if you're matching them and this is
in our video match or beat wrap
progression system that's on youtube
if you match them then
you know you have to match the rir or an
rr that's lower
potentially because you know you have to
push to get those reps
if you didn't try to match the reps you
would do fewer reps and we would
consider that an under performance
and then if you repeated that in the
next workout or the next week that's the
sign you're hitting your mrv
so yeah you kind of have to match and if
it's like well it's supposed to be a two
r
but i you know i supposed to hit six or
two ir but i end up hitting
six but i had to go zero ir what what do
i do about that
well the answer is you're not adapting
as quickly as possible and or fatigue is
rising too quickly
and that's okay maybe next week you'll
do better and it'll be fine and maybe it
was a false alarm should happen
sometimes you're tired
but if the next week or the next session
for that muscle group you also fail to
match
well two in a row is really uh our kind
of rule free probably bumping into mrv
and you probably need some kind of
recovery
uh session or half week or whole deload
in order to address the problem
did you just mean mug grandma uh
not grandma but mel's mom and we all
know she has it coming
um weird melon walked into somewhere
where she doesn't belong
um threw me off too fuck oh
sorry let me read the rest of his shit
really quick and make sure we're not
misunderstanding him
he goes if we know that one fresh i'm
able to perform 12 reps or something and
be at
where i are but then by set three i'm
performing nine reps because that feels
like my new two rar
but i'm actually now five reps away from
a maximum which isn't even thought to be
hypertrophic so
it's the hypotropic stuff that's not
based on maximum that's based on per set
like three sets to failure or three sets
at three rer
i wouldn't is every set is a new
organism and you judge
independent rer within the set it is
based on how far you could have pushed
that set two r is two reps shy of that
not like how much you were fresh because
then all the workouts would last like
three sets because all of a sudden you'd
be so tired that it wouldn't make any
fucking sense
so he says do we judge rar from new
fatigue points of reference yes
and or last week or always measure
against the muscle's absolute
performance in a well-rested state we
never measure
in a muscle's absolute performance in a
well-rested state outside of the first
set
uh so actually actually much easier to
answer than we thought
james yeah and so um sometimes this gets
a little muddy
for some exercises where um the like
absolute
jump in intensity so like i ran into a
thing
and you think i would have this down by
now right but even for me sometimes this
comes up
i was doing dumbbell chest flies and i
was doing it with the 30s and the jump
to 35
was was enough where it really dropped
my reps
significantly right does that mean that
i'm underperforming
no but it does mean like okay now it's
harder for me to track what i'm doing
because my reps dropped so much and so
what i ended up doing
was i was like week two i did 30s
that was like normal so i then i gave
myself a programmed bump in intensity
because i hadn't bumped it for a minute
so i went up to the 35s and week three
then it was like oh okay went from like
doing 15 to like
nine or something i was like that sucks
so then the last week i went back to the
30s and just did more reps at that point
because it was just easier to keep track
of because sometimes
increasing the intensity with like
dumbbells or certain kinds of machines
that next increment up is just it's just
hard to to keep track of
yeah and then you have to just treat
that as kind of a new wave of tracking
and the next workout you can see if you
beat that previous one and so on and so
forth
yeah and so then the next one i'm going
to start at the 35s and just do that one
all the way through and then i'll know
like okay i only got nine but i started
at nine and that's fine perfect
perfect samuel turner
who in my screen is just right down from
that
oh god
samuel turner says alpha destiny sat on
his ig
q a that steroid users can train 8rir
and still make their best gains
is it true that effective rer is much
higher than naturals
and how you train doesn't matter when
you take pds
so i say there's a grain of truth to
that and that grain of truth is that
steroid users uh so in this case we have
to be very specific
people that were natural three months
ago and now are on
a decent amount of gear same training
state same age same body weight etc
they can do higher rirs like r's of you
know five or six or whatever
and still make the same gains they did
when they were doing
one or two rar as drug uh non-using
individuals as
natural individuals right so because
steroids have their own
independent and dependent mechanisms for
growth
you can work easier and get the same
gains as natural now here's the really
interesting thing
who the fuck takes steroids to get the
same gains as a natural that's insane
you take steroids to get better gains so
the way you get better gains is you
train just as hard as you were natural
in fact you could probably tolerate more
volume and more frequency
uh and get even better results every
piece of data we have
uh in any way data anecdotal included
for people who actually use steroids
alpha destiny i don't believe has
ever used to say is natural maybe still
does i have no reason to believe he's a
steroid user
um you know everything we know uh
on our end of the the uh the pool here
is that you know uh steroids don't
really change much about optimal
training
outside of the fact that you may
potentially be able to do less and get
really good results and or more and get
really good results
but as far as ri are there's no reason
to believe that there's any any
difference at all so
the the error in in his statement i
think is
that when he said still make their best
gains i'm not sure he said that maybe
there's some loss something lost in
translation
be sure as hell don't make your best
gains as a steroid user training eight
rar
uh you would make better gains training
at six and then training at four and
probably training at two and make your
best gains at roughly two which is where
everyone makes the best gains
or more or less so no that's that's not
true
but you can get similar gains to
naturals training much easier
uh but if you take steroids it's
probably worth training hard because
you're destroying your health
uh and fucking with your psychology for
ostensibly a pretty good reason you
might as well do everything else right
it's kind of like getting a race car and
putting you know like even worse fuel
into it you're like well it's still
going to be faster like yeah okay
hey that ideally you get a race car to
go really fast not just faster than a
regular car as
fast with shitty your fuel uh and this
question is true that effective r is
much higher than naturals
we have no reason to believe that's the
case um and how you train doesn't matter
when you take pds is just
just blatant batshit idiocy i don't i
don't mean to say that
alpha destiny uh is an idiot or thinks
that um
and i don't mean samuel turner that you
think that i have other i heard other
people say that it doesn't matter how
you train you take pds
those people almost never take pds
they're just like butt hurt naturals
that are fucking tiny and just mean
excuse
um and they see a lot of fucking
retarded ass drug you drug use
motherfuckers
uh train dumb as shit and make great
gains just because they have great
genetics and they take a lot of gear
but given your gen x given your gear if
you train more intelligently you will
make better gains
on steroids or off steroids it's the
same it's just like it's just playing
field just goes like this and then all
the same principles pretty much apply
so uh the thing is is that a lot of guys
who train stupid or
gear they make great gains until they
get hurt or they don't make great gains
there's
tons of guys so so listen like what
happened
not not to call out anybody here but
like you know i'm not gonna name a name
but
bodybuilders still have weak muscle
groups like oh fuck it he's retired
marcus roll
his triceps always sucked it look like
if you could just take pd's and it
didn't matter how i trained
what the fuck happened to marcus's
world's triceps how come they're not big
like
i assure you he was taking enough pds
the legends if any of them were only
true is that he took an inordinate
amount of pd's and he was actually
pretty open about it
so how the fuck um is triceps didn't
grow well there's the genetic cap there
that just prevented it from doing that
and you know he trained probably pretty
smart about it and tried his fucking
best and if
he trained his triceps like every other
person they would have been really
fucking small but he talked about his
career he prioritized them
trying to figure out what worked well
for them they got hurt repeatedly
because they were associated recovery
and it's just a shitty body part but no
it's not about my mind that his attempts
to be an intelligent trainee for triceps
absolutely increased tricep size for him
and and that's the case and also like it
doesn't matter um how you train when you
take
pd's well how come everyone's not 350.
you know like big romney's about 290 on
stage what's preventing them from being
330 is really more peds no
there's all kinds of other factors it's
like saying it doesn't matter how you
eat when you take pd's which guys do
fucking say by the way
i heard you fucking take trend you could
just eat pizza and be lean like yeah it
depends on how lean and how much your
liver values want to get destroyed and
your blood pressure up
but yeah like make taking trend will
make you leaner but if you add to that a
really really good diet and a really
intelligent training lots of cardio then
you get competition lean
that can you be like regular lean guy
lean and by destroying yourself
then then yeah sure trend helps but it's
not it doesn't erase anything it just
elevates the playing field
okay feel free feel free to see all
right
yeah um once uh so let me chime in and
then i'm gonna do something real quick
and i'm sorry
about this guys just have like grandma
madness right now um yeah so what's
really funny on this one is like the uh
eight rar like how do you even train at
eight rar why if somebody was like all
right james your program is you're gonna
do bench press
at eight rar be like can i just go play
video games this is stupid
who why am i here this is nothing um so
yeah
i agree with all the points dr mike made
there um
and again like if your goal is to train
at 8rir
just go do something else like why are
you training it's just a waste of time
right like the the reference point of
using rer is
failure the further away you get from
that the more difficult it is going to
be to gauge so i don't even think i
could gauge
8r correctly more often than not and i
think about this probably more than most
people so
that just seems like a silly thing like
what's i don't even understand the
motivation behind
that methodology really even the
question like is that what you want to
do
do you want to just do easy training and
take lots of steroids like
the only reason i train like hard is
because i want to so you know what i
mean this seems odd i just can't relate
to that
all right if i'll be two seconds folks
sorry i just have like family madness
i'll be right back
i'll just stay put yeah or if you want
to move on i'll i'll just jump back in
wherever
whatever you want to do dr mike joke
show
or yeah i'll be right like i'm just
literally just going to go to a
you know i hate to be put on a spot like
this just kidding i have no problem with
whatsapp
um let's see if i can answer any
questions that are off the record here
that we didn't uh
answer apex k says when is the mustache
coming back
i don't know who had a mustache
interesting question let's see
finding it repeats has thoughts on how
big lenny should train
no fucking clue who big lenny is what
disaster this idea was huh
uh let's see who else has a short
question i can get to
um
regarding jordan lomborg i recommend
that everyone including mike and james
read
massimo pigliucci's i was always a fan
of his name that's a fucking incredible
name if he grew up in america he would
be in real deep shit as a kindergartner
all the way through
possibly high school uh
nonsense on stilts how to tell science
from bunk especially chapter where he
examines bjorn lomborg and al's
claims on climate change i actually have
no idea where he sits in that regard
sometimes it's unfortunately the nasty
tendency in the skeptic community
and this is really exemplified quite
well with
um rational wiki website
is that sometimes skeptics mistake their
skepticism or
their radical leftism for skepticism uh
and then they just just go off on
nonsense all the time
so uh i'll get back to you guys maybe
never about what i think about that in
any case all right james is back
james might kill someone it might happen
i see grandma time is doing you very
well yes
i love when people take your keys and
say is this key the right key and you go
no and then they just leave is that
mel's mom
no but
family time is great
that's great all right
o z c a r
o z c a r os car
yeah it's a pretty sweet latest day
oscar
is it possible to have reached mrv in a
given muscle group without feeling sore
oh absolutely
folks mrv is really easy to define it's
the maximum volume you can recover from
in any sequence of periods of time as
defined by the individual
so your mrv within a week is that like
next week can you do the same thing
again
can you have the same performance you
can feel great you can feel like shit
you can feel anything in between
if you fail to match the performance
from last week there's a really good
chance you've exceeded maximum recurrent
loan
if you succeed in outperforming yourself
you're probably not an mrv right so an
uh
sort of the opposite of this question or
a sense of corollary
is is it possible to be getting really
crazy sore all the time
and not have hit mrv fuck yeah like
you're really crazy sword sometimes
you're still sore and you come in and
you hit a pr
uh are you at your maximum recoverable
volume no clearly not because
you still more than recover you can
adapt but if you are failing to recover
your strength over and over
in a sequence of time days or weeks
however you measure usually measure it
by week
if there's a sequence of weeks in which
you're getting declining performances
uh then you never have to get sore at
all uh you could just have this like
just feeling a fatigue you could have no
feeling at all you still manage not to
hit mrv
mrv is real simple it's awesome it's
mathematical
super fucking easy to measure one of the
reasons many reasons why i really like
it
because a lot of times before james and
i sort of stepped on the scene and
coined those
landmarks people would gauge like what's
training too much
it was just all those by the way is
addressed in our book how much should i
train to an extensive amount our
frustration was people you know and
asked like hey
how do i know if i'm training too much
and people have this sort of like weird
smorgasbord of heuristics like oh sore
really tired and james and i have come
from a tradition of hypertrophy and
strength training james rugby training
and wrestling
we were always like soaring time
motherfucker that's how you feel just
normal sport training what the fuck are
you talking about like if we were just
to check those boxes we'd never fucking
train hard
and some people we were around which
would go unmentioned were like super
paranoid about high fatigue and anytime
anyone felt remotely sore or tired they
would be like ah that's too much deload
and it's like no motherfucker we need
objective ways to figure out if we're
actually so retired we
looked at the definition of recovery
physically in a textbook recovery is
when you're able to repeat past
performances
and we're like okay failure to recovery
means you've exited your maximum
recoverable volume and maybe doing too
much volume
so that's it yeah so you absolutely can
feel
any way possible but if you repeatedly
fail to match your prior performance
then you're probably in
accession of mrv james yeah it's funny
as most of you have kind of heard the
stories about how we kind of
came about with the volume landmarks but
you know mike and i always kind of came
from it from a
sporting perspective of like okay we
want to make sure people aren't training
too much because the assumption it was
always that they were training pretty
hard
and then what we find in the kind of the
real world is that most people aren't
training hard enough
for all those reasons because they
weren't really sure where
to draw the line am i a little bit sore
here am i i'm not feeling my best today
well it's like you're not supposed to
feel your best that's okay you just keep
going keep training hard
and what we find is that uh most people
who
are kind of flirting with that idea are
generally wildly under training which is
kind of hilarious from our perspective
because we were always worried about
people
on the other end of the spectrum but
yeah you can absolutely uh be
overreached in any given muscle
without any like glaring soreness or
even
sense that you're there in some cases
one of the classic ways
is uh when you see here's here's like a
classic thing that happens to people
myself included
you are a four-in-one kind of person
and you get to that fifth week and
you're like yeah you know i don't know
man maybe like maybe i can get in the
gym maybe i could do a fifth week here
normally i'm a four in one kind of guy
but maybe
i'll try a five in one and see if i can
make it through and you get under that
that bar for a bench or a squat and then
the first couple warm-up sets you're
like
absolutely not no i thought i could
train this week but as soon as i like
tried to do anything
not happening and it wasn't because you
were like sore you just have nothing
just like you can just tell there's no
push there's no um sometimes you can
even get like
fasciculations and just like in other
indices that like yeah this is just not
gonna happen
even though you're not really feeling it
you know superficially so
yeah you can as mike said you can be in
any state and have potentially breached
mrv
boom boom
i actually had that go in my favor this
week i was uh i did i was like i said
normally i'm a four in one and this week
i was like oh okay well you want to try
it i had that
that that mrv problem where i was
looking at my numbers from last week
and i was like well i either increase in
weight or reps on everything it's pretty
hard to say that i
i need to deload so i might as well go
in and try and sure enough like went in
and i still got it so we're still
training five and one here
okay auto regulate that shit that's
awesome yeah
um that's another reason why james and i
are huge
fans of like every all training has to
be a three to one paradigm
what if after every three increases
you're fucking golden
you could probably keep going you know
keep going why not
all right vasil jillaiff
he's actually number 11 but is a very
good question
got it great great level of depth so i
want to answer it
um he says hey doc i have a question
concerning overreaching
in mid week three out of a total of of
five or four
mostly four i start to experience the
symptoms i guess you can call them
suddenly failing and falling and staying
asleep isn't as easy
i feel more tired during the day and
sometimes i have to battle myself not to
fall asleep at random times
performance is still increasing week to
week can these symptoms be bypassed or
mitigated somehow
i love going from everything to mrv when
i'm dead set on the style of imperfect
training so changing methods like going
to helm's
static style volume progression is not a
choice okay
uh furthermore when this starts to
happen i start to supplement with
magnesium and i've tried melatonin but
it only gives me the side effects
thanks um so this actually really i
didn't wasn't planning on this but this
dovetails really well
with our question uh from last time or
just the last question we answered
which is like okay so let's see what
your problems are uh staying asleep
isn't as easy
noted feeling more tired during the day
noted battling south not to fall asleep
random times noted
uh performance is still increasing week
to week well so here's the deal man
that's just a part of the training
process
like can you imagine talking to the
wrestlers right now
like let's say on the united states
wrestling team which is probably gonna
as a team win the olympics this year um
can you imagine talking to them right
now they're preparing for tokyo and
they're like how you fellas feeling
they're like great this is easy
gee whiz mister they're 50s kid
wrestlers wrestling's fun
right they're in the fucking grind bro
they're having trouble staying fucking
alive
but as long as your performance is good
that's just part of being an athlete
so you know can you do something to to
to make this better yes
try to sleep longer on average from the
beginning so the fatigue doesn't
accumulate as much
another one is try to make sure
nutrition is really spot-on otherwise
try to you know
relax psychologically and all these
other modalities describe the recovery
book
a big one is to reduce your total volume
of training so that your systemic
fatigue is lower by prioritizing some
body parts and deprioritizing others
but when you train hard even on priority
you're going to realize that the kind of
stuff still hits you and as long as your
performance is still improving or stable
you're still getting hypertrophic
benefits so i'll tell you what like
if halfway through or as you describe it
halfway or to the latter half
of your plan shit sort of starts to get
hard
motherfucker welcome to training it's
just a normal part of training do your
best to mitigate it by recovering better
and so on and so forth
then you can potentially train less but
that'll still happen because
if you train less you end up training
harder for whatever you are training uh
because you have more energy and the
sooner or later you run out of energy
uh and that's that's just how it is and
another situation is
if you know if you really start to feel
like shit
you know a five-week progression start
doing four-week progressions although
as james and i just sort of described if
you're still hitting pr's
uh he says performance is still
increasing week to week man you know
like 99 problems but annotation is not
one of them
so it's just i think this mostly the 90
is 10 on this answer is you can
do all the good things to make the
adjustments and another 10 of this
answer is
maybe you can do a little bit less
training total systemically maybe you
can
deload earlier but i think 80 of the
answer from my uh perspective
is that's just what you signed up for
man our training's supposed to be hard
and it's supposed to kind of fuck you up
uh
james yeah i largely agree the only
thing that throws me off a little bit is
the sleep disturbances which is usually
a sign of overreaching to some degree
so what i would say is you might be kind
of flirting in and out of like systemic
overreaching a little bit and so my
suggestion along with what dr mike said
might be to focus less on rsm style
exercises and more on sfr style
exercises so for those of you who are
not familiar with those terms
instead of going for the big raw
stimulus magnitude like your kind of
your compound basics your bench press
your squats your dead
stuff like that shifting to other
exercises which sometimes they're the
same sometimes they overlap
but shifting to exercises which are less
systemically taxing but still hit the
muscles really really well
and so in some cases just here's a
stupid example but bear with me you'll
see what i'm saying
you might get a really good stimulus
from high bar squats you might also get
a really good stimulus from sissy squats
like
are they comparable if you are checking
all the boxes for mev and rir like yeah
they're pretty comparable in many ways
so
what you might find is you might do some
pre-fatigue sissy squats and then move
into some high bar squats or you might
just
swap out movements that don't have quite
as much systemic fatigue spill over
per the amount of stimulus that you get
right and so to me this looks like
you're having cut you're like
you're flirting at that apocalypse level
of systemic
fatigue and it's affecting you sometimes
but not always
and i would say maybe think about trying
to increase your sfr as much as you can
yep yeah
um those are those are good ideas james
at the same time i think if you have a
higher sfr exercise
you find that it's going real well
you're just going to increase the volume
of it and just end up at the same place
again
you have more benefit but less downside
but the same total magnitude of downside
just more benefit in addition
yeah so yeah uh listen you know nothing
here and and i feel
literally like if you're improving in
your abilities
again as sports scientists we can't
really tell like if you say
should i deload i feel like shit we're
like how's your training like amazing
we're not gonna be like yeah
we're going to be like take a few take a
day off or something eat a lot of food
sleep a lot and try to fucking hit it
again because you're
you're in that gravy zone of fucking hit
pr's and that's what it's all about
the other thing too i would think about
is he says performances is increasing so
when you say that that i
mike and i will generally assume that
means across the board everything seems
to be going up week to week
you might be finding that some things
are increasing really well like okay my
bicep curls have been increasing my
lateral raises and maybe like my shrugs
but some of the other ones maybe your
bench presses or your main quad
movements or whatever
are not you might be stagnating on some
of the more important things and
progressing on some of the
lesser things and you might be painting
a false picture of like overall
progression is going well because you're
progressing on
kind of accessory stuff and not maybe
your main lift so i would say if your
main lifts whatever it is for each
session are not
progressing but other things are seems
like you're you're kind of on that
that overreaching flirting with it a
little bit so
just keep that in mind yep yep
all right i'm looking down sorry this is
uh we don't have to take this but i'm
just looking at this guy
my legs have fucking exploded in size
and i've had to throw away a lot of
trousers
[Laughter]
my man you're doing something right
okay i will say i'm going to start to
load these better because i just got all
the way to the bottom
mike had 10 up votes great question
darren hawkins our perennial high
question of voters 12 and the fucking
youtube put them all the way to the
bottom the fuck is going on what
this algorithm is fucking ridiculous uh
in addition to that just a real funny
question that i've just baffled
with james i want your opinion to see if
you have one is
voiced in some shit like that anyway
cyrillic
uh name uh
just above this is i think yeah there
you go
thoughts on greg descent copy striking
gvs
video what the fuck is copyright what is
copy striking
i have no idea what that is
is that like i
have no let's look it up copy striking
it's amazing we have google right
dictionary uh the alternative word for
copy
write strike mainly used by twitch
thoughts
[Laughter]
seriously you said that i'm going to
copy strike this guy
just for okay well what is a copyright
right i still don't know what it is
i i gotta click on them is that when you
you have intellectual property that you
don't get copywritten to stick it to the
man
right hold up uh copyright strike the
dreaded thing
you want to see on your youtube channel
usually your youtube channel gets a
copyright strike by uploading a video
with a copyrighted song or movie in it
oh youtube takes that video down
so i got okay so thoughts on greg just
said copy striking gds's video
oh did gvs make like an antique greg set
video
or something i don't fuck what the fuck
is gbs oh
see these replies g shred shit my bad
this counts about to
take it down what the fuck care about
you
yeah i don't know i literally have no
idea what's going on folks
i i've now i feel like a grandpa again
what
what where's the urban dictionary i
don't know what this is
yeah so i'll just be pretty clear about
this i
i debated gregory set once uh youtube it
was a fucking dumpster fire
uh uh because we had all sorts of
different ideas about what debate means
and then you know that's the extent of
my my drama in the youtube
space excluding one one person who i'll
continue to pick on because he's a
cocksucker
oh he's lying with donald mcdonald i
will continue at my leisure
to fuck with because lyle's a mean
person he's been mean for 20 years
and i'm his avenging angel uh so um
that's it yeah i don't know and i don't
like all the youtube drama of like i
don't even
clearly i didn't know what fuck copy
striking was i don't know g
shred is that the same thing as v shred
this first thing i thought
uh no clue anyway i feed you folks out
there having fun
it's nice uh so we're just going to
continue to stick to our
weekly webinars it's so old yeah
whatever that is older than both what
are these kids talking about
yeah twitch is like twitches when people
like watch you play video games or some
shit right
yeah it's like social media for gamers
that's not my cup of tea
the thing is like no one wants to watch
me play games and i don't really want to
watch other people play for sure
yeah it's mostly just me getting pissed
um
yeah all right well folks that was a fun
q a
thanks for joining us i did see a few
people posted comments to the tune of
you guys should do more q and a's
so we do it twice per month because that
just seems to be a good spot in terms of
the views and exposures it gets we used
to do it every week
and then we found that our questions
would sometimes get kind of repetitive
and then
often the videos wouldn't kind of get
the views that we were hoping for so
that's why we do it we're going to keep
it that way
and then just a reminder for those of
you who are relatively new
if you see questions that you think are
interesting or compelling
please upvote those because those are
the ones we're going to tackle and
unfortunately as mike pointed out
sometimes the algorithm doesn't work
super great but we do our best to find
the ones that have like
the most upvotes usually like you know
10 to 20 of the ones that we look for
right away
and then if you don't find any that were
particularly compelling and you had a
question of your own
go ahead and drop that in and then other
people can do the same thing so upvote
as much as
you can anytime somebody drops a really
thought-provoking or
just unusually good question just ping
hit that like and then we'll tackle it
to the best of our ability
dr mike any housekeeping anything going
on
tons but it's all top secret so i can't
talk about it oh
damn well we'll see if dr james here can
survive grandma madness this week
dude best of luck man yeah it's
something
you had something there what do you got
what do you got what are you hiding back
there don't
you're wagging that finger worry about
things you can't control and grandmas
are definitely in that category
yeah they are they cannot be contained
there it's like um
it's like 28 days later like right just
there it's coming out all right we're
going to wrap this one up folks thanks
for joining us make sure you guys
subscribe there's all sorts of crazy
the one of the ones that caught my eye

the background
