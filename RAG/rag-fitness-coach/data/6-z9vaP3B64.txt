hey folks
dr mike israel here for rpu rp
plus renaissance periodization who am i
not here for that's a really good
question lecture number two
calories and macros for fat loss
what is on the agenda well we're going
to talk about why calories matter
this is kind of important and we're
going to talk about choosing
your calorie levels first from tables
then potentially from equations
and then we're going to talk about body
weight tracking how that might make
those two things a little less important
than some people think
we're also going to talk about the
balance of activity cardio and eating
that can generate a calorie deficit
because it's not really clear if someone
says
hey generate a calorie deficit should
you eat less should you less day or more
daily activity or should you do more
formal exercise who knows we'll figure
that out
and then we'll talk about why protein
matters choosing protein
talk about my carbs matter choosing how
much carb to eat and why fats matter and
choosing how much fat to eat so
let's get right into it with why
calories matter
first point so basically why calories
matter can be phrased as
this in a fat loss diet why do we have
to generate a calorie deficit that is
burning more calories than we consume
if fat loss is our number one goal and
the reality is
point number one just about covers
everything we need to cover points two
and three are really just
sort of uh you know sprinkles on top
if you don't have a caloric deficit
right
if you're eating enough food to attend
to all of your body's needs
why would it burn fat okay fat is your
store in case of emergencies and that
means in case of
a hypo caloric condition that's what
it's there for
is to burn off if it needs to occur
right it's what's a similar analogy
it's like let's say you have like an
auxiliary fuel tank in your
you know 4x4 rover or something like
that and
the auxiliary fuel tank is there to be
tapped into only if the main fuel tank
runs out
and otherwise it just never gets tapped
into and let's say you need to clear out
your auxiliary fuel tank you don't want
to siphon out gas
how do you get the fuel out of there
well if you keep filling up your car
with fuel to its regular fuel tank it'll
never get to the auxiliary fuel tank
because there's no purpose for that
so cutting your calories is not a way to
signal to the body
to burn fat although it's also that and
we'll see that number two
it's literally where fat goes right
there's a deficit that you need this
much energy you're taking in this much
fat gets burned to make up the rest
period if you're getting in this much
energy or you need this much energy and
getting in this much
you're just going to burn this stuff
that you're eating why would your body
burn its stores it doesn't that's
really honest way it happens but if
that's not convincing enough
point number two is that hypocaloric
conditions literally cause intracellular
fat burning pathways to activate
like fat burning is triggered by a
absence of calories or
lack of calories to meet needs you know
that's not a coincidence at all
but the reason evolution has evolved
those mechanisms to start burning fat
when you need it is because of number
one you have to have that need
first right and by the way there are
supplements you can take caffeine for
example that actually trigger fat
burning pathways or fat
releasing pathways to occur even if
you're hyper caloric even if you're iso
caloric you have enough calories
they release fat into the bloodstream so
it can be used by the muscles
and the muscles are like uh actually
we're good we're full and then the fat
just goes
right the hell back into the fat cells
and nothing ever happens with it so the
liberation of fat
is a really great thing that's point
number two the preparation to burn it
but that's useless if you don't have a
deficit because then nothing really
happens
right and then you could say like yeah
well why don't we just burn muscle uh
so it's okay if if we have an iso
caloric condition we
hear our needs here's what we meet so
okay we can't burn a ton of fat but what
if
we build a bunch of muscle and you know
in order for the calories to work out
for the calorie balance to be you know
the muscle building takes calories why
don't we take those calories from
fat so that we're in essence shrinking
our fat stores and expanding our muscles
well that's possible for beginners to do
pretty robustly
early it's not very impressive even in
beginners
in intermediates it really starts to be
very
unlikely and in advance people what's
called recomposition or building muscle
and burning fat at the same time in an
isochloro condition
it's just really uphill and almost never
happens to any meaningful extent like
over a year of training you might be
able to recomp
one pound of fat for one pound of muscle
i don't know about you but people don't
usually start
the fat loss process and say man if this
year i can lose a pound of fat
that would be great that's just not
something people do and forget starting
at 10 years into fat loss process you're
not like man this year
a pound of fat loss would be great so
yeah
recomposition works but it works way way
worse than the hypochlor condition
so if you want your best fat loss
results you got to cut calories
or increase increase activity or some
combination of both period
and if you look at everyone who's lean
who didn't used to be lean they either
reduced their calories or increased
their activity
right almost never did they really just
not change anything
and just grew a bunch of muscle and lost
a bunch of fat that really is highly
unlikely
now calories matter got it so how do we
know how many calories to eat
to generate a beginning of a deficit and
start losing weight well
you can get your calories from tables
right so we've got a table up in front
of you
slide number four where we say okay like
you know let's say moderate training
volume and you weigh 175 pounds and
that's
uh 2785 calories all right and that
these are just iso caloric values
so if we subtract 15 percent we multiply
by 0.85 that number
then we get like a good start for a
hypochlor condition to start losing at a
pretty good
pace um okay that's a way to do it it's
definitely a good way to start
but you'll probably tell like gee you
know these are only 25 pound increments
and like what if you don't weigh 100
pounds or 125 but you weigh like 117
what do you do
it's not super clear and you know the
numbers have pretty big gaps between
them
also this is for average individuals
heights not even taken into account
height has a difference on metabolism
real rough start but it's a fine start
maybe we can do better with equations
and the answer is probably we can
so for example the harris benedict
equation is a pretty decent equation
that determines your basal metabolic
rate
and and that that's a good start right
uh
it can determine your amount of
metabolism it takes to keep you alive
but remember that doesn't factor
physical activity in at all once you get
your basal metabolic rate it's like
what would it take to feed you if you
were in a coma well you're not in a coma
hopefully if you're watching this video
you're almost certainly not in a coma
so maybe we go on to the next slide and
we see that there are physical activity
adjustments here
so for example if you are vigorously
active
you take your harris benedict equation
output and you multiply that by 2.25 and
that gives you how many calories you
might be burning per day and tells you
gives you a real rough estimate if
you're vigorously active now let's find
out real quick
um what are we taking into account with
harris benedict we're talking about
body weight sweet which is exact
bodyweight by the way it's not just a
chart
and height and age that's pretty damn
good but remember
everyone who's the same weight height
and age
does not burn the same number of
calories per day
and notice the lifestyles there's three
of them
sedentary or light active or moderately
active and vigorously active
gee you know three lifestyles
that's uh that's a bit you know there's
not three ways of living
life this is everything in between and
if you subtract 15
from the numbers you get there you're a
good start but
man it's such an approximation and for
you personally for
population it's probably pretty right on
but you're not a population you're one
person or your client you're training as
one person
so for you personally it might not be
exactly correct and it's nothing you can
blindly believe in
just type in to a macro tracker and be
like that's it here's my calories this
is for sure going to lose fat for me
if you want us the simplest formula just
take your body weight
multiply it body weight and pounds so
it's 200 or something
multiply it by 10 to 12 and that gives
you
a real solid hypocaloric condition to
start out with
all right 10 to 12 depending on activity
level and training volume
if your activity low is low and training
volume is low it's closer to 10
closer to 12 if it's relatively high so
okay fine we have all these numbers here
all right now here's the deal
are those equations or tables a pretty
useful tool to get started
yes but the best way to track
to make sure you're actually losing fat
is body weight measurements
right for a couple of reasons one as
we've already mentioned the tables and
the equations can be off by
quite a bit so for example you could be
a person that has just a little bit
lower the metabolism than usual or
your activity rating's just a little
lower than they made with these average
templates or
these average uh equations and you end
up putting in a number and even with the
15
subtracted you your guess at what you're
hypocaloric
at is actually pretty close to iso
caloric
so if you just guess with that equation
and do a 12-week diet
just on that number you're going to lose
no weight because you're going to be
isocaloric and you're going to be
unbelievably frustrated every right to
be
because nothing ever happened so how do
you know
if you're losing weight how do you know
if you're losing fat
well because muscle gain and fat loss at
the same time are super hard
almost all the weight you lose when you
lose weight is going to reflect
fat loss right so
if your values are off a lot the true
test of whether or not you're
actually hypocaloric if you're actually
eating fewer calories than you're
burning
is are you losing weight now it's not
every day there's water weight
fluctuations sometimes it's not even
every week
but every week to two weeks if you're
not losing weight
you know very small minority of people
that are actually hypocaloric
you're actually hypochloric meaningfully
so
you're going to lose weight over the
long term over the weeks for
sure so how do you know if you're
hypocaloric and if your
guess at the equation worked everyone
should start out with an equation or a
table as far as their calories are
concerned
after that you should be figuring out
okay
what do i weigh what do i weigh what do
i weigh after one to two weeks if your
weight isn't going down
it's time to cut calories you may say
you may have all sorts of ideas well
for my metabolism i really should be
losing weight and i feel like it's
hypocaloric
all that doesn't matter because you're
not losing weight we can almost
guarantee you it's not hypochloric
so that means drop your calories by some
amount
and then continue on we'll talk about
what amount to drop them later when we
talk about adjustments
fundamentally weight tracking is
irreplaceable as a tool
to figure out your calories i'll tell
you this a lot of folks that message me
online
they'll say hey you know like what do
you think about this tracker or what do
you think about this
equation what do you think about this
table for calories how many calories do
you need to eat
all i say to them is look figuring out
figure out how much food you eat now
either calories or macros because macros
are epoxy for calories
and start tracking your weight track
what you eat track your weight
after two weeks you'll have an average
number of calories or macros you eat
and you'll have an average weight ta-da
we just did better than any table or
equation could have ever been
and then how do you generate a deficit
well let's say your average is 2 500 and
you want to lose a pound a pound per
week
cut 500 out of that keep you up for
physical activity the weight loss will
almost certainly come so
really it's super individual and it's
best to do body weight tracking in that
case
all right now in order to make sure
that we're hypocaloric right we keep
saying hypocaloric getting hypocaloric
but there's actually three ways of doing
that the first
is just doing more general activity like
if you're more active around the house
you're more active at work
right like construction workers are
often super lean and really good shape
they don't work out most of the time and
they do not have the healthiest eating
habits how come they're like
so lean well because they work
physically all day long and that burns
an
unbelievable amount of calories so
there's that
right so we can increase our general
activity potentially we can also do what
most people do when they start trying to
lose weight
is to do more formal cardio slash
training exercise is almost defined
as the formal practice of physical
activity with the purpose of health
improvement weight loss so on and so
forth
you actually show up to a place you
could call it a gym
get out a piece of equipment or run
around the block a bunch of times or
join a running team or something
and actually do formal cardio and
training to try to burn calories
the last way to try to create a caloric
deficit
is to just eat less food right now
let's take a look at some of the costs
benefits and trade-offs
of all three of those so let's look at
more activity first
really good thing about more general
activity it's low fatigue
like if you're trying to run 10 miles a
day as part of a training program you're
going to be crushed
but if you just generally move more
around the house or to move more around
your job
and take your kids places and stuff like
that you end up
it's not super fatiguing to do that you
actually feel pretty energized versus
like being lethargic on the couch
because it's never really super high
impact or very high intensity so the
fatigue is low so it means it's
sustainable over the long term uh
another thing is it gets stuff done
like you know when you're at the gym
doing cardio someone's like hey would
you would you do the last hour you're
like
nothing i guess from the perspective of
productivity i i was just
literally was on a device like a like a
like a fucking hamster wheel
uh because people can't you know stop
eating too damn much i'm on this thing
trying to burn off stuff i ate it's kind
of kind of absurd to go to the gym in
some sense right
so if you manage to increase your daily
physical activity and go to the store
you can take care of your you know
elderly parents blah blah blah do
everything that life is all about so you
actually have more free time because you
get more stuff done
pretty good deal right so low fatiguing
get actual stuff done
good news is that the research is very
kind to it individuals that have higher
general physical activities
not exercise related are almost always
lighter and leaner than individuals that
have lower physical activities
gee that's really good thing and because
you know
some people that try to exercise it
doesn't pan out for them
but if you try to do more physical
activity it usually pans out and causes
weight loss and fat loss
and for that reason is almost always
recommended
uh within reason right so if you already
super overwhelmed you have 50 different
things to do and you're running around
we're not going to tell you like hey
make sure to increase your physical
activity like what are you supposed to
become a mountain biking instructor or
something like that
you know you have your own career so but
if there's
parts of your life where you clearly
could be more active
that's probably a good idea get more
stuff done and burn all this fat
super low fatigue really really good
stuff um how do we apply this in like a
coaching setting
if someone is down to very little food
or they're already not eating so much
food and you're like hey you know we
need to generate a calorie deficit and
they're like oh man like cut calories
if you talk to them about their
lifestyle they seem very sedentary this
don't move around much
getting them to move around more is like
a really big deal and
oftentimes causes tons of weight loss so
that's something to discuss with people
you suspect are very sedentary if
they're not very sedentary it's it's
much less of an effect
next up formal exercise so
what are the upsides downsides to more
formal exercise well
the thing is is that lifting can count
as formal exercise but just doesn't burn
a lot of calories
per hour versus cardio cardio burns a
lot of calories per hour but then the
the sort of downside is that it's only
one hour out of the day
right and you want to burn some calories
just being alive so anytime the you know
cardio machine says you burn 600
calories
that's 600 minus what you have burned
normally which might have been like 150
so you know that's really like 450
calories that's still plenty more than
you would have burned
but um you know it doesn't match
up to being more active throughout the
whole day
right not exercise activity
thermogenesis neat is what we call just
general physical activity
that stuff can be hundreds and hundreds
of calories even more into the thousands
if you're really active
per day it's hard to do that much cardio
right so cardio is not necessarily as
efficient as increasing
your daily physical activity and it's
doubly inefficient from something that i
mentioned
earlier which is cardio unless you're
listening to podcasts or something or
doing business on the phone
is in effect i wouldn't say lost time
but time sunk specifically and only to
exercise
whereas general physical activity can be
done in a variety of externally
productive things
so cardio definitely has its downsides
there and you can tell like if you talk
to clients or talk to friends at the gym
and you're like
like how should i lose weight and you're
like do more cardio and you're
technically correct
but they're going to be like oh where do
i fit that in right where more physical
activity is by definition
you can fit it in anywhere because it
literally makes you more productive in
your life
right so the final uh verdict on cardio
is that it's healthy and effective for
fat burning
uh so it can be added slowly during a
fat loss plan specifically
when the person or you like to eat like
if you like to keep your food
you're like i don't want to cut too much
food add cardio same effect you lose fat
if you don't want to cut any more food
let's say you've cut your food down
significantly and you're losing weight
but now it's coming
time to do like another cut potentially
and you're like gee i don't know if i
want to eat less food than this
up your cardio instead and you can do
cardio if you have the time and
willingness
right and sort of conversely if you
don't have the time and willingness to
do
much cardio then you can go through
these other methods which brings us to
our last method
less eating this is straight up the most
straightforward one by far
and it's definitely effective if we had
to rank
the most predictable methods for weight
loss
less eating is number one by a long shot
last seating is number one regular
activity is actually number two and
formal exercise
is number three because you can out eat
formal exercise
like you wouldn't believe right
treadmill you know
400 calories come home one donut
treadmill gone
it's literally like that that's how it
works you burn
800 extra calories per day through
physical activity
you probably don't even have time to sit
down or
kind of the willingness because once
you're active and moving if you might
have noticed this you actually tend to
crave
junk food less than normal you still
might crave it but
less interestingly enough being
sedentary
makes you crave junk food more more
often so
definitely rank two a solid second place
is just more general physical activity
cardio is like third although it is
effective right but
there's nothing beats less eating as far
as just if you have to give
someone like if you're sitting next to
someone on a plane and you're you've
been talking to them for a while and
they figured out you're an exercise
professional and you're getting off the
plane now you're going to their separate
ways and like by the way like
what do i do to lose weight i got to get
rid of this like if you actually have
one thing to say be like eat less
right it works it works however
it's not sustainable right so it slows
down your metabolism and reduces
activity a lot if it slows down
considerably
it creates hunger it creates low energy
it creates poor mood like no one likes
to eat less it pisses you off
and uh so we have to approach it
gingerly
right so in what situations do you
choose to eat less
as one of your strategies well if you
can't increase physical activity anymore
like you're like i can't do any more
stuff i ran out of stuff to do i would
just be running laps in my house if i
like did more physical activity
right or if you don't want to you're
already like frayed to the bone
and let's say you're eating tons of food
and you're doing all this physical
activity maybe you just like lower your
food eating and just do normal activity
and you'd be much better
it's just for your life it would be a
better balance another one
is you're not super hungry or low on
energy like
you talk to some people even when
they're beginning a diet and you're like
all right let's talk about cutting food
out of your diet
some people are like no way i'm gonna
i'm already hungry as it is just eating
normal food and try not to get fatter
right or they're like dude every time i
cut my food intake even by a little my
energy just suffers i can't afford that
right like i do this xyz job or whatever
i have these hobbies and i can't cut my
food
but not everyone's like that probably
the majority of people aren't like that
some people are like hey can we eat a
little less and they're like yeah sure
or some people who are normally eating a
lot are super active that i guess for
love god please i'm tired of drinking
these shakes and
smashing all these bananas and stuff
like that if you just eat one less
banana a day that would be amazing so a
lot of people are already eating plenty
and some people eating sort of so
unhealthy or indulging that when you're
like hey you want to back off like ease
off the gas pedal on food for a while
they're like yeah that seems fine
and then for weeks there's no complaint
from them because they're like yeah i'm
actually pretty full and
uh this diet's cool and they could be
like a thousand calorie deficit not that
and i
because they're just not super hungry a
lot of people just aren't food focused
nearly as much as you would think and um
lastly if they're eating objectively
plenty of food it's probably fine to
make a cut like if someone's just eating
a lot of food
right and you look at it and you're like
we can just take out like
pla for example a good example let's say
someone describes to you that they eat
like
four relatively healthy balanced meals
per day and a bit of junk
here and there are some chips some
handful of nuts here and there
throughout the work day
and they eat like uh two tubs of ben and
jerry's at night like every night
or like a pizza you know is it going to
ruin their lives
if you're like hey listen let's do half
a pizza instead of a whole pizza
one tub of ben and jerry's every other
night instead of every night
and like those little snacks in the
middle of the day let's just like cool
it on those
you could have cut like 1500 calories
out of their diet
and they're still eating they're
well-rounded healthy meals and they're
like full and they're like
that's fine right so some people eat
like just out of you know
maybe not boredom just out of pleasure
like the feeding food's great like it's
pizza's delicious and if you're like hey
let's cool it on the pizza for a while
they're still eating lots of food from
other places right whereas if they have
objectively very little food like
they've been dieting for a long time
they've got this little piece of protein
little veggies really good help me like
i'm starving
maybe like you're like oh they if they
sort of start to bottom out on their
weight loss maybe more physical activity
uh we'll talk about later but maybe a
break from the diet altogether is a good
idea but you sure
you sure wouldn't come up to someone
who's eating like a thousand calories a
day and be like
less food that's what's going to do it
so if you've got the food to cut
cutting the food's not a terrible idea
now the real answer is
a lot of these conditions happen at the
same time so
a balance of all of them is a really
good idea so what you might do
is start someone on a diet with plenty
of food
and a decent amount of physical activity
and no cardio at all
and then uh they're losing losing losing
and then they start to stall a little
bit so you could be like hey could you
like get a little bit more active
and they're like yeah sure and they're
like that's sweet that's easy and then
they like make some life choices like
they'll walk instead of drive
or play with their kids more or whatever
they'll do more chores
and then they'll more active and then it
just keeps going down weight loss keeps
going so everything's great
and then at some point you know uh
that's bottoms out as well and you're
like hey you know let's cut some food
out of diet a little bit here and there
extra little cookie or whatever just
lower the calories
they do that they get more results and
then after a while you know
things get pretty tight and they're you
know maybe a month away from their goal
or something like that and
you know cutting more food just seems
like it's going to starve them to death
you'd be like hey let's try like you
know three weekly sessions of 400
calories of cardio and they start doing
that and it kicks them in again and they
start losing weight again or they keep
losing weight
and then at the end of the diet you know
you stop and sort of reintroduce all the
normal food and slowly
rebuild and then just maintain that
weight so all of them can be done at the
same time
but you want to probably layer them in
uh we advise you
against doing full bore any one of them
and none of the others because it just
creates a real asymmetric scenario for
example
someone with a super high physical
activity level could be smashing tons of
food they just don't want to eat
and losing like okay amounts of weight
but all you have to do is like just
ease up on that food a little bit and
they're like oh thank god i was sick and
tired of eating all that food
and boom their weight goes down which is
great that's what we want right
on the other hand if someone has like no
physical activity at all
all right and and you're feeding them
almost nothing
geez they're like super like they get
they start to get cold
and hungry and even lower in energy and
they're just miserable right so maybe
for them
if you increase their physical activity
and actually bump their food up a little
bit
you wouldn't have to cut their food a
lot and they would lose really robustly
and if you need it cardio is always
there formal cardio to just make sure
you're sort of hammering that nail down
like just in case i'm overestimating my
physical activity uh let me just do this
cardio to make sure like
i'm physically active every day to the
extent that i want to be so it's almost
always going to be a combination of
things
all right that's it for calories
let's move on to macros and the first on
our list is protein
why protein matters well first of all
muscles are made almost entirely of
protein in in most analyses or a huge
part of them is protein so eating enough
protein is critical to preserving
muscles to make sure that the muscles
uh don't actually fall off during fat
loss
remember this is fat loss nutrition not
necessarily weight loss nutrition
most people don't you know expect to
lose a lot of muscle on their fat loss
plan which which is
really really bad terrible for
performance terrible for appearance
uh and and basically not very good for
health either
so if you eat plenty of protein you can
conserve your muscle more and one of the
reasons for that
is when you generate a caloric deficit
if you don't have enough protein coming
in
through food your muscles your skeletal
muscles
especially if they're larger than
average which if you're an avid fitness
person
they are your body's not super into
conserving them
like if you lose a bunch of skeletal
muscle but your brain and heart liver
and kidneys are intact
you're good to go you're still healthy
and you can regain that muscle later
but imagine if your body cut calories
from your brain
and your heart and left your skeletal
muscles the same size
holy crap you'd be losing iq points and
dying in your bed at night because you
would you'd still be jacked right
so the thing is if you under eat protein
your body's going to look to where it
can get protein sources for for all
those vital organs like the brain the
heart etc and it's going to literally
take them
from muscle it's going to break down
muscle get free amino acids and shuttle
them elsewhere
that's how it works so in order to
prevent that
plenty of protein has to be a good idea
right
losing muscle degrades your health your
mobility your performance
and this is a really interesting point
most people who are trying to do fat
loss
uh probably want some aesthetic appeal
like they want to look better
be completely honest and most people
when they have an idea of how they're
going to look after fat loss
they don't want to look shapelessly thin
right they want to look
fit right there's like someone who is
like in really good
shape um they have lines
they have curves but they have the
separations and you're like damn they
got like maybe
someone's a little six-pack a little
four-pack going and you're like oh
that's a great look
but you don't exactly look at like
someone that looks like they're starving
to death
and they're like wow look at like their
shoulders are pointy out of their shirt
that's hot like
because some people think that's really
attractive most people don't and not
even for other people just for
themselves
most people just aren't trying to become
skinny i think if you're trying to
become skinny you just ignore all this
protein stuff you just eat less food
if you're trying to become fit protein
absolutely matters right
another cool bonus is uh
protein reduces hunger
right especially up to a point where
you're eating enough of it
past that point maybe other things
reduce hunger better but up to about and
we'll see in a bit the
gram of protein per pound of body weight
per day hunger production effect is
noticeable so if you eat plenty of
protein
you're less hungry you're more likely to
stick to your diet success
this is really important because a lot
of folks that try to do low calorie
diets eat low protein as well and they
get this
crazy rabid hunger and they fall off the
plan but if they eat enough protein
they're like
you know i feel pretty fine and there's
no reason to cheat or less of one
and then they have more success right
[Music]
a huge caveat and this is something most
of you already know but it has to be
said
resistance training highly enhances
muscle retention on a diet
resistance training plus high protein
intake means you lose fat
and very little muscle if any if you
diet
without resistance training but you eat
enough protein it'll help but
a lot of muscle loss will occur anyway
if you diet
uh without resistance training or
without eating enough protein like
there's a typical like 1950s housewife
diet i've just eaten cut every portion
in half or something
uh you're just gonna get smaller but
proportionally you'll lose probably just
as much muscle and fat which is really
kind of a bad deal
right you're not fitter at the end of
that process you're just smaller
and you could be smaller and fitter if
you just trained with weights
and ate protein and then generate a
deficit so really good
to have those fundamental factors and
you can actually simplify this down to
basically an instagram meme
how do you get in shape how do you lose
fat eat enough protein
train with weights generate a calorie
deficit it
really comes down to that almost
everything else
in fat loss nutrition comes down to okay
how do we address those factors
right because that is what's going to be
the biggest difference
so okay protein matters how much does it
matter how much do we need
well we got kind of a similar chart to
the muscle gain
lecture if you have under 5 grams
0.5 grams per pound of body weight per
day so for example if you weigh 200
pounds
if you eat less than 100 grams of
protein per day less than half of your
body weight
then um you're really probably getting
less than
what you need to stay optimally healthy
and you're for sure gonna be losing
muscle
right if you go up to 0.75 to 1.0
you're in a pretty good zone and it's
fine in many cases so if someone said
you know if they were 200 pounds and
they were eating 170 grams of protein
north of 150 and they said hey like do i
need to increase my protein i would
never say we need to
let's say you might have a benefit of
increasing another 30 or 40 grams
but after that it's not a big deal and
if you don't you'll probably be just
fine
a gram to a gram and a half is where all
the benefits occur for most people
um and especially for people that are on
very aggressive diet so if you're losing
a percent of your body weight per week
or something
or if you're very lean you're prepping
for a show north of one gram per pound
of body weight
probably a good idea as far as protein
consumption any less than i would say
it's not optimal
if you do more than a gram and a half
per day so that means like if you're 200
pounds
feeding 300 grams of protein and more
it's probably too much via caloric
constraint hypothesis which is another
way of saying
you have to cut your carbs and fats so
much to accommodate that much protein
that it's not worth it because that much
more protein actually probably doesn't
have any more hunger
effects anti-hunger effects and it
certainly doesn't build or preserve any
more muscle
so then what are you doing are you
missing out on carbs which are also
important in their own right we'll talk
about why in just a second and you're
missing out on fats like if you just a
little less protein down to a gram or so
and then you upped your carbs and fats
everything would go better especially if
you're training for sports
or any kind of fitness endeavor so one
gram per pound is our golden number but
there's some pluses and minuses there
go a little higher go a little lower
depending on the specific case
all right carbs
why don't we just cut our carbs
immediately to generate a deficit
because especially in the context of
training
carbs matter what do carbs do that's
good
well we got a list of ten things now
that have been expanded
so carbs secrete insulin which uh
undergoes so basically there we get
insulin-mediated recovery
right you the more carbs you eat the
more insulin secreted the faster you
recover from training
bonus number one which means by the way
you can build and retain more muscle
bonus number two insulin is directly
anti-catabolic as a hormone so it
literally prevents muscle loss
amazing we'll take it on a fat loss diet
we'll take as much of it as we can
number three glycogen the very presence
of glycogen which is
loaded carbohydrates in your muscles is
super super important in recovery so the
more carbs you eat the more glycogen you
load the more recovered you are on
average from any physical activity
there is glycogen-mediated anabolism
which is directly that muscle growth is
stimulated if your glycogen is full if
your glycogen is closer to empty
muscle growth is not stimulated as much
from any given training stimulus
that's a big deal right which is one of
the reasons that most almost all
bodybuilders
when they try to bulk up they'll do it
on super high carbs because ge carbs are
kind of anabolic
for from at least that perspective and
from a few others
so that's a really good thing and there
is a
contracting of catabolism there so you
figure like okay we're trying
we're not going to be growing a whole
lot of muscle on a fat loss diet which
is normally the case
so why is point number four even here
like why are we worried about anabolism
well because
if you catabolize a certain amount of
muscle per day or you would
if you anabolize an equivalent amount
you're actually back to straight and
you're
saving muscle so basically the way you
prevent muscle loss is to throw as many
anabolic triggers of something as
possible while having a caloric deficit
then on average you insure yourself
against muscle loss it's like
if you have like a crazy you know if
you're the head of a crazy zombie army
right and there's a 1 million zombies
that you're under your command are
taking over the world
if like 50 000 of the zombies die every
day from like you know other
world army shooting them if you can grow
fifty thousand zombies a day and replace
them
you have the same still one million
zombies right don't steal my idea and
take over the world of zombies
or if you do give me a call i'll be your
second in command
we'll rule this hellscape together
it's going to say paradise that wouldn't
exactly qualify
as a paradise maybe the opposite all
right number five
anti-catabolism by alternative to aminos
what does that mean anytime you eat
fats amino acids proteins or carbs your
body has a choice of which ones to burn
and which ones
to use for other functions and if you
just eat
proteins and you don't need a whole lot
of carbs it burns a crapload of protein
for energy
if you eat proteins and carbs it's going
to burn carbs preferentially and leaf
proteins the hell alone that's really
sweet
like up to a point so if you eat a
higher carbohydrate diet
more of the protein that you eat can go
into anti-catabolic
muscular benefits as opposed to just
being burned for literal energy
right so carbs are really anti-catabolic
relative to amino acids
and there's further effects uh if you
eat a higher carbohydrate diet you have
less of the hormone cortisol being
secreted cortisol
is catabolic if you eat more carbs
cortisol is lower so we have
anti-catabolism there
cortisol in part causes fatigue a
general all-around
total body fatigue that adds up over the
weeks of training and over the weeks of
dieting
carbs reduce cortisol so you get less
cumulative fatigue that's a really good
thing
carbs are more filling than fats per
calorie
and if you focus on fresh fruits
and fresh veggies they're actually more
filling than protein per calorie
all right so potentially if you get most
of your carbs from really voluminous
sources like tons of veggies and tons of
fruits
geez you could be eating forever and
still not meet your calories
right so carbs are more filling than
fats for sure so that's an argument
against just lowering carbs and boosting
fats like a keto diet
but generally speaking uh you know carbs
are really filling and that's a really
good thing which is super good on a fat
loss phase
why if you're more full you're less
likely to go off plan and cheat you're
more likely to stick to your calories
and then you're good to go and you're
you're losing your fat and losing weight
more anti-catabolism uh there's very
good evidence to suggest that the muscle
pump
cell swelling in your muscles actually
causes muscle growth
if you've ever trained on lower carbs
before you know that the pump
is a very very muted on a low
carbohydrate diet because you don't have
as much glycogen
there's not enough water in the cell
bringing in everything and you just
don't get as big of a pump you get a way
bigger pump
if you eat carbs the more carbs you eat
the bigger the pump you get to a certain
extent that extent is very high
in a hypochloric diet you want all the
carbs you can get you get the best pumps
you can get
grow the most muscle replace those
zombies so that when muscle burns off
it's replaced to some extent
and there's a net less of a loss of
muscle than there could be
or no loss at all and lastly
a lot of folks watching this are going
to be the kind of people involved in
crossfit a bunch of other sports
a physique sport bodybuilding they're
gonna be training a lot they're gonna be
doing cardio a lot wouldn't it be sweet
if you had
more energy to do that with what do i
mean if you let's say
jack up your fats like crazy and lower
your carbs like crazy that sucks usually
you just don't have as much energy to
train
especially the kind of energy that puts
out sets and reps in the hypertrophy
range sets of 10 sets of 15 sets of 20
those are just best fueled by carbs so
if you jack up your fats and lower your
carbs
you're less energy to train that's less
energy to put in the anabolic and
anti-catabolic stimulus to preserve
muscle
bad deal also if you eat more
carbohydrates
you're and you have a higher blood
glucose level you actually just on
average feel more energetic and you're
more likely to do even harder cardio
more cardio be more recovered and that
way you actually just do more physical
activity throughout the day carbs are
almost like to some extent
very small extent or more so than
proteins and fats self-burning
you eat plenty of fats you kind of feel
the same you eat plenty of protein yeah
you feel fine
you eat plenty of carbs and you're just
like gee like your body temperature goes
up and you're like karate kicking
everything
and you have more of a chance to be more
active and then some of the calories
that carbs bring in you just burn off
with more physical activity whether it's
daily physical activity
or exercise right basically if you eat
plenty of protein
the and you eat lots of carbs for
whatever room you have in under your
deficit
you're going to burn off a lot of
calories just from eating like that
and because you can train harder all the
other things get better gee that's a lot
of good reasons to keep carbs as high as
possible
during a fat loss phase and that's in
fact what we recommend now
what does that mean for choosing carb
intakes well generally the scale to work
effort because you need to have as many
carbs as possible to fuel
whatever activity and training you do so
if your light activity in training or
it's an off day
a gram per pound probably takes care of
most of your needs that means if you
weigh 200
pounds that's 200 grams of carbs a day
if you're moderately active and or
training moderately
voluminous training you know that gram
and a half is fine
and then if it's hard it's two plus and
that plus can get to three four five
uh real fast but generally speaking you
know if you're really training hard and
you're really physically active that
means you probably need at least two
grams per pound
at least to start until your deficit
chops away at that later
so if you're 200 pounds that's 400 grams
of carbs a day that's a lot of carbs
which is really good
because you're going to need it because
you're training so much so on and so
forth and weight loss is probably not a
problem for you anyway
right another method a simpler method to
use
if you don't want to count so much is
you just get your protein intakes at a
needed level gram per pound
you get your fat intakes to the needed
minimum levels which we'll talk about in
just a bit
and you just fill the rest with carbs
right and as you cut your calories you
cut mostly carbs because proteins are
set fats are set
let's talk about fats why do they matter
why can't we just do zero fats
why can't it be the 90s damn it we're
all on zero fat diets well it turns out
fats are actually a must to consume
they're essential in some cases and your
body literally just doesn't make some
kinds of fat so if you don't consume
them
uh you're real real nasty health
problems eventually so you have to have
some fats
and fats support hormone levels
particularly testosterone which is sort
of important
in burning fat and building muscle and
by that i mean it's very important
so fats have their upside for sure
the downside is that fats are super
caloric one of the reasons that low fat
dieting tends to work pretty well on
average is it's really just a proxy for
low calorie dieting
like if you take a cookie and you change
the recipe from regular cookie recipe
to low fat cookie recipe if it's
normally 15 grams of fat
but now you've taken it down to 5 grams
of fat the cookie could taste like
80 or 90 percent as good you're like
yeah it's not the full fat cookie but
whatever at least i don't have to wipe
oil off my fingers
you just took that 10 grams of fat per
cookie
and erased 90 calories holy crap
if you have three cookies a day which is
not unreasonable right how many of you
have opened a chips ahoy container never
had three cookies i usually just eat the
whole container
right which is why i weigh so much so
you know gee that adds up
right three of those a day that's 270
calories
you plug away at that deficit that's a
quarter pound per week
just off eating cookies with 10 grams of
fat less
so fat cutting works because fats are so
caloric
and if you insist on not cutting your
fats from your diet you got to cut
basically more than double because carbs
are four grams or four calories per gram
fats are nine you gotta cut more than
double the amount of carbs to get the
equivalent fats that's rough
right so they're most caloric so it's
easy to cut them out
and too high of a fat intake can
basically be better served by more carbs
so so here's the big knock on fats it's
not a specific knock but it's like this
let's say you insist on eating like 150
grams of fat per day where you could
easily get by with 70 and meet all your
hormonal needs and everything else
and someone's like okay so why do you
eat 150 and you're like i like to eat
150 grams of carbs today all right sweet
so what do you what are you or sorry
grams of fat and someone's like well so
how many carbs do you like well like
100 grams because otherwise i go over my
calories i'm like okay
so how many grams of carbs did you get
if you cut all the way down to 70
like gee you know that's like another
150 grams of carbs or something i could
put in my diet it's so much more
food it's more filling it's got all
those benefits for training look
benefits of fat
testosterone at minimum levels and then
you know they're essential fats we'll
talk about how many of those you need so
it seems like just a double checklist of
like if we just get
a minimum amount of fat we're good to go
what about the checklist for carbs
there's 10 things on that list
and one of the biggest ones is they're
so filling especially if they're
fresh veggies or fresh fruits it's not
even close right
you can eat like a whole plate of
broccoli or
you could eat like one tablespoon of
peanut butter it's the same calories
are you kidding me how many people deep
into a diet are hungrier
after they eat the tablespoon of peanut
butter because it's like oh my god this
is real food finally
it's a huge deal so we need fats
but probably not a ton how do we get to
these values
well the actual minimum of fats is not
super clear from literature just yet
all right uh it's very true that you
probably can eat
less than five grams of total fat per
day and if you eat the right foods
especially fatty fish and stuff like
that
you might be getting enough essential uh
fatty acids that way
five grams of fat per day holy crap the
problem is
probably won't take care of your sex
hormones uh testosterone and so on and
so forth
i found with myself and numbers and
numbers of clients and other people i've
talked to
that if you're getting below 0.3 grams
per pound so that means like
below 60 grams of fat per day if you
weigh 200 pounds
even in hypercaloric conditions sex
drive drops off which is
probably not a great sign for hormonal
variables
so maybe 0.3 is probably like a bottom
end figure
and uh on the other hand levels above
0.5 grams per pound like 100 grams of
fat for someone who weighs 200 pounds
they're fine right if you just
concomitantly lower the carbs
but more carbs are probably better at
any value north of that so
our recommendation here for this course
is like when you're starting a fat loss
process
start around 0.4 grams of fat per day so
that means like 80 grams of fat
for someone who weighs 200 pounds uh 80
grams per day
and then just toggle toggle it up and
down to see how your responses are so if
you like go to 70 and your sex drive is
great and your energy's great
go to 60 and if it kind of sucks go back
up to 70 and kind of 70 is your bottom
value
and then everything else changes with
carbs right but if you you know you
might be one person who needs 90 grams
of fat to feel normal and that's totally
fine
so start at 0.4 toggle up and down a
little bit see how things go
folks that's it for macronutrients for
fat loss
next time we'll do a lecture on timing
food composition and supplements for
fat loss i'll see you then and there
you
