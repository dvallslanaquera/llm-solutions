if a machine could cough from old age
this
this would machine will be coughing
right now everybody knows two things
about me everybody thing one i never go
anywhere without my imperial guard
anyway that was funny in my head
thing two i never ever train in the
current time always take jerry's time
machine to the 1980s
where honestly training was fucking
sweet first of all
the the female scene was kind of neat
look at that woman's hair
amazing
also charlie would have been the biggest
person in the 80s i think
certainly the biggest asian lifter in
the 80s
bolo bolo young is like 180 pounds bro
he's like this tall
that's chun li from bloodsport for those
of you who know your cinema history and
for those who didn't know that uh shane
you should be ashamed of yourself
this intro is great so
so far we've accomplished nothing as far
as talking about we're actually here
we're here to train legs just a little
bitty leg workout tail end of all of our
mezzos actually the beginning of charlie
is the talent of jared's and i we're so
stomachacy fatigued we can barely move
charlie doesn't need huge stimulus
luckily dovetails
you guys ever think what what it's like
when dubs have
an intercourse with each other youtube
won't pick that up right
um
anyway we're here to train legs let's
get it done some leg curls then probably
some long presses maybe a bit of lunging
and some bodyweight squats easy session
we're mailing this one in but we'll have
some tidbits and tips and little quirks
for you guys feel free to make fun of
how easy we're training uh jared say
something white trash to get us going
oh god i need a natty light
daddy light by the way we're in columbus
ohio and this is an amazing gym we're
not gonna tell you where it is because
we don't want you going here and clearly
it's empty and it's literally the arnold
how's that possible
magic let's go do like curls
oh hey guys
leg curls starting out with leg curls
probably do my rep match three or four
sets
set a standard
one rep in reserve or so
for charlie probably three reps in
reserve he's just starting out as mezzo
and then my rep match after that so
second set is going to be as many reps
as the first but as many my rep mini
sets as it takes to get there third set
same idea
and uh hamstrings the machine here is
not ideal
not a ton of tension at the bottom where
lots of growth occurs
but uh we'll rig it a little bit and
put in the work to compensate let's get
it done
preparing for the 2022 nationals charlie
jones came all the way from korea
don't make him laugh while he's doing
this the documentary type of
voice over it's a good idea we can do it
later
oh my god
just take the arnold script to take the
script
pumping iron and just
i'll do the narration
jared feathers an auto mechanic from
ontario california and he's here
challenging for the arnold
schwarzenegger title
[Music]
[Music]
blood
[Music]
[Applause]
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
oh
scott you gotta get us on looking
i'm looking at a competition just like
the documentary
[Music]
that fucking works god damn
holy shit nikes
[Music]
oh dude the seat goes back further get
fucked yeah
[Music]
mike do you shut up sorry hold up never
mind does it i don't
get up here yeah hold up
or not i don't know
never mind
there's extra holes but this is whatever
them
[Music]
south korean ingenuity you think maybe
we'll see oh oh
yeah buddy
damn
oh shit
i almost look cool there
i'll take it yeah
just like ultra light high reps
this is like a vertical leg press kinda
all right folks
exercise number two leg press
leg press
this machine i think
took its last breaths in the 80s so
we rigged it a little bit
did some stuff to it
it's gonna be what we call
workable
not ideal
a little bit of compromised rom
compromised body position
we're going to make up for that by
staying light
going for ultra high reps lots of mile
reps
so let's see how it works
actually i can hold this it's just i
think i need someone to knock this down
yeah
uh jared you want to get one side what
we're going to unrack and rack for
charlie
i can rack it it's just that on rack i
want to get a grid grip on this
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
there you go charlie
[Music]
one more
[Music]
oh
thank you good shit
oh
[Music]
[Music]
what
[Music]
all right so
blog press wasn't really working for
jared and i
um charlie's gonna still do it jared and
i are gonna do leg extensions and
probably for my reps
and i'm going to super set my leg
extensions to sissy squats or basically
heel elevated
squats
and jared will do something he's always
doing something lean back on a leg
extension and actually change your quads
better because it's more stretched i
don't agree
it's where there's adjustments jared so
you can do it wrong and i can do it
right all right
[Music]
uh
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let's go jared mike unless you're gonna
do between my my reps huh once you do
between my my reps uh this because it
takes the stretch off of your quads
you fucking moron
[Laughter]
they're fighting again
oh
your ceo dad
nick
nick frat house fuck slut nick shot
loves attention
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
good shit
fuck yeah charlie
[Music]
king fucking charles let's go
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
thank you
yeah yeah come
uh on is my third last set of lag
extensions my reps 15 total
reps per set
and afterwards i do a total of 15 60
squats more or less heel elevated spot
uh short break so it's metabolite
sequestration unfortunately we didn't
find any machines for jared knight at
least to be able to do any heavy loading
so that's what we have to do kind of you
know this is one of those on the fly
kind of sessions
uh this is my last set of the day for
quads so i'll be doing all set is a
funny way to put it instead of 15 li
extension
set of 15 on the sissy squat and then
with quad still burning i'm gonna try to
attempt
20 walking lunges
[Music]
uh
[Music]
um
[Music]
ouch
[Music]
here's the thing folks
with the exponential
rise of technological progress and
economic development
the
today's better than the 80s yeah on
every facet except to quote a very good
friend of mine who were named anonymous
cocaine
there was a lot of in the 80s and that
was fun
what do you guys think
there's probably more of it now there's
probably more cocaine better quality
cheaper probably yeah on the dark web oh
definitely definitely on the dark web
so it's better in every imaginable way
don't go on the dark web it's full of
strangers and bad people
um
if you have a time machine take it to go
uh kill dinosaurs with a 50 cal skip the
80s
and uh
if you show up to this fine gym they got
a lot of really cool equipment give it a
shot see you next time
what's up folks just want to drop a
little preview of the rp diet app and
some cool stuff i've been beta testing
on my phone give everyone that just
watched this video a little preview of
what's to come in the app so come check
it out what i'm about to do so this is
the app this is the version that i'm
using and i
traveled in last night to the arnold
expo this weekend and so i wasn't quite
prepared
and this little workout shake here i did
not end up having
because you know whatever i got in kind
of late wasn't able to get to the
grocery store so what i'm gonna do
is the app now has the ability to go in
and you can edit your meal plan
which means check this out custom macros
for the day
you can now move this around so what i'm
going to do
is i'm going to
take what was there for my intro workout
shake i'm going to take that down to
zero because i didn't have one
now what i'm going to do is i
really enjoyed that post-workout meal
yes that is 155 grams of carbs
post-workout and i had a little extra
protein but you can see down at the
bottom
right it tells you exactly what you have
left so i have 10 grams of protein left
for the day so what i'm going to do is
i'm just going to put a little bit of
that in my other meals that way
everything else is pretty well balanced
but i was able to have a big
post-workout meal and then again if
you're ever unsure you're gonna you'll
get a little confused like oh hey where
should i have been you just reset to the
rack recommended macros and that's it so
again for people that have been asking
about this for a long time it's it's
coming pretty soon this is just going to
give people more flexibility because you
know sometimes life happens you're out
maybe you're out to eat you're at a work
event or you're with family friends
whatever you go a little bit over one
meal no worries you just come in here at
the end of the day hit save you're good
to go you can keep everything right on
track so that's it i think everyone's
gonna really really enjoy this next
update coming out pretty soon
