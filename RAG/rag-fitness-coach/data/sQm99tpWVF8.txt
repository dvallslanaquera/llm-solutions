my name is Jeff nippard
so I'm a natural bodybuilder and power
lifter from Canada
[Applause]
however much I'm obsessed with
bodybuilding and power lifting now
that's exactly how I was with basketball
when I was a teenager
going to the NBA was everything that I
wanted to do
I would remember you know as a Toronto
Raptors fan watching like on the TV
Vince Carter
same thing with Kobe
[Music]
[Applause]
Nate Robinson
[Music]
but I would say my favorite was for sure
Allen Iverson
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
playoff record for three-pointers
like he was just so flashy and explosive
and he was one of the shortest smallest
players in the NBA at the time and yet
he still considered one of the best of
all time which is pretty amazing
I remember when I I was such a fan that
I noticed he had a tattoo on his
shoulder that said Only the Strong
Survive
[Music]
procedure that really resonated with me
because I saw him as a player that
really did have to overcome some
limitations to be as successful as he
was
[Music]
that would serve as inspiration for me
if I wasn't going to be the tallest guy
on the court if I was going to be the
shortest guy on the court then I had to
make sure I could jump higher than
anybody else so I got absolutely
obsessed with improving my vertical jump
I would do thousands of Skips a day
run every JUMP program that I could find
and just became totally obsessed with
jump training
[Music]
put the Russell
breaks his head
again
at a certain point also like you just
have to be realistic about your like
limitations and your strengths
um and so when I started seeing progress
like really really quickly in the gym
that was when I kind of said okay my
hand was dealt better for bodybuilding
than it was for basketball and then when
I discovered that there is like there
was such thing as a science-based
approach to like bodybuilding and
strength training
[Music]
I got just as obsessed with that as
anything else and at the time all the
best science-based coaches and athletes
were doing powerlifting in their off
season from bodybuilding so for me it
just made sense to blend that approach
where yes you're training to build
muscle but you're also training to get
strong like I want I don't want to just
look like I have muscle I want to be
able to put that muscle to use I want to
actually be strong
I started to think of it like I would
let my strength be the goal and let my
physique be the outcome
[Music]
there is something
nerve-wracking but also
very exciting about
putting a weight on your back
that you've never held before
squatting down to the ground
and standing back up
[Music]
or you see a Wade on the ground
you go over
and see if you can pick it up
it's an amazing feeling when you
actually lock that weight out that was
like that had become my new basketball I
guess you could say like maybe even more
so like I was just obsessed with
that competitive spirit and with this
thing that I actually excelled at at
this time I said I'm gonna really go all
in with the power lifting style training
and see what I can do you know on the
international level
um
[Music]
at this time when I was competing in
powerlifting I was actually in school
but I didn't tell you know five six pm I
would usually end up training super late
at night but I would take the bus
sometime around 11 p.m or midnight to
the closest 24-hour gym which was like a
30 minute bus ride from my place and
usually train there for like a couple
hours to finish up at 2 A.M and then
take the bus back and then you know
class will start again at 8 A.M so there
wasn't a lot of time for sleep
at this time I competed in Canadian
Nationals for power lifting and won the
silver medal there it was the power
lifting event that qualified me for the
Arnold and powerlifting other than
worlds probably the biggest
International competition so like people
will come from all over the world to
compete there I knew that if I wanted to
compete on such a high level I needed to
bring up my deadlift at the time you
know I was thinking well I'll do
whatever I need to do to get my deadlift
up I started deadlifting five days a
week and that was when everything came
crashing down
it's kind of weird how this happens like
just doing my regular warm-up and then
all of a sudden I felt my back just
tighten up like it became rock hard
and so I just hit the ground couldn't
get back up I had to get carried out of
the gym on a stretcher
[Music]
that ended up
really
um I guess holding me back for quite a
while it ended up being a pretty serious
injury
[Music]
so it just so happened that at this time
I hurt my back I started really gaining
popularity online and there was a solid
subset of people who were consuming my
content who would point out that oh hey
you're like Squad isn't that great or
you're all your deadlift is not that
strong or whatever and
I think this also led to people
giving me or some people giving me sort
of a reputation that I'm a science guy
who reads a lot of studies but doesn't
actually train all that hard himself
so around that period of time rise
reached out to me about the signature
line
and so we started brainstorming ideas
about like colors and different designs
and stuff like that I really wanted to
go with like a minimal look with kind of
like neutral tones and then I really
like the pop of red
for whatever reason red just signifies
kind of like a more like gritty strong
uh look to it so I think that that's
captured in the clothes the thing that
probably came to mind first was these
shorts I'm wearing I like shorts that
have like a short outer short style and
then compression underneath them and I
think that these are super cool I've
never actually seen a design where you
have the black on the outside and then
the white compression underneath I think
they look super super cool
I also wanted to do a warm-up t-shirt
that you can kind of like wear over a
tank top or maybe if it's like a cold
day and you know during your warm-up
sets
um for the tank tops I wanted something
that kind of like fit really well around
like the chest but like didn't look like
so tight that it was like kind of corny
um and then I have some like of the the
camo designs built in
I also wanted to make stuff that is a
little more uh street wearish that you
could just wear wherever and I think the
scoop necks make you look really jacked
so that's basically why I went with
those I think that they just are really
complementary for the physique
everything was looking really cool but
we needed to decide on a slogan for the
line and so I ended up thinking of the
Allen Iverson tattoo Only the Strong
Survive it perfectly captures how it is
you overcome any kind of setback or
Challenge and you know push through to
the next level
seeing that slogan on the signature line
when I was a teenager that would have
motivated me to want to be the best
basketball player that I can beat now
thinking about that tattoo and that
saying again
made me I guess question like am I
actually living up to my potential am I
training as hard and diligently as I
should be it was at that point that I
kind of flipped the switch again and I
said okay no matter how long this takes
if it takes me two years three years or
whatever like I want to be able to
be strong once I realized that I was
letting this fear of re-injury hold me
back I just completely committed to
letting that go

foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it feels like it's kind of come full
circle for me honestly my back feels
better than ever I've let go of that
fear and I see myself you know as a
strong competent lifter again
hurting my back in the gym getting
carried out of the gym on a stretcher
having to drop out of the Arnold you
know all these years later having built
my strength back up over time just
adding you know plate after plate to the
bar kind of reminds me of that Allen
Iverson tattoo that I loved as a kid
saying
Only the Strong survived
