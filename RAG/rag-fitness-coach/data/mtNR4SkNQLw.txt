ooh incline
curls yes yes not ideal you can see he's
hipping into it I'm not mad at it but
less hipping into it would be good this
is a great movement my recommendation
for you guys at home is to take the
incline bench and turn it literally down
into a flat bench lay down on the flat
bench and do the curls till the
dumbbells touch the ground and come back
up you get even more tension applied at
the stretch which will grow your biceps
maybe even a little bit better than the
incline curl the incline curl is a great
exercise I use it all the time they can
all be the best exercise but lying
dumbbell curls is some you guys get
uh should give a shot to it might be
worth it
