approximate example here is that kid in
your high school we all had one just
played video games and ate Snickers bars
and had like apps and you're like I hate
you
hey folks Dr Mike here with Renaissance
periodization and today's video asks the
question of how lean can somebody get
how lean can you get and what are the
inputs that go into such a thing what
are the determinants
to say how lean you can get now the
first thing many people will say uh and
I used to do this all the time is
they'll hear something and they'll say
well it's drugs Dr Mike
you just take drugs and you get lean and
that's what determines leanness is how
many drugs you take now that's actually
not true there is a common misconception
almost exclusively within people who do
not compete in bodybuilding
in the misconception is that natural
bodybuilders cannot get as lean as
people who are using drugs in
bodybuilding and that's false if you pay
attention to the sport of real natural
bodybuilding drug free you will realize
that drug-free bodybuilders
get limit lean psychotically lean
nonsensically lean
if you need someone to look to for that
example just go on Instagram and type in
Marvin physique
Marvin the Martian from Hong Kong a good
friend of ours here at the channel and
he's draw a lifetime drug free at easy
ways he's five nine and he weighs 154
pounds before he start accusing him of
drug use remember that
and he's as lean as anyone could ever
hope to be it's insane he has like loots
on his face it's really strange so
there's tons of other examples
uh Peter fitchen comes to mind you can
Google him a bunch of the people he
coaches come to mind outrageously
natural is absolutely possible there is
no drug that makes you leaner as a
matter of course
there is no drug that can make you
leaner than an adjusted properly
adjusted calorie deficit and good diet
can make you
the only question is how much muscle do
you have at the end of that process
if you diet to get Ultra lean drug free
because you're not taking anabolic and
Other ergogenic Drugs you will not be as
big muscularly before you start that
diet as someone who was taking the drugs
and also on the way down to getting as
lean as possible you will lose more
muscle than someone who is actually
taking tons of drugs
so you maybe weigh 165 pounds whereas
your theoretical counterpartner an
alternate universe that's identical in
every way except that they you took
drugs in that Universe weighs 200 pounds
you can be just as lean on stage in both
situations
so that is the deal now of course being
165 lean on stage versus 200 lean on
stage the whole process involved with
that is way healthier if you do not take
drugs so remember that big upside there
is Health it's not actually leanness so
if you want to take drugs
to get as lean as possible you have to
understand you don't actually need drugs
gives me as possible if you want to take
drugs to be as muscular as possible to
get a level of leanness then yes that is
something that drugs can do so if it's
not drugs that we're going to be talking
about here that's out of the way
we have five other reasons at least that
determine how far you can go in your
personal Journey should you choose to
take it
of getting as lean as you can and the
first one is genetics
and interestingly enough
in most circumstances outside of one
which is appetite genetics
the genetic proclivity to store fat is
not a huge determinant of how lean you
can get because of how powerful the
other factors we are going to discuss in
a minute are
but genetics so so to put this another
way if you started out with sub-optimal
genetics and you kind of just a little
bit thicker and chunkier by default
let's say you carry a 20 body fat just
at your normal level You're athletic you
train you eat well just 20 that's what
you are as a male 30 as a female with
applying the other variables that we're
going to talk about you actually can
probably get striated glutes
how difficult that is for you is going
to be very different how long it's going
to take is going to be very different
so while that's a true statement it's
also a true statement to say that people
with good genetics for being lean can
get very very lean with much less work
approximate example here is that kid in
your high school we all had one who was
like 16 years old didn't lift weights
just played video games and ate Snickers
bars and had like ABS clear six-pack and
bicep veins and you were like what
that's where you start your life
and then you're like he decides to get
into body balloon when he's 22 and four
weeks later he has strided glutes and
you're like I hate you
Dexter Jackson famous example
up until he was in his late 30s I
believe he had already won tons of pro
shows been to the Olympia a bunch of
times he just never did cardio he just
didn't do cardio it had not done cardio
and he would diet for I think like uh
six to eight weeks he would just clean
up his diet and voila glutes within two
weeks contest conditioning within six to
eight that's a real thing that's the
real thing That's genetics
second thing that determines how lean
you can get is how long your fat loss
phase is some people will do you know
six weeks or eight weeks of fat loss
dieting at you know half a percent or
one percent of loss per week and it'll
be like oh man like I got pretty lean
but gee whiz I wish I'd get leaner well
you just die longer up to 12 weeks of
dieting can make a really really big
change and a lot of times people in
contest prep for bodybuilding
they'll do 14 or 16 weeks of prep
sometimes 20 weeks of prep well 20 weeks
of fat loss dieting is tough very very
tough and very perilous for your
probability to just rebound and get fat
again but if you handle those
concerns well you know people see that
your transformation from off season to
your show and they're like oh my God how
did you do it it's like what if you diet
for 20 weeks losing 0.75 of your body
weight each week on average
you're gonna get a lot leaner kind of a
no-brainer but it must be said like yeah
this is how it happens when people ask
you if you're really good at dart
throwing and I ask you how'd you get so
good at dart throwing like the chances
are so yes you have genetic proclivity
to be more accurate at Short distances
fine motor skill is very good fine motor
control but also like you probably
practiced start throwing a while and I
could after you practice anything a
while you get pretty fun good at it
right
next and more importantly
the determinant of how lean you can be
and this is the most maybe one of the
most real world things to say in this
lecture
is how many
fat loss phase maintenance or even a
little bit of massing in their phase
sequences can you stack together over
the long term
because if you start at a 20 fat
and you get down to 14 facts or nice
long hard fat loss phase you're a lot
leaner than you were but you're not
objectively very lean for a male you're
like you know like athletic and healthy
and everything's great look great
but you could say to yourself after that
fat loss phase you're like right go to
maintenance and you say geez I don't
know how the contrast bodybuilders do it
I don't know how really lean people do
it I just hold fat loss phase and I'm
like where am I I'm like still 14 no but
hold on a second
you take two three four months in a
maintenance phase maybe even a slow
massing phase you restart your next fat
loss phase at 16 body fat and you end up
at 12 after that
wow significantly leaner maintain
maintain maintain the next fat loss
phase takes you to nine percent
I know it's possible because I've done
this multiple times with people on a
bunch with myself
if you just don't Mass up to the same
percent body fat every time you do a fat
loss phase if you can even shave off one
net percent body fat in each one of
those Cycles hopefully something like
two or three percent per macro cycle
after a while because you never quite
come up to the old level that you were
at you can get really really lean and
you can find yourself in a position
where you're a 10 body fat at the end of
a maintenance phase and you're like
I think I'm in a position to like get
show lean and you may very well be so a
lot of times people look at people who
are really lean and here's the whole
point of this part of the talk
and they go oh my God like Ah that's
crazy that guy's so lean huh I just
thought that's not in me hold on a
second
how many sequential phases of fat loss
have they gone through a lot of contrast
bodybuilders report especially their
later years in their late 30s and early
40s that are getting lean to them
it's actually very easy at this point
because they've done it so much because
they just never get very fat again after
their show I mean like you get down to
four percent for bodybuilding show you
can eat like a fucking pig for two
months and come up to nine percent and
like run out of room to eat like I don't
want to eat anymore
still have veins in my abs
and a semblance of glute detail from the
side
this is just my life now but you earned
that life because you did so many months
and years of sequencing fat loss phase
maintenance and mass fat loss phase
maintenance mass and that maintenance
and mass doesn't come up to where that
last fat loss phase took the fat off of
you so it's a net loss by a small margin
every single time you structure enough
of that together and all of a sudden
it's like yeah
we think about if you were a wrestler
and you went to a two-week wrestling
camp during the summer it's going to
make you way better at wrestling for
sure
but how much better can one wrestling
camp really make you not much how much
better can one fat loss phase make it
much leaner plenty but you know
something it can't hold on to but if you
do like four wrestling camps in a given
season you're gonna be a stunt just the
same way if you do four sequenced
fat loss
Mass phase maintenance repeat and each
one is two to three percent lower in
body fat
gee whiz you know two years later you're
gonna be like eight percent body fat
lower just walking around
that is one hell of a way to get really
really lean it's the secret so make sure
that you know that and if you ever doubt
yourself about well I can never get as
lean
it's not all one shot you don't start at
30 body fat and you're like all right I
just got to get to as lean as I can and
that's all I can get uh-huh that
maintenance phase at the end a little
slow Mass means you don't have to come
back up to the level of body fat you
used to be and the next diet is easier
and easier and so on so easier not
psychologically easier uh you get better
results with it you are leaner every
single time
next concern Point number four in
determining how lean you want to get is
how much muscle you want to trade off
this is a point that's pertinent
especially to folks in competitive
bodybuilding folks that are trying to
get really lean for holidays or
something like that like for the summer
everyone reaches at some point this
maybe four or six weeks out where their
training is not of a very high quality
anymore it's uh maybe not slipping but
it's like my training could be better if
I ate more food my training could be
better if I slow down my rate of loss
I would not get as uh a little bit
weaker during the end of prep as I could
be
and that's a fork in the road if you
choose to go right
and you eat a little bit more slow down
your rate of loss you're gonna get very
lean and you're gonna keep all of your
muscle and it's going to be amazing
if you take the fork in the road that
leads left you're going to lose
potentially a little bit of muscle you
can gain back all of it within weeks
after the diet ends and you go back into
an intelligent massing phase so don't
worry about not long-term loss
but if short term you can sacrifice a
little bit of strength and a little bit
of fullness
you can continue that deficit and you
will get fucking lean
to a level what you thought oh yeah this
is crazy
I did this at my last show where I got
nice and dry for the first time in my
life and lean enough to wear
I started the diet at some point around
240 pounds
I was on stage at 216 217 pounds
that's really small I did not like
singing I stepped on scale it was 2 16.5
or something and I was like
fuck
I'm tiny but oh my God it was I shredded
to the fucking bump
[Music]
do you want to get lean or not
ideally would you get lean and be like
big Romney where he's 290 on stage yes
but you might not have that for the
other reasons genetics drugs Etc and
thus if you really want to get lean and
you're willing to trade off a little bit
of short-term muscle and strength
it'll be worth it is what I'm trying to
say do because you'll get so much leaner
that the overall look will be like wow
if you see a guy that's pretty if you're
into competitive body when you see God's
pretty lean but not very very lean
you're like oh that guy looks great how
much does he weigh 220 great
you see a guy that's very very lean and
it turns out he weighs 207. you don't
ask him for his body weight you don't
care because if he walks out on stage
and actually yeah that's pretty lean
you're like there's one guy in the show
and that's the lean guy first place get
out of here nobody cares how much you
weigh when you're that lean it's worth
it it's worth it for that last little
bit this is a lesson I wish I knew 10
years ago when I started bodybuilding
formally and competing I wish I knew
that that extra bit of muscle loss at
the end and strength loss was worth that
insane huge difference in stage look
thank you
[Music]
never going to be the same
lastly the last variable to determine
How likely is it that you're going to
get very lean is of course psychology
and it's a really really big one
not everyone has it in them at any given
point in their life to push hard and
long in a deficit
to push hard and long in sequential
deficits that are separated by mate and
Sandra massing phase
another thing about psychology is how
bad your appetite gets ravenous appetite
can really just prevent you from getting
into that last weird low single digit
area which is like a strange Bizarro
world the thing is appetite is mostly
genetic as well so that actually goes
back up to genetics but nowadays we have
drugs like some magnetite enters
appetite that can probably just knock
that out and it's not really a concern
anymore so back to that
in most cases
not all some genetically gifted people
really can just get insanely leaned with
minimal effort
or they just lucked out that their
appetite isn't that high so just kind of
train and eat high protein foods and
voila they have striatic glutes but in
most cases the people who get extremely
lean and in almost all cases the people
who started out not very lean to get
extremely lean they're just very
mentally resilient so if you ever ask
like man how does that guy so lean a
part of the answer is that guy's got
fucking balls those balls have balls all
right girl she's got ulrey's on top of
her ovaries or some shit like that it
just takes a lot
and it pays off and it's not the kind of
teeth grinding resilience like ah I'm
gonna do this it's more of an ability to
remain calm as the world around them
crashes apart
they feel like they don't have any
energy that's okay I didn't expect to
have energy
I feel a little loopy and lost at work
that's okay I front loaded most of my
work for because I knew the last four
weeks was going to be terrible
they're training they're not as strong
as they used to be that's okay I know
that I've calculated this trade-off to
point number four I'm willing to trade
it off
it's okay that I'm not my very best in
every other area of life and then I'm
entering into this very dark desperate
world of exotic leanness and I can you
know what is that like Christian prayer
like Yay shall walk through the valley
of the whatever the fuck and not be
whatever because God's got my back you
know what I'm saying that shit
that's some wisdom you got to have that
shit to go in with you because shit will
get really hard and the people that
survive that to end up on the other side
lean a shit they can be calm and relaxed
when everything around them and inside
them is screaming stop the diet this
isn't worth it you don't want to get to
sleep if you could do that
if your genetics are decent
if you can do it over the long term with
multiple sequential phases you too Mr
viewer Mrs viewer Miss viewer and miss
miss viewer
can get much much leaner than you think
and I'll leave you with that and see you
guys next time
