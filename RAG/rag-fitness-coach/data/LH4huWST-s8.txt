if you eat anytime you're in the mood a
lot of times you'll be eating often
especially considering that snacks are
often very palatable they're very tasty
it's what I called snacks
because of that they're oftentimes
really high in calories and because
they're super tasty and high in calories
you just kind of keep wanting to eat
them and voila you get into the
situation where you can add up an
unbelievable amount of calories some
people get in over a thousand calories
per day every day just through snacks
alone is not that hard
