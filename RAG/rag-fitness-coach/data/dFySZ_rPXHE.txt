hey folks dr mike israel here back with
fat loss dieting made simple episode
number four
episode video choosing
meal size and meal timing so last time
in the three videos we had preceding
this
we finished structuring the diet into
tract
so we know what we're eating mostly
healthy foods and
we're hitting specific macros eating to
hunger
now we have to figure out how to
regiment ourselves a little bit further
because the more regimentation we can
impose
and get used to the easier the real
pushing
hard stuff of the fat loss plan later
the easier that's going to be
so now we have to figure out how many
meals to eat and when to eat them okay
there are a few factors here why we're
concerned with this because we could say
it doesn't matter who cares just eat
whatever food comes along as long as
it's the right amounts portions quality
well here's the thing
a regular meal schedule has been shown
over and over
to be superior for both results and
getting you leaner
and for adherence which is what fuels
results because if you fall off the
wagon and people who have unstable meal
schedules
fall off the wagon more often you don't
accomplish that fat loss result even if
you are on your way to achieving it
number two a regular meal schedule makes
meal prep
bulk meal prep in advance much easier
which is great because bulk meal prep in
advance saves you
big time if you have all your meals in
the fridge and a bunch of the rest of
them in the freezer for the whole week
or you cook twice a week
it's just a matter of taking our
tupperware pop under the microwave boom
and you're good to go if you cook all of
your meals each time you can do that
if you get your meals on the go you can
do that you do that a lot
it becomes wildly inconvenient and the
burden of how much you have to deal with
cognitively
and effort wise on the diet can suck and
as your calories will know down to very
few
and your cardio and activity start to
rise in order to keep losing fat at the
very tail end of the fat loss
that's really tough already you could be
pretty stressed and pretty overwhelmed
remember
the rest of life doesn't stop for you so
your kids still yell at you
think throw hot dogs at the tv whatever
kids do and you still have to operate
if you don't have to think about meal
prep but for four hours a week
and then you just robotically take out
tupperware and eat it that is amazing so
if you have a meal plan
and if you have a certain number of
meals scheduled out making a bulk meal
prep is the easiest thing in the world
if you don't have a meal plan
a good guide you're kind of eyeballing
right and of course
your daily schedule becomes much easier
so the bulk meal prep is good for its
own thing
but if you know what meals to eat and
when even if you're cooking them by
yourself
you know like i wake up an hour later i
have this
amount of food for breakfast and four
hours later this so if someone says hey
can you come to a racquetball game later
at 7 pm you know you pack your meal with
you you say ooh can you guys make it 8
p.m because i actually have a meal
before then or meal after
so on and so forth so once you know your
meal schedule
it's really easy to go day to day today
and here's the
interesting insight successful fat loss
just means doing your day to day to day
stuff correctly
day in day out day in day out that's it
so if your day-to-day is easier and
you're well on your way
and lastly proper meal size and timing
can make your workouts better
can make your workouts more effective to
burn fat and build muscle
it can make your daily energy levels
higher which can mean you're not a piece
of crap around everyone you love
all the time on your fat loss diet and
it can even make your sleep better
so all of a sudden meal timing even
though directly it doesn't have a huge
role in body composition indirectly it
has a massive one
all right so how many meals should we be
eating technically speaking you can eat
one meal a day
and get pretty damn good fat loss and
even muscle retention
as long as your macros are correct and
it's mostly healthy foods that's really
a thing
however if you eat more like three to
five meals per day and you can eat more
if you'd like
you hit a couple of really awesome check
marks that one meal a day does not get
nearly as well first your hunger will be
lower so if you eat one meal a day
you're hungry for a lot of the day if
you eat three to five meals a day you're
never really that hungry
secondly energy for daily tasks okay
if you eat your first meal of the day uh
if you your only meal the day in the
morning by the evening you suck
and good luck sleeping if you eat your
meal in the middle of the day then in
the morning you suck and then at night
you suck in the middle of the day you're
fine or actually i'm sorry
in the morning you might be okay because
you're running off cortisol uh towards
the early afternoon before that big meal
you're useless which is by the way most
when most people work
so it's kind of crappy like hey bob you
get those copies done you're like
actually i haven't eaten all day yet and
like okay what are you what are you in
college or high school like no i'm doing
this cool
fat loss diet sucks it's destroying my
career you don't want to do that and of
course if you place your one meal at the
end of the day
that's nice you might disrupt sleep a
little bit because there's so much food
in your stomach it's kind of tough to
sleep and digest at the same
time you can't lay on your stomach and
also the entirety of the day sucks
specifically the middle and end of the
day
before you get to eat so instead of like
driving to pick up your kids at soccer
practice they're just like kicking the
ball by themselves and it's dark and
they're man in the trench coats in the
shady corner of the field and you're
nowhere to be found because you passed
out because you haven't eaten a lot so
definitely more daily energy is really
really good if you have an evenly spread
three to five meals per day muscle
sparing is a big deal
especially for those of us who are
interested in looking lean versus just
skinny
and if you eat three to five evenly
spread meals per day you can probably
save
more muscle reduce muscle loss than if
you eat just one meal per day not by a
huge margin but by definitely something
that's measurable
and if you care about your results
probably mean something to you
and lastly energy for training okay if
you eat one meal a day
gee if you eat that meal before training
you have great energy but then your
recovery from training sucks because you
know anything after
if you train first and then eat your
meal
man you know training on an empty
stomach has its upsides it also has its
downsides
so it's not ideal ideally you want a
meal before training to give you energy
and after training to give you recovery
and multiple meals accomplish that in a
way that one simply can't
right so three to five meals a day is a
really good idea
and then the next question is where do
you place them okay and we have a couple
of suggestions
first you want to place a meal within a
few hours of waking to give yourself
good energy and to stop the muscle
breakdown process
second you want a definitely a
post-workout meal to fuel muscle growth
so after you work out that's maybe your
most important meal of the day is the
post-workout meal to get right after or
you know within an hour
and then in general you want a meal
roughly every six
hours or so to keep muscle growth high
and to keep muscle
breakdown as low as possible in addition
to give you sort of steady energy
and also you following that rule the
next rule last rule is you probably want
to eat sort of within two hours
of bedtime so that you can have low
hunger levels and you can sleep really
well
you don't want to eat right at bedtime
because the digestion and sleep
sometimes don't
come together super well early digestion
when the food is still in your stomach
so like
roughly two hours to maybe one hour
before bedtime you eat your last meal
and that can also provide you with a
high level of protein
or amino acids as they digest into your
blood and then
that can prevent muscle loss and sort of
help you gain a little muscle recover a
little better from training
while you sleep so if you want to spread
your meals out
this is kind of the formula here for how
to select the number of meals and how to
spread your meals out
so that they're most logical right now
what about macros per meal so we have
all the meals spaced out that makes
sense
what about how much protein carbs and
fats relative to each other do we want
an each meal well generally speaking
protein can be pretty even per meal you
just sort of need it
pulsed relatively similarly throughout
the day
to support muscle gain which is a
process that takes days
and prevent muscle loss which is also a
process that just continually requires
input of protein
carbs you can eat just the same number
of carbs
at every meal no problem but it's
probably a little better to put
more carbs pre and post-workout than
other meals and because you
have run low on the carbs a little less
for the other meals so if you work out
let's say in the middle of the day
then you know your first meal might not
be that many carbs your second meal
which is going to be a pre-workout meal
has a ton
your meal after has a ton of carbs as
well and then maybe you have a fourth
meal later in the evening that has fewer
carbs as well because we just don't have
that many
right and then fats operate on a
completely opposite
relationship fats generally if you eat a
high-fat meal before you work out
the digestion can interfere with
training you can get kind of vomiting
and post-workout you want the nutrients
to get as quickly to the muscles as
possible
eating a high amount of fat right
post-workout may not be ideal
because then you don't get the nutrients
into the muscles fast fat tends to
digest slowly itself and also slows down
the digestion of all the proteins and
carbs it's eaten with
so if you have like a huge piece of uh
cake and a giant thing of ice cream just
make an absurd example you know let's
say healthy you go to chipotle get a
burrito with guac and all this other
stuff
tons of fat tons of healthy fat and you
eat it right after training there's
going to be a few hours there where
there's not a whole lot of burrito
in your blood bloodstream yet because
it's taking so long to adjust so we want
fats to be lower pre and post workout
and that means we get more fats they're
going to be higher in the hours
way way before and the hours after
that's it simple simple rules and if
i'm talking too fast or all this is
seems like nonsense to you just pause
the video and read these things read the
slides and i promise it's super super
simple
now here's an example we're using our
150 pound person
150 pounds why i need to lose fat that
was my first my first question you just
get bigger but in any case 150 pound
person example from all the other videos
we've done so far in this series
and they their daily macros are 150
protein
60 fats and 215 carbs here's a sample
four meal plan for them just like i sort
of described
and with macro amounts now i'm not gonna
read these off to you i just want you to
pay attention to three things one their
protein is really similar meal to meal
to meal
sweet and their fats are a little bit
higher outside the workout
closer when it's closer to workout
they're lower and then the carbs are
pretty low
on you know the out the outside meals
breakfast and
pre-bad meal breakfast has a little more
carbs pre-bed has very very few
and then plenty of carbs in the
pre-workout meal to give tons of energy
tons and tons the most carbs in the
post-workout meal to promote recovery
muscle growth and so on and so forth
right um
we have all the stuff labeled and cool
because we're uh you know
this is a video you want to apply we've
already sort of learned what kinds of
foods
are healthy foods that you want to be
eating to promote fat loss but here
we actually have examples like this is
not the diet
you don't have to eat these literal
foods but just examples because you may
be thinking like okay i know healthy
foods are good
i know i have to get these macros what
the hell does that even look like like
what foods do i have to actually have to
eat that realistically approach these
macros here are some really good
recommendations just so you can look at
this and say oh
well that makes sense you'll notice it's
nothing really exotic it's just good
stuff
good food measured out to hit the macros
that you need that's it
now wrapping up this video
your meal plan can and should be a
little bit different every single day
if you work out some days and don't work
out others that's going to change your
intake right
if you are awake for longer it's
probably gonna
you're gonna require more food if you're
awake for less time you'll require less
food
if your daily energy intake is super
high or daily energy output rather super
high on a day
you're super active you probably have to
eat more food if you're not as active
you have to eat less so it's okay for
the stuff to change
but fundamentally it should have a core
similarity all of your meals come
stacked with protein they're all healthy
choices
and the macro rules and the timing rules
all follow that structure of even
protein
evenly spread meals roughly and more
carbs close to the workout
more carbs for high activity times fewer
carbs flour activity times away from the
workout
and the fats stay generally away from
the workout right
this how complicated you want to make
the meals how different do you want to
make them day to day
is your call on how complex you want
bulk meal prep to be
some people in bulk meal prep they'll
have macro listings for every single one
of their meals for the next three and a
half days or some stuff like that all
right
three and a half days of meals and they
have proteins carbs and fats for every
single meal
and their containers are labeled be one
two three like day one meal one
you know day three meal three and those
are exact macros and they portion out
the chicken and rice and all that stuff
that's totally cool
what you can also do is ultra simplify
the process and have like two or three
different types of meals
you can have a meal with like low carbs
high and higher fats
you can have a meal with moderate carbs
and moderate fats like that first one's
your
evening meal this one i just talked
about as your breakfast meal
and you can have one with low fats and
ultra high carbs those are post-workout
meals
you can make like you know four of each
and then voila you have your meals done
for multiple days it's on you how
complicated you want it
to be two things one you can make it
complicated and that's totally fine
and thing too is you don't have to make
it complicated that's also totally fine
so if you're a perfectionist you're a
precision person by all means have that
if you just want to get this done you
don't want to make things complex
don't you could literally eat the same
size meal or two or three different
versions and you're totally good to
go right next time we finish this
preparatory process
of how to arrange just so far we're
arranging the diet to be
ready to really meat and potatoes lose
the fat now mind you because you're
eating to hunger and you're eating way
higher quality foods
you probably have lost a bunch of fat
already sort of unintentionally which is
great
but in this next video we have coming up
we're going to finish designing the diet
the videos after that are going to be
taking what we have
really fine-tuned diet and starting to
manipulate it to actually accomplish
what i can call like sort of forced fat
loss see you next time for the next
video
you
