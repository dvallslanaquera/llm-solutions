in progress baby it's time to start
weekly q a bi-weekly q a dr james dr
mike how's it going
good how are you james
good rp legal is in town so i'm walking
on eggshells not to get seen anything
stupid to get yourself sued out of your
mind no uh there uh
our friend toomes and his family's here
it's great we're having a grand old time
what was the uh how is his daughter with
the dogs
she is pretty good she's good with the
dogs like she'll just forearm the fuck
out of them out of the way because the
dogs love her so they'll start like
sniffing and nudging her and she's like
fuck outta here fuck out of here she's
good about it because my dogs are
overwhelming at times but she's really
interested in low the cat
and
he's kind of like i'm not sure about you
yet but she always wants to like yeah
so she's having a good time with all the
animals
adorable yes absolutely
speaking of animals oh that's a good
segue let's go to our first question ask
her
and he that you guys name me is ashton
yes that is fluent brazilian
all right
ashton
what it do doc
heard up word up
just
despite applying a large amount of
skepticism i seem to get my best
stimulus to fatigue ratios working with
very high reps in reserve and
consequently adding many more sets slash
volume
working very far from failure i get way
better pumps soreness and i've realized
most
remote growth it also seems to be the
only way i can hit any muscle local mrv
before hitting a wall of systemic
fatigue i know i'm training far from
your recommended rer targets at four to
zero maybe more around eight plus these
motherfuckers got the best genetics
i think my mind muscle uh my muscle form
and other training aspects of sound but
i still wonder if this means i'm leaving
gains
on the table or is there a good reason i
could lie outside the targets a very
slow twitch question mark so there may
be some reasons we don't really know
what they are my best investment is the
following if you're really actually
getting your best sfrs at these and your
actual gains as far as repetition
strength in your main lift and visible
muscle thighs
are really good i would say that run it
for a while and if it keeps being good
keep running it
and then if it ever stops being good try
to train with a lower rar and try to
train like marginally lower like don't
go all the way to zero right away but
instead of training it around eight pry
around five uh just push gonna reach
that a little bit further and
see if that actually gets you better
results and if it doesn't and if you go
back to around eight and you get better
growth again and better sfrs again and
etc then i think you're just uh you know
like you get your best gains where you
get your best gains so i would say
the only thing i would tell you not to
do is just assume you have the correct
answer and continue on forward and then
the years later realize that when you
tried to push it further you actually
got even better gains we won't want you
to do that um specifically you also have
to realize that
when you go closer to failure you have
to drop your volume because the systemic
fatigue and local fatigue is going to be
higher so as long as you're keeping your
volume really really in check
monitoring your recovery
and then lowering your rir which usually
means adding no sets are actually
reducing total sets from your workout
and that still doesn't work as well like
you're clearly within mrv for most of
the meso
but then your stomach fatigue is really
high your mind muscle connection sucks
you're not getting as sore which would
be really curious um then i would say
yeah going back to a lower rars is
probably the best way to go about it
james yeah i'm glad you brought up the
volume issue because training outside of
between you know four and zero rars
unfortunately like uh comparing apples
to orange's situation where the volumes
that you're doing at that point are just
not reflective of what you would be
doing if you were training with a little
uh closer to failure so it's really hard
to make intelligent program design
decisions when it's kind of outside that
zone so my guess
this is just a shot in the dark is that
you're probably
more in that mev range now than you were
in your previous training and you were
probably just maybe exceeding your mrvs
either systemically or locally when you
were training closer to failure so i i
hate to say like if i mean if you're
getting good gains if you're if you're
making good progress it's it's kind of
hard to justify changing what you're
doing
but i would say at some point maybe go
back to the drawing board
flirt with some of those lower rir
numbers and maybe adjust your volumes
down and see if you can find yourself in
a better place my guess is like you're
hitting mevs now and you weren't and you
were overshooting your mrvs before that
would be my guess
yeah and that's my guess
all right next up is just shane
just shane
shane
i'm gonna ask questions forever 32
upvotes that's pretty good
that is not shabby shane
um
shane i'm just going to call you out
right now oh no say at the bottom edit
these will all be straight sets i mean
there's really no place for homophobia
here so
can you just like not
zinger
got him right so
chain asks within a workout is it better
to do body parts grouped together or
separated for example if i was doing
chest and back in the same workout would
it be more optimal to do bent first then
flies than rows then let poles or would
it be better to do bent press than rows
than flies than lat pull downs
thanks docs for all the knowledge edit
these would all be straight sets not
super sets uh good at it very good to
specify so we actually have a pretty
detailed conversation about this in our
scientific principles of pertinent
training
book
and um
this is where it gets kind of
interesting
so you're gonna have to make a trade-off
between local and systemic fatigue
if you train all of your muscle groups
let's say you train chest and back and
you're training all of chest first and
then all of back
so you can ask the qual ask the question
of what is the quality of the chest work
it's going to be done
well the quality is pretty good because
exercise number one is chest
and then exercise number two you're a
little bit more systemically fatigued
but also you're very locally fatigued
and local fatigue does have a
contribution to hypertrophy where
systemic fatigue does not
so the chest gets hit pretty well
now let's say instead we were to take
that second chest exercise let's say
flies
and put it third in the workout instead
of second because we do pull ups or
something in between and hit up back
well then what ends up happening is for
that set of flies
your systemic fatigue is now not just
from bench press but also from the
pull-ups or pull-downs
and then you have to get flies and by
then some of the local fatigue is
flushed out of your muscles for your
intestine your triceps and whatnot
specifically for your chest in this case
and so the local fatigue to the chest is
not as high but the systemic fatigue is
pretty high so you just feel generally
more tired so i would say this has a
chance of actually giving you less of a
good chest workout
uh but on the other hand
uh you know if the local fatigue is
reduced maybe you can push your muscle
muscles further
so i would say for answer number one it
doesn't matter much matter
uh which which way you do it
answer number two is it's been pretty
clear that
uh i've tried this about a trillion
times a bunch of clients you actually
get less sore if you split up your
volume within the workout
then if you all do it adjacently so if
you do back back back chest chest chest
your back gets more sore than if you do
back chest back chest back
uh and to me that actually is indicating
that the muscles are more perturbed and
disrupted with adjacent exercises than
exercises that are split up and then i
would say it's probably a good idea for
that reason alone to suspect that maybe
adjacent training is better now the
easier to talk to that is if you split
up your creating
uh and put some muscles in between it
you actually end up having a higher
performance level so if you do whatever
you do on flies
if you do
pull pull-ups before and then split the
flies and the pull-ups then you might
actually do a little bit better on flies
because you had a break now you might
not because the systemic fatigue from
the pull-ups is quite high and then if
you perform the same you're actually
performing the same but the source of
the difference in performance is now
more systemic fatigue than local fatigue
and then you're not actually doing as
good of a workout so i would say here's
my policy
i would say usually you want uh to
sandwich everything together so chest
chest back back
unless
when you un-sandwich it and mix it up
the performance of chest and back
skyrockets much more than if you
sandwiched it
then we're willing to make the trade-off
of systemic to local fatigue because the
performance is so much better because
you just imposed so much more attention
and probably drive progress for them so
if for you
splitting them up or sandwiching them
together causes roughly the same average
performance i would say sandwich them
together is good because then you
probably get the metabolic demonstration
you probably get a high ratio of local
fatigue to stomach fatigue and remember
that's a good thing because local
fatigue actually causes growth systemic
fatigue
but you get much better performances
taking some time of one or two exercises
away from a muscle and coming back to it
then i think there's a compelling case
for you to uh actually do
here here's a really good example if you
squat and then you leg press you may leg
press 400 pounds for sets of 10. okay
if you squat and then do leg curls and
then leg press
if you can leg press and you still get
400 for sets of 10 but your pump's not
as good because you lost it from squats
just do leg press after squats next time
but if you do hamstring curls between
squats and leg press and you're now leg
pressing 400 for sets of 15 because
you're so fresh yeah you know like it's
either about the same or it's actually
better to stick your hamstrings in
between there so we're going off of pump
we're going off the soreness and we're
going off performance kind of like
always so it's really just james i
should have cut myself off and just said
sfr but uh you know that's a bullshit
cop-out because sfr is pretty much the
answer anyway but just kind of
demonstrating how that works out uh dave
what do you think
it's not a cop-out because that's
exactly why we work on things like that
so we can have a go-to answer for these
type of questions but yeah you nailed it
i think like the big difference here um
where you might choose to do one or the
other as as mike already said
the importance of the intensity of the
exercise or you could phrased another
way you could say like the performance
and so for you know physique purposes it
seems like it's better as mike already
outlined to kind of clump everything
together and just like you're doing
chest until chest is done and then you
can move on to other stuff but in sport
performance it might actually be
somewhat beneficial to break them up a
little bit in the training right because
we want to maintain a really high
intensity meaning like the amount of
weight you can use or the amount of
explosivity that you can
implement into your movement etc that's
like an incentive to actually maybe
break them up just a little bit so you
can keep that intensity really high but
as we know in bodybuilding training
there are some other trade-offs going in
a different direction and maybe it's not
worth it so that would be like one of
the few instances i said if you were
like a strength sports athlete or you
know doing more sport training in
general that might be an incentive to
split them up like that but if you're
doing hypertrophy training put them all
together
all right
next up is
oh i believe his name is lucas
oh wait i think i found a different
lucas there we go
got
him lucas bomas says hi docs i was
wondering
how someone should plan around the gym
being closed for a day in your training
plan for example in a six workouts a
week if the gym is closed in the workout
five she split it in half and add it to
work out four and six or is there a more
efficient approach also if you guys
should make a compilation of mike
rumbling around so i can laugh my ass
off
rumbling around i don't know is that
like a like rumbling around with some
guys having some locker room fun yeah i
always love guys slapping around let me
just rumble it around
be your ass i'm not
i'm not
gay look it's 20 21 everyone's cool but
look let me just see it let me see your
dick let me see your dick in the locker
room is that we have mine
yeah i'm not sure what he was going for
there on that one i love locker rooms oh
my parole officer says i'm not allowed
to say i love female locker rooms
anymore after the incident right which
we will not talk about i mean remember
rp legal is here so
xna on the locker room talk um
yeah i'm so i'm guessing he means this
is like an acute thing right like the
gym is closed once not like chronically
because at that point you've just
changed your schedule around
yeah
so so i have a decent answer for this
james let me know if we think so i think
it really kind of depends on when you
find out about this quality you can find
out about this closure at the beginning
of the week you can structure the rest
of your week to make sure that you um
you know train like the early muscle
groups a little easier so you can train
them again before the off day and then
you know after you just do whatever you
had after anyway on the other hand if
you find out like the day of or the day
before well it's not a good idea to
train like you know let's say thursday
the gym closes unexpectedly
friday day five right friday closes if
you if you're coming in thursday and you
find out about this you say well fuck
i'm supposed to do back on friday but
i'll just do back now well your back
might not be healed right now right and
you just get a shitty workout so you
have to assess like am i healed to do
the exercises i would normally do on
this fifth day if i'm healed then i
sprinkle in a few of them here at the
end of my workout than i normally do get
a little bit of maintenance following
work on my technique a bit
uh and then the next you know day like
with a saturday or whatever you come in
and you do a normal workout
alternatively you could say you know
what i can do is uh i'm not healed today
on thursday so i'll just do my normal
thursday work i'm not gonna add any
friday shit in what i'm gonna do come in
saturday is i'm going to split at 50 50
a little bit of what i was supposed to
do on friday a little bit of what i'm
supposed to do on saturday go really
high on the intensity keep the volume
low so that i can still recover and do a
good job and then you kind of get like
sort of you know a mix 50 50 approach um
again the right answer to that is are
you recovered and when did you find out
about this apparently i will say i'll
throw out this idea um man you know you
can just uh
move your muscles around at home and do
some like at home training and just do a
technique slash
super light uh second that lets you
practice technique and recover a little
better eat sleep a lot that day and
honestly one missed day of training in
the gym means almost nothing
i wouldn't get too concerned about it
but basically those are kind of the
three options james
yeah i'll throw a couple more in the mix
here you can like go train somewhere
else you might have to pay a few bucks
but like man that's brilliant
i was so into this the ultimate out of
the box thinking right there i was like
well you only have one gym ever
there's only one gym and it's closed
lucas sounds like he's from like italy
or something motherfucker there might
only be one gym of all of italy so yeah
uh yeah maybe your friend has like a
garage gym that you can pop into here's
kind of my thing um
as mike was saying right at the end
there missing one day is really such so
inconsequential so unless you're someone
who is
you know
teetering on that professional athlete
spectrum if you're just a recreational
person like like like i am right i'm not
trying to shoot shit on anyone for that
if you're just a recreational person
dude it doesn't matter just miss a day
and pick up where you left off i know
it's annoying when you have like okay i
always do this workout on monday and
this workout on wednesday and that
throws off your schedule a little bit
but
you know you just reset and keep going
and if you if you have like an extra
rest day thrown in there like it's only
really in your benefit at that point
aside from your schedule getting a
little bit off so me personally i would
just say like if it's not
really important to you or your career
like
just
miss the day pick up where you left off
and don't be too fussy about it because
then the problem that you run into too
is like if you you can split up some of
those workouts be like okay i'm gonna do
some of my friday stuff and then some of
my normal saturday stuff and it's like
okay but now everything at the back end
like the saturday stuff is going to be a
little bit off because you added more on
the front end so it's like
for me i'd rather just have the
consistency of like okay well this is
the normal training session that i would
do even though now it's on a different
day and that kind of sucks but it's oh
well whatever you know you'll your body
will readjust and you move on with a new
schedule at that point
yeah excellent excellent phrase
it's it's a matter of like uh it
admitting there are constraints on the
navigating within the constraints as
opposed to admitting nothing and saying
well i can still like get as good of a
result by skipping a day we actually
can't so yeah there's other options too
and then like if you're really hardcore
come in once to the gym thursday morning
and then third thursday night you know
that's what i'm coming into your friday
workout you know like uh
again the systemic fatigue cost is going
to be very high you probably won't have
the greatest workout ever but if you
lighten the loads and go a little closer
to failure do some tablet stuff probably
get a really good workout anyway but
that's much more advanced um
you can do the same thing saturday
saturday morning you do friday workout
and then saturday afternoon or evening
you do your saturday normal workout
again these all come with trade-offs but
uh yeah that's kind of
um i had another point on there that i
wanted i was going to laugh about but i
forgot it as i was i was listening maybe
it'll come back but uh
what was i going to say
fuck
oh well let me know if it comes back
yeah make less
sorry yeah no i and just for reference i
have clients who do this kind of stuff
all the time where they'll say like oh i
missed my like week two day three
workout should i just start week two
over again i'm like no just just do it
the next time you can do it like it
doesn't it really doesn't matter like it
just yeah it throws your schedule off a
little bit but this happens with my
clients all the time where they're like
dude should we just start the whole meso
over because i missed
no just keep going it doesn't matter at
all
sorry okay who are we looking at
we are looking to make less ogre make
less
make less is two separate words
ogor
all right
question about progression if i'm in the
middle of my meso i'm trying to figure
out what is best
or whether it really matters
that is not a uh complete sentence
clearly we have a euro guy on our hands
we gotta pick it yet uh so like in
germany is that no reason for complete
sentence because we are
i'm just kidding agora i mean actually
your name looks turkish to me if i had
to make a guess but
i don't have a good go-to turkish accent
so it sounds like we're trying to figure
out like he's making a change in the
middle of his mezzo and he's trying to
figure out the best path here
yeah let's see i am doing 10 to 20 rep
range
uh for most of this mezzo when
progressing i'm using 15 as my trigger
to drop weight and plenty of my trigger
to increase okay if i can't get 15 reps
i drop the weight for the next set is it
better to stay at a weight even though i
end up doing fewer reps or should i be
dropping to keep the volume up and stay
within my med
so actually uh you know so first big
answer is it gets 90 just doesn't
fucking matter as long as you get high
quality sets in the rap can fall like
games that i always say as long as you
have at least five repetitions perfect
it's probably very hypertrophic because
then you can imagine all five of them
are very close to failure they drive a
lot of metabolic points
now
that is modified that 90 is plus and
minus all the way from 80 to about 100
is based on what your sfr is telling you
similar to the peak ratio
if you have
practiced these exercises not dropping
the weight or raising the weight like
you're just like okay i started 18 reps
and my set number five i'm at nine reps
percent and you get amazing pumps
amazing soreness amazing tension through
the muscle amazing uh you know
perturbation your muscles feel weak and
fucked up
and you're getting great progress then
shit you know like that seems like a
really good answer but you can also try
to do it say okay i try to hit 16 reps
on my first and if i get below 15 i drop
the weight or if i go you know above 20
i increase the weight and then you your
all your set cluster right between 15
and 20. by the way is not 10 to 20 like
you said but i'm just being big at this
point so if it's all 15 to 20 reps
then then you do that for some number of
weeks that strategy for a master cycle
or two you try to see where your best
sfr is and then it might actually even
depend on the exercise so for me
i'm doing pushing movements for example
um my reps drop every set i do with
lower reps actually feels kind of a
little bit better if i if i do drop sets
on my chest um or down sets rather that
like a set of 15 that i lower the weight
and it's a set of 15 i lower the weight
at some point i just get really quickly
into junk volume or i'm like doing a set
of 15 or 200 pounds or i start at 300
i'm like this is dumb as rocks like i'm
just like getting tired because
nothing's happening here um but if i'm
down to sets of seven or eight or nine
that's still at the same heavy ass
weight i was doing it for set of 15 on
my first one man every set is fucking
gold on the other hand for me for my leg
lat pull downs or assisted pull-ups when
they drop below like 10 reps i think
this doesn't really matter i just don't
it's not that great stimulus 50 ratio is
not that great i feel like i'm moving
around so that's not long enough for me
to really catch a pump or get a lot of
tablets and i get off and i'm like i
don't know that was fun i was okay and
if i actually decrease the weight and do
another set of 12 or 15 my lats burn
right off my fucking body huge pump and
i'm like oh my fuck god so it actually
is quite uh dependent on the movement
quite dependent on the muscle and
remember both are generally correct
answers as long as your sets don't drop
below about five reps per set and then
within that okay say generally both are
correct that's good which one do i pick
it really just comes down to per the
movement per the exercise per your phase
what it which one gives you the best
stimulus to fatigue ratio and that you
can figure out in just a couple sessions
you know one second adjust wait one
second don't just wait and see what
happens see which that one's better of
course you have a big air chance there
but you repeat that process in other two
sessions and if the same answer is you
get the same answer go yeah clearly drop
the weight is better and that's probably
what we should be doing for the
foreseeable future
and then if you still can't tell well
then it's back to that ninety percent it
doesn't fucking matter either way is
good you know like can you can you
imagine and tell someone like okay we
can do a set of twelve on the squats for
this fourth set or we can do a set of
eight which one's gonna really fuck you
up you're like i don't know like i feel
like the weight fucked me on one and the
reps fuck me on the other getting fucked
either way so if it's all the same to
you it's all the same to you it all
works really well
yeah absolutely and agora i do like kind
of your thought process here of like
this is basically a way of auto
regulating your your weight progression
right or a reduction in this case so i
think kind of the top end idea is good
right so if you're getting like 20 on
your first set that means next week
that's probably a good time to increase
the weight a little bit keep you in the
range right though i don't think that
using 15
as kind of like a reduction
criteria is necessarily warranted i mean
you could literally just if you got like
12 on your first set but your goal was
10 to 20
you could just focus on increasing your
reps at the same weight week to week and
that would be a fine progression and you
wouldn't necessarily have to
reduce the weight to get the repetitions
up a little bit because by week two you
might do the same weight and now you're
doing 14 reps week three now you're
doing 15 or 16 reps and that's a
perfectly fine way of doing it though i
do think like using that top end is a
good idea i just think you're being
maybe too rigid on that bottom end and
then like mike said ultimately the sfr
really should be dictating the
directionality of your training but you
don't need to like put these you know
like a a constraint of like five reps
plus or minus uh in there i think it's
just a little too rigid for reducing the
weight
yeah i agreed
all right
exactly
just really quickly wrote down on
a video i'm gonna make on a related
topic
based um i tell you what i get a lot of
video ideas just based on answering
questions yeah for sure
all right next up is a
a-r-d-i-s-h r-dish
got it
all right so ardish asked what does it
mean if i was progressing on all sets
for an exercise but now i'm only
progressing on the first side of the
exercise for example at the end of mezzo
one i did 120 pounds for eight six five
reps all zero rar
max mezzo i did 125 for eight thick five
reps all zero ir next i did 130 pounds
for eight
four rep
at a zero uh plus a back offset so i
would say
you're um coming up into something quite
interesting or quite predictable over
the long term
your
uh every set as your muscles get bigger
and stronger relative to the size of
your systemic support system
cardiovascular system nervous system
liver and heart processing byproducts
things like that
you take a bigger systemic hit from
every single working set including your
first one so again someone does uh let's
say they have been in the gym for six
months their max squat is for 10 is is
100 pounds they grind 10 to the fucking
bone and somebody has to peel them out
of it
rep number 11 goes only halfway up you
know about like two minutes later
they're like i feel quite fine and i can
probably do another set of nine like if
you
fast forward that person with incredible
genetics to where they're doing 500 for
10 like i tell you what i've done 500
percent it's on youtube did it ibar and
after that i rested roughly 15 minutes
and then my next set was like five and
then i did three after another 10
minutes of rest and i was like i'm i'm
done i typically can't squat anywhere
remotely near my 10rm anymore because
the systemic fatigue was just unreal so
yeah you're getting stronger and that
means your reps are going to start
dropping off on them later sets and
that's totally fine um
like
one popular way of training for larger
folks i'm not a big fan of it as a
dogmatic thing but i think it has its
applications is one top set one drop set
for an exercise so they'll do it like
one big chat of like say eight or twelve
and leg press and then they reduce the
weight and do another set of either h12
or something like 20 you say why don't
they do another set of eight well
actually their set was pretty close to
failure so at that same weight they
might be able to do like three
and then it's below five and it's
pointless so you're just running into
that the idea that systemic and even
local fatigue is just way higher you get
way more disrupted and perturbed uh you
know et cetera you basically just get
real fucked up from any one given set so
you're not able to just do like you know
888 one thing as funny as a lot of um
my instagram followers uh get on people
like they're asking these questions i
try to remind folks that everyone a lot
of people are new and ask questions like
this all the time but when i post my my
reps and it's like you know ten eight
seven someone's like why don't you do 10
10 10 and they're like you can't do 10
10 minutes you're very hard it's
impossible well it's much closer to
possible if you're a beginner and not so
strong if you get really really strong
gee you know you really only have one
top set in you and the max has to be
less weight otherwise you do like a rep
so uh james did i miss anything on that
no that was really good and uh artis
this is one of the reasons why we bias
our performance monitoring towards the
first set because the first set
represents you and your like best state
right
and everything after that you can you
can look at it it's just less meaningful
in terms of like what what state am i in
so when you're when your most fresh and
capable set is on point or better than
it was the last couple of times you're
doing good and whatever happens after
that can be a result of like um like as
mike was saying like um the systemic
fatigue of you hitting that new effort
so like one of the things that we um
used to tell our athletes was like if
they hit a pr during the meza cycle like
don't expect anything else to happen if
you uh for the rest of that meso on that
particular exercise because more often
than not if we had someone let's say
they had like a four week mezzo and they
hit a squat pr in like week three and
they're super stoked and you're like wow
that's great just keep in mind like next
time you train legs might not be so good
because the fatigue from hitting that pr
is going to be worse than you might
think than right now and so that same
thing applies within a set so you hit uh
you know something that you've maybe
never hit before or like a a a
relatively local best effort for a long
time that takes a lot out of your
muscles takes a lot out of you
systemically so whatever happens after
that it's kind of like
as long as that first set was good to go
you're probably on the right track and
then if like um
in this case he said okay i did eight
and then four and then you might be like
okay well i've listened to mike and
james i've read hypertrophy book and
less than five reps is probably not
great so then at that point if you still
need some volume you might do a few back
off sets right and break off of your
normal routine a little bit and that
would be perfectly fine
yeah
yeah very good very outside
next up is a gentleman named dressle
bread i suppose maybe not a gentleman
i've misgendered
me early wrestle bread he's got like a
weird pink owl thing puppet i don't know
i don't like that thing i don't think it
belongs in our society it looks like an
owl like fused with a peep
something melissa davis would eat yeah
well good that somebody would eat it
because i don't want to have like civil
rights and shit and
it disturbs me
all right
hey docs when training the same muscle
group twice a week heavy and light am i
supposed to progress through our arch
zero are on both sections or should i
eventually hit failure on only one of
them while keeping the other two rr
any different sound that applies to
cutting and bulking yes
so generally in hypertrophy training
there is not a huge place for what we
call technique oriented or light work
and then when we say light training for
hypertrophy we actually mean just a
smaller potential vulnerabax which just
gives you more reps and generally
speaking unless again if we if we get
into real specifics in some context you
could have a good reason for not pushing
rars the same but generally speaking 90
of the answer is oh yeah if it's a three
r week you sort of take everything to
roughly three rar and if it's the zero r
week everything kind of goes to zero ir
um so my answer to that is no you
shouldn't just keep the other irish i
think uh generally cutting and bulking
and maintaining the rer is better on
average structured through the week not
just through individual seconds unless
again you have a compelling reason to do
so and if you can't think of a
compelling reason
it's probably not a very compelling
reason right
uh and then he says
just attempt to insult us
so your channel has been extremely
helpful it's one of a kind i wish i
found you eight years ago when i was
starting out thank you for the quality
information provided you know eight
years ago i wasn't providing a whole lot
of quality information but uh professor
brad i wish i found you when we were
mere children and we could hold hands
and laugh and run through
meadows but but here's a very specific
caveat meadows with hills because i
really like hills the grass should be
tall but not too tall and also here's a
problem james that i think you and i
need to focus on for a few minutes
people running through the meadows
especially with flowers is a real
beautiful thing think about how many
fucking vile bugs are in that fucking
grass jamo
yeah not to mention russell crowe
gladiator is gonna fuck you up you're
like i'm having a great time he's over
there too and his family farm is right
there he's gonna fucking kill you so now
you're covered in bugs and you got angry
russell crowe
fuck that get out of here dress up i'm
glad we've never met you this situation
sucks
you and your friend who has fucked up
eyes
no but not serious though james what do
you think yeah um so i i don't know
for hypertrophy training specifically i
don't know of any compelling reasons to
undulate the rir within the week it
always seems that like if it's a 3r week
you just that's just a blanket across
the board i i can i can think of
instances in sport training where you
might have some like distinctly light er
sessions for some things where you would
really want to back off hard
um
but that's more of a kind of a niche
situation of fatigue management for
bodybuilding and hypertrophy training i
really don't think that that would be
useful so there's really no big i can't
think of an incentive to do it that way
that couldn't be corrected through
modulating your volume landmarks and
things like that so
yeah
all right next up is a-r-o-n
a-ron
hate we run
are you a ron got it hey ron good
[Music]
he has a beautiful little little profile
picture and we'll add that
snap just got some abs going young gym
boys take selfies
that sounds like a good instagram uh
handle young gym boys
b-o-i-s
what
hi docs my daily activity little can
vary quite a bit sometimes i work from
home sometimes from the office meaning a
thick mild commute by bicycle
facility transmission
which could occur every
day
a couple of days or zero days in a given
week with no way to know in advance so
it's difficult to set a standard calorie
goal to hate each day 2500 might be
surplus one day or deficit to the next
is it better to try to stick with a
rough average as best as i can yes or
use something like an activity tracker
to determine daily calorie goals well
here's the thing man you're gonna prep
your meals the day before and your boss
is going to call you that night or the
morning off and be like hey we need you
at work you're going to be like
i need to like add lucky charm to my
deals or something like that so i
honestly like i think james and i have a
policy of unless you have a predictable
situation or unless you're a performance
athlete who actually needs more fuel on
those days
like okay
if you're cycling to work cycling back
then you have to train you probably have
some more carbs to fill up your legs
with glycogen through the days that you
don't have a kitty workout outside
especially different stuff like that i
think
variations of daily expenditure are just
going to be a thing you got a weekly
average from another reason going back
to last week's podcast why james and i
are really big i'm not trying to be like
oh yeah it only needs a 40 calorie a day
surplus like motherfucker you could walk
to the fridge at night two extra times
and there's 40 calories
there's no way to keep track of that
even with a fitness tracker which is an
error rate of like at least 10 percent
it already takes you out of the ball
game so yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't sweat
it unless it's one of those things where
you have like a big workout and uh you
need the energy and you know that if you
don't beat your normal but your rider up
around the fucking bike six mile commute
then you're not gonna have it then yeah
then late towards the end of that day
you should have some more carbs
yeah i agree with mike here the using
the averages is a good idea and it's
really probably not a big deal um the
the one situation where you might choose
to make some changes is if you're having
like really wild weight fluctuations
because your activity varies so much day
to day and it's kind of screwing up your
body weight goals and in that case what
you might do
something really basic is just use like
an activity tracker like a step counter
and just standardize your activity for
every day to the best of your abilities
so use something like 10 000 steps and
say okay i'm going to try and hit 10 000
steps every day so if i you know walk or
ride my bike to work that'll take up a
big chunk of that and then the rest of
the day i don't really have to do much
or if it's a day where i'm working from
home on zoom i have to make an effort to
move around a bit more and be a little
bit more active and that's just like a
kind of a superficial level something
again like mike said the error rate is
massive on those things but if it is so
wildly fluctuating your average weekly
calories might kind of get goofy at some
in those calculations so at that point
like standardizing your activity using
something like a step counter might be
helpful
for sure and i always used to have
counter standardized activity but even
that is like either i set myself a
minimum daily goal or even that's
average through the week
yeah yeah
so it's hard when you when you don't
have a consistent schedule to make a lot
of training and dietary choices so at
that point you just kind of have to do
the best that you can and maybe use some
averages like mike already said
all right
next up is
yo
joel phillips oh right there easy peasy
awesome
all right joel said hey docs if i train
before bed what would be the optimal
form of approaching to consume
post-workout faster just need to quickly
increase muscle protein synthesis or
slow adjusting to last the night
thanks joel i would say the easy cop-out
answer is a moderate digesting protein
like any meat um uh kind of hits both uh
things another thing you can do is
uh like on the way home from your
workout slam a casein and carb shake and
then when you get home have a slow
digesting protein so through the juice
fiberholic bases i think it's probably
the best answer of the two the float
adjusting in this case means like you
know you have some meat and some rice
and then you finish off the meal with
like some berries and a good load of
greek yogurt you know like that really
does cover all your bases right there
um i also say it doesn't really matter
much the only way it can really matter
is if you like have a casein i'm sorry i
have a weighted gatorade shake and then
just go to sleep you might actually wake
up rebound hypoglycemic two hours later
so i would say the best answer is what i
just said
fast right after or slow shortly after
after you take an hour and have your
last meal so shake and solve that
problem which is one of the great ways
that a shake can be beneficial the next
best answer is just a whole food
advertising protein if you don't want
them for thinking all the time james
yeah absolutely and the thing is like
you're going to be going to bed anyway
so you're basically like going into
anabolism mode so like i don't i don't
feel like there's necessarily a huge
incentive for the fast digesting protein
here maybe the carbohydrate especially
if you're going to like train in the
evening today and then tomorrow you're
training in the morning then you might
make a case and say like well actually
maybe you want to get some high glycemic
carbs in you so you can get that going
and then maybe have your slow digesting
stuff right before bed but either way i
feel like just having a whole food meal
here that the differences are going to
be so
marginally small like it doesn't really
matter
yeah
all right
next up is andrew spelled really weird
but just start smiling andrew and he'll
come up okay
andrew atkinson
no we're gonna come later oh andrew
andre you
says hi ducks
how would you recommend getting back
into hypertrophic training after an
extended time off no training at all for
a
yeah this is when we get pretty pretty
regularly
we do get it regularly i s
swear to god i hold on um i think you
made a youtube video about this too man
i got i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
search my files here real quick to see
if we have a video i know it's have you
ever made it or let's see
coming back fine
no okay
what about coming
new games explained
cultural recovery
understanding that everyone is coming
from a different place
oh that's in a future video series
called happiness tips that's lame as
fuck
strong man training
uh recommended youtube videos
okay wow i just yeah i'm gonna add that
right now so hold please and
yeah so i'll kind of to get the ball
rolling here i'll make make some notes
um so typically when you've done no
training at all the first thing you do
is throw away all the other mesos that
you did in the past don't even look at
them don't reference them because you're
starting over and that's perfectly fine
typically what we would do is a little
bit of a kind of a trial and error
period for a couple weeks maybe before
starting an actual meza cycle of
training so what most people do is
they're like i'm ready to get back to
training let's hit it baby gonna fuck
some shit up and what happens they fuck
some shit up all right but in all the
wrong ways because they come in too hard
too fast so this is a good time to start
thinking about like what are some good
sfr movements for me do i need to
reevaluate my technique like has my
technique been kind of wonky on some
exercises and can i start setting a new
baseline so typically what we'd
recommend is something really light and
easy just for a couple weeks kind of
like a we what we would call like a
return to fitness and sport training
which is like i'm just going to maybe
train three or four times a week really
really easy stuff really working on my
technique kind of thinking figuring out
which exercises i want to start
including in the upcoming measures of
training reinforcing the technique on
those movements with relatively
lightweight maybe working up to one or
two kind of sets at a relatively low rar
something like five or six all right are
seeing how it goes getting a lot of
feelers out there before actually
starting a mezzo of training so you do
that for maybe like two weeks of just
like relatively easygoing stuff mostly
technique focus maybe one or two kind of
quote-unquote hard sets at like five to
six rer you know maybe around 10-ish
reps or so and then you might transition
into an actual mesocycle where you start
having some more distinct maybe volume
and or load progressions but they're
going to be
light years away from whatever you
finished off doing before you stopped
training so if you said okay my mrv for
biceps was 24 sets like just throw that
out the window just say like why don't
we just start off trying to get up to
like eight or ten sets this week see
where that goes and then after that it's
kind of a measure a matter of slow auto
regulation because you might return to
fitness relatively quickly and you might
kind of look at some of the auto
regulation stuff and be like okay well i
did 10 this week why don't i just jump
up to 18 the next week like
resist the urge to do that kind of stuff
say like i did 10. let's try 13 see how
that goes okay 13 was pretty good
getting good pumps not really sore yet
why don't we bump it up to like 15 or 16
and kind of that kind of slow
progression and then you might find
after the first mesocycle you kind of
maybe undershot what you could have done
good problem to have because the
opposite direction often puts you back
further into more no training for a
longer period of time so kind of start
conservatively uh with like a return to
fitness maybe an easy mesocycle and then
ramp up and auto regulate little by
little as you go and then with after
like three or four mesos you're probably
getting pretty close to what you had
been doing previously maybe not exactly
the same but you're getting there in
terms of sets and uh and weights being
used
yo
yeah very good stuff
anything you want to throw in there
i miss anything
start really easy
and only progress
when the stimulus is insufficient and
you may be surprised that for weeks and
weeks and weeks you can use very light
weights and slowly increase them very
low volumes and still get massive mega
pumps mega storms meg everything you're
remaking noob gains again so just shut
up and make those gains i think people
really don't like the fact that they're
lifting so little uh such little weights
this little volume
and they're like well i just hit all my
fucking
check marks for hitting a good workout
and they're like okay and they're like
so keep going like no
you keep going and that's precisely how
a lot of injuries happen is that you're
on a custom then you try to do your old
shit and you get hurt so
take the
you you bad news you lost the muscle
good news it's really easy to get it
back and you're not gonna have to work
that hard for it what you're gonna have
to work hard for is getting new muscle
after which you're gonna have to work
hard for anyway to let the easy phase
come by for two or three months and then
once you're back to your old strength
and all that stuff you'll be like oh
it's just normal training
absolutely
all right
um
second to no last our last one for the
day is lorenzo
vrolic oh no lorenzo
no relation to loretta always always
gets us on this tangent yeah
so lorenzo asks
rather i don't feel my biceps when i do
curls or pulls in order they get sore
but i do feel my brachialis
and brachioradialis which i do get very
sore my biceps appear to be lagging
behind as well how can i modify basic
curling exercises to hit the biceps in a
more optimal manner first answer is you
may not have to do basic
um curling exercises
you might have to use some different
curling exercises that are not basic
some ones that i would recommend offhand
that tend to work pretty well for myself
installation as you cable one hand cable
in the other double cable stack you
actually just do like a front double bye
over and over okay that actually seems
to hit the biceps pretty well it's raw
stimulus magnitude usually blows dick
but its specificity to the biceps is
often higher so if you get all of your
forearm work and rolling work done pull
down work you just want to blast the
biceps at the end of a workout maybe
that's a good idea another one is uh
curls whereas you grab a dumbbell so
let's see uh let's pretend this is a
really big dumbbell handle and you got
the one dumbbell on the inside one
weight on the other side
if you grab the dumbbell here it
actually worked this way one of the
problems of the biceps is supinations
you never remember the difference
between supination and pronating this is
actually hilarious at a profoundly gay
lab ta back when i was in college that
he'd be like remember supination is like
soup you're holding a can of soup and i
was like that's fucking brilliant i
never forget it in a million years so
soup okay so holding a bowl of soup like
this if you can have a movement that
supinates
you're in a real good position so if you
have a dumbbell and most of it's
sticking out this way so if you you know
hear the handle if you grab it here not
much happens because it's not a lot of
supination but you grab it on the other
end on the far end you try to physically
bring your pinkies into the sky at the
top as you curl that can hit your biceps
a little better and one last
recommendation
is to take
your um
maybe you should do this at the end of a
chest day or something uh or at the you
know far away at the end at the end of
the chastity you're far away from the
chest day but you take um
either cables or preferably one of those
um
deck machines and you grab the handles
and instead of bending your arm you know
like roughly 135 degrees or something
like that you actually just straighten
it completely or almost completely and
that takes the tension off the packs a
lot because it makes biceps your
limiting factor what i just say biceps
your limiting factor you can actually
get fucking crazy doms on your biceps by
doing flies with almost completely or
completely straight arms and it doesn't
feel that great but you're like oh my
fucking god my biceps and it's not brax
radio bracks it's biceps um and i would
actually call that extra five kind of
like the good mooring stache looked like
a deadlift of biceps because it actually
lengthens the muscle and crosses the
shoulder joint there whereas mostly if
you do curls it's like saying to someone
hey mike i do a lot of leg curls my
hamstrings don't get big the first thing
james and i'll tell you like have you
tried hip hinging no like oh my god your
hamstrings problem is solved so this is
kind of a way to get the biceps going
like this uh and it might actually be a
big benefit another last one real quick
is uh do curls on an incline bench
preferably so you sit uh like back like
this your curls you let the arm move
really far back at the bottom and also
you can combine that because if it's
dumbbells you can combine that to where
you're holding the dumbbell on the
outside instead of inside and then
supinated curls uh matt fuck man if that
doesn't get your biceps
yeah incline curls are brutal those are
ones that i hate doing because the pain
the pain is like it's just so in the
biceps yeah and and it's humbling
because nobody's strong at it and you're
like oh man i'm weak as fuck and my
biceps are small but then they're left
last week and bigger later
yeah those are all really good um i
would just this is the really the issue
here is sfr but the the what i would
kind of want to highlight within that is
um try and find bicep movements where
you can really get a good peak
contraction and feel it in the biceps
because a lot of the times and i'm
guilty of this too like barbell curls
like for me like that's just a movement
training all right i really don't feel
that much in my biceps i'm just moving
that barbell around but something like a
cable curl or like any variation on
those incline curls or kind of spider
curls where you can really actually feel
yourself like squeezing it up hard then
you'll know that you're actually at
least doing some good bicep training in
there right if you just feel like
whatever movements you're picking you're
just basically picking it up and putting
it down and you're kind of like meh i
guess i trained my biceps we all have
movements like that for us and that's
it's an sfr issue so you might have to
play around and like mike said pick some
more advanced exercises and i would
recommend ones in which you can really
feel that peak contraction and if you
haven't given like those incline as mike
said that's a good option i always like
like cable curls is a good one for me
where you can like just sometimes you
have to schmidt yourself in a different
position some people like to be back off
of the stack i like to have my face like
right up in the stack and get that
straight downward pull and then for me
that works really good granted i have
like a weird arm length thing so i for
me i have to find ones where i really
feel the tension in my biceps sounds
like it's the same issue for you so play
around with that a little bit and make
sure you can feel that deep tension and
mind muscle connection in the movements
that you're choosing stick a stay away
from movements where you're just doing
what we would call like movement
training where you're just moving it up
and down and meh not really feeling it
james that's it
all right
well i thought for a moment we wouldn't
get it done today i was having some
technical difficulties but turns out
uninstalling zoom and reinstalling zoom
is magic folks if you ever have issues
um that's i don't really have anything
any housekeeping dr mike you got
anything you want to plug
we're finishing work on a really cool
little mini rp project that you guys
will get
always secretive is dr mike we have many
projects but we won't tell you about
them especially when rp legal is here
all right folks that was really good
thanks for the upvotes thanks for the
questions make sure you guys subscribe
to the youtube channel there's an
ungodly number of videos on there at
this point so make sure you check those
out keep asking questions and uploading
ones that you like from other people and
we will see you next time
peace
