in your last six weeks of prep doing a
hard leg session requires like something
soul sucking yeah and I'm saying my
shit's easy right now man right like
still soul sucking before the session
starts and at times during the session
just kind of thinking about what's the
objective and am I on course and then
because the objective is here and I've
accomplished this I go here I go here I
go here I go here and I just check the
box and get it done
and that's when the boxes are hard to
check
it'd be tough you know like Warrior
shit's cool let it last for a rep or two
inspiration wise music will last for a
top set but that understanding of
there's a job to be done and I'm gonna
calmly execute the job no matter what
