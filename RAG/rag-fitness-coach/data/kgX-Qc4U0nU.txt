hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and i have a quick tip for
you today isn't that nice how nice of me
to get on here using my time
youtube doesn't even pay me i had to
sell on my lamborghinis
it's just been a rough week you know do
you just want to scream
yeah in any case here's the thing
if strength training is important to you
and getting stronger is important to you
you might want to consider
on whatever rest times you usually use
biasing it towards more rest a little
longer rest may help you get stronger
not bigger bigger has a much
more fungible what's okay area
4s times stronger is
usually better on average if you wrestle
on longer why
here's the thing the way you can get
your strongest
is often by pushing your biggest
most fast twitch
muscles and motor units and muscle
fibers
in your body close to their limits
that's how you get them to grow
that's how you train the nervous system
part that innervates them and tells them
to contract
when those
huge muscle fibers and motor units that
control them are on
that's really good stuff when they're
pushed to the limits but here's the
thing
those specific fastest twitch motor
units that you have in your muscles are
absolutely the worst at recovery and
they are the last parts of your muscles
to recover so your muscles can actually
feel generally pretty good
but the recovery still isn't maximum for
the very thing you need to recover the
most
right
thus
if you rest a little bit too short
between sets you can have decent sets
but the thing that hasn't recovered yet
those big fastest twitch motor units and
muscle fibers is they're the thing you
want to recover the most
because they're the thing that actually
responds the best
it's kind of like what a good analogy
here
uh it's time to start your pickup
basketball game again after like a
two-minute break but your best player
hasn't gotten back from the bathroom yet
and you're like ah whatever let's just
start like wait hold on we want to win
the motherfucking better get back from
the bathroom then we'll start because we
really need him to be on the basketball
court for us to win because he's
obviously our best fucking player
in just a very similar way your fastest
twitch fibers they need the most time to
recover so when you're feeling pretty
good that may not be good enough so
here's the recommendation
we have our four factor rest time model
right
your
breath is back good your muscles feel
nice and strong no other muscles are
limiting factors and your target
musculature is ready to do that number
of reps again that you want
after you check those boxes and you can
uh
youtube search our four factor rest time
model and there's like we have like
eight videos about it now
after you've checked those boxes
for hypertrophy training for muscle
ghost training feel free to just go
right yeah we don't want to be in the
gym forever unless there's that one cute
guy there and then i can always be in
the gym
but
if that's the case for strength we've
checked all four of those boxes
try to give it
maybe another minute of rest after you
feel like you're really ready to go
that way
when you
clip your power lifting belt and stack
up and get on the squat bar you'll for
sure be so fucking ready that those fast
to switch motor units and the parts of
your brain connected to them are really
recovered and you can go fucking hard
because hard
very to the limit
sets are what drive strength gains
especially strength gains the best
by a launch
now does that mean you have to wait
three extra minutes after each time
you're already ready no so what is a
good idea is
try to figure out when you're ready to
go
rest a little bit longer and go after
that do that for a few weeks and then
after a few weeks try to rest a little
bit shorter than that or a little bit
longer than that okay
and see which ones give you the best
sets and the best results that are the
best for you
because at the end of the day
we want you to have the best possible
results and if that means
resting just a little bit longer 20 30
40 seconds a minute longer than normal
but getting 5 or 10 pounds every few
months more on your lifts holy shit
that's fucking worth it
