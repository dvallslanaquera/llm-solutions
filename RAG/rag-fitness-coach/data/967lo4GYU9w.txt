so does keeping continual tension on the
muscle throughout the entire set
give you a stronger muscle building
stimulus if you want to maximize muscle
growth then the truth is that
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today we're talking about the
concept of
constant tension um this is a term that
you'll hear a lot in bodybuilding
circles
which is the idea that um in order to
stimulate maximum muscle growth
you need to keep the muscle under as the
name says
constant tension throughout the entire
set so instead of lifting and lowering
the weight all the way through the
fullest range of motion possible
instead you're going to stop a bit short
at the top or bottom end of the lift
or both so that there's no point of rest
and so that the tension stays on the
muscle at all times
for example let's say on a chest press
or a shoulder press you might stop a few
inches
short of lockout rather than pressing
all the way through or on a leg press
you might leave a few inches at the top
of each rep to prevent the quads from
resting or maybe on a
free weight biceps curl you don't let
your arms fully straighten at the bottom
and you stop a bit short to keep that
full tension on the biceps you get the
general idea here
now this is a debated issue there's some
mixed research on it so what i'm giving
you here
is my personal viewpoint based on the
overall logic of muscle growth as i see
it
and on my own experience slash
observation
slash the research that i have looked at
and if you want to comment below with
your thoughts on the subject
so whether or not you think that
constant tension is important for
building muscle
uh then feel free because i'm always
interested to hear your guys feedback
uh before i jump into it if you do enjoy
my videos and you find them beneficial
then please do me one small favor and
help to maintain
constant tension on that like button
below because it really does help to
push the video out there so that even
more people can benefit from the content
i really do appreciate the support
so what i would say first and foremost
okay constant tension versus
non-constant tension completely aside
what truly truly
matters when it comes to stimulating
hypertrophy the most important factor
above
everything else is the simple fact that
you are training your muscles
close to or all the way up to their
maximum strength capacity on each
set in other words it's the simple fact
that you're training hard and getting
close to the point of muscular failure
uh regardless of the specific lifting
style that you use to get to that point
as long as you ultimately do get
yourself to the point in the set
where you're on those last few reps and
you're exerting yourself against the
weight with maximum force
and the muscle is being challenged close
to the point of failure
that is what ultimately stimulates
muscle growth and i would say to aim for
at least
three reps short of failure as a minimum
if you want to make significant gains
and ideally one to two reps short on the
bulk of your sets
and then you can also mix in some sets
all the way to complete failure here and
there as well
so whether you get yourself close to
failure using constant tension reps or
just
regular reps where the tension might
leave the muscle momentarily at certain
points in the range
or maybe the tension doesn't completely
leave but it just decreases
that is not going to make a noticeable
difference to your bottom line muscle
gains in
the long run as long as you perform a
high enough volume of total reps that
are done close to failure
and you're slowly adding more weight to
the bar over time or just using other
methods of progressive overload
your body is going to have no choice but
to adapt further and further
and you're going to continually build
new muscle mass in response to that
stress
if you strip away everything gaining
muscle
ultimately boils down to training close
to failure and then continually
challenging your muscles with a higher
and higher workload over time
so what is the actual difference between
using
constant tension reps versus
non-constant tension reps
the difference is that when you do an
exercise in that constant tension style
because the muscle never has any chance
at all to rest you know it doesn't get
that momentary
release at the top or bottom of each rep
that's going to cause a greater pooling
of blood and metabolic waste products in
the muscle and what that does is it
makes a given load more challenging and
so you'll end up reaching muscular
failure
using a lighter weight okay assuming
you're not cutting down the range of
motion significantly
and you're not just doing a bunch of
half reps or quarter reps i'm just
talking about a very small reduction
to prevent the muscle from resting and
if you think about it it's actually the
same general concept as blood flow
restriction training where you're
physically wrapping bands around your
arms or your legs to trap that blood and
those metabolites inside the muscle
and what happens when you do bfr
training okay you're able to lift a lot
less weight
and the research shows that even going
as low as 20 to 30 percent of your one
rep max
that that produces the same amount of
net muscle growth in comparison to
regular heavy sets
as long as again the key factor which is
that you train
close to failure you know with bfr
training that feeling of
tension on the muscle the pump the burn
all of that is absolutely insane if
you've ever tried it
it burns
yet it doesn't produce better muscle
growth than regular straight sets and
instead it's about the same
so what you could say is that constant
tension training
is basically like a middle ground
between regular non-constant tension
reps
and blood flow restriction training it's
kind of in between okay you're adjusting
the way that you perform the exercise in
order to make
a given load more challenging and that
causes you to reach failure more easily
with lighter loads again assuming you're
only shortening
the range slightly however as long as
the
proximity to failure is equated meaning
that if you do a
constant tension style set and you get
within one rep of failure or you do a
regular
non-constant tension set and you get
within one rep of failure or you do a
blood flow restriction set
and you get within one rep of failure
the bottom line hypertrophic response is
going to be the same
because at the end of the day all your
body really cares about
is the total percentage of that muscles
momentary resources
that are being used up you know if you
get to the point in the set where you're
using up
say 95 of what that muscle is ultimately
capable of
then it really doesn't matter how you
got there and the hypertrophic response
will be the same and we see the same
thing when comparing different rep
ranges as well
as long as you get close to failure then
low reps medium reps and high reps all
stimulate comparable hypertrophy
even though it might feel like higher
rep sets are putting more tension and
more stress on the muscle
it really just comes down to getting
close to failure period that's the
common denominator in all of this and if
we're just talking anecdotally
in my experience i would say that the
majority not all okay i know you can
find exceptions here but
i would say the majority of big strong
natural lifters that i've observed over
the past 20 years or so including myself
when i was at my biggest and strongest
maybe 10 years ago constant tension is
not something that these guys are
sitting around worrying about
they're training hard they're doing
basic compound lifts with proper form
and focusing on progressive overload
and if the tension on the muscle happens
to decrease for a brief moment at some
point in the range
it's not some sort of limiting factor
the best example that i could think of
would be
a barbell squat you know how many
lifters out there have built massive
legs with barbell squats as their
primary movement how many power lifters
out there
have massive legs and do nothing except
barbell squats yet
if you really look at it heavy barbell
squats are one of the least
constant tension movements that i can
think of you know in the top position
when you're standing upright
there's no tension on the quads at all
and you spend a longer period of time
resting in between reps compared to
other exercises because you have to
reset at the top of each rep
by breathing out taking another breath
back in and then bracing your core
before you descend back down again
and actually it's the same thing on
deadlifts too except that rest is coming
in the bottom position rather than the
top
on a barbell or dumbbell press once your
arms are straight out in front of you
your pecs are not working significantly
anymore because gravity is pulling the
weight straight down
whereas the pecs exert their force in an
arcing motion on a pull up if you
descend down all the way into a dead
hang
then your lats are going to be much less
active in that position
on a romanian deadlift there's no
tension at the very top on an overhead
barbell press
there's often a slight rest in the
bottom position depending on how you're
doing the movement
another example would be a pendlay row
where the bar
rests on the ground in between reps
these are just a few examples
yet how many guys out there have built
strong muscular
jacked physiques using these basic lifts
as their bread and butter
a lot and from what i've observed most
of the people who use this
constant tension style for whatever
reason they tend to be enhanced
bodybuilders i don't know exactly why
that is
but if you look at the way a lot of pro
bodybuilders train they very often do
this
constant tension style and then people
see that and they think well this guy is
massive and ripped and he performs his
reps in this style so i guess that's the
best way to do it without realizing that
someone who is using performance
enhancing drugs and also has top gear
genetics
they're basically going to grow insanely
well no matter what they do it's not
directly because
of the fact that they're training in
this constant tension style in practical
terms i'd say that if you're a novice
lifter then just train using the basic
lifts
with the fullest range of motion that
you comfortably can if there's a brief
moment in the lift where the tension
decreases
it's not going to hurt your gains and
then as you become more experienced
if you want to experiment a bit you know
if you find that on certain lifts
using more of a constant tension style
feels better for you for some reason
then that's fine again the most
important thing is just that you're
getting close to failure one way or the
other
i'm not saying that you shouldn't strive
to put the muscle under tension
throughout the largest overall range of
motion that you can
during an exercise that's a separate
question and it has to do with
resistance curves i'm just saying that
if the tension
momentarily leaves the muscle at the top
or bottom end of the range that you're
using
that is not a big deal the one potential
benefit of constant tension training
i would say is that it might lessen the
stress on your joints
since it allows you to get close to
failure using a lighter weight so maybe
if you have
let's say some shoulder discomfort on
chest presses and you find that by
lightening the weight a bit
and using a more constant tension style
where um you don't press all the way up
maybe you stop a few inches short
then that's fine um that might be a
perfectly valid approach for you or if
you have
lower back discomfort maybe on a leg
press you stop several inches short of
lockout that's going to help you reach
failure in your quads
but while using less of an overall load
or maybe if you have
elbow discomfort on a biceps curl maybe
you drop the weight down and you cut out
a couple inches from the top or bottom
end of the range to lessen that stress
on the elbow
as far as i can see that would be the
main practical application when it comes
to constant tension training
just like with blood flow restriction
training it's a way to get
the same net training effect but with
less weight
if you need to use less weight for some
reason or if you just really want to you
know if you really prefer
constant tension style training for some
reason that's fine too
but as far as bottom line muscle growth
is concerned whether you use constant
tension training or not
it's not going to noticeably change your
gains all else equal
