hey folks
dr mike isrtel here for renaissance
periodization with mccool
so to speak new beard that everyone
including my wife hates maybe you'll
hate it too
folks the good morning
not waking up and having a good time but
the good morning exercise to do what
primarily to stimulate hypertrophy in
your hamstrings but also
a little bit in your glutes a little bit
in the adductors sartorius and all those
other muscles
that tend to extend the hip and really
good
actually for the spinal erectors and
some of the other muscles in the back
primary target is the hamstrings so
we'll focus on making sure we do the
exercise well
let's get into the common mistakes and
how to fix them
first two mistakes they're sort of a
combo mistake and they're super super
common done very much often together
is bending the knees improperly so
if you go back by the way to our stiff
legged deadlift video
tons of these are almost the identical
recommendations because it's a very very
very similar lift but you might remember
from that video
there are two mistakes to make at the
knees one is to completely lock your
knees out
which does a good job of pre-stretching
the hamstrings and then trying to bend
over
you can do that but it tends to put a
lot of stress and strain on the knees
it can hurt them a little bit it's
probably not a huge risk for injury
but you can't actually produce a ton of
force with your hamstrings like that
so you end up sacrificing the ability to
put tension through the muscle
to really really pre-stretch it probably
a bit too much
so what you want to do instead is keep
your knees just a little bit
out of the locked position relatively
straight but notice they're not locked
they're right here as you move your hips
back
you keep your knees in the exact same
spot and that pre-stretches and puts
tons of tension on the hamstrings
but still lets them produce a lot of
force as opposed to if they were locked
backwards
the huge temptation if you're not
locking your knees is to go the other
way
as you go down deeper it becomes
apparent to your body that you can
actually move more weight
and hurt your hamstrings less or rather
feel the stretch less
if you bend your knees on the way down
so it's super tempting even if you
manage
to have pretty good technique to let
your knee start bending
what that does is takes tension off of
the hamstrings and now
it's sort of like a partial deadlift
exercise with the bar on your back
really sort of pointless so we want to
do make sure our knees are good by
keeping them
just out of the locked position and then
let the hips
do the rest of the bending we bend at
the hips and nowhere else
next mistake is letting the pelvis
posteriorly tilt thus rounding the lower
back
one bad thing the second bad thing is
you actually take tension away from the
ham so check this out
the whole purpose of this movement is to
load the hamstrings the hamstrings cross
the knee joint and the hip joint
so what you want to do is keep your legs
straight
not locked but straight so at the knees
and
you want to pre-stretch the hamstrings
by anteriorly tilting your pelvis
basically pushing your butt back
right a lot of bad stuff about anterior
pelvic tilt
mostly made up by people who don't know
what they're talking about some of it's
valid in extreme circumstances
but in the good morning you want to
anteriorly tilt your pelvis
because that pre-stretches the
hamstrings and now
when you bend it's a hamstring dominant
movement
if you allow as you bend for your pelvis
to posteriorly tilt
you end up rounding over even if your
lower back doesn't round
but just your pelvis comes down what
ends up happening is that the hamstrings
are no longer
having a ton of tension throughput
through them and they're not the prime
mover and thus they're not the target
now it's a something that maybe the
glutes are more involved in and yes you
can lift more weight
but you'll notice and this is how to
tell if you're doing it if you're
properly anterior tilting your pelvis
what's going to happen is you're going
to feel a ton of tension
painful tension through the hamstrings
the back of your leg
as you get deeper and deeper as soon as
the pelvis starts to get into posterior
tilt
you're not going to be able to feel that
tension anymore so the good thing is is
you have a cheat sheet
inside your own body how your hamstrings
feel to know if you're doing this right
so the big emphasis here is as soon as
you're locking back
keep that pelvis tilted that doesn't
mean you have to round or arch your back
your spine
can be neutral it can be arched whatever
way feels more comfortable for you that
pelvis
has to be anteriorly tilted so as you go
down and down and down
you want tension on your hamstrings
the next pair of mistakes is about range
of motion
two ways to screw this up one is an
insufficient range of motion
and this is when folks do everything
right and then they get to where they
don't really feel their hamstrings
stretch and painfully uh a lot yet
and they'll just kind of come up right
it'll go down
and come up and externally it looks like
they're doing a good job but they're so
much more flexible
they could have a lot more stretch under
tension for their hamstrings if they
went lower
how do you know you're not going deep
enough when you don't have a
perceptively painful not crazy pain
but some painful stretch in your
hamstring that's when you know you're
going deep enough if you're not
going deep enough you can probably tell
if it doesn't feel that bad on your
hamstrings
going deeper means you get to use less
weight but do a good job hypertrophy the
muscle more it's kind of a win-win
if you cut your depth a lot and you do
these halfway good mornings
you're really not doing a good job of
stimulating hamstrings and it's a ton of
load to bear on the spine
causes more fatigue on the other hand if
you want extra credit for depth here's
the deal
you can only go as deep as your lower
back
won't round into so neutral or arched
and
your knees still locked and your pelvis
anteriorly tilted
at some point given a certain load
flexibility and experience
you'll only be able to hit a certain
depth going lower requires you to
sacrifice in one of those three areas
one your upper back is start to round
not the purpose of the movement you can
lose a lot of tension that way in force
production
two is your pelvis starts to tilt uh
posteriorly again taking tension off the
hands and three
you can start to bend your knees wholly
pointless
so there is such a thing as too much
range of motion you want enough range of
motion
to where you really feel it in your
hands with good technique but
only so much that you don't have to
compromise by rounding over
the right range of motion painful
tension is a really really good way to
go
[Music]
the next mistake is not having a
standardized range of motion
if each good morning is a little bit
different depth not a terrible thing
but the problem is it's difficult to
assign a stimulus if you want to do a
little bit more
this time than last time you actually
don't know how much total work was done
force times distance so you might by
cutting your reps a little bit this time
but using more weight
end up doing less work this time not
have as overloading of a session as you
could have
secondarily how are you supposed to
track your performance over time
if you're cutting your depth to
different types even if
you're trying your best sometimes it's
really hard to make sure you're getting
the same depth every time
however this is a solved problem which
is why for this part of the video
i'm in the rack set up your rack height
and it's going to take some time to
figure out which one is best
at the very point in your range of
motion where with your working weight
because sometimes
less weight on the bar doesn't put you
into that extreme of a flexible position
so you'll have to experiment with this
but at some point you'll find a bar
height
which we have right there which for me
is the right height to get me into that
exact
perfect range of motion that gives me a
ton of tension and stretch on my
hamstrings
while the rest of my body doesn't have
to get out of position so now
instead of doing this which is the
mistake okay this is a good rep
and then this one i get deeper and that
kind of felt like so i do this how
many reps is that who knows
now we have the supports i can make sure
to lock into my technique
and every time gently touch and come up
and every time gently touch and come up
and now i know exactly how many reps
they did because they were all the same
and here's a really cool part i can
focus more on
feeling my hamstrings and making sure
all of the rest of my body is in
position
and the bars let me know when i've
gotten low enough
because a lot of times there's a lot of
 to think about you think okay i
gotta keep my pelvis tilted and i gotta
keep my chest up and all of a sudden my
knees what about my knees
and then you're like wait a minute am i
deep enough yet my hamstrings kind of
hurt but do they hurt enough
once you have a standardized range of
motion all you have to do is think about
your technique
feeling the tension on your hands and
you know exactly when to come up when
you feel a gentle touch and that's it
a huge part of the reason we do good
mornings
is to focus on the eccentric phase
because the eccentric phase
the controlled descent lengthening the
muscle while it's being tensed
is hugely hypertrophic you can make this
easier on yourself
by dive bombing into the good morning
and then all of a sudden
you don't have a ton of tension during
the eccentric phase right so instead of
doing this
where you slowly ease in with your
working weight and come up
you're now doing this whoop and then you
go and then loop you drop in and
boom two problems with that one dropping
into your hamstrings like that with a
lot of weight
absolutely increases your injury risk it
doesn't make it super high
but definitely high enough for you to
not want to do it part two
we are here to get the hypertrophy from
the eccentric phase
even though it sucks my personal
recommendation to you just
accept that good mornings suck and
 do them to get bigger hamstrings
don't try to rush them you're thinking
oh man this blows if i went faster it
would be less time under pain
but you came here for the pain take your
time you don't have to do a five second
eccentric
and wait for forever but control on the
eccentric
gentle touch and then coming up is way
better
than boom and then trying to come up as
fast as you can
next mistake is re-bending the knees on
the way up
so a lot of folks have no problem
getting into good position keeping their
knees back on the way down
but then they want some extra help
standing up what sometimes they'll do is
they'll
re-bend their knees they'll essentially
bend them a little bit here
and almost squat the weight up good news
is you can do more reps that way
bad news is the reps don't count for
 because you're missing out on the
concentric work of the hamstrings
you got the eccentric hey you're halfway
there but now it's time to use your
hamstrings
with the knees in the same position to
come
up with the weight if you re-bend you
use less hamstrings
cool you did a wrap but who cares
because the target muscle wasn't the one
most activated
the next mistake isn't so much a mistake
but it's a really cool tip to make sure
your technique actually hits the hams
the most
a lot of folks the good morning is seen
as a bending over and that's not
technically wrong
but it's helpful to think about it
another way for some people to get
everything locked in
and they'll start to bend forward and
like to the external eye
it might look pretty good the problem is
i'm on my toes here
i'm not producing a ton of force and
because i'm bent forward the pelvis
usually starts to tilt and i don't feel
my hamstrings as much as i could
it's much better to focus on this
movement as keeping the chest up while
pushing the hips back
so you essentially want to touch
something really far behind you with
your butt
take that for what it is but when you're
pushing pushing back back back back back
it ends up being as long as you keep
your knees back and your chest up the
movement auto corrects
and it's an absolutely baller feeling on
your hamstrings
versus if i think about it as going
forward i might look
decent enough but i don't produce as
much force my hamstrings aren't as
involved
no bueno next mistake
is overvaluing hand position and head
position we're gonna do a two for one
again here's the deal folks
why the hell am i holding the bar like
this and is this really a standard bar
am i really six nine
no the reason i'm holding the bar like
this is because i am
pretty inflexible because my arms are so
goddamn big nowadays
a little rich piana there for you i
actually can't grab the bar
normally and have it sit comfortably on
my neck okay
so what is so wrong with me putting my
hands here well nothing
if the bar is stable and i'm able to
execute the reps no problem
with the bar being stable on my back
whichever grip you use
that is comfortable for your elbows your
wrists
your shoulders and your neck is totally
fine as long as it's a high bar position
right underneath your neck your traps
are scooted back any grip you want to
use is fine and i can only demo this one
because i
i guess i finally got jacked enough to
essentially be immobile
all right second point what about the
head a lot of folks will say head
position
you got to look down because something
something extends or activation or you
got to look up something something
extensor activation believe it or not
people use both of those to justify
supposedly good technique
here's what you do with your head
whatever the hell you like as long as it
helps you maintain
really good technique nice tight back
butt back knees straight and a ton of
force
if you're strongest here and you're
looking down and everything is good
about your movement
that's awesome do that if like me
you're strongest somewhere in the
intermediate that's totally fine too so
you can look
sort of a little bit down and forward
some folks many folks
like to look up with their good mornings
especially as the weight gets heavier
because that's a cue for them not to
round their back whatever you likes
works
here's the thing none of this will get
you hurt because there's no force
transduction through your cervical spine
if you think that you're going to get
hurt looking up
don't ever go to new york city and look
up at skyscrapers because there's the
same amount of force through your neck
there
you could just get hurt looking up
next problem we could run into is not
feeling the tension
through the hams like we want here's the
deal
there are no golden rules here except
for the basics
of making sure your knees are nice and
straight your hips are bending
and your back is at least neutral
everything else is really down
to what you feel the most so some folks
will take a close stance and it'll work
super super well for them
they'll actually feel their hands some
people with a close stance can't get the
flexibility here
and they don't really feel much of
anything some people are better with a
medium stance
some folks with a wide stance sumo good
mornings are absolutely a thing
to you they might feel crappy that might
mean to somebody else they feel good so
feel free to experiment
hand positions foot positions also how
far you turn your feet out you can point
your feet straight
you can point them out a little bit and
if you're doing a sumo you can point
them out a lot
whatever lets you feel the hams actually
working producing lots of force
and what's comfortable for your knees
hips and so on and so forth
also depth some folks will get to a
certain depth and feel a great
combination of tension and stretch that
means they have a painful stretch and
they're using lots of weight
that's where they prefer they could use
less weight and go even deeper
but then the pain is still there but the
tension and the load is so light that
they might not get as good of an effect
they might not see as much soreness
might not get as good of a pump
here's the deal use the basic techniques
to funnel your technique into something
that's very good
within that the foot and hand positions
and everything is an experiment for you
to try
to see what feels best for you
the last mistake here is going too heavy
or too light on good mornings
what's too heavy on the good mornings
generally they're very good to do in the
5 to 10 rep range however
with stiff-legged deadlifts going as low
as 5 reps on the first set
seems to be okay and people seem to be
able to conserve their technique
with good mornings for some reason i've
personally found with a lot of folks
i've worked with
that anything less than about eight reps
per set on a first set especially
tends to be so heavy that it becomes
difficult to focus on the technique
and you end up just rounding your back
just a little nothing unsafe
your knees bend a little more than you
want and it becomes an exercise with
which to lift lots of weight
as opposed to one in which you can
really expose your hamstrings to tension
so what i would recommend
the sets of at least eight reps what
about much higher than that well
anything above 15 reps really just turns
into endurance work for your erector
muscles
which is cool but not the reason we do
this exercise
of 45 degree back raises flexion rows
those are better for that muscle
right so anything north of 15 reps is
probably not great
ideally and hilariously for bodybuilding
purposes the 8 to 12
range is super super well suited for
good mornings
folks thank you so much for tuning in
good luck practicing your good mornings
remember the weight on the bar is not
nearly as important as getting really
really good technique
set yourself up on the bars to make sure
you're getting the same depth every time
really focus on keeping your chest up on
keeping your knees
nice and just tiny little bit of bend
the same bend every time
anteriorly tilt that pelvis do your best
possible job you know you're doing your
job well
when you get nasty delayed onset
soreness in your hamstrings
good luck do your best we'll see you
next time for the next technique video
and if you have any questions
or suggestions for other videos to shoot
and other techniques to try
shoot it in the comments see you guys
later
[Music]
so the next tip is to make sure that our
hips are in line with our
