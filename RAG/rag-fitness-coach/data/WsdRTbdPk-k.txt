hey what's up guys today i wanted to do
a quick video just addressing something
that i've been noticing more and more
lately
and that is this notion that everything
is okay in moderation
so typically you'll hear this as
something to the tune of
well okay you can have some high
glycemic carbs
even if you're on a diet as long as it's
kept in moderation
or yes sure you can treat yourself to
some ice cream once in a while as long
as it's done in moderation
or everything is okay in moderation
and while i'm not sure that this is an
explicit example of an appeal to
moderation
it certainly teeters very closely on its
edge
and if you're not familiar with what an
appeal to moderation is
an appeal to moderation otherwise known
as the false compromise
is a logical fallacy that states that
the answer to a problem is always
between
two extremes and i'll just borrow the
first example from wikipedia to
illustrate my point some would say that
hydrogen cyanide is a delicious and
necessary part of the human diet
but others claim it is a toxic and
dangerous substance now if you don't
know
hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic it
would be a very bad idea to consume it
at all so clearly some things
are just bad even if they're consumed in
moderation
and likewise some things are just okay
whether we consume them in moderation or
not
so in this case i think that saying on
the one hand we have
food x which is okay and then on the
other hand we have
food y which is okay but only if used in
moderation
is still setting up a good food bad food
dichotomy
and it's sort of missing the point i
would rather say
focus on reaching your calorie and
macronutrient goals for the day
fit three to four servings of vegetables
in your diet per day
get two to three servings of fruit per
day
get a serving or two of dairy hit your
fiber goal
and then fill in the rest with foods
that you enjoy
and in this way we'd be setting up the
diet in an inclusive manner
rather than an exclusive manner by
saying that
such and such a food is not good
but if you're going to treat yourself
make sure you do it in moderation now
this may seem in conflict with what i
said in a previous video where i
recommended that
about 20 percent of the diet should come
from or can come from
junk food sources and i just want to
make it clear that
i made this recommendation completely
arbitrarily
just based off of my own personal
experience
and some of the psychological cues that
i experienced
when eating an excess of highly
palatable
foods and an obvious problem that arises
in making such a recommendation
is well what qualifies as junk food
and as far as i know there's no clear
answer to this question
and i also want to make it clear what
i'm not saying in this video
what i'm not saying is that we can never
speak of using things in moderation
in fact i think many things really are
best used in moderation like alcohol for
example
my main point really is that i would
rather see us making dietary
prescription based on
inclusive claims rather than exclusive
claims
and i think that this very common appeal
to moderation
can still in some more subtle ways set
up
good food bad food dichotomies and like
i said
the difference here is subtle but i did
think it was profound enough to make
a video dedicated to it so if you guys
