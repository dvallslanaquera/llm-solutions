hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization let me ask you
a question do you like the finer things
in life
cars expensive clothes that tell other
people
gee you know you really are an important
person that has money
exotic animals that you can have as pets
they're dangerous but don't worry you're
rich enough to hire people to take care
of that part for you
drinks cristal champagne
pasta
spaghetti steak and shrimp that's
literally a line from a fabulous rap
song back in the day which dates me
incredibly why am i telling you about
all these things because if you simply
drop your moral compass and chill for
big diet soda like i'm about to you can
have all these things guys they
literally send me millions of dollars
in paychecks per week so that i make
videos like this video's like what dr
mike ha i'm glad you asked let's begin
the actual video so
this is titled switching to diet soda
and
i'm saying that it's one of the few real
fat loss hacks
i can't believe i'm saying that there
are real diet hacks turns out yes so the
vast majority
of hacks you see on various podcasts and
cd youtube areas and
advertised to you for supplement company
stuff like that they're not actually
hacks a hack is a very specific thing
a hack is technically defined as a way
to modify the behavior of a system
in a way that it was not intended when
built to elicit a more desirable outcome
for that hacker
so you can be a hacker yourself if you
switch diet soda i promise that's
actually a real thing
so
what's the system here well your body
has a system that
drives it to consume tasty sugary things
like soda
because the system is designed to infer
that tasty sugary things bring in
calories
and in our ancestral evolutionary
environment from which we are all
descended
that was a very reliable thing
now the reality is that artificial
sweeteners
are really a hack
because they give you that very similar
almost the same sweet sensation
especially if something like diet soda
tastes almost exact like regular soda
but it gives you that without any of the
calories
right so it actually is a hack in the
technical sense a lot of other you know
diet hacks are just strategies like hack
your metabolism with one meal a day like
anybody then wasn't supposed to eat five
meals and the one meal hacks it is just
another way of eating this really is a
hack and what does it get us well
in study after study people only
switching from regular soda to diet soda
lose mounds of weight you guys know that
candy bar mounds who the fuck ever buys
this shit's nasty i know some of you
will get in the comments and say i'm
wrong and maybe i am but in any case
diet soda
just the switch is one of the easiest
things in the world because your body
sort of still feels like it's getting
the sugar and the diet soda tastes great
but if you just take like three regular
cans or bottles of coca-cola classic and
replace them with coke zero let's say
you just have three cans of coke or
bottles of coke throughout the day
that is in excess
of 500 calories that if replaced by coke
zero is simply gone from your diet and
if you change nothing else which you
often won't
you can lose a pound per week for many
many weeks ahead and i'm sure you have
stories of your own or friends or family
and relatives
that have lost a ton of weight either
starting with or only switching out diet
drinks or sorry regular drinks
and putting in diet drinks it's a thing
that works really really well
now there's something to say about so
and yes i am advocating for this i think
it's a very good idea for almost
everyone the transition can be a little
bit rough
first of all
no diet soda has basically no downsides
to regular soda in this context it's
much better for your health yes the
carbonation etc still not great for your
teeth
yes some people don't respond tiny
fraction of people get weird and they
get headaches on some artificial
sweeteners and that's totally
understandable there are exceptions but
for almost everyone
it's something that tastes almost
exactly the same but carries like zero
of the effect on your body weight okay
diet soda does not boost your insulin
levels or anything like that it doesn't
make you rebound hungry for more sugar
those are all so it doesn't boost anyone
any human's insulin and some people get
rebound hunger but they get the same
thing from regular coke too so it's all
much better if you have diet versus
regular coke because if you get
regular uh you drink a diet coke and
it's like oh man now that i have that
sweet taste i want some food for most
people it doesn't work like that but for
the ones that it does you can at least
have something healthier as far as food
that you crave you can have so some
veggies or some fruit or something
as opposed to just having actual sugar
in your soda itself that you drink so
you can make it better much much better
of a result even if you still feel like
you need to eat a little bit extra okay
much better for your health
for some people
they already drink a combination of
regular soda and diet soda and they're
absolutely not interested
um in switching oh sorry
for some people when they have a
combination of regular soda and diet
soda
they can tell the difference in tastes
but they're okay with it because they
have regular sometimes they have time
some people have regular soda and they
have no interest in switching at all
here's how you do that first of all you
do it cold turkey you just take all of
your regular sodas you finish them or
pour them down the drain or whatever
feed them to the birds not entirely sure
how birds would
consume soda might kill them just
kidding good experiment to find out
what you do is cold turkey you just get
rid of all your regular sodas or stop
buying them start buying diet sodas for
a few weeks the taste will be off for
some people it will the first couple of
days especially you're like this is
bullshit this doesn't take like regular
it doesn't taste like regular coke i
don't give a shit what anyone says it's
wrong but here's the thing you get used
to it
and after a few weeks at most
starts to taste pretty good again and it
starts to taste pretty normal
and you can sometimes barely remember
what regular tasted like if you go back
to regular which you shouldn't because
it's a pointless fucking drink for
almost everyone who wants to control
their body weight
then you'll be like oh wow it does
really taste different sometimes
sometimes you're like oh this actually
the regular stuff tastes like super like
thick and weird it's like if you get
used to drinking skim milk going back to
whole milk you're like am i there globs
of snot in this holy shit is this milk
way like as much as uranium like that's
too much for me
that being said
there are exceptions to that rule
coke zero i have to say and i think uh
pepsi has a equivalent product
are unbelievable sucrose sucralose is
just a god-like artificial sweetener
coke zero really does sometimes taste
like the real thing we're damn close and
this is from people who really liked
real coke hate diet coke they tried coke
zero and they're like oh wow okay this
is legit this is a big difference so
not only is there this weird
transitional period for two weeks
potentially in which after which
you
everything tastes pretty good as far as
diet stuff but sometimes
if you switch something like cozero
that transitional period might be like
one meal of you drinking a coke and be
like oh that's a little different that's
pretty good next me like yeah it's a
coke whatever right
and
after that transition period
it's not like you're like oh man
years ago i used to drink regular sprite
now i drink diets bright i just hate it
i just miss my regular sprite so much
almost no one has that sensation
and almost everyone that says i love
regular coke i don't like diet there's
not that they had a time when they had
diet coke and then they went back they
just
have regular and at a party they had
diet once by accident they hated it if
you commit yourself for a few weeks it's
all down the drain after that you're
you're not going to remember in vivid
detail how that should taste and at the
very least you're not going to crave it
anymore and if you crave it anymore
which is incredibly unlikely
gee whiz you know diet's so close it's
not really that big of a deal
here's the thing
give it some thought give it a shot just
take out all of your regular soda
replace it with diet and it's going to
make you healthier
and leaner and all that good stuff it's
also better for your teeth because it's
sans sugar
and if you're around friends and family
that drink regular soda if they ask you
about it you know you don't want to be
that dick that's like hey man everyone's
not fit only me
if they ask you about it feel free to be
like hey you're like yeah i drink diet i
think there's no good reason outside of
very small exceptions to drink regular
soda in the modern capitalist world
because we don't need soda to prop up
our calorie levels we need the opposite
fewer calories and diet soda is
unbelievably safe
has zero calories and tastes
after two weeks especially
damn near like the real thing
give it some thought and if you have
unbelievably unique snowflake opinions
and why everything i said is wrong
please post them in the comments
otherwise like subscribe and uh if you
are walking around uh you know in a in a
downtown where there's like a coca-cola
headquarters or sub-headquarters or
something and a man in a suit walks out
and you know he works for coke and he
looks at you with his hat make sure to
tip him and say hey keep up the uh money
for dr mike he does need more expensive
cars clothes jewelry and whatever it is
people buy with money see you guys next
time
