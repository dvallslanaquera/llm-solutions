one more one more one more lift okay
come on come on go all the way hold hold
hold hold hold hold hold down slow
[Music]
[Music]
yo YouTube what up
got a few people to introduce you to
me I'm Dr Mike hello hello
hey hold on
Jared feather ifbb Pro master's degree
in exercise and sports science Elite
coach of the elite Pros that's all true
and the most true part my literal
biological son
look at him my boy seed and
he had a daughter recently oh my God
this is Jenna Geary she is not new to
the channel you guys know her tell her
what up in the comments
she trains at one speed
hard I don't know how hard is the speed
hard as your body you know what I'm
saying girl what else 100
shut up Doctor Mike let's get to the
video
[Applause]
first exercise is the face pull can be
done in a variety of ways with a variety
of grips we have some interesting dildo
handles today they're new here Dragon's
Lair and we kind of think like hey why
not let's try
uh
the purpose of the face pull is to train
any part of adults which lines up best
with the direction of pull
in the case of the face bullet really
just depends on where you put
the attachment itself and how it slides
so if you put it lower and you pull more
up it's more side belt if you put it
higher and you pull down it's more
reared out but if you put it too high
you get a lot of back work as well so we
like to say right at about face level is
a good place to start and work from
there remember to get a big stretch at
the bottom and a nice Peak contraction
at the top to hold for a second and
squeeze and connect with those rear
belts if you can and then we go from
there sets of oh yeah you know 15 to 25
reps really is the kicker here one of
the reasons is because these Reps don't
take a long time each it's not a lot of
distance to move and it ends up being
that we can generate more tension over
more time get a bigger burn if we can
actually do a few more reps watch this
technique Jen is fucking ace when it
comes to this shit I'm sure my head will
pop up later and tell you more tips yes
this time no bullshit let's go one slow
oh shit yeah okay don't swing you're
adult
two slow
dogs
yes oh that's amazing go ahead and wrap
oh
look at that pump in her delts already
Jesus fucking crazy it sounds like
really stupid holy shit that's obnoxious
oh my god oh they're already it's like
an instant change
a couple more Reps for sure
Delta
two more
no swinging
one
last one coming up elbows back yes slow
[Music]
oh
that was sweet that was so good
the belt's got their own ZIP code at
this point oh
oh I want a drink but I can't I wish I
had a straw
why can't you drink because I can't hold
my cup
are we getting this Jen is so fucking
jacked and lean that you will see the
direction of her fiber contraction
in this exercise making the coaching
easy as shit you'll also see that at the
tail end of the range of motion as the
pull on the belts occurs the rear belts
are very elongated and they are
significantly shortened at the end
does this mean it's all rear delt no the
side belts also go through the same
process so I properly executed exercise
in this case for the Rope face pull
includes rear delts as well as side
belts because side belts are very
resistant to hypertrophy your rear delts
already get a crap load of work for back
training every single back exercise
trains your rear delts Bar None and that
means the rear delts are already kind of
being trained really well kind of like
the front belts are from chest training
we'll take as much extra side belt work
as we can the key here is quality and
watch this one of the cues they're going
to use is to tell Jen to have a slow
eccentric control it's easy to pull it
up to here slowly lowering and feeling
those fibers micro tear oh that is as
people say the bee's knees which I never
actually understood what that means do
bees even fucking have neither sure shit
don't have kneecaps another little
shit's been but they're too creepy to
look at under microscopes oh they got
all that hair and they bite fuck that
fuck you inside good one more good
technique if it stops to stop whatever
very good one more set left dinosaur
hands
shit you got this
oh these are so good
[Music]
excellent
oh yeah
go
good
three more and you're done good
technique though elbows back
one all right hold it back there for a
second
two last one
yes
oh God fuck my hands
don't fuck my hands
fuck something else sorry that was
inappropriate
fucking all right
[Music]
I'm just kidding sort of all right so
here's the deal
A variation
on the theme of side out training with
lateral stumble laterals it is totally
great to do dumbbell laterals
to just below parallel amazing it is
totally great to do them to just above
parallel amazing
it is totally cool to do them and stop
at whatever point you want for a Split
Second
another way to do them is this we
realize that between here and here
Gravity doesn't affect us much because
the joint angle is all wrong gravity
only points down
from here to here not a whole lot
happens either so we're going to try
today is Jenna's going to start at a
roughly 45 degree angle go up to above
45 come back down under control up and
pause down under control every time it's
45 degrees 45 degrees this means
constant tension on the muscle which
isn't some magical thing it just means
lack of gas would accumulate and
interesting things will happen as soon
as you're done with a set like that
you switch to the dumbbells pointed this
way and you pull up with your elbows to
do dumbbell upright rows these will also
be with a pause sound good
yes don't worry about how high the reps
are just every rep quality oh these are
so good
good
up
good get your get your thumbs in there
get your thumbs under
do a couple more
[Music]
good two more wait oh my God again
that's it okay upright rows close high
and pause slow
one more let's go
oh you got a couple yeah you got this
dude uh two more
right away right away from the bottom
right back up convince me with that
pause pause
oh God why do I feel like I suck you're
great this is before you came here to
hurt mission accomplished
can you tell the camera why we're doing
the five yeah because I suck that's
right
we're going down to fives because she is
doing an intensive technique she's
obviously very pumped up already from
the exercise before this and this whole
like he said earlier it's like constant
tension on a muscle true concentration
on a muscle you're just constantly
sequestering more and more and more
metabolites the entire set so no she
does not suck she just has very fucking
big dealts which means you actually can
sequester even more metabolites so we're
going down so she can get more reps kind
of meet the needs of the intensity
technique that we're doing you don't
stop I do stop
I should be doing them no you people
suck that are doing 25s 50s 60s fucking
loud races like this with 80s get out of
here with that shit
two more two more two more seven density
come on hell yeah yes slow
you're fucking bounce Jen beautiful and
then upright rows
pauses there it is yes
bring it to your face
[Music]
keep going
go go go go go go two more two more on
your knife don't swing no leaning
forward hold down one more right back up
go go hell yeah go hold down
oh it hurts so bad right now
that's what I thought
no
maybe I'll get some action
you're like uh oops my bad actually like
if I wanted to respond it became violent
and I wanted to restrain you go like
this I'd just be like all right stay
calm go ahead no no no no try
[Laughter]
Jan's delts are enormous
and with proper technique and a high
level of relative effort how much you
give to each set she's using the fives
your boy you know tldr I do from the
side I do have quite large delts
just not from the front and I have
overhead pressed 275 for eight standing
that is on YouTube
and I only need like the 20s or the 25s
for this exercise I can even get a ton
out of the 15s you're just trying to
make me feel better no it's legitimately
true I've never tried to make you feel
good in my life oh yeah true good point
good point
so honestly you need to use Progressive
overload more reps more weight over time
but that place where you start over
place where you start with really good
technique could be so low you look
around the gym you're like am I the only
here person here doing the fives
remember at your gym if Jen showed up
and fucking got adult pump she would
shut everything down all the guys would
be looking all the girls would be
looking be like holy fuck shit this is
an ifb Pro this is good as it gets she's
using the fives don't you fucking worry
about what you're using think about your
Technique Jared what do you use for this
exercise
15 to 20 Jared Felts have their own
delts and those dealts they're working
on balancing their own think about that
shit let's do an upset
Wonder Woman effort let's go never heard
of her let's go
go go go go go go yes beautiful two more
put them up there keep them up hold it
right back up go
hold it down again again I know you do
hold it down keep going keep going
come on now go another one high elbows
speed
hold
down slow
drop
God damn dude I don't train
I've been telling you that for years
Mike
we could use a little bit more front
delt work just to cap the whole thing
off and when your rear and side delts
are really really toasted if you're
doing standing barbell overhead process
properly
they will also begin to be limiting
factor especially the side delts so this
actually is a very good side belt
exercise if your side belts are pretty
exhausting
you're going to notice that Jenna's
doing the quintessential thing for good
overhead press this is not a good
overhead press That's just more upper
chest and just front Bell a good
overhead press pushes over the face and
as soon as you pass the face real close
to the face you're gonna push the bar
backwards
and you're going to push your face
forward and you're going to reverse that
movement on the way back down that
backward pushing you'll notice the angle
is that it actually hits your side belt
it's a really awesome movement I
wouldn't do it first in an exercise
training session because you're going to
be fresh and with the trillion pounds
and your front delts and triceps are
good anyway from chest and tricep
training
but at the end of a session for
shoulders if you hit the rears if you
hit the sides and Jen's done two
exercises already for the sides and one
for the rear
this begins to be a really good overall
shoulder exercise technique is King slow
eccentric touch the clavicle every time
keep the bar as close to your face every
time tight core chest slightly up let's
do things
good slow
yes
slow
back
one more take your time with this one
slowing the way down pause at the bottom
oh yeah
Mac come on yes yes slow and then wrap
push it down as if you're gonna do
another
hold
wrap
shit
you're like if uh Wonder Woman action
figure was built properly for the first
time ever
it's fucking awesome I'll take that shit
I'll take it now I'll take that and put
it in my mind there you go I give the
good with the bad the bad news is start
your fucking set okay
good
both arms extend together
that's it that's the set
yeah your delts are really fucked huh
fuck yes they are
ah
did we get the thumbnail already
okay
do my legs look good does my waist look
small Scott are you doing your job oh
they won't okay
do your job
shrink an inch and a half okay no it
hasn't I have a very big dick according
to the according to the internet of a
huge one we're gonna lose it if you keep
talking like that all right
folks
[Laughter]
Jen
your training intensity is in another
level altogether
how do you do it tell your fans what the
secret is to getting a Jenna Geary level
of intensity
for me I
I push as hard as I push because I
physically can't quit so like if I have
anything in me I'm gonna give everything
I got to push the Reps why not just quit
it's easy
because I want to see what my body's
capable of and if I just keep pushing my
limits then I'm gonna capitalize on
every rep on everything and then I
really truly see what I can do
I can't do a better outro than that see
you guys next time
