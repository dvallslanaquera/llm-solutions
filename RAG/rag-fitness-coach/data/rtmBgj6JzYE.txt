best analogy I have to come up with of
people who pretend have a mind muscle
connection when they're too weak and too
out of touch with their bodies or have
never trained hard enough to really
understand what that means I bring all
the old laptop and I am a hacker watch
this ready reaching a file protocol all
right we're in we're in fellas wait I
was just doing this on the keys randomly
oh it looks Advanced but I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing just like almost
all hackers and movies don't know what
they're doing and they're doing random
shit and people of the gym that think
they're hitting Lots with this one weird
bullshit but they've only been training
for three years and they actually don't
know how to train hard enough to hit any
muscle
