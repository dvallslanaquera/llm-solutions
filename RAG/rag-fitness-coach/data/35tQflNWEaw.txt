hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization welcome welcome welcome if
you're a returning customer welcome back
if you're a new viewer i apologize in
advance for my current language
increasing your squat we have some
simple tips there are more advanced tips
that will come out in a later video but
just to keep it simple increasing your
squat can be a matter of
apparently i wrote down seven things so
here we go
first and this is a big one and a lot of
these will apply to beginners and
intermediates if you're advanced when
you're watching this i think in a week
or so we should probably have a video
right up your alley
one
is standardize your technique
you want to find a strong comfortable
technique a solid walkout where you know
exactly how many steps you're taking
and you want to replicate it on all of
your warm-up lifts and on your on your
actual working sets
the reason i say this is a lot of folks
have told me in the past okay my squat
is having some trouble i watch them
squat and kind of every rep looks a
little different and
not a little different like
enough different to where i'm like oh
you made this mistake on this rep and
that mistake on that rep every set looks
different
if you can't get a standardized good
technique you can't even intellectually
approach the problem what's wrong with
your squat because what's wrong with
your squat is this like stochastic
matrix that changes all the time
if you standardize a technique you will
allow your nervous system to start to
replicate the same technique and your
nervous system is incredibly powerful at
learning and when it learns better how
to do a movement it becomes vastly more
efficient at that moment you're
practicing how you play all of a sudden
practice makes perfect right and you
start playing better so standardizing
your technique
to anything that's remotely good
sticking with that for a few weeks
because like some people walk a squat
out sometimes they'll be narrow stance
sometimes mid stance sometimes wide and
like what the hell is going on here
standardize that technique practice that
standard your squat will improve if
that's your issue
number two
a lot of people will do
lots of maximum work sets of ones sets
of two a lot of max effort stuff
oh my computer just says lenovo says
congrats on your new device
get started motherfucker i am starting
i'm literally giving i'm at work
fuck when i was sending this uh this new
computer up uh by the way my computer
costs 400 how bothers that unbelievable
time we live in um when i was setting up
my computer yesterday it like literally
clicked like what do you use it for it's
like gaming porn whatever and i clicked
the business one and now it's like
literally kicking dicks out of my mouth
at work unbelievable a lot of people do
max effort stuff singles and stuff and
that's cool to show off and it really
teaches you how to do singles really
well but after a while it's not
sufficiently voluminous it's not enough
practice at the movement for your
muscles to grow very much or for your
nervous system to get very good on the
other hand some folks do higher
repetitions that's a five to ten great
for building muscle and sets of 10 to 15
sometimes even better for building
muscle
they don't convert as well to what we in
sport science call basic strength just
fundamental fucking core brutal strength
the way you get that is sets of three to
six so if you want your one rep max of
squats to go up in within the next few
weeks do plenty of singles and stuff
like that that always works great but if
you want your squat to really go up a
lot
or a little bit of an investment in the
next several months sets of three to six
or where it's at focus on those
next number three squat more often a lot
of folks wonder why their squat won't
come up but they train squats one day a
week the thing is this comedy from any
other sport perspective pick any sport
just think of a sport in your mind right
now it's volleyball isn't it fucking
perverts
men's volleyball that's what i was
thinking of in any case how many
volleyball players practice volleyball
once a week
what like that's not even recreational
volleyball that's something you do on
occasion and these are complex movement
patterns and you know they take a lot of
practice squatting isn't exactly a
complex movement pattern but it's
sufficiently complex that practicing it
more than once a week yields marginal
return on your investment i say marginal
because it's not going to revolutionize
your squat you're going to go from
squatting 300 pounds for max to spawning
600 pounds from a max just from adding
another one one session a week of
frequency but it will make a notable
difference in most cases
should it be two hard squat workouts a
week maybe but if you're doing one i
would say go to two
if you're doing two i'd say go to three
three plus like four five six there's a
big fatigue trade-off it's not super
clear what's happening there but
certainly don't just go out once a week
if you want your best squat if you're
squatting twice a week and it's really
beating you up already and you don't
think you can add another session what
you can do is take the volume of each
workout reduce it
take it from monday and thursday
move that one session to wednesday
monday wednesday but with a lower volume
so you can recover between the days and
then friday you think of it's too much
for me to be squatting heavy no worries
put 50 of the normal weight you do
do just a few sets of triples with that
lightweight for technique and that extra
neural learning will mean your squat
goes up and up and up over the weeks
while your fatigue is managed give that
a shot
number four doing the right accessories
a lot of guys will squat super hard
good stuff then their accessories is
like i do leg extensions for three sets
of 10 with a cigarette mouth because i'm
barely even trying
the gym the gym manager is like sir you
can't actually smoke in here like oh
it's will smith i don't light it for the
look i just bite it
how many of you see scott the video guys
old shit so he caught that reference
he's giggling like a little fangirl over
there
who doesn't love will smith raise your
hand
he'll slap you careful
in any case
the real accessories that work best are
not layered extensions they're a great
choice they're an option but consider
this
ultra deep hack squats with a pause
ultra deep leg presses with a pause
front squats sometimes high bar squats
with your knees shooting real far
forward heels on the ground narrow
stance
brutal that's the kind of accessory work
that can really make a big impact give
that a shot in the context of
maintaining your weekly volume so that
you don't overdo it that might help a
ton
all right number five
sometimes it's your quads that limit
your squat and i would say even often
but sometimes your knee extension
ability your quads are strong enough but
you end up cantilevering over on your
way up and your back or your glutes or
your hamstrings is insufficiently strong
and you can't maintain that tight dare i
say
erect posture it's actually what it's
called
how sports science
always making us say the darndest
things that's a problem because if you
fold over in your squat it doesn't
really fucking matter how strong your
quads are because they don't judge the
squat like they judge a good morning
however
if you do some good mornings if you do
some stiff-legged deadlifts if you do
some even deadlifts your posterior chain
can become so strong it is no longer the
limiting factor and then you posterior
chain once strong enough essentially
turns all of your squats into a leg
press because the only factor is your
quads and if you already have strong
quads and you increase the strength of
your posterior chain your squat can
shoot up like fucking wild
give that a shot
if that's your problem that might be a
really awesome solution and will quite
rapidly elevate your squat
another one number six
taking a page out of mr louis simmons's
book as much as it pains me to say that
jk
total respect
if you're squatting a lot and often all
the time and your squat's been going up
but then it's stalled out it might be
that the movement has become a stale
anytime you repeat something way way way
too much your body just like gets tired
of it and it won't increase
that your abilities in that landscape
anymore in that space so what you can do
is strategically remove squatting and
then slowly begin to reintroduce it
again so if your squat's really stale
like if your squat's not going up much
and you've been squatting a lot and
you're looking at the squat rack and
you're like fuck this man i don't want
to be here anymore just kill me and
god's like no problem lightning
and you just absorb the shit you're like
[Music]
you lightening him back and he's like yo
and you're like yo and he's like yo
yo we're like are we related he's like
yeah what's up son
technically
we're all god's children in any case if
that doesn't happen here's what you can
do
take squats out of your program for like
a whole month
even even two four to eight weeks your
whole message cycle no squats at all
hack squats leg press
good mornings stiff legged others leave
all that good stuff in
still training your legs just not with
squats
after a mesocycle of not squatting it's
not going to feel stale anymore you're
going to come back to squats you're
going to be excited to come back to
squats they're going to feel fresh
here's a really cool thing you're going
to have an opportunity to relearn squat
technique a little bit and you might
actually improve it you may find that
you were doing some weird things just as
a matter of habit that you're fresh to
it you don't have to do them anymore
you start with one squat session and
that first mesocycle back and then you
add another squat session and
potentially even two squat sessions
you're squatting three times a week
again like you were back in the day when
it got stale that entire reintroduction
process could see you elevate beyond
your old squat that refresher that
getting away from it is all you need
like sometimes after a long week of
super productive work your brain is
fried like he has like friday at 4 59
p.m you're looking at your spreadsheet
and you're like
and your boss is like hey i'm gonna go
crash my lambo into my wife
see you later right and you're like
oh shit i'm at work still right you're
not getting a whole lot done
did i say crash into my wife your boss
is crazy i'd probably report him to the
police so
if you've got too much work in the week
staying extra late that friday night and
just pouring coffee into your cup and
then the coffee's flowing over your hand
and on the printer no good go home
[Music]
weekend tons of sleep no work relax rest
recover take a trip somewhere come back
monday fresh
and a little rusty tuesday you're back
in the grind wednesday thursday you're
innovating friday you've uh you know
made your own drop shipping company
saturday you're your boss's boss
entrepreneur spelled wrong on instagram
you're the fucking man or
whoever you are
in any case getting away from squats
every now and again a swell idea
last one
this one's kind of a an opening shot
gain weight and gain weight you could be
at a place where you're like four
weighing 150 pounds your squat is
fucking pretty sweet and you could
continue for several months and actually
many years to get a little bit stronger
right but you're 150 pounds and you
squat 350 for a max like that's really
impressive
but you want to squat 405 like it's been
a thing well you know you can squat 405
in like three or four years at 150 which
would be awesome
or you could squat in three or four
months if you just gain up to 165. at
the end of the day
the number one determinant of strength
which is why we have weight classes in
sport is the amount of contractile
tissue you have the amount of muscle
and if you're pretty lean at whatever
body weight you just can't put on much
more muscle because how the fuck does
that work if we put the muscle on the
body but it doesn't weigh anymore
violates at least a few laws of physics
so at some point if you're pretty lean
and pretty jacked and you want to get
much stronger in your squat you should
bigger legs right google charlie jung
it'll auto correct you because you'll
inevitably spell charlie with an e but
charlie's parents are korean so they
spelled his name wrong
and
look at his legs he squatted 800 pounds
raw and you look at his legs and you can
be like what the hell is wrong with his
quads why are they this big well that's
kind of what it takes to squat 800 right
and if you want to squat something more
than you squat now kind of the most
straightforward thing physiologically is
to put on muscle mass and the most
straightforward way to do that is to
gain weight
so
yeah eat up now here's the thing when
you're gaining weight
do a lot of sets of five to ten in the
squat in an accessory work because
that's a really good way for people
interested in strength to gain muscle it
is enough volume but it converts really
well and then after a few months of that
you've gained a ton of weight you've
your sets of five to ten are
skyrocketing and ability don't just go
max out because your body's not ready
for that shit yet it's not
neurologically adapted for singles or
even lower reps
after that do a few months of mostly
sets of three to six reps in the squat
and whatever you want in the assistant
movements can still be five to ten after
a few months of that your squat will
very likely be revolutionized and be way
stronger you'll finally squat 405
you'll finally look over
after you rack the weight and that one
guy i said it guy in the gym that you
always just looked at and you were like
one day he's looking at you and he's
like i never thought anyone could squat
that much weight at your delicious tasty
body weight
dot dot dot hit the showers fellas see
you guys next time
you
