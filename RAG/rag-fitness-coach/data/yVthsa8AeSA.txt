slow that's it that's it that's it if
you're not convulsing it's not
[Music]
working hey folks back Mike here for
Renaissance cretization that's Mr Jared
feather ifb Pro you all know him as
Jared feather ifb Pro and this is Mr
Thomas G and uh we're here in his uh
thousand oats California training studio
and we're going to train his arms all up
and down do you know what else often
happens in Thousand Oaks and Van eyes
and
Burbank that's right adult films are
film here a ton you guys stay tuned we
might get into that sort of thing in a
little bit Meanwhile my third arm
perfect so we're doing a fre arm super
set let's get into
it how was that was it I think uh 10 to
15 range is probably Sol
okay all right so first working set then
Thomas we want you to make sure you go
extra slow on the way down the whole
time there's going to be a time about
Midway here where it's going to want you
to go fast cuz it gets super tough slow
okay touch gently on your throat all the
way to faka we're going to take the set
nice and close to failure okay
perfect beautiful that was a great rep
the athletic elbows
in way to control it there you go good
vincing throat touch every
time there you go one more elbows in
break that slow control control control
control control nice weight here and
then big move oh yeah oh oh
yeah very awesome so why does the
stretch trigger so much growth is it
magical elves and fairies
only yes something something Ronda
Patrick
so that's
it that's science he said autophagy it
turns out that that's not entirely clear
there are a few candidate mechanisms out
there there are components of muscle
that actually do the Contracting there
are components like Titan and nebulin
for example that do the stretching and
there are molecular machines on them
that detect stretching and so there's an
idea that first of all stretching is
requires a lot of muscle activity to get
you out of that really nasty position
but also something about the stretch
itself self might uh essentially message
the rest of the muscle cell like hey
like we're getting really fucked up here
we're asked to produce a lot of tension
at very extreme ranges of motion which
is like evolutionary sense your body
thinking it's in trouble you know uh and
so uh in that situation I think it might
trigger some muscle growth that's a
little extra
yeah
up more you got this all day slow
control control control control control
deep
stretch up yep one more left hold the
hips first hold the hips
[Music]
first slow control deep
stretch Big Move finish cck nice good
stuff see a little tricep action yeah
for sure very good for sure pump a
little bit it's getting there good very
good very good we'll get you really
pumped so one Quee you guys will notice
you're giving Thomas often is to break
it the elbows towards the hips first and
then come down there's the other way of
doing it of just going down like normal
skull pressure both are totally fine to
do the only thing is as Jared and I have
noticed that if you break towards the
hips first you actually minimize chronic
elbow pain for some God damn reason or
another it just takes better care of
your elbows whereas like a lot of the
reach behind the head scull Crushers
I've like wouldn't wasn't able to do for
very long because of elbow pain you
notice that Jared oh yeah yeah so it's
some he also just get better stretch
going down toward the throat you get way
more of a stress in tricep you're
stopping yourself
artificially
up more
more all fucking Daye here you're in
charge super slow all the way down wait
for it
upu one more last one coming up one
more elbows in come on I know it's hard
low on the
throat up press press press
yes all
right good Stu that was really
good little blood in the triceps now
feels good oh it's the
triceps hold on I thought this inverse
bicep exercise no that's awesome man
very cool very cool we're going to break
this down and then we're going to do
warm up for overhead
[Music]

basically depress and break at the elow
forward even more even more even like

sets of triceps we got three Skull
Crushers three OV extensions and three
sets three and a half sets of close grip
push-ups routine some of that so it's
really good you know nine to 10 sets of
triceps is really going to zon them out
in most cases Now we move on to biceps
the first exercise will be a narrow grip
barbell curl Jared is going to queue Us
in you know what an arm Blaster is you
ever seen those
yeah exactly how I want the girl yeah
fighting the elbows in just like with
the tri extensions exact same thing
controlling the entric the entire time
and you know like when people say
superate really hard like have a
dumbbell so if you're pushing your
elbows in and you're bringing it up like
this you're basically suating like if
you had a dumbell on your hand so you're
trying to be here the entire time if
you're here here it's fine you're just
not hitting the biceps is good so Force
those elbows in the entire time up slow
on the way down you want a full full
lock out got it so what a lot of people
will do is they'll go here and they just
rock forward like this and they take
tension off we want tension the entire
