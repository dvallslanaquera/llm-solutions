oh oh you're right it is slime it comes
off the bar this is the part in the
alien movie where it like takes over
randomly
am I supposed to eat this
hey I'm Dr Mike professor of sport
Science and bodybuilder we asked you
guys what the best protein bars in the
world were you let us know we bought
them all and I'm gonna eat all of them
[Music]
anabar the protein-packed candy bar bold
claim how can this bar fail when it has
anabolism right in the name no sugar
alcohols that's kind of good if you
don't want to have bloody diarrhea
YouTube you guys said this bar was sweet
time to find out how wrong you were
fuck that's good
God damn this is for Real motherfuckers
better not be lying about these
ingredients God damn it one of the best
bars I've ever had how to start it's got
the video guys 11 grams of fats a little
high but for 20 grams of protein 25
grams of carbs roughly and no sugar
alcohols uh excellent meal replacement
bar for someone you know even fat loss
phase but definitely uh um if you're
bulking grapes if you're maintaining
great I would say very very very tasty
meal replacement
metrex fruity cereal crunch big 100 bar
the big 100 is a classic
now macros wise it's pretty goddamn good
14 grams of fat not the best
but uh the proteins at 30 which is dope
and the carbs minus fiber situation is
at 42
this is like one of those you want a
protein bar but you're fin me eat yeah
let's find out how it tastes I've
actually never had this flavor before
I've had I think every other flavor so
we picked this one because a YouTube
subscribers uh said that he had this at
a vegan cream well there's a bunch of
cream on here I hope you didn't do it
all over all the bars
fuck
I have an exact exact scenario for how
this bar makes sense you wake up and you
are in
a dystopian future
where everyone is controlled by machines
and lives in little pods and they let
you have Social Hour you meet the cutest
ass bitch she's like you're from the
Before Time and you're like well yeah
I'm saying girl you fuck with that and
she's like gives me this bar and she's
like is this what Fruity Pebbles for
real tasted like in the before times and
I'm like bitch no are you out of your
fucking mind this is exactly what
machines would think that Fruity Pebbles
taste like and they got it wrong these
aren't even smart machines
metrax I love you guys your big 100
chocolate brownie is legitimately one of
my favorite foods period snack no snack
brownie not brownie cheat not cheat it's
just amazing this I'll be charitable and
say for someone else's palette
sure shit not mine fuck that next
the legendary Foods
chocolate cake flavored protein pastry
mm-hmm
yeah
it's good so every protein bar sits on a
spectrum of how good it is and that
Spectrum entirely depends about where
you are in your fitness journey slash
diet Journey if you're off season
end of a massing phase end of a
maintenance phase very beginning of a
cup no protein bar is going to taste
that amazing
the end of a fat loss phase every
protein bar tastes amazing this is one
of the special ones that
beginning of a diet Midway through a
masking phase is still pretty goddamn
good so
um it actually they got the right the
filling it actually tastes like filling
it's got a bit of that creamy texture to
it
the surrounding dough is a bit flakier
than you expect from regular dough which
is of course it's made fucking entirely
protein but uh yes it's actually very
good and my wife and I got a bunch of
these at one point and ate them all so
success
rated uh rated adequate
[Music]
Robert Irvin's fit crunch chocolate chip
cookie dough
chocolate chip cookie dough sport
apparently you guys like this the best
the fit Crunch bars are both insanely
delicious and concomitantly terrible for
you as you would expect chef Robert
Irvin owner says something he's got a
message here on the back my goal is
simple I want to empower people through
food and fitness to thrive each day
let's find out how much thriving is
potentiated after trying this it's
pretty good
um it's not as good as the anavar
it's not
but for the macros definitely not as
good in the anavar but um I'd say this
get you a fit Crunch bar
if you want a protein bar and need
protein but you don't really care about
macros too much it's just an amazing
tasting protein bar or like a decent
tasting candy bar with protein
Mountain Ops 20 grams of protein peanut
butter Bliss
Mountain ah
12 grams of fat you better be stuck up
in the mountains eating this shit need
to burn that shit off when a bear comes
chasing you
or when someone's sufficiently
intelligent tries to open this I will
say Mountain Ops the packaging looks
great look at how orange it is and it's
got the peanut butter Bliss and it's
soft baked used to call me soft Bacon
High School never baked anything
soft a lot
what the fuck is in here taste banana
supposed to have banana raising the bar
never tasted so good
ah fair play Mountain options it's a
fine bar
so those are the ones that you always
see at like REI yeah you're going out in
the wilderness yeah yeah well here's
this bar idiot silent it exists
bear Bells protein bars I've had these
before mostly
Kingdom and it the macros are good very
good slick Packaging
super easy to open three cheers
what is this chocolate dough well
it's got little old thingies on it these
usually just scratch the roof of my
mouth I would describe this bar like a
Dependable boyfriend
is not the best looking guy in the world
not the most athletic his job he does
find it he's not a trillionaire
hey and he always comes through me the
me Oakley that is barbells chocolate
dough it's a bar you can put in your
mouth chew and swallow you won't hate it
and it'll give you protein
welcome best advertising I've ever done
their other flavors are quite good they
have like a nut one like almond or
something or peanut that was really good
this is a salty peanut yeah yeah that's
the salty Peanut's really good I'm not I
don't want to eat anymore Bells
fucking Lenny and Larry
when I look at Lenny and Larry I don't
see two mentally cogent individuals
because by no means clear these people
can operate the requisite Machinery to
design protein bars competently but
maybe they're just two fun loving guys
with connected hair 17 grams of protein
with only two grams of sugar gee whiz
the other macros must be amazing let's
confirm Dolly shit this is not a fitness
food it is a for fun food because it has
17 grams of protein and 21 grams of fat
it has as many grams of fat as I was
years old when I first
received the sexual attention of the
opposite sex what's the flavor here
Maple French toast
crunchy
and almost entirely bereft of flavor
where's the flavor
put more fucking carbs in it God damn it
at 21 grams of fat who's counting at
that point just put everything in it
fuck Lenny Larry your cookies are the
shit this goes to the away place where
we don't talk about things anymore that
go there
oh a classic pure protein now typically
the macros on these are great and indeed
they are and to be honest folks before I
try this whatever I say about how it
tastes doesn't really matter
everyone knows when your hardcore lifter
that you eat pure protein bars for the
macros they are the macros that go into
your face you can eat them in a rush
and they're really easy to pack because
they're small
something has been said about my genital
Anatomy
yes
highly uploaded on YouTube by the way
your motherfuckers are fucking with me
fuck all of you that's got to be a joke
right
right the other ones are better this is
the worst one I've ever had shrimp for
protein if you're protein your chocolate
brownie the original it's fucking
dope
your salted caramel
it's fucking incredible
this somebody need to get fired for that
shit
[Music]
Americans listen up America is in many
ways perhaps some of the most important
the greatest country on the face of the
Earth
but because it does not have a steady
supply of Snickers high protein bars in
other countries like that you know a
kingdom do that leaves us in a
precarious situation where we have to
spend maybe 10 times more defense
spending to just make up for the shame
that we do not have this beautiful
Pinnacle reach
of productive free market capitalism
this is actually fucking decent macros
and you know how it tastes I already
know how it tastes fucking amazing
the best there is no new king the Old
King never left Snickers and protein
are like two dolphins that are in love
having sex you guys ever seen dolphins
have sex when they're in love especially
when they're in love Scott there is a
rainbow bunny rabbit unicorn party
happening in my mouth yes
but not by much anabar is like the guy
that takes second place but he's like
Jack to just missed his conditioning by
a little and you're like bro next year
I'm not writing him off Snickers is
still King unbelievable unbelievable how
is this legal that was the end of our
official testing but we have two fun
bars left our definition of fun may be
radically different
Zone perfect this is the best rated bar
on Amazon the top rated Amazon
you're joking first let's see if it
meets the parameters of the Zone diet
wouldn't it be funny if it didn't
the Snickers beat this straight up on
Macros straight up the Snickers is
better macros
God damn there's better taste fucking
good
that's fucking good that's fucking good
I should have known it's made by Abbott
Labs anything made by a chemical company
Mega Syndicate is at home in my taste
buds
it's fucking great it actually tastes
really good
I wish they could squeeze a little more
protein in there and keep the fat the
same if they could do that they would be
Snookers they are not now that I'm
saying it there's a bit of a bit of a
Tangy aftertaste
Zone how could you
the keto bar it is the worst rated bar
on Amazon whoa it really is keto net
carbs here are three there's three carbs
in this motherfucker
13 grams of fat there's always a trick
to keto calories 170 that's not that
many but also like it's tiny which
memory serves this is 180 calories
watch this
fucking your Clips it's like two times
the size
I had better be getting something for
those 10 extra calories
here we go describe that place for the
audience it It's like got a translucent
texture it's like a layer of slime oh oh
you're right it is slime it comes off
the bar this is the part in the alien
movie where it like takes over randomly
it really is covered in a fluid of sorts
it's at the bar is sweating it's so good
for your Fitness it comes sweating
already am I supposed to eat this oh
shit it's got bovine collagen in it why
didn't you say so peanut butter
chocolate chip
I thought it was going to be squishy but
it looks like sandpaper oh my God
there's oil cover it's oil this is
fucking oil on the bar
keto when will you go away how do you
make something slimy and dry no wait
wait I gotta make your keto keep the
wetness inside the bar folks not outside
of it
get that out of my face
all right folks wrapping it up here the
final verdict is as follows Snickers
high protein range Supreme with an iron
fist unbelievable macros and
unbelievable taste texture the whole
thing it's like they have experience
making candy bars and just add protein
to it
the anabar uh surprise from where the
fuck this came from I believe the
countries are up there's stuff falling
out of it hold up
she's as good as fuck made where
baby
I can just see a bald eagle snatching up
some other country's animal out of the
sky
Snickers dominant anabar honorable
mention as very close runner-up of
course runner up to last is the pure
protein Moulin Rouge Bar whatever the
fuck this is red velvet
[Music]
um it's terrible in every conceivable
way but but that's not the worst bar
because the Wonder fit keto bar is
terrible in ways I couldn't conceive of
and still can't a bar with fucking oil
on it that's also dry on the inside
thank you so much for tuning in
and if we missed a bar or something or
missed five or ten bars that you think
are the best let us know in the comments
and if you disagree with something I
said let us know
let us know if you like protein bars
yeah I don't anymore after this
challenge so you guys never
[Music]
