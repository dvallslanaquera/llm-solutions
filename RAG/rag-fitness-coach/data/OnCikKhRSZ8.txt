[Music]
uh start of a depletion today um
it's saturday so it's the last uh day of
training
uh in this prep well last hard day
training
um so we're gonna do some a little bit
of calves
uh then do some pull downs
row variant uh some side delts
and that's about it very very low carbs
trace carbs loading up on sodium and
fluids
very like a target for those uh and i
run that
same depletion diet until tuesday
and then we start loading up on carbs uh
on
wednesday
[Music]
war war
uh three
i have another set of calves in eight
weeks
we'll go to some uh pulldowns
i think they have the mag grips i like
here so
i use that one
[Music]
charlie's really seemed to clean up his
technique after all my fucking shit
talking in the massing series
i'm just saying sometimes it does pay to
chastise people
[Music]
overall very positive uh last week being
out here in vegas i thought it was gonna
be a little stressful
but being here uh and having you know
mike
and jared here keep an eye on me
throughout training
and making sure i was doing what i
needed to do
and not doing what i shouldn't be doing
helped a lot
the only thing that would kind of the
disappointing outcome of this show
is if i somehow didn't
get nationally qualified i think very
low chance
of happening only because uh so many
people in each class qualify
let's go
we're doing some chest supported rows
kind of uh
finish off the back after those pull
downs
uh this will be the last heavy
[Music]
serious back movement of this whole
macro cycle leading up to this prep
so after this take maybe a 5-10 minute
break
and then hit some side belts
[Music]
i don't think there is any really
i would say negative outcome for me at
least because if
you know we roll through what we planned
out
for the depletion and carb up and
supplements throughout the show
and i come in you know not as dry
not as hard not as full etc etc
that's just data to use you know for the
next show which is the more important
[Music]
show
[Music]
people have been saying to me that you
know this whole prep
oh you're gonna kill it you're gonna win
it you're gonna win the overall etc etc
uh i hear it i go okay
i don't uh think about it much i don't
believe it
entertain it exactly
[Music]
oh hey guys
[Laughter]
so uh this is the last
movement of the heavy hard session of
this whole prep
uh finishing off with biceps uh
mike has something special in store for
me we're doing a rack run
um pretty much gonna start with a top
weight
hit it and i go down and wait across the
rack until he
tells me to stop this is gonna be fun
uh
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
you're gonna rest pause
[Music]
up
[Music]
feeling pretty good we'll see how i feel
later
after i get deeper into this first day
of depletion my first
real bodybuilding completion ever so i
don't know what to expect but we're
officially one week out
from stepping on stage all the hard
training is over
do depletion today tomorrow
monday tuesday and then wednesday we
start carving up
for the show uh have some lights
uh training on monday tuesday
very high rep uh very far from failure
just to get some extra completion
glycogen start coming up on
wednesday probably gonna start around
oh at least 1200 grams of carbs
and the next day at least
850 to 900 grams of carbs and then
friday played by air but likely
the plan is to do right around 650 grams
of carbs
but besides that we kind of just uh
roll into the show this prep solidified
in jared's mind in my mind that charlie
will be turning pro is just a matter of
time so
he just sits 511 235 pounds of striated
glutes
and his waist his quads his back his
everything
uh man it's just it's rare it's a rare
physique so
i wouldn't want to compete against him
and i wouldn't want any of my other
friends to compete against him if we
didn't know who he was
uh he's one of those guys that'll just
ruin your day you'll show up in a pump
up room and uh
damn it so it's uh it's exciting and i
think he's gonna do very well and if not
amazing in the show
eventually very amazing
you
