hey folks dr mike israetel here
renaissance periodization fat loss
dieting made simple lecture video number
eight
the maintenance phase all right let's
get into it so
last time we learned how to create an
effective fat loss diet and we learned
how to run one
in the real world with difficulties and
all and when you're done with your fat
loss diet you're leaner congratulations
but unfortunately there's a very good
chance your body is going to want to
come back
up to your old weight or somewhere
between your current and old weight
regaining is a pre-programmed
evolutionary mechanism
you're less likely to be as active want
to be as active rather
you want your body's going to make you
hungrier
you're going to want to crave all sorts
of tasty foods that add tons of calories
back in
most people will succumb to this but
because you're going to watch this video
you'll have less of a chance of
succumbing you're going to do all the
right stuff after the diet
to ensure that you keep as much of that
fat that you lost off for
a two infinity and beyond or for as long
as you want to keep it off so here's the
deal
when you are done with your fat loss
diet and here's the
biggest point of this entire lecture and
of this whole concept when you're done
dieting you're not done dieting
okay when you're done with your fat loss
diet you're not done dieting you switch
to a maintenance diet which means what
three things first step stick to your
diet foods
when you finish a diet some people can
handle like a cheat meal
but then back on your plan or don't even
take a cheat meal save that for later
there will be time for them
stick to your plan okay if you are done
dieting and you start having junk food
days on end or just eat whatever you
want which is
junk food days on end then you're going
to regain a ton of weight back it's
going to demoralize you you're going to
take in tons of water weight you're
going to buy fuck it you're going to go
back to eating normal and then you're
just it's all all downhill from there
so later you will have junk food but not
yet the biggest recommendation i can
give you is when your diet ends just eat
all your diet foods continuously
now your fat loss phase is over so
you're going to remove the deficit
you're going to remove the deficit
however your metabolism has probably
declined a bit you're lowering body
weight
so you're not going to put all of the
calories that you took out back
you're gonna put 50 of them back at
first
all right so if you were uh maintaining
at 3 000 calories that's where you
started your diet you ended your diet
last week was 2 000 calories
in week 1 of your maintenance you're
going to go to 2500 calories
okay that's it all of this addition
is in diet food still the same healthy
basics you were eating
which automatically is going to make you
be not very hungry or crazy because when
you have to eat like one and a half
times or some stuff the amount of pasta
or rice or whatever you're like
okay this is actually kind of tough to
eat or you'll be like wow this is great
to eat i'm not hungry i have tons of
energy great recovery is a foot
all right and then what you're going to
do is watch your body weight
you're automatically going to gain
something like two percent right away
just from the water
a recompartmentalization that occurs
right after you finish
the dieting process you're gonna gain
two percent no big deal
and then that's your new baseline
and anytime over the next several weeks
if you drop below that add in 250
calories
that's it so let's say you're 2500
calories
and you finish dieting at 100 pounds
it's just easy for me to do the mental
math and then
you at 102 pounds a week later and then
a week after that you come back down to
101 pounds
add in 250 calories and then you'll go
to 103 pounds
and then you'll be 102 because your
metabolism is firing up your activities
firing up everything's healing
four weeks later you might be back at
101 again
under 102. boom add in another 200 or
250 calories
if you go over and start climbing again
102 on a three 104
then you can take out the 250 that you
added and now you've probably found your
baseline
how many times you have to add in the
250 calories is entirely up to how
flexible your metabolism and your
activity and all the stuff is
some people they don't add anything they
just get to that midway point between
whatever
three thousand two thousand they get
2500 they stay there all is golden
for some people they get to 2 500 as an
example
and then they start losing and they go
27.50 and they start
losing and then they go 3000 to start
losing and they go 3250 and that's the
new maintenance who knows they made a
bunch of lifestyle changes added a bunch
of muscle
that's it you don't know where you are
until you try but this is an inner
iterative repetitive process that you do
if you drop below that
102 you add 250 cals and if you're there
over and climbing for a little while
like a week or longer then you just
subtract out the 250 and see restate
and sometimes you might have to add it
back in and play around for a while
right
step number four is stabilize and that's
not a step you do it's a step you
experience
so after three or four weeks in most
cases sometimes longer so no big deal
you won't have to make any adjustments
anymore because your body weight's
pretty stable
at just just right or right around that
102 percent
and even sometimes it can fall and you
sort of take your hands off and it
doesn't go any lower than 100 or 99 you
can just keep it that's good to go
you won't have to make any more
adjustments you won't really be hungry
or crazy anymore you just feel kind of
normal
right and you'll be eating at plenty of
plenty of diet food and maintaining it
below 102
of your end of diet weight awesome step
five is you start introducing junk which
often
happens three or four weeks later now
you can have some junk before if you go
right back to the plan
but if you want a super simple easy
approach that's going to give you the
best chance of success
wait for the junk until that
stabilization point occurs
then you can have a bit of junk if you
can check all the boxes in step four
and you can have a fun treat here there
big or small doesn't matter
and remain active if you're having
plenty of treats and your weight
trends up for two weeks like
considerably above the 102 percent
if for two weeks it's higher and it
looks like it's going up be easy on the
snacks a bit
and it'll probably go down or take your
dietary fats and reduce them and keep
more snacks in your call
but either way you end up at a really
normal
mostly healthy food diet with some
snacks here and there and you're
maintaining
voila and if the weight's going up a
little easy on the snacks if the weight
goes down add in snacks or add in more
whole food depending on how you like to
eat
so it's going to take three or four
weeks if not longer
for your weight to stabilize with the
reintroduction of junk food
so you didn't have junk food that's
three or four weeks
you added junk food that's another three
or four weeks for real true stability
that means this maintenance phase is
going to last months
and ideally to really put yourself ahead
of the game to make sure you're doing
everything you can to succeed
a maintenance phase should be roughly as
long as the diet that preceded it
so if you dieted for six weeks you do a
maintenance phase of six weeks
nine weeks nine weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks
so on and so forth
does that kind of suck yeah because
you're like i'm gonna be done dieting
in 12 weeks then i'll be free like a
bird to eat whatever
bullshit after 12 weeks you have another
12 weeks of
incrementally more freedom okay well
does that stink yeah kind of blows
does it give you the best advantages
long term for maintaining
your new lean physique that's exactly
what it's doing because here's the deal
like if you just want to get lean once
and then eat your way back up nobody's
stopping you but most people
dare i say almost all people who are
trying to lose fat they don't really
want that fat back
and this is the way to make sure it
happens correctly
so once you get through this process
your chances of keeping off the fat once
you get through a maintenance process
skyrocket look if you can maintain your
weight doing these steps
for 12 weeks after 12 week diet after
week 12 your chances of continuing to
maintain the weight indefinitely are
so much higher than if you just did one
week and you're like fuck it who cares
right as long as you eat mostly healthy
as long as you stay active
and keep an occasional eye on your
weight to pull back on the snacks a
little bit if it goes too high or add
some snacks in if it goes too low
you're good to go right if there's a
two-week period
you rain in your intake or two-week
period of gain rate in your intake
two-week period of loss
increase your intake that's it
maintenance is easy
as long as you just keep a little tiny
bit of an eye right
it's kind of like when you're learning
to drive it's really hard but once you
know how to drive
you don't fall asleep at the wheel but
like driving's not that hard because
someone's like
oh man you're going to drive 90 miles on
the freeway to see your friend like holy
shit bro like
what do you mean the freeway do this i
don't fall asleep but you gotta stay
awake
same with maintenance dining same with
maintenance time
all right so at this point you're done
you've successfully lost weight and
you've kept it off but
what if you have more weight to lose
because remember there's limits
to a fat loss phase the hard limits are
one percent per week
12 weeks at a time okay so if you weigh
200 pounds
your essentially hard limit is like 24
pounds per fat loss phase
but what if you're 200 pounds and your
goal and the doctor approves is healthy
and totally fine
is to get to 150 you're considerably
overweight for your frame
well you know 24 pounds later you're 176
pounds
and you're not 150 yet what do you do
because i'll tell you what the
temptation is you already know this
it's just to keep going you're like week
12 you're down to 176 and you look
around you're like
hell yeah i'm almost halfway there keep
going and you go 16 weeks 20 minutes
whatever
that is a good way to crash and burn
okay take the maintenance phase
do a good job with it all 12 weeks and
then later
you can start another fat loss phase the
details of that
sequential multi-phase dieting process
are going to be in our next video
i would say stay tuned but then you
would literally have to look at your
youtube for a week until we post the
next one
so i'll say see you next week
you
