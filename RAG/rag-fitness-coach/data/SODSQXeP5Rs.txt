there are people out there saying
females don't train hard enough there
are people out there saying males don't
train hard enough
carol dunn beat both males and females
the fuck up out of her way
took him up smashed his head into the
leg press poured his blood all over the
machine that was a black colored machine
before we started
that shit is blood it's another person's
blood carol is a freak
let's get it done
we are here with carol cantarero
and jared feather of course who has no
spanish name and uh what are we doing
today jared
so today we are training carol she is
actually an ifbb wellness pro she's
prepping for her pro debut
congratulations thank you and uh she
will be doing a hamstring and glute
emphasis session today which is you know
appropriate since
wellness is very heavily focused on the
glutes and hamstrings i've actually been
doing her training since she won her pro
card at
usa usa's last year so she won her pro
card
then she wanted to build a little bit
and uh i've been doing her programming
through that as well
so we're gonna put her through a little
session and see how she fares at
four weeks out five weeks four and a
half weeks out
yo you trying to train i am let's do it
[Music]
reverse hat good mornings three sets of
roughly seven to ten repetitions
why this and why not a barbell why not
smith machine why not camber bar they're
all valid variation
as long as they are loading the
hamstrings by you tilting your hips back
maintaining a neutral or arched lower
back never rounded because that
takes the tension off the hams it lets
them shorten too much
and it of course endangers your lower
back and we want to make sure that we
look at our knees
when the movement of the bar is doing
this we don't want our knees to bend to
because that doesn't let the hamstrings
receive tension
so a huge tip here is a three-parter
one is chest up two is butt back
the whole time and three is keep your
knees straight
not locked out just like this and then
as you bend
all three of those things apply you will
feel tension in the hams go down
super slow milk that deep stretch that's
where the growth comes from
come up nice and quick and repeat you'll
feel very little loading at the top but
that doesn't matter because this
exercise is specifically
designed to impose a great deal of
tension under the most stretch
let's get it done now real quick carol
is like
one of the most flexible human beings of
all time she's taken rom to the next
level
do only what you are able to with a
tight lower back
as soon as you start rounding over a lot
a little bit is okay
but if you round over a lot it's no good
don't worry about how deep you're going
make sure your hamstrings are painfully
tense
once that's the case then you can come
up
sit up go good carol you got another one
three three three go control control
hips hips yes slow
up
[Music]
[Applause]
i got it big chest up
yes
control control stitch back
up go go
let's go
big chest up
yes yes yes
reach out to the chest reach up the
chest
up breathe breathe breathe
big hair big chest hips back
yes let's go
[Music]
hips beautiful let's go
up much better
last one let's do it carol hips
hips and up let's go
go go beautiful good shit
[Music]
beautiful good stuff how does that feel
oh good good yeah we also do conclusions
now
she did a great job that's it for good
mornings
great job carol crazy technique we got
fried up hamstrings time to go hit the
glutes with lunges
oh hey guys you're always somewhere else
so lunges you can do lunges with a
relatively short step
not taking really long steps you know
one or two feet or something that tends
to hit the glutes plenty but it also
hits the quads a lot
we want longer steps to put a crazy
stretch
on that lead leg glutes and a crazy peak
contraction on the back leg glute
running man
that way we get an awesome glute
stimulus all the lunges are good and the
biggest rule
is do the step length that makes you
comfy that you feel strong with
that you feel the muscles that you're
targeting with but generally speaking
slightly longer is usually better for
the glutes however
don't do some shit that's so long you're
off balance and you can't even generate
force
long enough to hit the glutes a lot
short enough to get you lots of power
out of the bottom
gently touch the knee every single time
always gently touch to the ground or
almost to the ground
come up under control another quick
question a lot of people have is
do i carry the leg through or do i go
again so
just to demo this real quick if you're
carrying the leg through
when you're coming back out of the lunge
some people will just go
right into the next one or you can
stutter step it when you go here up
and then you go in okay there are no
right answers if you
feel comfortable okay like through
that's great some people especially
close to failure with heavy weight
get unstable if they have to go on one
leg that entire time
the swinging motion looks all cool and
athletic it doesn't really accomplish a
ton though so if you're comfortable
doing it awesome it gives you a really
good flow
if you want a stutter step bring your
leg in and then go
that is 100 fine let's get this done
multiple sets of lunges in the 10 to 20
rep range
we're going to try to do these heavy
chest up the entire time
the point is not just to lunge around
and use whatever part of your body you
can
good technique is always the key and
carol over here is
a master one more step each legit
make this rep perfect big chest
use the glute coming from that front
foot good
stuff feel it on your glutes more right
yeah good stuff
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
so the cue that i'm giving carol because
she's doing really wide steps wide steps
as mike said earlier they hit the glute
better so when you're stepping
most people tend to push really hard
with that back foot so you see guys
like there are famous videos of like
ronnie coleman doing 185 in the lunge
but when they lunge they're going like
this and they're really pushing off that
back foot
kind of like they're like trying to
sprint so when you step
you're trying to come up on this foot
it's really hard the barber on your back
so
when i see people using like 90 pounds
100 pounds i'm like dude you're
definitely not lunging correct
so you're coming up on this front foot
almost like a pistol squat
here and it makes it to where this leg
is getting the stimulus
the wider that step is the less weight
you're gonna be able to use and more
glute you're gonna be able to use
but it's gonna be really hard because
you're coming out here
to try and stand on this peg and come up
on that foot alone
it's very very hard and you get really
unbalanced so using a lot of weight it's
probably not necessary
off right yes good
front foot control control this foot too
step ctrl
carol did three sets of lunges
glutes blasted but not blasted enough
she looks like she could take a bit more
pain so it's going to be
wide stands sumo squats with a pause at
the bottom
for a ton of glute and a ton of adductor
and why not some quad 2
let's get it done
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
sumo squats last exercise probably about
three sets
anywhere between five and 15 reps we'll
see our fatigue is probably 10 to 15.
slow and controlled on the way down full
pause at the bottom
every single time you want to go as low
as you can
while keeping from rounding over now in
carol's case because she's a
total freak she can go ultra deep you
don't have to go as deep
just go as deep as you can until you
start to make almost round
and then come back up let's give it a
shot
[Music]
there it is big chest
hips open hips open
[Music]
up good again
open open open stop right there
ah better
the hips open it's open it's open it's
open it's open stop right
there don't bogus don't valgus good
crack
did you feel the valgus on that yeah six
are up yeah
but you're tired i know don't force it
into the quads though
yes all day carol these are fucking
perfect
big chests glutes yes pause just a
little longer yes
big chest get the glutes underneath you
as you push forward
push forward with the glutes yes good
big chest hips open carol it's open
you're good i'm right here no valgus
bullshit rep
close greatest shelf make these up
perfect
two you got him let's go
hips open hips open pause
use the clutch push push push yes
good shit oh
carol has had a lot of quad simulators
today but she's training legs three
times a week
and her upper volume is tailored such
that she's kind of bringing her upper
body down actually
um she's four weeks out the volume is is
slightly lower for the upper because
she's pretty jacked
and in wellness they want you to have
huge legs huge glutes
and a very tight small upper body so
we're actually going to be doing a
couple sets of leg press at the end of
all of this stuff that we just did
it's gonna seem like a lot of quad or a
leg volume in general
but most of our other days are uh glute
centric so she's doing a lot more glute
and a lot more hamstring on those days
so a couple sets of quads here at the
end uh i think throughout the week she
has you know eight
ten sets of quads total and then the
rest is like really hamstring glute but
we're gonna throw those two sets of leg
press in and
i think she's ready for it so
so leg press time two sets there's gonna
be one mile rep break between
or sorry within each one of the sets so
we're gonna go go go go
break three to five seconds of rest
she's gonna breathe a bit try not to die
pretty close to failure and then another
a couple of reps to finish off
she's gonna do that once that's a set
rack rest two or three minutes
come back do it again feel free to try
this at home
don't take it too far don't take like
five mile route breaks between each one
just do more sets
the quality of the reps the quality of
each stimulative portion of the rep
tends to degrade the fatigue tends to
elevate the more my rep
mini sets you do so i would say two to
three is probably the most you want to
do in most situations
that means you do a stretch rest do a
stretch
rest maybe do a stretch and then rack or
just rack after that first one
give it some thought carol is gonna work
her ass off on this
this is the kind of intensity want to
bring to the gym there are people out
there
saying females don't train hard enough
there are people out there saying males
don't train hard enough
carol done beat both males and females
the fuck up out of her way
took him off fucker smashed his head
into the leg press poured his blood all
over the machine that was a black
colored machine before we started
