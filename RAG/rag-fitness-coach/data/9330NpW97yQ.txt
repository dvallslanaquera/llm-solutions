hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization tackling a
very very common very controversial
question today
should you train for strength if your
goal
ultimately is maximum muscle size
should you train for strength to get
bigger
very very interesting let's take a look
at why maybe the answer is a yes
why maybe the answer is a no and find
some middle ground with some really good
solid recommendations
so when we say train for strength
we really mean training forward in
sports sciences called basic strength
sets of roughly three to six repetitions
to try to increase the amount of load
you can do
for sets of three to six repetitions
maybe that's good for hypertrophy let's
find out how
first point sets of five to eight reps
which is often used in strength training
and you know sets of five to six or
right in that range and sets you know
seven and eight still gets you some good
uh strength results are very
hypertrophic
especially for faster twitch fibers so
if you're training some faster twitch
muscles like the hamstrings
uh potentially the pecs and stuff like
that sets of five to eight reps
really do increase your strength in the
basic strength range and are
very very good for muscle hypertrophy so
there's a very good interaction there
when you're doing a low volume
maintenance phase to re-sensitize
yourself for future hypertrophic gains
it's low volume and you can use high
intensities and high loads
that's a really good time to do strength
training so if you want to take your low
volume maintenance phase and use it as a
strength
mesocycle that is totally good to go all
of a sudden
it fits right in so so far so good next
people who've trained in strength a lot
have a really really good technique
on the compounds squats benches
deadlifts rows pull-ups many former
power lifters who switched to some
bodybuilding
have excellent technique with excellent
range of motion and
unbelievable stability under heavy loads
because they needed all those things and
developed them with strength training
look
if you take someone that's never really
squatted very heavy before and you get
them to do sets of five to ten or
five to fifteen in the squat they could
have all sorts of weird technique
breakdown their core could be the
limiting factor they don't know how to
brace
you take a former power lifter they know
how to squat and heavy
and all of a sudden you just increase
the reps their technique is
fucking awesome because they know how to
handle themselves under heavy load
they know how to arch and retract in a
bench press they know how to brace
properly in a deadlift and keep the bar
close to their bodies
they're really just well oiled machines
in
which you inject more volume and all of
a sudden they grow super great
someone some of the easiest folks have
ever had the pleasure of training in
hypertrophy
are former current power lifters or
weight lifters because they
automatically know how to lift
really really well with a really stable
technique and because the loads are even
lighter
their technique doesn't break down when
they get to heavier to higher reps
because they're used to having their
technique
attempted to be broken down by super
heavy weights if you've squatted a shit
load of weight with really great
technique
in sets of three to six squatting was
set to eat it's just a bit more work
it's not that tough
but if you had someone who's done a
bunch of lunges leg presses and eye
extensions and now you have them squats
that's a five to ten
they could be a real cluster fuck so a
lot of times training for strength and
having a background of strength on the
compounds
just makes you really good at training
for higher volume hypertrophy work
in addition to that strength training
can make your core so strong that it's
no longer the limiting factor and lets
you train your target muscles better
for example power lifters when you have
them do bent over rows
from deadlifts their erector complex is
so strong
that the bent over rows are only going
to train the pulling muscles and not the
spinal erectors
the spinal raptors are so strong there's
no problem for them to keep you stable
but if you take someone who's just been
doing pull-ups and pull-downs and
machines
you have them do bent rows for the first
time and i've run into this training new
bodybuilders
their erectors are so weak because
they've never power lifted before
that they try to do bent rows and all of
a sudden they're just rounding over and
losing tension and you're like oh man
you're actually not strong enough to do
bent rows it's crazy but true
you got to do some deadlifts first to
get that core strength then you can do
bent rows
same idea with squats a strong man
or a power lifter or a weight lifter
when they do squats they're likely to be
limited by their legs
because their core is so strong it's not
a limiting factor but for bodybuilders
used to do in large extensions like
press and so on and so forth you put
them on the squat
they start folding over because they're
erectors and all the core musculature
their abs just
aren't strong enough and they don't have
the technique to go along with it
so strength training in some sense is
very good for hypertrophy and the lower
rep range just for the faster twitch
muscles
and it also prepares you it's really
good for low volume maintenance stuff
and it also seemingly prepares you
really well
for future hypertrophy gains more than
it helps directly but sure as hell
doesn't seem like it hurts that's on the
positive side
let's look at the negative side why
maybe not doing a lot of strength
training is optimal for hypertrophy
first direct growth from strength
training is relatively low so that's a
three to six don't grow you all that
much and in fact
if you just go down to point number
three there anything under sets of five
reps makes
very little sense from direct
hypertrophy right
it doesn't cause a lot of muscle growth
relatively how many sets you're doing
and it has a distinctly higher injury
risk and that's a big downside when
you're a bodybuilder
and you're training for strength you're
getting stronger
core strength three sensitization all
those good things when you got your 3rm
loaded in the squad or the deadlift for
the bench or the overhead press or
something
and you got a show coming up in 16 weeks
you think to yourself
how much would an injury on this really
hurt
my career the answer is like a lot now
if you're a power lifter or a strong man
or a weight lifter you have to train
heavy anyway so you say okay getting
injured would suck for my career but
there's no way out of this
like i have to do it anyway right it's
like saying a business trip takes a lot
of time but if your business is to go on
business trips
you have to do it but if you don't have
to go on a business trip why would you
same way a bodybuilder has okay
hypertrophy training to do
strength training might be a benefit but
if strength training is much riskier for
injury which it is
that hypertrophy training it just might
not be worth it and because the direct
growth stimulus is so low
relatively speaking to sets of five to
ten and especially 10 to 20 and 20 to 30
that just might not make a whole lot of
sense to do it because the trade-offs
are so nasty now you may think
some people will say there's some kind
of special growth advantage right
um two very heavy training and people
will say that
it's just not very likely that that's
the case people say things like you know
you only get traps like that by going
heavy
right only like only power lifters have
traps like that well
a lot of really high level bodybuilders
have more impressive traps than power
lifters
a lot of them don't go super heavy right
are some muscle groups better
heavy yeah but less than sets of six
probably not right sets of three to six
are great and can cause good hypertrophy
for your traps for example from
deadlifting or shrugs
but sets of five to ten are probably at
least as good
with lower fatigue so it starts to not
add up a ton
when you're trying to cram strength
training down hypertrophy training's
throat so to speak
some more problems you can alter your
technique to lift the most weight
and that tends to reduce the stimulus to
fatigue uh ratio
on the actual target muscles you're
trying to grow so
if you're squatting as much as you can
you position a squat low bar
you sit back more you open up your hips
more that doesn't grow the quads anymore
as a matter of fact if you had a
slightly closer stance
high bar position you let your knees
come forward a lot with a very upright
squat
you would actually grow your quads more
for the fatigue that you're getting
so a lot of times people get really
really into strength and say strength
size same thing right
and they start benching with a huge arch
no problem with that for competitive
power lifting but it's not the best
stimulus to fatigue racial way to get
big packs
they start to deadlift for the sumo
stance which it doesn't even train the
back as much anymore change your
adductors a lot most bodybuilders that's
not a problem because they do so much
lag workout the adductors are never
weakness
and then they'll do squats with lower
position and sort of not even full range
of motion anymore just below parallel
which is great but probably going deeper
it puts an extra stretch on the quads
and all of a sudden they're chasing
strength and they get some good size
along with it
but if they're really interested in
optimal size with a really great
stimulus to fatigue ratio they wouldn't
train
for strength a lot of times because the
technique is so different
lastly there's a notion the only way to
describe it as a notion
that naturals need to get stronger and
drug users
enhanced people don't uh in order to
gain size and be like well metabolites
and drop sets and volume that all stuff
works for drug users
but naturals need to get stronger on the
basic lifts that's the only way they put
on size
i call this first rate make believe
somebody just made that up and somebody
else
thought it made some sense and just kept
repeating it this
so first of all drug users and non-drug
users fundamentally the hypertrophy
pathways are identical there are some
slight differences in training
application but it's a fucking moot
point
second of all if getting stronger in the
right rep ranges which we'll get to in a
second
wasn't what grew the people that used
drugs the most
how the hell come all the drug users
benching inclines with the 180s
okay ronnie coleman's out there
deadlifting 800 pounds everyone's using
these crazy heavy weights
for higher reps that maybe you should
have told them that if they just do tons
of submaximal volume and drop sets
they'll get just as big why do you think
bodybuilders beat themselves up with
super
crazy weights because fundamentally
everyone needs to get stronger in the
right rep range
that applies to naturals just as well as
it doesn't enhance individuals
there's some data to indicate that
if you're enhanced maybe your slower
twitch fibers grow a little bit better
relative to your faster church fibers
maybe in that higher rep training
can be a little bit more beneficial for
you than average but as we'll see in the
next slide that still means you need to
get stronger in the higher rep ranges
that doesn't take you away
so the idea that naturals should train
for strength but
uh you know really train for strength
and it's really if you're natural
training for strength is really really
awesome and a really big part of
hypertrophy
much more so than for enhanced people
that's just not true
somebody made that up and i think a lot
of the reason people made that up is
because a lot of naturals do both
powerlifting and bodybuilding
and they sort of want to i don't want to
say pretend they sort of
want there to be more concordance
between those two things than there
really are and there's a lot
but there's limits to that sort of thing
okay
taking all that in we've got some good
reasons to use strength training for
hypertrophy and we've got some reasons
why maybe it's not a good idea
where do we go from here well here's the
deal at the end of the day you're going
to spend the vast majority of your time
as a hypertrophy trainee in the 5 to 30
rep range
okay under 5 not really a good idea
because yeah you can get stronger in the
5 to 10 rep range and that's really
pretty close to basic strength
but as long as you when you start
training sets of 4 3 2 and 1
the trade-offs are just usually too big
and the direct benefit is usually too
small
now training hard in the five to thirty
rep range will make you stronger
across the whole five to three airplanes
so here's the deal
a lot of folks when they see this
presentation title should you train for
strength to get bigger will be like of
course you need to get stronger and the
rep ranges are training yes
but specifically in sports science
training for strength and how a lot of
people colloquially understand strength
training is like training for sets of
three to six
for that not as much but everywhere in
this five to
30 rep range you should be getting
stronger over time you're best out of 25
your best out of 10 your best set of
five should always be on average every
meza cycle or every block
going up and up and up and up so you
should be training to get stronger
but that's not exactly the same thing as
training for basic strength and sport
science and for sure not
because we're leaving the concept out
there's a concept called limit strength
or max strength that's training 1rm that
has even more downsides than training
for basic strength
but very few people are saying look you
need to do a lot of monorams to get
jacked and if they are
they're really fucking wrong and there's
not much to say about that here's the
thing
strength is a great size indicator
more than it progresses size it's an
indicator that you're getting bigger
because bigger muscles can produce more
force if your muscles have grown what
they used to do for sets of 20 is now
they can do it for sets of 25 and the
new sets of 20 is
more weight so if you're gaining
mesoderm especially block to block in
the 5 to 30 rep range you're gaining
strength
that's awesome you're probably gaining
size if you're not gaining strength
if you say if you take this too far and
go look bro dr mike said strength size
training is totally fucking different
and i don't have to do any strength
training and someone's like hey like
how's your bent row has it been going up
over time like did you hear what i said
bro dr mike says strength training is
irrelevant doesn't matter how strong you
are all that matters is you feel get the
fuck out of here with that shit you
should be gaining strength over time
what do you do you focus on great
technique in the hypertrophy movements
and you push hard in the 5 to 30 rep
range
for multiple sets and you let your
rising strength over time
tell you that you're gaining muscle and
if your strength is not rising over time
either not trying hard enough or
something is woefully wrong
and you're not actually getting more
jacked give that some thought
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
time
