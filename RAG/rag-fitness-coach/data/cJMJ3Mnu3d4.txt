hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and i'm here to talk to
you about a super important public
service announcement
eating fruit is a really good idea here
is your quick tip for today
fruit has somewhat of a bad name
especially in the bodybuilding community
for a reason that's not that great but
is understandable we'll get to in a bit
benefits of eating fruit here we go i
know of at least four
first fruits have an incredibly low
calorie density
so you can eat fruit on basically any
kind of diet unless you're eating like
10 calories a day so
if you have like 50 grams of protein in
a meal
25 grams of carbs like you're not gonna
put you know
two-thirds of a cup of rice
in your fucking plate because it's like
it's depressing first of all and second
of all you eat two spoonfuls of it and
it's gone and you're like god damn it
i'm so fucking hungry
low calorie density you can have you
know 25 grams of carbs it's like an
apple and a half or some shit like that
or a very large apple it's awesome right
next benefit
fruits have a very high satiety level
they cause a ton of fullness for how
many calories they bring in it's out of
this world fruits are only second to
like vegetables
there's only so much broccoli you can
eat so for example if you're like oh man
i have 62 grams of carbs what am i gonna
eat you eat three peaches that's like 60
grams of carbs by peach number two and a
half you're like
fuck i still have to eat more i was done
i was over this meal hours ago fuck this
so it's really awesome if you're on a
diet fruits fill you up it's amazing
third micronutrients fruits are chock
full with vitamins minerals
phytochemicals and fiber every now and
again when insane low carb or carnivore
people where the fuck they call
themselves nowadays or like fruits are
terrible for you i'm like motherfucker
have you ever seen anything in nutrition
like fruits are like a health elixir
right so they're awesome for you to eat
they're super healthy i will say
uh this rule doesn't always apply but i
see 97 of the time
if someone you consider a person to
listen to a nutrition tells you fruits
are bad for your health you kind of
excuse yourself the fuck out of that
conversation and walk out the door it's
like you're at your doctor's office and
he's like you gotta cut out your fresh
fruit intake you're like oh you know um
i think i hear something in the parking
lot and he's like what do you hear like
anything else other than your dumb ass
tell me some stupid bullshit rip off
that fucking blood pressure cuff
punch the doctor in the face not hard
just enough to let him know you mean
business
that's me quoting uh maddox uh best page
in the universe guy i'm an unbelievably
huge fan of you maddox if you buy some
miracle watching this
i love you
number four
fruits especially on a diet
our unbelievable sweet tooth medicine
like when you're on a fat loss diet
you want to eat some sweets you see a
commercial about brownies and you're
like you know i'm just i made some kind
of mistake in my life when i decided to
do a fat loss diet because i can't have
brownies and yeah look i'm not gonna
bullshit you
fruits do not taste as good as brownies
a subjective fact
actually i got into an online discussion
back in the days like 2010
where
i was it was an uh sort of sociological
economic discussion
where this person was saying like the
reason that people eat candy and cookies
and brownies it's just like big
corporations trick them into it and i
was like oh you know i think they eat
them because it tastes fucking great and
it does bullshit like fresh raspberries
and walnuts taste better i'm like look i
love fresh raspberries and walnuts
like you feed 100 people all across the
world
a fucking walnut brownie versus like a
handful of fresh raspberries and walnuts
come on man
this should taste amazing however
however
being that you can't have fucking
brownies when you're on a fucking nasty
fat loss diet hey fruits are awesome and
when you're on a fat loss diet your
sweet tooth is so outrageous that fruits
taste way better than they normally do
and they can really check that box so
you know it doesn't have to be all
broccoli and rice
take out some rice
throw in some fruit and all of a sudden
you have an awesome super healthy plate
that's more filling and it checks the
box for the sweet tooth and it just
makes your diet more pleasant and more
sustainable win win win win win
here's the thing fresh fruit is what i'm
talking about
all these things as you said apply to
fresh fruit the most and everything down
processing the least fruit juice does
not count says hello fruit's great dr
mike said i should drink 10 gallons of
orange juice a day don't fucking do that
lastly yes chronic ultra high fructose
intake is probably not great for your
health
or your body composition it probably
makes you a little fatter and maybe even
less muscular with chronic inflammation
if you really overdo it but it is
unbelievably unlikely with fresh fruit
consumption the amount of fresh fruit
you'd have to have to go over your daily
fructose target until it starts to spill
over and cause bad effects it's like
more fruit than most people can
consistently eat so
eat fresh fruits
your fucking parents when they were
raising you weren't lying fresh fruits
and veggies are the shit do they taste
as good as actual snack foods fuck no
but when you're a fat loss diet you're
trying to be an adult about how you eat
they're a really great choice folks i'll
see you next time and hopefully i'll be
eating a walnut brownie
you
