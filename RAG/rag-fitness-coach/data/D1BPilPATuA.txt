hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today's video will be asking the
question
of when should you use intensity
techniques like maya reps and drop sets
and supersets versus
when you should do straight sets just
like sets of 8 or 10 or 12
rest a normal amount of time and then
begin another set close to failure
so here's the thing straight sets really
are the default in training and should
compose most of your training
why because your faster fibers
your fastest twitch motor units grow the
most from training
and straight sets allow you to make sure
that your faster fibers are stimulated
in each set
and then relax and rest so that the next
set
again pushes them close to failure if
you had let's say one continuous set of
50 reps
where you started with your one rep max
and then some kind of machine adjusted
to the next one is your two rep max and
the next is your three rep max
and the machine automatically lowered
your load all the way until the last one
is let's say your 30 rep max
right so every set is close to failure
after about
g whiz you know 10 reps your fastest
twitch fibers are just off they're just
not doing anything anymore and the rest
is really just slow twitch fibers
so if you just did instead of five sets
of 10
if you did a set of 50 reps all the way
to failure with the load adjusted
automatically
all the way through the percent of
faster twitch growth from that would be
quite small the first set of 10 would be
decent after that garbage
but for the five sets of 10 because you
get breaks every time you get to hit
your faster fibers anew
this is also helped by the fact that
systemic factors
get a chance to recover between straight
sets
as you're doing your 25 rm it's really
not your 25 rm anymore
if you were fresher it's your 25 rm
having done all the other arms before
that
so your systemic fatigue is now crazy
high
your brain's ability to really tell your
muscles to go with all the pain and the
lactic acid and so on and so forth
and just the nerves literally run out of
the raw materials with which they send
their signals
you end up going to nervous system
failure before you actually hit local
muscle failure so the muscles themselves
are not getting stimulated not getting
as recruited nearly as they could be
but if you did a hard set and then took
a break your systemic fatigue falls
falls
falls falls and the potential for you to
on the next set
really hit your target muscles close to
their failure
is way higher so if you do exclusively
like the ultimate
drop set intensity technique then it's
just not very efficient to get your
fastest switch fibers
fresh over and over and over to
stimulate the most possible growth
right that's why straight sets generally
a really good idea
but intensity techniques so to speak my
reps drop sets against supersets
occlusion and stuff
they can work really well just under
certain circumstances so
when are those circumstances when are
intensity techniques
okay to use here we go number one
this is a list of first of all so
number one and two are requirements
number one for sure number two you'll
see is mostly requirement
numbers three and four are suggestions
to get better results number one as a
requirement and here it is when you're
using on a certain muscle or certain
exercise
an intensity technique like a drop set
or superset it has to pass the four
factor rest checklist we've talked about
in other videos what do we mean by that
your later sets for example in myo reps
every single my rep set after the first
set of let's say 10 to 20
has to be above five reps if you start
dropping in your sets below five reps
they're not adequately hypertrophic
if you're doing a cable extension to
push up superset and you do
a set of ten cable extensions and then a
set of two push-ups
that set of two push-ups is really just
not doing a whole lot
so as long as each one of the sets the
first part of the superset and the
second part is at least five reps
you're good to go okay so it has to meet
the five rep checklist
if you're doing drop sets or my reps or
anything like that you're doing sets of
one or sets of two
no good okay it has to be at least five
next
the exercise cannot be limited by your
cardio abilities it has to be limited by
local muscle fatigue so
drop sets of squats are stupid i've done
them before they're stupid
why because after the third drop set of
squats you just
and you're limited by your ability to
breathe and get oxygen to the working
tissues and to get wastes out
and not the actual local muscle's
failure point and fatigue
however so so drop sets on squats
intensity techniques on squats as you'll
notice from most people's experience
almost everyone squats in straight sets
because you need the rest
right it turns into cardio after a while
what kind of exercises though
can continue to be limited by the local
muscle even though you're not taking
long rest breaks as is typical with
intensity techniques well let's say
cable curls
who the hell runs out of oxygen on cable
curls right you go super close to
failure
and then your training partner takes it
down and you know puts it into the next
rack
again and you're going hey another set
of sticks okay and then you're going
you're not running out of air the entire
time because the biceps just don't
generate a whole lot of systemic fatigue
they don't require a whole lot of
metabolites
to be sequestered for your entire body
it's not a big deal
but it's a case-by-case basis can you do
machine rows
that's up to you some people fill cardio
out on machine rows with a drop set for
some people it's totally fine
if you're a really high body fat you
might not be able to handle the cardio
if you're a low body fat you might so
this changes just make sure you're
honest with yourself
when you're pushing your target muscle
hard with intensity techniques
your failure is getting close because
the target muscle is no longer willing
to contract for you
because they're really zapped not
because your cardio is off next one is
the neural component
in general this includes both physical
ability of the nervous system to act and
psychology
if you're basically not trying hard
anymore
on a drop set because your brain's just
like like we're done
that's not good it's better to rest
really get your mojo back
psychologically and hit another fucking
heart set
but if the entire time during a drops
you're psychologically in it no problem
and you don't feel this just sense of
total body fatigue and inability to even
get your muscles to be going
then you know you're totally good to go
right so
again it's it's a personal judgment if
you feel like a drop set of squats just
zaps your psychology and you're just not
trying because of the incredible pain
or the incredible total fatigue you know
drops out of squat's not a great idea
but if you're doing drop sets of forearm
curls and you're just in the entire time
and your muscles are what's limiting you
and it hurts locally but you're driving
no big deal drop sets and stuff like
that are totally fine lastly
are synergists getting in the way and
are they failing before other muscles
the easy example here is squats if you
try to drop sets of squats
right and what ends up happening is your
lower back tires usually before your
legs do
and that becomes a limiting factor you
rack the weight like oh i'm done i can't
do any more ups with this load and
someone's like quads right you're like
actually my lower back
right i'm just starting to round over i
can't use my back as seizing up on me
that's not good right but in let's say
machine or
here's another even better example uh
super higher back to back to back
you know drop sets or maya reps of bent
rows after a while it's just your spinal
erectors
you can't even get in position anymore
so your lats and your rhomboids and
chairs major the targets of your actual
training your mid traps
might be like totally fine but your
spinal director's like we can't do this
anymore
which is why maybe drops and stuff like
that are better on a machine row
with a chest support your erectors are
taken out of the equation then you can
take all the actual muscles to failure
so if you're asking yourself is this
exercise that i'm using conducive to
intensity techniques you have to ask if
i do the intensity technique and
sometimes if you don't know you can try
and say okay yes or no but basically you
ask
am i going to get at least sets of five
on this even in the breakdown many sense
is my cardio going to be a limiting
factor if not okay is my neural
especially psychological
ability going to be a limiting factor or
can i crank out hard reps to the target
muscle and lastly are soon are just
going to get in the way are they not
if the case is that oh you pass all the
four factor checklist you're good to go
that exercise is conducive
to doing intensity techniques but if it
doesn't then it's not you'll notice
barbell rows squats overhead presses
bench presses and stuff like that they
usually don't pass the four factor
checklist
if you're applying it to intensity
techniques like occlusion or bioreps or
drop sets or supersets
they only pass the four factor checklist
if you're doing straight sets
which means they're better than straight
sets but other exercises will do both
right and you can do them as straight
sets like cable curls you can do
straight sets of cable curls
or you can do drop sets occlusion so on
and so forth that brings us to the next
one
when you compare straight sets with an
exercise versus the intensity techniques
which one tends to have the higher
stimulus to fatigue ratio because it
could be a thing that straight sets of
cable curls are pretty good
but if you do my reps of cable curls
that may even be better in stimulus to
fatigue ratio and then
you definitely use it but it should at
least be comparable
right you get a high tension and burn
pump and disruption in the target muscle
when you do intensity techniques with
this exercise versus straight sets at
least as good or close to as good
you have low joint and connective tissue
fatigue your rp rating perceived
exertion isn't insane in relation to how
much stimulus you're getting
and you don't get a ton of systemic
spillover fatigue like there's another
one where
drop sets of squats take a huge hit
after a drop set of squats you may be
done for like two days lifting
is it worth it no if you did four sets
of uh regular straight sets of squats
you might get an even better quad
stimulus and feel totally fine after
definitely not worth it on that one
right
and here's the thing
very often that more faster fibers
compose a certain muscle
the lower its sfr will be for intensity
techniques and the better
sfr will be for straight sets hamstrings
are very often a more faster twitch
muscle for more people
how often do you hear about people doing
drop sets for hamstrings meyer reps
super sets
it happens and sometimes it's effective
but like for stiff-legged deadlifts and
good mornings and stuff like that
straight sets of like eight fuck your
hamstrings up more than anything in this
world
whereas like for more slower twitch
muscles like rear delts or side delts
training side delts with no drop sets or
supersets or anything like that
sometimes it's just like
i don't know like it's actually better
to train them with drop sets and
supersets and stuff like that
because it really zones in on them
because a lot of times they have
higher slower twitch muscle
concentration and the slower twitch
fibers
really do prefer the intensity
techniques more than the faster
fibers do and vice versa number three
really good idea if you're gonna do
intensity it needs to do towards the end
of a session
why well by the end of a session the
faster fibers have really just filled up
on their growth stimulus completely
because they actually have lower uh
they have a higher sensitivity to growth
and they have a lower
requisite volume a lower mav maximum
adaptive volume they just don't need as
much work
but your slower fibers may not have
gotten as much work
and remember these intensities usually
target the slower twitch fibers more
than the faster twitch fibers
so at the end of the session your slow
your faster fibers are done anyway and
it's okay if they're not the limiting
factor
now it's time to really hit the slower
twitch fibers up and get a complete
stimulus
and they think okay but like these
intensity techniques often cause crazy
high levels of systemic fatigue
and don't allow me to train hard after i
do them like after you know a bunch of
maya reps like you're done for the day
well that's okay if it's at the end of
the session because you gotta know where
you're done right
so don't do them at the beginning of a
session do them at the end so the faster
church fibers i've had all the work
already
now we hammer the slower twitch fibers
generate a ton of fatigue and go home
totally good idea that's more of a
recommendation but
it's not one that i would violate okay
you could try it yourself if you do a
drop set of squats first in your workout
that's not work out
if you do a drop set of leg presses at
the end of your workout proper exercise
selection
that's actually a really good workout
you really put the hammer on the quads
and then you're good to go
and lastly you probably want to do more
of these things when you're doing the
higher rep sets more metabolite work
towards the end
of a training block so in mesocycle one
of a three mesocycle training block gee
you know you do these things they
generate a ton of fatigue
and also they don't tend to work for
very long they work really well for
about a mesocycle
and then your body gets so much better
at clearing lactate
uh and buffering all the ions that it
takes way way more work to do the same
thing
and you don't get as big of a pump as
much of a metabolite sequestration and
all that hypertrophy
is not as impressive we should probably
save more of that stuff for like
mesocycle three
of a three meso progression really put
the hammer down and then back off
after that's when lighter loads are
employed anyway and growth resistance
is okay to max out because after a
mesocycle of lots of intensity
techniques
you just have nothing to give your
body's very resistant to growth
and the systemic fatigue super high good
news your next mesoafter
is active rest or resensitization where
you bring your body back together
and then grow again so save this kind of
stuff for not just the end of sessions
but the end of blocks of training the
last meso before you really take it easy
is a good idea has to pass the four
factor checklist and
more often than not if you're asking
yourself should i do this
next exercise intensity technique style
like with my reps or drops or
something or straight sets ask which one
of those is going to give you the
highest stimulus to fatigue ratio
and go with that folks thanks for tuning
in see you next time
