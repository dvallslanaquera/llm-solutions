and I would not suggest steroids to
anyone unless you want to be a you want
to take your to the next level you
already have your training your diet
together absolutely great advice don't
use steroids until you have your
training and your diet and everything
really squared away because then for
that super boost you're in the right
position to accept it but if you're just
using steroids to get to some place you
actually successfully get to just
looking like you lift and then people
are like oh well you're drug free you
have so much ahead of you and you're
like well actually no I'm already on
steroids instead of putting in the
effort on food on quality and on rest
and relaxation I put it into drugs first
bad idea
