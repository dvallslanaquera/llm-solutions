hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization rp
plus hypertrophy concepts and
tools 23
phase potentiation of frequency
let's take a look at what's in store
quick face potentiation review
you should be watching this after
lectures 21 and 22 so you should be very
fresh in your mind as far as what face
potentiation is for
we're going to talk about frequency
needs at the beginning of a block
frequency needs changing as the block
progresses
block being like three mesocycles or so
in a row
an issue with high frequency and
sustainability
and then how frequency should change
over the block and then of course
what frequency should look like in the
maintenance phase to really round out
our holistic
uh discussion of what a frequency should
look like over something like the macro
cycle which is to say
a few training blocks at least one
actual accumulative training block and
then a maintenance training block
all right so face potentiation remember
each phase has its own goals
but each phase also sets up the next
phase so anytime we want to design
a good training program we want to make
sure that anything we're doing right now
works well for growing muscle now but
also is attuned to
how do we grow muscle in the next phase
so there needs to be some sort of
structure
to lead in think of this as like an
appetizer main course dessert sort of
thing
order matters and your appetizer can be
the greatest thing in the world but it
fills you too much
for your main course it kind of ruins
the meal experience and if the dessert
is paired poorly to the main
course meal then it kind of just falls a
kind of a dud so you want everything to
sort of
work off of each other okay and how does
this apply to frequency and a perfect
train you've already seen it
apply to volume we've already seen it
apply to load we're going to see here in
frequency
today that there's a really really cool
synthesis of concepts that occurs
and makes this face potentiation id and
hypertrophy
actually pretty cool so there's some
debate between various fitness experts
on you know is periodization required
for perturbing
absolutely not required to get some
hypertrophy actually quite a lot
but i think for optimization of
hypertrophy if you really want to give
it your best effort you know all these
things intellectually
you know periodization in a sense that
people understand it to be the use of
face potentiation which is
a big part of periodization uh really
does seem to have some merits to it at
least something to think about
so frequency needs at the beginning of
the block
when you are starting a block a mountain
cycle one your fresh after maintenance
phase or active rest phase
your per session minimum effective
volumes are very low you can do like
three or four sets per session per
muscle group and grow super great
awesome
your per week minimum effective volumes
are very low as well which is really
really good
and recovery between sessions at the
beginning of the block
probably takes quite a long time because
you grow more muscle
after any exposure of training because
you're so sensitive to muscle growth
after you do any one session the muscle
growth curve lasts for quite a long time
at the beginning
of a training block at the end of meso3
it might last for a very short time
because you're pretty resistant to
anabolism at that point
in addition to that you have a higher
percentage of faster twitch behaving
fibers and
a lot of the loading you're doing is
heavier relatively so
uh you know your fatigue reduction
doesn't occur
very quickly because faster fibers don't
drop fatigue very fast between sessions
and heavier loading also doesn't drop
fatigue very fast
so you lower frequency actually makes a
little bit more sense because each
session
can be minimal in size it can really
mess you up and take quite a while for
you to
heal for your next productive relatively
faster twitch oriented
relatively heavier weight session in
addition to that your work capacity
is dog shit which is kind of a good
thing from the last phase of active
recovery or maintenance your work
capacity has come down quite a bit
so you don't even have the capacity to
do a ton of work
uh which just means to justify a super
high frequency environment there's only
so much work you can do per week
and your recovery ability really really
pairs well with your work capacity so
you just can't recover from super high
frequencies
nor do you need to do them thus to grow
a lot of muscle
in the first block at the beginning
sorry the first mezzo at the beginning
of a block of training of three meso
sequence you simply don't need very high
frequencies at the beginning of the
block you just don't
right now as the block progresses as you
go from other one to meso2 and mesotwood
and meso3
frequency needs may change for a few
reasons
your per session minimum effective
volumes and
mrvs increase for sure but your per week
minimum effective volumes and mrvs
definitely increase
and if you have you know certain
sessions
in number let's say three sessions you
do an average of eight reps
and then oh sorry eight sets so three
sessions eight sets
and your mrv is 24 great that fills you
right up
but if your mrv is like 30 gee whiz you
know
you're gonna have to increase how much
volume you do per session and there's
only so much you can do that you might
need to add sessions
to that exact point the mavs per session
might not increase much you still may
get your maximum adaptive volume
later in the mesocycle and later in the
block at
roughly sort of eight to ten cents per
session
but your mrvs for the week
uh and your mevs go up so
in order to chase truly as much training
as you can productively mrv
and in order to do as much training as
you minimally need to grow and any v
you might need to raise your training
volume but your mav your maximum
adaptive volume per session might just
not change much so just like with the
last example if you're doing like eight
sets per session
and all of a sudden your mev is like 20
where it was 15
gee you know you're pretty close to your
mav with just eight sets per session for
the week
if you added frequency you could really
bust up your volume without touching per
session mav
so each session you still do eight but
now you do four sessions instead of
three that's 32
that means even if your mev is in the
20s now you're well clear of it and if
your mrv is in the 30s you're getting
closer to it both of those are good
things
right and another piece of sort of good
news
your recovery between sessions becomes
more rapid as you train from one mason
to the mazzo to the mezzo
for a couple of reasons your fibers as
mentioned before convert to more slower
twitch variants which tend to recover
faster
sort of uh silver lining there your work
capacity goes up
incredibly because you've been doing
incrementally higher volumes for
multiple weeks
and then multiple months at this point
your work capacity goes up which is good
because you can actually do the work
right your technique improves thus your
efficiency improves
and you can do more work effectively
without straining joint structures or
getting really tired and so on and so
forth
and thus you can do more frequency as
the training block progresses and
actually benefit so if you did a ton of
frequency and
block the first mesocycle of the block
you might not even be able to pull it
off all that well
whereas if you do it more frequency in
the second and more in the third
you might be realizing that all of the
uh
sort of structures and all of the
limitations are going to your favor
actually letting you perform higher
frequencies when you need them right
so not only do you need a bit more
frequency as the block progresses for
the best gains
you can usually support it better as uh
your frequency as the block wears on
your potential for doing frequency and
pulling it off actually goes up which is
a really really good thing
now it doesn't go up at all capacities
ideally
joint and connective tissue stress would
fall during the block and then we could
really do high frequencies
but not all things line up but most of
them do line up pretty well
especially when you consider needs
versus abilities could you do higher
frequency in the first
uh block yes but you might not need to
and you really need to
in the uh sorry in the first meso and uh
keep locking that up my apologies and
the first meso you can do high frequency
potentially but you don't need it at the
very least
and then in the last meso you might not
be ideal for higher frequency but pretty
good at it and you need it so it's kind
of a double-edged sword there
in the same direction now that whole
issue with
okay you could do higher frequency in
the first
mesocycle you just do higher frequency
in the whole block a high frequency is
really really great
right here's the problem earlier in the
block meso1 for example
you don't actually need higher frequency
you just can't benefit from it much
because your cap on recovery and your
minimum effective volume
are so low that you can fill in all of
your growth effects with relatively low
frequencies you just don't get a big
bang for your buck
adding frequency works if you're already
used to a lower frequency
but you're not used to low frequency yet
you're still milking it out right so
you know why do it right but maybe you
do it anyway because it's more effective
okay uh maybe even just by a tiny little
amount
well later in the block you can benefit
even more for high frequency so if
there's any variation of novelty and
sometimes they say
high frequency is better just because of
novelty that's not true exactly but
novelty definitely helps
um at least you want to save the higher
frequencies for later in the block will
you really really need them not just use
them all the time
but there's a better argument because
higher frequencies create
much more cumulative fatigue if you use
them than lower frequencies through at
least two ways one
higher frequencies uh impact joint and
connective tissue recovery more than
lower frequencies do they're less
sustainable
so over the course of applying high
frequency training for a long enough
time
joint and connective tissue recovery
starts to
really really be limiting versus if you
do lower frequency all the time you can
train for way longer with joints
connective tissues being just fine
and another thing about high frequencies
is one of the ways in which they benefit
you
they let you grow is they allow you to
do more volume in the week
but that more volume means you get
closer to your weekly systemic mrv
remember like you your individual
muscles may recover uh
from four sessions just fine or two
sessions just fine
but two extra sessions a week impacts
the system that much more
so all of a sudden you can make this
napoleonic plan of i'm gonna train 14
times a week with two a days and three
days get through one week and
oh my god my body system can't recover
from this much training
so if you do you know when you don't
really need it if you do the higher
frequency
it might end up being that by the second
or third mesocycle you're systemically
overreached
so it's just not sustainable from that
perspective right so we can look at
higher frequency as an effective tool
but an expensive tool that works ideally
for a limited time
before lower frequencies have to be done
to recover
because they are more sustainable and
they don't have all these fatiguing
effects
so where do we go from here well we
don't seem to really need
to come close to optimization higher
frequency in the beginning of the block
but we really seem to be able to benefit
from it a lot and
because volume requirements
and volume opportunities rise as the
block goes on
uh higher frequencies might be something
we can
not only benefit more from as we go for
messenger measurement
but something that we can absolutely
benefit from because it becomes almost
required to be the thing that
provides overload for us so what we can
do there is add frequency as the block
progresses
we can start at lower frequencies and
work to higher ones uh
both as needed like okay well clearly
you know we're just not getting a huge
hit off of 16 sets
of back anymore i think it's time to
move up to a higher volume and we can't
do it with two sessions time to do three
and as sustainable you say okay can i do
three sessions of back now that i've
maxed out two like yeah totally joint
connective issues are fine
if i just choose exercises and loading
ranges intelligently i can absolutely
add a third session
so if it's sustainable and if it's
needed then you can add frequency and
that's huge and we're going to come back
to that a little bit
you don't just add frequency proactively
and be like i'm going to do everything
four times a week then five then six
like that might not actually work out
because it might not be needed
uh nor might it nor might it not be
sustainable right
and then what that means is we do our
highest frequencies
and thus our least sustainable ones at
the last mesocycle of a block
uh and then move into active raster
maintenance where all that crazy fatigue
is brought down which is a really good
thing if we did
high frequencies every single measure of
a block we would never finish the block
or not nearly as productively
and in order to make this process more
effective
we can make our higher frequencies more
sustainable
by adding less systemically fatiguing
exercises as we go
or fewer of them rather to be good at
the english language
we can add lighter loads and moderate
loads more than heavy loads
uh and the best of all worlds we can
just do some combination of both
so i think let's look at some examples
of that
right so frequency changes over the
block might look like this
for triceps in each mesocycle of the
block you might go from
two sessions of triceps a week in the
first mesocycle
to three sessions in the second and then
four sessions in the last mesocycle
all right in let's say
in meso one you know you're doing
two heavy compound exercises for triceps
close grip benches and dips for example
in meso2 you might add um
10 to 20 rep skull crushers so like you
used to train
monday thursday triceps and you did dips
and close grip benches monday thursday
all right dips on monday close to badges
on thursday
which you might do in mesocycle 2 is now
you train
for your triceps monday wednesday friday
dips monday just like before close grip
bench is wednesday this time but
remember you're healing faster because
you're more adapted high work capacity
slower fiber type
splits so on and so forth and then on
that friday you add
10 to 20 rep skull crushers more of an
isolation movement not super
taxing on joints not super systemically
fatiguing and it's
a higher rep range so it's totally
possible to do and then lastly
you in meso 3 in the last meso might
do you know another session on saturday
for triceps and that's four sessions a
week
and you add sets of 20 to 30 in a
cable tricep extension drop set so you
know set of 20 to 30 and then you drop a
little and another set of five to ten
drop five to ten drop
five to ten so what that ends up
happening is that exercise is very not
systemically fatiguing
really locally fatigued into the triceps
it's much lighter weight so it's not a
joint problem
can you sustain that four time a week
tricep training frequency
in other words can you hit your triceps
friday saturday hard
and come back on monday and do them hard
again and then wednesday and then friday
the answer is no but this need to be
sustainable but for one mesocycle and
then you turn it down and turn it off
this is just an example some notes to
generalize this
some muscles might start at a very high
frequency
and go to a crazy high frequency for
example rear delts
forearms sometimes biceps can be trained
very hard and recover just
very very quickly so they can start a
mesocycle at
three or four x per week training and
end up getting to five or six x per week
on the last mile cycle nothing wrong
with that it's per the muscle and its
ability
to recover and requirements for stimulus
there's no religion here no dogma
on the other hand just the same way some
muscles might start at 2x a week or even
1x a week
and get up to you know two to four x a
week maybe two to three bucks a week in
some
cases hamstrings are a really good
example
traps are a good example in a
well-rounded program with well-developed
traps because
all their you know all of your back work
some of your leg work
and all of your shoulder work
specifically laterals and upright rows
and things like that hit your traps
anyway
you might start with traps at zero
direct work and meso one
one time a week direct work in meso two
and two time a week direct work in meso
three
so this whole two three four idea is
just an example and a pretty decent
average
because remember a lot of the rp stuff
we say the average frequency for the
human body
for muscle groups trained per week
should be between two and four on
average
but there are for sure notable
deviations from that the other example
there is hamstrings you know
sometimes your hamstrings just only
recover so quick from anything north of
like three or four sets
like four or five sets of leg curls just
takes you two or three days to recover
from
period and two or three sets of
staphylococcus or good mornings just
take you
three to four days to recover and
there's just no way around that
so sometimes some muscles don't need a
frequency addition every mezzo
for example if you did meso two leg
curls
in the 10 to 20 range and stiff legged
deadlifts in a five to 10 range and you
want to take that into meso three and
you're like
where can i add frequency for hamstrings
the answer might be like okay you're
doing like
five sets of leg curls on your peak
workout from so2
and four sets of stuff like a deadlift
and you're just like sore in a barely
non-overlapping matter like the morning
that you have to do hamstrings again
like that last night they just healed
from last thing what the hell are you
gonna add frequency for
where also why you're gonna come in and
do two sets of some shit and then leave
that's almost like you have to spend
more time warming up during the week
than actually training
sometimes muscles take so long to heal
that even with very reasonable volumes
we're not talking about 15 sets per
session
five sets per session there's just no
more work you can squeeze in you don't
need that super high frequency i mean
ideally
the best frequencies one time a week or
zero times a week would be great if you
didn't have to train anything at all
so sometimes people get into this and
i've been in this mindset we're like
okay i'm gonna drive the frequency
right i need the frequency so i'm gonna
figure out ways to train more frequently
and you end up just
having weird shitty mostly warm up one
working set workouts
in order to drive a high frequency it's
pointless if you can get a decent
workout with just
a few sets four five six sets per
session and you can get away with two
times a week frequency holy crap
you just won the lottery that's really
awesome to that exact point
frequency needs to be modulated over the
block mesodermeso
on an as needed basis and an as
tolerated basis required
and sustainable okay i need to do more
volume because this volume isn't really
stimulating me you know clearly i can do
more
and i'm able to recover and the
sustainability is i'm able to recover my
joints and connective tissues are not
going to really ramp up and go crazy on
me in a couple weeks
if those two factors are met then yes
you can add frequency
but if one or both are not met there's
no hard rule of must add frequency every
meso no such thing at all
just begin in the lower end to your
needs at the first mesocycle
and the second meso evaluate to see if
you need to and can add frequency and go
from there
slowly step by step by step and never
ever ever
justin bieber refuted this postulate of
course by saying never say never
which he contradicted himself right in
there in that sentence by the way take
that biebs
uh almost never
have rap rapid and radical escalations
and frequency for mesodermas
don't do some shit you know people get
excited i've been there we were like man
i used to train bicep curls once a week
and i went to two times a week this last
muscle my shit blew up
six times a week bicep curl time do not
do that there's a real good recipe for
increasing injury risk substantially
so if you did two time a week biceps
last meso
and you meet the condition of it as both
sustainable for at least the next meso
and you're in need of doing it like your
biceps aren't just sore the entire time
there's no need to increase uh
your frequency then try three time a
week don't just go straight to four or
some crazy shit like that
lastly how do we treat the maintenance
phase well good news
muscle conservation which is the primary
goal of maintenance occurs at incredibly
low frequencies one time a week is more
than enough for every single muscle
group it doesn't even have to be direct
work
if you shoulder press like with a
relatively close grip for like four sets
once a week your triceps in any actual
myofibrillar content will almost
certainly not reduce
notably or at all within a month two or
three months possibly even ever
they just won't get smaller they might
lose a little glycogen lose a little
fullness within like two weeks of doing
more tricep volume for them more
frequently they're going to be as big as
they've ever been
and maybe even bigger so it's nothing to
worry about however
especially for beginners intermediates
two times per week is okay in
maintenance
because it can allow for more practice
with the movements for more strength
enhancement
and to better your technique and so on
and so forth that being said
any frequency per muscle higher than two
times a week on maintenance
is just pointlessly doing more frequency
pointlessly doing more work perhaps from
a volume basis
actually interfering with maintenance by
keeping volumes too high and if not
keeping volumes to higher
just re-irritating the joints and
connective tissues too often
leave shit the fuck alone on your
maintenance phase come in the gym for
every muscle group twice a week
do a very minimal amount of volume like
something like five sets
per session or even fewer two or three
that means yeah a maintenance face could
look like high bar squats monday
for four sets and then front squats
thursday for four sets and that's
literally all the quad volume you do
for an entire month that's awesome
because you're going to be praying and
begging and your body is going to be so
sensitive to volume
when you come back what you don't want
to do is end a maintenance phase and be
like man i train everything so often and
so hard on this maintenance phase that's
not a maintenance phase anymore yeah
sure you just maintain your muscle
because you weren't modulating your
calories
but you wasted a huge ability to drop a
ton of fatigue and really re-sensitize
for gains
once you start your next block then you
can start with
decent frequencies again instead of one
or two times a week on maintenance you
can start with two or three as needed to
provide really good hypertrophy
but remember you're sensitive to growth
and you're not optimally tailored
to high frequencies yet start a lower
end as
needed and as sustainable build into the
next meso potentially or keep the same
and as needed if needed and if
sustainable
increased frequency once again in the
third back to maintenance to drop
and so on and so forth folks i think
that's it for the face potentiation
series see you next time
for lecture 24.
