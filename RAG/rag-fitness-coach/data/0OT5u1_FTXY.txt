there is another alternative you can say
okay I'm Natty and it is what it is and
I think maybe I can gain five pounds of
muscle this year not one but five for
many people especially in years gee
three to six of your Natty career I
think the average person can gain
something like gee close to five pounds
of muscle per year a lot of people can
gain more than that but for the love of
God very many people dare I say most can
gain five pounds of muscle a year in
their year two or three to year six of
trading
