it's just completely i mean i don't even
really know what to
it's honestly one of the worst
[Music]
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today we're going to
be doing a no-nonsense
science-based review of jeff cavalier's
supplement line athlean rx
jeff's motto on youtube is putting the
science back in strength and people can
debate back and forth about
how accurate that particular claim is
but as far as supplementation goes
this is definitely not his area of
expertise so there are six individual
supplements that we're going to go over
here
and keep in mind guys that i don't just
make these videos to
randomly poop on someone for fun the
purpose here is to provide accurate
information
so that you can make the best supplement
decisions for yourself and so that
you're not wasting any of your
hard-earned money
on things that aren't actually going to
benefit you okay believe it or not i
actually make these videos in order to
help people so
even if watching somebody rip apart
athlean x doesn't interest you
this is still going to be educational in
terms of explaining various popular
supplement ingredients and dosages and
things like that so it's still something
that you're going to want to watch
all the way through all right so the
first athlean x supplement on the list
is accelerate so this is a post-workout
protein where jeff is charging
60 per bag for 22 servings so at that
price there must be
something really special about this
protein powder so let's take a closer
look
all right 30 grams of protein per
serving from a combination of whey
isolate whey concentrate and egg white
protein
so nothing at all wrong with that that's
perfectly fine assuming that the label
is accurate
i mean jeff isn't exactly known for
accurate labeling but let's give him the
benefit of the doubt here
and if he had just stopped right there
and then actually charged a reasonable
price for this then there'd be no issue
at all but instead
he goes ahead and throws in some
additional poorly thought out
ingredients let's say and he uses that
to justify charging around double the
price of what this should actually cost
so first off he adds in cree alkaline
which is supposedly an advanced form of
creatine that jeff
incorrectly claims is superior to
creatine monohydrate
in reality kree alkaline is not more
effective than creatine monohydrate in
any way
and this was shown in the research many
years ago going all the way back to
2012. creal colon supplementation does
not promote greater changes in
muscle creatine content body composition
or training adaptations
in comparison to creatine monohydrate i
honestly don't know
um any other well-known supplement
brands that still sell creaalcon
nowadays
because most people know that it's just
not necessary there's nothing wrong with
cree alkaline itself because it's
actually
98 creatine monohydrate it's just that
you don't need to be paying the
over-inflated price for it
and i think it's pretty funny how jeff
claims that his supplements are based on
quote-unquote cutting-edge nutrition
science and says that
most supplement companies never update
their formulas to reflect the latest
nutrition research
we do well you're about 10 years late on
this one jeff and
also for the record no other forms of
creatine have ever been shown in
research to be superior
to basic creatine monohydrate and so
given the fact that creatine monohydrate
is by far the most cost effective
that's the form that you should stick to
and not only that but just as a small
added side note here
because creatine is actually a
combination of three amino acids
arginine glycine and methionine and
because individual amino acids register
as protein when protein powders are
tested for
their nutrition labels because it's
based on the total nitrogen content
those two grams of creatine will
actually count as protein
and possibly as even more because
creatine can register as up to almost
150 percent protein so
not a huge deal here the difference is
going to be small but you're probably
getting something more like 27 or 28
grams of protein as opposed to 30 grams
and if you're buying a protein powder
that has
say five grams of creatine in it that
could actually be accounting for as much
as like
seven to eight grams of the protein
total so that's just something to be
aware of
because a lot of companies do this on
purpose since gram for gram the creatine
actually ends up being cheaper than
using whole food proteins so if you see
creatine listed on a protein powder
ingredient label
i would recommend that you avoid that
particular product all right after that
he adds in
betaine anhydrous which is a pretty
borderline ingredient
i would say it does have some research
showing increases in
overall training performance but as far
as i know
almost every single study showing those
benefits was sponsored by
dupont nutrition which also happens to
be the world's largest supplier of
betaine which
doesn't automatically mean that the
studies are false but when independent
studies have been done
they haven't been able to replicate
those benefits in most cases so
that's just something to keep in mind
here and also the uh
the mechanism of action between betaine
and creatine overlaps
and so even if there is a benefit to
betaine supplementation it's possible
that you're already getting that from
creatine anyway
and on top of that the proper dose for
betaine is usually two and a half grams
whereas jeff is using half of that here
now maybe that's under the assumption
that you're going to be using his other
products as well which also have betaine
in them and so combined you're going to
end up with enough
but if you're using this product alone
or one of his other products alone
then you're not going to be getting the
proper dose and then lastly for some
very bizarre reason he adds in 500
milligrams of waxy may starch
which is a carb source that bodybuilders
used way back in the day for
post-workout recovery it's like jeff is
stuck in the
early 2000s here because pretty much no
one uses or talks about waxy maze
anymore
there's no research behind it showing
any special benefit and it doesn't
matter anyway because half a gram is
virtually nothing to begin with i mean
you could take
one bite of oatmeal and end up with more
carbs than that so
this ingredient here is purely for label
decoration it really makes zero sense
whatsoever
so all in all if you're using accelerate
as a basic protein powder then that's
fine
but the price is just stupidly high for
what it actually is and the extra
ingredients that he's thrown in here
are mostly going to be useless and they
don't even remotely justify the higher
cost
the only thing this product is truly
going to accelerate is jeff cavalier's
bank account you're going to be much
better off
to just buy a regular protein powder for
around half the price
all right next up is reconstruction
which is another post-workout formula
that supposedly
speeds up muscle recovery promotes lean
muscle mass
increases quality sleep and eliminates
muscle soreness
all right so this piece of this
interesting supplement starts off with
10 grams of l-glutamine
which is another supplement that was
popular in bodybuilding circles like
10 plus years ago but it definitely
isn't as widely used nowadays and that's
because if you're consuming enough total
protein from your diet
which is very easy to do most people
will do that by default without even
really trying
in most cases assuming their meals are
based around some kind of standard
protein source
if you're doing that then you're going
to be getting all the glutamine that you
need
for muscle building and recovery
purposes and there's no need for you to
go ahead and supplement with more of it
on top of that
there are a variety of claims behind
glutamine that really just don't hold up
when you look at the actual research
it's not anti-catabolic in otherwise
healthy people
it does give a small boost in growth
hormone but it's not going to be
large enough or sustained for long
enough to have any real effect on your
body composition
it does help to replenish muscle
glycogen post workout but your regular
carb intake is already going to do that
just fine
so for bodybuilding purposes there's
just no good reason to use glutamine as
a standalone supplement
then there's six grams of l-leucine
again if you're eating enough total
protein for the day as a whole
then your leucine needs are already
going to be met and three grams is
usually all that you need for a given
feeding in order to maximize protein
synthesis so there's no need for
consuming
six grams at one time in the first place
then he's got two grams of l-carnitine
l-tartrate which
i would say is another pretty borderline
supplement it does have some research
behind it showing increases in androgen
receptor density as well as assisting
with recovery
but the research is not extensive by any
means
i think lclt is just kind of a toss-up
it might be modestly beneficial but
i don't think it's going to be anything
too significant either way after that he
sprinkles in some more betaine
and then there's two grams of l-glycine
and 200 milligrams of l-theanine
which could be helpful for promoting
relaxation and improved sleep so if
you're using this supplement
prior to bedtime those ingredients might
assist in that specific area and he does
use the proper dosages for those as well
but like the previous product the price
on reconstruction is just
completely ridiculous at 55 per bottle
okay there's no way this combination of
ingredients
justifies that cost especially
considering that uh
the ingredients that make up the
majority of the formula are mostly going
to be useless so
what really needs reconstruction here is
the formula itself and i definitely
would not recommend this particular
product
to anyone for any reason under any
circumstances
at any point in time or space if you're
finding this video helpful and you want
to see more of these supplement reviews
then make sure to hit that like button
below to let me know
and moving on we've got alpha rx which
is a bcaa product
not surprising because it's pretty clear
that jeff cavaliere is
completely out to lunch when it comes to
supplement research
or anything supplement related for that
matter i don't know how many times i
have to go over this on the channel but
bcaa supplements are essentially
worthless as long as you're consuming
enough daily protein
they're not anti-catabolic which is a
very common claim and that's because
you need the full spectrum of essential
amino acids in order to get a true
anti-catabolic effect and not just the
bcaas alone in isolation they do reduce
muscle soreness but only compared to a
placebo
and if you just eat a regular whole food
protein source post-workout then you're
probably going to get the same effect
and it's bad enough for anybody to be
selling bcaas in 2021 when
the research is clear that they aren't
going to be beneficial for the vast
majority of people
but our good friend athlete x takes it a
step further by charging an
absolutely outrageous price as well the
athlean rx bcaas give you 176 grams in
total
and for the downright disturbing price
of 50
per bottle meaning that you're paying 28
cents per gram
of bcaas most other bcaa powders are
somewhere in the range of probably eight
to ten cents per gram
and so you're paying roughly three times
the cost for this all right next up we
have is pre-workout formula
excite this is the one product from the
athlean rx supplement line that i would
say
isn't too bad so let's start with the
good okay there's six grams of
citrulline malate
uh solid ingredient for increasing
muscular performance and reducing
soreness
um we include citrulline malate in our
real science athletics pre-workout pure
form and at that same dosage he's got
1.5 grams of l-tyrosine which is an
amino acid that works
synergistically with caffeine to
increase mental alertness and reduce
fatigue
i'm also a big fan of l-tyrosine and we
also included it in pure
form but at 3 grams per serving rather
than 1.5
he's got caffeine standard ingredient in
a pre-workout and he uses 200 milligrams
which is the same dosage that we also
use so those things are good and the
dosages are fine as well
now where uh it goes downhill though is
that he includes beta alanine which is
not going to be helpful for the vast
majority of people
who are performing standard hypertrophy
workouts because it's only going to be
useful for
very high rep sets that last at least
one minute or more
which most people are not going to be
doing and even if they are the benefits
are going to be very small
and on top of that beta alanine isn't
even a pre-workout ingredient to begin
with
because it has no immediate effects okay
it's something that you take every day
and then the benefits build up slowly
over time as your muscles become
saturated with
carnosine so it doesn't make sense for
supplement companies to put beta-alanine
in pre-workouts
because people are going to need to buy
it separately anyway to take on their
off days
and not everybody likes those alanine
tingles that you get on your skin either
so
it's just something that should be
purchased separately on an as-needed
basis
depending on the person then there's
creatine hcl which
technically does saturate your muscles
with creatine at a slightly lower dose
than monohydrate
but in terms of overall effects it's not
going to be superior in any way
and even with that lower dose it still
works out to be more expensive
and like beta alanine creatine is not a
true pre-workout ingredient either
it doesn't have any immediate effects on
your strength or performance
he sprinkles in another half dose of
betaine anhydrous which is also not a
pre-workout ingredient because it has no
immediate effects
on performance either i'm not sure why
he's so gung-ho about betaine because
it seems to be in everything that he
puts together here and it's just not
that impressive of an ingredient
and also there is one gram of l-taurine
which i doubt will do anything
significant for pre-workout purposes
especially at that low dose
so overall this pre-workout is not as
bad as a lot of other pre-workouts on
the market
but it's still not something that i
would ultimately recommend and if you
want to check out pure form which was
formulated by me
using a straightforward effective
combination of research-backed
pre-workout ingredients
in their proper dosages and for a
reasonable price then you can visit real
realscienceathletics.com using the link
up here or in the description box
and you can use code youtube15 which
will take 15 off your first order
all right next up is jeff's newest
product which is an intro workout
supplement called
prx and after looking at the ingredient
breakdown i can only assume
that prx stands for pile of
rat excrement all right maybe that was
too harsh there's four grams of
citrulline malate which is a bare
minimum dose if that's all you're taking
but if you are using citrulline malate
pre-workout as well then this could give
you a small added boost
um once again he adds in cre-alkaline
for no good reason whatsoever
kre-alkalyn is nothing but overpriced
fluff and creatine itself has no
intra-workout benefits anyway
and then he's got a combination of
coenzyme q10
and nadh which is another really strange
addition
these compounds might have certain
overall health and longevity benefits
uh when they're taken continuously over
a prolonged period
but as far as intra-workout benefits go
i mean they're just not going to have
any significant
immediate effects on training
performance and he's using minimal
dosages as well
i really have no idea what the thought
process here was
aside from a potential marketing angle
there's no real
rational basis behind this formulation
for intra workout purposes i'd say you
have a better chance of adding
one inch to your arms in 22 days than
you do of getting any real benefits from
this particular supplement so that's the
review guys i don't think i need to make
some sort of extensive closing statement
here to sum up my views
um if you've made it this far then it
should be pretty obvious what i think
about the athlean rx supplement line
it's just completely i mean i don't even
really know what to
it's honestly one of the worst
