hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization quick question for you how
many calories should you be eating
who knows i sure don't end video
jk we actually have a super super simple
formula
it's barely a formula to tell you how
many calories you should be eating
because if you've ever scrolled through
the internet comments about fitness
stuff there's always about five trillion
people that are like bro how many
calories should i be eating
i i do a
kind of like a russian middle eastern
accent for those people i don't know why
that's who i grew up with and that's who
asked me real life questions about how
many calories to eat good news for
maintenance just for maintenance
just to train and look cool and just be
alive and be yourself but get the best
performance how many calories should you
have if you absolutely have no idea
here's how to figure it out so
you take your body weight in pounds
and then you multiply it by 15
and that's how many calories you should
be eating in maintenance crazy right so
if you have 200 pounds
you multiply that by 15
3 000 calories a day
that's it and video jk video is not over
that it could be over you could just log
off right now log off your internet
machine
because
that's really simple as it has to be at
first
as a pretty good guess but hold on you
certainly have problems with it but dr
mike you say right now you just said it
i heard you i'm advanced i have
way more activity than the average
person a day or way less i sleep xyz
hours and i want that to integrate
i take x y z amount of subs
or any other differences and i want to
know my maintenance well the cool thing
is that a bunch of those things are
actually handled by the renaissance diet
rp diet coach app
weird we have an app for that but if you
don't use our app how dare you not use
our app you should be embarrassed
no big deal if you don't use the app
if you want
to start at that guess of a maintenance
level how do you make sure you're
actually the maintenance that you need
and again the answer is super easy you
just have to adjust it in the following
way
three week time span is what you give
yourself at least at maintenance to
determine your maintenance calories but
you're gonna be a maintenance for a
while anyway so
three weeks should be a part of that you
take three weeks
and for the first three days
you average your first three days on
that 3000 calories whatever your
maintenance is body weight multiplied by
15
and you find out if it's trending up or
it's trending down or it's basically
like the same
if your body weight is trending up then
you're going to cut your calories by
somewhere between 0 250 to 500 because
it's a little too many calories you cut
them in goes back down
if you are
losing weight you need to increase
calories by something like 250 to 500.
now if you're much smaller than the
average sort of
listener of the stuff viewer i guess
this is all video as well um
maybe a few uh a little bit less so if
you weigh like 150 pounds to 100 pounds
or less then maybe just increase or
decrease by like 150 to 200 calories per
day okay
you're going to do that every three days
for basically three or four days for the
first week and a half so the first week
and a half you take half a week check go
up or down next half week check go up or
down now you don't have to go up up down
you can just maintain because if for
three days you're basically like
your weight is almost exactly
maintaining like plus or minus 0.2
pounds or something just leave it alone
and then the last
of that half week the last half week you
have 1.5 weeks the last third you do
that again
once you have done that
hopefully the last week and a half of
that three week period should be steady
you take that last week and a half of
that three period the first week and a
half was to fiddle with stuff just did
that
got a pretty good estimate at close to
maintenance and now
assuming that your body weight is
roughly the same if it's still going up
or down in that week and a half
on net balance you can do this again but
most of the time that last week and a
half is going to be pretty steady it's
going to fluctuate that's okay but the
average is going to be more or less
where you want it to be where you
started at first
and once you get to that average that
average number of calories in that last
week and a half of this three-week
period
is going to be probably your maintenance
or at least a very very good guess at it
and not just a guess but kind of an
empirically backed guess because you
actually tested it so again just to keep
this super simple through the period
chop it in half first week and a half
chop that into thirds
after every three or four day period you
analyze to see if you're you're at the
calories that you predicted your analyze
to see if your weight is trending
clearly up or clearly down if it's not
clearly up or down don't do anything
just keep the same calories if it's
trending up cut calories a bit if it's
turning down add some calories repeat
that three times week first week and
half is over next week and a half begins
whatever you ended with the last week
and a half stay with that
if it's nice and uh
the average is really close then that
week and a half is going to be what your
maintenance calories are for the
foreseeable future assuming you stay the
same size it's that simple
now
once you get into maintenance
there is no distinct guarantee
that your weight even though it looked
or was relatively flat on average over
the last week and a half of testing
if you're doing like let's say three
months of maintenance or
the rest of your foreseeable life at
maintenance something like that you just
want to know how many calories to eat so
you can just have a baseline and build a
good diet or even if you do that for a
few months and then you know start
cutting calories to go hypocaloric and
lose some fat or
increase calories to gain some muscle
there's no guarantee that maintenance
stays your maintenance now there's a
very good chance it's going to stay very
close but sometimes your our physical
activity changes let me give you an
example you estimated your maintenance
in the winter time and like you weren't
super active because fuck that it's cold
outside you weren't super aware of it
who knows right you still work out the
same still go to work you'll go to
school your family still respects you
you go to church good
and you had a certain level of activity
and you say 3 000 calories is great for
you during the winter you change nothing
you're still on maintenance summer
months show up
now you're in the summer and you're more
active but you're not tracking into
writing it down because like who the
fuck does that right you're going to the
beach you're throwing the frisbee to the
you guys want i throw the frisbee like
this you take the frisbee like a flat
plate surface like this and you throw it
this way that's how you actually
supposed to throw a frisbee it's not
supposed to be an easy sport this shit
right here this whatever fancy shit
that's cheating in any case you're
throwing frisbees dogs possibly to
people
and
you are just burning more calories and
you sort of don't know so what you
thought was your maintenance is now
trending your weight like this
you go shit shit here's the wrong thing
to do and think
oh
something's wrong this is my maintenance
and i'm losing weight no joke people
legitimately
comment that shit on social media like
hey
uh anyone wants to answer this question
i'm eating at maintenance and i'm still
losing weight bullshit
that is not happening not over the
course of weeks some body water shit can
happen here and there but
if you're losing weight you're not at
maintenance and your maintenance needs
to go up so at all times during what you
plan as your maintenance if over oh
about two weeks on average you're losing
weight increase the calories by a bit
maybe by like same amount 250 or 500
calories maybe a little less
if you are gaining weight you need to
cut your calories
so maintenance really is a dynamic
process
that every two weeks
at least you should be checking in to
make sure you're on
and sort of graphing your body weight
if you're super meticulous about the
shit and then it'll require possibly one
of two things an update every two weeks
to your diet just by a little bit or no
update at all because everything's good
and that's right the rest takes care of
itself
now you have a way to easily find your
maintenance
easily sort of guess and check kind of
in an empirical fashion figure out much
closer what your maintenance really is
and continuously update your maintenance
calories so they stay your maintenance
calories even though you're
it's winter again but you're hanging out
with polar bears and with g-whiz they
they get physical in their play and if
you want to stay alive you need more
calories
fuck i ended the video like that anyway
see you guys later i got nothing
you
