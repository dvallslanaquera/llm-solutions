hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
prioritization
rpu rp plus the whole thing
first video first installment
of the advanced hypertrophy concepts and
tools
lecture series the first installment is
directed adaptation let's take a look at
the contents and then we will
talk about right after that what the
purpose of this series is and i'll do
that with every single one of these
videos
so if you get to a video late you can
figure out what the purpose is after a
couple slides
and then maybe go back and watch the
earlier ones so
directed adaptation is the concept here
contents first thing we're going to talk
about what is the purpose of the lecture
series
then we're going to talk about what
directed adaptation actually is
we're going to go through four reasons
why direct adaptation exists
and uh what that means as far as
programming is going to be concerning
give a couple of examples and then do
submarine applications
so what we're doing with these videos
is we're going through the hypertrophy
book
and deriving really important concepts
that
i think really deserve a chat of their
own
not just within the context of the book
but by themselves right when when we're
writing about these concepts in the
context of a hypertrophy book
we're not so much breezing over some of
them
but we're leaving them in the context of
the flow of the hypertrophy book
we talk about a certain concept we talk
about how it works we talk about how it
feeds into the next concept
and into the next discussion and the
next the next and that's how a book
works
it's really strange to read a book that
you know you go oh this makes sense that
makes sense aha now this
and then at some point it goes like
often a big tangent and like that's nice
isn't that cool
and then comes back and goes hey by the
way here's this new concept right so
what we're doing here in these videos is
since we can't take those tangents in
the book because it would ruin the book
as far as reading ability is concerned
or
for sure reading pleasure and
comprehension here we're taking these
tangents
the best way to go about these videos is
to have a good understanding of training
theory so you probably should have
worked through all the rpu courses so
far all the basic courses for sure
um or have gotten education somewhere in
that regard
we're going to be doing very little
reference to the specific physiology
because you should already
know it because when i say motor unit in
in this uh lecture series if you don't
know what a motor unit is
you probably understand very little of
what i'm saying uh uh otherwise
what we're doing here is we're sort of
indulging in in those tangents
and not so much tangents as they are
very very very useful things to talk
about
that if we deeply understand them after
you have already a good base
understanding
once you read the hypertrophy book
you're going to be like wow this makes a
ton of sense
and you'll recognize familiar concepts
the other really good way to do this
is to wait to watch these videos and you
can watch them twice probably
watch them as they come out and then
potentially wait to watch them or watch
them again
once you've read the hypertrophy book
once you've read the entire hypertrophy
book
scientific principles of hypertrophy
training that is then
you're gonna watch these lectures and
uh some of the concepts that were not so
much brushed over but
mentioned and explained but you maybe
wanted to know more detail about them
really what they imply what their
constraints are how they would work in
another
uh potential way than they were
exemplified in the book
then this is the lecture series for you
so it's called advanced for a reason
uh it's gonna be really really high
level stuff and a lot of real real nitty
gritty
uh to make sure that we have a really
fully developed theory
of hypertrophy training at the end of
all of this
so let's get in and
talk about direct adaptation lecture
number one and there's going to be many
many more of these
so what is direct adaptation as you
probably already know it is a sub
principle of the specificity principle
of training
which there are two and it basically
says in a really
simple way that if you want to improve a
certain system the most
that it can be improved you probably
want to train that system in a similar
way for an extended period of time
that too much different kind of training
might not cause the best
directed adaptation directed towards a
specific purpose
right if the systemic improvement is
very specified
then a very specific kind of training is
probably required
over and over and over to really drive
the message of adaptation
as much home as possible and get the
best possible results
in a hypertrophy application if you want
to grow muscle in a certain area
you'll probably need to train that area
for example the biceps
in a very similar way potentially with
very similar or same exercises
probably for weeks on end in order to
get the most long-term muscle growth to
result and we'll talk about long-term
muscle growth really means a little bit
later in this discussion because
short-term and long-term muscle growth
might actually be some pretty different
processes
right of course
saying that training should be
unidirectional to some extent
automatically implies that training that
has too much variation for example
changing exercises every other session
every other week is probably not a good
idea probably not the best idea right it
could probably still work for a lot of
people
but it might be optimal to stick to
something for a little bit longer
certain set schemes certain rep scheme
certain progression uh in a certain type
of exercise selection right why is
direct adaptation a concept
it's not just something that is sort of
revealed wisdom like oh yeah direct
adaptation like that's definitely a
thing
it's uh a thing for four distinct
reasons and we're gonna go through each
one of those reasons
why direct adaptation actually results
why is it observed
that is the most effective way of
training so
reason number one is termed damage
reduction
via novelty so here's the deal
when you begin a new method of training
for example you choose a different
exercise which is a really big one
or you radically change rep ranges let's
say you're doing sets of five to ten
reps and then your
next week you do sets of 25 to 30 reps
or something like that
cadences you change from doing all
explosive reps to all eccentric
uh slow reps uh volumes you take your
volume from three sets
in a workout and you do six sets in a
workout the next workout
uh loading which is sort of inverse to
rep ranges like you're used to lifting
really light and you go super heavy
uh that brings a novelty of the stimulus
it's not a stimulus
your physiology is used to and novelty
has some predictable effects with it
one of them is that your muscular
connective tissue is just unused to the
novel stimulus
and a lot of the way that connective
tissue and muscular tissue get used to a
certain stimulus
is they develop a sort of lattice work
of connective tissue and reinforcement
to reduce the amount of damage that
muscle takes during any kind of exertion
if you're not used to a certain type of
exertion force is coming from different
angles through different exercises for
example
then your motor units that are involved
parts of the muscle that are involved in
parts of the connective tissue that are
involved
are exposed to forces through lines and
vectors that they're just not used to at
all
and that can cause a disproportionately
great amount of damage
right now the good news is is that only
happens really on the first or second
training session
and after a few training sessions these
adaptations tend to be very rapid
and the the damage amount per unit of
volume goes down
significantly so it's a good thing why
is it a good thing
if damage is really high then it's been
shown pretty clearly and theoretically
makes a lot of sense that muscle growth
actually declines
so why would this be well it turns out
that
your any individual muscle or motor unit
or even muscle cell
definitely your body as a whole has a
certain amount of
energy and resources to commit
to what we call recovery adaptations
recovery slash adaptation right
it's such a universal resource pool that
sometimes
in sports science we just use the term
ra recovery adaptation to mean almost
the same thing
because it comes from the same pool of
resources but here's the thing
if you are have a ton of resources for
adaptation you somehow stimulate
adaptation to occur
then you know you have all this resource
for adaptation
drive to occur and then adaptation
occurs to a huge extent
you get better and everything is well
however we know that
training hard doesn't just stimulate
adaptation
uh it also taxes your recovery so if you
train a little bit hard
then you can stimulate a lot of
adaptation but it costs you
some degree of recovery if you train
super duper hard it costs you more
recovery
if you train really really crazy hard it
costs you a ton of recovery
and then as the recovery demand really
goes up
as the damage levels really go up then
the amount of recovery it takes to heal
that damage
can be so high that it literally just
impinges on the amount of adaptation
resource we have left over right it's
almost like
you know if you have ten dollars and you
want to go get a sandwich across town
and you buy an uber or something like
that there's like a certain distance of
uber ride which you just spent all your
money on the uber and there's absolutely
nothing left for the sandwich
just the same way if you damage the
muscles excessively through a
really novel stimulus with a very high
volume and so on and so forth
then you're going to present a really
awesome stimulus
to adapt right theoretically right just
like if you step into an
uber and go to your favorite restaurant
10 miles away
yeah you're there you're ready to eat
but you don't have any money left over
just the same way as if you present a
huge stimulus it eats up all of your
recovery adaptive resources
you recover hopefully but you get almost
no adaptation
so this has been demonstrated to occur
in several
direct research experiments which is
really really awesome
right so when we look at novelty's
effect
specifically changing really big stimuli
like rep ranges
to a great extent huge jumps in volume
different exercises
we start to realize that if we always
introduce a ton of novelty
we always expose our bodies to a ton of
damaging stimuli
and then we're always taking that
potential adaptive resource
and really shutting it down really
eating it up
to do basically just recovery right it's
like if you really thought
damage was the end-all be-all of
hypertrophy you would just get into a
car accident once a week and holy crap
that you would get jacked
right camera guy is laughing at that so
i mean you say right you'll be like you
know holy crap you'd have huge bones and
everything
but it turns out it doesn't work like
that like if you stimulate yourself
to a large extent you get a huge
stimulus to use the adaptive resources
and
you have a lot of adaptive resources
left to use so you get your best gains
right obviously if you train barely at
all yeah you have a ton of
recovery adaptive resource to use but
like it's not being used
right that doesn't it doesn't make any
sense because like it's like taking an
uber to one mile into the 10 mile
journey to your favorite restaurant
yeah you have nine dollars left or
whatever but like there's no restaurant
around so
there's no point for that right so it's
kind of a meat halfway sort of scenario
where you want a like a robust amount of
stimulus
to cause you know some disruption so
that you get the good stimulus and have
plenty left over from recovery
adaptation to actually fuel adaptation
so if you're
always doing novelty you have usually
such high levels of damage that you're
just needlessly cutting your stimulus
short
right um an interesting analogy here
it goes like this uh you know if you
have
a city that's been exposed sort of
regularly to tornadoes
for example uh after a while you know in
the modern times usually
weeks and months and back in olden times
years and decades
the city will make structural
adaptations
to withstand tornadoes like you know if
a city regularly gets tornadoes they're
probably not going to have a lot of
houses made out of straw
a lot of the houses are going to have
basements uh things like there's going
to be a lot of reinforced steel and
concrete the stuff tornadoes really
can't knock down
uh and and so on and so forth it makes
sense because they get presented with
the same thing all the time
on the other hand imagine that you have
hit you know one year you have a crazy
tornado season
the next year out of nowhere you have
like three earthquakes but the
the adaptations for tornadoes and
earthquakes are very very different
uh and then you have a hurricane season
the next year
and oh my god what adaptations is your
is your city supposed to make who knows
right it's getting pulled in every
single direction
it's getting tons of damage every time
but after that three year process
how do we how much do we expect how good
are the adaptations to all three of
those things probably not great
and they're probably just a ton of chaos
and a ton of missed opportunity
to make improvements because the city
has to shell out so much money for all
this damage
where are they going to get money from
if they just barely recovered from
tornadoes
they started adapting to tornadoes and
then boom earthquakes so
not only did they sink a bunch of money
in tornado adaptation that was gone
if the earthquake ruined a bunch of
other stuff now they're even deeper to
the hole
they start to make some sort of
earthquake and maybe tornado adaptations
towards the second year
and then boom hurricanes and all those
basements get flooded but there's a
reason a lot of hurricane
uh prone areas don't even have basements
but if you're in a tornado from
area you need a basement right it's sort
of one or the other
right so after a while this basically
results in a whole lot of damage to the
city a whole lot of cost and not much in
the form of
reasonable adaptation at some point the
city might just be like you know we're
moving from here
everyone packs up and leaves and goes
somewhere the hell else where it's not
pure hell
as far as natural disasters you don't
want to make that similar
analogous situation for your body
shocking and new stuff is cool
when you're really really stale in your
training because it
can reinvigorate your training but you
have to start out with very little of it
and it's something you have to use uh
sort of very strategically
right if you do it all the time one big
fact is that it's going to cause a lot
of damage
through novelty and then you're not
going to cause a lot of muscle growth
all right reason number two
technique and mind muscle improvement
with the stimulus to fatigue ratio
so when you first start an exercise
or even a rep scheme or a cadence you're
probably not adapted to it fully and
you're not that good at it
for example if you start bench pressing
your bar can be wobbly and you can't
really find a good bar path yet because
you're just starting out bench pressing
which means that you're not getting the
best possible stimulus
because you spend some of your energy
pushing the pecs as hard as possible but
then they get off track
so you have to turn the pecs down or
turn them off reposition the bar
using your delts and other small muscles
and then keep pushing so every single
reps not super efficient as far as
stimulus is concerned
but because you're always trying to
adjust and go back and forth and
because you're consistently putting the
bar into positions that are
not the best for the joints like the
perfect groove is
you're actually causing more fatigue
also more psychological fatigue because
you feel like an idiot because you can't
do the exercise properly just
confusion and frustration definitely
contributes to fatigue but just
mechanically another one is squat
if you squat back too much your lower
back takes a hit if you squat
four too much your knees take a hit and
none of those is great for your quads
because if you're squatting too far
forward
your quads feel like you're not stable
there's actually the central nervous
system will decrease power
to your quads your muscle activation
will be sub-optimal
also muscle activation is usually
sub-optimal when there's any degree of
instability
the more stable an exercise the better
the muscle activation so
here's the thing if you change exercises
every single week for example
you always suck like you literally never
get used to any exercise
which is cool because you get sore and
stuff as far as that goes and we know
that if you get too sore it goes in the
negative
right so not not only is each individual
workout probably too damaging if you do
enough volume in it
to to get your best gains what also
happens is that like
you're never super super good at the
exercises and you can't
milk them out to the most that they can
be milked out how do you milk them out
well
you sequence in multiple training
sessions in a row you do mostly squats
for your leg workout this monday next
monday you do mostly squats the monday
after that you mostly squat
every single week or every other couple
sessions that you do squats
you get better at them how do you get
better at them your bar path stabilizes
so first of all you wobble less which
means you can produce higher forces
in the target muscles which means you
stimulate more muscle growth because
tension is a huge muscle growth stimulus
especially you produce forces that are
the highest with your high threshold
motor units those are the fastest twitch
motor units those are also the most
growth prone
all right so you stabilize another one
is you find
a better groove that results in two
things one
it stimulates the target muscle more
like if you bench to here you might sort
of feel my packs you bench to hear
sort of feel my pecs after a couple
sessions you start benching in the
middle and you're like oh man like i
really feel my pecs on this a lot of
tension through but that's good that's
more stimulus
right so all of a sudden you're doing
better for your muscles with that better
groove
but also uh and a good example here is
something like the squad or the deadlift
your groove is now safer and not just
safer in an acute sense safer in a
long-term sense
because it does less joint wear and tear
uh because you all of a sudden have a
really really good
perception of okay if my knees are too
far forward my knees hurt
if my knees are too far back or you know
my hips are too far back my hip and
lower back hurts
but this there's this middle there just
right that really spreads the load
evenly i can sit down on my heels and
everything feels
really really good not only can i
produce a ton of force there
into the target muscles but also i'm not
accumulating a ton of wear and tear a
ton of stress
every single time so basically your
stimulus level starts to escalate
per unit of volume as you do an exercise
longer and longer
and your fatigue starts to go down so
your stimulus to fatigue ratio which is
super important for training which will
have its own lecture on it at some point
but it will beat that to death but it's
pretty intuitive to understand for you
advanced folks
more stimulus less fatigue that's a good
thing
so if you do an exercise for the first
time you're like man oh that's this new
exercise i really felt my pecs and this
is really good but like
the technique was kind of awkward the
next time you do an exercise the
technique will almost certainly be less
awkward
you'll find that you can do a much
better job keeping the bar stable or
keeping yourself stable
you'll find that you find a track that
is
less painful to connective tissues and
joints and allows you to produce more
force
your strength will go up which means
that you'll be able to stimulate the
working muscles even better
in a very related process almost the
same process
your ability to connect mind to muscle
which has been shown to enhance
hypertrophy feeling your pecs working
during a press feeling your biceps
working during a curl feeling your quads
during leg presses for example versus
your glutes your adductors or something
else
mind muscle connection steadily improves
as you do the same
exercise over and over as a matter of
fact the first couple of sessions of
a compound movement like squats or bent
rows
a lot of times mind muscle connections
not even something you focus on you
focus just on technical proficiency like
i just want to stabilize my squat
and make sure that i'm like working the
target muscles in a safe way
that's not hurting my joints but after a
couple of sessions the mind muscle
connection starts to pick up or like
okay i have a really good technique
now i just shift my weight just a little
activate my quads just a little push my
hips just a little
wow i really feel it in my quads and the
next week you feel it even more in your
quads and if someone's like hey man
you know a couple weeks later they're
like i don't feel squats in my quads
you're like
boy oh boy if i could just give you my
brain you would trash your quads with
just a couple sets of squats because i'm
so good at activating my quads doing
that stuff that is something that comes
only with multiple exposures
you cannot maximize mind muscle
connection on a first time you just
can't
and if you find an exercise that for the
first time you ever tried it it's a
really great mind muscle connection i
promise you
the second third and fourth time you do
it it'll be an even better mind muscle
connection because that's a learned
practice skill
mind muscle connection improves the
stimulus
which is awesome so all of a sudden you
have technical proficiency improving the
stimulus reducing fatigue
and mind muscle connection improving the
stimulus it's in every one of your best
interests for hypertrophy
to continue to use the same exercise as
long as
the fatigue per unit is low and the
stimulus is really high and for
at least weeks of a mesocycle
at least four weeks very least in almost
every case
stimulus to fatigue ratio continues to
escalate
for a given movement per per repetition
for example
right and the mind muscle connection
also improves
so um it's a really really really
powerful thing
the example i have here in my notes on
the presentation is the hack hack squat
foot position my muscle example
you know the first time you use a hack
squat machine you'll put your feet sort
of where you think they belong
but you're not going to turn them
optimally and then it may be too far
forward
or too far back right or too far apart
wide or too narrow
and you know you can only play with your
stance so much during the three working
sets that you have
then you'll sort of figure out like okay
by the by the second you know by the
third working set you're like okay i
definitely screwed up when i did this
i think it's this but i'm not sure if
it's this or that the next workout you
come in
you know it's this and not this that you
play with this this
and you're like okay i think it's this
but i need to confirm it on the third
workout you confirm like okay wow this
is actually pretty good
and then on the fourth workout you work
on this and in a sixth workout
this is confirmed we could say
that your best gains on the hack squad
as far as muscle stimulus
are just now starting out in reference
to how much fatigue you're producing
on workout number six it took you six
fucking workouts
to figure out where to put your feet it
is not an arbitrary thing
i know that a lot of you have trained
for a while know that when you start a
new machine
sometimes you're like man that sucked or
like you do three or four sets
with certain grip handles and maybe has
options then you try another grip and
you're like i should have been doing
this the whole time
the hell was i doing imagine if you
altered your exercises
every single session god knows and what
are you gonna do right down in your
notebook this is exactly where i grab
the bar no you're never gonna remember
that stuff and even if you remember it
your nervous system is not gonna
remember it so what used to feel good
back then might not feel good anymore
your body changes so on and so forth
basically if you always switch exercises
you never really milk out as much
stimulus to fatigue ratio
as you can because your technique is
never really fine tuned
and your mind muscle connection is never
really fine-tuned
big downsides big downsides which we can
avoid if we don't
always alter exercises we don't alter
rep ranges like crazy we don't alter
cadences like crazy for example
just milking out a slow eccentric squat
requires some coordination and some
learning right you're like oh that was
too fast of a rep that was too slow
okay like what's my mind muscle
connection going to be like because
sometimes slow eccentrics can be powered
by various muscles
like you can sit back and do a slow
centric in a squat and like oh wow
that's a lot like loots
but if you sit forward into it you're
like wow this isn't eccentric that
really fries my quads that takes some
sessions to figure out
but if you like once one day you come in
you do regular squats
the next day you come in you do slow
eccentric squats the day after you do
power squats
gee you know you're never really
settling into milking as much as you can
at every
one thing reason number three
a bit more speculative but there's
growing evidence for this right
um the analogy here so it's preparatory
versus my fibular hypertrophy the first
analogy
just to frame your your brain around
this is that when a skyscraper gets
fixed after a hurricane
usually the fixes are not instant okay
so uh you know especially if deep
structures require upgrading for example
if you're adding floors or taking away
floors
that can take a long time just the same
way that
disaster repairs to a building are not
instant muscle growth is probably not
instant and it probably doesn't take
days to occur at a deep level that
doesn't recede days later
right in fact early muscle growth within
the first days or even
weeks might be a preparation for later
more long lasting growth sometimes it's
because of various connective
structures and connective molecules that
are installed
in the actual uh muscles themselves
a variety of different reasons and
the thing is with those early patterns
of growth
because it's what we could call
preparatory growth if you train in a
certain way you get preparatory growth
at first and your body almost from an
evolutionary perspective is like we'll
make the preparations to grow but we
don't want to grow because it's really
expensive
to you know calorically to have a bunch
of new muscle around we could do a whole
lot more with these resources
if the stimulus persists however if it
appears and reappears and reappears
the body source starts to think
analogically like ah fuck
all right we're gonna need this around
so let's lay down we already have the
prep
let's lay down the actual muscle let's
keep it around and then so when the
stimulus recedes
we know it's probably coming back
because it just keeps coming back
do you just have a couple of exposures
or one exposure to a stimulus
sort of from an evolutionary logic
perspective your body has no reason to
think it's gonna come back around
right uh like a lion attacks you once
ever like are you gonna get super jacked
because of a lion attack like
probably not it's probably only gonna
attack my line every now and again
but if you get attacked by lions every
week then your body's inclined to
think that okay whatever i need to get
more jacked and so on and so forth to
prevent
these line attacks from killing me seems
to be a regular thing so it's probably a
good idea to upgrade
that's the evolutionary logic behind how
these adaptations could have evolved but
the fact is
we're sitting here in the modern age and
we have these adaptations as
a consequence of our evolutionary past
so with pretty decent reason to believe
that
muscle growth isn't just like okay you
train you grow the cycle ends two or
three days later
and then it starts anew right over and
it's just a matter of like filling sand
into a sand pile
it's probably a lot more like building a
skyscraper you need to make drafts first
you need a scaffold first and then when
you have sufficient funding
and everything works out then you build
the floors and you connect the wires and
the electricity and so on and so forth
it doesn't just all happen at once
and it takes a while to do right so
a lot of evidence for this comes in the
following form
beginners when you train them for two
months and then you stop training them
they lose their muscle fast and they
lose it permanently
so you train a beginner for two months
or so and then you don't train them for
two months
the they don't gain muscle any faster
after that than complete beginners again
there's no memory of the fact that they
ever trained in their muscles
but if you take folks that have been
training for uh six months
a year longer and you stop training them
they can lose almost all their muscle
sometimes they don't even lose all their
muscle
a lot of it just sticks around but even
if they lose a lot of muscle
they end up being able to regain muscle
really rapidly after they start because
some of those preparatory fixtures may
never go away
or they're still laid down they're
slowly going away but not immediately
so here's the thing if you stimulate
certain motor units
via training one way over and over and
over
the preparatory growth phase leads to
what we call the myofibrillar growth
phase where actual fully functioning
muscles are installed
but if you always change the pattern
then you say you stimulate some motor
units here
this week they lay down preparatory
structures next week you do a different
incline
variant or something like that different
fibers get hit
to their limits and they're no longer
the same fibers and the fibers that were
initially targeted and stimulated and
laid down preparatory methods
kind of waiting around like well i guess
there's nothing happening and they start
to take the preparatory stuff and
and basically break it down and then the
next time they're stimulated let's say
two weeks later
it's like they never have been trained
before so you don't actually keep any of
the gains but if you stimulate stimulus
stimulate
two or three times in a row there may be
a degree of adaptation that never really
recedes or recedes very slowly
because now that there's been multiple
exposures your muscles in a sense have
all the preparation laid down and then
they lay down the more final structures
those probably don't just go away right
not easily
in any case lastly on a very related
note i was debating whether or not to
make this three points or four
is a special case of preparatory
myofibular hypertrophy it is
myonuclear domain expansion very well
documented
and is a special form of long-term
hypertrophy here's how it works
my nuclear domain is a cell nucleus the
control center of the cell
and all of the area of sorry the volume
of a muscle cell
that it controls around it right just
like uh
you know a city government can only
control a city that's of a certain size
and like the further you get away from
city government the more people don't
pay attention to specific laws because
no there's nobody's going to come out
there and force them
think about if you live in the middle of
nowhere in arizona
and there's a county sheriff right the
county sheriff their my nuclear domain
volume or area in this case is that
entire county
how good are they about responding in a
timely manner to various needs in the
county like hey like
my dog's missing or my dog climbed up a
tree to try to eat my cat
like when can you get here sheriff and
he's like i don't know like an hour and
a half because it takes forever to drive
across this giant-ass county
yeah you know not the most effective
government potentially
or imagine a really giant corporation
like uh you know
rp's not that big of a corporation for
me to get approval to work on a project
i called nick shaw
in five minutes he says great and i
start the project if i was working for
general motors general electric
att amazon how many pieces of a problem
long would it take for me to get
approval on something oh my god
months years sometimes you got to talk
to 50 other
people and everyone has to sign off of
this huge chain of command
just the same way a nucleus in a muscle
cell literally
uh sort of is in charge of maintaining
and keeping up and improving
its uh cellular volume around it
the further out you go the longer it
takes for the nucleus to ship
certain molecules or get information
about certain structural deficiencies
and at a certain domain volume a certain
distance away from the nucleus in all
directions
it's too slow and so for example if you
have a muscle tear
and you're born with some kind of
genetics where my nuclear domain
ceiling's just not installed right
so all normal human muscles have an
understanding of how much is too much
let's say you don't have one
your muscles get so big that the outer
rims of them are so far from the nucleus
that the muscular proteins start they
just naturally degrade anyway from just
contraction
the time it takes to heal them becomes
crazy
right two weeks after a training session
you're still
damaged what's that gonna that's gonna
result in injury right just
in degradation all kinds of really weird
stuff you have a creatine kinase
of crazy crazy levels because there's
parts of your muscle membrane broken and
leaking ions everywhere in your blood
slowly killing you and destroying your
kidneys and
there's nothing you can do about it
because your nucleus is like oh my god
eons in this tiny little nucleus can't
control all the stuff around it right
so the good news is that doesn't almost
ever happen in the human body
because once so when you start training
in the beginner stages of training the
first several weeks or months of
training
any particular area of the body what
ends up happening is
there's a nucleus and the nucleus says
hey grow grow grow and it helps control
the stuff and growth occurs around it
when your myonuclear domain ceiling is
hit the nucleus basically the muscle
cell figures out like yeah you know what
this nucleus can no longer control and
and help any more of the cell we need
more nuclei to come in to the outside of
the cell
take over and have their own areas of
expansion that's basically like
you know as the united states was being
discovered in various parts of it were
being populated
it's not like new york city started out
over here and then 500 miles out is all
new york city no like there's different
say newark and are there various parts
of new jersey nobody cares about
just kidding new jersey love you guys
right philadelphia whatever
all different cities are born so they
can control their own little governance
areas so that one central controller
doesn't have anything to do
how many people in the united states you
know um does
washington dc control everything only in
a very general sense
rightly does washington dc control the
exact speed limits in kansas city no
kansas
city is is controlling that and as the
united states expanded out and expanded
you know within itself to more and more
population density suburbs expand
and they get their own names to get
their own little government same as new
nuclei
so the question is as your muscle cells
grow where the heck do these nuclei come
from well it turns out they're
what are called satellite cells which
are like sort of dormant cells
they're muscle cells but they're mostly
nuclei with very few myofibrils very few
actual contractile elements around them
sometimes none
they just sit there on the outside and
within the muscle cell or in between
muscle cells
and this don't do a whole lot of
anything at some point when myonuclear
domain ceilings
start to be reached these limits start
to get reached
some sort of signaling process which is
still a little bit mysterious to us
uh tells these satellite cells to donate
their nuclei into the existing cells
that have
a whole bunch of contractile elements
that actually help you do work
the nuclei are donated satellite cell is
no more
its nucleus sort of fuses the cell into
this other cell
and now there's another nucleus so maybe
you had only you know this much muscle
that you can control
with one nucleus you get this other
nucleus now you have pretty much double
the muscle that you can control which is
really really awesome
here's the thing if you train
only enough to expand your myonuclear
sorry to expand the muscle cell
to less than its myonuclear domain it's
been shown
that if you lose that muscle by training
another way or stopping training it goes
away almost completely and there's
almost no memory of it whatsoever
and regrowing it takes damn near as much
time as it took to grow it the first
time
however if you grow a muscle enough to
where it's my nuclear domain ceiling is
reached
and other nuclei come in to help out
once they get integrated it seems like
they either
rarely leave or never leave for the rest
of the lifetime of the muscle
so what ends up happening is that these
nuclei
float in they expand the domains around
them
and now you have this larger muscle that
when it shrinks if you train it
differently
or you train it barely at all it shrinks
only to a fraction
of the size which shrunk otherwise right
sorry larger fraction of that size
and if you come back to retrain it in a
different way it makes incredibly fast
gains
because there's tons of nuclei to power
those gains as opposed to just
one right so it regains muscle size like
crazy and this is super super well
documented right
here's the deal if you stick to one
method of training
that trains certain motor units really
hard for weeks and weeks and weeks
those motor units grow so much the
muscle cells they control grow so much
that they're like ah crap my nuclear
domain they reach it
and they have to import other nuclei
from satellite cells and then they
expand expand expand
every time they import more nuclei you
get a sort of hammering in of more
more permanent adaptations because
there's a certain level of size that
muscle will never go back down to
and it regains muscle super quick if you
start training it that way again
so for example if you do leg presses for
like eight weeks
those muscle fibers that are responsible
for the leg press in a particular
fashion that you put your feet and quad
activation
they're more likely to absorb more
myonuclei
and thus get that more temp more
permanent growth
once you go to hack squats after eight
weeks yeah some of those
muscle fibers are no longer getting hit
is hard no longer challenge they'll
shrink a little bit
but not much and they have that memory
of how they used to be back in the day
when at peak leg press
you train the other muscle fibers more
with hack squatting so they get bigger
when you go back to leg pressing again
after eight weeks
then you regain the size within like the
first week or two
leg press specific size and then it's
all six weeks of completely novel gains
but if you do hack squat one week leg
press another half to what one of the
leg press another you can kind of do
kind of this kind of that kind of this
kind of that and you may not go nearly
as far now of course
on average you'll still gain muscle and
hit my nuclear domains and
you will incorporate cells or myonuclei
and it will grow
but it's probably better to do real
distinct runs at a specific
set of motor units which you do through
various exercise selections or rep
ranges
and then once that occurs you cool it go
to some other combination of exercises
but you've got a much more permanent
approach here
another really quick analogy on a neural
level
is learning language like if you do a
week of french in a week of spanish in a
week of russian in a week of german
you probably learned absolutely nothing
by the end of the month this is way too
confusing there's no solidification that
occurs
you think jesus christ i studied
languages for four weeks
i should know something you learn like
hola and spanish and
you know something you thought in german
it turns out it's not a word
right however if you take three months
of each language in succession
right then what you end up doing is by
the end of your three months of french
like you legit straight up know some
french
and for those of you who have learned
other languages you know how this works
you learn some bit of a language
you never forget especially as you're a
child but even as an adult
if you learn to a certain level it just
doesn't ever go away
or if it goes away when you start
speaking french again you're like
whoa it just goes back up really fast we
want to get to that sort of
semi-permanence in our muscle growth
which is why hammering away at the
similar similar similar similar direct
adaptation is a good idea
too much variation takes away from that
so that's reason number four
all right yahoo lots of stuff that was
super awesome
those are our four big reasons direct
adaptation works what are the
programming recommendations that we can
build based off of those
so you want to choose at the beginning
of a muscle growth program
a certain set of exercises with
relatively low volumes
and low relative intensities you don't
want to push it super hard because
remember novelty is taking care of a lot
of your growth for you if you push it
super hard you just get a ton of damage
so
start easy every week you want to
increase the
load to some extent and probably the
volume on each exercise as needed
more on that in a later lecture we'll
talk about exactly how and we'll talk
about
we're going to develop algorithms for
how to decide how much to increase by
don't worry about all those are solved
problems
but we're going to keep the stimulus
nice and strong which is going to
require more more more notice that's
still directed adaptation it's not
like that you don't do three sets one
week and then 18 sets the next that
would make no damn sense right
of course we can't do that forever with
the same exercises staleness is a thing
so once performance improvement on an
exercise stalls out and even falls off a
little bit for
probably an entire mesocycle just so
we're sure
or connective tissues and muscles and
joints
start to have pain in them and pain
probably indicative of a
micro injury then we know that there's
like a little bit too much cumulative
fatigue
we need to switch the way we're training
like you've done so many leg presses
that your knees hurt
and when you try half squats turns out
your knees don't hurt because there's
different lines of force
okay well why the hell am i still doing
blood presses good idea you shouldn't be
right
then you can switch to an exercise when
you're not getting really good gains
and or when a little mini injuries are
adding up we're going to have an exact
algorithm as to how to figure that out
later so don't worry about that we'll
get to that in a future lecture
but basically that's the gist of the
process so what we're really saying is
like
as long as we're getting gains from an
exercise and as long as we're not
injured for that exercise
more often than not we're just going to
default to keeping it
because of the so many benefits of
keeping a certain exercise
certain rep range so on and so forth and
if we're moving through sets
and we're moving through weight we're
doing it very slowly very meticulously
right this means that some exercises
will be used for a year or more straight
like you ask yourself should i still be
high bar squatting the answer is your
gains are great they're super consistent
your mind muscle connection's awesome
stimulus to fatigue ratio is awesome and
you don't have any
joint aches or pains why would you stop
why would you stop
there's no good reason to stop keep
going right so you could do that from a
year or more straight and and some
exercises maybe from one to three months
uh sometimes you have to switch for
various reasons it's an exercise that
causes a little you know
too much wear and tear or it quickly
becomes really stale
usually that's at least a mesocycle of
one to three months
there's very very few cases outside of
like well this exercise is just gonna
get me hurt if i keep doing it it just
doesn't work for my body which is
possible
outside of that case you really
shouldn't be switching exercises any
more often than one method cycle which
is usually one to three months of
duration so accumulate slowly
deload and then maybe you change
exercises not for sure
but there's almost no situation in which
like monday you'll do
incline bench next monday you'll do flat
bench then decline after that
that would make very little sense
there's scarcely a place for
weekly exercise rotation in most
training
so a couple common examples and this
will be on your screen for you to read
if you want to pause the video and read
these more slowly can basically
take a relative beginner let's say you
begin squatting roughly 100 pounds for
three sets of about 10 reps right
slowly over the weeks over the months
you work up to squatting 160 pounds for
eight sets of 10 reps which is way more
but we got there with really really
gradual elevations right
still the same exercise by the way and
that takes let's say six months
right and now your knees feel a little
bit funky and squat gains are really
slow and maybe non-existent
so you switch to close stance smith
machine squats which are quite a
different exercise
and then you start with three sets of 10
or so at 120 pounds it just happens to
challenge you with that
number of sets and reps and you begin to
climb again you maybe
end those at 160 because they're more
challenging exercise
four to six months later and then you
could go back to squats six months after
that
and then start at like 140 and go all
the way up to 180
sound like how gains are made right
small steps
through cycles and cycles and cycles
never making huge changes
but slowly making changes as needed
right and the other example here
and this is to illustrate a specific
point you start doing uh
assisted dips right somebody tells you
hey dips are really good for triceps
you're like god makes sense
biomechanically i'm going to try them
you do the assisted dips because you're
maybe not strong enough to do bodyweight
dips yet for any kind of meaningful reps
and they feel super awkward here's the
take home from this example
don't quit don't quit right a lot of
people are like oh that feels weird i'm
going to be done you know all exercise
kind of feels weird when you first start
remember
back when you first did any kind of
squatting or anything you're like this
is awful i want to die
right and now you think squats are great
so give it a chance right
week after week your mind muscle
connection will probably improve with
those assisted dips
your technique is going to stabilize and
feel really familiar
that you know week two you came in and
you're like oh god these things again
week five you're like ah i know exactly
what you're doing and where to put my
hands you know how to arch my chest
everything's super good to go and after
um a mesocycle you'll probably be
really getting stronger and the exercise
will feel super great you're like wow
i'm torching my triceps and someone's
like what about your elbows you're like
they feel
fine they feel a little weird the first
couple weeks before i got the hint on
the technique but now they feel super
great after four mesocycles of these
dips you know your gains on them
probably halt and
you know you could be switching at that
point to close grip bench presses right
which again will feel strange but
that's okay because there's a momentum
that results
from doing similar things over and over
and getting a little bit better at them
over time which is really kind of almost
the morality of hypertrophy gains
is if you're willing to do similar
things over a long time and just eek out
little tiny improvements
that's the best way to set yourself up
for the most awesome things possible
which is of course being
the most jacked person alive or even the
most jacked person dead
i'll take that title so summary
implications here
it can be tempting to use novelty for
its own sake
different sometimes feels cool often
feels cool
and it helps sort of that you know you
get sore if you do different exercises
every single session you get sore every
time
which can be mistaken for like that's a
good thing uh put it this way if you're
never getting sore you might not be
training as hard as you could be
but if you're always super duper sore
you're probably just damaging a whole
lot where you could be growing much more
so there's a balance there that you have
to strike there's probably such a thing
as too sore and
training differently all the time all
the time all the time
one of two things will happen you'll
either be way too sore all the time if
you use appropriate volumes to get the
best growth
or you'll have to use such tiny volumes
to not get sore that you might not be
ever training with enough volume to
cause a whole lot of growth you're just
sort of
altering things for their own sake if we
want maximum hypertrophy
we have to do the right things not the
tempting things so you want to focus on
improving your technique and mind muscle
connection with
similar exercises slowly get stronger
slowly add volume and of course at some
point you're going to be much stronger
doing much more volume the exercise will
become stale or a little bit more
injurious
then you can switch out the exercises as
needed to build the best
long-term muscle that you can i hope
that made as much sense coming out of my
mouth as i did in my head
folks see you next time for lecture
number two
which i think let me see if i can bring
out my handy-dandy lecture guide here
is going to be about training modality
