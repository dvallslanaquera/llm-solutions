[Music]
oh my god that was brilliant
[Music]
hey folks
i'm dr mike
this is rob elworth we met at a local
gym here in michigan and the meeting
went something like this i was like
sucked bro and he was
fucking looking at and i was like
nothing i'm just your pecs look great
you said you want to do something about
it so five hours later we walk out of
the sauna and now we're best friends
absolutely so to speak
and uh rob's here at renaissance gym and
he is going to be training chest delts
and biceps
fun
you ready oh yeah do it let's do it
[Music]
chest exercise number one is the incline
dumbbell press sets of 10 to 20 reps
here always full range of motion big
pause at the bottom of the super stretch
let's get after it we're gonna do like
probably like five sets of the stuff and
then we're gonna move on to another
chest exercise and then an exercise for
delts exercise for biceps here's the
thing you don't need to do a trillion
exercises for every single muscle group
like one to two usually suffices two
properly done
sets close to failure with a full range
of motion nine times out of ten will
mess you up so bad you don't have to do
18 exercises but uh you could if you
want to train wrong anyway let's get it
done
14 keep it going
[Music]
15 excellent slow chest up
16
slow chest up pause
up
17 couple more almost there
18. control chest up pause
19 one more what do you say slow
chest up pause
up
up
push them in push them in push them in
yeah slow as if you're going to do
another as if you're going to do another
big chest lift that chest lift that
chest
rack
exactly 20. felt good yeah great it
looked great yeah no major critiques
seven slow
chest
yeah
eight
one to two more
good last one
slow chest up
up and in go
and then slow as if you're going to do
another
chest up just up chest up pause
rack
oh shit jk
did you want to do another one no if if
i ever
as long as your technique is going to be
good if i ever say one more and you got
two more fucking do it that last
technique probably would have been the
greatest thing sure sure
a survival rep i don't want to slow you
slowly oh my god yeah no we're here for
you man fuck fuck that well we'll like
if if i know you're sandbagging i'll let
you know when to start
scott can we can we take a look at rob's
uh shaker here
so folks
you must drink
fucking what is that lighter fluid
cement
industrial uh lubricant with everything
but a bit of a bit of everything you
want to be a fucking machine you gotta
you gotta do machine shit
you know literally
god we're gonna kill some 13 year old
kid who's gonna drink fucking
automotive lubricant for some reason
just up
oh yeah
oh my god rep of the century amazing one
so one thing you guys will notice is
when rob has done his last concentric
phase of his repetition i mean typically
it's easier to just dump after that and
that's totally fine but a cool thing you
can try in your training is when you
finish the last concentric rep of
something milk the eccentric as if
you're going to do another one hold the
bottom position for a second and then
dump it just gets you one more eccentric
rep and eccentrics are probably a little
bit more growth promoting than
concentrics just by a tad and like we
might as well get that shit you know and
you already fucking work to move the
dumbbells up there and you're super
close to failure and we know the fibers
taken very close to failure probably
experience a little bit more growth than
fibers contracting any other time so
it's kind of like we get the eccentric
it's already close to failure we already
did the work to get up there might as
well milk that shit out now the downside
is it's fucking hard as hell so fuck
that you know what i'm saying i'm trying
to i can smoke a cigarette as soon as
i'm done with a rap some dump that shit
throw it on grandma's foot or some shit
next to me yeah that's the upsides but
the downside is you probably grow a
little bit less but we did all the work
might as well finish off strong your
technique is getting better every single
set
four let's get at least six
chest
five
[Music]
one more
can't stop
[Music]
one more you got this you got this you
got this long pause big chest
up
yes
slow on the way down as if you're gonna
do another
[Music]
beautiful
beautiful okay back over there oh no i
got it you're a guest
world record that left
five sets of dumbbell presses done
rob's pretty fatigued chest is pretty
pumped
now we do deficit push-ups
the old deficit push-up setup
deficit push-ups rob's a strong dude if
we did these first he'd get like sets of
30 or 40 reps in the first set but now
that he's pre-fatigued this is an
excellent super deep stretch of an
exercise we're going to be doing
phenomenally strict technique
a lot of people think push-ups really
but i'm jack they need a bench press
watch the shit
12
no rest at the bottom
yeah
13.
pause with no weight unloading up
14.
[Music]
15.
full lockouts
[Music]
16. there you go
17
[Music]
18 keep it going slow
19. lock it one last one
chest up there you go
oh fuck yeah beautiful that's it that's
it good stuff
feels good excellent
question how long to rest between sets
uh when we were warming up with rob he
asked and
people have their preferences but i
think going back to the basics of
physiology is probably good to answer
that question it's like
what do we really need for that next set
to be like and the answer is we need
that next set to be stimulative we need
our bodies to be ready to produce lots
of force and to be recovered so the real
question is how long should i rest gets
replaced with
how long does it take me to recover and
then we need a couple of points of what
recovery means generally speaking it
means
do you feel strong again because if
you're super winded or super just feel
weak right after set don't go yet rest
longer is your cardio back like if
you're breathing
super heavy you're not gonna have a
productive neck set remember we're not
here to train our lungs we're here to
train our muscles so we need the muscles
to be the limiting factor
are there any other muscles that you're
using that are still messed up so for
example if you're doing barbell rows and
your forearms are still tired but your
back is ready you need to relax until
your forearms are ready because
otherwise they'll be the limiting factor
and then lastly
enough rest for the local muscle to be
able to do at least five repetitions
that's like a bare minimum which means
that it really depends on the exercise
on the muscle
which rest time you choose so for like
forearm wrist curls or something
youtube uh you know you might be doing
like 10 second breaks and all those
factors get checked off the list with
something like squats for sets of 10
fuck you might be like 10 minutes
between sets and that's not a big deal
so as soon as you feel fundamentally
ready to go again feel free to go can
you rest longer than that yes is there
benefit to that maybe but probably super
marginal benefit you don't want to waste
too much time the gym so pretty much
when you're ready to go it's time to go
10.
hang in there do your best
11.
[Music]
oh beautiful one more fuck
let's do it let's do it let's do it i
saw you setting it up
go
up up up up up up up yes yes
oh my god that was brilliant
if i was a gambling man i don't know if
i'd bet that you got that last one you
fucking did it
good shit man good shit oh it feels good
though awesome awesome awesome
i like the stretch at the bottom yeah
it's the thing is like there's more and
more research coming out now that that
stretch under load actually grows more
muscle than if you skip the stretch so
any time you can get a stretch with any
muscle group it's probably worth it all
right so we're going to failure
and then going to knees
all sort of failing blowing it out again
like five second break between the two
okay
[Music]
five
six
[Music]
seven
[Music]
eight
slow
nine one more let's make it happen

three fuck yeah keep going
four
[Music]
five
look forward
up
six go that's it
oh good shit man
how'd that feel good felt real good
excellent
i thought that on the needs was gonna be
easy you start doing it's not easy i
don't have a chest anymore
good stuff get a drink of water collect
yourself and we'll start warming up your
shoulders
pecks are finished 10 total sets of
chest
now we move on to shoulders
five sets
but it's super sets
lateral raises just above parallel with
one second pause slow slowly centric
just like that and as soon as rob's done
he's gonna throw those hopefully into
somebody's face turn around and do cable
upright rows
pause at the top slow descent just like
that back to back then rest to fully
recover and do it again that's just one
set we're doing five of them shits
rob's got big shoulders already but this
pump is gonna be fucking gnarly let's do
it
beautiful keep going
full stop
good two more and we're done
full stop good
one more
oh
brutal
that's it that's it that's it that's it

let's get about 10 here full pause at
the top if you don't pause we won't
count it one
fucking stop it up there
five
six let's get it to stop come on you got
this
that good good good one more let's last
one here stop it stop it
down
this catches up real quick
good shit man good stuff
upright rows we do them are they bad for
you
no
they're not bad for you
there is a certain chance that you will
develop some sort of shoulder
impingement from doing any shoulder
exercise in which your arm travels up
like this way and no exercise is safe
you can even point your pinkies down and
do it like this the vast majority of
people be safe it feels weird it feels
painful modifier technique or stop doing
it the idea that upright rows surely
cause some sort of shoulder dysfunction
is not in evidence and most of the
people that say it are people like that
athlete x guy who as far as i can tell
don't even lift
three
[Music]
four rest
go
five
last one rest
last one go hold hold hold down

last exercise for the day we got some
biceps we are gonna do something that we
actually haven't done on the channel in
a while maybe since bree and joe
we will be doing a cable bicep curl drop
set which means we start with left wow
something like a 15 to 20 rep such sort
of situation and then we go down 10
pounds for about five or six sets
basically no rest five seconds three to
five seconds rest brutal time saving
brutal did i mention brutal let's get it
done you're dropped the weight and then
we're pausing doing another one that's
