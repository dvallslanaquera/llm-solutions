hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today we're going to talk about a super
advanced concept we're going to talk
about really really nerd style
pre-exhaust training in the pursuit of
hypertrophy so
a couple of things we're going to talk
about what pre-exhaust training actually
is
define it very clearly we're going to
talk about the mechanisms of pre-exhaust
training
the limitations of pre-exhaust training
it has quite a few
which means it's not the greatest thing
ever and finally the applications of
pre-exhaust
where it really can be used to its best
effects
so pre-exhaust fundamentally what is it
it is
when you fatigue an isolated muscle
before performing a compound movement
that involves that isolated muscle as
well it can be done superset style which
is back to back to back
or it can be done with straight sets for
example
superset style you can do a skull
crusher super set to close grip bench
right away
or you can do a straight arm lap pull
superset to a regular lat pull
okay that pre-exhausts the lats in that
case
and then you can also do it just as far
as constructing your program with
separate exercises so
you can do leg presses for four sets
normal rest and then squats for four
sets normal rest
the leg presses pre-exhaust your quads
and then the squats because they involve
quads and glutes and lower back and all
this other stuff that quads may be more
hit in that exercise more of a limiting
factor so on and so forth because
they're pre-exhausted
another one easy one is you do bicep
curls for five sets
and then you do underhand pull downs for
three sets and like
you know the bicep is definitely
pre-exhausted in the underhand pull-down
more than it would usually be and
maybe that'll create some different
outcomes okay
so what are the mechanisms of
pre-exhaust how does this actually work
the mechanism and why pre-exhaust can
work well
is that muscles grow the most relatively
speaking
all other things being equal when
they're taken closer to failure
and they don't grow super well if
they're taken really far away from
failure and then the set stops
how does this happen first of all the
closer failure you get on average the
more high-end
large growth-prone motor units parts of
the muscle
you end up recruiting turning on they
generate tension they get growth
so if you stop really far short of
failure especially with higher reps and
the big nasty motor units don't really
ever turn on a whole lot
they don't through put a lot of tension
and they don't get a lot of hypertrophy
so close to failure does that better
as you go closer to failure you summate
more and more metabolites like more of
the burn lactic acid so on and so forth
those independently cause muscle growth
and you get way bigger pumps going
closer to failure and of course pumps
via cell swelling effect have been
demonstrated
to cause muscle growth independently all
right so we get
more tension through the faster twitch
motor units
potentially potentially we get more
metabolites emission and more pump
if we get a muscle closer to failure and
pre-exhaust
can take a muscle closer to failure
right how
well if you start a compound let's say
we're doing dumbbell press we'll use
that example for a while
dumbbell bench press is a compound
movement that involves primarily let's
say the pecs a little bit of front dots
we'll skip that
pecs and triceps let's say mostly okay
if you start out the dumbbell press
with pre-exhausted triceps okay
those triceps are already closer to
failure
and even if you pre-exhausted them an
exercise ago and especially if it was
just a movement to go a few seconds ago
you finished let's say dumbbell skull
crushers
and you go right into dumbbell presses
those
triceps are really much closer to
failure than the pecs
and there's only so many presses you're
going to be able to do until they fail
or close and you have to put it down
so at the end of the day your pecs maybe
went to like
seven reps in reserves you could have
done just by themselves squeezed out
seven more good reps before they got
tired but your triceps went to one or
zero reps in reserve that means for
those two muscle groups that normally
grow
pretty equivalently within an exercise
one of them
got way closer to failure than the other
and almost by definition got
the better side of the workout they got
fractionally
more muscle growth stimulus out of that
set right
this is especially true if
the compound we're using the pre-fatigue
muscle becomes the limiting factor
because then it gives out first and it
literally caps
the set for the non-limiting factors
like if your triceps are out and done
your pecs could have had like seven more
reps but they stopped
all right so that it's a very high reps
and reserve set for the pecs not
impressive growth
very low reps and reserve set for the
triceps which is
awesome and it allows you to get a huge
benefit and then again if you just did
skull crushers for triceps with
dumbbells
you get close to failure great set for
them but the set is over you rest then
you have to do it again
maybe you don't have to hand the set you
transition to presses and because
there's a mechanical advantage
essentially your pecs help to the extent
that they can continue to push the
triceps
sort of beyond failure keep them in that
close to failure low rir
zone where there's tons of pump tons of
metabolites and the faster twitch motor
units are still like ah
why hell are we still on they still get
tension throughput through them
and then they generate more hypertrophy
versus just stopping
right so potentially that's how
pre-exhaust can actually help growing
muscle
now the pre-exhausting exercise
should have some characteristics that
make it better for this job
and the compound exercise after should
also have some characteristics
that make it ideal or less than ideal so
let's talk about
the pre-exhausting exercise what should
it ideally look like
first of all a pre-exhausting exercise
should do a good job pre-exhausting the
target muscle
and not just a bunch of muscles so the
target muscle should be the limiting
factor by
far because it's the muscle that's going
to get hit everything else doesn't
really get hit
so isolations really are number one here
skull crushers
leg presses bicep curls etc you don't
pre-exhaust by saying like i'm doing
underhand pull-ups first
and then overhead pull-ups well like
underhand pull-ups yeah they do use the
biceps a lot but that's not exactly like
by far the limiting factor like your
lats are pretty even if your biceps give
up first
your lats are a couple reps away from
giving out too so you want something
that
really is an isolation exercise where
the target muscle
is really by far the limiting factor
okay
secondly faster twitch motor units
fatigue bad not only do they fatigue
within a set
they fatigue set to set and for sure
exercise to exercise
you don't want to shit away faster motor
unit stimulus
by saying okay we're going to stimulate
decently make the faster units tired by
mostly stimulating the slower units
and then do a real faster motor unit
stimulation exercise after
because by then even that faster motor
unit stimulating compound hardcore and
heavy
you're so fucking tired your motor units
are so tired
from the first exercise that didn't do
that great of a job stimulating them
just kind of tired them
out it's not doing any great work for
you
it's kind of like a sort of analogy is
like taking a really long
jog before squatting heavy your shit is
just tired
there's no pre-exhaust it's just exhaust
so
that first exercise should be as high in
what's called raw stimulus magnitude as
possible
it should be as hardcore as possible so
that you're not just
sort of warming up the area and getting
some blood going in it you're doing a
real good job stimulating gains
in their own right to really fatigue the
living shit
out of the faster twitch motor units to
get them and the slower which ones
really pre-exhausted in the real way so
that the second exercise the compound
one
has a lot to work with like there's been
a lot of food prep done in the kitchen
beforehand
not just like you have a bunch of raw
eggs you know right cook right so here's
the deal
what does that mean that means if you
have a choice and uh coach cassim and i
debated this on steve hall's podcast and
we
agreed to this point a great debate if
you want to look that up uh pre-exhaust
versus myself and
uh kasim hansen on uh revive stronger
leg pressing and then go into squats is
better than leg extensions and then
going to squats why
because leg extensions are not an
exercise you start a training
program with because they don't tend to
let you recruit super high force motor
units
right and then they just tire you out
which is cool for the slower twitch
intermediate twitch units but probably
for the faster
smaller units not that great like leg
press or like extensions are cool to
finish off a training session for quads
with mason drop sets or something like
that
but you want to start with something
yeah isolationy
but nonetheless hardcore right skull
crusher is better than some kind of rope
extension save those for later leg
presses
better than uh leg extension so on and
so forth so yes
isolate pretty exhaust but make sure
that you still
really really do a good job
independently training
that muscle group with whatever you pick
first and it's not just some kind of
sort of pussy footing exercise now
limiting factor setup okay
is the best okay because you want that
muscle that pre-exhaust muscle in that
second movement the compound movement
after
to be as much of a limiting factor as
possible this lets it get hit the
harvest
and it prevents the other muscles in
that compound from getting hit a ton
because that's not the point of the
exercise the point of the exercise
is to make that compound after another
isolation movement essentially
for that muscle that you're targeting
here's the best way to select that
compound
okay first the pre-exhausted muscle
should already bio-mechanically be a
major contributor to the compound okay
so if you do skull crushers and then go
to close grip bench that kind of makes
sense because
even in close qr bench by itself the
triceps work pretty hard but
if you do skull crushers to wide grip
bench or regular bench like
okay yeah your triceps are pre-exhausted
but instead really try some exercise
it's a peck exercise with kind of tired
triceps
so it doesn't exactly stimulate your
triceps a ton and keep them super close
to the limits
you know in that second exercise so you
know even that second compound
should be a compound that is more
tailored towards hitting up
the actual stimulated targeted muscle
from the first isolation that you're
doing
all right second ideally okay and this
isn't
either or it's a spectrum other muscles
that are involved in that compound
should be poorly leveraged to make up
force deficit
at a certain range of motion for that
compound which means
your isolation gets real close to
failure because it's really the only
thing that can make the big difference
for example
in a traditional bench press okay
especially wide grip
your pecs alone by moving your humerus
inward
can do a lot of the locking out even if
your triceps are tired
however in an overhead press with a
barbell
when you're up here your front delts are
incredibly poorly leveraged
to lock out you guys are probably been
here before with chad triceps where
you're here
and there's no amount of front delt
anything you can do to lock out you
physically have to use your triceps and
you can tell so picking exercises as a
second compound that
really have nasty sticking points for
that
isolated muscle before really good ideas
overhead press
so if you do like some skull crushers
instead of going
and doing medium grip bench even instead
of close grip bench try some skull
crushers
and then get the bar or something like
that or dumbbells and do overhead
presses holy crap you will for sure
every single set you fail will fail
because of your triceps it won't be like
oh my shoulders it'll just be like my
elbows won't move anymore
really really good idea last
recommendation
and these this is not either or it can
be like a summated list where you can
get all these or some of them
two degrees of freedom or more in the
joints is ideal for that compound which
means what
for example leg press is technically
sort of one degree of freedom
because there's essentially like a few
joints going on the ankle joint doesn't
generate a whole lot of torque so we're
not talking about it
essentially you have a hips and the
knees okay and that's one degree of
freedom because it's n
minus one number of joints don't worry
about the science you should i'll make
sure this makes sense
if on a leg press you're stapled in
if you mechanically like neurologically
deaden the quads like you just turn them
off
right it's two snakes bite your dumb ass
right in the quads and turn off the
nerves
you can actually still do a full range
of motion leg press with your glutes
alone
because all you need to do is like your
foot is in the leg press
plate right there so it's not going
anywhere and then your ass
is in the seat it's not going anywhere
just by doing this with your glutes
pushing your legs down
you can press but no problem right
because there's only one degree of
freedom so you can take care of it with
just your glutes
so if you're using leg extension and
then going to the leg press
as your quads get really tired your
glutes can actually pick up a lot of the
slack which is
okay but then it becomes kind of crappy
pretty exhaust because your quads can
just sort of kind of turn off for a
while and rest
and then your glutes do more of the work
which has been shown in emg studies that
the actual non-pre-exhaustive muscle can
take over like that's not exactly what
we want
however what about two plus degrees of
freedom here's the thing what about the
squat
let's say you pre-exhausted with the leg
press and now it's time for you go to do
squats
if you're at the bottom of the squat in
the hole
and you try to come up using only your
glutes how the fuck
are you going to extend your knee with
just your glutes it's physically
impossible
because if you just do glutes you're
going to go
and you're going to fall backwards or
you're going to fall forward there's no
other way around it
or you have to generate teeny tiny
little momentum and kind of super
balance
and then somehow end up generating
essentially forces of the knee it's
almost impossible
if your quads are the limiting factor
before you squat
they will stop your ass dead in your
tracks in the middle of your squat which
is great
because then they reach really super
close to failure all the other muscles
don't
and we're in real good shape if you ever
try this it's completely unequivocal
what's going on
if you pre-exhaust your quads and you
try to squat you're coming out of the
bottom of the hole your quads do this
thing where they're
you're like uh i don't have quads
anymore and someone can't be like use
the rest of your body like the fuck am i
supposed to do that
what's going to extend my knees if
literally there's nothing holding the
top of me like i'm just gonna fall one
way or the other
right so ideally you want movements for
that compound post exhaust that have
more than one degree of freedom which
means dumbbell pressing
right dumbbell rowing stuff like that is
better
and free squatting and free exercises
are better than machine movements
for the post exhaust because in machine
movements and even in some barbell
movements you really can lock into place
and have the non-pre-exhausted muscle
help a
because it's a mechanically placed to do
that so
the best compound exercises to pick
after your pre-exhaust ones are
and remember the best pre-exhaust ones
are the ones that target the muscle
specifically it's its own limiting
factor as much as possible
and have the highest raw stimulus
magnitude like they're really really
good not pussyfooting exercises
now picking the post-exhaust exercise
right the compound movement after it
should highly use the exhaustive muscle
like close grip bench versus regular
bench right
other muscles are poorly leveraged to
help near failure
like when overhead press your tire
triceps it's just your triceps there's
no front delts can't hardly help at all
and other muscles can't help take over
via the degrees of freedom being super
low so it's not like you can like press
just with your glutes
you can't squat just with your glutes
you have to have your quads and if
they're tired they're the limiting
factor
right so just as a quick example after
you do an overhead extension
le with let's see easy bar close to
failure to failure with your triceps
can you go and do machine flat press
yeah it'll have some function it'll be
okay but
the pecs take over a lot and you're
trying something kind of rest because
you're
really they're really tired and your
body's really good as coach casten
points out a debate of like
reprioritizing to be like okay shit shit
my triceps are really tired i still have
to press this weight let's turn the pecs
on a ton okay
so machine presses can be a decent
pre-exhaust not the best right
it's better to do a barbell overhead
press we take the packs out and now the
front delts are really just dog shit
leveraged at this position
so it's really much better but even
better we do dumbbell overhead
press because at some point dumbbell
overhead presses okay
if you do your front delts the shit just
goes this way okay so there's no way to
make up for it it's
more than one degree of freedom and this
especially top lockout part after you've
pre-exhaust with overhead
extensions is fucking wildly difficult
and entirely on your tricep
if you pre-exhausted with overhead
extensions
and then switched to dumbbell overhead
presses and you were like i'm getting
tons of front delt work
bullshit your front delts are like oh i
guess we're going to do stuff
jk there's nothing for us to do right
they're going to be active but not
nearly as much as they would if they had
something solid to push on if they could
close the degrees of freedom if they
were stable
and if the triceps weren't so
pre-fatigued so give that some thought
and make sure the more boxes you can
check
the better your pre-exhaust training
will actually be okay
now so that's all good and well
pre-exhaust does some really cool stuff
for us
let's talk about what it does not do
let's talk about where it
may be better to do some other things so
here's the thing pre-exhaust
does not necessarily and often not at
all maximize
raw stimulus magnitude okay how much
oomph we can put in that muscle
fatigue completely aside okay
why because if you want the high raw
stimulus magnitude forget pre-exhausting
just do the highest raw stimulus
magnitude exercise
first and then the second exercise which
is often a compound
like if someone's like i want to get the
biggest packs i can i don't tell a
motherfucker to do flies first
you're going to do wide grip incline
first because that shit
really beats up your pecs huge raw
stimulus magnitude they're like yeah but
that's not pretty exhaust
why the hell are you worried about
praying exhaust we're not talking about
just training your chest there's nothing
wrong with your triceps going a little
bit too
we're talking about the best bang for
our buck
first when we're not fatigued pecs
wide grip incline or regular uh wide
grip bench just
as gnarly as possible forget pre-exhaust
okay if we want to grow
forgetfulness if you want the biggest
back ever you don't start
with like front lat pull downs right you
don't do that you start with bent rows
you start with weighted pull-ups some
hardcore shit
right that's number one okay and
okay even if the isolation first might
not maximize raw stimulus magnitude
okay a fatigued muscle can't max rsm
so for example if you do like packs
flies first and then you go to incline
bench you're like i'm still inclined
benching well okay the pack flies did a
decent job at stimulating packs they
also made them tired
now you have to take tired pecs into
your benching
use less load less tension throughput
your faster motor units especially
you're more tired
you would have been better off flipping
the other two around so if you want
straight up maximum pack hypertrophy and
you have no problem activating your pecs
with a wide grip bench
you probably almost certainly don't
start with the bench first and then go
to flies after
okay the pre-exhaust stuff is for a
little bit of a different purpose
right and limitation here is if
your pre-exhaust is done with a poor
limiting factor checklist like the
you know the compound exercises done
after have to have that checklist of
like three sort of categories
if you don't check the categories very
well it doesn't work very well right
so people will say like you know there's
actually studies that say that pec flies
before the bench increase activities in
the bench uh
sorry increase the um activity for
recruiting
the uh actual triceps okay what so we
did pre-exhaust
for dumbbells and then we got to the
bench and we did presses
and our triceps were more active than
usual and our packs less why
well because your triceps can take over
a barbell bench first of all
right because it's not two degrees of
freedom uh it's it's you know one
and then at the end at the same time
your pecs are tired right your pecs are
really fast twitch muscles
your pecs are like oh time to bench we
just did a bunch of flies so you
essentially do like a not so great fine
exercise not not the ideal exercise with
flies not the greatest recruitment
because a compound exercise does better
you do that sort of first and then
second you're already tired it's kind of
like
trying to maximize your eating enjoyment
experience can you guys tell i'm dieting
and trying to maximize your eating
enjoyment experience you have uh
like whatever normal tasting food first
and you get full on it
and then you have this amazing food you
were saving like this just not gonna
taste as good man like if you really
wanted to maximize your taste experience
come in with a fresh palate nice and
hungry and you'll really like the food
how it tastes
same thing if you have the best exercise
for pex which is barbell pressing
put that shit first okay don't put flies
first if you're gonna pre-exhaust it had
better be with something that
really nails the flies right maybe you
would have better off
been better off doing dumbbell flies
okay fine
and then dumbbell bench because on a
dumbbell bench your pre-exhausted pecs
the triceps can't help
the pecs have to do it on their own
because if you just think about this if
you just had to use the triceps to do
the movement it would go
like that your dumbbells would just go
out your triceps are like all right
we're doing it
blink right so your pecs have to come
close to failure they have to be
limiting factor
because it's not you're not limited by
the bar connected to the bar and can
press against it
it's two independent ones your pecs have
to turn off so maybe instead of doing
the barbell bench press after
try the dumbbell bench press but ideally
for muscles like pex
you usually don't even bother with
pre-exhaust unless you need it
specifically for things
only it can do and here's what we get
into the application of pre-exhaust
itself
pre-exhaust is great at a few things
fundamentally two
one is adding stimulus to tough to reach
muscles
okay it can turn compounds
for that muscle into very stimulative
compounds when they normally aren't for
example
let's say normally your triceps and
front belts you just feel a shitload and
dumbbell pressing
okay like they just really just do most
of the work and your packs they get just
mind muscle just crappy
you can't really connect with them fine
do a bunch of pack flies beforehand
your pecs get a pump their mind muscle
goes up they're more than
many factor now when you do dumbbell
presses the dumbbell press is good even
more
fractionally relatively a pec exercise
for you and can
really improve it right that's
definitely thing that can happen
now you're not this is a special
circumstance it usually doesn't happen
but if you really have trouble reaching
a certain muscle
pre-exhausting it can let you reach it
better with other compounds after
and here the second point is the number
one reason to do pre-exhaust
it's to maximize the stimulus to fatigue
ratio
okay stimulus to fatigue ratio is super
important because the raw stimulus
magnitude is great
but it can be so much fatigue it's not
sustainable from an optimal perspective
of long-term hypertrophy
stimulus to fatigue ratio can be
especially meaningful to folks that are
carrying a ton of fatigue already or
training so hard and heavy they can't
just blast everything they have to be a
little bit more nuanced with their
approach
right what does the pre-exhaust let you
do for sfr it lets you pre-exhaust a
muscle group
and not have to use a shit load of
weight on that compound after
keeping the total max weight for that
session
lower and making sure that you don't
especially beat up your joints and
connective tissues
and expose yourself to a huge risk of
injury okay
there's if you want to pause the shit
and read the dumbbell uh
flies and press example that's good but
what i'll say is here's the deal really
good
real example there's a reason why most
high-level bodybuilders
even though their quads are big enough
for it don't squat 700 pounds for reps
they can
but if they warm up and squat seminar
for wraps holy shit that's a huge injury
risk
it's unbelievably fatiguing emotionally
fatiguing nervous system fatiguing
crazy fatigue for the joints of
connective tissues i mean you don't just
have
700 pounds on your back it fucks all
your shit up top to bottom
instead not for the highest raw stimulus
magnitude but for the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio
most of these folks are doing leg
extensions or better even
leg presses and hack squats before they
go to squats
fucking toasting their quads awesome and
then they squat with four or 500 pounds
afterwards
in the post exhaust compound right and
then they get a pretty good workout
but so the stimulus is decent but their
fatigue is way lower than it would be
if they squatted first then did leg
press after you bet their stimulus would
be higher but their fatigue would be
like this
and possibly not like this but like that
when they tear their shit up right as
you load 700 pounds onto a squat bar a
lot of folks would be like man i'm not
trying to get hurt before this olympia
let's pre-exhaust first target the quads
and then we can move on
so tldr sort of a summary
the fastest twitch motor units
the biggest most growth prone parts of
muscle
work best with lower volumes and heavy
loads
okay so pre-exhaust is just not the best
strategy here
some muscles tend to be more fast twitch
than others which is why you'll notice
pre-exhaust is really not used much
even by higher level folks with them
hamstrings okay you pre-exhausted
hamstrings just another way of saying
tiring the shit out of your hamstrings
and when you go to your actual compound
like doing a bunch of
leg curls and then going to do good
mornings or stiff legged deadlifts
yeah yeah stimulus to feed ratio is fine
but honestly the rusty most magnitude
falls so much
that maybe it's not the best thing in
the world right for muscles like that
you want to go hard and heavy
first almost every single time now
second point the best overall gains in
many instances
will result without pre-exhaust just
regular training especially if your
total fatigue is not a realistic limit
like if you're young
you're lighter weight you're in college
you've got plenty of time to train your
stress isn't super high
just raw stimulus magnitude rows
pull-ups
benches squats the kitchen sink you
don't have to worry about fatigue
because you don't have to worry about
fatigue it's just not a realistic
concern for you
if you have a ton of exercises with
which to stimulate the target muscle and
there's no problem getting stimulated
you probably don't need pre-exhaust
why hell if you're not concerned with
injury or fatigue would you pre-exhaust
your chest with dumbbell flyers if just
doing a wide grip bench
fucks you up like crazy also wide grip
incline also normal also dumbbells you
have like six exercises to pick from
which can be done first which have an
amazing raw stimulus magnitude and
you're not worried about sfr
why would you pre-exhaust it makes no
damn sense you could pre-exhaust
if you don't have a whole lot of
exercise to train your chest with and
you really have trouble feeling your
pecs but if that's not the case
why do it and in most cases hardcore
compounds do a great job
they don't need any help right in that
case
you just want to stick to the highest
raw stimulus magazine moves the moves
that mess you up
the most fatigue be damned right however
you should consider using pre-exhaust if
you can't really fatigue a muscle
properly from whatever compounds you are
using
or even just with isolations alone you
can't get it pumped you can't get it
tired you can't get it sore
with isolations or compounds by
themselves then
especially if it's in a compound
isolation sequence so let's say your
quads
if you squat first and leg press after
you just see hips are tired your glutes
are
sore but your quads are like right maybe
if you flip the script and did
the leg pressing first and squatting
after now your quads are sore and tired
and your glutes feel okay okay mission
accomplished right but if that's not the
case
no reason to do it again another point
is if you want to keep stimulus and
fatigue ratio really high
possibly at the expense of raw stimulus
magnitude that's another concern
right you're not so concerned about
making sure your pecs grow as much as
possible
you just don't want to use 400 pounds in
the incline bench because you don't want
to tear your pec off
so you do 70 pounds of the dumbbell
flyer machine flies or something and
then 315 pounds for reps in your
uh in your bench presses or whatever
your inclines and then all of a sudden
the risk of injury to the pecs is much
lower
the fatigue is much lower and you can
just do more sets like that and get a
similar or same amount of stimulus no
problem but it has to be worth the
trade-off
right here's the deal pre-exhaust
for these reasons is an advanced tool
because it is only necessary for
advanced applications
and the real kicker it is actually
sub-optimal
for non-advanced applications if you
it's not just like
something extra you take so for example
if you have a car
and you put a supercharger on it it just
as far as i know cars which is fucking
dog shit i don't
any car with a supercharger just goes
faster okay
it's just an additive benefit the thing
is it's not
like this in reality this is like
putting racing tires on your car and
using it for daily work or winter tires
and using it in the summer
yeah for the application of winter
winter tires are better
but if you drive it around year long
they're worse for the summer like in a
bad way they scratch the
tire comes apart and there's worse gas
mileage fucks through the suspension
so it ends up being like you have to
have a good reason like winter
to put fucking winter tires on your car
so if you're like hey bro you want to
try pre-exhaust
not the way to go about it what is your
reason for pre-exhaust and is it
better use of your time than just
regular straight training
with compounds first if you can justify
it real well
welcome to pre-exhaust if you can't
stick to the basics folks
