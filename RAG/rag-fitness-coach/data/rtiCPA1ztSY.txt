The Rock doing belt squats with ton of
plates all the plates at the gym very
small range of motion they probably do
okay at training the adductors the inner
thigh certainly not the quads maybe a
little bit of glutes good good slapping
there the rock is so jacked oh my God I
think the rock is like the ideal man and
everyone else is just a shitty copy of
the rock myself included but um that is
not the best technique I would love to
see the Rockies about half that weight
maybe less get his feet a little bit
closer together stay upright and sink
down like three feet lower that would
torch his legs a ton
