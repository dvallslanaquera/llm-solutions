what are the best practices what can we
leave the table with so here's the deal
when you need to create a deficit cut
the excess fats first what's excess
anything above roughly like 0.3 grams
per pound per day so if you weigh 200
pounds then 60 grams of fat is good
enough to like check all the boxes for
hormonal activity and so on and so forth
in General Health you only cut carbs
when fat cutting is no longer an option
so if you have a lot of dieting left
over and you're already down so 60 grams
of fat at 200 pounds and you're not
losing weight as fast as you need to
it's time to cut some carbs
