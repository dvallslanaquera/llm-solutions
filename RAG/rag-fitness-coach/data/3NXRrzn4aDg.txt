one of my deep dark
secrets nothing like a deep dark secret
which you share in your promotional
marketing a lot of people have probably
heard of this it's basically an 8h hour
arm workout that's the secret you know I
would call an 8 Hour arm workout the
opposite of a hack a hack is like a
short cut you can just do a little bit
and get tons of results Rich was like
you know is there a way I can do way too
much to get question mark results let's
do it eight hours of arms it says it
consists of 16 mini workouts every half
hour for 8 hours straight it doesn't
take a scientist to logically understand
what I'm saying holy
 Yeah the more you put in the more
you get out so stoping making excuses
and you're going to make 16
shakes I thought I thought this was like
a meme
