are your children too tall for squats
tonight news at 11.
i am dr mike isrtel for renaissance
periodization and can you really be too
tall for squats
people sure say it all the time very
common claim
you know things like squatting is easy
for short or i don't get much out of
squats because that's because i'm tall
is there truth in this
turns out there's both truth and
falsehood as there are in many things in
life
namaste
isn't it great how spiritual i am i hope
you're spiritual too
the falsehood directly
just because you're tall it doesn't make
squatting any more problematic any more
difficult biomechanically anymore
anything
just means you have to move a bigger
absolute distance so a short person
moves a foot in half tall person moves
three feet when they squat at the hips
that means that per the same muscle
strength you have to load much less
weight on the bar
and that means it upsets you
that you're not very strong
seemingly because the external load is
very low and then you start to make
excuses like yes because i'm so tall but
in reality you're too weak you just need
to keep squatting and maybe this
wouldn't all be true
unless there was a few really good
examples of unbelievable squatters and
the best of which is hofdor julius
bjornsson former world strongest man six
foot nine you're probably not that tall
if you're watching this video now i know
someone's gonna comment i'm seven foot
four enjoy the nba while it lasts
hoftward us bernstein squatted 980
pounds in regulated competition
you're not too tall to squat
you're too weak maybe but hold on what
about the grains of truth
people with shorter torsos in relation
to how long their femurs are
are not so well built for squatting
they have to lean over forward more to
keep their center of gravity
over their feet because if it's any one
direction that you fall over
and
they have to use their posterior chains
a lot posterior chains become a big
limiting factor and thus they're limited
in how effective they can be at
squatting
and a lot of times not only can they not
squat as much but also because the
posterior chain is limiting their quads
aren't receiving a ton of the stimulus
and they're receiving plenty but
posterior chain might be at one rep in
reserve when you rack the weight your
quads might be at six reps in reserve so
it's really low quality training for
them and here's the kicker on average in
human populations
taller people tend to not always tend to
have
smaller torso to fema ratios which means
if you get a tall person a short person
compare them together if you compare
their sitting height how tall people are
when they're sitting shorter people look
a lot better all of a sudden and most
short people when they sit up they don't
look incredibly tiny in chairs they look
sort of normal and you can probably tell
us from like work meetings and um
classes you've been to through your
whole life like you can't really tell
who's tall and who's short when they're
sitting down nearly as well because even
the tall people kind of look normal and
then when the tall people stand up
you're like holy shit how much leg did
you have under that chair their femurs
and their tibia are so long
in relation to their tour so that when
they stand up they look way taller so
on average taller people
do have trouble with squats it's not
because they're tall it's because they
have not so great ratios their torsos
are too short for how long their legs
are you can have short people like this
it happens all the time it's not as
common but it's totally common in a
statistical sense that it occurs all the
time and then you're just not built for
squatting no matter what height you are
but it's not because you're tall
directly that this happens it's just
torso femur type situation interestingly
enough hofstra juice bronson has an
incredibly tall torso and his torso to
femur
relationship is what it would be for an
average person so he has no problem
squatting uh he did have a ton of
problems squatting back in the day when
he was young world's strongest man
competitor squat was super super low
because he was much skinnier so to speak
he was only 300 pounds and out 450 and
uh he was much weaker and he just got
bigger and stronger and ta-da he's a
great squatter but that's because he had
decent ratios to begin with if you have
crappy ratios you may never become a
very good squatter
so what can you do if you are tall and
or you just have really short torso
compared to long femurs how can you
still either get more out of the squat
or get more out of quad training in
general here's the deal
if you are in the situation you can play
with your foot position and your toe
angle such that you can stay as upright
as possible in your torso and still
squat as deep as you possibly can
just keep sinking those squats really
deep
because you have such a huge range of
motion out of your squat it will
probably be a big key in giving you huge
quads if you find a way to squat that is
quad limiting you could still stay
upright then that's a thing that you can
really milk out and it's going to be a
longer time to fill them out then if
you're short look short people we have
the edge appearance wise we take less
time to quote unquote fill out like you
get someone who's like 5'3 like about my
height i'm 5'6 damn it someone pointed
out accurately that like you know
everyone who really insists they're 5 6
is like 5'3 in reality i swear to god i
i i've been measured at 5 6 a bunch of
times a little while ago maybe i'm short
or not but in any case someone who's
like 5'3 when they're 200 pounds lean oh
my god they're like winning the 212
olympia they're so jacked they look like
muscle men right or muscle children at
that height and then if you're like six
nine did you could weigh 300 pounds and
people were like oh man you're pretty
skinny are you doing okay and you're
like fuck right so it's just gonna take
longer to fill out but once you do fill
out right uh you're gonna get way bigger
quads than the rest of us sure people
can get and you're legitimately gonna be
fucking enormous which is sweet like
sure people are never going to be legit
enormous i mean that guy's really jacked
for his height that sucks to hear it's
the thing but when you're tall like
you have the ultimate edge you have to
work longer and harder for it right so
it's kind of a double-edged sword uh
good thing is you get to eat more food
you get to have more fun training for a
long time and eventually you get more
jacked so that's kind of a good thing so
i would see it as kind of a little bit
of benefit and sort of a challenge
accepted kind of situation
if you are tall and you have a really
gnarly
torso to fema ratio what you can do so
so basically you've played around with
the foot positions and you still can't
really squat upright
what you can do is a couple of things
you can take your squats and you can
push them later into your program on any
particular quad day and you do hacks and
leg presses first because hacks and leg
presses take your torso out of the
equation then you can load them a super
super high amount get crazy pre-fatigued
quads and then your quads are super
limiting factor on squats afterwards and
then the squats kill you as well it's
the best of all worlds so i would do
that
i would definitely invest in healed
weightlifting shoes because if you kind
of raised heel you can push your knee
forward more and you can have more quad
emphasis in the squat
you can try a wider stance it might hit
your adductors a lot but if you're
pretty flexible a wider stance means
that viewed from the side your your
femur actually appears shorter so you
can stay more upright that's definitely
an option and you can focus on the
technical merits of the squat to be more
weight lifter style less power lifter
style which means you put the bar nice
and high on your back and you sit uh
basically you sit forward and down or
just straight down more than back and
down back and down you're going to have
to cantilever over your torso it's going
to be more limiting factor so you just
want to essentially stay more upright if
you use all of these
you know you're well on your way
to getting a lot of great quad training
and still even squatting in most cases
just not as a first exercise right
either way do your best no matter what
good lord gave you and follow your quads
stimulus to fatigue ratio whichever
exercises and techniques give you the
best stimulus and the lowest amount of
fatigue including back fatigue from
their axial loading and that's how
you're going to know what is best less
dogma more intelligence you're not too
tall to squat so if you're super tall
and i ever meet you in real life you had
better be squatting or else
see you next time
you
