hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization the topic of today was
something i mentioned in another earlier
video about steroids and this is the
recommendation that your first cycle
should be orals only for just a few
weeks to test the waters and here i will
explain my idea of why that is the right
idea in many cases
so
first
my best recommendation is not even to
get into any of this mess at all
you've hopefully watched and if you
haven't give them a look all of our
previous videos on steroids are for now
as of the recording this video is how
much muscle can you grow
just nanny
how much muscle can you grow from
steroids what are the differences
between natural and enhanced training
how does steroid use affect your diet
and how steroids harm you
and you probably concluded rightly that
you won't be using them
best choice uh for almost everyone
not quite everyone but almost officially
recommended by renaissance periodization
that you do not use steroids and by
yours truly as well for real
uh but what if you're still in okay
there's a small fraction of you a very
tiny fraction you've put in 10 years of
natty training and diet as i recommend
before you consider starting you're
informed you're committed and you're
ready to dip your toe in and here's the
thing
dipping your toe in is i think in this
case a very great expression for this
specific instance of trying steroids
because dipping the toe
in the pool right you don't know if the
water is too cold right that's why
you're not jumping in with your whole
body because a lot of cold blows and
just dipping your toes not that terrible
what if the water's too hot what if the
water is full of
crocodile shark hybrids
that's nothing you want because not only
do they have the bite force of sharks
and the swimming dexterity of sharks but
they also have the little croc uh limbs
though i don't i don't know if crocs
ever used their limbs for anything
combat related in any case the scales
and the tail it's awful right so before
you go into water that you don't know
anything about
you dip the toe now before you fucking
nerds say that well if you dip your toe
the croc pulls you in yeah
fine i get it but if you jump in
motherfucker for sure pulling you in so
better to dip than
to just get in there because we've all
seen the movies where like the teen
girls are in the lake and they're like
oh my god brandon come in it's so
awesome i don't know you guys just like
look kind of dangerous like come on it's
fun
oh my god my legs something pulling my
legs like i got jessica
they're croc sharks
i should be a fucking movie director
producer
writer scott
who does the creative shit in a movie
writer
screenwriter screenwriter yeah yeah yeah
that sounds hollywood in any case
starting almost everything slowly is a
wise idea
especially shit that can really fuck you
like crocodile sharks and steroids which
can for sure really fuck you
it's a good idea to ease into steroids
if you're going to do them at all this
exposes you to minimal risk and it
really tests your individual response
to
steroids to drugs so that you can back
off be like fuck that that's not for me
or push ahead if it really is for you
without paying a huge cost up front
now
how not to ease in is to take the
standard reddit advice no offense
redditers are great for many other
things
of
you know like fucking start injecting
250 to 500 mig's test
for 16 weeks or like fucking d ball
front load stupid shit like that
and all
per the forums you've got to have pct on
hand for sides
it's all about what we have on hand
that's how you do real internet cycles
um there are problems with this approach
of just starting injectable drugs i
counted at least six of these problems
first you have to inject stuff into your
body the needle is a very long it is
very scary there's you got to pull out
of a vial you put the shit in your body
there's blood it hurts it always blows
trust me it always blows it just blows a
little bit less over a year so the first
several months is going to be fucking
awful unless your needle happy it's
terrible it's nothing you want to have
to do especially when you're just
exploring right um it's kind of like the
difference between like hey do you want
a shot of alcohol at a party to see if
you're like you know you're 22 or 21 or
your first drink or you want you want to
take a shot or a mixed drink or do you
want to like inject alcohol into your
blood like what the fuck fuck that leave
me give me a shot let's start out slow
second point
if you start this injection of
testosterone you won't feel much for
multiple weeks it looks like i guess i'm
using steroids i don't know what's
happening and so that sucks for four to
six weeks only four to six weeks later
will you feel like the full power of of
of the drugs that are in your body so
you gotta wait a while to even see if
it's fucking worth your time
and if you don't like what's going on
like the secret uh some health problems
crazy acne psychoanxiety or something
like that which is pretty common um
you'll have to put up with it for like
at least two or three weeks even if you
stop cold turkey right there and there
because uh like testosterone ester is
like an anthocyanin which is typically
what you start with in this not so great
idea model then you just they they
digest or break down really slowly in
your bloodstream and in the compartment
or the muscle in which you inject them
and the bolus and and then it just for
two or three weeks you still feel like
shit so when you're really anxious and
you're like dude i can't be on these
drugs anymore get me out of here
okay you skip your next injection you're
like i still feel fucking awful and be
like oh yeah you got another fucking
yeah
two or three weeks of feeling a little
bit less like shit every few days fuck
that
right next up
if
you catch shit early and you stop
because you probably won't catch
anything for two or three or four weeks
you're still getting your natural test
production shut down
and
that's going to feel like shit and it
can take weeks to renorm back to normal
possibly longer in some cases
and that's when you actually need stupid
pct and all that other bullshit in real
life and it's just a whole big mess
whole big mess you might not have to get
yourself into so
my advice is to do something like the
following if you're insistent on doing
this and it's legal in your country etc
etc you're not cheating at sports you
can start with an oral like anavar which
is one of the safest drugs that they
have that doesn't mean it's safe is
safest
at like 20 to 40 milligrams per day by
the way this advice is exclusively for
males i'll get into the female stuff in
a bit
um
for like three or four weeks sorry 20 to
40 megs of anavar per day for three or
four weeks females the advice is much
different it's not just less anavar it's
all together different
do not do the above google joe jeffrey
physique collective he specializes in
this kind of thing give give that a look
and uh it'll sort you well on your way
all right so what are the upsides of
doing something like this instead of
starting to inject long aster
testosterone first you don't have to
inject shit you just swallow a pill
twice a day am pm easiest fucking thing
in the world
second you will feel the effects if
within a few days you feel orals faster
typically
and within just about a week or so
you'll feel kind of the full power of
the orals it doesn't mean they're going
to give you all the benefits right away
but psychologically and in the gym
you'll feel like okay shit's happening
right and you don't have to wait three
to four weeks it's just like a week
which if shit goes south you can cut
faster
to that end if you don't like what's
going on
and you stop taking the anavar
it just a few days later you don't feel
any of the bad things anymore okay so if
you like really have super high anxiety
from the shit which is not uncommon you
stop taking it a few days later you're
totally fine which is with the
injectable testosterone it's gonna
fucking take weeks and that's awful
so
if you catch shit early and you don't
like what you see a week after taking
anavar or something like that you're
probably not getting your test natural
testosterone production shut down in any
meaningful sense that doesn't take a
couple days to come back
nor do you have to put up with unwanted
side effects for too long which would be
its own bad thing right anxiety
depression sexual dysfunction happens
anger ultra high blood pressure back
pumps acne this all this kind of shit
happens from steroids within the first
several weeks and if you catch it early
and cut it off it can stop without you
having to be like oh shit this shit is
in my bloodstream for another two three
weeks i'm just getting more of the same
for a while
even if you do the entire four weeks of
the cycle and you stop cold turkey in
most cases within a few weeks later
full testosterone serum testosterone is
back okay or very close to full now in
some cases if you read the research
literature some people take a long time
some people never get their testosterone
back normal those are very very unlikely
so mostly it's fine most of the people
have ever dabbled with orals aren't like
in whenever it came off hasn't been the
same it's just not how it works
so
you basically in most cases with
something like nvr 20 to 40 migs for a
male for three to four weeks when you
come off
uh you just kind of feel normal after
you come off and there's not this like
oh man
five days after i'm like sleeping 12
hours a day my dick won't get hard it's
just not a very common experience
whereas if you come off cold turkey of
like a five or six week cycle of
testosterone because it took you until
week three or four to even feel much and
then you're like oh fuck i don't like
this you pull it out you're gonna be in
for
maybe a month or two of not feeling your
best
not a great trade-off if you ask me and
you did that's why you're watching this
video
so
what do you do after three or four weeks
is over
let's say you have a net positive
experience what do you do you can't keep
running worlds because they're not so
great for your liver also running worlds
for forever just not the greatest wave
certainly
health-wise and
money-wise and overall anabolic
throughput wise this is not the best
so you don't continue to do that but you
can switch to injectables like test
enanthate or something like that
maybe some primobolan in addition to
that depending on how you do things
again that's a broader travis joe
jeffrey question uh and you either plan
to come off in 16 to 20 weeks later or
you do in indefinite uh ramp blast
cruise blast cruise that sort of thing
you have a negative experience like
you're like ah fuck that that was
terrible
with the three to four week uh on the
world's only cycle
you can try it again
in two months
because all your shit's probably back to
normal
with a different phase like let's say
you tried during cutting maybe you tried
during massing or you tried to drain
masking track during cutting
with a different compound
with a different training phase
like you tried to draw a strength phase
but maybe you should try during a
perturb phase or just a different dose
of the same compound like you tried
40 milligrams of var and you got like
really great pumps but not so great
anxiety and maybe you try it again a few
months later with 20 milligrams and the
pumps are almost as good but the anxiety
is like zero then you're winning
and then
after that
you may be able to go back up in the
slide and get 16 to 20 weeks and get
into the real shit injectable or
you can just not hit the ship for years
and years and maybe come back to it
later or you could just not do whatever
uh because frankly
for your overall quality of life
steroids are overrated as fuck
and
take it from me
i have a clone in another universe
that's using them

youtube things and i'll see you next
time
