oh man it's good to be back dr james
dr mike welcome glad to have you with us
weekly webinar here to answer your
outstanding
youtube questions dr mike how's it going
it's going well
it's going well um i'm ready to get
going james
how are you doing i'm good i spent um
the last
week fixing my my cistern pump so i can
flush my poo away now which is great
and i don't think it's an exaggeration
to say that i have massive wood
at the property now but seriously i have
an
ungodly amount of wood better more wood
than less
yes it'll be toasty when you guys come
visit for new year's
oh excellent all right so
let us begin
yeah our first question asked her i've
paused the screen on myself looking
stupid
meat bag
got it ain't hard to find
hey james and mike can you go over how
to set up a long period of resistance
resistance training at maintenance four
or six months while your focus is on
another discipline specifically with
endurance training
um james go ahead this is all up your
alley here
yeah yeah so the good news is this one's
kind of hard to fuck up so you can't
really do it too badly
um when you're doing uh resistance
training at maintenance really the goal
all you're really looking for is just a
few kind of checkpoint items is not to
lose muscle mass
not to lose much work capacity in those
specific movements that you're working
on
and you know to maintain your technique
and so the good news here is
uh endurance training is going to follow
very largely the same
in terms of the resistance training
portion the same kind of periodization
that you would see
in most traditional sports so some
people think it can be kind of backwards
it's backwards in the sense of the
endurance training itself but not the
resistance training
so you're going to have a period where
you're going to be doing slightly higher
reps
and then you're going to have periods
where you're going into slightly lower
reps now for the most part we don't
recommend that you kind of dip into the
maximal strength range for endurance
training
but for the most part you're going to
have some periods where maybe you're
doing
somewhere around 10 maybe 10 to 15 reps
and then you're going to dip down and
maybe be doing
you know uh five to ten
and then maybe some periods where you're
just doing like five
something like that and as you already
guessed it's all gonna be pretty low
volume stuff so even your higher rep
stuff like your sets of tens
probably not doing more than two or
three sets per muscle group at a time
and maybe just two times per week
and then that number might actually go
down as you transition into your
strength stuff so when you're doing like
sets of five
you might only need to do like three
sets of squats per
week at that point just to kind of
maintain your muscle mass and your
technique because the intensity of the
lift is much higher
so um there's not a whole lot of fuss
here i know it sounds like a complicated
topic and the good news is it's not
really you're just dialing down your
training your resistance training to
maintenance volumes which is like
as mike and i keep joking about week to
week abysmally low
right which frees up a ton of time for
you to do all your endurance training or
if you wanted to
you know say another sport like soccer
or rugby or golf whatever
frees up a ton of time to do that kind
of stuff um
and then you follow what is you know
what i would call a very traditional
face potentiation
style program where you go from higher
ups to lower reps as you get closer and
closer to competition that's that's
really it
mike want to clean that up for me i
don't think i could do a better job than
that james
it's um it's just going to be much less
than you think
and it's really easy to figure out if
it's not enough because your abilities
will start to degrade
so if you're not degrading you're good
to go and if they're degrading you will
probably do a little bit more
and some people will make a case that
like you might
consider having a more robust strength
program
if you are um he said endurance so let's
just assume running
uh actually this is true for cycling too
sorry but um
if you're doing like a lot of terrain so
if you're going up and down a lot
it might be a little bit more bang for
your buck to have a little more a little
more strength training than just pure
maintenance strength training maybe like
mev level strength training
um just because it will help you on the
up and down portions but if you're flat
if you're just if you're like like where
i where mike and i grew up in the
midwest like you don't even
need to worry about that
all right next up
is thanos it was a very long question
but the answer to it is rather short oh
geez i didn't realize it was an expanded
question yes damn
god so okay what is your opinion the
best path to take
to be a coach for physique athletes
powerlifters sports etc
is going to college uh university to
pursue a degree in a related field like
exercise physiology even worth it
or seeking out mentorships and
experience a better route
i value knowledge extremely i feel from
the research i've done that college
prepares you for a clinical setting and
not to actually work with athletes
i can't find any good programs worth
attending that actually preparing take
my coaching skills next level and work
with athletes
the ones that i have found are all ms
and or phd programs in out of state that
not only do i not have the degrees to
attend them but even if i did i wouldn't
be able to pay for them well i guess
that kind of rules it out
um go ahead james yeah and that's kind
of an independent issue though right so
it's like if you're not willing to
travel or pay out of state tuition
that's kind of that's a different issue
for sure a bit of background on myself
what i'm currently doing to be a great
coach i was working this train for three
years before taking one year hiatus and
going another field it was much safer
and
more stable after realizing i hated
every single day of my life working in
this field i quit because i could not go
on
i've since returned to being a coach
though i know i only have a couple of
clients
i've been expanding expanding all of my
energy and educating myself to be as
best as possible
i've read almost 20 books during this
core team pretty much uh including
pretty much the entire rp library
nice that's cool damn busy three unpaid
internships over some my local reputable
mscs
coaches in the field so i can gain a
much more
uh so i can gain a much experience
working with athletes uh firsthand and
learn
from these coaches as much as i can what
should i do to
get my goals of being a coach should i
consider going to local
community college and taking some
courses there to increase my knowledge
or should i just keep the internships
and underexperienced people in the field
does dr mike and or james offer
internship mentorship program
possibilities to be able to learn
to be a good coach and work directly
under you and i'd be willing to do
anything in my power to work under any
and both of you including temporary
location
so just real quick you don't actually
mean that last part because we said kill
a child
in order to work with us you probably
wouldn't do it i hope uh it is
definitely under your power to be able
to do that
so you can just say i really want to do
it a lot
i'm just being a piece of shit thanos
because you know you've killed half the
world
uh i think you got it coming so uh james
i'll take a snap coming first
and then uh yeah please
so the first thing is that there's a
really big difference between the two
potential careers
one is in-person coach for athletes the
other is online
coach the online coach in person coach
are very different trajectories
um a very good uh
not optimal but very good trajectory for
online coach
is uh get yourself in a really amazing
shape
get a good following going by posting
lots of informative and performative
videos of
you doing stuff and pictures and so on
and so forth and try to comment on lots
of uh
instagram accounts and offer very
helpful very pleasant constructive
criticism
and people start to follow you and
whatever clients you have
at some point you know make yourself
available for coaching every now and
again on your instagram every two weeks
or something
put up and say hey i'm taking a few
clients here if you're interested let me
know and eventually the people will
trickle in
and then as you do a good job of people
they share their results you share their
results and eventually it balloons into
something that you're an online coach
and the way you become uh good enough at
doing this is twofold one you read a
bunch of books
and you watch a ton of youtube videos
and read a bunch online articles which
seem like you're doing already
uh and in addition to that you sharpen
your skills and
figure out stuff for yourself by just
training yourself a lot and training
your clients a lot and after
you know months and years of training
yourself and your clients you're going
to be getting onto some
really really really um awesome
experience that will give you
sort of all the experience you need to
be a very good coach that's it
that's for online um there's one
bottleneck there at the top
which is if you don't have a degree of
any kind you
have to become really really really
successful in order for a lot of people
to invest in you
and if you have a degree it's easier to
advertise yourself
so it's easier to be taken more
seriously when you perhaps don't have as
many clients so if you get a degree
the start of coaching is much easier and
potentially you can escalate uh
to going as very very high you know like
when i give a talk on youtube i'm
doctor mike israel i'm not just some
random guy in youtube though i'm also
that
right dr james often we're automatically
taken more seriously by you guys
and we automatically get clients way
more easy if we were coaches
because of that fact so degrees do have
that
but as far as do you need to learn
anything from the degree that you can't
learn through books and
online experience almost not okay that's
for online coaching
for in-person coaching it's very
different the
one does not simply show up and start
coaching teams usually those coaching
internships are offered
through collegiate programs of various
kinds then you probably have to do them
to get your best bet so if you want to
be a collegiate strength conditioning
coach even a high school strength
conditioning coach
a high school sport coach collegiate
sport coach you're going to have to have
probably a degree in something like that
and the more degrees you get the better
and then of course after you get your
basic degrees internships are everything
and that's absolutely super important
and of course
you should still be reading books you're
not going to learn a whole lot in these
degree programs
the degree programs are more like
vetting opportunities there are
opportunities to put a stamp on your
forehead that say you're not socially
awkward
at least very you're a fine person you
can be trusted to work with humans and
you've had some experience doing so
then you get in internships you learn a
lot you make a lot of connections and
then
you get your first opportunity to coach
as an assistant coach
or graduate assistant first then
assistant coach but eventually get your
own head coaching gig somewhere small
and maybe move up and then all of a
sudden boom you're a successful coach so
if you want to coach in real life
um uh actual athletes like parts of
teams
you're gonna have to go to the
university route if you want to coach
people as a personal trainer
and or if you want to coach people
online uh then
you don't need the university route and
it'll probably be uh
it's good to do it if we pay the cost
it's like a very long-term investment
it's just a very marginal positive
return so like you know 20 years after
you went to school
you'll be like oh it's really great that
i did that because now i'm doing so well
but for 20 years you'll be doing just
about as well without going to school
and making tons of money so your call on
that one
james yeah very very good insights um
one thing i think this kind of builds on
what dr mike was saying is that a lot of
people and i think
you might be in the same boat think that
there is just like a program that they
can go to where they learn everything
that you need to know about either being
a strength coach or a
personal trainer or whatever and that
just doesn't exist unfortunately you
know so there's a lot of
complexes oh oh sorry my dogs are here
um
there's a lot of complexities in
coaching and the thing is like
you go to college first to get exposure
right so as an undergraduate you go to
get exposed to new things
open your mind up a little bit and
hopefully give you a better idea of what
it is that you're most interested in
when you get to like a graduate school
program your mentors there are not
going to teach you everything that you
need to know right they're going to say
hey look
that's the mountain you need to climb it
here's the few things that you might
need along the way like you need some
good boots you need some good socks you
might want to bring a water bottle you
might want to bring a rain jacket
but you still got to get up that
mountain right and so you can you have
to kind of understand that
graduate school is more of an
opportunity than it is like a uh
like they're providing you something
they're not providing you with what you
need to know
they're providing you an opportunity to
figure it out with some guidance and it
comes down to you so there's no program
out there
that you will find that will set you up
to be a collegiate strength conditioning
coach to be a physique coach to be a
powerlifting coach
you name it this doesn't exist what it
will provide
you with are opportunities to learn more
about what goes into those types of
things and as mike was saying sometimes
that just means getting your feet wet
with
working under another strength
conditioning coach i think
i've i've i'm trying to say this in a
way that's not offensive i've my opinion
on things like sports psychology has um
i used to take a very harsh stance on a
lot of these things and i think i've
softened up a little bit over the years
because you start to figure out coat
whether it's personal training online
coaching strength conditioning
being a good coach is all about like
having really good interpersonal
relationships with people like
getting them to do what you want them to
do it doesn't matter if you know the x's
and o's better than anyone else it's
really like can you connect with this
person
can you get them to trust you and
respect what you have to say and get
them to
do the gist of what you want them to do
and hopefully what it is that you want
them to do is the right thing
but it's really um taking them from a
place
of like i need guidance
all the way up to building them up to a
point where they say i am
pretty self-sufficient but i want you to
have my back in case i fuck up
right and that's a long journey that's
like that's what being a really good
coach
is in many cases not all but many cases
and
there's nothing that can teach you that
outside of getting into the field
and just working at it and getting a
little bit better every day so
i might that's a long ramble for me to
just kind of say temper your
expectations about getting a collegiate
education
because there's nothing that's going to
give you this experience how do i become
a great
strength conditioning coach or a great
online coach or whatever
you're never going to find that all
you're going to find are a lot of really
good people who are
good at some niche thing and they can
help you
get a little bit better at that niche
thing or the things surrounding that
niche thing
but you have to take that journey you
have to climb that mountain yourself so
just
keep that in mind and i think dr mike's
suggestions were really good
but when it comes to being a good coach
you just
you got to get in the field and you got
to work with people and like i still
i don't fancy myself a great coach
because more so now i think i'm just
more conscientious of all the fuck ups
that i make all the time
where you realize you've adopted a
strategy with someone
that doesn't work for them no wonder
they're not responding no wonder they
don't have accountability no wonder
they're not compliant it's not because
they're the dickhead it's because you're
the dickhead because you didn't figure
it out
you know what i mean you're the one
who's supposed to know better so it's
one of these things um
sorry for the long ramble on this one
but i just i feel very strongly about
this and i think coaching is just one of
those things like
you watch some of these and i'm a big
fan of mma you want some of these mma
coaches and you see the relationships
that they have with some of their their
guys and it's like
you can't get that at a university you
get that from living
breathing sleeping training eating
everything with that person
they become an extension of yourself at
some point
and so that's that's kind of worse than
that
all right in thanos uh we don't offer
any
in-person internships uh every now and
again i do an online internship but
um the applicant pool for that is like
10 people deep so it'll be like forever
you can come intern with me if you want
to learn how to use a chainsaw i'm
getting pretty good
but you gotta start at the bottom bitch
stack that wood up that's right you
don't even get to look at the saw
uh-uh maybe you can start it someday bro
someday hold on
one sec almost almost almost got oh my
god this needs oil
uh all right next up
oh got it ready
if during the warm-up i noticed that i
won't perform as well as expected under
what circumstances is this better to do
a light day
to post or postpone my planned workout
to the next day so actually i would uh
that's a simple
question yeah i'm gonna be a dick and
preempt it you don't notice it during
your warm-up
because you should do at least one
attempt at a work set unless you feel
completely fucked like if you're last so
let's say
you're doing sets of 10 and you do a
double to potentiate before your set of
10 at the same weight your set of 10 is
going to be
if that double feels like an rpe 9
then you should almost
certainly do a very light day or a
technique only day or whatever rpe
three to six half the volume half the
load
something like that and just chalk that
up
and then keep going with your weak as
normal okay
uh the next day i'm not a huge fan of
because it really fucks up the rest of
your week going forward potentially
and there's nothing ever wrong with
taking a light session if you really
just can't do the workout here's another
thing remember
auto regulation and hitting the target
rps or whatever builds a lot of room for
not having the greatest fucking workout
ever every time
so in order for us to say you should
take a technique only session or light
session or whatever you want to call it
a recovery session we have to already be
performing
really really poorly and that's
something one day of rest
might not fix like 50 50 and then you
get a real bad thing there's a 50
chance you will fix it but 50 you won't
and then you literally go to the next
day and you're like all right i can't
train still
but like oh my god like i've pushed all
my workouts up a week everything's
fucking chaos what the fuck is going on
so i would say try unless so so
several part answer first unless your
potentiation set is like an rp9 or some
shit
it's supposed to be an rp3 uh
just try a work set because a lot of
times you feel like shit during warm-ups
and
your work set goes great and you're like
ah alright if your first work set
doesn't go amazing try another one
and then you can always shut it down
after but a lot of times you'll be like
oh
it's really pretty cool i remember i had
a workout once was squatting 440
and i was supposed to hit it for
um i think
four by ten or something like that and
i got nine on the first set and i was
like
oh my god so what did i do i put my
headphones in turned on my music
and i got 11 10 10. it just fucking did
it
and that was didn't fuck me up a whole
lot like more than i was expecting
anyway
so it just happened you know so don't
give up that easily it takes a lot
to take a light session and because it
takes a lot
to decide to take a light session just
delaying one day probably isn't a good
idea and you also get away from the
the fuck ups of split you know moving
your whole routine
uh backwards and forwards if you're
gonna push your workout up or back
up or forward one day it should be for a
reason you're aware of before you go to
train for example
did you get no sleep last night you
should just be making the decision in
the morning like
i'm just going to do a workout what day
later and that's kind of okay
depending on circumstances a lot of
times you can still ride through that
with caffeine
so that's that's my input on it james
yeah and i'm really glad that you
highlighted that you don't stop during
the warm-up from a performance
standpoint you stop when you have
clear indication that your first set
didn't go as planned
right um i'm a really big fan of this
question
and i think dr mike hit it out of the
park one thing i would add is that there
are
there are some circumstances in which i
would stop drawing during
a warm-up excuse me for repeating myself
um but they are not
performance mediated they're
psychological so if you find yourself
warming up and you already had a really
hard time just making it to the gym
maybe you got to the gym and were
procrastinating for like 10 or 15
minutes you're like
i'll make my way over to squat rack
sooner or later and you feel
anxiety nausea just hatred
self-loathing all these things as you
are walking up to whatever it is that
you're gonna do because you just
don't want to do it you would rather be
doing anything else in the world
and you start warming up and you're
starting to find like anxiety
frustration sickness type symptoms these
are classic like burnout things and
that's one of those things where
if i was coaching somebody and they are
starting to like kind of
signal these things to me i'd be like
you know what
why don't we just call it a day why
don't we just either take a light
session or maybe why don't we just go
find something else to do today
that would be one of those times where i
would be suspicious that the athlete
is suffering from burnout and at that
point that might be an okay time to stop
during the warm-up
but as dr mike said from a performance
standpoint
that is too fickle that those feelings
can wax and wane
too easily sometimes so you need to
confirm by having a bad set
now that doesn't there is a subgroup of
people
who will use kind of sport sciency terms
and thought processes
to for a lack of a better term and
pardon my language but to puss out more
or less right so they're like
oh like i don't feel great today oh my
rpe
yeah exactly and it's like shut the fuck
up and just get in there and
do what you're supposed to do right mike
and i our big fatigue management people
right so like
don't get us wrong there is there is a
time and a place
to take those types of actions but more
often than not you just got to fight
through that
that inner thought of like i should take
it easy today fuck that
give it a try right try do what you're
supposed to do
and if you're supposed to get 10 reps
and you get six reps
and the rir is way off from what it
should be there you go
now you have a good reason to take a
light day 100 we would back you up on
that but if you're like
doing your that's like it's this is this
is like the quintessential
uh uh uh buff sheba wimpy sheba
meme like don't be the wimpy sheba right
be the boss sheba
all right lotus dreams
looks like the algorithm did pretty good
today huh it did okay i go way lower
afterwards after like five more of these
the next like
nine upvote questions are like 30
questions down it's like
oh no never mind spoke too soon
all right very broad question here but a
big one nonetheless if you factor in all
the variables that would constitute
maximum hypertrophy
which are the ones that we should spend
most of our time slash efforts in i'm
thinking some sort of a priority when it
comes to diet sleep training etc
i'm asking uh this because people often
get lost in minor things of training but
never worry about proper sleep
hygiene we should never feel that
perfect way more imo
uh i got this one you ready resistance
training
top of the list 90 i'm obviously
excluding factors like genetics here
since we don't have any needs to change
much about them but it's just a short
ranking where the biggest contenders are
what they make or break the best
perspective program so actually i got
the pretty good uh answer for you just
rough sort of off-the-cuff answer we'll
see if james can clean it up for me
number one most important thing is that
every time you come to train you train
sufficiently hard
which means you're training close to
failure and with a volume that is not
nominal
okay that sounds like something i know
um overload
hey how about that one strange second
frequency
make sure that you are doing that thing
training hard
like more than once a week for the same
muscle groups
probably like two to four times a week
is where your baskets are it sounds like
something else i know
strange strange thing uh i'm not even
gonna mention specificity we're skipping
that training principle because if you
don't know to do curls to get big biceps
none of this can help you right um so
those of you who don't
haven't figured out he's basically
reiterating the training principles in
like the lay person fast
so you're training hard number one each
time
secondly you're training frequently
enough to make the best gains two to
four times per week usually is the best
per muscle group the next thing
of importance is to consume a sufficient
amount of food
to drive anabolism which means protein
and calories okay
so that's thing three and thing four is
getting enough sleep rest and relaxation
uh to make all of that uh actually go
towards muscle growth
um some of those would be really
technical which we won't some of those
are driving
forces some of those are permissive
forces only that is they don't actually
make any
sleep doesn't cause muscle growth if you
just get a lot of it you don't train
training actually causes muscle growth
but sleep has a huge permissive effect a
huge
amplification effect we're gonna get all
that philosophy bullshit off to the side
there you go first train hard when you
go to the gym
second fucking go to the gym pretty
goddamn often and not too infrequently
third make sure you eat plenty of food
plenty of protein fourth make sure
you're getting plenty of sleep rest
relaxation
fifth would be like deload when you get
tired and repeat
and honestly if you say but what about
progression progression happens
automatically if you just follow the
first thing of like make sure your
training is hard
because if the shit you used to do isn't
hard anymore you'll automatically infer
that you got to do more of it
that's it so there's your top four right
there james
did i fuck anything up no i think you
did a great job and just to maybe
tangent slightly uh most of these
parallel what we have
done in the recovering from training
books so lotus dreams if you haven't
if you haven't read recovering from
training what dr
mike said is largely the same thing that
we say
in the recovery from training book with
some other we go in a couple different
directions but it's
mostly the same so if you haven't
checked that out check that out
next up right below lotus dreams
shirag makhija
that's a cool name yeah
[Music]
all right ready ready how is
cardiovascular and muscular endurance
affected by muscle
with some fat gain so basically gain
some muscle and fat how is
cardiovascular and muscular drugs
affected
also how long can one maintain their
cardio muscle endurance without directly
training them
like doing uh reps in less uh than 15
rep range and zero cardio sessions
and then he says do you recommend doing
cardio in a ppl
rest repeat split which basically has me
working like six days a week
so is doing some intense cardio on the
seventh day good idea so i'll just start
from the back
no one day of cardio in the week does
almost nothing as a fucking giant voice
every time you've got two party at least
twice probably three times to get much
out of it
and it gives you zero rest days at that
point yeah which is really fucking so
don't definitely don't do that
uh secondly uh it is affected in
proportion to how much fat you gain and
how much weight you gain
and how much time you spend away from
cardio uh
the biggest thing is how lean are you
and also how much training volume are
you doing
if you stay relatively lean gaining
mostly muscle very little fat
and if you're doing lots of training
volume lots of sets close to failure and
you're helping them having between sets
your card is actually pretty decent from
someone for some amount of time
if you do training with relatively low
volumes
and a fewer number of sets if you don't
push each step as close to failure and
if you gain lots of fats
especially quickly then your cardio is
affected much more rapidly much more
deltariously
and lastly you don't really have to uh
ponder these things so much you just
have to find out
how much cardio probably three times a
week for 20 minutes at a time of
relatively intense cardio whatever
modality you want to preserve
does a real good job of preserving it
kind of indefinitely at a pretty high
level
so don't seek to ask the question
necessarily for yourself
it's a great theoretical question but
for yourself the better question
is how much cardio can i do to maintain
my cardio versus
how fucked up will i be if i do no
cardio at all the answer is like
incrementally more fucked up the longer
you haven't done it the more weight you
gain
but you can prevent a lot of that loss
yeah that was very good and um so cardio
is very much like strength
in that it's contextual right like your
strength on a certain movement can wax
and wane if you don't do that movement
same thing with cardio where like your
running performance can degrade
seriously if you don't run for a while
so in this i think in this question it's
good to differentiate kind of like your
um
your vital like resting vital cardio
stuff versus like your actual cardio
cardio stuff because i think that's kind
of more what you're getting at here
so you can run into some cool situation
cool these interesting situations
um where if you're gaining muscle mass
and fat mass at the same time
your um kind of like your vital cardio
can actually go down
whereas like your sport specific cardio
or modality specific cardio can go up
and your muscular endurance can't go up
as a result of muscle gain
not always but that can absolutely
happen especially
uh one of the things that we see very
much with
uh hypertrophy is just gaining work
capacity and that's another way of
saying muscular endurance in some cases
so
you can actually see your muscle
endurance going up the problem as mike
already mentioned is how much body
weight and how much fat are you carrying
around
which will definitely make your kind of
modality specific cardio suffer in some
cases especially if it's running
and your vital signs cardio kind of
stuff like your resting heart rate your
blood pressure stuff
will tend to degrade um here's the other
thing
is that your muscular endurance
will tend to linger around as long as
you are not losing muscle mass and not
completely
inactive like as long as you're not
being a total piece of shit uh
whereas your modality specific cardio
actually will start to degrade
very rapidly comparatively so what we
find with
cardio stuff is that you will actually
start to see decreases in your
cardiovascular performance if let's just
say running for example
maybe in as little as like two weeks if
you stop doing it it goes away
very very quickly so it's one of those
things where if you take fancy yourself
like an endurance athlete
you don't take much time off of doing
something because it does tend to
degrade
a lot faster than things like strength
because strength is more based on your
muscle mass
and like long-term nervous system
changes and those just don't go away
very easily as long as you're
somewhat active so uh we would kind of
differentiate those things
and well i would say in terms of cardio
we'll be looking at like your vital
signs and your health
kind of related factors and then
whatever activity factors that you're
doing
and then the muscle can be can respond
very differently depending on what's
going on so
i would say if you want to take another
crack at this question next time i'd be
interested to take
to take it again uh and if you had some
kind of specific
metrics or instances that you were
talking about i'd be
keen to talk on it a little bit more for
you
yep uh there's a yeah it's
it's one of those where the specifics
matter a lot more the generalities take
30 seconds to explain
and then someone's like well how much
actual cardio does this mean and you're
like
well what's the rest of your program
look like what level of fitness are you
at
yeah and are you doing it for health or
you're doing it to actually be better at
running or cycling like
those are big differences
i've been using the rp diet to fill my
weightlifting performance for years and
rp's simple science-based approach has
been instrumental to my success
with the new rp diet app following rp's
principles is as easy as entering my
goals and schedule and choosing my
favorite foods the app builds a diet to
my exact needs reminds me to eat my
meals and adapts to my body's changes
every single day and week
the rp diet app is a huge help in my
quest to become the best athlete i can
be and if your goal is to be your best
it will help you
all right next up is calausosaurus
oh it's a dinosaur name it's sweet i
love it
uh hello and james here's my question
how do you accommodate for synergist
muscle volume and compound exercises
for example how many sets of biceps did
i do in three sets of pull-ups assuming
my biceps does not hit
rar 3-0 i'm a big fan keep up the good
work so
eventually probably several years later
because we have so many video outlines
that will probably be several years
later before you see this
we're going to have a video that
addresses exactly this question which is
this unbelievably
common question that for some reason i
haven't made a video yet to address
uh mostly because it's not very
important in the grand scheme there's
way more important stuff to talk about
here's the thing right there's
fundamentally there's probably more
there's like three or four ways you
could slice this but we're just going to
talk about two really quick
one is the very specific particular
method and two is the the opposite
very simple method the very specific
particular one
is to try to estimate fractional
contributions okay which means you start
with a guess
okay you say okay i kind of feel like my
biceps
are contributing like for every set of
pull-ups
my biceps you still enter james
yeah sorry i was trying to full screen
you a little bit so people could see
your face
oh no jeez uh for every set of uh
pull-ups my biceps feel like they get
like
maybe half a set of stimulus or a third
of a set of stimulus that they would
from like something like curls which is
one set equivalency
for biceps and then you start with an
estimate and over money
many many mesocycles you widget that in
to fine-tune it as you can wide grip
pull-ups it's actually like a third
on close-grip underhand pull-ups it's
actually like one on regular pull-ups uh
neutral grip it's like half okay so then
you get really really detailed and you
can just add all that up and it works
for every other exercise bench press
triceps
you know um dips and pecs all that stuff
it's possible to do that uh but there's
a simpler method the simpler method is
you only count direct work period
because you assume that you're always
trying to train the rest of your body
and you assume that roughly the amount
of indirect work is kind of the same or
very similar methodology
so it just cancels out you say like
what's your mrv for bison so if you go
15 and someone's like you know does that
include like like uh underhand
rowing and does that include like pull
downs oh
fuck no oh what was i thinking
like my real bicep rv is actually way
different
and i need to recount the shit that
already somebody basically does
if it's the same shit every muzzle cycle
that you count in why the fuck would you
count it
right it it it's it's it's like how many
extra calories do i need to eat on top
of what i normally eat to gain weight
and someone's like well what do you
normally eat like no no i said extra
calories i always eat the same thing
every day
just worry about the extra okay it's
like i'm a better analogy it's like all
right
you have a meeting with engineers to
build a rocket you're like alright make
sure you get all your meals and use the
bathroom because we need you alive to
build this rocket they'll be like
what the fuck like i assume we're going
to keep doing that right someone's like
are they going to stop
our meals and stop our ability to use
the bathroom later be like no no no no
i'm just making sure you guys have it
like if it's always in place you don't
need to worry about it so
james and i honestly to be honest in our
own training we really only count direct
volume
until and unless we have an exercise
which is supposed to be
indirect but we know what fucks us up so
for example we just know it's going to
be a bigger hit so
when i do a machine flies i know it hits
my biceps
considerably and i'm like yeah that
really is a bicep hit so i factor that
and i'm like okay i'm going to do less
biceps because i know i'm doing some
more here
and that's as far as you have to take it
can you do the fractional accounting
sure
have i ever seen anyone make a
difference in their training with really
meticulous fractional accounting
never ever uh
yeah and like i recommend against it the
only times that would even matter is if
you make
very drastic changes to your kind of
typical program like
let's just here's an extreme example you
took out pull-ups or pull-downs and did
only like straight arm pull variations
right at that point it's like okay well
clearly this is going to affect my
biceps so i need to make some course
corrections on that but it works itself
out either way
so this issue to me is kind of like uh
this is when we get with clients all the
time actually it's the net carbs versus
total carbs it's like
yeah it doesn't matter we do one and it
will work itself out as long as you keep
doing it that way
as long as you don't go from net carbs
and then the next mezzo you do total
carbs
you won't have any problems as long as
you do it the same way over time it
works itself out
let me write that down real quick so
what we can make a video out of it later
i'm glad this actually came up so i
don't know if this is if i'm spilling
the beans i don't think i am because
i've sent emails to everyone
involved and i've gotten the thumbs up
but i was um
thinking about doing um an audiobook
version of how much should i train
and one of the things that i wanted to
do is have an opportunity for mike and i
to shoot the shit about what we've
learned about the volume landmarks uh
through just over the years of using
them but then also have
some direct specific q a type stuff
where people can ask questions and this
is like the perfect one of the perfect
like
questions that we get all the time how
do i count fractional
sets or should i even bother doing that
that's a really good
good one to put on the list
all right let's take a look at
jr's question down a bit below there
under fake maddie under fake natty fake
daddy i would love to answer your
question but unfortunately
this is democracy and you only got three
votes
maybe if you were real maddie you'd get
more votes you ready james
[Laughter]
yeah steroid user fucking
says question training volume for large
calorics or calorie surplus
versus small calorie surplus would you
recommend training a little closer to
minimum effective volume for a lower
calorie surplus
backstory in my early 40s i have no
desire to go through large bulky and
cutting cycles plus
i like fading my clothes and fitting for
a while lol
i prefer to gain maybe a pound a month
then do a mini cut once a year i've been
keeping my surplus around 125 250
calories a day thoughts my first thought
is you don't actually have the accuracy
to make that statement
just being a dick jr but to be honest
125 150 cals a day is tough surplus to
make sure you're in a surplus
you walk to your car a couple extra
times and there goes your surplus
but if you're reliably gaining a pound
for a month and you can actually see
those gains
um that's fine and uh training volume
uh you know i'll put it this way uh you
if
your calorie surplus is higher
then uh you can both so your average
training volume won't change
uh because you can start your mesocycles
at a lower volume and still grow muscle
and you can also end your mesocycles at
a higher volume and still grow muscle
uh so the average doesn't really have to
change but definitively at the end of
your mesocycles
the hardest highest volume phases can be
higher with a bigger surplus
for sure there's just we won't be able
to recover if your surplus is smaller
and that's anecdotally something you're
going to find
uh james and if you auto regulate just
to build on mike's point
it forks itself out again kind of like
the last question where it's like well
if i want to
uh eat more eat less like how should my
training be affected well auto regulate
your training from what you normally do
and it works itself out that's
the answer yep so basically like a quick
example
can i can i just read this
go you first go ahead mine's bullshit uh
my fish finished the finish yeah just a
quick
example if you're um
you know when you're sort of like your
third week of training your fourth week
is the last one before a deload
at the end of your third week if you're
on a larger surplus you're going to feel
pretty good
and you're going to be able to add some
sets if you're on a small surplus you're
not going to feel nearly as good and
you're like i'm not going to add as many
sets that's
that's basically an example of how it
would work james go ahead and read
philip doyle's
comments that's exactly what you knew
read my mind you knew i couldn't help
myself
damn it all right
this one was too funny shout out fashion
tips for james
plaid shirt check carhart vest
check half mesh snapback cap
sort of check with your favorite tractor
truck brand i don't have like a kubota
or a john deere hat but i have plenty of
snapback hats
even though i have a gigantic head
embrace the culture
fell tree check plow field check men
defense
check you are become man provider of
needs buyer of tools
you will want for nothing save more logs
to split
damn i've split so many fucking logs
this last week
i took down we took down like what six
trees and then one
tree that was like basically two trees
that had
one tree that had split into two trees
so basically like eight trees
holy shit hard work
yeah but i'm getting good on that
chainsaw car
fuck that and i'm not running the
country
all right oh did i tell you that's uh
that bear showed up again
oh fuck there's a bear that's scary
hilarious fuck he we have a couple apple
trees on the property and he uh he shows
up and he reaches up and he eats the
apples out of the tree so he'll like
shake the branch and a couple apples
will come down he'll sit on his butt and
he'll be like nom nom nom nom nom
and then he'll go to the other tree and
do the same thing kind of rinse and
repeat for
a little while that's pretty funny wow
is he a brown bear uh i think he's a
black
he's a black bear who is colored brown
okay so he's smaller not as insane or
whatever
yeah absolutely i mean i still wouldn't
want any part of that but he's far
enough away where i can
watch him through the binoculars and
have a laugh for sure
all right um i've already did 11
questions this time because i missed a
guy who actually has a great question
let's go down to nickels nichols is
all the way down way way low
um probably about two thirds of the way
down scroll wise
okay still scrolling
[Music]
fit boy oh fit body advise that's a
funny one
nichols got it yep
all right
let's get this going
what is your opinion oh let me check to
make sure we're on the same page with
james
and we are perfect what is your opinion
on a 14 day strategic reconditioning
phase
where you stop training like brian
haycock suggests every time in my
lifting career where i can't keep adding
load even after
10 percent reset the only thing to help
when i stopped lifting for an extended
amount of time and came back to
this was never strategic but due to
burnout however i always ended up better
than my last time on my peek is there
anything to this method uh is there a
better method to avoid right now yeah
the better method is deloading for one
week
by much less than 10 however 14 days for
strategic time
reconditioning is called an active rest
phase in sport science
research and it's a thing it's great so
it's a great thing you just don't need
it all the time you can deload and
most of the time deloads are good enough
yeah it's kind of like um what you're
asking is like what's the best way to
get to the grocery store
when i drive should i hit the
accelerator as hard as i can and hit the
brakes as hard as i can
every single time or should i just
cruise at like a more comfortable speed
and
accelerate and stop when i need to like
i think the latter is probably a better
way to go about it
boom
all right lucio castro who's just
right under that
oh so many spicy names
got it he says hi mickey james first
thank you for all the work you provide
for free which has been incredibly
helpful in my fitness journey in so many
ways
i have two important questions that i
can't seem to find answer anywhere
number one watching the metacycle
progression debate in the arrive
stronger podcast an idea popped up into
my head
is there any data to know for how much
you could train at mrv or close to it
versus how much time and comparison
can you train at least a few cents below
mrv the reason i asked this it seems to
be
to me that the additional benefit of
trading closer to mrv is eclipsed by the
great amount of fatigue that comes with
it
yes we have in many cases yes yeah and
the fatigue does not impede progress
however with your current model of
training three weeks and deloading one
week
uh it's not my current model of training
but that's an example
sure we spend only 75 of our time
actually
training hard and if you additionally
take into account the first week
it was really like to begin with we only
spend really 50 percent of the time
training optimally no that's not true
the first week
that's not true uh isn't this really
time inefficient would it be better if
we figure out mav or mrv
and train conservatively below it for
most of the year eighty nine percent
deal it only unnecessary so
uh yeah uh lucio's good good good
questions you gotta spend a little bit
more time thinking
these things through and that's not me
being a dick it's just fact of the
matter
um you only deload when necessary anyway
okay
um whether you hit mrv or not
is not up to you if you're deloading
when you're ready to deload you'll hit
mrv anyway
it just might take longer if you don't
accelerate the volume as quickly
so it's going to be shorter if you go
like this with your volume it's
you'll hit mrv faster if you go like
that with your volume even if you go
like this with your volume and stable
eventually mrv will come down to you
just because of accumulated fatigue
and then you'll have to deload so we hit
mrv dealer anyway
if you're saying we should deal it
before we hit mrv you're really making
an argument for inefficiency because you
could have had one more productive week
of training why the fuck are you dealing
right
so we're really asking the question is
what are the extremities at which
um we're either in order to not deload
for long we're training so easy
especially the beginning of the mouth
cycle that we're wasting
time uh that's one extreme and the other
extreme is
we ramp up volume so quickly that we
over exaggerate injury risk
and we spend like way too much time
delaying as far as the research on that
is suggested at least in beginners
and a lot of just obviously it's hard to
call this anecdotal observational data
on advanced lifters i would say it's not
anecdotal because everyone is in
consensus about this
it's possible to make an argument that
two to one accumulation to deload
paradigm two weeks of hard training one
deload and repeat
is excessive as far as not very
efficient um
but we know that delayed training
adaptations are a real real thing
so anything that three to one and above
and definitely four to one and above
is probably traded off a right around
even to anything
up to for intermediates eight to one
four intermediates and above
james and i in our collective experience
if you try to design them as a cycle
which is more than eight to one paradigm
like
you're trying to design a motorcycle
with stranger for nine weeks straight
uh without a need for a deload
motherfucker the first three weeks of
that shit
are a huge waste of fucking time because
in order to not accumulate fatigue
you're going way easier than you should
be proper training
proper in most contexts is about
starting at the minimum effect of volume
not aggressively but
fucking ramping it not necessarily just
by volume maybe not volume at all but
load and
rpe and rar getting into the mix
getting to a high level of fatigue not
too soon but in that middle ground
and then deloading uh very confidently
considerably
and then restarting the process if you
try to bias your training in one
direction too
too much you're going to fuck yourself
over so if you try to like
do 20 sets 25 sets deload
that's probably freaking stupid if you
try to do like five cents and then five
sets
and then five sets and then six sets and
then six sets and six sets where your
med is like
fucking you know let's say your mbt is
five if you're already 15 and you're
trying to just milk milk milk
then you're just going to accumulate all
fatigue at very some maximal uh volumes
anyway you might not do the best job
so i think there's a middle ground there
i would say my best guess as a
practitioner is between four and eight
weeks of accumulation for intermediates
is the best um and uh you will notice
you will notice
that if you try to design a program
that's uh shorter than four weeks but
especially longer than eight weeks
you're gonna have to fudge some
variables on the short end
you're going to have to accelerate way
faster than your k than than you're
comfortable with
soreness is going to be crazy and the
risk of injury is going to be really
high you're like no
how many how many leg press sets do i
have to do this week fuck if i just took
my time i could
ramp it up slower but you go 10 15 20.
can you imagine that shit fuck that
you'd be a disaster the whole time
whereas on the other end if you're like
oh i want to train for nine weeks and
you start working out the math how many
sets you can do each week you're like
god damn it the first three weeks are
fucking waste of time
and you'll know this so generally
speaking anyone i'll make a more
concrete
claim anyone who is deloading more often
than once every three weeks uh once
every four weeks
and less often than once every eight
weeks as an intermediate i question
whether they're trading
appropriate levels of volume and
intensity for an optimum program that's
it
yeah excellent feedback um one thing i
think that that i forgot the person's
name already sorry in advance
uh lucio i think where you kind of
missed the mark on this first question
was assuming
that training an mev is not optimal
right for the first week training at mev
is optimal right could you train a
little bit more sure
but the fatigue to uh like time cost
that you pay for that
ends up not being optimal on the more
chronic scale so acutely it might be
maybe an advantage to doing it that way
training on med excuse me mav week one
but then when you look at how long
you're going to be accumulating fatigue
and what happens in the latter weeks
it's probably not a good trade-off um
what i have found and i'm not trying to
pick pick numbers here and debate dr
mike because i completely agree with
what dr mike said
my anecdote the people that i've worked
with who i would consider
intermediates generally cannot do more
than five to six weeks
if you are really training them hard no
i don't i'm not debating the numbers
saying like eight weeks
that's not the point my point is i would
say more often than not they would fall
within the five to six week
category and if it's more than that
usually it's because they're either um
very slow twitch
female or both and that's just how it
goes uh but for like intermediate males
who are kind
like if i would just say somebody like
myself maybe somewhere in the middle not
slow twitch not fast switch
five six weeks is where you're gonna
land more often than not um there was
another point i had in this but i kind
of forgot
oh yes so he makes the interesting point
of like
the the difference between mav training
and the mrv training
is a substantial amount of effort but
not a huge amount of payout necessarily
and in the case of physique training
that payout is probably worth the fuss
but in other instances and of course i'm
usually more of the sports guy if you're
doing sport
training you could make a very strong
case to say mav
training for your resistance training
portion of your program is probably the
most economical choice because you have
to have enough room to do your other
things your conditioning
your sport by definition not trying to
engage optimally
exactly because you have other things
going on right and so that's a very
strong case for training at mav and not
mrv
but if you're only doing resistance
training and maybe just enough cardio to
keep yourself healthy
i would still say trading to mrv is
probably the best bang for your buck
because you're going to deload anyway
and that d-load is going to happen at
the same relative
time because training at m8 once you go
past the mev window and move into mav
it's a time bomb until when the d-load
is going to need to happen either way so
you might as well eke out the most games
just real quick uh james and i have
recently sort of
conceptualized mrv in a different way
that's
easier to understand mrv is when you can
no longer make gains in performance
which means the opposite is that if you
haven't hit mrv you can still make gains
in performance
so if you're telling somebody to deload
when they're at mev-ish before they hit
mrv
they're like so i added five pounds to
my bench last week and they got the same
rupture
and they're like i totally feel like i
could do that again next week you're
like nope it's time to de-load you're
like
okay that's a tough argument not just
psychologically but to yourself like
how long can the gains keep coming you
don't know like until you have a week we
were like that was hard i'm not gonna be
able to add five pounds
why would you stop now there are good
theoretical reasons but they're also
good theoretical reasons for just
not certain because a lot of us look at
real talk guys we've all been there
where we're like i can't do this and
then four weeks later we put 20 pounds
under our fucking squad like
i guess i could and you would just be
airing on the side of what you think is
conservative but you don't know how
conservative it is
because you're never pushing the limits
james and i are very uncomfortable
for folks that regularly plan on not
pushing the limit so what the fuck are
you training for
you might be way off the mark yeah and
that's an
awesome point and i just want to
differentiate so like what dr mike is
saying is different
from somebody who fucking puts their
headphones on
blasts metallica and hits like a zero ir
shit your pants all-time pr right where
they're like coach
i just pr on my squat and it's like
that's awesome
like how do you feel now like terrible
right like that's a deload situation
we're talking about somebody who's
doing normal training not unusual
amounts of arousal not unusual amounts
of rir and they just
keep making progress week to week that's
a case where you say yes
keep going clearly we can auto regulate
this a little bit you can extend your
mesolink out a little bit and we'll fix
it next time
versus someone who shits their pants to
hit a pr
and then they have no choice but to
deload because they got nothing left
is that it for this week it's not
remotely
what no we got more so oh
luke luccio actually has a party's
question oh and we have
another two people i think uh well i
thought you said we were already at 11
sorry
no no no my bad that was me uh fitting
in the nickels
oh sorry okay no i'm gay i just thought
we were done that's all
all right number two i'm a former
gymnast and one thing that i see
perpetuating gymnastics world and i
shouldn't get too big
even the specific muscles that intervene
when the movements they need to perform
shoulders back biceps for example
so most of the gymnasts uh train only
the one to five rep range getting really
strong but shortcoming their muscle
building potential
doesn't the strength potential of
building muscle in this area surpass the
strength needed
to lift the additional body weight gains
thus uh being actually beneficial to
gain some weight
if this case if this is the case how
much should gymnasts spend actually
building muscle
and they can get uh and can they
actually get too big for their own sake
uh thanks again and i hope this gets
seen and uploaded enough so we can all
learn great questions uh great question
so the the easy answer is
absolutely possible to get too big as a
gymnast uh power to weight strength
weight ratio is super fucking important
uh gymnasts are all relatively small for
a reason
so it's for sure possible to get too big
another thing is gymnasts do so much
sport specific work that is within the
hypertrophy
threshold that they get tons of
hypertrophy from doing no purpose versus
training at
all and then when they add sets of one
to five that usually fills in
all the hypertrophy they're ever going
to need there's there are some
situations which they can benefit from
targeted directed sets of five to ten
specifically perfectly trained sure but
those aren't saying the
mass minority because just doing
gymnastics practice and doing strength
work
gets you almost all the muscle you ever
need to be as a gymnast and i'll say one
more really really unfortunate thing
if you need much more perturbative
volume to get the muscularity of the
genius you probably don't have the
genetics to be really good at gymnastics
anyway
uh certainly at a high level because all
the very high level gymnasts they just
do gymnastics work in the damn near ifb
pro physique bodybuilders anyway and
then they do sets of one to five and
they're like
and then they really are have the
realistic problem of doing too much and
getting too big so
at the end of the day the two big part
isn't exactly how big a muscle is it's
how much you weigh
and uh if you add more five more pounds
ten more pounds to your weight you're
gonna find the events much more
difficult
and uh but you will have big deals so
james
yeah you nailed it my friend and just
keep in mind too
sometimes the k it might seem obvious
where you're like
well if my my pecs were a little bit
stronger and bigger
i could do the iron cross on the the
rings better right
but that extra peck weight might have a
downstream effect on your ability to do
you know your floor your pommel your and
your vault any of those other things
right so
it's a very very calculated move to try
and do hypertrophy for gymnastics
because
you have to deal with strength and power
to body weight ratio but you also have
to factor that in for the various
different events that you're doing not
just one
so it might be beneficial to one and
detrimental to the others and you might
have a net negative effect overall
from gaining weight whereas like on one
event it might be great and others it
might be bad and vice versa so
it's um it's a complicated question and
it's only something that
you as an athlete and having a really
good relationship with a coach and a
sports scientist
can make that kind of calculated
decision so like mike and i can't answer
that for you because we just don't know
we would there's no way for us to know
how the athlete is performing on some
uh movements and versus others and which
where they're really lacking so this is
where having a really
thorough and robust needs analysis and
monitoring program
can make all the difference in the world
where you can get
a much clearer or at least a much more
focused answer to these types of
questions rather than like i don't know
maybe you should do some more curls
let us scroll down to second to last
question jason
merritt
i hope this is a meritorious type
question well funny enough
his first sentences can't you discuss
the merits
oh shameless jason
you got your own name in there he's
gonna he's gonna have some wicked dad
pun someday
can you discuss the merits for against
bella's training uh squats and deadlifts
for hypertrophy
i understand that a belt allows for
heavier weights to be lifted while
battleless training elicits more
stabilization
is bentless training only beneficial for
the core uh question mark so
actually we're gonna have a video
eventually um on this specifically
breaking everything down but it's
actually a really simple answer
um training beltless
in the swats and deadlifts for example
gives you a higher stimulus to fatigue
ratio for your core
because you have to lift less weight but
your core has to be just as active
if you train with a belt on
then it doesn't improve your stimulus to
fatigue ratio for your quads and your
back or whatever you're training with
squats and deadlifts but it improves
your raw stimulus magnitude
you can fuck those up muscles up more
because the core is less inhibitory as a
like a problem link in the chain so
training boutless it's the best idea
let's get intermediate so beginner
should all be about this anyway to learn
technique proper racing blah blah but
for intermediates and advanced beltless
training
should be done if you feel it's more
comfortable uh and or if you're really
trying to
you know get the core going um
especially in a sports specific
situation where you would need
to be exhibiting your strength
doubtlessly uh if you
want to lift as much weight as possible
and thus for sure
get your periphery stronger whatever
targets you have legs and back
put on a belt and also because you put
more weight on the bar when you have a
belt
with training with a belt probably
change your core just as much as
training without it as
long as you also lift the appropriate
rar and put more weight on the bar
when you're training with a belt so
that's the pretty simple answer
yeah that was really good and some
people are really responsive to the belt
meaning like their numbers go
up like very profoundly and i don't want
to say that like it's a performance
improvement
but they they have a tangible difference
in belt training
and so one of the things that you'll
you'll problems that you run into
is if they're used to training mostly
beltless which isn't good or bad
when they put the belt on they see like
really big bumps in their
uh the weights that they can lift
sometimes they can overshoot their
systemic fatigue limitations just
because there's more weight on the bar
and just has a bigger systemic load that
they have to deal with
and so one of the things that you can do
is use beltless training and
as like kind of pre-programmed lighter
sessions where you're trying to not
necessarily accumulate a ton of systemic
fatigue but you don't want to
deviate from some of your main kind of
compound lifts and this is this is
definitely more of a sporting
kind of example you wouldn't see this
problem in physique training necessarily
but you might have somebody who's like a
rugby player and you might have like a
lighter quad day planned
you could do belted high bar squats or
you could do some like beltless
front squats which will take the load
down substantially but they'll still get
plenty good stimulus in the quads uh and
it won't have this
as much systemic spillover
into their other rugby activities their
cardio etc so
that could be like a pre-programmed
light light session type strategy if you
wanted to use it that way
um all right all the way third from
bottom
is nicolas luca ricardielli
god damn see he had 12 up votes why is
he so far
down see what the fuck right yeah i
agree
and three replies which i don't know
right that should have bumped him way up
yeah all right
so he says
what exactly is it about calorie balance
that as soon as you're not on a surplus
you can't
gain overhead pressing strength and if
anything you start losing
why does it affect doesn't it affect the
other lifts
um i think that uh so you're on to
something it totally affects the other
lifts so specifically all pressing
gets way better when you've gained
weight or gaining weight um then you're
losing weight you're pressing tends to
go down
um so we can ask why squatting doesn't
another way usually like your squat will
go up somewhat
uh but it it maybe not go down when
you're go up somewhere with a
surplus but when your deficit might not
go down similar things sometimes for
deadlifts so it's actually relatively
easy to answer
um surplus really just improves
everything
okay it improves pressing a little bit
more because sometimes
it really just improves your leverages
like you don't have to send the bar as
much there's more padding around you
so you can use your fat for lack of a
better term these stay tighter at the
bottom for example and there's a bit of
a spring rebound effect
so that's definitely a thing that
happens but here's the other thing
when you lose weight squatting involves
lifting your own weight
pressing does not so when you lose
weight
you might have gotten considerably
weaker in the quadriceps but because
you're also lighter
there's no detection of that you're like
oh my squat didn't go down like
technically it did if you count your
entire body mass system that you're
moving shake
and above plus weight uh so a lot of
times your leg press will go down on a
cup with your squat wound you're like
what gives
and there's another one uh endurance
your endurance always goes up when you
get leaner almost always and squatting
for reps is a fucking endurance ass
activity pressing for up's not nearly as
much right
so there's definitely a benefit there a
lot of times your squat for reps will go
up
when you lose fat but your max squat
might go down or something like that so
there's that
and then for deadlift it's same
endurance thing same body weight thing
but also another thing is leverage
a lot of times uh your deadlift
leverages go straight to fucking hell
when you put on a lot of weight
which is like so but your deadlift goes
up too but then ends up being like they
sort of cancel each other out you may
gain 30 pounds
and your deadlift might only go up 10
and look what the fuck right
but then you lose some of that weight
your death of skyrockets as you get
leaner because you can get in a better
position because like having a big gut
just you draw out a free body diagram
fucks you in the ass
so bad for deadlifting which is why
almost no fat guys can dead look well
it's and almost because uh
uh what's his name eddie hall right
that's it you're not eddie hall
but having a big gut might actually help
keep you more stable in that overhead
press position am i right
oh my god if you got like a big z body
of course you're gonna be able to
overhead press i'm just kidding he
doesn't have like a big but he's just a
big
fucking hunk of man yeah
um this is a funny question i really
have much to contribute after what dr
mike said um
but i think what you're experiencing is
more just kind of uh fitness fatigue
relationships with
pressing like overhead pressing in
particular is very systemically
fatiguing and thus
and it's also uh the technique is going
to be really sensitive to that because
you're having to press the thing
over your head it's going to cause that
wave effect throughout your body
fatigue is going to have a huge impact
on that so when fatigue conditions
improve
and that's just from being in a calorie
surplus your preparedness to express
things like technique and stability will
just go up
and something like that is just
naturally going to feel better i don't
really have much after that
boom right that's it j mo that's all
type of questions
oh man we had some spicy names we had
some actually
we i always say this i always say like
it's a surprise but this week in
particular i really enjoyed the
questions there was a bunch that kind of
tickled my fancy in particular
especially things that are regarding
strength to power
body weight ratio those kind of
questions i really like so really really
good stuff folks really really good
thanks for engaging with us
i had fun dr mike did you enjoy tons
great questions hopefully the great
questions will continue
folks vote vote vote vote up vote the
questions you like because yours
might every time you submit a question
it's a few other questions that you
think
could do well and if everyone does that
on the net balance we'll get as many
questions answered that are relevant to
the most number of people
i thought you were going political for a
second i was like oh no
you don't know economics really well
don't vote
um yes is there any cool videos that
people should keep their eye out for
coming up
uh always man we've got let's see what's
on the agenda i'm not sure how
our video guy is releasing these exactly
but let's see a little preview i'm gonna
scroll up here
um we've got we just
released um
uh how many exercises per muscle
we're going to have how can i get better
at gauging rir soon is periodization for
muscle growth important
how to get and stay motivated to lose
fat how to get and stay motivated to
train
uh and then we've got uh how to design
your d-load after de-learning how to
build your next plan technique relative
effort trade-offs
uh addressing quality first and quantity
how long should my workouts be
folks a lot of shit coming up
i want to see scott hoon natty or not
or that's our video guy by the way guys
uh
maybe we're gonna we're gonna be making
some more uh natalie or not spoof videos
so stay tuned for those
all right well folks we appreciate you
guys engaging with us we had a great
time every week
make sure you guys subscribe to the rp
youtube channel to get all of our
banter but additionally all the other
cool videos that are coming out
and we'll see you soon boom
