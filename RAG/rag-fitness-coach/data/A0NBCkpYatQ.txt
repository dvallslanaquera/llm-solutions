hey folks it's me Dr Mike for
Renaissance periodization and
you asked for it it's here the bench
press guide for hypertrophy hyperfectry
I perfect some people do really struggle
with that word and um
I don't struggle with words I'm quite
verbose but I do struggle with
definitely my sexuality I Scott the
video guy just pointed out
I'm addicted to
adult films
I just picked up smoking as a habit
um
this is really hard to say just
I'll just say it
I have a nasty habit
of picking up
truck drivers and truck stops
and like
you guys ever see that where the hyenas
get like one of the deer limbs off and
they just eight of them are pulling it
into that's me at a truck stop I'm the
deer Lim
it feels so good they don't tell you
that in sex ed class when they're like
respect your body but what if disrespect
is the thing that turns me on I want to
be a piece of meat in the wind in any
case why did you click on this video it
was to see bench press tips to make sure
your pecs grow better so let's get the
fuck into that
and I should just never say anything
outside of exercise ever again tip
number one
here we go
[Music]
okay so the first tip in the bench press
to hit the PEX better is to Arch the
back not a ton just a little bit works
take your scapulae and retract them what
that does is it brings your sternal pecs
into play and puts you in a real power
position for the chest and it also by
retracting the scapulae pre-stretches
the chest so that when you're down here
it's way less shoulders way less
shoulder joint and pre-stretch pecs
means your chance for muscle growth
induction is just much higher a lot of
people who
bench flat backed and with their
shoulders flared out that's like the
football program and high school bench
press they're the ones that are like
yeah man I used to bench my shoulders
got the better of me I was a competitive
poweller for years don't worry don't
bother Googling it I was never very
strong and I benched for my entire
powerlifting career and other than in
high school before I was a powerlifter
before I learned how Archer attract I've
never one single time hurt my shoulder
in the bench press ever
so how you would do this in real life is
you would get down onto a bench which I
will demonstrate
gladly for YouTube
first thing you do
is you walk your scapulae towards your
butt this arches your back again you
don't have to have crazy Arch just a
little bit and as you walk them back you
also walk them in it's going to take a
couple walks really tuck them in there
and then you'll grab the bar notice the
bar is going to lay pretty low if you
reach up you lose all that shit so you
should set the bar low
grab the shit
hopefully you can get a spotter to help
you
unrack push the bar over to the position
and then sometimes especially if you're
doing higher repetitions what you want
to do is kind of tuck it again a little
bit to reinforce that pattern as the bar
descends you keep your chest stuck way
in the air and you press
and way in the air and then you press
and while I'm down here let's just knock
out tip number two so tip one is Archer
retract
tip number two is to take a pause at the
chest
especially with slow eccentric control a
pause at the chest to make sure you
really milk out
the unbelievable amount of tension
through your stretched pecs that will
help you grow a ton so you hear your
chest is stuck out you bring down just
to around your nipple line pause not
caving over
chest still big everything's stretched
this will not feel good this pause does
not feel like a rest it feels like holy
shit my pecs are going to blow up and
then press to a full lockout chest up
and pause and press as you do more reps
you'll get tempted to collapse and Cave
over so remind yourself to keep your
scapulae tucked reach your pecs out to
touch and press reach your pecs out to
touch pause and press just like that
[Music]
next tip hand position
what you want out of your hand position
is for your wrists to feel good
your elbows to feel good your shoulders
to feel good
and also for you to get a nice gnarly
deep stretch in your pecs and feel the
movement in your pecs
Some People based on their build will
have a relatively close grip and that's
how they'll feel chess the most
some people can even do a very wide grip
and that's how they feel chess the most
other people if they try wide grip it
just kind of feels like a ton of pain in
their shoulders nothing else is
happening so with your grip play around
to find out what's best for you start
with just outside of shoulder width grip
try one fist length out you guys are
used to fist lengths I'm sure so fist
length is like here and here now we're
out here fist length in is here another
fist length then is here so on and so
forth play with this Links at first
if one of them feels almost good you're
like you know this feels great
this feels a little bit worse but this
doesn't feel ideal
play with finger links instead between
those two you will find a really really
good pressing point the way you can tell
again is all of your joints feel great
and your pecs are getting torn to shreds
at the bottom that's how you find hand
grip and again there's not one right
answer it could be multiple answers you
can say oh I like the wide variant that
feels great it also feels a different
kind of great to go a little closer no
wrong answers just make sure you're
paying attention to those cues if your
joints feel good and your muscles feel
like they're getting really really
fucked up
[Music]
what to do about elbow flare
a couple things to say about this
some people will bench press Guillotine
style where they take a higher position
on the chest and they'll let their
elbows come up they feel a huge stretch
in the pecs their shoulders feel amazing
no problem correct answer
other folks will touch a little bit
below the nipple line actually on their
abdomen and they will tuck their elbows
on the way down you'll see this from
shirted pressing back in the day from
equipped power lifting
if that is what hits your pecs the most
and it makes your elbows and shoulders
feel nice and comfy and safe
beautiful
right answer
what I don't want you guys to get caught
up in is people on the internet who say
this is bad because biomechanics
I don't know where the fuck they say
that because if you go out here notice
my packs are getting more stretched as I
pull out there's lots of people saying
you got to tuck in the elbows to do more
chest that's fucking backwards if you
tuck in the elbows the line of pull
aligns better with the front delts and
it's more triceps front delts and
triceps is more like tucked The Wider
you go all the way up till here is more
pecs however not everyone can handle
wide and it can fuck your shoulders up
my best recommendation for you is this
don't worry about where your elbows go
at all
set up a comfortable hand position
Archer retract
focus on your chest
your elbows will naturally position
themselves
to a point that is easy on your joints
and hard on your muscles
if it takes a little bit of finagling by
all means do it so if you do naturally
and you're like I don't know my
shoulders feel kind of mad try a little
bit more in just a tad
all shoulders feel great even more in
shoulders feel amazing but I don't feel
my chest Much Anymore boom you found it
that's the right answer but if you want
a flare no problem at all as long as you
gently pause there is a very minimum
risk of injury yes if you're crashing
down with a trillion pounds and you're
not pausing and you're using sets of
four or five benching like this will
fuck you up but then benching like this
will probably fuck you up too just in a
different way
be measured
feel your body out
start with a natural elbow angle adjust
a little bit see how it affects your
shoulders your elbows Etc
back
10 years ago
when I was geez already on my way to
getting a PhD it was in a PhD program
I
thought there was correct technique that
was basically identical for everyone
and then I fucking took one of our balls
out and hit it with a hammer to punish
myself because that was fucking stupid
because everyone's built a little bit
differently some people are built a lot
differently different ratios of lower
and upper arm lengths different
intracromial widths different shapes
subtly of pecs and shoulders and triceps
different slight variations in design of
the shoulder joint so that if you tell
people everyone should do this or
everyone should do this it's out of the
gate fucking wrong
it could have a grain of Truth it could
have a lot of truth to it but don't just
be like oh this is optimal but my
shoulders hurt I don't feel my chest but
this is optimal because biomechanics
fuck all that noise start with the
basics play around with some variations
your body will find the right thing for
you to do and if it doesn't I guess your
body's just fucking stupid and wrong I'm
kidding I hope all right last tip coming
up
[Music]
last tip for the day for getting a lot
out of chest growth in the bench press
is to make sure that you are controlling
the eccentric
this will bring you no love
and how much you can bench for reps but
so if you want hypertrophy you don't
care
slow eccentric does not mean five
seconds or 10.
but it means you don't dump the bar on
your chest
it means that you take a few seconds
to really lower and while you're
lowering I want you to think of reaching
your chest up while having the fibers
pulled apart
that sensation of the fibers pulling
apart as you reach up is not something
you should try to avoid
and I know that sounds weird because
normally in real life if your shit is
getting pulled apart you're like I
shouldn't be here I should get out I
should Rush this
remember you're here to get them pull
apart because that's what stimulates
growth so you're going to reach up the
whole time and your chest is going to be
pulled apart pause gently press
big reach big chest slow and up and as
you reach close to failure don't start
going faster it is not a rep counting
competition
from week one in your mesocycle big
chest slow gentle touch and up on the
way up go fast fuck yeah produce some
Force
slow lock slow lock control lock notice
it's not super slow
this is a perfectly fine Cadence
and it will fuck your chest
into some planet of the solar system now
which planet
Mars
Neptune no that was a production company
back in the early 2000s
what's up Pharrell
Uranus
I'm sure you have one folks thanks for
tuning in sorry for all the derogatories
featured earlier I don't know what
happened to me I'll see you next time
for more exercise instructions learning
about exercise science Sports Science
and more of my perversions see you next
time
