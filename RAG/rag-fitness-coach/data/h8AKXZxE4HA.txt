training your obliques will just make
your obliques bigger and if you're very
lean it'll make your abs seem wider and
really have your obliques hang in there
it doesn't do the the part of the
 muscle that the girls seem to
like the Brad Pit muscle that's just
your whole rectus abdominus musculature
you mostly train that through
conventional app moves and mostly is a
matter of genetics and how lean you get
to how much you see that so none of that
is going to help you with this and if
you want bigger obliques I'm just not
sure why most people want a narrow waist
to make their back look bigger and their
legs look bigger and have more of that V
taper and X frame so yeah don't train
your obliques it's a waste of
your time
