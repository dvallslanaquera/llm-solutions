hey folks
doctor mike kiltel here for renaissance
periodization we are at the
lions den somewhere in pennsylvania
joey sat mary's gym it's a
incredible place
tons of strong man stuff tons of
everything check it out but we're not
here just to check it out
we're here to give you the exclusive on
overhead tricep extension
tips tricks and common mistakes even you
could be making
and have no idea so let's get into it
with mistake number one
all right folks mistake number one is
cutting the range of motion way too much
remember stretch under tension is an
independent cause of hypertrophy
and also going through a full range of
motion probably simulates more
higher percentage of muscle fibers and
it ends up causing us
more growth so how does this look in
real life well it happens a ton go ahead
crystal uh up and over and you know you
start with all super good intentions
maybe not
and you cut the rom at some arbitrary
point you know maybe when it feels heavy
no likes to no one likes to go lower
than that
i'll go ahead and come up so you know
one more time just for the audience
there yeah
and you know that looks like sort of an
exercise except what has to happen go
ahead and drop it
is you have to use whatever rep range
you want you have to use more weight to
hit it
so let's say you're working with a five
to ten rep range you have to use a bunch
more weight because
you're artificially restricting range of
motion we're not here to impress people
we're here to get muscle growth
so the number one solution to this
problem is just the realization okay i
have to go lower
and a lot of times what that means is
two things one is making sure that you
take weight off the bar to get back into
your normal rep range
and two sometimes there's some grip
adjustment because whatever grip you
could have taken and we'll cover grip a
little bit later
might not be comfortable to go super low
so find a comfy grip just by exploration
just by trying it
that's okay to go low with and then give
it a shot so give us this fix real quick
let's say we adjusted weight on the bar
how low should we be going well until
our uh forearms
touch all the way down and we can't go
any lower notice her elbows are bent
nice and forward and then she's gonna
come all the way up
yep and then all the way back down slow
and controlled
just like that full range is when you
can't go any lower and you're pain-free
perfect all right mistake number two not
nearly as common but you can take the
range of motion thing from mistake
number one
a little bit too far and say okay the
lower i go the better you end up going
so low that one of two things happened
one you no longer really feel it in your
target muscle the triceps you might
start to feel the joints more
and two you might actually experience
pain in any of the connective tissues or
any involved areas
that's not like oh this is a fine pain
it's a pain that gets worse and worse
and feels
directly in the joint that's not
something you want to do over and over
so
on your way to full range of motion you
might do one of these things where you
know you have all the best intentions
you're going to go all the way down and
then you're going to go super deep and
depending on your body structure
whatever you try to get
credit you're in pain your shoulder
hurts stinks go ahead and come back up
what do you do to fix it it's an easy
fix find the biggest range of motion you
can do
without pain in the joints and
connective tissues and you're fine now
remember
if your tricep tendons feel like they're
being pulled apart painfully at the
bottom that's a good thing
that's okay normally it's not a problem
but if you feel pain directly in the
elbow joint itself
in the shoulder joint and it gets worse
with rapid rep and sentence set
probably not a good idea so the fix here
is to find where
the pain is essentially non-existent in
that sort of really bad way
and then okay you're good here and then
you come back up and that's it and that
reliably produces really good growth
with very few downsides
all right so next mistake is to not
control
the descent this happens a lot when
people get into the idea of reps are the
only thing that matters i just want to
get through the reps
i don't want to have to control the
weight because if i just get through the
reps and drop get through the reps drop
get through the reps strap
i'll have the wraps i want we're not
here to do reps reps are a reflection
a side effect of us providing adequate
hypertrophy stimulus
they're the measuring stick okay just
like you wouldn't say okay i want to be
six feet tall
okay got it i'm six feet right well for
me that would be five eight or something
if i got on my toes
you don't you know you're lying to
yourself right so you want the reps to
be good
first and then you want to be concerned
with how many you're getting over time
so here's the mistake visualized for us
all the best intentions again and then
oop it just comes down and bloop
just comes down on the way up it's
totally fine but on the way down it's
too fast
the muscles are not active remember the
eccentric component
lowering under control produces lots of
hypertrophic stimulus
and by not bouncing out of the hole
we're actually increasing the safety of
the exercise so
give us a look at what that's really
look like you don't have to go slowly
centric though you can
but at least one or two seconds full
control
probably a gentle pause at the bottom is
a really really good idea
just like that
the next mistake is letting the elbows
flare out too much
on the way down or even on the way up
elbow flare
isn't a totally big problem because you
still activate your triceps a ton
doesn't matter which way they're flared
however a lot of people the reason they
flare
is because it allows them to bring their
upper pecs into the movement more
or even their front delts into the
movement more it turns into more of a
press
at that point your triceps aren't
getting as high of a percentage of the
exposure for the tension
and it ends up being that the stimulus
to fatigue ratio one of our earlier
videos
which we'll link for you isn't as high
all right so what we want to do is
ideally
keep the elbows together pointed as
forward as possible
so long as it doesn't hurt our joints on
the way down
on the way up yeah keep them forward but
just concentrate on pressing the weight
and everything is going to take care of
itself notice there is no magic amount
of elbow bend
that decides for you how much joint
discomfort you have
versus tricep activity versus front delt
activity so find an elbow bend that for
you
hits your triceps up like crazy doesn't
bother your shoulder
elbow joints a ton and keeps your front
delts out of the movement enough
to make sure your triceps are getting
hit hard if that elbow angle works for
you is best out here that's totally fine
just don't be out here if this hits your
triceps even more it doesn't
hurt your shoulders let's give a shot to
what that looks like so the bad way
is of course elbow flare is when you're
doing this kind of stuff it also
sometimes feels weird but some people
can lift more like that lifting more is
not the point
lifting more with good technique is the
point so the fix here sometimes requires
weight reduction is to be diligent
push the elbows in on the way down the
elbows are going to be pointed more or
less
forward right in front of you doing
these in front of a mirror
can be a big help it's not required but
it's a really good idea good enough
crystal
the biggest benefit about doing these in
front of a mirror is not
actually checking your technique and
making sure it's right down that's
really important
what's important is that you look at
yourself as much as possible because you
love yourself
and any time spent looking at yourself
is a great time
next mistake is not reaching back far
enough now here's the deal
a lot of times people will let their
elbows slide really far forward
on the overhead extension because it
allows them to use their front delts
more
it leverages their triceps better which
is not exactly what we want
it ends up letting you lift more weight
and consequently the stimulus to fatigue
ratio
over all this exercise to the triceps
just isn't as good
ideally you want your upper arm to stay
as close to vertical as possible
and reaching back now you might not be
flexible enough for this
or it might hurt your shoulders or it
might not really feel that great for
your triceps
yes reaching overhead hits the long head
a ton but
another interesting thing a lot of
people don't talk about is every time
you do any kind of pulling especially
overhead vertical pulling pull ups pull
down and so on and so forth
that hits your long head a ton probably
takes care of it just fine
from a hypertrophy perspective so if you
only ever do vertical and horizontal
pulling and all you do is skull crushers
and dips which don't hit that long head
that much
you probably have a super well developed
long head so don't over emphasize that
stuff
what i will say is this to the extent
that you can keep your elbows in and
reach
back as opposed to down do it until and
unless you don't have the flexibility or
it feels painful for you
or it doesn't seem to hit your triceps
hard enough with all the stimulus to
fatigue ratio stuff on the stimulus side
that we talk about pump disruption and
so on and so forth so
let's take a look at what this looks
like in real life here we go
mistake the wrong way to do it you end
up
leaning forward a lot and you end up
kind of doing like an overhead
press basically right what you want to
do ideally is not have the elbows drift
down as much
have them stay relatively stable notice
how she's reaching back
that pulls on the long head here and
does a really good job of stimulating it
if
and to the extent that you can do this
it's probably a good idea
don't worry about keeping your elbows
completely vertical
that's extra credit and it doesn't
really add much of anything
so make sure it's all in balance at the
end of the day if your joints don't hurt
if the primary muscles being super
fatigued and hit from this are the
triceps
you're winning next mistake
is not having a standardized range of
motion standardized range of motion
helps us do at least two things one
it makes sure that because we have a
good standard it's objectively better
that every single rep is good if you
know what an a plus is on a test
you can get an a plus just the same way
if you know going all the way down with
your elbows in
that range of motion is ideal for
hypertrophy you can just replicate it
every time and not worry was that a good
rep
but secondly it's a tracking problem
even if you do partials
to here you probably want to keep doing
partials to know if you're getting
stronger
so you can track your mrv and all of
your volume landmarks how much training
is
effective and seeing how you can
manipulate that over time
for example if you you know sometimes go
this
low and sometimes go this low and
someone's like hey your triceps getting
stronger for reps which is hugely
critical to figuring out if you're
growing muscle
you may not be able to answer that
question like well i hit a pr of 200
pounds
for 10 and someone's like how low was
that you're like well
cut it a little high you don't ever want
to get into that game so what you don't
want to happen
is this right here inconsistent reps
first rep looks great all the way down
second rep
you know let's go a little bit and then
third reps real high and then maybe you
feel bad about it you go all the way
down again how many reps was that who
knows the right way to do it is to do
every single rep
identically to the extent that you're
able to still provide high tension for
the muscle
so don't overdo the technique and just
think only technique and let your
muscular activation go down
try hard but make sure every rep hits
the benchmarks
which is easy if you're doing full range
of motion when
your forearm touches your bicep and you
feel a lot of
stretch on your tricep that's it that's
the end of the rep go ahead and show us
what that looks like
so there's no guessing game here there's
no below parallel there's no judging
all the way down and all the way up
every single time and you know you're
doing a good job that's it
this next mistake is a super simple one
you'll see made with almost every
exercise
body english cheating momentum call it
whatever you want it's a way of
using muscles that have nothing to do
with the target muscle
to do what lift more weight well that's
nice but the target muscle gets no more
stimulation
sometimes less and the systemic fatigue
accumulation is
massive we don't want this to happen we
don't want to turn
the tricep extension into a push press
which a lot of people do
yeah use your legs more crystal you're
doing great you're getting a check
plus on how much you can overhead extend
who knows what's going on anymore
folks this is not a good idea it
accomplishes nothing that we want
strictness isn't just some nerd
like oh your elbows are
you know too far out that doesn't count
it's to get us the stimulus we want
at the lowest fatigue possible when you
go to failure on this and you will if
you're training hard every now and again
it should be because your triceps
stopped not because your whole body gave
out because you can't use your legs
anymore
only use your upper body go ahead and
hit it
even if you get close to failure okay so
crystal i want you to pretend this next
rep is almost at failure
push well that was shitty pretending
pretend this next rep is almost a
failure really slow
slow slow notice how her technique is
still good there's nothing going on down
there perfect
you don't ever want to make sure that
you have a questionable rep
you don't want to say okay did that rep
count or did i just push it a little
why are you even getting that rep the
reps purpose is to hit the tricep
are you feeling the tricep yes leave
everything else alone
all right folks next if you take the
anti-cheating mantra
to beyond its logical extension which
some folks do
you get into this thing where strictness
becomes a religion instead of just a
good idea
and you say oh man you know you're not
being super strict anymore i see some
momentum i see some body movement
some body movement and adjustment is
completely natural remember when the
weight moves
especially in the sagittal plane your
center of mass center of gravity shifts
the rest of your body has to shift to
accommodate it so crystal go ahead and
show us what it looks like some people
say okay only look forward i don't know
why
reach really far back and all of a
sudden at the bottom when the bar is
back there
well you have to adjust because you're
starting to fall backwards it's
physically impossible
to completely keep your body rigid and
do
any kind of actual force production with
a moving object so
the right way to do this is look if you
have to dip your head below
it's totally fine and notice when she
presses up she moves back
when she comes down she moves forward a
little bit that's totally cool
as long as you're using that as an
adjustment for what feels best in your
tricep and as your body naturally moves
versus doing it on purpose to try to
generate momentum
next mistake is having hand grips that
are either too wide
or too narrow for your body structure
there is no correct answer here you just
have to pick a grip that's comfortable
for you
allows a high range of motion doesn't
hurt your joints and
hits your triceps that after a number of
reps getting close to failure multiple
sets you get a pump
tension all that good stuff if you're
like man that grip was great but i feel
my front delts a lot my triceps meh
it's not that great of a grip so
sometimes people try way too wide of a
grip
go ahead and you know they saw it on a
video somewhere someone says grab the
outer handles
well gee you know she's not that wide
shoulder that's a small frame this for
her some kind of weird exercise
it feels bad it's all off right so what
if you try way too close of a grip
you can just go ahead and switch grips
right here let's say she saw some
fitness influencer
and they're like this is how you build
triceps which for them might work
and for her it might hurt her wrists at
the bottom it might hurt her elbows
something's off she's going to pick a
grip not
a grip in the middle necessarily but a
grip
somewhere by experimenting which fits
her best all right so maybe with this
intermediate grip she's got a technique
that really really works well for her
good enough perfect the answer here
isn't
that too wide is bad it's not that too
narrow is bad
find your grip that stimulates the
triceps well
allows a good deal of range of motion
those two are very related by the way
and doesn't needlessly hurt your joints
in any meaningful way
next mistake is going either too heavy
or too light we have three main rep
ranges the 5 to 10 10 to 20 and 20 to
30.
the overhead tricep extension can be
done in every single one of those ranges
but
per individual that might not work so
well for some folks
doing the 5 to 10 range might be like
really painful for the shoulders it
might be if you're strong enough
difficult to get the bar up there
who the hell has a rack that can rack an
easy bar anyway
and it might not be like the triceps
don't feel a ton of tension or they do
but they don't get any pump it's just no
good for you
so try all three ranges but you might
find too heavy is not great
you might find that uh at the tail end
the 20 to 30 range just kind of makes
you really tired
sometimes people find the 20 30 range
that the supporting muscles end up
fatiguing first
you have trouble actually keeping your
shoulders elevated it becomes a front
delt endurance workout versus a tricep
workout so
my best recommendation is to do this
exercise in the 10 to 20 rep range on a
first set
but experiment with all the ranges to
find what's right for you and don't just
dogmatically say okay i gotta do this
heavy or i gotta do this super light
the last mistake is thinking
anything is a must do and ignoring the
actual stimulus to fatigue ratio
of your triceps remember the only point
of the overhead tricep extension
is to stimulate the triceps as much as
possible while
minimizing fatigue especially joint and
connective tissue fatigue so
there are no super golden rules here
find the range of motion
find the grip width find the elbow
position that works best
to stimulate your triceps a ton gets
them a ton of tension
at low rep ranges a ton of burn at high
rep ring yields a pump in a sense of
being disrupted in the actual target
muscle
and to make sure that the joint and
connective tissue pain and the systemic
fatigue you feel is as small as possible
you can do these seated you can do the
standing you can do them at an incline
etc etc etc just make sure you're being
honest with yourself
about which variation produces the most
stimulus and the least fatigue
modify as needed folks that's it for
