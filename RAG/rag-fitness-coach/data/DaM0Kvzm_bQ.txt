welcome to the house of hypertrophy
4 reps verse 8 reps verse 12 reps for
strength and hypertrophy
we're going to examine a recent study
from japan exploring this
we'll then detail how this study relates
to the rest of the scientific research
from which will derive highly useful rep
range conclusions for those after
strength hypertrophy or a combination of
the two
let's dive in
the researchers recruited 42 physically
active but not resistance trained men
later we'll discuss whether the
untrained status changes our
interpretations
subjects were assigned to one or four
groups a 4 8 12 or control group we
won't mention the control group any
further they did not train and
expectedly made no gains whatsoever
the three groups all trained the bench
press twice per week for 10 weeks
in the first two weeks all groups
trained the same and pretty easy
the first week involved three sets of
ten reps with a sixty percent one rep
max load per session
while the second week involved three
sets of eight reps with a seventy
percent one rep max load per session
i actually think this was a great thing
to do
it likely helped accustom the untrained
subjects to bench press form
in the third week the three groups
diverged in their training and this week
prepared the respective groups for their
actual regimen that started from the
fourth week onwards
specifically
the third week involved the full group
training with five sets of three
repetitions with a 90 or one rep max
load per session
the a group with three sets of six reps
with an eighty percent one rep max load
per session
and the twelve group with two sets of
ten reps with a seventy percent one rep
max load per session
from the fourth week until the end of
the study the four group trained with
seven sets or four reps with a ninety
percent one rep max load per session
the eight group with four sets of eight
repetitions with an eighty percent or
one rep max load per session
and the twelve group with three sets of
twelve reps with a seventy percent one
rep max load per session
all subjects rested three minutes
between sets which is a good strength of
this study
most studies tend to use short rests one
minute or shorter between sets
but we know with compound exercises
resting longer between sets tends to be
advantageous for hypertrophy and
strength
although three minutes of rest between
sets were used subjects weren't always
able to sustain their target rep numbers
across sets due to the relative loads
used for example someone in the 12 group
may have hit 12 reps on the first set
but only 10 or 9 in the second and third
sets
nevertheless as subjects improved and
managed to sustain their rep numbers
across sets so someone in the 12 group
managed to perform 12 reps in all three
sets loads were increased by 2.5 kg for
the next session
this ensured subjects kept training with
the relative loads they were supposed to
now
the reason the set numbers differed
between groups is as the researchers
wanted to equate volume load the product
of sets times reps times load between
all three groups
before and after the 12 weeks of
training
strength was assessed via bench press
one rep max whereas hypertrophy was
evaluated by pectoralis major volume
this is another strength of the study
volume is a 3d measure and takes into
consideration the whole of a muscle
many studies tend to only look at the
cross-sectional area or thickness of a
muscle and this is typically done in
only a single muscle region
it was found pectoralis major volume
increased similarly in all three
training groups
while bench press strength was similar
between the 4 and 8 group and both
greater than the 12 group
so this study suggests 4 8 and 12 reps
are comparable for hypertrophy while 12
reps are notably less effective for
strength than 4 and 8
[Music]
reps this study adds to the literature
indicating a wide range of rep ranges
are similarly effective for building
muscle
the literature indicates this applies to
both trained and untrained individuals
rep range simply aren't overly important
for hypertrophy the key is for you to
get to or close to failure with your
repetitions
which was done in the study just
overviewed
you probably want to get three or fewer
reps from failure this one's counter to
the popular traditional rep range
continuum which states 6 to 12 reps are
superior for building muscle
and is commonly seen in classic personal
training textbooks and social media
posts
now we know set numbers were not the
same between the three groups as the
researchers wanted to equate volume load
between them
some may be thinking this proves volume
load specifically is crucial and
correlated with muscle hypertrophy yet
i'm very skeptical of this
simply because as we explored in another
video numerous lines of evidence suggest
volume load precisely is not related to
gains
instead
a more accurate interpretation may be
that lower reps five or fewer are less
efficient for stimulating growth per set
so require more sets to compensate for
this and ultimately achieve similar
growth to more reps with fewer sets
i say this for two reasons
firstly the literature tends to suggest
when rep ranges are kept constant more
sets produce more hypertrophy up to a
point
so with a rep range less effective per
set it's logical performing additional
sets can be effective compensation
secondly
other research supports this
a 2016 study from new york had trained
men perform 3 sets per exercise a
session
and found muscle growth outcomes were
largely better when performing eight to
twelve reps to failure per set as
opposed to two to four reps to failure
per set
another 2014 study from new york found
performing seven sets of three reps to
failure was similarly effective for
hypertrophy outcomes
versus three sets of ten reps to failure
so five or fewer reps are likely less
effective per set for hypertrophy but
performing extra sets can adequately
compensate for this
i should also note that one or two reps
per set might not be effective for
hypertrophy at all we've examined this
evidence in another video
overall
reps between 6 and 35 are likely
similarly effective for hypertrophy per
set
for example
yet another 2015 study from new york
found in train to men performing three
sets per exercise a session
hypertrophy outcomes were similar
between training with 8 to 12
repetitions to failure and 25 to 35
repetitions to failure
some may be thinking hang on a minute
in the initial study we looked at didn't
the 8 group perform more sets than the
12 group
so if per set 6 to 35 reps are similar
and more sets tend to be better why
didn't the 8 group see more gains
my speculation is the set number
differences were not big enough
remember the 8 group just performed one
more set per session than the 12 group
summarizing this section a wide range of
rep ranges are similarly effective for
hypertrophy in untrained and trained
folks
per set
reps between 6 and 35 are likely
similarly effective
3 to 5 reps may be less efficient for
hypertrophy as it may require you to
perform extra sets
for those who care about time efficiency
this can be notable
here are the session durations from the
initial japanese study we assessed
the four groups spent nearly double the
time training the bench press per
session versus their 8 and 12 groups
recall bench press strength gains were
lowest for the 12 group in the study
this agrees with the rest of the
literature in that heavier loads and
thus lower repetitions are superior for
increasing one rep max strength
interestingly
the four and eight groups saw similar
strength gains
the fact subjects were untrained may be
relevant here
as there's potential evidence to believe
in more trained individuals four reps
would be superior to eight reps for
strength
for example we noted one study out of
new york comparing in trained
individuals three sets of two to four
reps to failure per exercise to three
sets of eight to twelve reps to failure
per exercise though we noted hypertrophy
outcomes were largely greater for the
eight to twelve reps strength gains on
the bench press and squat were actually
greater for the two to four rep group
so in total heavier load and lower rep
training five or fewer reps should
probably make up a large part of a
strength oriented program
another point i'd like to touch on is
the fact that initial japanese study
very interestingly looked at
correlations between bench press
strength gains and pectoralis major
growth
for both the four and eight groups there
was no correlation between them yet for
the 12 group there was indeed a
correlation between strength gains and
size gains
these findings are probably quite
logical
muscle size likely contributes to
strength as muscle growth achieved via
an increase in contractile components
increases your strength capacity
yet we also know adaptations in the
nervous system that result in your brain
and or spinal cord sending stronger
electrical signals to the muscle also
play a role in strength
heavier load training tends to stimulate
these nervous system adaptations more
thus
the lack of correlation between strength
and muscle in the four and eight groups
is probably because nervous system
adaptations clouded the effects of
hypertrophy on strength
whereas the 12 group probably
experienced fewer nervous system
adaptations perhaps explaining why we
were able to see a strength and size
correlation with them
i think this finding has a potentially
interesting implication
as an individual becomes more and more
trained and essentially maxes out
nervous system adaptations and other
non-hypertrophy related factors like
movement efficiency
muscle growth is one avenue by which you
can further increase strength
we know heavier load training five or
four reps can stimulate both nervous
system and hypertrophy adaptations
but given you've maxed the nervous
system adaptations you should be more
concerned about the hypertrophy aspect
however we know that five or four reps
may not be efficient for hypertrophy you
need extra sets
and because you've maxed out nervous
system adaptations and now only care
about hypertrophy
using higher reps can be viable in this
context for increasing your strength
efficiently
having said all of this a limitation is
i have no idea when nervous system
adaptations could max out
it's commonly believed the bulk of
nervous system adaptations occurs within
the first few months of heavy enough
training
and this may indeed be true
yet
there's still evidence of further
nervous system adaptations in
well-trained individuals
another problem is it's theoretically
possible someone maximizes or at least
practically maximizes their hypertrophy
before they even maximize nervous system
adaptations
overall more research is needed in this
area
at the very least the logic we've
overviewed probably demonstrates that
higher rep training in strength oriented
athletes can very well be justifiable
[Music]
based on the initial study overviewed
plus some other evidence we overviewed i
think it's reasonable to say
approximately that eight rep range is
highly efficient for concurrently
developing strength and muscle
it's not too heavy such that you have to
perform extra sets for hypertrophy but
it's still heavy enough to be great at
stimulating nervous system adaptations
for untrained individuals it might be
similarly effective to heavier loads for
stimulating these nervous system
adaptations while in more trained
individuals it may not be quite as good
but it still likely is respectably
effective
on top of this
there's some evidence that heavier low
training below five reps may not be the
most favorable for joint health in
select individuals for example one of
the aforementioned studies out of new
york reported that in two of ten
individuals training with 7 sets of 3
reps to failure per exercise
joint related injuries occurred
training around the 8 rep range may
limit this problem
[Music]
crystallizing everything
six to 35 reps are likely similarly
effective per set for stimulating
hypertrophy
training with three to five reps may
require you to perform extra sets to see
similar hypertrophy
for strength
heavier loads and lower reps five or
fewer reps tend to be better
particularly in trained individuals
finally the eight rep range zone is
likely highly efficient for concurrently
developing strength and muscle
