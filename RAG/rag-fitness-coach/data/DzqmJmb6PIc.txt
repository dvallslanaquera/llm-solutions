hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
in our bullshit series
here's the next video rapid weight loss
when you're trying to get long-term
results here we go
rapid weight loss is not always bad
first there's a small fraction of people
for whom rapid weight loss defined here
is greater than one percent of your
weight loss on average per week over
multiple weeks
actually results in a long term
sustained keeping the weight off and
staying healthy however
a very likely larger fraction of people
doesn't do well with that hardly at all
second
bodybuilders
use things like mini cuts intentionally
rapid super fast-paced weight loss
to engineer a purposeful rebound effect
back to an even higher body weight after
that's actually the one of the main
purposes of the mini cut is to rebound
you back into higher levels of body
weight by priming your hunger etc etc so
yes there are reasons to do rapid weight
loss but in most cases if your goal is
long-term weight loss getting down to a
healthy weight and keeping it off
rapid has some really really bad things
going for it
because it has bad things going for it
and because there's such a high chance
of that slingshot effect that yo-yo
effect you see my yo-yo
what do people do with their fingers
with your fucking yo-yo
yo-yos were cool
like when i arrived to america in 1991
they were really cool and i i think i
got one and i just was never athletic
enough to use it how's that for a low
athleticism
thanks jewish genetics in any case
people will yo-yo and when most people
try rapid
weight loss they do exactly what
bodybuilders do on purpose but by
accident they start at 200 pounds they
go down to 190 over the course of three
weeks
they get to a party they binge it's all
over and they're at 203 pounds a few
weeks later so
if
you want to rock it back up again ultra
rapid weight loss is a good idea if you
don't it might not be a good idea there
are other reasons why dieting it between
half a percent of your weight per week
and one percent is probably better for
most people for example if you weigh 200
pounds that's losing between one pound
and
two pounds
per week of body weight
that offers some really good advantages
first
it helps reduce crazy hunger and
cravings that much faster diets
absolutely encourage much more
it helps you avoid poor sleep if you cut
the deficit a ton your sleep goes to
hell that automatically means you start
losing muscle gaining fat all this crazy
stuff happens stress goes through the
roof it's all it's all that
you have ultra low energy with ultra
rapid diets that you don't get nearly
the same extent with a more easy paced
diet you can have trouble concentrating
at work or at school which is no good
because like that's really how you get
money and or education to be able to do
this crap anyway so if that's you know
shooting yourself on the foot that's a
really bad deal
and a lot of time
if you go ultra hard a super fast weight
loss diet it can sap you of your
motivation to keep going such that as
soon as the diet is over you're not like
all right i'm going to intelligently
select foods and count my macros and use
my rb diet coach app to get on
maintenance and follow the track and
never regain the weight you're much more
likely so fucking done with this shit
that you're like i don't give a fuck
anymore man i just suffered like crazy i
deserve
a bunch of junk food and voila you're
back up to your old weight
by
losing weight at a slower pace half a
percent or four percent per week as
opposed to a percent and higher for most
people is just better because it avoids
all those very very bad things
successful weight loss
is sustainable weight loss i'm going to
be completely clear straight up with you
guys
anytime someone says
i lost insert weight
in in short time frame i lost 50 pounds
in four months with the
dildo diet it's a great diet
honestly if i'm with you and i'm
chatting with you and you're a human
being
i'm going to be like that's awesome and
i'm i'm super happy for you
and then i'll probably thread into that
discussion like i'll talk about how
important maintenance is because that's
where most people fail a lot of people
can actually hack a diet but they
fucking just shoot back up
very few people can hack a diet to get
down to a weight
and then stay down there
and real talk if you're not a human
being and i just hear somewhere about
the fact that you lost a bunch of weight
people are proud of you i couldn't give
a flying fuck that shit does not impress
me and it shouldn't impress you why it's
the fraction of people that rebound back
depending on how you ask the question
from a research perspective
is something like one and four
to like
oh sorry rebound back up i said it the
other way
somewhere between three and four people
and nine and ten people come right back
up to their own body weight within
several weeks or months
of having lost the weight initially so
when people are like i lost 50 pounds
doing the whatever diet i'm not
impressed with that shit
much
i'm not impressed with the diet because
almost any diet that cuts calories can
get you to lose weight but if that diet
does so in a stupid fucking way it's way
too fast or it's way too restrictive it
builds zero habits for you to keep after
you're done dieting you're just going to
go back up like almost everyone else and
then what do you have was that there was
like a really cool fridge magnet i saw
once at a friend's house that said
uh i did a diet for a month and lost 30
days
30 days of great eating you could just
not fucking bother with that shit
could have just stayed off the diet
would have been the same wait two months
later but you lost weight for a month
came back up after a month and you're
just the same place you always were
except with one month extra misery and
with one month of disappointment in
yourself fuck all that right if you're
dieting to get the weight off for long
term you got to think a little bit more
calmly and slowly about what is the kind
of diet practice that's going to get me
to my destination but also let me chill
it's like going camping and eating all
your food that you plan for camping like
by the time you get to the site and
you're like i'm here people like how's
camping you're like it's over you got to
go back eat all the food it doesn't make
any fucking sense you got to think it
through a little bit more
which begs the question why do people do
rapid fat loss diets so often only to
balloon back up in most cases a couple
things first the old adage fools run in
where angels fear to tread
i always found this a very curious i
never looked in to the history of where
this uh statement came from but a couple
things always pop up in my head when i
hear this
are angels the
antithesis of fools i didn't know the
angels were like super intelligent i
just thought they were like
good or
had wings dressed in white had halos the
halos are really fucking sweet uh mostly
because dragon ball z had the halos so
uh yeah uh i guess you know without
digging into that statement an obsessive
amount
dumb people do dumb shit classic human
psychological observation it's a thing
right
and
there's a reason they do it because at
the at the end
you know someone says hey look like you
have to suffer dieting sucks you're like
okay
you can suffer for two months oh but
bear with me
you can suffer for four months
a lot of people are like it's gonna be
hard either way right and the person
even if they're truthful oh yeah they're
like fuck that let me get the quick one
but the problem is the quick one gets
the suffering over with faster but
probability of you ballooning back up
also goes up so it's a really big yin
and yang there right people think i'll
just get this over with quickly and be
done
and um
that logic has limits you know you don't
apply it to every other area of your
life
like you know you're not like oh yeah i
should leave for work at 11 but
i'll leave it uh 11 10 because i'll just
go 140 miles an hour down the freeway
i'll be over with real quick i hate
driving i might as well drive really
fast like
there's downsides with that like you can
crash kill yourself a whole bunch of
other people that's the thing you have
to think about in the dining world you
can crash hopefully you don't kill
anybody else unless they have an ice
cream cone you want and they're not
willing to give it to you
but uh yeah you can you know just give
yourself a huge pain in the ass and
regaining the weight
a lot of people that regain the weight
they end up being down on themselves and
their self-efficacy for future diets
drops which is to say that they're like
man i just i just don't work for me i'm
not that person a lot of people have
given up on their fitness because what
they think is fitness is this insane
psychotic clown diet which strips all
their nutrients away and makes them lose
a crapload of weight makes them ultra
hungry and they rebound just like well
if this is fitness i can't hack it but a
slower calmer more intelligent guided
approach
can result in amazing things they just
don't know about it or looked at it and
they're like man fuck that that's too
involved but here's the thing
if you really want to lose a bunch of
fat get healthier look better etc maybe
it's a serious goal to you and if it's
serious it requires a serious amount of
diligence right like if i work for some
advertising company
like hey like you gotta make some
billboard art for coca-cola hey coke
cool is probably a really big contract
you know i'm not gonna just put some
shit together in 20 minutes i'm gonna
think long and hard about that shit
because i want that contract money to
keep coming in it's a serious task it
requires me to think seriously be
patient and calm and do the right thing
for the long term no quick fixes quick
fixes in general just suck more the
benefit is that they're quick but where
the fuck are you rushing and that's my
kind of a really big question
is when people say
i want to lose this weight really quick
i i used to be a personal trainer for a
long time and people would come into the
gym and say hey like i only 200 pounds i
want to be 150. i want to get it off as
fast as possible and i was just stuck i
never said this to anyone but i just
wanted to be like
do you think you're to paraphrase uh
economist philosopher thomaso do you
think you're among the first million
people that have the idea that you
wanted its weight off immediately like
my wife says you know i wanted it off
yesterday but we don't have a fucking
time machine
don't be so audacious to think like i'll
just get off as quick as possible there
are trade-offs to that getting it off
really quick is possible but the
probability that it comes back on is now
much higher it is in your best interest
if you're very serious about losing the
fat and keeping it off to do it slow to
do it right to do it properly to take
breaks when needed etc
because some people instead
of engineering their lives to get
long-term results that last
fuck all that engineering they take
open little pouch and sprinkle a little
bullshit in
and that never tastes that good
see you guys next time
