again there's nowhere to run go
oh good you're in for the pain all in

[Music]
yo
i'm mike but you already probably know
that this is amanda
hello hello excellent amanda several
things a mom huh
a lawyer
stay calm
and a competitive power lifter
but she made a terrible mistake she
walked into renaissance gym
to
train back and shoulders which we talked
about earlier is not as bad as training
legs but pain will nonetheless
become her
excited
kind of good answer
excellent all right let's find out if
the giggles or the crying maybe both
let's go
[Music]
back workout only two exercises because
properly done that's probably all you
need for a single session
amanda's gonna start out with
assisted pull-ups
we'll do cable rows after i'll talk
about those then
assisted pull-ups can even be done if
you're strong enough to do regular
pull-ups
they change the technique of the
exercise in such a way you can usually
get a bigger range of motion and you can
slow the eccentric artificially and
because you're not so worried about
having to
try to get your own body out there
you know by any means necessary you can
focus a bit more on the mind muscle
connection and it really really pays so
what we're looking for here is to go all
the way up to the top big just at the
top
man is actually going to take a slight
pause for us and squeeze and then slow
controlled to a full stretch at the
bottom stretching out those lats and all
those other muscles sets of 10 to 20
reps gee probably about five sets here
we're going to fry her up let's get it
done i think
control it

[Applause]
[Music]
amanda survived the assisted pull-ups
she did super great
now is another chance for her to suffer
in order to hypertrophy cable rose
interesting setup here yes i know
there's a cable row station over there
however
we want a mega range of motion these are
cable flexion rows so she is going to be
flexing at the spine
as deep as possible and then arching and
pulling and arching back
thus she's going to be putting her feet
right here into these dumbbells we have
another extender here
things are going to get fun sets of 10
to 20 probably again five sets that's 10
total sets for back g whiz that's enough
back for almost all folks so let's get

finish off let's go up and hold hold
hold down
you are unusually persistent
that's really cool to hear
i just don't get it how people can pose
out
damn that's some warrior something
that helps me train pretty hard is to
understand that
when it starts to feel like really
painful and your body says quit
you make a realization that like that's
probably where much of the hypertrophy
is stimulated
and that if you can hang in and just
keep walking into that darkness over and
over like that's where the good stuff
happens so you reframe your mind from
running away from it instinctually from
pain to running towards it and then
like
good technique only don't worry about
how many reps we'll get to that and
after the set i have one fun trick for
you and we're done
one slow
two slow
three slow keep that left arm straight
