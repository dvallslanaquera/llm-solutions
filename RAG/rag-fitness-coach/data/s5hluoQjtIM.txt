hey folks dr mike here
targeting the muscle series how to
target
your back
in which your lats exist properly with
pull-ups
i'm going to be using smith machine
to help sort of demo pull-ups because
i'm not going to be demoing actual
pull-ups while i talk
but i'll try to do my best to fake it so
that they look like actual pull-ups you
guys ready for tip number one
[Music]
first of all why are these duct tape
handles that look like dildos here this
is my smith machine i modded it because
i'm big enough now that where i can't
actually get under the bar so i do this
i do this
and i do the squats and the good
mornings now that we got that out of the
way pull-ups here's the deal
first tip is find a grip width that
works for you
which means it's hitting the parts of
the muscle that you want
and it's friendly on the joints and can
allow you to produce lots of strength
lots of force lots of power
this means that you can go wide grip
real problem you can go pretty close
grip no problem if you go close grip i'd
recommend taking your thumbs out
like this instead of like this
just easier on the elbows you can go
underhand also no problem as long as the
bottom your elbows and shoulders are
okay cool there are some assisted pull
up setups where you can do regular
pull-ups on that have handles that
aren't exactly straight like this that's
totally fine if you have parallel grips
that's totally cool too play around with
tons of hand positions
there is no such thing as the proper
hand position for a pull-up all the hand
positions make it a different exercise
you can do a few of them for hand
positions for some number of months
another few hand positions for some
other number of months and always cycle
through so that you can do some kind of
pull-up all the time in your program
they're always fresh because of the
different hand positions
all right i'm going to demo this like a
 little
i'll be stepping on the ground so these
are fake pull-ups but here's the thing
i actually do this in my actual pull up
videos so when you see those you can
slow clap
what you want to do is make sure that
you do not rush the eccentric we never
ever ever ever drop into a pull-up so
if i don't get hurt doing this if your
pull-ups look like this
sweet you're doing pull-ups
you're getting from point a to point b
but that's not why you're in the gym
you're in the gym to stimulate
hypertrophy which means especially the
eccentric lengthening phase
needs to be done
concertedly with control
slower so that you get all that massive
stimulus so your pull-ups should look
much more like this
slow controlled deep stretch up
slow control deep stretch
up
that is how you do pull ups you will be
able to do a tiny fraction of the reps
you normally can if you do them slow
controlled but the stimulus to the lats
will be better and that's why the
we're here
[Music]
this tip is get a full stretch at the
bottom which means two things one elbows
straight
and two is gaps completely elevated for
a deep stretch still generating tension
still under control you can dead hang if
you want you don't have to
but you got to get it all the way in
that position why
because muscles seem to grow best when
they're stretched under load and that's
exactly what's happening in the pull-ups
can you go a little shy of the stretch
sure
if you want to get fewer gains but be
able to do more pull-ups so you say oh i
can do 27 pull-ups and i go
show me and you do pull-ups that look
like this
cheating with my feet of course get up
to here you go down to here pretty good
pretty good let me go back up yeah see a
lot of people doing these at the gym
except that bottom 10 to 20 of the pull
up they're missing
is arguably some of the most
hypertrophic 10 to 20
so forget about 27 reps of pull ups do
15 instead
and at the bottom
full stretch you guys see that clearly
pretend my feet aren't there right
full stretch scaps are all the way
elevated elbows are totally straight you
can feel the pain in the lats then come
up in a full don't stop here
all the way down big stretch hold and up
that will you right up in the best
way possible
[Music]
folks let's talk about pulling height
here's how it works
if you're on the weaker end for pull-ups
which i sure as am for my body
weight
what you want to do is get a place where
you can pull to that's rigorous that you
can tell you're getting there to make
sure you check that box and know when
it's a good rep versus when you can't
get another good rep or you didn't get
another good rep
if you can do five to ten pull-ups to
your chin but no more that's probably
where you should be pulling up to so
what this would look like is
i start of course you know from dead
hang and all that stuff and when i pull
up i pull up just to the chin and then
slow and control deep pull up
chin and slow and control deep that's
totally fine as you get stronger and you
can use loaded pull-ups with extra
weight and eventually if using a 25 down
there 35-45 pounds for sets of 5-10
you don't have to pull to the chin
anymore or put on weight
you can start pulling higher because you
are now stronger and get all these
rather really cool benefits so
can you just stick to putting weight on
yourself and going up to the chin
absolutely and there's advantages there
as well
but something cool to try to simplify
your life a little bit or just another
variation to try even if you are doing
the loaded ones to the chin
is to do
pull-ups to the clavicles now these are
a trip let me show you
stab myself with a microphone here
but what you can do is if you're nice
and strong and i've been here before
lighter body weights i'll be here again
probably in a couple months when i
start to get my fat loss on
what i'm doing is it's pretty easy for
me to get to here so i'm not doing that
 anymore
full stretch and then i touch my
clavicle all the way so pull up
touch
and pull up you don't have to hold up
there because that's extra hard but
you're touching all the way to the
clavicle
that's amazing
if you are of most body
and you can do 10 to 20 pull-ups
clavicle touching with a full eccentric
control and drop
you're going to have a
well-developed mac for whatever look you
have
the last level
of where to touch
is if you can do
weighted pull-ups
touching your clavicle for sets of more
than five to ten reps
you may be on the freaky side of
where mostly only gymnasts get to go
or rock climbers or calisthenic
specialists but if you are in
that camp amazing try these and if
you're not in that camp and you get to
being able to do these
you just unlock superpower for pull-ups
because they're an exercise that now is
unbelievably high stimulus to fatigue
ratio for you here it is if you're
strong enough
and this is something uh
arnold was a big proponent of
check this out
pretty weak on pull-ups well up to here
like me
pretty strong get up to the
clavicle touch the clavicle every time
really strong end pull-ups
sternum
slow big stretch
chest up sternum you don't have to pause
but touch if you can touch the sternum
with pull-ups for sets of 10
i want to see your back
send me back picks or gtfo
don't swing like a wild animal
okay
so
it's easy to do pull-ups if you swing
around a lot so i'm gonna do my
fake pull-ups here
you know if you're like wow
you do all this stuff you can get some
more reps problem is it doesn't really
grow much muscle it introduces a ton of
other vectored forces around the joint
which could marginally increase the
probability of injury and since it's the
targeting the muscle series
targeting the muscle is a matter of
really quieting and calming the movement
down
making the movement much more pristine
and much more focused
rather than making it look like you're
doing it in a hurricane
one thing people do get into trouble
with on pull-ups and swinging
is their legs swing too much
so do this thing where after they've
done a pull-up wrap
their legs are doing this and they don't
know how to stabilize them
my best advice to you is actually not to
let the legs get stable because you'll
be waiting forever
my best advice to you
is to get into a cadence
whereby after your last pull-up rep your
legs will swim back and then swing
forward
as your legs are gently swinging forward
you're gonna find yourself more under
the bar and in a perfect position to do
a pull-up
you come down your legs will swing back
and then do another pull-up
it works super well right
so i'm not gonna do any pull-ups because
i'm not warmed up at all and i'm an
active rest right now but if you've done
a pull-up
swing forward so swing back swing
forward pull up
swing back swing forward pull up again
there's a natural cadence you can
develop there which still allows you a
second at the bottom and as your legs
swing in you come back into it
if you want to completely stop
and do super straight up and down
pull-ups in my experience
you're gonna be spending like five or
eight seconds down there waiting for the
likes to stop and it's just going to be
annoying
find that natural mini cadence and don't
worry about the fact that you're
swinging into the pull-up it's just a
tiny little bit it's just for timing
it's going to work out super great
all right folks
last tip
if you get strong enough
to do loaded pull-ups weighted pull-ups
5 10 25
first of all my recommendation is is
when you start to exit your target rep
range let's say you're doing sets of
five to ten in the pull-up amazing
then at some point you can do like sets
of 11 or 12 with no weight
literally get a belt and hang either a
five or two and a half and people are
gonna be like what are you doing that's
not real weight well that's how it
starts
a five or two and a half this week
another week two or three later another
five or another two and a half after a
while you're doing the 25 four sets of
eight amazing
once you get into doing loaded pull-ups
here's a great tip first of all do them
second of all
after you've done a few sets of loaded
pull-ups your reps are going to start to
drop off you get tired
if you go to unloaded pull-ups right
you'll say you're doing 35 pounds for a
set of nine then a set of eight and a
set of six
take the 35 pounds off
and do another few sets of unloaded
pull-ups no weight
the mind muscle connection
with all of your back mostly your lats
is going to be insane your
ability to control is going to be crazy
it's going to feel light but not light
in the way that it's not connecting
light in the way that it's perfectly
connecting
huge tip there is if you're doing your
loaded pull-ups your weighted pull-ups
do a few sets of unloaded after you get
tons of reps your technique will be
 incredible if you're paying
attention
and your mind muscle connection and
those stimulus and thus targeting the
muscle is gonna be awesome you guys like
how i weave that all back together
that's not even a script it's
all up here right what else kind of
crazy do i have up there probably
nothing so fun and i've probably peaked
in popularity i'll see you guys
