hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
in the last several days i have been
lost in the alaskan wilderness
which explains why i haven't had an
opportunity to shave i did fight a
couple of bears though
the judges scored the matches even i
thought i had the advantage my corner
definitely thought i did well but you
know that your corner always thinks
you're doing well
in any case this lecture video whatever
you want to call it
is not about bear fighting although we
should make one of those soon
it's about so related topic actually
coming back from
severe injury which i am told when
mortal people fight bears they are
likely to experience
i of course got away with no wounds at
all as you can tell so
coming back from severe injury what does
that really mean so
first thing we're going to do today is
we're going to define what we mean by
severe injury because you know
if you nick your fingernail a little bit
that can feel severe but may not qualify
then we have kind of a four slash five
phase
process it's not all at once
there are multiple phases and each time
you get through a phase
the way you know you're through a phase
is you've qualified for the minimum
sort of checklist of the next phase like
am i ready to do this next phase well
can you do this checklist so we'll go
through that make sure that everyone
who's coming back from severe injury and
training
is going slow enough and this isn't like
oh go slow or hurt yourself kind of like
pedantic bullshit parents tell you
it's legit like if you go faster than
this you probably just get hurt again
people do this all the time number one
priority
coming back from severe injuries to get
jacked again clearly
number two is to not get hurt again
because if you do that you're not
getting jacked again either so you can
even say
not getting hurt again is probably
number one priority and then after
we're going to talk about how to
transition to really normal normal
training and we'll also see that once
you've been severely injured
normal training is a little caveat it
might not be
1 000 normal but close
let's get into it so what does severe
injury really mean
there's a lot of different definitions
we can use the one we use today is
when you can't use the muscle and or
joint you hurt
in everyday life without severe pain or
notable like
damn this is fucked up kind of pain
that's very different
from a minor injury which a lot of times
like you see you hurt your quad
squatting
and someone's like does it hurt walking
around and you're like i'm not like my
knees not broken in half
and only even if you could do a
bodyweight squat it might just feel a
little weird
and then only when you go heavy does it
actually hurt like that's not a severe
injury
when they come back from that injury is
actually much more straightforward much
faster so on and so forth
but with a severe injury it hurts kind
of all the time in regular daily tasks
like
you hurt your shoulder and you're moving
to get a cup of water and you're like ah
like that's pretty serious that's pretty
legit
and essentially means that you
definitely can't lift hard
hard lifting is for sure out like if
your quad is hurting
while you're walking if somebody asks
you like you're still gonna lift today
you're like what the fuck is wrong with
you
no right like if it hurts walking it's
gonna be like impossible to do any
lifting with
and most commonly severe injuries
are torn or severely strained muscles
they can be joint stuff as well
and they may or may not require surgery
so
severe injury doesn't have to require
surgery but sometimes it's really really
bad and the doctor says look we don't
have to go in and operate there's really
nothing to reattach you're going to heal
by yourself
but this is super super legit and you
can't just train through it and you
can't just have an easy comeback
right so
no easy comeback we have phases
four maybe five phases depending on how
we categorize them i'll
see what uh i mean in just a bit when we
get to it phase one
isn't a phase that you design yourself
it is a phase that is
fostered upon you by the medical
profession it is physical therapy
when you get your physical therapy
prescription that is the first thing
you're going to do and you are going to
do it diligently
you have to because if you rush the
process and skip physical therapy or cut
it off soon
you're very likely to get hurt again
they don't give you pt just randomly for
no reason
physical therapy reestablishes the basic
movement patterns
starts to heal the basic structures onto
which the rest of your recovery is
layered
if you skip physical therapy and you cut
it off soon or something like that or
you just kind of like
what is it called um you know mail in
the results
sort of you're not going to have a very
good time your chance of getting hurt is
much higher and here's the thing
sucks it's boring as shit it's damn near
borderline offensive with the bands and
tiny little five pound dumbbells you
have to use
nobody likes doing pt nobody likes doing
physical therapy
i don't think that's okay because you're
the kind of person listening to this
video you do what it takes
not what you like if you did what you
like you would just go back in the gym
and lift heavy again duh but that's not
an option
do your pt do whatever the pt has you do
do it well and finish the course they
assign first before you do anything else
right and once the pt or doc clears you
for pt being over they may say look you
can't just go back and do normal stuff
you still have to ease in to your
training for that muscle for that joint
don't worry we got what easing in means
is the rest of this lecture the rest of
this video
but they may also and you should ask
them if they don't clear you
for the rest of your muscles because a
lot of times if you have a severe injury
like
like a torn quad even training your
biceps hard creates a lot of
uh blood blood pressure spikes and
abdominal pressure that actually
fucks up your quad a little bit so
sometimes especially post surgery when
they're sutures and stuff attached
kind of on a a bit of a like a sort of
like a really
thin filament you can actually hurt an
injury site that's unrelated just by
training something else hard
so your doctor will tell you no training
hard at all for the next four weeks if
you get surgery or if you don't get
surgery he's like look two weeks
no heart training at all just start
doing your physical therapy and then at
some point
the doc will clear you for training the
other muscles or joints that aren't
involved hard when they do
train them hard you will make excellent
gains
there's two sort of ends of a spectrum
of how your
results can go months after you hurt
your let's say you hurt your quad
one end is you kind of just get
depressed slough off do your pt
slowly start coming back and then once
you're fully
healed you six months later start
training hard again
for your quad and the rest of your body
which means you lost a shitload of
muscle and function in the rest of your
body and then it's like a big comeback
trail
it's not the hardest thing in the world
because comebacks you know usually the
muscle and strength come back pretty
fast but you have to sort of do it all
at once
it's kind of like a lost six months on
the other end of the spectrum
is you do all the due diligence of
taking it time and easy with your quad
that as soon as the doctor clears you
for other physical activity you go train
everything else
hard even your hamstrings if it's
possible even your glutes if it's
possible
almost certainly your calves and
definitely the entirety of your upper
body
six months later what you could do is
once your quad heals to where you can
train it normally again
first of all because of the way we're
going to be doing this comeback process
your quad is almost certainly going to
be as big as it ever was
when you get to that point of trying to
train to normal again because a lot of
the training to get it normal
actually grows considerably but the best
thing there
is when you get to that point six months
later the rest of your body is as jacked
as it's ever been and more
because kind of a cool thing when you're
not training your quad
quads plural sometimes you have lay off
both of them
your maximum recovery volume for the
rest of your body expands like crazy
because quads are so systemically
fatiguing
when you don't have to train quads or
hands or glutes or whatever you hurt
all their muscles in the body can
benefit by training more and recovering
more
so a lot of times when i've been hurt in
the past which has been a fuckload
whatever i hurt as soon as i heard it
i'm like fuck fuck fuck
this is bad and then the next thing i
think of like ooh i can grow the rest of
my body really well
and i usually do and it works out super
well so if you get really really hurt
don't give up it's just time to focus on
something else consider it like a forced
priority
phase a force specialization phase if
you consider like that it really isn't
the worst thing in the world it might
not really be that bad of a thing at all
all right so once you're cleared and
you've finished physical therapy you can
move on to phase two
which is high rep rom training range of
motion training
you essentially do sets of
20 to 30 reps but at first
you know they're like three to five reps
away from failure nothing crazy get a
little bit of a lactate burn going
the sets are sort of challenging but
you're not pushing it pushing it no way
never failure nothing like that that's
for later
when you're doing this that's a 20 or 30
something you know the exercises can be
uh usually just isolation sometimes they
can be compound but but braced like if
you're doing squats
it might be you're holding on to
something and doing squats
and when you're doing these what you're
doing is
you're not focusing on using more weight
every time or doing more reps every time
or adding sets every time
you're focused on doing a bigger and
bigger range of motion not pushing it
like crazy but a little bit going a
little bit more because a lot of times
probably most of the time pretty severe
injuries cause a big reduction in the
range of motion to the joint
to the muscle maybe some combination of
both what ends up happening is like
usually you can squat this deep
now you can just do this so when your
leg extensions your leg presses
and maybe your assistant squats every
few
training sessions you go a little deeper
a little deeper and it hurts
and you stop and you come back and in a
little deeper and it hurts and you stop
and you come back and after a while
you're back to a full range of motion
so sets of 20 to 30 relatively pain-free
completely pain-free or just a little
bit of a twinge to wear like ah
better back off okay so so far that's
our checklist
don't go too close to failure but do get
a little bit of a lactate burn in this
phase
and you're going to do sessions for that
muscle like the rest of your training is
normal and or super normal because you
have so much bandwidth to train it with
between two and four sessions a week
for the target muscle and or joint area
uh and with very little or no doms
generated you're not trying to fuck up
the muscle because it's got enough
problem healing on its own
no overlapping doms ever okay so if you
trained your quads for the first time or
second
time since finishing pt and they're sore
do not do not if your quad was hurt
train it again with any soreness
whatsoever because in normal training we
know every now and again that's okay
but in normal training the integrity of
your muscle is 100
now it's been downgraded to 97 because
you're sore
if the integrity of your muscle is 57
and it's been downgraded to 45
when you're training sore again you may
just get hurt again
do not do that so easy take it easy very
low volume at first
never any overlapping soreness if you're
really just not getting sore at all you
can add a little bit of volume out of
set here and there
take your time and you're ready for
phase three the next phase when
you have gotten most or all of the range
of motion back
and that range of motion is pain-free or
close
so i'll tell you this if i'm like hey
what phase are you at you're like dude
i'm ready for phase three and i'm like
all right
do a leg extension and you do like this
and you're like uh
i'm like what the fuck are you talking
about phase three getting ready for
phase zero get out of here
phase two still okay when
with a light weight something you know
40 or 50 rep max
you can do some reps with a pretty full
range of motion almost or full
and i say hey does that hurt and you're
like a little bit of a twinge at the
extreme but it's not a big deal or
you're like dude honestly like there's
no pain it just feels a little weird or
even if you're like doesn't
feel weird then you're ready for phase
three until and unless you gotta work
with lighter weights to expand your
range of motion and this is really kind
of a continuation of the philosophy of
physical therapy
if you've ever had physical therapy a
huge part of what they do
is uh range of motion expansion right
usually it's like
they increase your proprioception get
you moving to be aware of what's going
on because a lot of times severe injury
you're like i don't even know if my quad
is active or not
i don't know where my knee is in space
uh after they get through some of that
and you start really feel yourself out
then they work on range of motion
because that's huge huge huge
all right phase three phase three you
qualify for as we just said
when you're relatively pain-free or
completely pain-free and you're back to
almost or a completely full range of
motion training there's a bit of nuance
there but you've got to be intelligent
about which way you're going about
if you're there your tissues are
starting to get relatively healed
they are not 100 healed so please do not
go hard now here's a huge mistake i've
got to call out
myself included and many other people
once they get to phase three
and they're pain-free in a four-inch
motion they're like fuck yeah
hard training sets of five grinders pop
goes the weasel if the weasel is your
quad
and then you're fucking in the shit
again bad idea
gotta take it easy take it slow but it's
time to take it a little bit less easy
and less low so you can pump up the
relative effort the relative intensity
this means you just add a bit of
resistance slowly so
the goal here at the end of this phase
is to be able to do sets
of zero to one rir like real close to
failure
in the 25 to 30 rep range which if
you've ever done
is pretty fucking hard and actually in
the scientific literature really
robustly grows muscle
so once you get through phase three and
you're at the end of phase three you're
actually growing muscle at almost 100
full tilt just not through all the rep
ranges and all the loading ranges
you want to probably stick to mostly
isolations in this case just because
they're easier to control
but braced compounds can work what you
don't want to do is just freewheel the
shit
and like dump squats you know uh
do you know super fast squats or
something like that or things that
require a lot of balance
uh here's a good example if you hurt
your quad don't do walking lunges
because just one little schmig this way
or that way can cost you
right can you do some smith machine
squats maybe maybe something like leg
press or hack squat's a better idea and
definitely plenty of lag extensions just
as an example
slow eccentric on every rep this is for
two reasons one it makes the movement
much safer because it slows down the
speed
making less of a chance for high forces
and less of a chance for error
point number two slowly centrics have
actually been shown to
potentiate tissue healing better than
skipping eccentric or taking a fast
eccentric so it's actually
almost physical therapy in and of itself
it's
boring it sucks it's painful it requires
patience for sure
but it's a good idea to do because it
works all right slow eccentrics
pause at the bottom of each rep and
pause
the peak contraction at the top so if
you're doing leg extensions that means
you you do this kick your leg out pause
squeeze
slow slow slow slow slow slow slow
stretch
pause and then up again
squeeze pause slow slow slow slow slow
and pause again and then go again you
guys like this ghetto leg extension with
the finger here
that's how you got to do it again does
that blow of course it blows but does it
drive a
shit load of metabolites into your quads
oh my fuck
generates a ton of metabolites you will
get a pump you probably will get sore
it's good hypertrophy training at this
point it's just tedious and annoying
you'd much rather do sets of you know
five to 15 reps like you normally do
look i'm 100 with you but this is the
way forward this is the safe way
again two to four sessions a week here
generating delayed onset muscle soreness
unlike in phase 2 we don't want to even
generate it
here we want to make sure that it's
totally fine to get doms but no
overlapping doms so if you're still sore
wait heal and then maybe change the
volume so you're not getting as sore
again and overlap
right start with very low volumes work
up slowly
if you're not getting sore anymore then
add if you're still getting sore don't
ever add volume
and take your deloads when you're tired
and then proceed
when are you ready for the next phase
when are you ready for phase four when
two things happen one you're pushing
hard for high volumes
right multiple sets say three to five
sets per session two to four times a
week
without pain or much or any weirdness
like
you're doing these extensions your leg
presses and people like why are you
going so slow
like are you hurt you're like i was hurt
um
and they're like do you feel it now like
not really i guess not really
this is really good that's a really
really good sign and
using higher and higher loads every week
because you want to stay in that 25 to
30 rep range
and you're getting stronger so you're
gonna have to raise the load
and you're very comfortable with them
right bad sign is if like you've been
using 150 pounds on the leg press for
these
and you go to like slowly build up to
175 and your quad feels different at 175
like notably
and it kind of feels weird and a little
bit uncomfortable at the very bottom it
hurts ooh
you're in phase three for a little while
then milk it out
slowly keep it at 175 but repeat that
load
week to week to week really focus on
technique and eventually the pain will
start to go away and you'll start to be
better
but you don't want a situation where
you're like yep next week i start phase
four
and then that like last week before the
next you're in the weirdness and pain
from doing the regular weights
of phase three not good right so notice
you have to earn your progression
through all these phases phase four
is the increasing load phase and this is
when you're a whole lot better
you begin slowly adding load that takes
you out of the 25 to 30 rep range so
maybe
you start out one month with half of
the weights at 25 or half of your sets
of 25 to 30 reps
and the other half of the sets at 20 to
25
then the next month you keep the half at
20 to 25
and the next or the other half will be
15
to 20 reps that's heavier
and then same thing half 15 to 20 next
half 10 to 15.
if each one feels good deload
switch up to lower reps keep going so
you always have a mix of rep ranges but
the mix gets progressively heavier and
heavier and heavier
compounds are totally fine but all still
huge important point with
slow eccentrics and pauses only none of
this
quick stuff that's for later okay
you are ready for phase five or really
kind of a return to normal training
only when the following things happen
you barely even remember what pain and
weirdness in the area felt like
like you're doing these sets and you try
to think back like man
i think my quads are like a hundred
percent or someone's like man what was
it like to
like a few weeks after your quad you're
like think back about it
because remember if your quad's still
fucked up people are like hey what's it
like to hurt your quad you're like i'll
tell you right now
feels fucking weird but if you're like
yeah i guess it
felt weird like think back to some of
the older injuries you've had if you've
ever been hurt
it takes you a little while to be like
what did it really feel like to move my
pack when i hurt my back like oh yeah i
was kind of like some weird lines of
pull
and some pains and little pangs and
stuff but it's not something that's
immediately apparent whereas if you just
hurt your pack or it's still healing
someone's like hey what does it feel
like to have a hurt pack you're like
watch this
feels like that i pull on a table here
and all of a sudden it feels all off
right so if
you're really really really past it and
you really don't even remember what it
was like that's a really good sign
and you're now getting to your best ever
loads
for slow eccentrics in these rep ranges
like maybe
you've squatted 300 for eight slow
eccentric before
uh and or sorry like 300 for well so
we're in a 10 to 15 range
312 slow eccentric before on the squat
that was our all-time best and this last
workout you're like doing 295 for 12 or
three or five
you're back at it right you're not the
strongest you've ever been
because you're still using slowly
centric so duh your loads on the bar
lower
but for what you could do low slow
centrics with back in the day and if
you've never done them you know just
kind of adjust like you're like wow
i can slow centric squat 300 for a set
of 12.
my best ever just regular squat is 315
first set of 12 like man if i sped these
reps up don't don't speed them up yet
but think to yourself if i sped them up
i'd be right there with it so your
strength is really coming close to
normal
that's how you know you're ready for
this more or less final transition
which is the transition to normal
training
in the end of phase four you should
really be comfortable with sets of 10 to
15 reps slow eccentrics and pauses
if there's still weirdness you got to
stay in phase four for longer and still
milk it out
as soon as there's no weirdness you're
good to go next
you want to try a few sets of five to
ten reps heavier
still slowly centrics and possible okay
but that exposes you to much higher
loads and if you're good to go
then you can try some sets next month or
next few weeks
with 15 to 30 reps what the hell we're
going backwards but
without slowing centrics and pauses
legit normal training sets of 15 or 30.
if that feels good what you want to do
counter-intuitive is take an active rest
phase because remember this entire time
you just take in d-loads this is months
later remember this is a severe injury
so this is like
four to 12 months of training you're
gonna need an active rest phase because
you've been training pretty hard and
your quads are back to more or less
they're
they're probably bigger than they've
ever been at this point or quads or
triceps whatever you heard
and they're sure as hell close to as
strong as ever been and you've been
doing a fuck load of volume and jesus
christ two to four times a week training
this is
a lot you want you're like essentially
98
healed what you want to do is take an
active rest phase two weeks or so
of almost no training just fucking
around and
being real safe and then that last two
percent that's when that heals because
you've got
a lot of systemic fatigue we could just
like transition you right to normal
training
but this is kind of like um it's
almost like tapering for a competition
you're almost the best you've ever been
taper
compete right same way as you're almost
healed let's
really finish the whole process by
taking a ton of time off
really relaxing right really relaxing
that's a really really good idea
in the mesocycle after your active rest
phase
you start training normally in the 15 to
30 rep range
but you do slow eccentrics
and pauses in the 5 to 15 rep range if
you train in that range at all some
people like to just train the higher
range
so normal training in the 15 to 30 rep
range and the 515 reps do
slow centrics and pauses if after a
mesocycle of that you feel 1 000
and nothing bothers you then you're
cleared for normal training
now however and this is the last uh
part of this video
err on the side of lower volumes and a
little bit away from failure maybe one
to two reps in reserve at the end
instead of zero to one
for the next few mesocycles at least at
least the next mess
just to feel it out and
always warm up more than you used to
to give yourself the lowest chance of
injury once you have been hurt
you are more likely to be hurt again in
that same spot
unfortunately it's just reality of
biology so
if you used to warm up for bench press
let's say you hurt your pack
you used to get in there you do like a
light set of 10
a heavy set of three and then your
working weight consider
you don't have to do this but consider
from now on
until and unless you just really just
maybe maybe forever
easy set of ten then a set of seven
then a set of five or three to five
then your working weight or a little bit
heavier for one or two reps to feel it
out
and then your working weight now that
sounds like a pain in the ass some
people need those long warm-ups some
people love them some people hate them
once you have been hurt before severely
hurt not just like a little ding you can
forget about those
if you've been severely hurt before and
i've done this before to myself a bunch
and i've seen other lifters i've coached
or interacted with do this
rushing the warm-ups or even in what
used to be a normal warm-up can easily
get you hurt again
it's not likely but it's possible enough
that it's just something you don't want
to fuck with like once you've torn your
pec before you don't want any of that
business ever again
and if it means if you can reduce your
future pect chair chances by 90
from what they are just by taking one or
two extra warm-up sets
for the love of fucking god take that
shit right
and point number two
forever and always try to be a little
bit more of a stickler on technique
back before you tore your quad when you
started
grinding squats you'd shoot your ass up
a little bit throw your head back
fucking just go cut your rep just a
little bit i mean you're still going
below parallel but you're like fuck this
i'm getting more ups and that's okay
it's just a part of being
a young person and training super
fucking hard once you've gotten severely
hurt which you hopefully never will but
if you do
it's time to be a real stickler a lot of
the videos you guys see of me training
on my instagram or on youtube
you'll notice that i'm a real stickler
for like painfully like annoying
technique
that's because i basically torn every
fucking part of my body at this point
thanks brazilian jiu jitsu jk it's
mostly lifting and powerlifting and all
that
stuff so for me being a stickler means i
get to come back tomorrow and train
again
if i want to flare my elbows a bit more
on bench
i talk myself out of it because look i
get one or two reps
tiny tiny little bit of benefit the
chance i get hurt again
is bigger than that and much worse so
once you've been severely hurt
take your time warming up and be a big
stickler for real good technique
technical failure is always the way
you're supposed to fail anyway
like when your technique breaks down
don't do it but your bandwidth your
window of what you consider technical
breakdown
should narrow after you've been hurt
unless you want to get hurt again and
then if you do
fuck this whole rest of the presentation
as soon as let you out of the hospital
put your max squat on the bar dunk that
shit
you're the man all the attractive women
of your specific type
will notice that you're a vortex of
masculine energy
when you dump 600 pounds on yourself and
your quad pops off the bone
they will come and they will by
fellating you
get you to the hospital to get you
healed up again damn that's some satanic
shit
see you guys next time
you
