hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
let's talk about workout window
nutrition
for strength purposes for muscle gain
hypertrophy purposes
and for fat loss purposes let's get
into it so work out when nutrition is
pretty straightforward
it's the idea that three factors can
contribute to your training
performance and body composition here
they are what you eat before training
and essentially how much you eat of it
and when you eat a lot of times say like
people will ask hey what's your
pre-training meal like
and to be perfectly technical i have to
say well it's this this and that
in these amounts but it's also going to
change if i eat it
three hours before training versus an
hour before training because what gives
you energy three hours before training
it takes a little while to digest might
just make you throw up if you eat it an
hour before training or something like
that
next is what you eat potentially eat or
drink during training
how much of it and when and of course
what you eat
after training how much of it and when
that occurs all right so that's
essentially workout with nutrition
it's not rocket science now here's the
thing it doesn't negate calories or
macros
or food types at all it's just another
part of the equation
and it's a very small part of the
equation it's not night and day
it's not like you clean up your workout
window nutrition you're gonna be fucking
superman the next day
but it can add up a little bit over time
and to a meaningful extent so if you're
real
and here's the way i like to phrase this
and let me know if you think this is a
decent way to think about it
if you're so serious about your training
is that you're always on reddit reading
all this stuff
and you're always you know trying to
search for the best answers and you're
you're thinking about this in your
spare time you train like five or six
days a week you really really care
about how jacked and how lean you are
like if someone who hasn't seen you in a
while says dude you're looking jacked
and you gotta be honest with yourself
you're like
damn that feels good to hear if you care
that much you might as well put in some
effort to work on window nutrition
because someone could say like
it doesn't matter that much like yeah
but like i care enough
to where even the little stuff matters
to me right it's like if you're gonna
buy a car
to like take on a track and race around
gee you know the kind of tires you have
do really matter now for a regular car
who cares what kind of tires you have
if you really give a shit about racing
you're going to care about the little
stuff same with workout wind and
nutrition
so first up is strength what does
strength training when your sessions are
to get you stronger
what does that work out when the
nutrition looks like so the pre-workout
meal
is the most important factor in strength
training because it gives you lots of
energy
to do your best it doesn't matter how
well you recover from strength training
workouts
after them if before them enduring them
you're not sufficiently energetic to hit
big pr's and challenge big weights
congratulations you recovered from a
whole lot of nothing so your
pre-training meal is a very very
important meal
and as far as macros you probably want
moderate protein
higher carb and lower to moderate fat
which means protein should be like let's
say you eat four meals during the day
this one over n meal protein means you
eat whatever if this is one of your four
meals you eat one
quarter of your daily protein so if you
eat 200 grams of protein per day and you
eat four times a day
this would be 50 grams of protein right
and then
a little bit more some much some amount
more
than 25 of your daily carbs okay
and let's say you have you know 400
grams of carbs per day
you eat this meal three hours before it
should be like at least 100 grams of
carbs it's a wallop of carbs
you eat that and white rice you're going
to be full of energy and something like
less than 20 of your daily fats right so
as an example
you could have a meal of 50 grams of
protein 100 grams of carbs
and 20 grams of fat just an example but
something in that amount
anything too much up one way or down
from the other will
be questioning if whether or not you're
getting the most out of that pre-workout
meal
now as far as composition is concerned
generally all meals are built around
lean protein
whole grain carbs fruits veggies if
you're further from training two or more
hours
if you're closer to training like close
to like an hour before training or even
closer then faster digesting more
processed carbs are a much better idea
because
they'll get in the bloodstream quicker
you don't want to be in a situation
where you're unracking your heaviest
bench
and your digestion is still like hey man
i still had a piece of fruit in here
none of that's in your bloodstream it's
energy eye track it's gonna make you
feel worse not any better
but if you have like a banana or a thing
gatorade or you know
uh a low-fat pop-tart you know 45
minutes before you train then yeah
you're actually going to be feeling
really good your gi tract is not going
to be annoyed at you
and you often don't really have to add
any fats because just from eating lean
proteins and carbs the ancillary fats
will come up to close to that amount
but if you're further from training and
you're really pushing that 20
you can add some healthy fats and that's
totally fine
so next okay so part of the pre-workout
meal and
pre-training strategy for strength is
hydration you don't want to be
dehydrated
absolutely decreases performance and it
increases injury risk as well so
the thing about hydration is there's
kind of two kinds of hydration
there's what you could just call
hydration at face value which is like
person is dehydrated they are given one
liter of water that's right we're in
canada doing liters
smash liter of water put it down you are
now hydrated now
as a system you're technically hydrated
because there's water somewhere in the
system
but honestly that water is just like in
your esophagus and flowing into your
stomach
and your muscles if you're gonna you
know do strength training and really
pull on your tendons they're still
dehydrated
because water doesn't magically just
zoom you're not a sponge it doesn't just
zoom through you
it takes a few hours to get you total
dehydration and all of your sorry
total hydration of all your body systems
so you want to hydrate
well in advance drink leader or water
three hours or something like that
before training
and then you want to make sure that in
your pre-workout meal you have plenty of
fluids so that you pee
clear at least once uh between the meal
and the session so you want to be in a
situation where like you pull up to the
gym you know oh i gotta pee
you pee and it's pretty clear and high
volume you could be pretty sure as long
as you weren't super dehydrated before
then
if you're relatively normally hydrated
you pee clear once before training
you're good to go
your actual tissues that are gonna be
contracting are well hydrated
super super important what you don't
want to do is be like oh man i'm like
pee and dark red if you're painting
doctor i'd go to the hospital but you
know pee in really dark
and like 15 minutes before training you
smash like half a gallon of water like
congratulations you know bloated your
stomach up
and it's going to be hours before you're
systemically hydrated anyway
better than nothing but not exactly
accomplishing what we want so hydration
starts early make sure that's a part
of your pre-training strategy
intra-workout
for most purposes drinking water is just
fine you don't have to have any food
because it gets there a little too late
if your session is much longer than an
hour an hour and a half
then maybe a protein carb hydration
drink is a good idea
so what you want on that drink is half
of the normal amount of meal protein
so if you normally eat like five meals a
day and it's 200 grams of protein which
means 40 grams in each meal
then in a shake that you're using enter
training more like 20 grams in the meal
half the normal amount
10 of your daily carbs zero fats so it
should be like whey protein and gatorade
combo
and the fluid should be like eight
percent solution or something like that
so if you have you know so a liter of
fluid which is
one thousand grams of fluid that's going
to be a total of 80 grams of protein
protein plus carbs in there
that's eight percent solution so because
if you do anything more concentrated
it actually uh you have to drink more
water on top of that to get the
hydration to go through
if you drink anything less than that
then it's fine it hydrates you really
well
but it's going to be a shitload of fluid
to drink to get all those proteins in
carbs you might just start
peeing mid lift or something like that
which is you know fun it's a good time
at the gym but maybe not ideal for your
circumstances
post workout for strength training
that meal is very important not as
important as a pre-workout meal
but almost the exact composition macro
so on and so forth of the pre-training
meal is totally cool
so it's pre-training meal what we
described intra shake maybe usually just
water
post-training meal pretty similar and
you know you eat the post-training meal
about as soon as possible that doesn't
mean you'd like
race home or something like that but
i'll put put it to you this way if
you're waiting longer than an hour to
start eating after an important strength
training session you're missing some
time
so any time between right after and half
an hour to 45 minutes later is totally
cool if you're waiting longer than an
hour
you could be eating a bit excuse me you
could be eating a bit sooner
now hypertrophy workout window nutrition
a little bit different
pre-workout is of course very important
to get tons of energy
it is very similar to the strength
training stuff so you just follow that
verbatim
intra workout water is just fine for
most purposes
just like for strength training and if
your session is much longer than an hour
hour and a half
protein carb drink is a good idea uh it
hydrates you and it actually promotes
anti-metabolism it sort of reduces how
much muscle loss you may experience in
the session
same idea as with the strength shake you
know half the usual amount of protein 10
of your daily carbs zero fats eight
percent solution you're good to go
the post-workout meal is probably the
most important meal for hypertrophy
because it potentiates the anabolic
response after training
if you don't have a proper post-workout
meal or no post-war company they're all
after training
your body's signals during the training
is like growing muscle growth muscle
muscle
and afterwards your your uh you know
your body's standing at the bus station
muscle growth and
nothing's no buses are stopping
nothing's coming by and it's like i
guess
i'm supposed to take the muscle growth
bus but
no it's coming again and then your body
will just walk to wherever muscle growth
occurs but that sucks it's raining and
it takes a long time not as effective
so if you don't eat really well after
workout you miss a bit of the benefits
now
if you have an awesome proper
post-workout meal
okay the equivalent of that analogy
stupidest fucking analogy ever
is if your muscle growth or your your
body is waiting at the muscle growth bus
stop right after training
this huge megabus of just like totally
sexually depraved nymphos tons of drugs
and alcohol rolls up
and the doors part and you know like a
reincarnated michael jackson's driving
the bus and all the best parts of
michael jackson
and his music blaring and it's like hey
you going to the party and you're like
oh my god yes and your body gets in
there and it goes to muscle growth
heaven
and all is well whoo stretching
the analogy uh a rubber band there a bit
but in any case
it's important all i'm trying to say is
the post-workout meal is important and
it should be consumed
asap okay so it's not unusual for
bodybuilders when they stop training
protein shake carb shake boom right down
the hatch and then they drive home and
then they have their first post-workout
meal so
the macros for either that shake or the
meal or combined
should be moderate protein the usual
amount
high carb and low fat okay so
normal amount of protein so if you let's
say if you have you know four meals a
day and 200 grams of protein that'll be
a 40 40 gram of protein meal
right 30 or more of your daily carbs
that's a lot
right and then uh 15 or fewer of your
daily fats because we don't want the
fats to slow down the digestion
and we want the carbs to get right in
there exert the big glycemic load and
lacinic index right away an example is
like 50 grams of protein or something
like that
120 grams of carbs remember the strength
example is 100
and only 15 grams of fat the strength
example was
20. this does mean that folks focused on
hypertrophy training
might not be able to eat out as
conveniently as strength trainees
you're probably familiar if you're a
hypertrophy person or a bodybuilder your
strength training friends can just eat
out anywhere
after the training they just pick
relatively healthy options and they're
good because the carb to fat ratio is
more normal
but your carbs are going to be higher
fats are going to be lower and that
means that you don't have
as many options now composition wise you
could probably have predicted some of
this
we're going to have leaner proteins that
are relatively faster digesting so
enough nothing like
nothing like you know super fatty ground
beef which takes a while to get through
the system
faster digesting processed carbs if
closer training especially
no added fat so just some examples you
could have a sugary cereal
with skim milk and whey on the side or
you can put your weight in the cereal i
don't think it ruins the taste i just
like to chug my way after right after
and protein shake with frozen yogurt
so great thing to do after i purchase
your workout is if there's a froyo place
close to your gym
you bring a protein shake with you and
you order a shitload of froyo
easy on the high fat toppings smash that
shit drink a protein shake amazing
um lean sushi etc the sushi was just
like the fish and rice
not a ton of the mayo and shit like that
really really great options as ideas for
post-workout meals
for hypertrophy all right switching
gears
now cardio workout nutrition
is different and it's different in two
ways
first it's a little bit of a different
approach than you'd normally take to any
other kind of training
second when we mean cardio here just in
this video
we're talking about a dedicated session
to burn fat okay this is not like
endurance cycling or getting ready to
play tennis
this is cardio to burn fat how do you
eat in relation to that
very very common question that i'm super
pumped i'm answering right now because
we get it atomic good
what do we do is it fasted is it not
fasted do i have to eat before during
after what's going on so here's the deal
direct research shows that fed and
fasted cardio so whether or not you eat
before cardio or don't eat
basically leads to about the same
effects on fat loss if you do fed cardio
you do burn a lot of the food you eat
and not a lot of your body fat but that
means you get
less food later and you burn body fat to
make up for it if you do fasted cardio
you burn
a lot of just your own body fat but then
you eat more food later because the
macros are the same for each condition
and you don't burn as much body fat
later so dealer's choice but they lead
to almost the same results
however there are some practical
concerns here that probably bias you
in the direction of a bit closer to
faster cardio and here's why
you're usually not hungry when you're
doing cardio when you're sitting around
trying to do work on your computer
or you're listening to like a zoom
lecture one of your professors or
something and you're like fuck
i can eat a fucking horse i can't
concentrate damn it fat loss sucks
when you're doing cardio you put your
tunes in you're put in a podcast you're
on that treadmill
you're like usually very hungry right
then and there because there's a bit of
a fight-or-flight response even just a
tiny one get your mind off of shit
you're actually doing something
so cardio can be viewed as not hunger
time
okay and so so there's a reason not to
eat before cardio because we don't need
to not be
hungry because we're not gonna be hungry
anyway drink cardio okay so point number
one point number
two is you don't need a ton of energy to
do cardio you do when you're doing
performance cardio but fat loss cardio
for the love of
god it's low intensity if you need a ton
of energy to do you know 120 beats per
minute on the elliptical
or incline walking good god like you're
you must be real deep into your cut or
something like that
so usually you don't need a ton of
energy so
if you're doing cardio in a fasted state
okay without having eaten recently then
you're kind of buying yourself
more non-hunger time and then when you
eat your meals later
they're closer together and that means
that if you get your cardio in when you
don't have food in your stomach
you add like an hour or two to your day
when you're not hungry and then later on
the rest of the day you get
quote-unquote more food same amount of
food in a smaller feeding window which
means you get to feel fuller it's kind
of a best of both worlds
now when you're done with cardio you do
want to eat something especially with
protein in it to reduce catabolism and
make sure your body's back
into a sort of recuperative state and
carbs are optional in this case so it's
totally fine to do cardio and then eat a
meal of just protein or just protein and
fat
lower on the fats usually because you
want the proteins to get in there but
nonetheless carbs are
either way dealer's choice so here's the
thing
practical considerations if you do
cardio in the morning
don't eat before get it done then have
breakfast great idea
you can have like i don't know black
coffee or something and then give
yourself a little bit more energy that's
totally fine
if you do cardio in the middle of the
day wait at least three hours
and after your last meal so if you eat a
meal at one pm
don't do cardio until like four pm then
do cardio four to five and then have a
meal after
that maximizes the length of that not
eating window and it gives you more
opportunities to stay full
later throughout the rest of the day and
you probably want to avoid doing cardio
as your last activity of the day
because you don't want to get into a
catabolic state and then go to sleep
okay what you want to do is if cardio
you do in the evening
do your cardio then at least have like a
casein shake or some slow digesting
protein
go to sleep so that your muscles can be
recovered to some extent catabolism can
be muted
and then you don't lose a lot of muscle
overnight it's never going to be a lot
but it can be some and over many many
days and weeks and months
of fat loss dieting you don't want to
get in the practice of doing a ton of
cardio
and then not eating anything right after
for a long time folks
if you're curious about much more
in-depth explanation with tons of
nuances
we have the renaissance diet book
renaissance diet 2.0
has an enormous chapter on nutrient time
which covers all these ins and outs and
tons of other specifics
give that a thought and uh see you next
time for the next video
you
