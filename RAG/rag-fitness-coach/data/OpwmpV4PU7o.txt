troll all the way up all the way up
there we go one more there all the way
up push
push the last time doing this
[Music]
shit folks Welcome To Zero Gravity
Fitness huh am I right all right I can
read this is Ryan Benson then guess who
he coaches Mr Larry Wheels that's right
in the flesh boy there's a lot of him I
don't know why I look down that's shared
feather ifb Pro he also has a penis
anyway uh we're going to be doing some
chest some triceps some shoulders maybe
even some biceps if we're lucky going to
get our swole on and we're going to talk
that shit so 3 two 1 hit
it
first exercise is the close grip Smith
machine bench PR we're going to be
focused on doing controlled Ecentric
nice Paws in the chest nice F lock out
and all the way back down sets of five
to 15 reps let the guys adjust to what
they feel best with you're used to the
the pauses with like the sinking you
know for power lifting right try to do
like a soft pause at the very top of
your chest when you're bringing the bar
down try to meet the bar with your chest
that's going to emphasize the stretch
more you're literally stretching your
pecs more when you put it out like this
all right
a little more control little more
control and then pause soft paw straight
perfect soft pause at the top Crush
beautiful good
enough well what happened in 7 to 10 man
well you said it do one to two I
actually surpassed his goals oh was yeah
yes so the first sets like a
potentiation you've done that in a power
up thing I'm sure work up to something
either like 10% above your working load
or right at the working load do a couple
reps and then go into your sets after
that just to like Prime the nervous
system in layman term AB for the actual
working sets so now when he goes back
down to 35 for his working sets it's
just going to
float good stuff good
stuff I think you I think you quit with
like five in the tank no definitely not
not that
Tempo no way I do more than you Larry
everybody's going to call you a
[Laughter]
[Applause]
fraud all right uh-oh I didn't count
uh-oh more nine I got
nine just had to one at me had to one
out me so do you want me to purposely go
slow on the concentric as well or the
entric explosive on the concentric but
slow on the entric yeah so I so we can
explode up we can explode up after a
distinct pause been trying to go like
slow on the way up on the way down quick
on the way up oh
okay good full
pause big
pause
yep all right this one's for
Nick this one's for
Greg trying to expose yourself to as
deep of a stretch as you can and wish
your lifts especially under like a
control Ecentric is really safe and
really effective for muscle growth and a
lot of the literature and data is poting
in that direction might be something to
work in you can still throw heavy shit
around cuz you got to enjoy training
first and foremost which why I like what
you guys do working in some of this type
of shit for like intensity techniques
drop sets or things of that nature
really good stuff for muscle growth oh
without a doubt I mean what I post on
socials is a very small part of what
actually doing training on a dayto day
yeah yeah you know we LIF heavy maybe
twice a month yeah and the other 28 days
of the month we're doing that's slow and
under control getting a good
pump
H
yeah
beautiful oh do you want 365 again or
there two top sets pretty good and
you'll go higher rep range now 315 I'd
like to go higher rep range to yeah I'm
down that too keep your shoulder healthy
there the PEX p on the way up too just
the ceiling the whole time just to the
ceiling even on the way up there you
go
[Applause]
oh yeah all
right fast twitch ass
[Laughter]
yeah don't like this he's he's got that
jewi with athletic back in the Jewish
Community Center Day Camp days I was
fucking Unstoppable in tennis in class B
in the class B of the championship for
also Jewish
kids but anyone under me they fucking
felt my wrath Fells you have no
idea incline dumbell yeah does that feel
okay definitely he was telling me
dumbbells feel pretty good for you they
do yeah I can
do incline dumbbell press focusing on
keeping the chest up pushing the
dumbbells out to the outsides in a deep
stretch for every single one a little
pause one to two seconds this is tough
this is not how mom used to do it it's
not how Grandma used to do it but it's
the one of the best ways to do it
because you maximize that stretch under
tension uh it's really good stuff Jared
feather the ultimate technician watch
him do it
whoa that vein in his right shoulder
looks
scary that's from stards
you Roy monster
you what do you think want try it I was
distracted by your pain to be honest
pretty disgusting this yeah oh my whoa
wait wait wait I got to do that thing
just saw that oh I feel sick yeah oh God
just one snip bleeding out even on the
way up try to kiss the ceiling with your
pecs so like you're going to come down
you're going to have a big chest and
most people want to do this try to keep
it here like this
this it'll make it even harder and you
use even less load but you'll get the
same benefit it'll feel nice all
right people just be like wow Larry got
weak so big big chest expose the chest
bigger chest bigger chest bigger chest
and keep it there on the way up too
good deep deep hold that
[Music]
stretch
push
it oh
yes how many was that 16 whoa why you
had to raise the bar so damn High relax
already I'm weak I got to do High Reps
got to impress somehow there
[Applause]
let's go
Jared
[Music]
nice is it everybody crack or is it just
because there's no music we can hear
it like I can hear all these pops maybe
maybe it happens every day we just have
the music so loud this is like ASMR oh

detect any authenticity in that
statement do you just need bigger you
just need bigger addictors and like a
little more
sweep
push Downs my rep match so whatever you
get on your first set straight set you
have to get the same number of Reps for
two sets after using myor rep's rest
pause elbows
[Music]
back so he's coming in at the top it's
just your arms flush to your sides and
your elbows go back as they come up they
don't come up like this they come back
like back really try to like basically
push your elbow back behind your body
try to almost touch them back here as
far back as yeah it look good it looks
good and at the top here you can come up
if you want and away from the body and
then back in and down okay closer to the
St got yeah get a little closer then
you'll be able to get your El
Back That
Ass it is that's earning your snaps

work out do you like to listen to music
uh I actually listen to softer stuff if
I'm going to train really hard really
because I can hurt myself feel like you
listen to a podcast when you train
yeah knowled consuming don't really
listen to it if I know that I'm like a
little too amp that day a little bit too
much personal shit these guys are I calm

a lot of gear what turns your eyebrows
up oh shit 25 years of coaching and
getting people from other coaches let's
say it this way local National and
professional total yes the same number
for all of them cuz every trying to go
pro total total we milligrams let's not
get into grams just yet I'm kidding it's
a
joke I've

8,000 damn dude that's some Dragon Ball
Z shit you've had them up there or they
no no I've had guys that have come to me
running totals of like 8,000 Jesus
fucking I think totals of about pretty
standard about 18 00 yeah yeah for prep
for
[Music]
prep bicep
curls all the other stuff to make you
jacked this is to get you fucking laid
it's a well-known scientific fact that
girls only look at two things when
they're trying to fuck you one is biceps
two got the video guy my God in any case
three sets here my rep m
however many your UPS you get on the
first you got to match that same on the
second and third even if you take rest
breaks shit is going to get painful big
technique you here is to stay out front
keep your elbows out a little bit at
least in front there that way you still
have mega tension on the bottom for that
stretch that was in make it hard make it
hard make it
hard Ultra slow control control control
W wait four WPS after about 5 or 10
seconds me to it going to burn it should
only get
worse it should only get worse Larry yes
slow fight those Lev in on the way up
slow it should be hard one more good
technique only good technique yes yeah
that's it that's
it yeah
the fast twitch athlete yeah you're fast
twitch as fuck shit just stops working
well that's the least exciting way for
me to train biceps guess results but man
it boring
these guys are like ducks to water with
this technique shit
man Masha got nothing to worry about all
that selfcontrol he
got good shit
dude oh
[Music]

the E Centric it's actually quite a
decent shoulder uh raise machine so so
let's uh figure out what's going on I'm
Up's up hey hey you're big dog you're
the man
fucking I don't want to be a bully up
trying to hang out the bottom too much
