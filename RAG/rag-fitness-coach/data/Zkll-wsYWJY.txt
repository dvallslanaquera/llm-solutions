sometimes what I like to do is make the
last warm up a little bit heavier than
the working sets to really potentiate
theck out of the nervous system makes
other sets not only seem lighter much
more to the point it allows me to have a
better stimulus to fatigue ratio on
those work sets so instead of set number
one of 10 being like very
awkward if I do a warm-up with just a
bit more weight than the actual exercise
then the idea is the first set we'll
feel already pretty
decent

oh that is a heavy warm up holy but it
works
