okay good technique it's not good you
don't like any jerk on this yeah no
jerks your back looks twice as big as
when you walked in here it feels twice
as fucked up I don't even know what to
say because everything is right
[Music]
yo Doctor Mike here for Amazon
securitization Jared feather here also
pronounce sounds familiarization Mr if
you Pro Mr Steal Your Girl
ish in any case
there are two things we do not have for
you today
we do not have Alpha destiny
Nobody Like That by any name anywhere
but we do have Alex Leonidas
and we don't have 300 Warrior trains oh
type motherfucker Spartans
because we only need one he called me on
my rotary telephone I picked it up and
he was like people getting into these
back workouts without understanding how
basic back size is built trying to do
fancy cable shit I need to hit my outer
latch my fucker you don't have any laps
right so for real hardcore no
biomechanic Circa 2021 BS which has its
place we'll talk about in a second we're
doing a hardcore for real back workout
today absolutely nice pleasure having
you on the channel how do you feel about
all this Mike's pleasure to be back on
I'm so excited for this old school is
where it's at that's how I built this
back with pull-ups rows the basics you
can never go wrong and although Alpha
Destiny is gone Alex United and bear
mode
let's go
all right folks so you'll notice that we
are starting the workout with weighted
pull-ups but we're actually starting
with pull Downs why because if you just
go right to pull-ups especially weighted
pull-ups that's like go into your
regular working weight in the bench with
no warm-up that's nuts you're gonna get
ship performance probability of injury
is going to go way up fuck that so we do
pull Downs light then pull Down's a
little heavier set of 12 set of eight
then the next thing we'll do is probably
unweight it he'll do a set of two to
four pull-ups with his body weight and
then the next set will be a working set
where he actually puts weight on and
goes to town when we do these pull-ups
watch for slow control
standardized height and a big stretch at
the bottom with a little pause that's
where we're going to get it right you're
going to build a shitload of back width
doing the fucking compound heavy Basics
now so I'm just going to address this
right up front here
what about that cash ball shit for shit
fucking that shit it's fucking great it
fucking works but it's not an either or
a lot of your masks will be built
through conventional shit fucking
overloads the dick out of the muscle now
when you're really big and you want to
focus on a part of it this cash shit is
awesome this workout is Hardcore because
it uses effective movements from back in
history because it's historical fucking
old school guys had it right all along
bullshit they had a lot wrong but they
had some shit right this
that's my view on the ship Jared may be
less nice about this and we'll see what
Alex Leonidas and on the one hand he's
Canadian on the other hand he's Greek
the Greeks keep it real the Canadians
are all nice huge stretch feel it good
there a couple more
come on
oh yeah slow
[Applause]
the pull-up is a movement that often
gets bastardized with a ton of momentum
yes
and uh no full range of motion at the
bottom or top in fact
this can be taken to an even further
level by doing Chester Bar
and for that I would reckon that nobody
has to go waited yeah like even Franco
Colombo
who uh I think was five and five you
know 185 yeah
you never went
with a 25 or 45 officer yeah
just High Reps as wide as possible
full range of motion faster bar Chester
Bar full stretch so hard to the sternum
right here
oh yeah
those are great
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
break at least one more
go
yes slow
slow stretch weight crack
beautiful
beautiful control Tempo long closet
about it yeah that's bleeding my
strength quite a bit oh yeah like I
played as hard right now this is not
fake intensity no yeah that would be
weird yeah and like and my arms are even
pumped right now it's awesome so
everything true forums got bigger since
your show dude you've been jacking off a
lot absolutely on the dailies but the
problem is there's been a crusade
against the basics yeah and I'm tired of
it yeah I'm fed up because we know what
works and pull-ups are not going away
yeah so when I see someone saying look
how strong I am he's on my 15 sloppy
reps I'm like no this this is
people talk shit about pull-ups and bent
rows or precisely that people have never
seen them demonstrate a well executed
pull-up or bent row that's right you do
bent rolls properly like Kai Greene does
where he bends all the way over
fucking full stretch all the way in pull
up the same way you're gonna be like oh
my God my fucking lats are back
completely blown up
and control yeah one more
thank you
go yes slow
beautiful crap
huh that's it that's it
Alex did three sets of weighted Pull-Ups
now we stay doing pull-ups but we take
the weight off it's an automatic downset
we're gonna do it for two sets then
we're moving on to pull Downs so
basically we have vertical pulling that
starts out heaviest and as the body
tires we go lighter lighter lighter it's
just a succession of down sets and the
pull Downs are essentially down sets for
pull-ups sort of it's a bit of a
different curve a bit of a different
feel we could use a different grip to
increase the variation somewhat but here
it'll be the same grip same everything
same technique identical everything
except body weight and so we'll be
looking to do maybe 10 to 15 reps on our
first set we'll see
nine
[Music]
ten nice and easy
[Music]
when you use
hypertrophy specific technique
chin to the bar no pausing at the top
real quick chin slow on the eccentric
and a full Big Stretch pause at the
bottom the pull-up will humble the
living fuck out of you
I at a body weight of anywhere between
225 and 250. can typically do about 10
to 15 pull-ups fresh
I swear to God everyone on Instagram's
like really just eight pull-ups on your
second set I thought you were big and
I'm like motherfucker you have no idea
what you're saying you come train with
us we'll teach you how to do pull-ups
the right way you may get zero you
little bitch that's you Frank if you
stop commenting on my stuff
six
[Music]
years
[Music]
can you set this man up on the pull down
that's three sets of weighted pull-ups
two sets of unweighted pull-ups that's
five total sets of pull-ups we're well
on our way with the fucking vertical
pulling musculature last tears major
long ahead of a triceps gets hit rear
delts biceps form flexors forearms it's
all cooked
three sets of pull Downs are up next and
then we go into the rows these pull
Downs you're gonna watch for some cues
you're gonna really expand at the top of
the Big Stretch chest up Big Crunch at
the bottom just a gentle touch at the
bottom we don't want to hold it not a
very advantageous position to put a lot
of stretch under load for the lats so
gentle touch here just for consistency
and then a slow essential for the Big
Stretch at the top beautiful now
we're gonna be doing slightly higher
reps here we already did a low rep work
he did basically everything with sets of
five to ten roughly already we're gonna
do sets of 10 to 20 for these pull Downs
probably the first set is going to be
like 15 to 20 and then let the Reps drop
off after that
yes one more
cool
that's it slow
oh that's it
oh
feel a pump yo
I'm so pumped right now this is amazing
all right bent Rose Ben Rose last one
last exercise sort of comments do it
since we're fatigued now
won't take much no not at all and the
lower back will never be a limiting
factor yes especially if you do your
vertical pulling first that's right it's
all bad it's all upper back lap active
lat limiting factor yeah
uh feet inside shoulder width
you're gonna hit hinge right into it
tummy out chest up Arch lower back when
you get down to it you're going to want
to take the bar out here a little bit
wider than shoulder width
no movement so you're going to take the
slack out of it just float here touch
right below your sternum for a quick
second and give stretch touch the ground
sternum touch the ground as soon as
you're done take a quick break move in
one Fist and then regular Rose touching
the tongue good
good
good fuck it it's a work set keep going
good
good no swinging
yes
yes don't swing don't jerk
there it is ice forward yeah big shot
one more
it's just at the same time yeah that's
it and down narrow
big stomach
no swinging
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
um you know what it is man we'll do
three sets this and then three sets of
bent row same weight no super set we
were gonna plan on doing superset
of chest supporters sorry chest
supported we got Rose to the chest
barbell
super set to regular Rose to the tummy
but fuck that Alex is the type so we're
gonna do a couple sets of roasted chest
rest in normal amount of time and in a
couple sets of regular roast for the
tummy
yes good that's it okay good technique
no jerks you know what makes it hard
because
it's not lengthened by us man so it's
like the cheat helps smooth out the
resistance curve I feel so I actually
have a recommendation for how to do that
don't don't super set relax relax relax
no supersack oh yeah sure yeah yeah so
Alex made a very good point he pointed
out the fact that the uh bent row was
not lengthened by us and if you fail
when you can't touch your chest anymore
you have a lot more left here if you
wanted but you're being limited by this
weak position totally valid if you're an
advanced lifter and we'll have this uh
this is on a to-do list of RP video
somewhere its own breakdown you're an
advanced lifter and you already know how
to do a strict back row you can take it
to the next level and make the Metro a
little bit more length and biased by
doing this so normally
you would touch
and when you got to failure yeah that's
it
you can do in a normal bent row to make
it a little bit more challenging and
interesting if you can do the regular
version
is as the row becomes a little bit more
difficult for you or even from rep one
come back down to the same bottom
position but the top position is
slightly elevated to allow you to have a
mechanical advantage to track and to
touch your tummy so what you can do is
here we start here notice my position
as I come up I tilt up a little bit
tilt up
tilt out
tilt up
tilt down and you can do this regular
until you get tired and you're like okay
and then the next one tilt up tilt down
notice the Tilt is still coming from my
hips yeah so I never swinging it's not
an athletic motion it's a smooth
adjustment
uh
boom
crap
[Music]
yes
one or two more one two more
control control
yes one more control from the top
stretch oh look for it
shit I just gotta show you the back
bumps
it's unreal your back looks twice as big
as when you walked in here
it feels twice as fucked up I appreciate
it
perform guidance of keeping me in check
guys check this out Alex is one of the
strongest motherfuckers on social media
doing crazy ass weighted pull-ups bench
in 315 for 10 shit like that I saw that
by the way I jacked off to her
no I didn't not to it but I it got me to
where I needed to be to wear that next
video I nutted to
and uh today at the end of the back
workout he is using 115 pounds for sets
of five to ten on bent rows so you think
you're strong amazing use Precision
technique for hypertrophy control
eccentrics touching your tummy every
time bending way the fuck over you can
lean up if you want at the top
you will understand that it does not
take a lot of load to get a fucking
insane workout Alex any wise words for
our uh for our viewers and the folks
came from from your community to see
this video what do you think well first
of all I think they're gonna love it
because we focus on the basics and
ultimately
that's what many of us should be
focusing on
as you described perfectly I usually go
a lot heavier than this even for low
repetitions less volume
my technique is always good but not to
this extent right this is a new level
this is control with long pods because
it's one thing to make it brief a second
but when you're holding after three
seconds at the bottom and isometric
Contracting low back oh
that lights you up and right now man
like
I don't even know what to say because
everything is right yeah and none of
this was active like the faces the
straining
like RP training works and you guys got
to try it out with stuff like this
and you don't need a fancy gym
this one's nice but very nice oh yeah
this is one of the fastest gyms in the
world we use like two percent of the
fancy we're in the section where it's
empty using a basic Olympic Bar you know
so if you can get by with a polar bar a
simple lap pull down machine a barbell a
couple dumbbells your fucking goal your
money focus on the technique focus on
that steady progression you have the
hypertrophy app a thought if you don't
like the app fuck it don't use the app
use your own shit you'll get where you
need to go drug free not Drug Free
50 50. uh it's all gonna work out focus
on good technique do your best effort
check out Alex Leonidas he's got his own
YouTube channel he puts out great shit
he's got his own Instagram he puts out
even better shit he's got his own only
fans but you're probably not good enough
on there because that's the like black
caviar mixed together with champagne 100
anyway
these zombies
[Music]
thank you
