hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's fitness myth
number nine is that fruits cause fat
gain
interesting let's find out if it's true
so first what is the actual nature of
the claim more specifically
well a lot of people just stop right
there if you eat fruit you're going to
get fat but some of the smarter ones
will say that well you know fructose
is bad especially bad for health and
liver values and blood markers and
inflammation
and you should stay away from it and
because fruits have fructose
in them
then you probably should stay away from
fruits as well generally how we hear
that one fine
all right why is it wrong why is it a
myth
well direct studies on long-term high
fructose diets do not seem to indicate
uh predictable weight gain and
predictable fat gain
so
you know at least the fat and weight
gain stuff doesn't seem to add up a
whole lot
now one of the reasons for that is
because
if you take in higher fructose
at first there's a hunger dysregulation
mechanism potentially especially with
very high amounts but then that tends to
subside as leptin sensitivity goes up
and leptin is generally a hormone that
makes you feel full so if you're more
sensitive to it then you feel more full
given the same amount of food
and
in fact
chronic high fructose feeding may
actually suppress food intake in the
long term may
and long term being weeks so they've
done a few studies that are pretty good
and they just can't reliably say okay
you're gonna for sure gain fat if you
eat uh fructose or high diet high in
fructose
however there is a group of studies in
which people do gain fat
on fructose high diet but those are
almost always
when fructose heavy drinks
liquid carbs are added to the diet
and correlational studies show that
people that drink fructose heavy drinks
every kind of fruit juice you can think
of and of course every kind of soda
that's not diet they have the worst
health outcomes
and here's the thing we're saying okay
fructose is bad in excess and sugary
beverages that's a big maybe and in fact
probably a yes
but what about fresh fruits can you
excessively consume
fresh fruits and then your fructose
consumption is something that the
medical community would determine as
potentially not great for you the answer
is almost certainly not
right
so
more specifically the opposite is shown
that in analysis after analysis people
who eat more fresh fruit as a percentage
of their diet are almost always leaner
and healthier
and in fact the introduction or pushing
through of more fresh fruits into diets
that don't typically have as many
usually and predictably in randomized
controlled trials
leads to reductions in body fat and
weight and an improvement in health
parameters because if you're saying
fruits are bad
but then in the population people who
eat more fruit tend to be healthier
and also if we make typically regular
healthy people eat more fruit and they
get more healthy
gee whiz you know that's not selling the
whole argument of fruits are bad all
that well as a matter of fact it's
selling quite the opposite argument
there is a mechanistic reason
many mechanistic reasons for why this
could be one is that fruit is incredibly
filling for the number of calories it
had so if you said to yourself that's it
man i'm gonna go volunteer
to be on the show my 600 pound life i'm
gonna be 600 fucking pounds
watch me work but i'm gonna do it with
fruit
fresh fruit
how many oranges and peaches are you
gonna eat
until you don't want to eat anymore i
don't know like five
all right ten find thirty that i would
like to see you maintain for a few days
especially keeping your colon intact
it's just not a thing when people get
hyper obese and hyper poor health it's
not by overeating fruits but we do know
what it is
and why they get there
so here are the grains of truth to the
fruits thing with the fructose part
when people eat freely
and on top of that consume
fructose-laden beverages they get
significantly more abdominal obesity and
negative health markers
versus even if they take in a
glucose-based shake with the same number
of calories the margin is small but it's
there
so
excess calories that are super easy to
take in not great
and when those excess calories are made
of a large fraction of fructose
marginally even worse than that
if dietary fructose is really high
you can get negative metabolic
consequences for sure insulin resistance
high triglycerides high inflammation
levels by uric acid long list but in
order to get there you usually
have to consume a crapload of dessert
foods that are
so i don't want to say artificially
sweetened um sweetened extra with the
addition of uh sucrose or fructose
sucrose is tons of fructose in it by the
way
so
these cakes and cookies and stuff like
that and ice creams
yeah they help make you fatter i don't
think that's news to anyone
and of course sugar-laden drinks help
make you fatter and less healthy as well
but fresh fruits themselves are not even
close to that so here's the
recommendation bottom line consume as
many
fresh fruits as you like if this leads
negative health you may be a subject of
a one-person study the government
experts should be looking at you all
weird because you may be the first
person to have ever ruined your health
eating fresh fruits okay
however because we learned a little
something today about refined sugars
added to the diet especially fructose i
would keep refined sugar beverages to a
minimum or to zero uh it's not a
religious thing if i see someone
drinking a glass of orange juice i'm not
thinking oh my god what an idiot uh i'm
thinking
truth be told if they're of normal
looking body composition and they seem
to be healthy i'm like well maybe their
health is fine it's okay to have glass
orange juice every now and again totally
cool
if they're on the high end of the
obesity spectrum i automatically know
that if they stopped drinking sugary
beverages they almost certainly lose a
lot of weight and improve their health
so i'm kind of like what is it there
that you're doing nothing good right
these refined sugar beverages sodas and
juices are the ones that add tons of
calories they add plenty of fructose
maybe even on the excessive end that
hurt your metabolism independently of
the weight gain
and they really cause almost no hunger
reduction whatsoever okay when you're
super hungry and you need to knock
hunger off for a while let's say you're
dieting and you have the choice between
eating three peaches or a thing of you
know orange juice or three oranges or
things of orange juice same macros same
amount of carbs
you drink a glass of orange juice 30 to
minutes to an hour later you're gonna be
like fuck i want to eat you eat three
oranges and like how you know two hours
later you're like uh i'm still digesting
them because the fiber in there
and the water content and the volume and
all those things combine to make fresh
fruit way more filling and sugary
beverages don't have that
so if someone was to ask me hey is fruit
juice healthy i would say in some
context absolutely but as a general
recommendation most people in the modern
western world especially if they
struggle with their weight probably
should be keeping fruit juice and soda
consumption to a minimum which means you
can have all the diet soda you want in
the world but regular sugar soda is
probably not that great
and
if you are trying to mass up and get
jacked
there is a propensity for fructose
especially in very high levels to be
stored a little bit more as fat and
cause some not so nice metabolic
consequences not a huge deal but a deal
so i would say it's probably good if you
want extra carbs maybe to stay a little
bit away from taking in like orange
juice with meals or something and
potentially switching to a mass gainer
shake
that has glucose or dextroses it's also
called outside of the body and
maltodextrin which breaks down into
glucose as carb sources because they're
going to give you all that anabolic push
and all of that extra calorie and
carbohydrate but minus some of that
really excessive fructose stuff on a
mass gaining phase you absolutely still
can't eat as many fruits as you like
it's the drinking it that really gets
you the high fructose dosages that cause
a concern
