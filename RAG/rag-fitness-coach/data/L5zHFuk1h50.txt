structure
and flexibility the rp diet app builds a
structure of eating that creates the
results you're looking for
but has the flexibility to let you scan
your favorite foods and follow your
preferred diet philosophy the digital
diet coach in your pocket is more
powerful than ever
so let's build a better you with the rp
diet app
our dr mike and dr james hope you guys
are at least
surviving and uh not going crazy through
this quarantine time mike i saw you got
looks like you got quite the uh home gym
going now
yeah i saw some of your posts on
instagram you want to tell everybody
like what what all
fanciful items you got yeah charlie and
i got
um so the number one reason we did the
home gym was because crustal my wife
um she needs to train and she's a doctor
so she's super busy
and she can't like you know go over to
charlie's to do
dumbbells or anything like that and we
need a place to train you know
uh body parts that just aren't covered
well for us
more advanced folks by dumbbells um
and we like so know a couple folks with
garage gyms or kind of like gyms in like
warehouses or something like that that
we
can drive to to train like legs or
something but like
some of those are like an hour away and
it's just not really you know
a great use of our time to do that so
for sure mostly for my wife but for us
as well
uh it was actually about a week and a
half ago
where you know gym started closing and
we were like okay we have to get on this
so
charlie ordered some racks
uh bench adjustable incline bench to
flat
um one of those aerobics deficit uh
platforms
about close to well actually
uh the 220 pounds in total weight and
then
uh joey uh sat mary sat strength on
youtube
we're very good friends with him we
actually just borrowed weight from his
gym because he owns a gym so we're like
you know can we just
borrow like a couple of twenty five we
rent some of your weights yeah
you know as soon as this uh quarantine
is over it's gonna bring it right back
if we need him but uh we're just buying
our own but um
he's like yeah totally so we got some
ways for him so basically we have like
around 300 pounds here
and we actually snagged a local
craigslist
pull down machine it's plate loaded it
plate loaded pull-downs are so
good they're just like platelet
everything is better than selectorize
and everything
uh because there's some more of a real
feel it's momentum or
something like that it's just awesome so
we got a plate where to pull down it's
fucking awesome
and then we've got we got this giant
tarp i had um
the roof outfitted when we bought the
place i had it outfitted with deck
furniture
and with a gazebo type thing um
and uh because like you know first of
all like if you ever want to sell a
house it's good to have that kind of
stuff because when people look at it and
they're like wow this is awesome we
could be
lounging it on the roof and the roof has
a really good view of like the whole
city of philadelphia
but like chris and i work exclusively
and we don't work we just like watch two
episodes of svu go to sleep
so we like really just don't go on the
roof almost ever so
the gazebo was doing a whole lot of
nothing so charlie got a giant giant
tarp
and uh scott the video guy actually
scott hoon helped us put the tarp
uh over and we sort of tied it down with
some rope so far it hasn't parachuted
the fucking roof away
um it's been raining it's been windy and
we've been actually able to train under
the tarp
it's hardcore today it was 45 degrees
when we were training
and like warming up is a little
interesting like we were wearing two
sweatshirts each
um and it's definitely a challenge but
once you get going you know a lot of
heat regulation is really easy when it's
45 degrees
yeah actually when it's cold to even
just touching the barbell is like a
challenge because it's fucking freezing
right you're like what
i was i was watching your videos and i
was like oh man i'm so jealous
of that that pull down uh like that's
the one thing i don't have
like i really would want in my home gym
set up like just because the
footprint's too large for our space so
just yeah
you know what i mean for now so i was
like oh that bastard you gotta pull down
uh yeah without giving it too much away
i mean i understand you guys
are looking at a new place and uh you
know there you'll have
for sure enough space i think to have a
good home
set up and then yeah i highly recommend
plate loaded pull down
super super awesome yeah and like your
boy here i'm i don't i'm not too
arrogant to say i suck at pull-ups right
maybe
because i'm weak or maybe because my
anthropometry is bad or both sure but
like man the pull-down what is like one
that i'm missing from the
gym so i was i thought it was uh really
cool to see
yeah start answering some questions here
i got them pulled up
rp plus first youtube after people are
gonna be asking you doctor mike what
should what
what pulldown did you get dr mike what
this and that did you get yeah
that's coming all right
ready to go ready khalid b says hello
doctors i hope you're safe and healthy
during this difficult time and you as
welcome
a few questions for you regarding 10rm
and intensity progression in the
mesocycle
number one if i could do 100 kilos an
exercise for 10rm i would start at 85
of 10rm uh the beginning of the meso
so i would start at 85 kilos 3rar i
would be able to do roughly 17 reps but
i would stop at 14.
the rest of measure the weight would go
85 90 95 kilos
if i have to maintain the same amount of
reps those are jumps
yeah uh yes they are if i have to
maintain the same amount of reps to
ensure rir falls in the last week i
would do 95 kilograms of 14 reps
that would mean that i have expected to
increase my performance through the meso
that's
since 95 at 14 reps is more work
than 100 kilograms at 10. uh
yes it's okay so far so far so good i'm
getting these figures from an app that
estimates my 1rm based on weights and
reps and weights okay um wouldn't that
mean that my volume through the meso was
too low
since i'm expecting expected to only
maintain performance with the mezzo well
maintain maintainers slightly rise
but a huge rise in performance probably
indicates that from a hyper
perspective you could have done more
volume instead so if that's correct if i
do
95 kilograms 12 reps for instance there
would still be more work
done than the previous week 90 kilograms
at 14
reps yeah so so here's the deal there's
a
specific question in there but yeah so
there's a there's
the real question is wouldn't that mean
my volume through the meso was low since
i am expected to only maintain
performance of the meso
yeah like so so basically what you're
doing here is you're increasing
uh vastly in your strength this is this
would be very atypical for an advanced
person
incredibly impressive for an
intermediate to go 85
90 95 kilos without losing any reps like
that's real impressive right like the
the prescribed rir progression too
that's
right bananas yeah like that's really
cool
um is he is that what he's projecting to
do or is that what he actually did
i don't know so so there's another one
the projections are tough because these
rm calculators really break down when
you get into specifics and you get into
progressions and you get into higher
reps so
it says i would be able to do roughly 17
reps i would surmise that for most
people
being able to do 17 reps of 85 kilograms
means
100 for 10 is not really where they're
at for
people that are faster twitch generally
better trained um
outside of their homeostatic range um if
you had to work to get to 100 kilos on
an exercise even just sort of start
around there
you could probably do far fewer than 17
reps of 85 kilos maybe more like 14 reps
at 85 kilos
and then your ability to maintain
85 90 90 95 your ability to maintain
that 14 reps is going to be
very highly questionable much more
realistic progression
would be 85 87.5
two five and it would be much more
realistic if you started at
you know eleven and then ended up at
eleven or twelve
then you know eleven or twelve at ninety
two point five translates pretty closely
to a hundred kilos
for 10 uh and i would say
is a little bit of an increase in
performance which is good and then once
you deloaded
uh and recycled you would see an even
bigger performance
so i just think that these are very very
optimistic numbers
uh and in the real world your
performance wouldn't go up that much but
i'll answer the full question and let
james take a hack at it if indeed this
does occur
then yes very likely you could have been
doing more volume
if you're getting that big of strength
jumps that's really kind of a strength
program and not a hypertrophy program
james yeah i agree and so uh khalid
i think might be a good alternative
while you're while you're kind of
testing the water here is like
uh regardless of what the numbers end up
being let's say you started at
85 and your goal reps was you know
between
5 and 10. i know in this example you're
using 17 and 14 but let's just say
85 kilos goals 5 to 10. you can just
stay at 85
until you're really consistently going
above
those five to ten goal reps right so
like if in three you're starting to hit
14 12 10 it's like okay well now you can
make a very good justification for going
up to 87.5 or maybe 90 because
the weights clearly not uh
putting you in gold rep range that you
want so i mean sometimes
these programs increases is helpful but
i think
you know this is that auto regulation
comes in where you just look at your
performance
see how it's going is it where you
expect to be yes okay stay the course
is it uh better or worse than what you
expected it to be
okay now it's justifications for change
and in this case a positive change would
be
oh i get to put more weight on the bar
because i'm getting stronger great okay
i'm just going to go up a little bit
this week and see where i
ended and go from there so i don't think
you need to think about necessarily
having such linear
you know pre-planned versions yeah
at least intensity
yep number two due to gym closures
i bought a bench and a set of heavy dumb
adjustable dumbbells i was in week one
of mesotube but decided to start
metabolic phases i should
be able to do most exercises that way
i'm doing 20 to 30 reps on electro sizes
should i change our ar progression since
the wraps are a bit higher uh doing one
rar week one instead of three
and for strength should i expect a
strength increases in the 8 to 12 rep
ranges after the metabolite phase
or the reps too high to produce strength
increases in the rep range so you're
gonna produce a lot of so it's a
two-part answer
um should you increase the rer from uh
one in week one to three
i think if you're a relatively
well-trained person which you probably
are and your adults are relatively heavy
you set a set of heavy adjustable
dumbbells i think you might be able to
start a two rer not exactly one i think
one is like a
bit fresh for beginners intermediates we
usually say for at home programs with
light dumbbells you can start at one rar
or even zero rer
but for more advanced folks and you know
support who rb plus is really for
i think starting at two ir instead of
three or four is really probably a good
way to go and remember like if it's not
sufficiently disruptive
uh to you the next week you can go
further right it's always like
but starting is is by almost by
definition a conservative enterprise
and then uh should you expect strength
increases in each 12 rep range
so you should expect muscle increases
which will later transfer to strength
but the repetitions of 20 to 30 reps are
so
neurologically and bioenergetically
different that it's going to adapt you
to them
and probably cost you if you're anything
above an intermediate
you may see no increase in tall 8 to 12
rep strength a little bit of an increase
or actually a decrease in strength it
will later become a huge increase but
it's going to take weeks and weeks and
weeks to transition
james and i learned this a painful hard
way when we thought that like doing sets
of 15 to 20 would like convert
to like sets of five and it just all of
a sudden you're you hit like 25 pounds
under your pr set of five
like how did i get weaker when i'm
clearly more jacked
and then weeks weeks weeks later you're
like oh that's
a very very different movement james
what do you think yeah you nailed it i
totally agree
all right sweet number three i just
finished day two of the metabolite phase
and i'm in fact
more sore i like how he's like should i
begin metabolize phase anyway just
finished day two
um i just uh finished day two of the
metabolic phase and i'm in fact more
sore than week one of a regular meso hey
hopefully you didn't do one rir it just
did too it looks like maybe you did
is it probably due to a combination you
just probably did a combination in
exercise higher up shorter rust and the
fact that i haven't really trained
last two weeks as i was waiting for the
equipment i mean that last one was
overwhelmingly the fact
yeah the last point this got me
wondering prior to joining rp i used to
do a bro split one x a week or muscle
group i would get sore two to three days
but work um but would only work that
muscle again a week later now i need to
be much more diligent on monitoring
soreness and recovery given higher
frequency on monday
it was an upper body day with a chest
focused at 11 sets of chest started
getting doms tuesday now it's wednesday
and i'm still sore assuming the
performance is the same when training a
muscle group every three days
should i add sets if the soreness only
fully goes away uh the same day when i'm
training the muscle group before
the muscle group again or or is that
zero um
uh i don't know what you mean by zero
maybe he's talking about the fbt rating
scale but
yes you should only add sets if the
training
you did last time soreness is completely
gone when you do it again
um i think it's worth noting too in this
example like the
your week one on this one's probably
going to be a wash in terms of being
able to
use that information a good a you had
like two weeks off and b
you switched to the mezzo which is like
already gonna be kind of yeah so you got
two things two
really like uh variation that's gonna
negatively affect so i'll be just train
this week see how it goes maybe back
down a little bit for this first week
getting really and then use your two
numbers as like a good
new star baseline in terms of going up
or down because having been off for that
long like you're just going to be
radically sore
what you do so it's kind of hard to say
yeah but definitely don't
increase go again
with the same thing even in that
instance right james like
do do a repeat of we won for week two
yeah and then
evaluate again yeah he says i know for
instance if i completely heal the day
before
training the muscle group again it's a
one uh that's not the case
um your performance has to also be good
for it to be a one
um and if soreness overlaps the next
session it's probably negative one or a
zero
maybe probably negative one but also
depends on your performance
assuming performance is the same but
what about completely healing on the
same day
so i don't know what you mean by the
same day but do you mean right before
the session
um or do you mean like the same day but
after the session is over
uh i think that if you are sore when you
have to train again
you either don't increase volume or
reduce volume
reduce volume if it was perceived as
incredibly difficult and your
performance is
faltering and definitely decrease volume
or if you're incredibly sore and you
don't heal for several days after
and if you're a little bit sore the day
of it's a zero
if you're not sore at all and your
performance is
decent but it was pretty tough zero and
if your performance was really good
like you're like oh this wasn't that
hard at all and you were completely
healed then it's a plus one
number four i want to incorporate a bit
of strength work for compounds into my
mesocycles going forward around six reps
would you recommend starting at 102
percent of my channel ram that would
yield roughly six reps on the first set
with three rr week one
i would then keep the reps the same but
progress the weight so like the
percentages of one arm are really hugely
individual
of where your reps would fall i would
say experiment warm up
and see what is a tough six reps and
start there and then i'll regulate after
that
because it could be very different based
on different exercise
different individuals and and different
rep range too so it's like hard to scale
um a rep range from another rep range in
many cases so i would yeah
mike said um so it's like okay well i'm
using 10 rm a better way would be to use
your
you know a better way would be to use
your three by six rm
right but if you five hours yeah yeah
uh so i just guess and check at that
point auto regulate
number five my last question involves
rest times on most isolation exercises i
get 60 to 90 seconds on motorcycles one
and two
and half of that motorcycle three that's
a metallic motorcycle
uh what i'm doing now i find this gives
a nice bump for belts and arms
when the rest times are short however
doing so means that my later sets are
impacted
i could do more reps if i rest longer
would you recommend keeping the rest
times the same
to go for the pump effect or rest a bit
longer do more reps and messes 102.
uh i was distracted between this and the
last question so
like i had a red flag pop up so um if
you're doing a metabolite phase
i would actually go back to question
four and i would consider
not doing like specific strength
training at all it's like we're getting
a little
hodgepodge of stuff i understand like
going a little bit heavy in the
hypertrophy range and keeping some like
six to ten work in there
if that's what we're talking about okay
i'm with you but if we're talking about
like
strength strength that's not a good plan
right also let's start
i think he means like probably when he
gets his uh gym membership back because
like with dumbbells you need to do
sex yeah yeah if i start resting longer
on those exercises would that violate
the progressive overall principle no
i.e i'm doing roughly the same sense for
the same weight maybe a few more reps
but i'm resting longer so the reps just
tend to cancel out
and sometimes even the um so the reps
and sets tend to cancel out so basically
like
uh it's been shown pretty clearly now
especially with james krieger's reviews
that
if you rest very short you have to do
more sets to get the same effect
if you rest very long you have to do
fewer sets to get the same effect but
you have to rest longer so it ends up
taking about the same time anyway
um this is your call which is where you
want to go i would just say keep a
consistent mesoderm as well
and what i would also say is there's a
rest time algorithm that we use
at rp and if you go into rp hypertrophy
guide central hub
and you click on any one of the articles
about any muscle group
in rest times it's got an exact
algorithm of how to figure your rest
times i would just follow that because
that's really the best way to go
and what that really just dials you into
is like you rest
until the target muscle is going to be
the limiting factor right and when
that's the case
you get the most out of every set and
resting any longer probably won't have a
very big benefit of any at all
but if you rest shorter than that you
will have to do more sets to get the
same effect
and that's totally fine if you want to
do that if you want to get a little bit
more
burn going and work quickly some people
just don't like resting that's totally
fine they will have to do more sense
in order to get the same effect and the
last thing is how do you know you have
to do more sets to get the same effect
well
you gauge how much of a
pump you have at some point during the
workout so for example if you take
really quick rest breaks
you do four sets like you're heating and
hoeing like you're huffing and puffing a
lot
but your pump locally at the muscle
might not be as impressive as you
thought
but if you rest longer each set is
really tough gets you way more reps and
the pump could be
gnarlier in addition you can perceive
the degree of muscle disruption
like if you rest very little between
bicep curls and you do four sets
someone's like how your biceps you're
like
they feel kind of pretty fine just i
don't know just sort of run through that
where if you rest longer you could
really knock your biceps out and you're
like holy fuck my
shit is off like my strength feels weird
contractility is weird
then lastly likes the degree of soreness
right after the workout and then into
the late onset
like if you take very short rest times a
lot of times you just won't get a sore
from four sets as you were when you were
taking log arrest
because each set is higher quality so
you can auto regulate that anyway
uh but i would say just don't ever
really go again
if your breathing or other muscles or
your central fatigue is a limiting
factor
is a pretty good guide for how to trade
because
otherwise you're just like sort of
willfully doing much more junk volume
than you need to
james yeah that was a really good
explanation this is
those instances in spring exercise time
i think it's really funny
where it's kind of a walk where it's
like pick one pick one that works for
you
and it's we really do like really simple
things for complex reasons you know and
so it's always the answers are typically
like
kind of no-brainers and seem like common
sense just like this is like
duh type answer just like pick one and
be consistent um
but there's a lot of like really
complicated reasons why that is true and
there's many things in our field
which kind of fall into that where it's
like train hard like
okay there's so much that goes into
training hard but at the end of the day
it's like okay well you just gotta make
sure you put in a reasonable print
you're probably gonna get what you want
like
you know like it's just one of those
things i think it's really funny
where it's like okay you can take
shorter rest or longer rests are a big
spectrum in between and you're it's
mostly equipment
you won't get away from the work that's
the real fast thorough kicker
yeah exactly all right daniel hacker
says i'm considering making a bit of
change in my macro cycle i'd like your
guys opinions initially i planned three
measures of mass
mini cut than two miles of mass about to
finish my third meso of mass but i'm not
too fat
started massing at one uh 91 at the
moment 207
now i think instead of taking a mini cut
i'll instead do a three or four week
maintenance phase
if there's higher body weight and then
do two more muscles of masking gaining
0.5 to 1 pound per week
then maintain again and go into a cut i
think this is a good idea no
i don't uh personally i just don't see a
need to mini cut currently as i'm not
over fat but i know that the volume of
sensitization after three mass muscles
is probably a productive idea
i think with a mini cut you can get a
good deal of volume resensitization and
get a little leaner
being too lean is not really unless
you're like really a super lean when you
have veins and you're starving all the
time
being too lean is not really a really
bad problem to have daniel
and i would say take the mini cut anyway
maybe shorten the duration
um maybe shorten the aggressiveness of
it but i would say losing a little bit
of fat can just make the
rest of your massing go super well and
also at the end of those two messes of
mass
you'll be way less fat than you thought
you were going to be and you're going to
be thanking yourself for it
then the successive cut you're going to
have after doesn't need to be as long
you can get back to massing quicker or
the cut can be just as long
and then can get you to a really nutsoid
lean level you never thought you could
take it from someone who's over masked a
whole lot during his life and gotten way
too fat
if you're sitting pretty and nice and
lean uh
take it and run with it man and keep it
instead of just being like fuck it like
i'm just going to maintain
like it and you know because you're
going to mass again anyway
i would say a maintenance phase you know
is good anyway but after those two
massing phases right now i would say
maybe make your mini cut not as strict
or not as long but still take it because
you could be in a really good place
james yeah i agree with mike so the
question is kind of like what what's the
advantage of just taking the maintenance
phase over the mini cut where they both
kind of have the same
uh volume sensitizing effect the mini
cut has the added benefit of keeping
your body composition at a good place
um the only real benefit i could see to
doing the maintenance
phase is like when you're just
psychologically just like fuck they
don't care anymore but at that point
you're probably not going to mass again
anyway you know what i mean so it's kind
of like
if you're in between masses and you're
in a good psychological state
i would lean towards minico unless
there's something here as to why you
would want to do the maintenance phase
blue of that i'm just not sure other
than that
yeah if you have a barbell and plates
do you think a what do you think of a
deficit rdl is a good lighter
option for hams in the training week as
heavier rdls are
done early in the week i live alone so
doing isometric partner leg curls or
aura curls are kind of out i'm thinking
either b stance rdl deficient rdl one to
three inches in 10 to 15 rep range
or lying wheel drag curls lay down heels
on a shirt
uh and curl my legs to my butt with a
top
pause uh which do you guys think is best
or are they
all or they all work and it doesn't
matter totally cool with that answer
um what's next that's when you like put
one leg out one leg back so you can
focus on one hand at a time
like a single leg version yeah oh i just
never heard it called that before okay
yeah yeah the b stance rdl's are cool
except they take forever because you
have to do each hand by itself
definite real is awesome if you have the
flexibility and if your hamstrings are
still the limiting factor because some
people like
that just turns into lower back
exercises and most people will start
cheating with their upper body too where
they just roll down instead of
hinging down yep uh lying heel drag
curls are actually really sweet if you
have dumbbells that are round
uh or if they have like uh one of those
adjustable dumbbells you can use that
dumbbell or if you have a barbell at
home of any kind
uh then you can uh do those
uh heel drags with a barbell and load
various weights onto it and
that's really uh really tough so um
i think those are all really good these
stance takes a long time deficit rdl has
its limit so if you can do deficient or
yellows they're definitely a great
choice
i would say that the lying heel drag
curls are great because also they're
biomechanically a little bit different
and they use if you do like two
different kinds of rdls it's really very
low variation
and the uh hamstring uh function of
curling the leg
in is actually a slightly different
musculature than the hip extension
so i think the lying heel drag curls are
my personal vote for what you should do
now
at home and but uh totally cool with
everything else james
yeah i i think that's a great choice i
would lean towards more
more towards the single leg sldl but a
lot of people
don't tolerate doing hip hinging twice a
week like really hard hip hinging
like barbell dumbbell hinging versus
like a 45 degree background something
that's kind of what i mean so some
people don't tolerate that very well and
in that case
if you're one of those people uh i think
the the leg curl option is probably
better
if you're somebody like me and you are
very responsive to hip hinge uh
i would do it that way but i don't think
your option is bad necessarily i think
they're both good
yeah great great sam schneider says hey
dr j
dr m endurance guy here again thank you
for recommendations last week regarding
leg training sissy squats and increase
in my mind muscle connection
has not been significantly decreased
large number of and sets of leg training
i've also started taking a wildly
unreasonable dose of viagra before
training to get that nasty pump polo jk
i was like really oh it's a bad idea i
have a few random hypertrophy slashing
drones questions
are there any hypertrophy strategies
that might preserve endurance
adaptations outside of limiting muscle
loss
during injury slash time off or are they
mostly unrelated i had knee injury that
prevented me from running biking that
didn't inhibited me for doing mercury
training i would say
hypertrophy training with um compound
alternating supersets
is a real good uh idea there because it
keeps your central
um endurance systems firing a little bit
harder than normal
and it will allow you to return to play
easier and anything done with higher
repetitions while doing that is also a
good idea james
so and yeah i i think that's a good
suggestion however i do
i just want to point out that like when
you stop doing your endurance training
methods like your specific car audio
training
you will start deconditioning within
like a week week and a half if you're
not doing that specific type of training
it's one of those things that does start
deconditioning immediately if you're not
stimulating it
and you can preserve some of those
characteristics through weight training
and kind of like cross-training hybrid
kind of crossfitting type training
you can however just keep in mind like
once you stop running or cycling
you're going to immediately start
de-conditioning those things so at that
point it's a matter of like
minimizing loss rather than complete
preservation because you will not be
able to preserve it unless you do
something
so much of it goes uh just from the
local mechanics so you have like
peripheral factors and you have central
facts all of which are de-conditioning
at the same time so it's just one of
those things like
stop cycling it's just gonna suck the
next time you get back to cycling and so
there are some things you can do to
mitigate that like trying to keep
a higher rate workload but
it's just going to decondition and i'm
not really sure if there's anything
i'm think of trying to think of anything
off top of my head but i can't really
think of anything that can help you
deal with that outside of just finding
alternative cardiovascular
modalities so um you could do anything
like the uh uh
uh rowing ergometer you could do armor
gutter you could do
uh uh elliptical might be an option
depending on the knee situation like
those crossfit type stuff
in the in the in the weight training
realm for really high reps compound
movements for high reps
alternating with each other can really
tax you centrally nothing like your
endurance training would but some
it would definitely be easier to get
back yeah so finding an alternative
cardio modality will at least preserve
some of the central and you'll lose some
of the peripheral but it will come back
quickly once you start training again so
instead of losing two you only lose one
and not a huge deal
yep yep all right
question two weight training legs for
cycling is commonly done in the
off-season increased power on the bike
in terms of squatting
when i induce larger and more
transferable adaptations to my bike
providing power if i were to squat to
the 10 rep ranges versus 10 to 30.
would it be more advantageous to
progress load on the bar overall
capacity number of
slash reps at the same weight james yeah
so this uh
people tend to think of strength
training for cycling as this like weird
completely different than everything
else outside of the normal expected
realm of adaptations and unfortunately
that's not true
so you should do weight training for
cycling all the time uh minus
like very specific peaking and taper
protocols where you might take it out
just to have a good performance
so you what we recommend is that uh for
cycling especially if you're doing like
pill downhill doing like mountain or
hilly terrain uh you definitely want to
have periods where you're doing that 10
to 30 kind of rep range and really
building a lot of work capacity and
tolerance to
intense uh training but you actually
want to start periodizing your way down
as you get closer to competitions and
actually including the strength
characteristics so you might actually
start seeing yourself
of you know like five to ten four to
eight
one to five and really getting big big
strong quads and uh using things like
hybrid squats and leg presses
i actually had a did a little spent on
this a little while ago
one of the big goals for increasing your
power output and cycling is just getting
stronger and that means being stronger
on the bike but also just having generic
uh
quadriceps transfer training effects and
the way that you do that is by getting
really really good at squatting
really really good at leg pressing leg
pressing is a great option for cycling
because you don't have the kinetic chain
limitations
that other sports do so normally if it's
like a football player a rugby player
soccer player
we'd say focus on something like
squatting because it's going to have
better transfer of training effects
because of the kinetic chain
cycling you don't really have to support
yourself up right against the world
just to sit on the bike and push really
hard so leg press is a really great
option for loading
those quadriceps in a really heavy
strong waist so i would actually think
about
periodizing like a traditional sport in
that regard with the
training where you're going from higher
reps to incrementally lower reps and
really building up your strength in
those quads
great answer nothing and
the source that arrived from a long
slash hard ll viagra sorry dan the bike
feels different
boner jokes feels different than
the soreness i achieve after a brutal
end of a leg workout
is this solely due to the fact that i'm
taxing different types of muscle fibers
or are they sustaining different types
of damage
uh probably both man probably both but
certainly um you would be in a very
prime position
and a lot of people aren't in this
position and they sort of just just
weight train or
just do endurance and then they can't
speak to this matter accurately
but since you do both you'll be able to
perceive it and speak to the fact that
soreness from hypertrophy work feels
considerably different than soreness
from
endurance work and the soreness from
journalists work in my view
is is a lot of times centered more
around the joints and distal areas
is a bit more diffuse it's kind of like
not this owl like ooh like my
oh my quads like you push on your quads
like out there they really hurt
it's like this sort of diffuse soreness
that's kind of like it's like a like a
like a direct damage kind of crinkle
when you open your quads up and close
them like you move your legs like ah
and it kind of doesn't feel great it's
not this deep
deep soreness that doms typically is
after retraining
one of those probably has correlates
tanker trophy and one probably just
does not at all or very close to not so
there's definitely something there
that's different for sure yeah
i agree and i think in the muscle level
it's um you get a lot more
like metabolic type damage and soreness
that you see in something like cycling
rather than something like lifting where
you just accrued
an incredible amount of byproducts for
the last you know two hours while you
were working
and it's uh taking its toll so it's very
similar if you've ever done like um
occlusion training and you were like why
am i so radically
sore well it's because you've been
accumulated throughout that workout and
it's
wreaking havoc on you so same idea
lastly i was wondering about the main
driver of vascularity dr mice claude's
large and vanilla while i need to stop
yet uh so are the quads of many
professional cyclists
does the vascular look solely produced
by muscle size or increase the need for
blood capillary density cyclist quads
and mic squads
are good at very different things any
recommendations techniques outside of
getting lean and improving muscularity
but it's something that just comes with
time and training if you're wondering
about the odd origins of this question
my cyclist twin brother
now has a few veins showing on his quads
and likes to show them off hold them
over me
when we are together the only logical
reasonable response i can think of is to
achieve a frank mcgrath level of
vascularity aka
veins like bungee cords right quads we
appreciate your time sam so sam i'll
tell you what i know about vascularity
i'll tell you what i don't
i know the capillaries can grow but i i
don't know that
large uh physically visible structures
uh
like arteries arterials can actually
grow anew i don't
i don't think that's the case i suspect
it's not
but maybe um in addition to that
uh the huge huge fraction of uh
vascularity
is genetic and that's not really
actually vascularity we need to be very
clear what we're talking about we're
talking about externally visible
masculinity
everyone has a very similar degree of
vascularity in their muscles and around
them but
you know this is just surface
vascularity in the skin so it's a lot of
genetics and then number one factor is
for sure leanness
that leanness doesn't account for
everything so you know jay cutler's
physique
was actually very not vascular
surprisingly and uh
people that were as lean or not even as
lead
frank mcgrath was way more vascular i
don't believe frank mcgrath
you know he got probably as lean as j
color but certainly no leader and he's
way way
more vascular so a lot of its genetics a
lot of us just
i'll talk about surface vascularity i
think that i don't know how training
affects vascularity in a visible sense
i've been getting steadily more vascular
but also it gets consistently more lean
and as my individual muscles get bigger
i get more vascular because they push up
against the skin
more now am i growing new veins i
fucking really highly doubt macro
structures grow
but i do believe that uh getting
incrementally leaner and bigger
is the number one way to express your
genetic vascularity and beyond that i
don't think there's anything that can be
done
james yeah i agree and like angiogenesis
does occur to some degree but as mike
was saying it's on such a deep
not at level you just there's no way
that you would even
ever be aware that it's occurring right
so the things that you see
are your structures that are just
popping up a little bit more either
through having a bigger muscle or a
lower body fat um the training that you
do in cycling
will trigger angiogenesis to some very
minute degree but that's going to be
like a
capillary type level things that you
just would not be able to see or
it wouldn't be sticking out through your
your arms or your legs you know what i
mean so
uh a lot of that is just uh doing your
normal endurance training
and that's just the thing so it's kind
of like how do you train for hyperplasia
it's like wow you just you just kind of
do hypertrophy training and
if you're lucky it happens and if you're
not lucky then it doesn't really matter
anyways so just kind of do your normal
thing
go for it for sure all right harrison
catan
says hello mike and james thanks for
your advice for a couple weeks ago
how to address the misnomer of getting
uh bulky from lifting weights with women
i talked to my girlfriend and got a
clear picture of her goals and was able
to dissuade
her of the thought that lifting heavier
or in a bodybuilding sort of way
will quickly make her look bulky or
unfeminine dr james i even inserted the
hot dog look description
yes in there too when i brought it up
with fat loss and what's necessary to
maintain muscle mass it worked great so
thanks again
i'm glad that could help always a winner
nobody wants that work in addition i did
eat during my last competition just
wanted to skip the minutiae of listing
everything out well thank you
oh okay yeah i remember last week we
were like did this guy just eat
breakfast and then not eat the
day i remember now now the actual
questions when it comes to mrv i've
heard it described by juggernaut that
you could have a squad on mrv benjamin
deadlift mrv
could you go in depth about the
crossover mrv for squatting
for quads affecting the back and
deadlifting for back perfecting the
quads how much does one affect the other
and would you take away sets from
one lift as you increase another in a
given week so
now those are a couple of different
questions there um could you go in depth
about the crossover of mrv
of squatting for quads affecting the
back and deadlifting for back affecting
the quads
so the direct effect of deadlifting um
uh it doesn't affect the quads much
directly the actual quads but it does
affect your squatting murphy because the
squat is
involved in two capacities across
current with the deadlift
three one local fatigue of uh the spinal
erection musculature there you go who's
who is our last person that asked all
those questions
more boners schneider hope you uh hung
around to hear that one
go hung around that was that was very
good oh
that sounds pretty good so posterior
chain posterior yeah
everything's dicks everything's dicks my
life summarized
so um basically
you've got uh a thing where number one
the local musculature of the posterior
chain
including the glutes hamstrings and back
is uh you know hit by quads uh hit by
squatting and hit by dumbledore so
there's some cross current there the
next thing is axial fatigue the fatigue
of
having to have your spine compressed
definitely affected by both
and then um lastly is the fatigue
so honorable mention is quad fatigue but
really the quads are so minimally
involved
in a proper deadlift unless you're doing
sumo and then there's some involvement
that quads and
glutes and adductors can actually
intersect but with conventional little
things very very minimal
uh and then lastly is systemic fatigue
because both of those are very
systemically fatiguing and one costs the
other
a lot just because they cost everything
right
so um so there is that interaction
and benching interacts by both also if
you do a proper arch
beating up your back and a systemic
fatigue uh there's cross
uh cross transmitted as well and then
your next question is how much does one
affect the other
so it depends it depends on your mrvs
individually it depends on your recovery
abilities
so for example if you're training like
way below your mrv and you just happen
to have a really gnarly mrv for your
posterior chain
your limiting factor on squatting is
your quads and your deadlifts just not
that high
um and let's say even like your
deadlift's not that high because your
back's not that strong
uh but it's your backs are really good
at wraps and doesn't really fatigue much
and also you're very well leveraged for
the deadlift if there's going to be a
very minimal effect from one to the
other
on the other hand if you're poorly
leveraged deadlift which means you have
to sink lower to deadlift
if your back is very fast twitch um and
takes a lot of fatigue and doesn't
recover very quickly
uh and if you're a very heavy squatter
and very heavy deadlifter
that could end up being a huge huge uh
counter current
uh and a massive interactive effect how
do you know
is you begin like well this is like
james and i like
white flag we fly into every battle is
begin the program with conservative
assumptions
monitor your volume landmarks based on
performance like your body will
tell you if you're doing too much of one
or two much of the other so slowly
titrate them both
up and find out where you know they
start to interfere
and then try to stop titrating one up
and just titrate the other one up to see
how much breathing room it buys you or a
new mesocycle later
try to cut your deadlift volume in half
and see how much more squatting volume
that buys you and the other way around
and the last question is would you take
away sets from one lift as you increase
another in a given week
in a given mesocycle yes in a given week
probably not
chad wesley smith has very advanced
programming where he like
peaks the squat twice in a four or five
week mezzo and peaks the deadlift once
on the bench three times
and he peaks them all certainly during
different times super advanced
um and and for most folks that would be
it works great but it's
sort of like pretty complex for most
folks to pull off and it'd be a lot of
assumptions it's something i would
reserve for someone like chad or max
aida to do for you as
excellent of coaches as they are but i
would say that
even in their case most cycles have a
priority like if you're prioritizing
your squat definitely reduce the
deadlift but then it's reduced in pretty
much
all weeks but if you want to have some
weeks that are more qua
more deadlift or more squat oriented
that should be a pre-planned strategy
that you implement
not like oh man my deadlift really beat
me up this week i'll squat less next
week it should be a planned thing where
i know i'm peeking my squat next week so
i'm going to do a bit more squatting
next week and a bit less time lifting
this week so on and so on
james it becomes like more obvious too
when you have uh
like just some lists that are like
disproportionately strong for you so for
this is like a classic example it's like
if you're a really strong deadlifter
you will find that like you will hit a
really good life session and it'll
actually just wipe you out systemic mrv
wise
for all the rest of your sessions we're
just like oh i just hit like a huge
deadlift pr but i can't
do dick for bench or for squat or for
anything else for that matter i'm just
fucked
right or you could be like a really
strong low bar squatter and even just
holding that low part
position fucks your shoulders and your
elbows to the point where you can't
bench you're just like i just literally
can't bench for two weeks now because
holding you know 600 pounds like in that
position just fucks me over so
um there's local factors in their
systemic factors all of them interact
and you can't dial one up without taking
something else away so there is always a
balance that you have to strike
and usually for like mike was a little
once you hit that intermediate level
status if you really want to make
progress on
one of those lifts if you're like a
power lifter for example uh sometimes
you have to do more specialization
phases where you say okay
i'm going to take my squat and my
deadlifts down to mv i'm going to make
sure my technique stays crip
crisp i'm not going to lose any muscle
mass but i'm going to do a lot more
benching that means not only more sets
of bench but maybe even more frequency
maybe i'm mention
instead of two times a week now i'm
doing maybe three or three and a half
times a week just to really increase
what i can do so those are all
very viable options um
i want to quote you oh boy i probably
said something by accident
you said um
your technique stays crip
crip which means like instead of blood
your technique is cripped out
it's like blue it like shoots people or
whatever maybe that was an accident
maybe i was given like a little
little winky face to my homies here in
l.a
all right great answer let's move on to
the next very very related question
i found that i need a large number of
sets to hit mrv for my quads however
high bar low bar and front squats all
from my lower back faster than my quads
and my lower back becomes a limiting
factor
in addition i rarely get bombs in my
quads anymore but my lower back have
severe knobs from what seems to
uh from what seems necessary to make our
quads feel uh uh
used if i may mainly use squats because
of this what advice would you give for
exercise selection
so this is one of those uh questions in
exercise and sport science which has
like a really awesome
definitive clear and well established
answer and it's not really controversial
here it is this is literally why leg
presses hack squats and leg extensions
have their number one function i would
add to that like something like walking
lunges
or bulgarian split squats uh rear foot
elevated squats
also good candidates but i would go to
the hack spots and leg process first
because legitimately that is where they
come in super fucking handy you know all
those people say like all you need to
grow huge legs of squats and milk
they they have never been 250 pounds or
under the problem of your back mrv is
way lower than your quantum rv
and you can't just drink milk all the
time because you just shit blood at some
point
you actually need to eat real food which
is like no one ever actually super
jacked got there with just squats and
milk
they probably did some leg presses and
ate some rice and chicken as well
so it's one of those like real world
things where it's not hardcore to say
you should use
squats and or you know machines but that
really is where machines come in super
super handy
i just had like a daydreamer some jack
guy just like in a heated
argument with somebody like i can't just
drink milk all the time
get out of my room dad dad another one
um
all those are great suggestions and then
i would also add if you have access to
like a proper
belt squat machine probably really right
good
good particularly but all those other
ones are great too
basically they're just ways to train
legs that minimize reduce
reduce minimize or eliminate uh axial
loading and lower back involvement which
is
[Applause]
[Music]
i work hard for my results and i need my
diet dialed in
the rp diet app tells me what to eat to
keep me on track
and offer suggestions for changes based
on my responses
giving me the freedom to choose my path
a personal digital
diet coach for less than 15 a month yeah
that works
without getting into too much detail
charlie and i have made an arrangement
with uh
someone who for the time will remain
nameless that we actually bought some
gym equipment
for his warehouse area and we're going
to try to set up some leg training there
during this whole thing and eventually
that will serve as a really good gym
for the area uh but like we basically
bought a hack squat
full stop and before then we went
you know to this guy's uh sort of
warehouse
situation and did just squats
and we had a whole heavy leg workout
with only squats
james we did six sets of squats
two ultra heavy two pretty heavy
and then two still sort of heavy the
highest reps in the workout was
eight and it was like i know where this
is going i believe
i've seen those days before those are
that's a rough day at the office
it's rough and then at the end of it
it's like oh man that was tough and like
we're like yeah like
how much do your quads feel it like and
it's like
we're doing full completely high bar
pause squats
and it's like even still without our
hack spots and leg presses we're like
god damn the the sfo
charlie and i literally left and we're
driving back like the stimulus to
fatigue ratio on that workout
sucked the raw stimulus was great but it
took heaven and earth of fatigue
and i was like this is bullshit yeah
fuck it we the hack squat is already in
the mail at this point we're like
dammit when's that thing going to show
up the two down set
day is like you know that's going to be
a bad day
yeah the two the two downset workloads
yeah well that'll be a cool item to have
at your uh
at your disposal yeah man for sure
so good all right erno toy finance
says hi mr doctors number one uh
i might be going to a quote-unquote
forced vacation without pay
soon because of the wuhan virus don't
worry about me since i'm financially
well off winky face anyway i was
thinking about using this to my
advantage i'm currently doing four time
week at pt on the first
item on the first meso close to the end
can i jump to five times a week mpt on
the next measure or metabolic meso
um if i wait until the metabolic measure
i might
waste many weeks of good no stressful
recovery time i guess
this vacation will last one or three
months if if it even happens
well so so one cautionary opinion
and then um and then an answering to
your question i think i think it's
absolutely a fine idea if you have tons
of free time developing to go up and
increase frequency
but a cautionary thing is uh i sure hope
they don't close the gyms where you are
slash do you have a home gym
because if then we would say purchase
our
at-home templates instead of the mpt
and they're actually way cheaper um
because
that just might be a thing so so i would
say definitely don't i would not
it's crazy that this advice literally
doesn't give james and i as much money
as we could have if we gave you the
opposite advice but we're
the way we do things at rp is we're
truthful first and then if you still
like our products then you can buy them
we're never going to sell you anything
that you don't need don't buy the
five-week mpt yet just don't do it man
and see how your political situation
i'm going to continue to assume that you
are finished that may not be correct
but if you're in finland and they sort
of haven't done any gym
closings yet but they may do them ah you
don't want a thing
you know because here's the thing like
once they open up the gyms your vacation
will be over too and then you'll have
this
thing that's useless so i wouldn't buy
it yet
yeah those are definitely good points i
think like the notion of increasing
frequency if you have the opportunity is
good
um but yeah you have to factor that in
with the
the political climate and your current
situation so i think that was a good
good caution by dr mike
there yeah number two related above i
was thinking another option
would be to do four times a week but
instead split the workouts at least most
of them to two workouts a day so like
six to eight times a week
uh to the gym with three whole rest days
which one you would recommend five days
a week versus four workout days a week
with one to two workouts per day
um man i think this number two is
actually
a safer option in the current climate
jane
so like if you have the gym access for
sure then i would go to the five day
that's that would be
for me um if you are not sure then you
could experiment with
four times uh with double sessions that
would be like a safer
bet um so i'm not sure it really would
depend on if you have like a consistent
gym
access situation uh
and then he said edit after watching
previous webinars i will choose five
times a week to get more volume for my
non-responder body
yeah like james said that's probably the
better advice but again be careful
about making choices on this kind of
time number three about the physique
templates the algorithm increases load
on the bar slowly week by week what if
my strength gains don't go up
as fast or at all meaning the first set
i could do
95 times 10 3r next week 97.5 times 10
3r
next week 100 by 10 to rer next week
102.5
by nine two rer next week 105 by eight
to our ir etc
can i just increase the weight by how i
feel basically only increasing weight
when i know i can have my target
rep range bigger weight yes absolutely
james actually made that answer earlier
to another question that's totally fine
um honestly like that's a really great
question and the answer for why the
template's designed the way it is
it's a template like it just gives the
average the template design for someone
who basically knows almost nothing and
cares to know almost nothing
to just open it and start working out
and takes care of everything
like you know someone who's not as
advanced of a thinker as you or anyone
at rp plus
you'd be like hey so what do you think
you should go up by like two point five
percent or
or one percent or three he'd be like
what go up by what kind i just do what
the fuck the template says
so that's why it is the way it is but
it's not like some kind of golden rule
we have to go up by the amounts
you're absolutely making the correct
decision by adjusting it
and then he says on the example lift i
would increase the weight only after
when i get 11 or more reps on the first
set that's totally fine that's a fine
way to go about it
not doing anything about it though is
totally fine too because if your reps
drop
as long as it's not precipitous and your
weight increases your reps drop sort of
linearly
means that you're not actually showing a
reduction in performance that's totally
fine too but if you prefer
if you for example get a better mind
muscle connection or a better pump when
the reps stay above 10
and when they dip below into the eights
it's not as good anymore then for sure
you should wait uh and let your reps
drift up instead of putting weight on
the bar
yeah and just like a little personal
anecdote i mean this is something i wish
i would have known
maybe like 10 years ago because i can't
tell you how much
how many mesocycles and how much time
i've spent training
needlessly trying to ramp up the
intensity
yeah non-strength for non-strength
outcomes you know it was like
it was the tip i think what most people
do and i made the same mistakes everyone
else does right where you're like
i'm tr i want hypertrophy but in the
back of your mind you're like but i also
want to be strong
so i'm trying to weight on the bar all
the time and it's like i wish i just
would have picked one
and known that i could just do the most
of my mesocycles
i might have one weight increase on most
lifts sometimes if it's going
particularly well i might have two and
i'm like well cool i got really strong
on this one movement but that's usually
when it's a new movement so then i'm
like ah
doesn't even count um so you know what i
mean so it's like uh for me
that's something that's made my training
a lot better is just not needlessly
ramping up
the intensity all the time and ramping
it up only when i've decided that i need
to and i usually use something like a
goal rep range
or something else along those lines to
help me figure that out or ir for
example so
don't needlessly uh the template is you
know meant as mike said for
people to just kind of jump and start
but if it's pushing the weight up too
fast for you there's no need to continue
going up you can just keep it at the
same weight as you did last week
yeah yeah some of my best training that
i've ever done and
something i credit to a really huge
growth of my shoulders in the last two
years
is um increasing reps like i'll keep the
same weight for
two mezzos in a row yeah and slowly add
a rep
sometimes not at a rep sometimes not and
all of a sudden i'm like
doing for 18 reps what i used to do for
10. i mean
you cannot have the same muscle size and
do that
like if someone who is already well
trained
takes their rep you know their lateral
raise reps
the you know the 50s from 10 to the 50s
for 18.
they gain size you know this is not
there's no motor learning in the world
that can take a
trained athlete and put that much
fucking wrapping with it so
totally agree yeah so don't don't let
the ego
get to you in that regard like it's
perfectly okay if you're trying to get
more muscular don't worry about that
intensity progression at least
in terms of weight on the bar quite so
much yeah
4a and 4b i'll just answer super quick
james let me know if you find any
problems with it because they're very
related
but the physique templates upper body
chest uh first day the incline presses
the first exercise and horizontal
blushes later is that because of stomach
fatigue no it's because most people who
do physique templates want a bigger
upper chest they want more
um and then it says would it be said to
switch them up first horizontal later
incline and also switch the
later upper body uh back first first
decline press that horizontal press
is absolutely not a sin at all james any
problems there
not at all great what if you were like
you know what mike that's a really
ridiculous answer and i think honestly
you're slipping
[Laughter]
i can't believe i work for this company
i'm out
goodbye i don't mean good i just buy
you know what and i'm unsubscribing from
this youtube channel too already
wow it's nice that you are subscribed to
your own youtube channel
uh you get pinged with your own alerts
like oh look i'm on tv
uh number five i was doing my workout at
the gym
in the morning when suddenly i got the
info that certain meeting was moved
to an earlier time and it needed to end
my work up prematurely i two exercises
left
incline press first then horizontal
press both have three to four sets
playing for work i managed to do one set
of incline press
they got to message toronto meeting my
plan is now to go back to the gym after
work today
and do the six to seven unfinished sets
in similar situations what would your
recommendation be mine would be to just
do exactly we did
do the sets the following day if it was
a rest day that's also totally fine or
just don't do the sets at all
and chill out or do as i did do as you
did sec
first second is do them on the next day
if it's a rest day
and then last advice is don't do them at
all i think we say
skip the workout altogether if you start
if you miss like half a week of training
like if it is two days in a row
just pretend that they never happen to
just go on to the rest of your week
um but if you miss one day then usually
you can just
bump the rest of your days up and or
squeeze it in somewhere and get it done
james yeah there's especially like if
you're on like a four times per week
program
the level of overlap there is such is
such not a huge deal
i think do as you did or do it the next
day are your best options
do what you did when you've done that to
me daniel newman's
hey there dr jamie and dr mike
jamae how closely does the
resensitization phase in the amputee
make a strength phase for background i'm
a very large human six nine male now
weighing 260 good god
that's a huge foul big foot dog we found
him he's real
i am a relative beginner in terms of
physique training thank god because you
when you get jacked you're gonna start
eating he's gonna be gigantic fuck i
spent my college years as a competitive
club rower and that required me to drop
a decent amount of weight for my high
school days fat kid
and had me as low as 220 pounds stick
figure looking guy after college i spent
a year so doing crossfit which was fun
but then i decided i wanted to gross a
muscle and look like a person who
most likely works out i spent uh time
from september to 2019
current massing up with many cuts in the
middle as i end my current mass in about
a week it is time for some maintenance
and then i cut to see how this whole
thing went
my general thought is maintenance would
be a good time to get stronger and
re-sensitize things
a little bit before heading into a cut
because i've been doing all this high
rep jazz from another program for seven
months now and it's growing a little
stale
going to be purchasing the full body mpt
and sometime between now and when the
lockdown ends because gyms are closed
down on long island and want to know a
general erection i should be pointing
the boat
thanks and appreciate your time i think
if you just mostly want to get jacked i
think a re-sensitization phase in the
mpt is totally fine
um but if you want to um get a little
stronger run the resensitization
phase but run it for a little bit longer
and go a little um
uh you know uh even a little bit heavier
than it says
and then all of a sudden it's more like
a straight phase james
yeah so the the re-sensitization phase
is very similar
although not exactly the same strength
phase in terms of like some of the rep
ranges and total volume
similar for usually for like if you were
to take that
and say i want to make this a strength
phase i would go a little bit heavier to
start
have a slightly uh more aggressive
intensity progression and then you might
find yourself adding a set here or there
um yeah
a little bit more than what's what's on
there's the base so like the mev for
strength
is definitely like above uh maybe what
we would say the mv for
hypertrophy in that sense so you'd still
need to do a little bit more training if
you want to get stronger but it's
it's pretty close it's like right in
that ballpark
yeah great answer steve mcdonald
owner of mcdonald's restaurants all
around the world
dr mike and dr james thanks for all the
awesome content for me to consume
in my isolation through your online
lectures i've learned about the upside
down volcanoes and dr mike's propensity
to cry alone
wait what did i miss something what's
with the volcanoes i don't remember the
upside down volcanoes
but oh it's probably the uh shitting
reference
ah yes okay number one for a performance
standpoint i know intermittent fasting
isn't the greatest
but some evidence seems to suggest that
it may be a good thing for health
longevity if somebody had hypothetically
of course was running if and only having
a 12 hour feeding window during a mass
phase
and also training first thing in the
morning fasted would it be largely
beneficial for them to add
an intra-workout shake um to the morning
workout
uh if so should the inter-workout shake
be larger than is typically suggested
yes and should a good part of it be
consumed as a bonus in the beginning of
the training session also yes
or would it be best to get a shake in
before the training session and eat the
last meal of the day earlier to maintain
the 12-hour window uh that could be an
idea for sure i think uh
that definitely has some merit i don't
think it would be better but it's
something to try
see how your energy levels feel and
lastly the sympathetic idiot is also
using the dyed app but uh telling any
sleeps an hour 11 hours a night
uh and following the physique template
to great success one thing i just want
to point out so all those things that i
just answered we'll see
james agrees um massing and longevity
are literally contravailing to each
other so
i agree uh just you know if you're going
to mass just do it right get jacked and
then
run if when you're older and are ready
to be smaller and
long live for longer i just wouldn't do
both the same time almost every single
benefit of if gets erased completely
with a hypercaloric
diet yeah so i agree with mike's points
there and also it makes massing
needlessly difficult because now you
have to consume these
massive fucking meals at the end of the
day instead of just having like a kind
of normal
titration of meals that are a little bit
more than you usually now it's like okay
now i have these like
five fucking gigantic meals i'm stuffed
down it's gonna be miserable
when i was reading this question i
couldn't help but think so he said
something uh oh yeah here we go should
the
intro workout shake be larger than as
typically suggested and then i was
thinking like
like an intro workout jamba juice or
something at that point yeah
[Laughter]
that would be pretty amazing um yeah i
mean i agree with mike i would just
instead of doing all this needlessly
complicated stuff like i would just
adopt a more even split of feedings
during your mass
you can always go back to if later i
think for massing it's just easier
number two any updates in your approach
of a book release no i'm trapped in the
house
please give me things to read uh we are
no melissa davis is editing it but she
has been pushed back a little bit by
having to edit
the now released and completed at home
uh
templates which took great priority but
it's in the works it'll be released
sometime in probably late summer early
fall
um i can attest that she's working very
hard on it
yeah number three any thoughts of
creating a physique or strength app
or my dream combining these with the
diet app or my dream stream combining
all these with the power phase
uh we've had power fins yeah
bro what are we easy yeah about at least
some of these
uh particularly the creation of physique
or strength that we have had
much more than thoughts but uh apps take
a long time to build
that's all we're gonna say in the in the
meantime if you're looking for any kind
of strength e
apps i would definitely check out the uh
chatbot which is the
chad's strength training ai system which
yeah people have a lot of success with
um
but you know other than that just i
would say stay tuned
paul de sadeliere says hey docs
how would you expect blood results in a
male natural bodybuilder change
when dieting to very lean conditioning
ie testosterone levels bone density
resting heart rate i'll drop
how about impacts on red blood cells
white blood cells
uh and a bunch of heart stuff platelet
counts uh similarly
how would you expect blood results to
change after i approach the overreaching
phase plenty of research on this
topic endurance athletes but
implications natural bodybuilders no
fucking clue whatsoever i would ask a
medical doctor that shit
yeah i think actually a good person to
be to ask those kind of questions
would be scott he's a a
medical doctor so yeah he knows strength
conditioning really well he works for
the tudor bob institute he is a medical
doctor
and he actually does a ton
of uh endocrine stuff right now i don't
know if you've been seeing his posts at
all but he's been just oh my god
crazy endocrine stuff so he's just that
would be a really good person to
reference
yeah dr scott howell h-o-w-e-l-l
[Music]
number two if an athlete has better
technique and feels better stimulus my
muscle connection and dom's from pause
drops not rust pause sense
would there be any disadvantage to using
pause reps for all movements across an
entire periphery program no
miss out on heavy weighted stretch not
really uh maybe a little bit
but potentially make up for with lower
axis loading and better sfr
and improve technique absolutely look if
you can check all those boxes
then there's really no need to do
anything else outside of variation so
but the the variation question kind of
answers itself because stainless will
reduce your sfr for a given technique
and then replacing it with another
technique is by definition a better sfr
so james i don't mean to be pedantic he
wrote stf are we assuming he meant
sfr or is there something else that i'm
missing the only possible way i could
understand
see i was thinking like stfu like
internet
better shut the fuck up maybe i'm like
wow damn this guy
[Laughter]
yeah i'm assuming so far and if that's
the case then i agree um with what you
said
magnus says hello question 102. let's
see magnus always cracks me up because
everyone else has like a
they're you know kind of full-ish name
and then when i'm compiling the
questions it's like magnus
that's all he needs question one of two
let's say
i am used to training each muscle two
times a week on average at an average
accumulation phase volume
of 14 to 16 cents cross over per week
and let's say i can progress on that
then i do two to three months of
training with each muscle three times a
week and an average accumulation phase
of 18 cents for us a
week followed by a resensitization phase
given everything else was constant
stress contribution etc and i returned
to the frequency
the first frequency in volume but i
theoretically now require more
more to progress yes but you would
require more to progress anyway because
over time you require more anyway
um you would require more to progress
but not much more because you did do a
resensitization phase
james sorry i got lost in that one i'm
rereading it
let me know if i can super quickly sum
it up for you basically training twice a
week and then training three times a
week
do you need more after three times a
week even after you take a resistance
phase is your body somehow more
permanently resistant to volume
i would say no not much more than if you
somehow did that much more volume like
basically over the course of your life
as you accumulate and more and more
volume
you need more and more volume to grow
there's no huge way around that
re-sensitization phases buy you a
shitload of extra time
but eventually you know they only work
so well so re-sensitization phase fixes
most of that
but look at it this way with the two to
three months of training that you did
at three times a week you would grow
more muscle and you would become more
volume
uh resistant both the thing is
if you didn't become more volume
resistant you wouldn't have grown that
extra muscle
so that's what extra muscle costs you
could almost say that
increased muscle mass comes with an
increased resistance to more muscle mass
you couldn't just just say that that is
absolutely true so you could say like
i want a ronicolon level of muscle while
ronnie coleman at his peak
could grow zero muscle if that makes any
sense
yeah so um i agree with what mike's
saying here and so
the idea would be like um it wouldn't it
wouldn't kind of
cause you to accrue like a
disproportionate amount of adaptive
resistance
the problem would be when you are
getting to a point where you need to now
train
each muscle group three times per week
in order to stimulate growth that would
be an indicator that
you've been progressing in your training
age so much that you are accruing a
pretty substantial amount of adaptive
resistance
and that would be a product of you need
to actually just get more training
volume
but you cannot simply cram it into one
to two sessions anymore it has to be
spread out over
several sessions so that would be kind
of like a the the intermediate conundrum
is where you can no longer train all
things at all times
the advanced conundrum is i need to do
more but i have to do less and do it
more frequently
yeah so um i don't i think
like you don't gain adaptive resistance
uh any differently than if you
any other time that you would train so
if you go in and train you're going to
do some adaptive resistance over time so
i don't think like
switching for one mezzo is going to like
skyrocket you into
at the late intermediate stage if that's
what you're worrying about there's no
no more than any other training session
would right
question two what are your preferred
ways to determine when it's time to
change focus
slash face going from cutting to mass
synopsis as
uh closely related how do you prefer to
estimate body fat i'm aware of air's
most common methods
could something like given a decent low
body fat percentage starting point
massive performance at a rate about one
percent body weight per month
followed by four week resensitization
followed by a four week cut
uh at a rate loss of 0.5 0.75 body
weight
per week for intermediate work and
definitely given no competitions so
nothing works indefinitely but it could
work for a long time absolutely
um and thus largely take care of the
need to estimate given body fat
percentage or the need to estimate
when it's time to change phase in the
first place largely but not holding
here's why
um my preferred method and we'll see
where james is is just the mirror
and the scale really just the mirror
like uh i'll set a certain gain rate and
i'll check the scale and see if i'm like
roughly
uh something's happening and then i look
in the mirror and when i'm too fat for
my own liking and
for my case like you know outside of a
certain level of fat that's targeting
bodybuilding competitions are getting
super lean
then i stop and then i reverse course
and i cut and when i'm lean enough i
stop
in a reverse course right um at the end
of the day because we're doing this all
to look good in the mirror
but looking in the mirror apart is a
really really critical part of it a lot
of prep coaches bodybuilding especially
ones
that give the deal not with naturals but
with drug bodybuilders
there's so much flux to body weight with
drugs that they don't even look at the
scale like the
the guys send them their body weights
but they look at the number ones just
certainly okay whatever
but they just do weekly progress
pictures and adjust macros
and cardio weights accordingly um so
you know at the end of the day how you
look it really is the big thing and look
if you have shredded fucking abs but
like you've done four months of gaining
and you've gained stuff and you're still
shredded as fuck
maybe you shouldn't cut maybe you should
keep passing right
and at the other hand if you're like
four months three months into massing
and you look like a fat piece of shit
and you're like fuck my watch still got
a week or a month of fasting like maybe
you don't maybe it's time to cut
so i would say this is a good baseline
to have and then your appearance
every month at least uh careful
examination of like how many abs you can
see and stuff
uh is a good way to sort of auto
regulate that james
yeah i think that's really good and you
know you can also use things like your
pant size or like your belt loops as a
way of kind of
getting like a little bit more of it's
not really like a quantitative thing so
much as just like another kind of
supplemental uh supporting piece of
evidence and and that that works really
good so
for me like i know of my pant size if i
go up to 36
like you are jabba you are getting real
fat dude you need to calm it down if i
get down to like a 32
that's like god damn james you got some
you got pretty leans because i know most
of the time i hang out around a 34 or i
can use the
my uh weight training belt right and if
i can close it all the way yeah
i'm pretty lean right and if i have like
six
six holes to go not very lean
so all those things you can kind of put
together uh
any number of those combinations of
things i think the mirror being probably
the best one
scale being supplemental close fit close
feel being another supplemental one
and one thing that i do and this is just
compulsive is i do like my my uh super
iliac skin fold all the time and i just
kind of keep
keep tabs on how that feels for myself
sure not a measurement it's just like a
very rough like okay okay this is i know
how it's
done it's kind of feeling bigger lately
maybe i should ease up
stuff like that andrew stephen says dr
michael
dr james i'm 23 and i've been training
with what i've considered annually
increasing degree of intelligence and
awareness
of my diet for around five years back in
the summer a surgery on my hip
don't worry an automatic question which
results in a 10-week layout from all
training i'm currently working through
my rehab
and have returned to my regularly
scheduled upper body training obviously
i don't want to be cutting now as i
would hinder my progress on rehab but my
surgeon said it would ease some stress
on my hip to shed a few pounds
so i can't really add any meaningful
amount of muscle either as it would be
accompanied by more body fat
i do not have a ton of excess body fat
i'm six to 240ish maybe
15 to 20 pounds i did let my body come
slippery out of surgery while pursuing
performance goals i'm currently reading
rpg diet 2.0 for the first time
i've been using the diet for quite some
time though and it says that aside from
three special circumstances provided
pursuing meaningful body composition
changes on us or diet as a fool's errand
there's a complete waste of time before
a high-volume business training while
maintenance
but it'd be better served to ease up on
the training until i want to uh once
again 100 good to go
or is it possible to make slight body
cam changes through this combination of
diet training for you it is because you
took a while off
whole body after a surgery so i think
you absolutely do high volume and gain
muscle and lose fat at the same time
in your upper body james yeah and it's
it's not a total wash to train like up
to
your whatever respective mrvs that you
can while under isoclara conditions
you'll have really really good training
and some of that will carry out carry
you on to better training later on
even if it doesn't invest right exactly
here and now not to mention
it's also just a good strategy when
you're uh kind of cooped up and you've
been off training for a while and you're
just
starting to kind of get back into the
groove like yeah it's good to do
a few things hard if you can so i i'd
say go for it
yeah andrew middlebrook says when
training five percent what are the
downsides
of to pre-exhausting muscle groups and
beginners intermediates and what are the
downsides for advanced lifters
so there's there's actually a way to
downside uh for both
uh one will pay a bigger cost than the
other big downside is if you pre-exhaust
with um an exercise that does not have a
a
really awesome raw stimulus magnitude
and then the exercise you go to after
does have an awesome raw stimulus
magnitude
you could lower your overall raw
stimulus magnitude for the session
like if you do leg extensions before
squats which is something that was
detailed
in a a discussion i had with
coach kassem on revive stronger with
steve hall
if you do pre-exhaust leg extensions
before squats you're essentially like
getting tired doing a pretty shitty
exercise and then you're not performing
so well on the
very good exercise after if those happen
to be those exercises for you that are
very shooting very good
so my recommendation is pre-exhaust with
like hack squats or leg presses which is
an incredible
awesome compound super limited by the
quads exercise
and then afterwards yeah the squats are
worse but you still put your best
exercise first so
you don't want to like pre like you say
cable flies really suck for me i can
barely feed my chest
i love incline barbell pressing it fries
the fuck out of me don't do
as a beginner intermediate for sure
cable flies before inclines because
you're going to fuck yourself over the
total rust in this magnitude is going to
suck
beginners intermediates don't have to
worry about stimulus to fatigue ratio
too much
because the fatigue is not a really
often a limiting factor for them
their rosters magnitude needs to be high
though to get them gains and sometimes i
can just sort of fuck you over
for advanced lifters same idea but
usually advanced lifters their sfr are
such a big cap
they have no problem accumulating enough
raw stimulus magnitude they have to make
sure the systemic and uh
uh you know cross-muscular fatigue is
limited so they might still do those
not so great cable flies before incline
bench because to them
zapping their upper pecs is not a
problem it's making sure their shoulders
and triceps and elbows and
spine and soul aren't so tired from
doing 405 pound inclines that they can't
do back and chest and all the other
stuff later
so the downsides really is make sure the
movement you're pre-exhausting with is
still a fucking brutal movement but
more isolationy than the movement you
have after uh and
and then you're really really good to go
don't just pre-exhaust
some dog shit movement to just become
more tired for your exercise that comes
later
yes those are all really good points i
think one of the big downsides for
beginners is it's completely unnecessary
and actually doing
um pre-exhaust in terms of just total
amount of sets per muscle group
might actually just put you over what
you need altogether like you might have
only needed to do three sets of quads or
chest or whatever but that might have
been all it needed to get a robust
stimulus at that point
and going up to you know doing two or
three sets of pre-exhaust and then going
to doing two or three sets of something
else
might actually put you over the curve in
terms of how much like
stressors you've accrued during that
session to be productive so i would say
for beginners it's completely needless
because you need very little to one way
uh for intermediates
it's definitely going to inhibit your
potentially inhibit your ability to
accrue high volumes and or like a very
good
intensity stimulus per the volume that
you're accruing i think for
intermediates you can make a case to
situations where we can improve my
muscle connection and stuff back by
doing the pre-exhaust
but i would still say like the quality
and quantity of the training is probably
going to become more limited
and then i think the the best
application is is definitely advanced
for using some of the pre-exhaust it
might already kind of blend some of the
pros and cons of it so just
you know you can make a case for
intermediates but i still don't think
it's it's just not as good of a bang for
your buck i would rather see them do
compounds and down sets rather than
pre-exhaust income
yes and another one is uh it's really
shitty stimulus to time ratio sdr
pre-exhaust but almost by definition and
another problem is like it might not let
you develop all the other musculature
training so like beginners yeah a lot of
just regular squats because they could
train their glutes and addictors and
hamstrings
or glutes adductors and quads a lot like
over med for all of them
uh really really good stimulus for all
of them with just one exercise whereas
if you pre-fatigue
with leg extensions then you know like a
lot of those other muscles just
don't really have like they don't really
get a lot out of it you end up like sort
of like okay great your quads grew a
little faster maybe
but like you're the rest of your muscles
didn't and look when you're a beginner
you need all the muscle you can get in
all the muscle groups you need to do the
hardcore compound movements probably
first because they're so
uh stimulus to time ratio so good
definitely joseph heslop rounds out our
final questions for every plus and then
we move on to youtube
says hi again i was on last week uh
second question about testing for rir
i was looking this past week at example
programs at the bottom of the new series
uh in the hypertrophy guide in
conjunction
with lectures on block training as far
as i understand the objective when it
comes to volume over the motorcycle is
transformed from mv to mrv
yes actually it's a start at med and
continue to progress until
you can no longer perform whereas the
mrv's not the goal it's the result
right um it's a little bit of a
different uh
different situation um i'll make a
perfect analogy for you
um you when you like rent a go-kart
and they um tell you that you know
you know like is when the gas runs out
like you need to
pay for more gas or like that's when
your lease expires and you have to go
home you can't ride the go-kart anymore
it's not proper to say that the purpose
of go-karting is to try to
get rid of all the gas but when you get
rid of all the gas the go-karting times
come
to an end the point is to ride it right
so we're not trying to get to our mrv
but we
inevitably will does that make sense
james yeah so i i want to give
a little credit so from like a pre if
you're looking at it from like a
pre-planning standpoint then yes you
have the right idea but then
also says it's not all pre-planning it's
auto-regulated as well so
it's both it's feedback and feed forward
so like
the idea is to get from there to there
right but
the the latter point it just kind of
manifests itself
over time from the auto regulation so
yeah if you're on the right title you
want
yeah yeah um now in the lectures
it is expressed that mrv over training
block increases
this is displayed in the new example
programs uh yep
my confusion arises when comparing the
final volumes of each mouse cycle for
example
uh they nicknamed the program nicknamed
atlantic a sample program for the back
finalizes with volumes of
12 sets 23 sets and 30 sets respectively
for mesos one two and three
are these final volumes an example of
where an individual's mrv may take them
yes and do they really differ by such
magnitudes going from meson to meso only
if you increase frequency like the mesos
illustrate
so there's two things going on there one
mrvs go up over multiple mesos and
within each meso for sure but over
multiple mesos definitely
number two the mesos increase frequency
every time and it's been shown
that just doing a higher frequency
within a meso means
that you can squeeze more sessions of
roughly similar volumes
into the week and still recover right
and still make an adaptation
so it really uh that's where
most of that comes from if it was just
uh two session programs mesos one two
and three were all two session programs
the the final volumes would be like 12
14
16. it would be 12 23 30 right and that
30
for like the four time movie program
that is not sustainable for any longer
than like one mesocycle but that's why
it has that block structure
yeah this is a good good uh points
because i think people will get confused
on that there's like oh my mrv is 30 now
right yeah if you if you if it is it is
i understand exercise selection later
measures less fatigue so that's another
contributor all right
uh well i would say a minor one uh each
set which you could explain back to the
jumps regardless 12 sets
for back of them or vm as a one seems
intuitive very little so perhaps i'm
misunderstanding something
i get that these are just examples but i
do believe the rough average of the old
back guided mrv of 24. notice the
average is still
basically essentially the same um what
you want to do
uh joseph is scroll all the way up to
the top of that hypertrophy guide for
back
and look at the volume guides and in the
mrv it talks about how different
sessions roughly correspond to different
mrvs
so it'll say like in you know two
session backup marketing maybe 23
in a three session 24 and a four session
like roughly 30 something like that
right
it does say that actually at the
beginning in the literal sense
and just another quick note so there's
the frequency difference and there's
also the loading spectrum differences
across those mesos
and exercise selection and exercise
selection so one
the blend of everything but generally is
heavier weights
so that drives the mev and the mrv down
as you lighten up in weight they both
kind of shift up a little bit and keep
shifting up as you lighten up in weight
so that's another reason why you see
that trend so method two is kind of
fifth
like a nice even split and then meso
three is a little bit more
light focused yep and the uh
the lighter weights might not have any
different session characteristics like
the mav per session might be the same
but lightweights is heavy
but you recover faster from light
weights day to day
uh than you do from heavy weights so you
can squeeze in another light workout and
be totally fine whereas if you squeezed
in a 5 to 10 rep workout it would
squeeze you the fuck out of your body
like a tube of toothpaste yes
yes finally in a meso are you supposed
to finish just under your mrv the week
before keep going right until you're
underperformed so it's proven
uh either works but you really only know
if you have it under performance but
either it's fine also what is the best
course of action
if you say you have reached mrv one of
the muscles but not the others
do you keep going try to prolong the
meso perhaps with light days until the
other muscle groups reach that point
call the end of the mess right there
that's actually a very complex question
it really depends on which way you want
to go
um that's why these are just muscle
guides and natural mesoguides we're
going to be writing extensively about um
a sort of a formal way to treat this
problem in the hypertrophy book
and there are uh on rp plus there are
lectures currently being put out on how
to treat this uh in the advanced
hypertrophy series which are currently
being released i would go to look at
there
but basically you sort of set yourself
some guides beforehand
and you find yourself in a situation of
like if you have to recycle a muscle
twice
uh it's probably time to end the
mesocycle
and if more than half of your muscle
groups have to be recycled back to med
from mrv
then it's probably time to end it but
there's a bit of nuance there and a lot
of specificity to that answer so i would
i would look into those resources
and then in the hypertrophy we'll
explain it very very carefully
yeah and just real quick too so like
it's gonna be very different from
situation situations so if you have your
biceps have overreached prematurely
maybe
uh you can take a couple light days on
your biceps and it will have very
negligible effects on anything else that
you do
however if it's your quadriceps right
and your quadriceps over prematurely
before everything else does if you take
a couple light days on your quadriceps
all of your other muscles and all the
other trains can be all out of fucking
whack because now all of a sudden your
preparedness is spiked up and your
tolerance to things have spiked up
really really high and it becomes the
big
so even just taking a couple light
sessions on the quads might actually
extend your mesocycle out another week
potentially
in some cases so it's hard it's a hard
it's a hard
question to answer in a very simple
direct like here is the correct path
that you should always follow a very
good point
all right to the youtube to the youtube
we go
and to finish up
i'm sharing my screen
boom
[Music]
okay
where is the one i saw okay kyo
lurayo says dr james i was wondering if
you could die sorry to cut you off
i actually recorded my uh dr james does
sports lecture and i covered this
question in many of these other ones oh
directly already so if all right well
i'll just i'll just take a few more of
these and then
i picked out the sporty one so if
there's any like like
more general or body possession ones
let's tackle those any other one
i grab i can answer a couple of these
real quick clint moser says hello docs i
heard mike
uh talking to broderick chavez about the
sandwich technique the available behind
the times
or something but i noticed this is not
in the new hypertrophy guides but at the
moment still
in the old chest guide i've started
using it for chest and back and like a
lot so just wondering where you stand in
it currently is something
to utilize if someone isn't feeling the
intended muscle or could hypertrophy be
hindered by sandwiching the isolation
between the compounds
because the weight is quite a bit less
than the second compound during the
sandwich
uh compound isolation compound versus
typical compound compound isolation
level video so that second thing i would
be concerned about
the isolation the sandwich is really
really great
if you have the volume within your um
session to to need it so it's more of an
advanced technique for people training
relatively high per session volumes
if you do like six sets per muscle group
per session
then you just do two sets or three sets
of something in three sets of something
else or even just six sets of one thing
uh there's just no time for the sandwich
but if you're doing like 10 cents or 12
cents which some people need and some
people benefit from
then the sandwich becomes awesome and
the sandwich is really like more for uh
advanced folks
uh that really want to simultaneously
fuck up their shit
from a real hardcore like you know train
what's fresh perspective
and also get the benefit of
pre-exhaustion so
yeah that was really good i'm i can't
help but notice that lane norton is he
natural
is he really nine percent the great
descent
uh scroll down a little bit
sorry yeah i mean like daddy or not
like uh yeah it's just like pure
speculation
it's just like it's just like it's just
like pure smear campaign
too right yeah that's all greg does is
he just beefs with people
like talks shit daddy or not and he gets
in the views right he's making a lot of
money on youtube
what he wants is literally what he said
um all right
here's an interesting one jacob kowalski
says do you believe tom plants induced
hyperplasia in his legs
heartbreak knuckles talking about
hyperplasia he said he believes it can
happen in humans
uh tom trained like a madman at his peak
and he would only train legs twice a
month
doing stuff like four or five times 50
reps for hamstring curls beyond failure
with isometric force drops baby reps etc
so i've actually several times in
several muscles done so much in one
session that it really fucked me up and
permanently it's like debilitated my
muscles and they're still
sort of some like my packs and triceps
are still a little bit fucked up from
that
uh 10 years to 15 years later so i think
there is such a thing as
acute over training of a local muscle uh
so i'd be very averse to doing crazy
shit like this
and also because the evidence and
reasoning for hyperplasia as
uh especially caused by this kind of
crazy training
is very scant uh i wouldn't bet on it
and lastly there's been very well
documented the training with excessive
amounts of damage can actually reduce
muscle mass or not cause much
accretion of mass so i just wouldn't bet
on it uh
and maybe hyperplasia occurs but i'm
just not sure greg would be the first
person to tell you that
he asked knuckles is the way john
platt's trained to sure fire weight and
hands hyper play he would be like
i absolutely can't tell you that i
actually just don't know and nobody does
um hyperplasias is a real it's a real
big question
it's incredibly difficult to test
because you'd have to just dissect an
entire human to count all the muscle
fibers right that's
really tough to do um well easy to do
highly immoral uh but uh
you know so i'm not sure and i
personally and james would
like to hear you say i as a practitioner
would not recommend insanity training
where you train once every two weeks
i think the downsides most of the time
outweigh
yeah the thing is like um it's not even
if you can stimulate hyperplasia to any
tangible degree it's not clear that that
gives you an advantage over just
traditional hypertrophy
of the muscle which bodybuilders seem to
do pretty goddamn well these days
so why risk doing something crazy that
could have like pretty severe
repercussions if you get an injury
uh over just doing kind of tried and
true stuff which the anecdote supports
and the science reports it's like yeah
why you know hyperplasia as i know is
like a happy accident that's our
understanding right now we don't really
have any
clear guiding light as to why it does
happen so there's no point in chasing
after it
at least for now last question kevin
foss says i can't remember from the last
webinar in a podcast listen to it mike
but he said something about having legs
pass a certain size causing problems
like vomiting from an intense workout
just because they take more blood from
the rest of the body this is definitely
dumb but i can't stop thinking about it
would it not be beneficial to just have
more blood how does the body control how
much blood you have it is a beneficial
to get
uh it to produce blood doping man that's
the real
way of performance enhancement so so
actually anabolic steroids give you more
blood
and that's one of the ways in which they
enhance a ton of things including
performance
uh they also make you bigger which
compounds the problem
and it gets you back to square one uh
but uh one of the
sort of paramount things about being out
of shape so if you take someone with big
strong muscles
and they haven't trained with very high
volumes in a while
they're going to vomit real fast for
high volumes in many for many reasons
but partly because their blood volume is
not as high
when you train with high volumes for a
while your blood volume does go
up um and that absolutely makes you
vomit less and makes you much more uh
efficient to training so i do think that
that's definitely a thing
you got to be careful about how much
more blood you have it has to come with
an equal amount plasma equal amount um
red blood cell component because i'm
getting a check this out i wonder if you
guys can see this
can you see that political call yeah
like detroit michigan
they gotta want me to vote for something
because my number is 248 and
two times to grow up around detroit i
think like i'm still voting for fucking
local candidates there
um they send me text messages sometimes
i literally was like if you don't stop
sending me this i'll embarrass you
publicly
this is fucking atrocious privacy and
they're like sorry
like nobody ever wants a text from
anything political you're on your
fucking mind
but anyway um what's it called uh
you know if you have too high of an rbc
count which you can get through blood
doping and through
through erythropoietin um
drug use you can actually die from uh
excessively thick blood
and uh you know you guys think
bodybuilding's dangerous
statistically elite cycling is way more
dangerous those guys drop dead
fucking regularly in their sleep because
their blood is too thick
uh not through natural training means
just through blood doping and epo doping
so yeah more blood is great but it's
actually even more dangerous
compromise if you take it too far than
any amount of real like real world gear
you can take
so there you go you're here first yeah
um i don't i'm i'm wondering if like
doing like a blood dope protocol would
prevent you from vomiting in some cases
definitely reduce it uh because you know
you would just first of all less blood
would go
right you would have more blood left
over for your gi tract so you wouldn't
freak out on that level
and also it'd probably be a little bit
better in buffering lactic acid
so yeah definitely but but it's an
interesting thought
yeah but but you know like you have as
much blood as you have and
the process by which to increase blood
in every normal sense corresponds to
just higher volume training
which is doing anyway right the the
thing about vomiting less is do the kind
of training that makes you vomit and you
will vomit less right
but on top of that enhancing blood
supply beyond that
is real like boy oh boy you taking some
serious risks there
fuck that tons of guys at a high level
in bodybuilding donate blood regularly
to keep their red blood cell count
artificially
down because it gets so high it starts
to get dangerous so it's really the
opposite sort of problem a lot of times
for sure all right well we went for
about a little over an hour and a half
so i think we're probably going to wrap
this one up
i think that was we hit all our
landmarks we finished and we did three
youtubes that's it
that's it so guys just so you know i
actually started a new little
kind of weekly series or maybe weekly
but another series on
q a and some sporting examples this is
called dr james
does sport training and so i took all
those sport questions that were on the
webinar that mike was just reading and i
picked
some from other webinars and from some
instagram stuff
and i just recorded it this morning or
this afternoon and so i'm going to send
it to our video guy to get processed and
hopefully that will get posted either
this week or next week
and then if you have more specific like
sport training questions like power
lifting cycling
rugby whatever you can pop those into
that feed and we'll just talk i did uh
the person this week who got the the for
me was the arm wrestling exam guys so i
did a very brief
brief arm wrestling example of how you
might shut up a training ram
uh and i i just do another round of that
one because that one i did
i did like the general overview i feel
that the the periodization stuff really
good and now i kind of want to go back
and do some of the more nitty gritty
stuff i have got my wheels turning a bit
so whoever sent in that wrestling
question thumbs up to you god you got
the nod this week uh mike anything from
you before we
before we sign off yeah listen folks if
uh you
or especially um well okay so if your
family members
or friends need at home training guides
rp's got them on a big sale with male
and female they're not available
just dumbbells that's all you need and
uh it's going to be great during these
times they're for sale they're doing
super well already so
just for you guys to keep a lookout
lastly myself
um charlie and i are doing a crazy super
high volume multiple session program now
that we don't have dick house to do
um and because we can't train super
heavy we can train with higher frequency
so that inspired me to write a super
high volume
entire block of training for at home
training and we're very likely going to
be giving that away free
in about a week or two here uh yeah so
like
if you guys are interested uh just keep
a lookout for that do not fucking
message me and ask me when's that coming
out because
i told you already and it's not very
clear but uh it will be coming out you
will be made
aware of it and it's going to be
something cool that if you're really
stuck at home
and you want to do a ton of training
during the quarantine then you're going
to be
you're going to have all the training
you want all right well
if you guys aren't already doing so
please feel free to post comments
in the youtube section on these weekly
webinars
it's for you know asking me about
questions or just more general q a like
we have been doing please post the
comments there
subscribe to the rp youtube feed so you
get all the videos when they come out
and i don't know i want to spill beans
or anything but uh we might other sports
scientists sometime soon so maybe keep
your eyes peeled for that
so that's all i got i think we're gonna
sign up for this one
bye
