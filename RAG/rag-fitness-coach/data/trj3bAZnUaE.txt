[Music]
you're supposed to be like this where's
my other leg go put out in front of you
this is actually pretty nice
we are here in Atlantis gym in Nashville
in La pal and came back into Canada
and we are going to be working out on
some interesting machines this isn't
Grandma's gym it's a gym where a lot of
new Atlanta stuff is test bedded they'll
throw a new prototype machine in here
and then we'll see how it goes so we're
gonna do some of those we'll also have
some machines in here that never went
into formal production because reasons
it's not because they're unsafe or
anything like that I don't think and
we're gonna try some of those you know
what we're also just gonna try some
machines
for the soul
that's it even though Russians don't
have souls why the hell did I said in
Russia I don't know let's go train
[Music]
this is slightly angled forward
which puts the biceps in a really good
position
for that stretch
which is why we like this a crap load a
lot of these machines that are in Lantus
the pads the elbow pads way back there
to create leverage which is
just using a bunch of load for no reason
so this is really really cool because
you're it's a huge stretch at the bottom
and a lot of tension the entire time
this uh machine basically allows you to
do a
um a glue ham raise of various sorts or
Nordic butt assistance and so it's kind
of like a Nordic curl glute ham race
combo quite decent
uh it's really smooth
and what I would recommend you do is
really slowly control The Eccentric and
then on the way back up uh really try to
develop a mind muscle connection with
your hamstrings by pulling everything in
and uh it's quite nice
really anything that has any sort of
vertical component for me
if you don't have a knee pad to support
yourself from the resistance of it
pulling you back up this way
I don't like it that much generally when
it gets really hard you kind of start to
come off the pad a little bit I just I'm
not too much of a fan this is a really
nice resistance profile yeah it's just
if there was a knee patch support or
something like that it'd be way better I
think yeah this is a good machine to do
variation it's a different pulling
angling mostly you'll encounter a high
roast kind of unusual in this regard
especially with cables I would like to
do this at the end of a workout for very
High Reps and that way you don't need
the the counter support and then you're
still making some games
[Music]
this machine is awesome
couple reasons one
this lifts up and is above parallel
already
so the lever arm gets positioned
worse with respect to gravity as it goes
off
which means that it's hardest at the
bottom here easiest at the top which is
exactly how you want to do hypertrophic
training because it stretches that
bottom stretch like crazy
it's a decline press which is really
interesting and it's very unique you
won't see this almost anywhere else it's
got an unloader plate which means you
can push off with your feet so you can
get into the position of a super deep
stretch and man if I'm doing decline
work
this is tip of the spear
a lot of people like bulgarians this is
a pretty damn cool machine
you can adjust where this goes you can
grab out further I probably would use
these if I were to do it so this
machine's pretty dope I like it you do
straight legs with it too you'd have to
probably stand on something but
definitely a really cool machine and
doubles as a shrug machine you can do
shrugs forward this way
but my recommendation is to turn around
and do them the other way because then
you can get the traps pulling back as
well they don't really do a whole lot
forward so
get up here
Leverage
Big Stretch this is a prototype so maybe
you'll see it at a gym near you very
soon
[Music]
this is kind of interesting it's like a
glute Kickback machine
but it's uh plate loaded which is uh
very unusual
and if you get a good grip in here and
put one on your feet on the ground
instead like what I did they asked me
how many more sets you have left got 10
more sets Okay it's quite nice and as
like everything with Atlantis it's so
smooth I don't know how they do it how
do they do it
you've seen this all kinds of handles
it's converging too it comes in I like
this one here because
squeeze your back you know completely
here
I like to put a lot of grips you know
what a feeling
[Applause]
[Music]
here you have the the regular Movement
Like This
yes
you have like this
you have like that here yep
hey yes too wow and
on both sides you know you can do both
sides on the other side too that's cool
so you have one two three
four five exercises at least
that's cool we're gonna use that for
sure
[Music]
these are high rows pretty well
leveraged I say because if you can see
the point at which the leverage will be
most difficult for you is really close
to that upper stretch just a little bit
below it and then at the very top
the lever arm is uh so tilted that
gravity barely affects it and then it's
easy at the crunch which matches both
the force curve of the back and the
ideal Force curve or near ideal Force
curve for hypertrophy which is more of
an intense stretch and less uh a less
intense uh situation of the contraction
that's real easy down here
more of a stretch up here
oh this is very well built
[Music]
[Music]
guys if you're ever in Canada
just go to Montreal if you're ever in
Montreal just go to the suburb of level
if you're ever in Laval get your ass
to the Atlantis gym here in Montreal and
if you're ever in the Atlantis gym in
Laval in Montreal in Quebec in Canada in
North America in the Western Hemisphere
on planet Earth in the solar system
then you might as well get on one of
these really interesting unique machines
and get at it because you won't have an
opportunity to use them anywhere and you
might get a good stimulus to fatigue
ratio and you might just love it how are
you feeling about this this is great
yeah I love the shim a lot of gyms in
the United States are getting a ton of
this equipment shipped there the club
has a bunch of stuff uh elevation
because I live in Vegas these are gyms
in Vegas that we've trained that you
guys have seen on the channel but uh and
they're getting more so
it's really cool because you walked
around the gym and he kind of takes the
input and advice from all of his members
and he just kind of Engineers new stuff
yeah so this is awesome it's awesome
guys on a more realistic note if you're
not in Atlantis gym itself anytime you
see a piece of Atlantis equipment try it
let's try it out smooth as shit it's
amazing uh all right see you next time
[Music]
thank you
we are here at Legend Atlantic
you're probably insulting everybody yeah
whatever hey whatever whoa hey fuck it
silly guy goes to Montreal
