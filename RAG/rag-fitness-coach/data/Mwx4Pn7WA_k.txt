hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
prioritization rp plus and
rpu lecture four
applying science going from theory to
practice
tying everything we've learned in this
entire course together
let's get right into it so
we're going to learn a couple things
today first we're going to learn about
how to use science to learn about
the world then about how to categorize
claims
then the ultimate of engineering
outcomes
and we're going to translate that into
sport and exercise science
we're going to talk about the state of
science and support and exercise science
we're going to talk about how to do
evidence-based practice and then we're
going to talk about how taking all of
these things to go as possible
using critical thinking wherever you
happen to be let's get
right into it probably the most
fundamental use of science
and something that has to happen first
before you use science for anything else
is to figure out how the world works and
how the hell does this happen well it's
done
on the front line by uh basic
researchers in science like
trying to understand cancer nah like
what kind of drugs cure cancer not
specific kinds
how does cancer happen something like
that that would be that would be called
basic research now
if you understand how cancer works and
you can probably understand how to
defeat cancer in a variety of
circumstances possibly all of them
right so basic science is a real real
big deal it really just paints
it lets us see how the world is
structured and of course in applied
science
we can see certain facets of basic
science how they expand
and applied science basically seeks to
answer direct questions but nonetheless
gives us a ton of information about how
the world
actually operates not so difficult to
access this because you can look up the
study results already done
through comprehensive reviews or
meta-analyses and learn how the world
works but then
how do you know what's what how do you
use that information to help yourself
out well
the next thing we do is now that we
understand things
pretty well uh we go out into the real
world and we're bombarded with a variety
of claims
right and they can come from many many
sources
described in earlier lectures and
basically claims are presented as
notions
hypotheses facts or theories
now factors of theories you don't know
if you have to worry about those are
actionable right away hypotheses take a
little bit of processing and notions
take a whole lot
right so you really what you're asking
is you get a claim and you
asking what does science have to say
about this claim
right and you can use your knowledge of
study design and study number
and you can rank claims between these
categories
of is this a theory right or is it a
fact or is it really just a hypothesis
or really just a notion where who knows
if it's true and if it's not even stated
for
uh very well um and
there more specifically once you
sort of get into categorizing based on
notion hypothesis factor theory
you can zoom in even more and start to
describe things
within those contexts as being very
unlikely
right uh unlikely
possible likely or very likely right
so usually the thing with notions
is that not a whole lot of that can be
parsed out because there's not enough
information
hypotheses you can start to parse out a
little bit more facts are usually
you know very very straightforward and
theories even more so but every time you
get bombarded with a claim
you can sort it through what kind of
claim it is but you can just skip to
how likely is it to be true is it very
likely unlikely possible
likely or very likely so on and so forth
now that's really good if we have
research
on the claims but sometimes we don't
have direct research
what do we do then do we just stop
thinking well we can't
but sometimes you have to make a
decision right can you imagine
being hired to train soccer players in
strength and conditioning
and the coach is like all right so what
do we do in the weight room and you're
like well there's no studies in
program design for soccer players that's
comprehensive so i actually don't know
what well you gotta go on something
right
turns out there's different kinds of
evidence
different alternative approaches to
learning about how the world works
and none of them really as good
as formal scientific data at all but
but some are better than others you can
use
logical inference from existing science
you can say okay there's tons of studies
in the weightlifters powerlifters
volleyball players
basketball players rugby players and
that all kind of paints a very
consistent picture of what's going on
man that's probably a pretty good start
for training soccer players and then
we can use modification monitoring to
see how they're responding change some
things here and there to get a really
good response
so there's no direct research on soccer
players for example but that's okay
because we have other lines of evidence
and we can logically infer that it's a
pretty good transfer or at least
so somewhere to start right we could do
personal observation like well in my
experience the following has worked for
soccer players in the past
there's no studies on it but i think
it's worked pretty well
another good place to start we could go
through tradition it has its value
like you know 50 years of soccer
coaching looks very very similar
especially in the weight room
it's probably not totally wrong and
there's some value to get from that
authority a very very good soccer coach
or strengthening expert can say this is
how things should be done
definitely has its demerits but a
possible place to look
and dogma like stuff that's presented as
a notion
without any evidence without an attempt
for evidence you know
not the greatest thing in the world but
could give you some good ideas because
document's not necessarily
false sometimes can be true so maybe
food for thought in that regard
so it's totally okay to use all of those
approaches
uh if the direct evidence doesn't exist
yet
right but of course direct science is
the best so if you have data on
something use that
but if you don't all these other
approaches tend to work to some degree
better than chance all right so
once we have data once we've analyzed
claims we can eventually if we
understand enough
use science to engineer outcomes
all right we understand the structure of
the world
we can still alter the structure of the
world which you know engineering is
basically defined as the use of science
and technology to alter outcomes
and we get what we want right so for
example if you know how certain soils
deform under pressure then you can
figure out how
big the columns need to be for a
building of a certain height and a
certain weight
because the size of the column's gonna
be okay that's enough force distribution
and the soil is not gonna deform the
building is not gonna topple over
right that's a perfect example of
engineering that's a whole lot of data
and a whole lot of logical inference you
need to use
and uh just guessing doesn't get you
anywhere with that so
super important use of science more
something closer to sport exercise
science
you know if you know how intensity
affects hypertrophy
um you can figure out how long to rest
between sets
right so we know that intensity doesn't
affect hypertrophy a ton
so we don't have to rest like 10 minutes
between sets to get
fully recharged but we know that it
affects it to some pretty decent extent
and that like doing 15 second breaks
between all of your sets
is just to drop your intensity so much
that you're going to see a downside in
hypertrophy
so maybe we get something like a one to
five minutes depending
on the situation hey look that's better
than a random guess by a long shot
right and so a lot of people don't know
that they're just totally unaware of
that and
remind you we know how intensity affects
hypertrophy we also know how metabolites
affect hypertrophy to some extent we
know how volume effects hypertrophy
when all of those things play a role man
we can get our timing
real specific way better than one to
five minutes we have all sorts of logic
trees worked out like well if it's the
following kind of exercise
and it takes you this much to recover
and you can do this many total reps then
you rest for
if you meet these conditions at 45
seconds you rest every 45 seconds
between sets but if it takes you longer
to get all these things checked off the
list you have to take
as long as all of them get checked off
the list then you rest for that long
which might be you know for squats and
deadlifts for a really strong person
could be five minutes could be six and a
half something like that
so all this what we're doing here
is getting signs to alter our reality
because we know the reality really well
we can use science to alter it and get
what we want
that idea using
an understanding of the world by science
to alter the world to make it more like
what we want
is the crown jewel of modern culture
all right it really is like
look at everything good in this world
sort of like love and
i don't know panda bears or something
most of the good things in this world
are borne out by science and evidence
and you know air conditioning vaccines
international travel stable home and
work environments
geez psychology research that tells you
how to interact with
your significant other so that you don't
fight a lot all that stuff
is really just the use of science to
engineer outcomes to make things better
and by measurable outcomes everything in
our world
uh for the most part is getting better
and better all the time because
we're applying all this logic and
evidence and doing a really good job at
them
now you know we're not saving the world
here let's ask the question of how do we
do this
in sport and exercise science okay how
do we apply
our knowledge to alter outcomes in sport
and exercise science how do we become
evidence-based
professionals let's find out well first
what is the current state of science in
social in sport and exercise science
well sport exercise science is a new
subfield of biology and by new we mean
in a time scale of science it's like you
know
maybe 40 years old or something like
that um
so what that what does that mean well
basic mechanisms are understood fairly
well we know that like lifting weights
makes you more jacked we know that it
involves high forces
we know that you know specificity
principle we got pretty well mapped out
we know how endurance adaptations are
made so on and so forth
so when we're training people to be
better at sport
or to use exercise to improve health or
something or other we're like
we're not really lost in the dark
anymore like we know where we're going
now the detailed mechanisms still
have some pretty deep gaps in them for
example the actual process of muscle
growth
like we know parts of it like the
transcription and translation parts we
know pretty well
we know that mtor and a couple of other
pathways have something to do with it
we know that there's mechano transducers
detecting tension
we think that there's uh other detectors
of metabolites or something causing uh
cell
uh hypertrophy but that's not 100 clear
yet or not
not close to that so you know how does
how do we go exactly what happens in the
cell
from lifting weights all the way through
more muscle several days later
there's big missing pieces and once we
figure them out we'll be able to
really fine tune our approach but
because we have the basics we're not
off to a zero start we could definitely
need more research to figure that out
um and so so so the mechanistic side
there's some missing pieces and there's
also a lot of missing applied
recommendations
for pretty big groups of people for
example
training advanced athletes you know
99 of research in sport and exercise and
science is literally just on beginners
or just
man intermediates you're lucky to find
evidence on intermediates like
people who lift one to three years like
that's called trained in exercise
science
in sport science it's not um in exercise
science trained athletes resistance
trained uh individuals or like one to
three years of training right
so if you've been lifting for more than
five years which if you're watching this
there's a pretty good chance you are
it's okay if you're not but if if you
are man there's just not a whole lot of
reason there's like
man like i don't know there's like as
far as intervention studies
there may be less than less than 20
total studies
ever done in resistance training on that
population if it's
real real bad so so that's a really big
missing piece
we're going to have to get a little bit
creative if we're going to try to use as
much science as possible
hint hint we're not going to be able to
just use studies period we're going to
have to expand our scope a little bit so
when you want to use sport extra science
to be a better coach to be a better
trainer to be a better athlete
just the direct evidence is not enough
to go on
unfortunately right there's a difference
like if you're doing experimental
physics man it's all direct evidence and
it's just exactly what you go on and
someone's like well in my experience
people are like what the fuck is wrong
with you there's studies on the stuff
right really really good studies that
trump everyone's experience
um so you know exercise science sport
exercise science is not there yet
but we got some good stuff going for us
let's find out how to
actually be an evidence-based
practitioner in sport and exercise
science
evidence-based contradict a lot of
opinions does not mean pubmed or it's
not true
okay it means a couple of things
when there is strong data available
right strong hypotheses facts or
theories on what you're talking about or
what you want to solve
use direct science plain and simple
so when there's some really good science
on something you go right to that
science and it tells you what to do
problem solved now when there are weak
hypotheses or notions
on something science really hasn't
tested a whole lot
then you go on logical inference here's
an example
okay um let's use number one first
direct science
when available and there are strong
hypotheses facts and theories
um resistance training is the best way
to enhance
muscular adaptations uh hypertrophy wise
yes
confirmed super strong so if someone
asks you hey i want to grow muscle what
should i do should i do like plyometric
workouts or i heard jitsu is good for
that what do you do you say lifting
weights
okay easy and all these the ones that we
know a lot it sounds like i'm like
you know just almost making them up like
this so these it's not that easy like it
really is that easy when you know the
science like the science is super clear
on stuff
it almost seems like a no-brainer but
you know like
in 1900 think about like you know people
would say like well how do i become more
muscular
like lifting weights was barely a thing
some shit people did in circuses
and people say well actually mechanics
have a pretty you know i don't know
tiny guy voice 1920s guy voice like man
mechanics seem to have a pretty muscular
form and maybe you could work in a car
shop thing
like 1900 there was like two car shops
but in any case
like you know people just didn't fucking
know like you just thought like it was
physical training was a thing gymnastics
or something like that
here's a really good example um uh of
the basic science thing
for some reason on instagram and youtube
there's this like group of people
that really love bodyweight exercises
and there's nothing like gymnastics
derivatives
these are almost never real gymnasts and
and um there's nothing wrong with that
but some of them are like really
dogmatic
and uh when when people are like hey i
want to become muscular they get in the
comment section immediately like you
should try body weight exercise or
gymnastics they're the best way to grow
muscle and you're like
no they have their place but just
resistance training period is and
there's nothing wrong at all with using
barbells dumbbells and machines and
they're like no it's all body weight and
you're like
what the fuck is wrong with you like
science has closed that fucking case bro
like
it's resistance applied to the
musculature
that's it it comes from a machine it
comes from barbells doubles whatever
it's whatever tool does the job
better and body weight sometimes awesome
sometimes not great sometimes a real bad
idea
and they'll just fight you tooth and
nail on it so that's an example of
number one like we have the direct
science let me
show you what the fuck your personal
experience says on it like all but it's
all about bodyweight exercises that's
nice guy
on instagram we're gonna go with number
one number two using logical inference
when weak hypotheses or notions are
available
so uh you know weak hypotheses uh
let's say we have um a question of how
often do we train our quads
frequency per week to get maximum
results now we have some pretty good
understanding of general frequency ideas
um but like the number of studies on
quadricep training frequencies like man
it's just not that many it's like by
less than 10
really good studies and um you know the
populations are so different it's a lot
of times it's in beginners
when you ask like you know um gee you
know like what do i do if i'm like been
training five years how often should i
try my quads well
you we know a lot about how frequency
works
because we can logically infer that you
know stimulus recovery adaptation curves
are a thing
and then we sort of say okay if i'm
adequately recovered
and i'm ready to go again and i've
healed and so on and so forth then
you know whenever i recover i can
probably train again that's really good
reasoning it's logical inference right
it's not there's no direct study that
confirms that exact thing in your exact
circumstance
but you'd love logical inferences it's
pretty good like ideally would we have
like
50 different studies on frequency for
quads and different populations and be
like this is exactly the frequency you
should choose given these things like
that would be awesome we just don't have
it yet but that's okay
moving on to number three where do we
use personal observations well
if you start an individual approach to
training with number one and number two
you can use your personal observations
to modify the training and how it's
going
so for example if you know from basic
science
that a hypocaloric condition will make
you lose fat
but a hypochlor condition also risks
muscle loss and strength loss
you can set your deficit a certain
number using direct science
and the logical inference you can alter
your deficit a little bit you say okay
i'm a little bit more muscular more at
risk of losing muscle i have some time
to lose this fat so it's not a rush so
i'm going to set my deficit at like you
know
500 calories per day versus like 750
that it would predict uh you know that
i should start at if i just didn't know
anything about myself on average
then use personal observations to modify
the individual approach as it goes on
so as you're losing fat and as you're
losing weight if you're not getting any
weak or you're actually getting stronger
like fuck i could probably be losing fat
faster than this
you actually increase the deficit but if
like you're really low noticing lower
energy because deficit is so low
then maybe what you want to do is you
know so chop off the depths a little bit
go to 350 or 400 deficit instead of 500
and and see if everything improves and
if it does great using awesome personal
anecdote
um for feedback which is really really
good
if you got none of the above you can use
tradition and authority
right what people have done in the past
and maybe what the best coaches say
uh as starting points for your
intervention
so you basically like trying to be
trying to get a bodybuilding routine
together
you like sort of look at instagram look
on flex magazine and you see like what
do most bodybuilders do oh that okay
and then what do like the best coaches
say you should do and you read some
stuff you know
uh cliff wilson lee norton and stuff and
so okay it's interesting that they have
those opinions
you're going to sort of coalesce it into
uh kind of like a
okay well this is probably what a good
program might look like you start there
and then use personal observation from
there
and then if science comes out saying one
way or the other then you for sure use
science you always try to use science
but in the absence of it you can start
with tradition and authority until the
science comes around
right and what about dogma
some people would say what dogma dogma's
just pointless stupid bullshit they have
a pretty good point
but sometimes dogma is actually carrying
validity
like there's a dogma about squats and
big legs the thing is we don't know if
squats are the king of lag exercises but
a lot of real smart people a lot of real
jack people think that's true
a lot of them don't so who's right well
it's food for thought
so it might be right i wouldn't bet on
it maybe you shouldn't either
but if someone says like hey are squats
like the king for leg exercises you
could be like you know i don't know
about king
but i think they're worth a try yeah
people are dogmatic about them but
that's probably something there
maybe and you people try squats they get
really good technique and their quads
just fucking double in size and they're
like wow fuck man
some shit's happening this is great and
then later the science comes up or
logical inference and you're like wow
this actually makes tons of sense
great that i did this and sometimes
dogma you start up food for thought
you're like man you know there's like
a whole lot of this like dogma about
like autophagy and health intermittent
fasting
it seems like a good idea give it a shot
you know just don't bet on it and you
try the fasting and it turns out like
your workouts kind of suck you have
really shitty energy you know your blood
work comes back you're not really any
healthier than you would have been if
you just lost that weight normally and
you're like
fuck this this is ruining my life or you
love it and it works great
so go based on that but again with dogma
don't put a whole lot of marbles into
that container
lastly so we figured out how to use
evidence-based practice probably
now how do we take this to go um right
there you see and there will be a link
for this below the video one of the best
articles online
it might be the best article just single
article
i've ever read that's saying a lot for
me anyway
so it's saying jack shit uh
it's called critical thinking what is it
good for in fact what is it
by i believe the gentleman's name is
howard and
he defines critical thinking as the use
of rational skills
world views and values to get as close
as possible to the truth
critical thinking is science to go
and if you want to be a scientist in
mind in an action
wherever you are outside of a laboratory
you can take critical thinking with you
and always come
to the more likely conclusions than the
less likely conclusions
let's take a look at these three
sub-components of critical thinking
the values dimension worldview dimension
and the skills dimension rational skills
so values
the values of critical thinking the
value of critical thinking is
you want to get to the truth and that's
more important than defending your
biases or those of others
what does that really mean what is an
example of that
here's the deal you could be
really attached to a certain idea you
really want it to be true
but every time you examine it it seems
like it might not be true
how much do you value critical thinking
can be measured
by how quickly you go you know what
maybe this idea is not true
i'm going to try to be as open-minded as
possible people who have a value of
critical thinking
have no sacred cows by definition
now they have cows that have been very
well vetted by the research and they
think that it's very likely to be
correct
but if you talk to someone who let's say
um
is a theoretical physicist and the big
bang theory is very likely that it
actually
happened pretty close to the way it's
described if you say hey is there a 100
chance the big bang theory happened like
can you be convinced that it didn't
every theoretical physicist that is
worth their weight is gonna be like
yeah i can totally be convinced it's not
uh what happened but i'd need some
fucking damn good evidence
right but there's nobody like there's no
way i can believe
that x y and z is true if someone says
there's no way that this can be false
you're probably talking to someone who
does not value critical thinking
that's it and if you want to value
critical thinking a lot
you have to just be super open-minded
right not so open-minded that your brain
falls out so you're still willing to
design categories
but you have to look at the evidence
very objectively in whichever way the
evidence or the logic or the reasoning
leads
that's the way you follow and if it's a
way you don't super like
maybe you go there this comes in super
handy for example in
interpersonal relationships imagine
you're arguing with your brother and
your sister
and they're like you know you've been a
real dick to me over the last couple of
months and i don't know why what's your
first inclination
no i fucking haven't right but then if
you really value critical thinking you
take a look at what's happening you
listen to them
you sort of try to tabulate what you did
and really cut yourself no slack
not cut away slack but cut yourself no
slack and you
you might just by following the evidence
be like you know what man
i really i i owe you an apology and i
owe you a promise to be better because i
really have been a dick
or even if that's what they want to hear
but you honestly your honest assessment
is that you haven't been a dick you're
like you know i'm super willing to hear
you out on this and i think you might be
right
i'm not sure i'll try to be better and
that's all i can promise
or you know for a fact they're trying to
manipulate you for some more bullshit
hopefully
you know you're not related then maybe
they're just some person you're arguing
with at work or something like that
but you know if they if they're saying
you know you've been a super bad person
if you give it like a logical analysis i
mean there's just no
way you can come to that conclusion on
just totally objective grounds
you still value critical thinking that
doesn't mean you need to value being so
open-minded that you're constantly just
doubting yourself
it means you just need a calm cool even
analysis
and you need to apply your skills in
order to be able to have that analysis
be likely to choose it wherever it leads
that's where you follow now
notice i said skills okay we'll get to
skills in a second
just because you have a value system in
which you accept all truth that is
revealed to you through science
and through evidence and through logic
that doesn't mean you have the skills to
pick it up we'll talk about that in a
sec but before that world view so the
world view dimension is
basically saying that the world is
complex and things are not always what
they seem
but sometimes they are so it's not a
conspiracy theorist view
and a careful analysis yields better
conclusions
there are two extremes that do not
conform to this view
that i can think of at least one extreme
is just being very uh just credulous for
lack of a better term
high degree of credulity so
people tell you shit and you're like oh
okay like uh
some people that watch like dr oz he's
like blueberries cure cancer and they're
like
cool they're like do you just believe
everything everyone tells you they're
like yeah
sure you're like what like they probably
still believe in santa claus and ghosts
and shit like that right
definitely a bad deal on the other end
of the spectrum there's no shortcuts in
critical thinking
e are conspiracy theorists who always
think nothing is as it seems
um sometimes shit is as it seems like
when you can't pick up you know 90 pound
dumbbell and you've been training for
years and you're a large male
you really are fucking weak it is no
conspiracy
logically you're just not that strong
i'm sorry right so you took the
standardized test and you suck at it you
studied for four months and you still
suck
you're not so good at standardized tests
and maybe not the sharpest tool machine
it's totally fine right but
that's just what it is right it's not
like some conspiracies or the test is
wrong or something maybe
maybe but that's not your number one
guess so the world view
of critical thinking basically says like
things are potentially very complex
and things are not always clear so we
have to carefully analyze what is coming
into us from observation
um and only the careful analysis
is what's going to increase our chance
of being correct so
when you're a critical thinker you don't
question everything even
obvious shit and you don't uh you know
question
nothing you do your line of questioning
based on the complexity of the situation
and everything gets questioned at least
a little bit as it passes the questions
you can ease up on it and direct your
attention elsewhere
right so world is a complex place and
you have to approach it with a reverence
for that
lastly and very importantly is there a
skills
dimension the rational skills we're
saying in the values dimension
that um you have to be able to calm down
and analyze what's going on if you
really value learning the truth
and in the worldview dimension we say
look the world's pretty fucking complex
so that ability to analyze is critical
because you're gonna need it because the
world doesn't just give you facts and
nor is it trying to lie to you all the
time you got to actually think
the skills dimension is the ability to
do that thinking
is the parsing out quieting the mind and
quieting the biases
systematically analyzing effects being
wary of confounders
right reading and applying science
reasonably and properly if you're
skilled at that
you can potentially be a really good
critical thinker notice i said
potentially
people who are trial lawyers or take the
trial or approach to life
can have unbelievable rational skills
but their value is not to get to the
truth their value is to get to a biased
account that they like
they will write fucking books articles
tomes they'll argue in congress about
sheer
bullshit and they're so fucking smart
and there's so many ways they
weave in and out of logical paradigms to
try to sell you something that's
fucking garbage people say like are
smart people more likely to be right
than dumb people
yes but it's not an inoculation because
smart people
sometimes just have really really
impressive ways to weave about bullshit
if a smart person tries to bullshit you
it's going to be the most complicated
intricate
beautiful bullshit you've ever seen in
your life it's still fucking wrong
so you can have an unbelievable rational
skill set and have no
value or very low value of critical
thinking and just not
do it right there's people you know
defending
like naturopathic medicine that are
fucking super smart they're using
chemistry and fucking biology and all
this other stuff and misinterpreting
studies
on purpose because they don't want to
see the truth that it's bullshit
right and there's dumber people than
them by a long shot being like that
smells like dumb shit i think it's wrong
i mean they can't really justify it they
can't rationalize it but they're fucking
right
right and then of course the world need
to mention is look even if you have
unbelievable rational skills
if you really just tend to believe
everything you hear you have never used
those skills
and if you're a conspiracy theorist you
use the skills to an absolutely absurd
degree and attack things that don't
attack non-enemies right and you always
think oh it's no no it's more
complicated than that like
no no this is how it is like no it can't
be true
and then you're so smart that you weave
all these like you look up like a 911
conspiracy theories i'm like why did the
plane
have two booms and these people saw
missile and you know jet fuel and steel
beams and all these like thermodynamic
calculations are like oh my god like you
really just don't want to believe
reality
like sweet like you're the man that's
you know some of those people
very skilled rationally they're super
smart super critical and they're
thinking
but i'm sorry it's not super critical
they're super uh you know technical in
their thinking super powerful in
thinking
but they don't have the worldview
dimension or they don't have a value
dimension you need
all three you need all three and i would
say
values dimensions probably the most
important one because if you don't give
enough of a shit to even try to parse
out what's true and what's not
fuck it who cares right it doesn't
matter the worldview dimension
is probably the second most important
right because
if you value the truth and you know the
truth isn't easy to find
at least you're not going to conclude a
bunch of shit that's wrong and when you
know you don't know some shit you're
going to back up and be like
ah somebody else expert can we get some
consensus on this
if you have unbelievable rational skills
that magnifies your ability to apply
your values in the proper world view but
if you have rational skills and no
values or worldview you apply them in
the fucking wrong direction all the time
it's like
what's more important for a superhero to
be
good or powerful good because a good
person
might not be let's say hero not
superhero a good person can still be
here even if they're not very powerful
they can drag someone out of a car
accident they can
get in the way of a line of fire and
take a bullet for someone you know they
can help someone across the street
uh what about powerful well you can be
powerful and evil as fuck
and so that just you know the goodness
determines which way you point your
goodness gun
you know if it's or you know what you
just sort of point your powers
how much power you have just just how
much effect you have but it could easily
be negative so
a lot of times people say oh man that
guy's a great critical thinking he's so
smart
well smart is a good part of the package
but smart
also has to come with the intention of
being a critical thinker
in a world you know is complicated and
requires critical thinking if one of
those is missing
the whole package doesn't work all that
well so you have to cultivate all three
and you can actually look up authors of
articles various like politics is the
easy one
politics sociology you read an article
and you can actually rank the author on
like which one of those they suck at or
which ones they're good at
be like values dimensions great
worldview is great rational skills suck
more times than not people who actually
put articles online their rational
skills are fucking
awesome their worldview sucks right or
their values suck
one of the two you have to have all of
them when you have all of them and these
are things that can change they can be
cultivated they can be grown by you with
practice
trying to learn to do better what you
can do is
basically get better at taking the
systematic approach
of seeing the world anywhere that you
are and making the best decisions you
can
with your food with your training with
motivation
anything to do with support and exercise
science better than that anything to do
with all of life's decisions how come
science is the shit
because of shit like that folks thank
you so much for tuning in this course
sorry for swearing so much but i figure
we're all adults we're cool with it
see you next time
