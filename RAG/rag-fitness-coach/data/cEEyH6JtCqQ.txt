but this is a highly effective way to
pack on overall size and strength and
it's a method that you really just can't
go wrong with
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to share with you my
top
recommended progression method to use
for hypertrophy training in my view
it's the most efficient way to increase
your overall strength levels and since
size and strength are pretty much
directly correlated it's also going to
be the quickest way to gain muscle as
well now some people out there will say
that it's not
important to track your workouts or that
progressive overload isn't necessary to
build muscle
however they are wrong progressive
overload is
the underlying driver of the entire
muscle building process and by tracking
your workouts objectively you're going
to achieve progressive overload in the
most efficient way so all these programs
that you see out there
or maybe even ones that you've purchased
where someone just gives you a workout
and says
do three sets of 10 reps for each
exercise that is not very helpful since
they're not giving you a structured plan
on how to move forward with that program
and how to progress from week to week in
the most efficient way which is critical
when it comes to gaining muscle
now before i lay this method out for you
since this video is definitely going to
help you make
muscle gains at a faster rate please do

different progression schemes that you
can use they're all effective in their
own right
so i am not saying that this is the only
way to do things but based on my
experience and my coaching
and on what just makes the most sense i
would say that dynamic double
progression is what i would recommend
assuming you're like the vast majority
of people watching this meaning
uh you're not some sort of high level uh
strength athlete following a
reverse auto regulatory undulating gpp
wave
periodization block cube whatever thing
trying to get your deadlift from
620 pounds up to 630. okay this is for
the typical everyday lifter out there
who wants to gain muscle
get strong and have a top i'd say one to
two percent physique but isn't
necessarily competing or trying to get
to an elite level um you really don't
need anything fancy
and you can make basic linear progress
and probably build the majority of the
muscle you're ever going to build
using this one model alone this is how
i've personally been training for
the majority of my lifting career it's
actually how i started out training
um at the age of 13 in my parents
basement with my
trusty set of sand filled walmart weight
plates but i had no idea back then that
it was called
dynamic double progression i didn't even
know what double progression was
i just trained this way because it made
the most intuitive sense to me
and i've played around with a variety of
different approaches over the years
but this is the one that i always come
back to because it is very effective and
very reliable
so double progression what does that
mean very simply it just means that
you're adjusting
two different variables as you progress
through your training which are weight
and reps you have a given rep range
uh let's use eight to ten reps as an
example here um and let's say you're
doing
three sets of a given exercise so your
first goal
is to train for additional reps with
whatever weight you're using
then once you can hit the upper end of
your rep range across
all three sets so in this case it would
be 10 reps
you would increase the weight and start
the process over again so maybe
it looks something like this as an
example for workout one
on the first set you do a hundred pounds
for ten reps then let's say on the
second set you get nine reps
and on the third set eight reps workout
number two you come back and you do a
hundred pounds for ten reps
then you get 10 reps on the second set
this time and then nine reps on the
third
now for workout number three you do 10
reps across all three sets
so now for workout 4 you add 5 to 10
pounds depending on the exercise
and maybe again you do 10 reps 9 reps 8
reps and you just keep progressing
forward like this
so you train for reps and then once you
can do 10 reps across all three sets
you bump up the weight and you go back
to training for reps again and keep in
mind that these rep counts are just
examples
the number of reps that you lose or
don't lose from set to set that's going
to depend on exactly how hard you're
training
and your strength levels on any given
day so that's a basic double progression
model okay pretty straightforward and it
does work well
now with dynamic double progression
you're going to do things a little bit
differently
and that's that you don't have to hit
the upper end of your rep range across
all three sets before you go ahead and
increase the weight
instead what you're going to do is
maintain the same relative effort level
across all three sets
what i recommend is about one to two
reps short of failure um if you're
thinking in terms of rpe then that would
be
an rpe of about eight to nine and you're
going to use
the first set of each exercise as your
main gauge for progression
so the first set is the one that you
really focus on and that you really use
to determine when it's time to add more
weight
as soon as you can hit the upper end of
your rep range on that first set
then the following workout you'll
increase the weight on that first set
and then for the remaining sets of that
exercise you can reduce the weight if
necessary
in order to stay within your targeted
rep range you don't have to use the same
weight
across every single set with this
approach so here's an example of what
this might look like again we're going
to use a rep range of 8 to 10
with three sets for the lift so for
workout number one you do a hundred
pounds for eight reps
and since you're at the bottom end of
that eight to ten rep range you decrease
the weight slightly to stay within the
range so for set number two
uh you do 95 pounds for say nine reps
and then 95 pounds for eight reps
workout number two you do a hundred
pounds for nine reps
and now since you got nine reps you can
probably get eight on the second set
until you stick with a hundred pounds
and you do eight reps now you're at the
bottom end of the range so you decrease
to 95 pounds
and you get nine reps workout number
three you do a hundred pounds for ten
reps then a hundred pounds for nine reps
then a hundred pounds for eight reps
and now for workout four since you got a
hundred pounds for ten reps on that
first set
you increase to 105 okay you don't
continue using 100 pounds
on the other two sets and wait until
they all reach 10 reps like you would
with the previous double progression
model
so now you do 105 pounds for 8 reps
you're at the bottom end of the range so
you drop down to 100 pounds for 9 reps
and then a hundred pounds for eight reps
workout number five you do 105 pounds
for nine reps then 105 pounds for eight
reps and then you drop down to a hundred
pounds and you do
nine reps
so hopefully you get the idea here again
you're using the first set of the
exercise
as your primary gauge for when to add
more weight and once you can hit the
upper end of your rep range
on that first set you increase the
weight on the first set for the
following workout
and then from there if you need to drop
the weight down slightly on
one or both of the following sets uh to
stay within your targeted rep range
since
um it's normal to lose a rep or two if
you're really training hard enough then
that's totally fine
so again both the basic double
progression approach
and the dynamic double progression
approach uh they're both effective
but with the dynamic model i would say
that you'll likely progress
faster in the overall picture because
you're keeping the relative effort level
the same across all of your sets
rather than allowing the effort level to
drop on the first or second set or maybe
even the third and fourth set
if you're doing uh say four to five sets
for an exercise
for example if you're using the first
model and you do 10 reps
nine reps eight reps for workout one and
then you do
uh 10 reps 10 reps nine reps on workout
two if you've already done
uh 10 reps on the first set two weeks in
a row then i would say that you're
leaving progress on the table
by once again going back for week three
and doing the exact same thing on that
first set
when you are fully fresh and when your
strength is at its highest
and you're only leaving that progression
to that third and final
set the relative effort on that first
set is dropping from week to week
as you wait for the subsequent sets to
catch up in reps whereas with dynamic
double progression you're maintaining
the same effort level across all of your
sets and so you can see exactly how your
strength is progressing on every set
and you're giving yourself an
opportunity across every set to progress
now technically you could use whatever
rep range you want for this but i
generally like to use rep ranges that
have a gap
of two reps so maybe five to seven reps
uh six to eight
eight to ten ten to twelve because
usually i find that when you do increase
the weight whether it's five to ten
pounds on a compound lift or two and a
half to five pounds
uh on an isolation usually you'll lose
about two reps with each
increase not always that's just a
general guideline um you can
use larger gaps that's totally fine but
if you're doing
uh say six to ten reps per set then when
you do get to ten reps you can apply a
larger weight increase
and also keep in mind that it's not the
end of the world if you misjudge things
and you end up
outside of your targeted rep range
slightly so if your rep range is
six to eight and on the first set you
lift uh 200 pounds for seven reps and
you feel like you can still get six on
that next set
with 200 pounds and so you stick with
that weight uh but you only get five
reps that's not a big deal
it doesn't have to be perfect or if on
one workout you do
a certain weight for seven reps so the
following week you come back in with
that same weight and you're targeting
the upper end of the rep range so you're
aiming
for eight reps if you just happen to be
particularly strong on that day and
you're able to get nine
then go for nine okay don't just stop at
eight because your rep range on paper
is six to eight reps the goal is to
train one to two reps short of failure
on the majority of your sets
regardless of what you think you should
be getting so this isn't going to be
perfect okay it's just a general model
you have a given rep range once you hit
the upper end of that rep range on the
first set
then you increase the weight the next
workout on that first set and then you
adjust the weight if necessary on the
remaining sets
to stay within your targeted rep range
and the whole thing just gradually moves
forward over time
it's not the only way of doing this and
as you get more advanced
there are other ways to apply
progressive overload besides just adding
more weight and more reps but this is a
highly effective way to pack on overall
size and strength
and it's a method that you really just
can't go wrong with and if you want to
