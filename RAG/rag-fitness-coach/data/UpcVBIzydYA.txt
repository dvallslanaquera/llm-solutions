what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i'm going to be
revealing to you the single
best bicep exercise you can perform for
building bigger
more muscular arms because if there's
one thing lacking when it comes to
youtube fitness
clearly it's videos that discuss how to
train your biceps it's just
not a subject that gets the attention it
deserves and it's definitely something
that needs to be talked about more often
given just how critical bicep exercise
selection really is
when it comes to either achieving
amazing results or absolutely
killing your gains now before i get
started if you're new here and you want

to enter in for that
so what is the best direct bicep
exercise you can do to build your arms
as quickly as possible
now all jokes aside hopefully most of
you understood the sarcasm in that
introduction
but it's pretty much any basic curling
exercise that allows you to activate
your biceps effectively
train them through a full range of
motion and achieve progressive overload
over time in some capacity
i know that's not very exciting but my
goal here is to simplify things for you
down to the steps that actually matter
in the real world and not to just add
extra steps that don't need to be there
in order to sound
unique this is about getting you actual
real world results
find a curling exercise or two that are
comfortable on your joints
that allow you to use a full range of
motion and that you can slowly and
gradually add weight and reps to over
time
if you do that and you take the bulk of
your sets within a rep or two of true
muscular failure
okay you do enough total volume i'd say
somewhere between about four to eight
direct curling sets per week give or
take and that's usually enough for most
people and you train with a high enough
frequency
so directly training the biceps roughly
twice a week give or take and then you
just combine
that with all of your compound pulling
movements for back and you get
progressively stronger on those lifts
okay if you do those basic things
consistently you've essentially done
the vast majority of what you need to do
to maximize the growth of your biceps
and from there genetics are going to
influence just how big your arms can
ultimately get
as well as what your biceps actually
look like aesthetically so whether you
have shorter biceps with a taller peak
or longer biceps that are a bit flatter
or something in between
okay despite all these bicep peak
building videos that you find on youtube
that is almost entirely a matter of
genetics and it's almost entirely
outside of your control
and it's not going to change based on
exercise selection or form
and so your main focus should just be on
building up overall biceps mass
and then allowing your genetics to take
care of the rest
yes there are certain little form tweaks
you can apply to fully optimize the
tension on your biceps 100
and some curling variations are going to
be better suited to you than others so
that's something that you can experiment
with
but when it all comes down to it these
things are not going to have
a major impact on your bottom line bicep
gains at the end of the year and it's
not something that needs to be over
complicated and over
analyzed to death like so many of these
bicep training videos on youtube try to
do
today i'm gonna show you three tips for
bigger biceps all right so today we're
gonna go over how to peek that bicep out
there are a few
key things you can do to further improve
the width of your biceps
so today i truly have the number one tip
for building bigger biceps today i'm
going to show you an extremely important
tip about biceps training today we're
focusing on the bicep
bicep bicep biceps [ __ ]
biceps this is just a subject that gets
way overemphasized
and the reason why this endless stream
of different curling variations exists
on youtube is because
most beginning lifters place huge
importance on the idea of building
bigger biceps
and so it's an easy way for channels to
get views and subscribers even though
the biceps are a relatively small
and simple muscle group that don't
contribute to your overall physique
nearly as much as the larger muscle
groups do and then in addition to this
it's also because content creators need
to keep coming up with these new
variations and
bicep training hacks in order to keep
their existing viewers interested
because if they really told the truth
about how straightforward
this subject really is they would
quickly run out of things to talk about
you know i understand
the reasons for putting out these types
of videos but for the most part it's
just unnecessary information
for the people who are actually
consuming that content and then aside
from that
the other possible reason is because
many of the content creators out there
just aren't very knowledgeable in the
first place and they genuinely believe
that you need seven different bicep
exercises in your plan and 15 different
form tweaks
in order to make any gains what's going
on guys in today's video i got
seven different bicep exercises for
anybody looking to get bigger
arms and i'm a content creator myself
and so i fully understand
the reason why most people talk about
arm training so often okay i'm not
saying this is the last arm training
video i'll ever make
you know sometimes you just have to
create that type of mass appeal content
to bring viewers in
so that they can then find their way to
your other more impactful content
but the plain fact is that a good
portion of the advice given in these
videos
just does not matter in the real world
and not only that but if done to excess
then it can potentially actually be
harmful in the sense that it diverts
your focus away from the most important
thing when it comes to building bigger
biceps which has nothing to do
with which specific type of curl you
perform and instead
has everything to do with achieving
progressive overload on
your compound pulley movements for back
because that's actually where
the bulk of your bicep growth is going
to come from which i've talked about
many many times before
you know every time you do a pull-up a
pull-down or a row
you're performing elbow flexion which is
the primary function of the biceps and
so as you add weight to those movements
over time
your biceps are going to have no choice
but to consistently grow along with it
probably something like
maybe 75 as a minimum maybe up to as
high as even 90
of your net bicep growth is going to be
the result of building up your strength
on vertical and horizontal pulling
exercises
and then your direct bicep exercises are
more of an extra add-on to round out
that last bit of growth
and then whatever other tiny little
forum cues and specific curling
variations you use
that will probably account for the last
few percent so i'm not saying that
experimenting with different curling
variations and form tweaks i'm not
saying that that's going to have no
impact at all
um and i have covered tips for proper
bicep curling form here on this channel
and on my instagram
and it's probably something that i'll do
again at some point since it's been
years since i've discussed it but most
people get this whole thing backwards
so they think that choosing the perfect
bicep exercise
and twisting their pinky x degrees to
the right while squeezing their biceps
at the top
for 1.3 seconds and then pronating their
wrist while lowering the weight in
3.7 seconds at the bottom or whatever
okay they think that
these sorts of things are what's most
important for building bigger arms when
actually those tiny little tweaks are
probably the least important thing and
the most important thing
is just that you build a good strength
foundation on compound back exercises
and then perform a basic curling
movement or two afterwards
it can be a simple barbell curl an easy
curl bar
seated or standing dumbbell curl incline
dumbbell curl cable curl
preacher curl machine curl these are all
acceptable choices at the end of the day
and if you're executing these
exercises with proper form and achieving
steady progression in some form
then i really don't think in the grand
scheme it's gonna make
much of a difference which exact
variations you select especially if
you're performing
more than one of them yeah if you only
ever did one bicep exercise for the rest
of your life
then maybe you might miss out on a small
bit of growth but if you're doing two or
even three bicep curling variations in
your program like most people are doing
or at least rotating between different
variations over time
and you're not performing them like a
total [ __ ] so your form is decent
uh to make sure that the majority of the
tension is directed to your biceps
then your bases are going to be covered
as far as bicep growth is concerned
for 100 optimal growth and this would be
more important for slightly more
advanced lifters where
attention to detail does become more
important the only thing you might want
to consider is doing one variation with
your elbows positioned further back
like an incline dumbbell curl or a
single arm cable curl
since that will emphasize the stretch
position and then do one with your
elbows a bit further forward
maybe a preacher curl type movement in
order to emphasize the shortened
position since the bicep also performs
shoulder flexion and so as your bicep
or sorry as your elbow travels forward
and more overhead
you're actually going to be able to
contract the bicep more forcefully
but bottom line guys effective bicep
training is pretty straightforward and
through a combination of proper back
training
and a basic curling exercise or two
added in with proper form
your arms will pretty much grow to their
full potential if you're training with
sufficient intensity
volume and frequency and you're
achieving progressive overload over time
and all these you know super clickbaity
bicep training videos plastered all over
youtube
those might be tempting to watch but at
the end of the day most of the
information in these videos beyond the
basics
