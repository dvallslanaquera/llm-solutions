if you are going to experiment with a
ketogenic diet make sure you pay close
attention to that
because if you don't then not only are
you going to feel like garbage but it
could be potentially dangerous as well
what's up guys sean aliwani

and in this video today i'm going to be
sharing with you my eight-week
experiment
following a ketogenic diet so i'm gonna
explain what a ketogenic diet is
why i decided to give it a try uh what
my specific daily meals were
the results that i experienced in terms
of fat loss muscle growth
training performance hunger and energy
whether or not i'll continue following
the ketogenic diet moving forward and
whether or not i recommend that you
yourself give it a try
and if you enjoy the style of video
where i experiment with different things
and report my results
then go ahead and give this video a like
and also let me know in the comments
what you'd specifically like to see me
cover next
so first off what is a ketogenic diet
basically the main characteristic
is that it's a very low-carb diet okay
protein and fat aside
that's the most fundamental aspect a
ketogenic diet restricts carbohydrates
down to a low enough level
usually less than uh 10 of total
calories or around 30 grams of net carbs
per day or less
net carbs meaning total carbs minus
fiber though different sources will give
slightly different recommendations but
in any case in that state
in that very low carb state your body
will start producing what are called
ketones
and shift away from using glucose as a
primary energy source
and start using fat for fuel instead now
there are different schools of thought
when it comes to fat and protein some
will say that protein
needs to be moderated as well because
too much protein will stimulate a
process called
gluconeogenesis where protein gets
converted into glucose
and that that will kick you out of
ketosis whereas others will say
that gluconeogenesis is such an
inefficient process that as long as
carbs are low enough then eating more
protein isn't going to be a problem
since your body will still
preferentially stick to using fat for
fuel regardless but in any case a
ketogenic diet is usually
very low carb high fat and then protein
is somewhere in the middle and
personally
i had 10 of my calories coming from
carbs 30
from protein and then 70 of the calories
from fat now secondly why did i decide
to give this a try
uh well simply put i just wanted to see
what would happen i'm a fitness coach
and i think it's good to
uh sort of experiment with different
things to gain more insight into them
so that i can give you guys the best uh
advice possible um it also makes for
good content
and the one thing that i was
specifically interested in was the
appetite suppression effect that i kept
hearing so much about
um lately i've been trying to stay a bit
on the leaner side and so i was curious
to see if a ketogenic diet
might help me maintain a lower calorie
intake more easily
next question what specific meals did i
eat on this diet
well i'm definitely a creature of habit
and i usually eat pretty much the same
things
every day no matter what type of diet
i'm following and so this keto diet
was no different and when i'm cutting
which i was doing during this whole
experiment i was eating in a calorie
deficit
in that case i also like to keep things
very repetitive so that i can easily
track my calorie
intake so i pretty much ate the same
three basic meals every day with only
some slight variation here and there
meal number one was typically salmon
with a big serving of different
vegetables
here i've got asparagus cucumber
cauliflower and beetroot and then i
would have a bowl of bone broth on the
side
meal number two would be steak and eggs
with more veggies this is broccoli
mushrooms and pumpkin
and then i'd usually melt a bit of
cheese on top of this as well and i
would flavor it with sriracha
and then meal number three and this is
definitely not the best picture
but it was a protein avocado pudding so
avocado blended up with chocolate whey
protein and cinnamon i'd add a bit of
melted ghee on top which is kind of
similar to butter
there's some macadamia nuts there and
then a very small handful of blueberries
and whipped cream on top
i was very strict with my macros overall
i didn't slip up and sneak in any extra
carbs at any point
and i also used a blood monitor as well
to make sure that i was in fact
consistently staying in ketosis
and this diet added up to around 2000
calories per day which for me and my
body weight and my activity level
is a good amount for cutting all right
now probably the question you're most
interested in
which is what were my results so let's
start with body composition okay this is
what i looked like
before starting the diet um i was around
172 pounds and i was definitely carrying
more fat than usual
my training and diet was not the best
around this time though keep in mind
that this is also
a relaxed picture and it's also not the
best lighting and then this is where i
ended up around 162 pounds so
i would say that the cut was definitely
a success um i clearly lost a decent
amount of fat
and based on my experience i would say
that it occurred at about the same rate
as it would
uh for any other normal cut i wouldn't
say that i noticed any special fat
burning benefits from keto
um although eight weeks is a fairly
short period keep in mind but just based
on this eight week experiment and based
on what i've researched
in the literature there doesn't seem to
be an inherent fat loss advantage
to a ketogenic diet when the total
calories for the day are equated
it's definitely effective for fat loss
as long as the calorie deficit is there
but i don't see any reason at this point
to think that it's more effective okay
when it all comes down to it the calorie
deficit
is really the primary factor no matter
what type of diet you're following
yes a ketogenic diet does cause your
body to preferentially use
fat for fuel which sounds like a great
selling point on the surface but you
also have to keep in mind that you're
consuming
a significantly higher amount of dietary
fat as well um i would say that
i did lose a noticeable amount of muscle
fullness and i would say that i looked a
bit flatter than i normally would
during a short cut like this and that's
not really surprising because when you
heavily restrict carbs
you're going to lose a decent chunk of
muscle glycogen and for every gram of
glycogen that you lose you're also going
to lose
three grams of water along with it so
that was to be expected
and also from what i understand over the
longer term your body will actually
adapt to this
and glycogen levels will end up being
restocked to normal levels because your
body can actually convert
triglycerides into glucose and that's
another thing to note
which is that one of the reasons why a
lot of people will just rave about how
effective a keto diet is for fat loss
is because they're just dropping a bunch
of water weight without realizing it and
so the number on the scale is
quickly going down and it's really
encouraging to see that even though
that's mainly just a result of
water weight loss now what about energy
levels
first off i definitely did experience
what's called the keto flu
during that first week where i felt
extremely lethargic like lethargic to
the point where standing up
to walk across the room was a serious
task that i pretty much felt like i
needed a spotter for
and my understanding is that this is
mainly caused by low electrolyte levels
which is common on keto since the
electrolytes get flushed out
as your body loses that fluid but after
that first week and once i got those
electrolyte levels back up
after that point i would say that
despite being on such an extremely low
carb intake
my energy levels actually felt
completely fine or at least they didn't
feel
any lower than they would be during any
other standard cutting phase
and interestingly i also didn't see any
clear decrease in lifting strength
other than maybe the last rep or two of
a given lift
with a certain weight being a bit more
difficult but that's pretty normal
during any cutting phase but
yeah it was definitely very interesting
to see that despite being on
only 30 grams of net carbs per day all
of my lifts pretty much stayed the same
which also indicates that i was probably
maintaining my lean muscle mass just
fine as well
and then lastly as far as hunger goes uh
the part that i was most curious about
in my personal case i didn't notice any
clear hunger suppression effect
in comparison to a normal cutting phase
even though my overall calorie intake
was the same at around 2000 calories
now maybe longer term that might have
changed maybe
at maintenance the effects of that are
more pronounced i'm not really sure
but that appetite suppression effect
that i was hoping for just wasn't really
there i was still hungry just like i
would be
during any normal fat loss phase i still
craved carbohydrates
so either keto doesn't have that
specific effect for me
or maybe i needed to tweak something
maybe if i went even deeper into ketosis
maybe that would have helped i was
eating around 50 grams of carbs in total
per day with 30 grams of net carbs
i've seen some people recommend 20 grams
of net carbs or less so maybe that would
have changed things
but over the eight weeks at those
specific macros that i was following
i didn't experience that particular
benefit so next question will i continue
using a ketogenic diet
uh the answer at least for now is that
no i won't because
personally i just don't have any good
reason to as far as i can see
i don't have anything against ketogenic
diets for the people who enjoy them
but for me i didn't experience any
special benefits where i would have any
real strong reason to continue
especially since i enjoy eating carbs
and as long as the bulk of those carbs
are coming from
nutrient-dense minimally processed
sources then i don't have any real
problem with them and i definitely
prefer
the dietary freedom of not having to
worry about staying
under 30 grams of net carbs per day
because you really have to be conscious
of what you're eating
in order to do that you'd be shocked at
how quickly the carbs add up
and also eating out on the go is
definitely more of a challenge in that
case and then lastly
do i recommend that you yourself give
keto a try
well ultimately you'll just have to do
your own research and decide for
yourself
there is a subset of people out there
who follow ketogenic diets who stick to
them over the long term and have
nothing but good things to say about
them those people are definitely a
minority because
at the end of the day it is a pretty
extreme way of eating regardless of what
anyone says or at least
let's say it's extreme compared to what
most of us would consider normal and
compared to what most of us have been
doing
throughout most of our lives but if you
want to see how you function mentally
see if it does suppress your diet or
whatever else then that's your call
and there also seems to be a subset of
people who report that
keto diets have been really helpful for
them in terms of controlling
inflammation and reducing autoimmune
symptoms
i'm not an expert in that area but if
you fall into that category
that could be another reason to
investigate it as a
possible option the only thing i would
say though is that if you're going to do
a keto diet you need to do it properly
okay it's not an
easy diet for most people to just jump
right into especially if you don't have
solid previous experience when it comes
to calorie and macro tracking so first
you need to make sure you're actually
restricting carbs down to a low enough
level
in order to stay in ketosis again those
carbs will add up very quickly
and if you're not actually getting into
ketosis then you won't be following an
actual ketogenic diet that's where the
name
ketogenic diet comes from and in that
case you won't be able to judge its
effects
secondly you need to understand that
calories still matter whether you're on
a keto diet or not so if you're using
this diet for fat loss purposes you
still need to create a calorie deficit
okay there's nothing magical about keto
in terms of fat loss it doesn't
override thermodynamics and if you're
just aggressively pouring oil and butter
on top of everything you're eating
in huge quantities and you're just
stuffing your face with bacon and
sausage and cheese all day long
you're not going to lose fat even if you
are in ketosis
and then lastly very importantly you
need to pay attention to your
electrolyte intake and make sure that
you're getting enough
sodium potassium and magnesium each day
when you follow a ketogenic diet
you're going to lose a lot of water
weight and with that you're also going
to experience electrolyte loss
like i mentioned before and if you don't
replace those electrolytes you're going
to open yourself up to a variety of
potential side effects
i won't give concrete recommendations
for that you can research that on your
own
but i think that's something that isn't
talked about enough by the people who
are promoting keto diets
so thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
this if you want to give keto a try then
that's up to you
