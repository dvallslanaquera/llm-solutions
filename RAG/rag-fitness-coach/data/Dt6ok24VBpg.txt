hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
in though you can't see it in the shot
sunny las vegas nevada
yep living here for a year with my wife
because she has a medical fellowship and
i just
sort of show up uh i don't have a day
job uh
las vegas great place in spanish it
means the vegas
i know what a kooky joke folks enough of
my bullshit humor
let's get into the real stuff how to
deload
for two separate aspects of training for
hypertrophy training
and or for strength training because
there's some different applications
but before we get into the differences
let's take a look at the commonalities
and start with the purpose of deloading
why are we deloading
at all there's two things that we need
to be concerned with
with deloading one is the reason we are
deloading the most important by far
is that we have accumulated fatigue over
the last
several number of weeks of training
usually four to eight weeks if you're
training hard enough and progressing
you will accumulate so much fatigue that
your training is no longer maximally
productive or anywhere close
or not productive at all this
accumulated fatigue has to be
dropped so that you can again begin
another accumulation phase of harder and
harder training to get you more jacked
or stronger
that's the thing fatigue accumulates
period if you're training hard enough
and every now and again
you have to let it go it's just just
like you don't work for
you know 50 days straight with no
weekends you got to take some time off
have a breather just like sleep you get
tired and tired tired you have to sleep
and it recharges you
same thing over the longer term multiple
weeks multiple months
eventually fatigue accumulates and you
have to bring it down
somehow now that's somehow interesting
because we could just be like why not
just take time off
which brings us to point two of why we
deload instead of just taking time off
because bringing things down a ton could
mean taking him off and we'll see later
that is a viable option
but maybe not the most viable in all
cases because of point number two
we want to try to conserve the
adaptations that we've gained
over the last x y z number of weeks of
our mesocycle
so that we're not losing either anything
or not losing at all
right all that strength you built all
that technical proficiency you built
lifting
you know being in the groove all that
muscle you built when you take
time off we'll talk about how much time
off is too much in just a little bit
but when you take time off completely
some of that hangs in there for a while
some of it starts to recede if ideally
it could recede
the smallest bit possible or not recede
at all we get the benefit of both worlds
huge drop in fatigue to let us restart a
new productive mezzo
and no losses in fitness or minimal
losses so we can start and go and go and
go
and have the most productive back to
back-to-back training cycles and
eventually get bigger and stronger than
everyone and find that that's a very
lonely place at the top
so here's the thing
okay deloading has to be done here is
the core concept
okay of how it has to be done we already
know why to bring down fatigue and to
maintain adaptations but here's the core
concept of how
deloading must be very
easy compared to your normal training
okay here's the thing if you're still
training hard
in a theoretical sense what is above
your minimum effective dose of training
be that intensity
volume whatever if you're still training
hard you are making adaptations
hypothetically otherwise why the hell
are you training hard
if you could make adaptations and bring
down fatigue at the same time
why the hell would you ever train in any
other mode
if i told you there was a way in which
your fatigue would not accumulate and
would actually reduce
while you made gains you'd be like what
is it is there a genie involved
is there a bottle from which the genie
emerges with three wishes and i already
wished for
infinite recoverable volume this is
crazy and it just isn't true
as long as training is hard enough to
make you better
as long as training is hard it does not
allow fatigue to meaningfully reduce
from a very high point which means
that in order to get the most out of
your deload
training has to be below the level of
which
causes gains not so far that it causes
mega losses we'll talk about in a bit
but that level has to be low right
in any way you choose to slice it and
i'm gonna quote
uh dr andrew fry i could say colleague
of mine but more like a mentor
uh top top strength uh sports scientist
from uh
kansas he said literally to me
and other folks in a presentation i
heard live about deloading generally
when you hit the brakes hit them hard
okay huge huge revelation
so whatever we're going to find out
about deloading more specifically in the
next couple of minutes
we're always going to keep that in the
back of our heads anything we call
de-learning has to be a really really
really big break
from our normal training that is your
d-load when you show up and do it should
kind of be like
meh well i guess we're in here doing
this if anyone's ever impressed by your
d-load like whoa you really
killed that deload you're probably doing
it wrong it's
much much easier is the thing next
question
and we're not going to cover this in
depth this time there's other lectures
we're going to be making later that
cover this in much more depth like
mesocycle design and so on and so forth
is how often should you deload deload
remember there's other
ways to recover that are shorter there's
technique or light sessions there's half
weeks
there's active rest phases which are
longer delaying is one week in duration
how often do we need to deload in that
case well
the usual the just more basic grand
concept
is when you're too fatigued to improve
or even maintain your strength
probably when you're too fatigued to
improve your strength is probably a time
when deloading is a really really good
idea if you do not deload
once your strength is no longer going up
in any measurable capacity reps
load anything and you're just flatlining
and or you're getting ready to actually
reduce inabilities someone could ask you
listen what are you getting out of this
training even though you're not uh
making any strides forward you could be
like
uh just training you know
like so if you deloaded the fatigue
would clear and you would start to make
gains again you'd be like yeah
like so why aren't you doing that now
like i don't know right so when you're
no longer making gains when the fatigue
is accumulated so much that it's erased
your ability to make gains
then it's probably time to deload now
how do we know it's not just an off
session okay so like
last week on thursday or last week
monday
you squatted you know 300 for a couple
sets of 10 okay and that was a pr
this time you squat 305 but you get like
sets of eight and seven and six like but
you're trying like zero rir
you can't do any more could it be
that you're not at like your maximum
ability your maximum recoverable volume
could it be that you could do more and
still progress
maybe maybe one session it could just be
a bad session you know your
boyfriend broke up with you the session
before and you're like no
but i still gotta go squat and you suck
maybe
right so we want a two session
confirmation that's our rule
the way we judge when performance is no
longer increasing or decreases
is if it does that no longer increasing
or decreasing for two sessions in a row
it doesn't have to be two weeks in a row
just sessions
so if that monday your squats went to
hell let's say thursday you do leg
presses
last week you did whatever number this
week your performance is less
monday and thursday probably not chance
right
it's probably time to do delude and
somebody could say listen it's not
because i've accumulated so much volume
and so much fatigue over this whole meso
i've just had a super duper stressful
last week
and that's why i've underperformed well
check this out stress is cumulative
and it accumulates from multiple
components
so psychological stress can actually
accumulate into the same sort of general
stress
box that you have in your body for all
stress including training stress
and diet stress and all that other stuff
so if you say well look the only reason
i have high stress is because of
psychological reasons
you still have the same amount of high
stress and a deload
coming of course hopefully with stable
or psychological times
can way reduce that and give you a clean
slate so it doesn't so much matter it
matters in some specific cases
it doesn't so much matter where the
fatigue came from if you underperform
two sessions in a row and you don't have
a very good reason
for it that's just going to get
rectified right after deloading is a
real good idea
and especially if you're in a mesocycle
and you know close to what your maximum
recoverable volume is let's say you've
never really done
any more than 20 sets of biceps in a
week and be able to steadily keep up
your performance
it's just too much to recover from like
if you're at
19 sets of biceps last week and then
this week your performance stress
defaulter
look it doesn't require a mystery
detective to figure out what the hell is
going on
you're probably pushing it and it's
probably time to back off no big deal
so once we have decided to pull
the plug pull the trigger on deloading
how do we do it
okay i'm going to give you guys three
options
for hypertrophy dealers this is if
you're training in a program
where hypertrophy is the number one goal
we're also going to give you some
strength delaying tips in a bit
and if you ask well if my program is
dedicated to both you can do somewhere
half in between these okay
number one way to do it these are not
ranked in order they're just options
number one way is splitting the deload
in all these cases into half weeks
first half of the deal a week second
half of the deal of me in the first half
of the deal a week in way number one
you drop your volume and you ease up
on reps in reserve get much further away
from failure
in the first half of the week and you
also drop your load on the bar a ton in
the second half so for example
let's say you do six sets of around 10
reps 300 pounds
last week okay and let's say for both
beginning of the week and end of the
week
easy example to just use both at the
same time in the first half of the week
you're gonna do three sets half the sets
okay
five reps half the reps huge cut
remember
when you're gonna if you're gonna uh
push on the brakes push on the brakes
hard right
half the sets half the reps but you keep
300 pounds
right why because heavy loading tends to
conserve muscle mass much better
right so cool we've conserved all
fitness no big deal
and then you really need to bring all
sources of fatigue down including joint
and connective tissue fatigue in a big
way in the second half
so in the second half you do again three
sets again five reps way down anyway
but now it's half the weight 150 pounds
geez that's super easy by the end of
that week
psychologically you'll be like violent
and ready to go and do another killer
week
right so this accomplishes really good
things that lets you get some heavy
loading in if you prefer that if your
body can tolerate it so on and so forth
and it probably maintains a bit more
fitness characteristics
there's not that when you start training
heavy next week there's not that as big
of a shock of like oh holy crap
i haven't done anything heavy in a week
this feels weird it won't feel weird but
if your joints and connective tissue can
take it this is a really really good way
to go
there is an alternative way way number
two okay just
two hypothetical ways neither one is
better or worse you can drop your load
and rer on the first half of the week
and your volumes as well in the second
half so for example same same example
six sets of ten ish reps at 300 pounds
in uh the last week of accumulation
right week five or whatever before you
deload
in the first half of the deload week
you do six sets still
of 10-ish reps there's plenty of volume
but at
pounds half the weight so these six sets
a day you look at six sets of ten and
you're like
crap that's a fucking d load that sounds
like a workout but then you look at 150
pounds you're like
oh like i'm sure a lot of you watching
are squatting like something like
300 you know for sets of 10. like
imagine how hard is it really to squat
150 for a set of 10. like it's
kind of a warm-up it's literally warm up
so you basically do six warmups in a row
it gets you a little pump it gets you a
little blood flow nothing to write home
about barely anything
but you get to feel your swag a little
bit and because it's
kind of plenty of volume it'll conserve
some adaptations as well more volume
than the other condition less load than
the other condition
and then in the second half of the week
it's almost the same as the second half
last time
still three sets of 10 but not 150
pounds all right
so huge is super super easy right so we
just cut the volume
right just fewer of the sets the
advantage to this method is this
it doesn't do as good of a job keeping
you as psychologically and
neurologically strong because it doesn't
expose you to the heavy loads
but it lets your joints and connective
tissues heal more
because even though the volume is a
little higher the load is so low it's
not going to bother your joints hardly
at all unless you're really really
broken that's why the first method is
probably better for beginner
intermediate
or early intermediate lifters the second
method is something you want to
transition into
as you get really really big and really
really strong because for example
if you're let's say bent rowing 300
pounds
you know at d-load which has you do 300
pounds but for a sets of five
instead of sets of 10 is still 300
pounds in your hands on your elbows in
your shoulders
through your lower back good god it is
technically a deload but to your joints
and connective tissues it sometimes
isn't
it sure as hell doesn't feel like one
and sometimes folks that are very
advanced by the end of their
accumulation they're so beat up like in
the literal sense they have so many
micro tears in their joints connective
tissues
that even getting under the bar for like
the same squat weight you normally do
like you got some of these the super
strong guys in bodybuilder are squatting
like 550
for higher reps look 550 at all on your
back for almost anyone is just a lot of
weight and you just might not want to do
that it might not be a good idea for
joints and connective tissues ideally
would it be better theoretically if you
could handle it yes but
we got to do what we have to do what we
can do not what we ideally could do
so if you start to do these normal
dealer weeks like point number one
or process number one here and you're
finding that as you get stronger like
the d-load works that bring down general
fatigue but you're like
man my elbows are not healing like
because i'm benching heavy
still in that d-load week and ooh if the
elbows are just not having it
try to go a little bit on the lighter
side keep the volume a little moderate
and you might find that that works
better for you
lastly point number three you could just
not train at all
that's totally an option it's fine
it's probably not optimal optimal
because there's some muscle retention
and some technical retention you can get
and there's also some data that very
easy workouts bring down fatigue
itself faster than no workouts at all
but that's technical fatigue at a sort
of measured perspective sometimes
just the psychology of the situation is
that you just don't want to be in the
gym
and sometimes it's cool to take a week
off uh that's totally fine okay so don't
feel like you have to deload you can
just take a week off and just start
again no big deal
if you want to do what's best best
deload which one of these do you choose
either one of them or anything in
between we'll cover this at the end but
as long as it's super easy compared to
regular training as this clearly is
you're off to a real good start next
deloading for strength a little bit
different because
load and technique matter for strength
more than they do for hypertrophy so
option number one for strength is you
drop your load by ten percent
why are we dropping load by ten percent
uh there's no condition here by the way
in which
keeps the load for strength it's got to
be a drop because strength is strength
training is
so high intensity so high load we got to
drop it a little bit
you're not gonna be rehitting your pr
you hit last week you're going to want
maybe 10
lower 10 low drop and volume drop 50
in the first week and then both drop to
50 of normal
in the second half of the deal a week so
for example you do six sets of five ish
at 400 pounds
whatever on the squad or deadlift in the
last week
first workout or early in the week
workout would be
still three sets of five at 360 pounds
now notice
that's pretty tough okay that is no joke
right and as you get stronger and
stronger you may not want to do that
sort of thing but if you're a beginner
intermediate that's totally fine it does
actually you know six sets of five
four hundred that'll beat you to death
three sets of five at 360.
yeah you know it's nothing to write home
about uh it'll probably feel like when
you leave you're like oh that was
that was okay that wasn't too bad and
then you a lot of fatigue will drop
because it's literally having the volume
and 10 percent down by the way
and then the second half of that week
still three sets
still five reps but at 200 pounds half
of 400 i mean that's just gonna feel
super super easy and for sure gonna drop
all the rest of your fatigue
option number two is kind of more of
that
similar to option number two in the
hypertrophy example you drop your load
and volume by 50
the entire time okay so six
uh six sets of five for 400 pounds in
the last week
super mega workout the best you can do
and then three sets half the sets five
ish reps still the same rep reps he's
not gonna cut a whole lot of reps you're
doing five that's low anyway
at 200 pounds though the entire both
halves
okay why is this method better same
reason
because it lets your joints and
connective tissues heal for bigger and
stronger lifters look sometimes after
you've benched
400 or squatted 500 or deadlifted 600
for reps
in that last week of super psycho
volumes and intensities and everything
rpe 10 type of shit
you're just not putting that amount of
weight on the bar anymore and nothing
close like if you're really really
messed up from 400 pound benches
360 is not easy okay if you've been
doing 400 pound deadlifts and you have
to deadlift 360 and you're more of an
intermediate that might be like super
doable
right so a lot of this is really depends
on how close to the limit of
adaptation a lifter is and how
objectively high these numbers are
right and just like with a hypertrophy
example
anything in between is totally fine and
even some stuff outside the bounds is
fine now here's the thing
unlike with hypertrophy training taking
a week off completely from strength
training is
less of a good idea relatively speaking
why
because taking time off completely from
strength training
can degrade your technique meaningfully
technique is more
important the specific groove you're
taking your sort of athleticism
enable being able to execute very very
fine technique is more important to
strength training because it's a skill
versus hypertrophy training where you
just blast muscles and you're good to go
as long as your technique is fine
right so you don't want to lose that
mojo and you might lose it a little bit
if you take a whole week off you feel
real rusty coming back and that's a very
very common thing not everyone feels
like that so for folks that don't a week
off is fine
but give it some thought if you're in
strength training it's probably better
to do a much lighter week much easier
week of deloading
and make it very light and easy even
lighter and easier than option number
two
is probably better by a considerable
degree
than taking a week off altogether
because then you come back
and you're not beat up at all because
the weights were super light in the
volume strip alone but you
did practice the techniques and
especially practicing techniques when
they're light and super easy
really can you can expand your technical
groove and make it even better
so then when you enter week one of the
next plan because remember the point
isn't just to drop the fatigue as a drop
of fatigue and drop minimum adaptations
when you enter week one of your next
plan not only is the fatigue gone
but you're feeling real crisp on the
lifts versus finishing off the fatigue
with a complete week off
coming into the first week you're like
what the hell is lifting what the hell
is a barbell right and sometimes it can
feel really awkward even after a week
especially for folks that are training
strength and power sports like
weightlifting
very unusual for weightlifting deloads
to take an entire week off
strength training deloads power lifting
strong man a little bit more common
still very uncommon
bodybuilding ton of people instead of
dealing take weeks off and it's totally
fine so that's how that kind of stacks
up
here's the deal closing remarks on this
to wrap it all up
everything i gave are just examples and
they
work but they don't work ideally for
everyone so
feel free to just take inspiration from
them you could do them verbatim no
problem
but if you just take inspiration from
them and modify them to how it works
best for you
then that's absolutely totally cool
right just remember
that deloading has to be much easier
than regular training
and especially towards the last half of
the deal of a week you should feel your
fatigue going away
you should feel fresher sharper your
desire to train should be more elevated
right
by the friday of deloading you should be
like swear to god if someone doesn't put
a barbell in front of me i'm going to
kill
right that's how you want to feel if by
friday your daily week was so hard that
you're like man
crap i got a new meso starting monday
like you're in a bad place because
remember you have to buy yourself enough
fatigue clearance time
to do another four to eight weeks of
accumulation holy crap
you better be feeling 100 by the end of
that deload if it's anything less you're
doing too much
and here's the last thing if
you have a deload session and you leave
that session with
big pump okay or having hit pr's like
i've literally seen people post videos
like
did a deload hit a pr like what in the
name of god
about deloading knows pr is nothing it's
the opposite of pr's
if you're doing that you're not
deloading doesn't matter what you say in
your notebook
and you're going to pay for it in the
next mesocycle the worst way to pay
of course is injury but highly unlikely
the second worst but nonetheless
really annoying way to pay is you sort
of deload go too heavy go too hard do
too much volume
and you're pretty much fine because you
drop some fatigue not enough
in that next several weeks let's say you
planned a six-week accumulation
and this is real nasty i've had this
happen to me a bunch of clients and
everyone
week two one week one you feel great
week two you feel okay
week three the fatigue catches up to you
because it's exponential and you feel
awful and someone's like week four right
and you're like nope
and then you gotta take a d load in the
middle of your mesocycle and look if you
have a show planned
or planned vacation where you wanna look
ripped or you plan your mass mesocycles
together
you're throwing off the plan and that
sucks right it sucks
it's great to know i'm going to hit my
peak and i'm going to back off and i'm
going to hit all those pr's it's going
to be great
it sucks to hit the similar number of
objective prs
but have one week in the middle of your
mezzo where you fall apart you didn't
know it was coming
right don't do that plan to deload
detect when you need to deal with it on
performance and when you deload
cut back big come back stronger and
you'll be doing a real good job
getting the strength you need getting
the aperture if you need over the long
term and that's where it counts
now you might be asking yourself a
question after this video okay i'm done
deloading
i had this great productive metal cycle
of hypertrophy training for example
how do i construct my next mesocycle do
i just start the weights that i did in
last week
do i start some lighter weights what do
i do with volumes folks guess what the
next video we're gonna post in the
series
answers all of those questions and i'll
see you then
you
