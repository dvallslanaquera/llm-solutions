two when you're done you're doing a
great job today
slow and controlled begin slow slow
gentle
yes and up fast one more go right away
slow slow slow slow gentle
[Music]
folks i got an interesting story for you
charlie jung and i were just walking
around uh
los angeles it was a fi it was a stroll
evening stroll and we happened upon
barbara brigade where
eugene
teo
was walking around ripping
doors off hinges punching people in the
face
and he kept yelling bring me
an asian challenger with whom to do a
leg hypertrophy workouts evidence-based
he said all these things people were
scattering all around running to the
hills helicopters crashing the hollywood
sign broken in half luckily charlie
young
powered up to his level
and then and then eugene was like
but then he was like god he also powered
up to his shit and now there's gonna be
a fucking clash and also i'm training
eugene it's a pleasure and honor to have
you on our channel how are you feeling
thank you i am i am quietly terrified
that was a very true story and now i'm
all true i'm on the come down past the
whole whole thing
back to bruce banner i'm like okay now
i've got to try to back it up somehow
all my muscles off my bones yes you have
a few options you can think your way
through the shit because bruce banner
smart or you could gray hulk the shit
where he's got both
right or whatever maybe you're not been
in the comics or i just sit at home and
masturbate alone by myself too much
didn't that thank you so much yes i was
there literally minutes ago and there's
semen on my shoulder
your boy shoot them all over anyway
folks let's get to leg training let's
get it done charlie how are you feeling
pretty good how does it feel to be at
barbell grade where you are king
feel like uh goku throwing the spirit
bomb yes you're gonna draw power from
all the other asians that's what's up
will you guys both be doing that what
the fuck am i supposed to do luckily
hollywood's just down the street baby
fellaini jews down there for me to fight
the jews are stingy so i'm like i don't
know about the power level hey are we
gonna get canceled an hour later let's
find out legs
[Music]
yeah we're going to do a couple sets of
everything buy a total of like seven or
eight cents for the whole workout all
right if you feel rhabdo e just tell us
your fucking that's it you know what i
mean yeah like one good hard set out of
everything would be ideal okay uh and
anything about that is bonus for us so
don't do anything stupid get yourself
killed you know what i mean
you have you haven't been doing super
hardcore in a while no no so you know
how that works like you go over you'll
have to
that's a good youtube video though oh
sure i'm happy to do it for the views
great great great
and gnarly
that's really good
i mean his hair by the way yeah yeah
yeah it could be okay if we exchange
some pews every now and again yeah
sure coach me i'm here all right i'm
here to be coached very cool get my head
between my legs that's it that's the
goal if you can do wrap all the way
around to see your back that's amazing
that's what the real good morning is
that's when you're gonna have a good
morning
three exercises today we're gonna try to
get in there's plenty of people in the
gym today the plan is
uh safety good morning comfortable way
to grab the handles nothing magical
about it
a couple sets of five to 10 reps
then we're going to do leg press couple
sets my rep style 10 to 20 15 to 20 reps
and then we're gonna come back and do
probably safety bar squats high bar
probably with a pause super ultra deep
super full round side well of course
that'll be the leg workout we all train
cabs on different days anyway
we'll see how long mr eugene lasts
[Music]
just up mike
oh
[Music]
[Music]
smooth transition out of the bottom
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
should i try to arch as much as i can
like even this extend extended
sure
and there's not
any risk of hyper extension that's
realistic yeah because as you apply load
your ability to extend is counteracted
by the weight so at worst you end up a
little bit more extended than neutral
right and then that's totally safe
position yeah no if i was trying to lift
the most weight in the good morning i
would take a completely neutral spine
and bear down okay that's not the point
the point is to get the hamstrings
involved as much as possible all right
and this uh anterior pelvic tilt
actually probably reduces
neural signaling to your glutes
but we're not training glutes for
training hamstrings right and the
trade-off is worth it to put them into
that interior pelvic tilt the
pre-stretch is killer another thing you
want to consider
is as you do this and start to descend
your knees are going to want to do this
don't let them keep them almost
completely straight yeah
all right even if that means
compromising depth we're going to care
about depth don't care about the depth
we care about painful stretching your
hamstrings all right all right
we can count this as a work set if it
feels good enough all right big chest
spot back
fuck back
fuck back
good yes again
backing up
butt up
butt up
butt up
oh yeah
couple more now your knees knees back a
little bit butt up knees back knees back
knees back knees back knees back yeah
good
butt up he's back he's back don't let
him drift
yeah there you go two more eugene let's
go fuck back knees back two keep those
knees
straight yeah that's better now keep
them straighter on the way down
straighter knees right there beautiful
keep those knees knees knees knees knees
up
yeah sucks yeah right yeah you feel it
in your hands and everything really yeah
i feel it all the way up now it's always
more like just at the bottom like
towards the insertion yeah
the entire range of motion you feel
brilliant
[Music]
oh
keep those knees straighter
hips high hips high
there you go don't bend the knees
don't bend the knees almost straight
knees
[Music]
push your knees back
yes
now we're fucking rolling
even at the bottom couple more keep
those knees back put the tension on the
hams
yes one more deep big chest
knees back knees back knees back there
you go
good shit
[Music]
yep
[Music]
one more
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now you're trying to put your hips at
the top of the ceiling behind you
there you go oh yes yes yes yes that's
perfect right there two more
knees
big chest knees back
[Music]
good
[Music]
i feel them shaking because it's like
what is this yeah this is a new a new
position that's it do you want to start
heading over to the leg press to sort it
out
[Applause]
[Music]
these are cool
they're awesome
so like they're made by versa groups no
i thought right the same name yeah it's
its own company's called versalift
and i came across them
and now i just paint them because i love
them i love it because i like they're
like what do you want like nothing i
love your fucking product i love it
because you can't see it yeah i've got
it i've got great range you know i'm
just tall that's how i am all right
folks good mornings are done
like press time
blood pressure armor it's very good not
perfect
the range of motion is a little limited
at the side there
so
we're going to do multiple steps i'm
probably going to do four sets of length
classes probably maybe two or three gg
may be doing two or three we'll see how
he handles it a lot of form technique
corrections and queues
so that's a 10 to 20 let's get it
done
every time you hit bottom pause for a
split second at the bottom
[Music]
good
is that all the way down
touch the bottom of the machine
yes
three
[Music]
oh 13 keep going
control
[Music]
14.
[Music]
three let's go the goal is 20 you're at
15.
oh yep one more no no no no no slow
control up
rest breathe
two when you're done right away
slow
back up that's it one more go go go slow
slow and up
[Music]
that was nice that was nice nice
good stuff man technique was great
execution was great it was nice and slow
i love it
locking your knees out when your leg
pressed both you and charlie have
what would be considered by the public
guy a more aggressive lockout at the top
is that an issue or when does it become
an issue it is
it becomes an issue
if you're handling more load
with your legs
than your legs are able to lift and
control
so people who unrack the leg press by
pressing down their hands yeah they're
by definition lifting a load they can't
lift with their legs
putting the whole system in jeopardy
it's like taking your car
putting a rocket on it
okay
but the engine's not in control then
that would be bad
another is if you're incredibly rare
hyper laxity condition of the joints
right
and and can confidently don't know what
you're doing
and
that's probably about it
people unrack
and lock with squats all the time yeah
nobody bats an eye
and at any time people say
i've seen a ton of videos of people
getting hurt yeah
they're
lying by
uh
implicit interpolation
so they've seen three videos
and they and they interpolate and say
there must be more but there aren't all
right but there's just aren't that many
people getting hurt doing this yeah
there's like one arabic dude
the one white lady and the one indian
dude it wasn't even like pressing
a piece of equipment he was like
pursuing a car
and it like was not trained
i'm sure there are a few other videos
but
hundreds of millions of people work out
and there's videos of car accidents but
we still get into cars
locking out a leg press to charlie and i
would be like going
100 kilometers an hour on a freeway
it's not without its risks
but it's worth the trade-offs of us
getting a total complete range of motion
right we get to rest and reach that a
little bit at the top
and for us
the cognitive bandwidth of trying to
slow down at the top
is wasted effort yeah since the marginal
risk
of a massive injury is incredibly small
yeah for sure so for sure i've never
seen it have you ever seen it no just
those literally those those are
literally three minutes
maybe probably have some other one as
well yeah yeah that's a tick tock effect
that's a social media effect 100 percent
you're freaking out you've got there
around it i'm saying
by the way
if you comment on this video
and you're like
i don't know man that whips me out
you're a bitch you're bitch made i'm
serious the cold man that wigs me out
that freaks me out like what are you
bragging about pussy
like shit is hard out here you feel me
like no i'm like
you're losing fucking tension so you're
a little bitch by resting like that
that's what the real issue is fuck
that's true yeah how dare you take that
split second law
that was zero reps the muscles are like
we're gonna grow and the suicide goes
away that cancel that signal
cancel and decay goes up everything
sounds great gentle touch three
[Music]
slow descent
[Music]
[Music]
two more finish off strong
flow
gentle good last one gentle touch slow
don't you rush this rep slow gentle
touch
good job
good shit
[Music]
that was great yeah for you yeah it's
easy for me to just yell at you
uh
do you want to do one more after this
are you doing one more oh yeah well i'm
doing a bunch more but all right
peer pressure
and this is how i pull my quad
[Music]
i don't know how you normally judge your
rest periods but this is a pretty long
rest because we're working together and
talking a bit
with that kind of length would you
expect me to be able to get the same
kind of quality same kind of performance
of reps
i didn't i didn't hit true failure there
like i was very close but
i can't say it's going to be the same
yeah but i can see the probability of it
being more similar it's higher yeah than
if we rested left right yeah and would
you prefer to accumulate fatigue with
shorter rest or would you rather
take as long as i need to if you've got
to make sure i'm getting under that
stimulus so
i think the correct answer is
you want to make sure your local
musculature
is a limiting factor
not your cardiovascular ability
not your software drive
and not other muscles so for example
i do another set when
i'm not breathing hard
when i feel strong
you're like right after this that you
feel defeated
and when my lower back isn't so burning
that it's prevented me from doing
another heart attack
then i know in my neck that my quads
will be limiting
that may occur after two minutes if i
rest four minutes
it's still good i'll just get more reps
what i don't want to do is rest one
minute
and fail myself
get way few reps
because i was just like yes
we're not here to train our lives
yeah
so i mean assuming all else is equal
um would it matter if i took so i took
four minutes i feel good to go
if i took an extra two minutes or six
minutes total i'd definitely probably
get a few more reps out is that is that
beneficial at all no it wouldn't help
but you can make up for it by just doing
more stuff right right so you're just
like saying you're good to go just go
don't rest any longer when you're ready
to go
and your muscle is gonna be limiting
factor feel free to go anytime yeah that
doesn't mean you can't wait yeah yeah
there's no uh there's no good reason for
it right right
control
two one more slow
slow
touch up breathe
two when you're done you're doing a
great job today
slow and controlled begin slow slow
gentle
yes and up fast one more go right away
slow slow slow slow gentle
wrap amazing amazing amazing amazing
you're good
oh brilliant
how old are
21 you'll you
know 15. you'll never know it's a
devil's sacred 11 years old you go yeah
watch it anyway a very deep voiced 11
year old
all right still a trend
all the trend pgto comes out is not
daddy
all right everybody's mad at here
everybody's fucking daddy on this camera
right now
we never use that shit
last night i like press
i figured fuck it let's do a drop set
because these guys are done like
pressing and i have like three more sets
so fuck that
so
we're gonna do drop set
six plates
five plates
four plates
three plates
[Music]
[Music]
here we go
[Music]
you got it
yes
[Music]
yes
[Music]
paused
[Music]
yes
[Laughter]
i feel better now i feel better oh yeah
[Music]
oh yeah
rat rack back rack rack
[Music]
that's great that feels horrible work
set all right so about 10.
we'll see yeah good technique five to
ten charlie side spots here
we got you i love it thank you thank you
yes
remember
as you descend
so that your knees track forward while
your heels stay down
big upright chest the whole time and on
the way up push first with your chest
all right totally counterintuitive yeah
bad idea if you want to be as strong as
possible incredible idea for quad high
purchasing
six little paws at the bottom
that's high
[Music]
chest
yes
one more
slow
up
rest for a second breathe and one last
one upright good technique tight okay
the whole time you're in the hole stop
deep
up oh straight wrap
[Music]
you look much better on that last rep
yeah how about a little mini breath yeah
i think it's gonna like the um
eight and nine i started to shift a bit
yeah yeah
just eight
don't worry about the count okay
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
keep going
[Music]

control control yes
up
rest breathe
one
whatever you're ready
[Music]
just stop
up
up
breathe
one and done
just stop
stand up pop up up
wow 20 reps it's tough that was
unbelievable dude
thanks for having my back though i
really appreciate it of course man
really appreciate you guys tuning in
and we'll see you guys next time
[Music]
hey folks dr mike here from renaissance
periodization
i um
was wandering around i took a long
longer walk than usual to clear my head
walked over to melbourne australia and
grabbed eugene tto and thought let's get
him on the channel ask him some
questions
so we're actually at uh barbell brigade
the
spirit home of all asian lifters that's
a really long walk from melbourne and
back to the barbell brigade but we did
it we did it together and that's what's
important friendship exactly um
so
i actually wanted to ask eugene about
how
your family and friends
responded to your increased fascination
with and dedication to and
life commitment to lifting
because
i come from a russian jewish background
and when you're a russian jew the
acceptable professions are professor of
science
lawyer doctor
business person that makes a lot of
money
or engineer of some sort and that's
really just it and if you start
dedicating yourself to muscle building
people around you get very confused and
start to speculate that you're veering
off
um
you are
asian clearly
i think so
i haven't had a testing done just yet
there's no 23andme
uh tell us a little bit about maybe some
of your ancestry culture and
uh family friend situation growing up
and if you ever hit any i'm not
necessarily speed bumps but was there
any uh at any point when someone in your
family or friends was like
this is what you're really doing with
your life you know what i mean yeah for
sure i mean it's it's a very similar
story to what you say culturally where
so i'm malaysian but i was born in
australia and i did grow up in a very
australian ethnic community
although you can't take my parents who
are malaysian born take their
biases from their upbringing out of them
so it's very typical where like
our role is to become doctors lawyers
dentists my sister my brother and their
doctor and they're both doctors my
sister's a doctor my brother is a
dentist and i was meant to do law um and
then i wound up in business i was like a
drop out thing what do you mean meant to
do laughs
like that was the thing you're gonna do
you're like i got into law school like
you're going to go do it i was like
maybe not maybe i'll just do business
instead as a cop out i did business yes
is that because so real quick is that
because you
liked law no no
so when you were meant to do laws is
because you were good at that kind of
stuff or did your parents ever straight
up tell you like hey you should be
go be a lawyer right so i mean and you
can probably um probably relate to this
a lot as well is um
the reason why we have these
um it's not stigma but these cultural
beliefs around what we should be is when
we're growing up is because parents want
stability for you of course all you ever
want success and stability they want
they want they want what's best for
their children like they're not pushing
on you for their own agenda they want to
actually be you which um is is very much
rooted into the asian culture and also
the jewish culture they want you to be
successful not for their benefit per se
um for jews it's absolutely for their
benefit actually totally yeah
i did date a jewish group of one that
wasn't very much for the parents
not
[Laughter]
so
for me yeah i did business and i was
studying actually i started doing as an
asian you're allowed to do business if
you're doing accounting and finance yeah
that's serious yeah that was my that was
what i was doing and then i um i failed
that and i was like okay this is not
working out for me what do you mean by
field like i literally failed all the
subjects for accounting and finance yes
in my first year through uni so you seem
really sharp i suspect you just didn't
give enough of a shit to trust yes
exactly right because yeah fresh out of
high school so um yeah fresh out of high
school i went i started going to
business school and
i just started to
realize that university is very
different to schooling like high school
or whatever high school is very rigid
very structured and i'm very good at
that
like part of the asian upbringing you do
this yeah it's like do this classically
trained like as a musician classically
trained we're just like here's the thing
do it over and over and over again the
reason why i did so well in school like
in high school was because of all wrote
learning like it's all about here's a
textbook write down these notes
put it to your memory and spit it back
out on a paper in the exam great at that
i'll just study and just nerd out and do
that but in university it's like well
hang on just do whatever you want you're
just like
you you live your life you suffer the
consequences sure come to class don't
come to class
i was not prepared for that whatsoever
because i needed that structure because
that's my upbringing
so that's a big reason why i failed and
a lot of what i did i was like this is
just
not working for me and at the same time
is when i finished high school the
second i finished high school i started
personal training i started working in
the gym and that was my thing because
you were already lifting weights yeah
already lifting weights since i was
about 13 14 going to the high school gym
um and
so my mom would drop me off at the gym
at 5am or whatever she's like oh it's
for sport you know it's part of this
high schooling thing
and i was itching i was like enjoying it
a lot was really obsessed with it and
when i started doing personal training
she's like okay this is a cool like this
is a good um
part-time job for him this is this is a
side hustle while he's going through uni
of course and then when he gets out of
uni he'll be qualified he'll be
you'll be working in an investment bank
he'll be some economist or some finance
somebody we can tell family friends
about in a dinner party conversation and
they can have that like fake pride like
all eugene's doing so well exactly peak
asian and jewish achievement for parents
exactly so for me when i was doing all
the personal training they just didn't
see it as a serious thing so yeah you're
good it's better than you working at
subway which i was doing before that
sure my only other job has been you know
selling sandwiches and sandwich artists
i bet you were pretty fucking good
all the extra ingredients
if i was your manager i'd be like cut
that shit out oh yeah yeah are you
losing all the margins here
this is fun
i didn't i never took it seriously it
was just like most things when i take
them seriously
you were like fine the artist part you
really went in
yes my creative juices can flow with all
the meatballs and the chicken fillets
extra cheese what's that you want cheese
i'll give you cheese
i like jalapenos extra jalapeno to see
what happens so that's the beauty of it
um but yeah like they really didn't
understand it they didn't accept it most
of my friends like when i was in uni the
first couple of months of uni i dove
into head first into whole party
lifestyle in high school
i wasn't very close to friends if i was
someone who was kind of insecure so i'd
go along to these parties and i was
um did you have fun with them yeah but
it was more so i was trying to fit in i
was trying to be acceptable
i'm going to do all these things because
i just want to fit in and be cool um
and yeah in hot in
in um
in university your first few months i
was diving into that as well
parties getting more fun at university
yeah
at the same time though i started taking
bodybuilding and training even more
seriously i got my first coach around
that time as well when like 17 18 and
that's when i realized okay like these
two wells don't mesh i started like
alienating myself specifically from all
of my social group of friends um where
i'd be skipping uni to eat i'd be
skipping uni parties to obviously sleep
and train or whatever because like you
can't be hung over deadlifting the next
day like a trainer i tried that too and
i've realized these two things don't mix
don't mix i just stopped doing that yeah
um and then that was the point where i
was like yeah you know what i want to be
focusing on bodybuilding i can't be
eating out i can't be going my family
can't be enjoying family events my coach
he didn't tell me not to do those things
but he didn't tell me to do those things
so in my mind it was wrong to have a
cheat meal i call it the default asian
assumption on how to do sports yeah look
i'm gonna be good at this i'm gonna i
laser the fuck out of it and do
everything exactly over perfectly where
i never cheat or never do anything
exactly i mean it was high school i was
wrote learn from all over and say i'm
gonna do this this is my my machinistic
kind of way of doing it and i'll get
success and my personal understanding
they're like why aren't you eating why
aren't you eating out with us why aren't
you while you're at christmas bringing
out your weighing scales to weigh out
the turkey and the sweet potato and even
then you're stressing out because it's
not your typical chicken breasts yes i
would freak me out because it was on my
meal plan oh yeah um
they understand and then i got i bulked
up a lot and it was like a fat bulk i
had no idea what i was doing again
just listen to my coach's orders he got
me really fat up about 40 50 pounds i
had to drop a pure body fat for my first
show um i'll i'll give you guys photos
you can put it up here it'll be like
nice little tubby eugene um damn yeah it
was fun it was adorable yeah
puffy cheeks was very light-skinned yeah
it's cute it was cute um but yeah they
didn't understand what's going on and it
wasn't until i did my first show where i
actually got lean my mom and dad were
like ah okay this this is why you did
the last few years of delayed
gratification and getting yourself fat
or whatever which is not what you have
to do but they in their mind they now
saw the end product and they understood
the process leading up to it and they
started to accept it a little bit more
and then it was
still they are still in uni at the times
i still saw they still saw uni as being
my thing and it wasn't
and that but it started to accept it
more and then it wasn't until maybe a
few years later i started working more
in the gym and they saw me taking a lot
more of my own initiative and pushing my
business and growing my business more
and taking on more clients and then
eventually getting to the point where
like i was um running events and
everything did you stop doing uni
altogether no i did i did i didn't
finish yeah p's get degrees with a
a business yeah degree yeah so a
bachelor's in um marketing and
management excellent yeah yeah so i've
got two did you use anything from school
in your future career um
formerly no but i'm absolutely certain
subconsciously i've got that mentality
in my head of like ah marketing
management all these kinds of business
skills yeah you're probably not doing a
lot of dumb stuff that you would do by
trial and error just simply by like
implies and understanding of course you
would do this but you don't remember
where you got it from yeah exactly
exactly so that yeah that's very much
how i looked at it and then yeah it
wasn't until maybe the last last five
six years or so when i started like
becoming more of a presence in the
industry people and my parents could see
how i was
making good money and i was helping a
lot of people and being asked like
travel around the world to do a lot of
things they're like
they're like okay
yeah you're not a doctor yeah you're not
a lawyer yeah you're not whatever but
you're
financially secure
that was a bit mum would always say is
like yeah huge i'm really happy now
because you can take care of yourself
sure you're financially secure and that
is important for sure and that's all
that's all i ever wanted for me and so
my yeah both my parents every one of us
wanted to make sure that i was set up
and i was comfortable to be able to do
my own thing so when they my mom could
see me doing that she was like oh okay
like there wasn't like a one day which
is just black and white change but it
was more so a car can accept this
and nowadays they're pretty supportive
yeah yeah that now you know mom is my
biggest fan like she comes i train her
once a week at least at the gym and we
just wow yeah it's great it's really
cool like she's very invested in the
whole process she helps me a lot with
just taking care of everything as well
she's a very big support i mean she's
never been anti yet
but now she's just kind of like what the
hell yeah yeah but now she's just like
yeah all in and she's yeah biggest fan
last question related
folks out there watching this
they're younger they're really starting
to get passionate about
fitness folks around them friends family
parents
grandparents
great grandparents
ghosts of great great great christmas
yes
which visit unitely clearly yeah
they don't maybe approve or are confused
what as a individual can you do
or what should you do or maybe what
shouldn't you do
in order to
ameliorate or remediate that dichotomy
of you love this but everyone else is
like matt and to sort of put the
perspective here
i'm not even because a lot of people are
like you'll have these like instagram
pages for like motivation and
empowerment it's like tell everyone
around you like this is the real me
you're just gonna have to get used to it
well you don't even know you're
exploring and also like pronouncing to
people that like dude shut up and you
love me forever it's kind of rude maybe
what is your approach to like if people
are like i'm doing this thing and
everyone around me is kind of like matt
or maybe disapproving
it is your advice just grind to make
something out of yourself and eventually
everyone recognize or is your advice hey
tell people like hey i like this and if
you have any questions about it i can
answer them or what do you think what is
that what is the way forward like what i
did personally was i just grant ground
through it sure and then it got my
success and eventually it worked you
never managed to you never bothered to
explain or just yeah
and but my advice would be to do exactly
that because the reason why people fear
things the reason why people get angry
or upset is because of lack of
understanding and it's just a poor
communication so that was
in the past my bad of not understanding
why i'm doing it or where i'm going with
it as well
i didn't really have an understanding on
that so what's your plan you're like i
don't know yeah i'm just going to lift
weights for the best you know pt the
rest of my life with personal training
clients on the floor that was my thing
but had i had more awareness of it for
myself better understanding of why i'm
doing things and how and where it may be
going like not a set like 20-year
business
but just some kind of vision to be able
to then communicate and say look this is
not just what i love to do or not what i
want to do because that doesn't really
compel your parents you know if we all
do what we wanted to do all the time
like with the he's miss bluster
that's all i would do just 24 7. um
it's got to be something where we say
this is not just what i once wanted to
this is this is why i'm doing it and
this is what i think could be a
beneficial thing and it may be it may be
a negative experience too but i need to
go through a journey myself i need to
learn that it's not a good thing and
this is my life and i'm not gonna say
fuck you i'm gonna do what i want but
it's most like this is like you've got
to let me go through my my journey and
and i'm making a conscious decision to
do this and i'm doing my best to
have as much evidence behind why i'm
doing it and even if it is wrong because
it won't always end up in a positive way
totally i have a whole gymnastics career
i don't talk
okay we'll unpack that later um
but even yeah it's just about as long as
you can communicate them and just be
open i didn't open those doors to my
parents and open those doors my friends
my family i just said i'm gonna do my
thing and that caused me a lot of
negativity and a lot of anxiety and a
lot of stress that could have been
mitigated it might not have gone away
completely but it could have been
minimized yeah it could be handled
better and may not have had as much of a
negative impact on me mentally
emotionally and on them emotionally as
well just by talking excellent excellent
that was awesome thank you so much
lastly i'll just make sure i say this on
camera i didn't know who the fuck you
were before we met legend
you're just the fucking man it's been an
incredibly pleasant experience
and and from now on if anyone ever asked
me like eugene theo said you should do
an exercise like this but you say this
what do you think i'll be like we're
just buddies man i'm not gonna whatever
you should trash talk me i'd be like you
should say he's got 100 pounds less
bodyweight than me who do you think is
correct
i go further i'm like honestly i think
he's smart he's just a mean guy and i
just wouldn't follow him because he's a
mean person yeah he hit me in the face
off camera he hurt me
he bullied me and i don't want to talk
about it anymore
i think that's appropriate yeah yeah i
accept that and we end on that note
we're beefing hard like subscribe and
give this man a follow he has a trillion
more followers than me so you know what
i'm saying if you came here looking for
him give give us a follow lamborghinis
absolutely don't pay for themselves
unless you run a lamborghini farm and
invest the lamborghinis back into
themselves
talk off camera about camera we're
getting rich guys
