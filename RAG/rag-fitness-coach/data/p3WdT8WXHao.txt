[Music]
doctor pack here in the real Hospital
aka the gym where we actually save lives
real doctors in the house here with Joe
Ham watch Enthusiast and bicep uh muscle
belly insertion hit them with a double
bicep BSC official n there you go
register dition or something not even
that not even that here's my citation
that's the citation thank thank you for
being in the video we'll see you
later joking aside though we are here
with Joe ham and myself to take you
through a an actually effective 5 minute
hypertrophy workout yes in just 5
minutes we'll be able to get plenty of
working in the form of a bunch of super
sets as a one giant set doing a few
exercises for the upper body cuz who
trains legs Q videos of me squatting
heavyweight here's your citation but
joking aside
this video is not supposed to
demonstrate one specific workout that
only works with these exercises or
whatever you can take this concept and
the way I do things and create your own
5 to 10 minute workout cool so what
we'll do I'll have my man Joe here timey
we're going to do cable chest push Downs
overhead tricep extensions and then
straight to the preacher curl bicep
machine we're going to go back to back
on every exercise and do as many rounds
as we can until 5 minutes is
up all
right whenever you say
go I will go
go all right we've
started this is way too light we're
wasting precious
time count this as a warm-up all right
maybe let's restart the Go part all
start again yeah cool that was that was
going to look at the weights now I
myself did a 22nd hypertrophy workout
this morning that's my sex
life all right so now it's the real
beginning of the workout and
go
nice the usual stuff applies control
your
entric get a nice stretch
and we'll take every set to
failure not even that not even
that come
on all right straight to the next
one full stack YOLO
nice one minute
gone four minutes of straight gains
left perfect
partials so we could have included a
back exercise as well but I wanted to
hit the viewers with a chest and arm
workout cuz who trains back many of us
do back is awesome to train but hey ho
we are getting some tricep action from
the push Downs as well that's my comment
but hey ho all righty
this is not actually em merging science
this is uh actually a typical workout
for every male between the ages of 18 to
22 on a Friday night at 10:00 chest arms
ready to do some butt stuff we call it
the night outer all right how much time
do we have left sir just show 3
minutes in we go but that's enough about
my sex
life no way you can have sex for 3
minutes bro what are can if you can if
you do it three times come on
start and if you stay in a length and
position go on
in let's go halfway
both halfway with the time and the Reps
just the way we like
it notice the lack of weight decrease
for those of you crying about short rest
periods for
Britain for the
Allies for
twist for the real
doctors woo we're back in
baby you can see the sweat
gleaming of that beautiful beautiful
head just filled with citations and Cit
about
hypertrophy book coming soon book coming
soon I haven't announced that but hey
hey just did I just announced it one
minute last minute last minute let's
make it
count In The Bleak
Midwinter peeky blind is reference but
the only thing peeking around here are
pack
biceps and the viewers engaged
come on in let's
go woo come on you got 40 seconds let's
go that's what she
said and then I paid her another
$5 some money I owed her we were doing
the 5minute
workout she said I have 40 seconds
left and then I was like here's the
money I owe you she was my previous
editor 15 seconds of biceps go
run viewers this is the first cardio
pack has done
since my blood work against anybody's
blood work on any day 4 3 2
1 probably too much hypertrophy
now viewers
do not try this at home that needed some
adjustment but hey we're not even out of
breath here 5 minutes 16 seconds show
them editor edit over the the thing so
it says 5 minutes and 16 seconds instead
of 3 hours there you go what a realistic
edit but goes to show we could have
easily extended this by five more
minutes taking a tiny uh tiny break in
between and we got done three sets of
chest with some tricep work in there
three sets of overhead tricep extension
for that long head tricep and three sets
of biceps throw in let me get the pump
in unfortunately I'm wearing
the dump cover the pump cover dump cover
and dump cover as well there's the dump
cover given the fact that I'm a dump
but I digress 10% off Dr pack code rasal
apparel get yours now that said though
we could have easily thrown in some sets
of Chip spin-ups or even some l pull
Downs or um what I'm going call it cable
prayers easy back work 10 minutes in and
out sure it's not the optimal amount of
volume for a week's work but you do this
twice a week chest and arms you're solid
10 minutes in and out chest pump
sweating recipe for success in every
area of life and that's it grind
