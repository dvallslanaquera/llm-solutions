[Music]
we are here
uh back after a few hours after am
session back
we're doing pm session right now uh
finishing off with some
biceps and some side delts and
maybe a little trap upper back action uh
keep it easy nothing too crazy
uh yeah let's get to it
[Music]
i think currently my physique looks
looks decent
looks okay like slightly above average i
think i'll do
pretty well at a local show maybe but
who knows anything happened
i look in the mirror i'd say most days
i go yeah that's all right it's fine
it should be bigger should be leaner at
this stage
mostly unimpressed but like oh we're
getting somewhere
you know things are improving here and
there
[Music]
so like you know my secret to shedding
all this fat
last week at prep all natural
all organic non-gmo
no chemicals zero matter
actually uh right now second exercise
uh hit some side delts i'm going to be
doing some
seated dumbbell laterals um i find
that the seated version for me from time
to time
is good to use because uh i can use less
weight get similar stimulus
um and uh it helps ward off some
local fatigue i get in my elbows so
that's a really good time especially now
a week and a half
after the show to use
[Music]
[Music]
this delta is freaking me out a little
bit though
i don't hate my body at all i enjoy
looking at it
uh because i can always see room for
improvements
if i see room for improvement i know i
can make a plan to make those
improvements
so that's exciting to me it gives me
something to strive for
so when i do post online and like make
you know
little comments about myself people say
that's not tiny
you know you have biodysmorphia all that
stuff
i really don't i don't think i do you
know maybe they think i do
and uh i mean maybe a medical
professional think i might
but uh i think it's only an issue if it
negatively negatively affects you
in any sort of way
[Music]
[Music]
punch rear
delt fly i'm doing a giant set this is
my intensity technique
charlie's probably gonna do something
similar uh we've discussed giants in the

very soon i don't know how i'll do
against the competition
i hope i do okay to be quite honest
i'm going into this mainly to you know
get nationally qualified
so that's i can do a national show this
year
this year but for that current show
coin toss maybe you know i'll do fine
maybe i won't so that rounds out
pm session for wednesday
of the last week of training before my
first show
this jared here
staring at me for no goddamn reason but
you know we love him anyway
he's a little special we keep him around
i don't like to make contest predictions
because i
uh there's a lot of probability involved
a lot of things go wrong
somebody can show up that's a freak you
know right now in st
louis area there's people making contest
predictions for their friends
and they have no idea charlie's showing
up i would hate to be that guy this is
like you're winning this class and then
you see charlie you're like i mean
second place is good
because that guy is not from earth i'll
say put this way
charlie is going to be one hell of a guy
to beat whoever beats him is going to be
really really good whoever beats him is
destined to be
a good ifbb pro not just a regular ip
bro look the gym's fine it's great
muscles get big look at these guys
fucking animals right
