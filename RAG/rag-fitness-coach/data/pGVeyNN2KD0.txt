boom just like a machine totally fine if
you struggle with stimulating your lats
what you could do is come down nice and
quick but then on the way back up you
may want to slow the Ecentric really
control it and really feel your elbows
traveling up in an arc only restrained
by your lats touch and then slow and let
your elbows Arc and then touch and then
slow it's going to want to bounce right
off your chest slow it down immediately
even below your chin
h control and then you're good to go
