muscle gain dieting made simple video
number two
in our probably ten part series dr mike
here for renaissance periodization
let's get going today's video hopefully
you've seen video number one which
should be linked
uh or actually just on your tab right
over to your right or below you
depending on if you're using a cell
phone or not
choosing high quality foods so in the
last video
we talked about standardizing the intake
and essentially just getting a measure
of how much food you're eating proteins
carbs fats and of course total calories
if you multiply all those out and that's
cool because now we know how much food
we're eating
but that's not enough not nearly enough
because
we want to make sure we take in yeah
those macros are good and we'll talk
about
getting more specific macros later but
we don't eat macros okay we eat actual
foods
and before we start talking about
manipulating macros we need a good
baseline
of making sure we're eating the kinds of
foods that do essentially two things and
one supports the other
health which supports muscle growth and
muscle growth
okay so there's some food categories
that are slightly better choices than
others
for example we want to make sure the
macros are the most nutritious we can
possibly get getting us vitamins
minerals fiber phytochemicals etc
and that is going to be really good for
our overall health
and good truth be told gaining muscle on
purpose especially past a certain point
is maybe not the most healthy thing ever
especially gaining a lot of weight
gaining muscle is good but gaining
weight isn't that great
you of course always have to gain weight
muscle plus fat before you lean down and
turn that just into muscle
so we want to stay as healthy as
possible in general in addition some
foods just grow muscle better
for example you can have some
foods and some sources of food that give
you better pumps which probably supports
more muscle growth
in addition and this is huge a lot of
the foods you're going to eat on your
mass gaining plan give you tons of
energy
because mass gain training is really
really hard and you don't want to eat
foods from sources that kind of slow you
down and bog you down a lot of junk
foods do that
healthier foods and better sources tend
to give you lots of energy especially
when you need it
so you can have the most productive
training so yeah we're gaining weight
by adding calories but we're going to
make sure that the foods we choose
macros aside are all kind of the better
foods for mass gaining
for health for performance and for
eventually actually gaining you more
muscle
so what is the structure there what are
the foods
that tend to promote muscle growth the
best and health the best and so on and
so forth well for protein sources
lean meats are hard to beat lean dairy
products are excellent
cottage cheese yogurt stuff like that
greek yogurt is really great uh
milk is kind of the massing food of the
gods and of course lean high quality
vegan sources are also an option
for carbs veggies are good you never
want to reduce them completely although
we'll talk about later in
sort of the trials and tribulations the
struggles part of the video series
where sometimes you want to reduce your
veggies a little bit just to be able to
get more food in
but a core healthy carb intake revolves
around veggies
fruits and whole grains including whole
grain breads
those aren't the only foods you're going
to be eating on masking but they'll form
the core
if you're really pushing your body
weight up really struggling eating we're
going to learn later
that you take the whole grains you
reduce them a little bit take the fruits
and veggies reduce them a little bit
and put in some more refined grains or
grains that don't have a fibrous husk
like white rice for example or regular
pasta versus holy pasta and brown rice
we'll get to that later but this should
be the core of your starting
and then those modifications can be used
if they need to be used otherwise
if you can gain mass just on pure
healthy sources oh my god that's all
around a great thing
for fats you want to rely on
monounsaturated heavy sources so sources
of fat that are predominantly
monounsaturated fat
because on average for a wide variety of
outcomes those tend to be the healthiest
probably also support the most muscle
growth and the least fat accumulation
and there's some direct literature to
confirm
that so olive oil canola oil nuts nut
butters avocado stuff like that
they're also incredibly fats have nine
calories per gram
and a lot of these healthy fats like if
you put some olive oil in your chicken
and rice
it actually makes your chicken and rice
taste better and go down easier
but with more calories that's crazy so
it's kind of like a win-win
a lot of what we're going to be doing is
modulating calories by adding
carbohydrate later in the series
but adding healthy fats is also a great
way to do this and very healthy and very
easy and very cheap
and very tasty so those healthy fat
sources are really going to keep in our
back pocket hopefully not literally you
walk around with an avocado in your back
pocket i guess that kind of work if you
sit down and crush this
maybe side pocket but in any case we're
going to keep those fats on deck
ready to be introduced if we just can't
eat any more food and we have to eat a
lot more
so now anytime you eat
lots of food for your massing attempt
you're going to choose mostly the
healthy sources we just described
we got the macros down we're counting
macros we don't know exactly which
macros we should target yet we've just
we're just doing what we have been we
have the food quality up we're eating
mostly healthy foods now
next video we'll make sure that the
actual macros we're taking in
align with best practices we'll see you
next week
for that video peace
you
