[Music]
hola Chicago
Ultra Flex Fitness
JK what up family you know I can't speak
Spanish to save my life I have one
advantage I can make the sounds go okay
because soy Russo if you don't know what
that means you want to speak Spanish
either baby Jerry you speak a little
Spanish say something
vamos
that's all we need to hear Marissa and
uh John Won everything in powerlifting
straight up ran out of shit to win
she is Aunt sized but elephant strong
laughs
where's it the other way around in any
case we'll find out soon
he is going to be training her back
believe it or not
her entire athletic history minus like
three years when she was 17 years old is
in powerlifting so I know she looks like
a busy athlete but she's just getting
back into the mix what a better way to
get back in the mix than get right into
the fucking blender for an insane RP
back workout Jared Marissa she's gonna
be okay after this yes yeah we'll see
yeah yeah you already have a paper we do
have a safe word and the safe word is um
comma daddy we're pronounced in a way
that I can't say on YouTube because they
would flag us for porn let's get into
the workout
[Music]
foreign
why are we over here doing lat pull
Downs when apparently the first exercise
is going to be pull-ups the reason is
that just like you don't just get into
your working weight of bench presses
right away on a first set you got to
warm up the same thing applies to
pull-ups and we use the pull down to
warm up for the pull-up so typically
we'll do something like a set of 12 very
light with like a 30 rep max then we go
do a set of eight with something a
little bit heavier like a 20 or 15 rep
max and then we do a set of three or
four something pretty damn heavy and or
that set of three or four gets replaced
and a set of two to three pull-ups is
done with the actual pull-up and then
boom we are ready for pull-ups now if
you can do quite a few pull-ups a really
awesome thing that you can try is
putting on a little bit of weight doing
a set of two with like 25 or 10 pounds
hanging and then after you're done with
that starting your working weight and if
it's just your body weight it's going to
feel a lot lighter because the
potentiation your nervous system wakes
the hell up for that heavier weight
lighter weight the reps are easier your
stimulus to fatigue is better your mind
muscle connection is better and there's
a gentleman that clearly wants something
from this rack and I'm taking up spaces
get the fuck out of here people might
not know this but Marissa was on Ellen
DeGeneres doing pull-up dancing it's
pretty impressive so yeah a compliment
from Jared strange hard to come by they
are yeah they are you can touch your
chest
to the bar it's no longer a rep if you
can't touch your chest without strict
technique so when you can't just slowly
lower as if you're gonna do another
pause at the bottom and then just fine
that's good and each pause at the bottom
gives it for real pause okay okay no
rush start starting that deep stretch
position right there every rep needs to
be right there
down slow
[Music]
two beautiful not quite that slow a
little fast there you go
there
good
yes
and that's it slow slow slow slow
and rack good stuff
excellent excellent that's better crazy
impressive that was beautiful we are
gonna do technically two exercises for
vertical pull with Marissa but it's
really just one exercise the first
multiple sets three to five sets are
gonna be loaded the second
three to four sets are going to be
unloaded
Marissa is so fucking strong but she can
do decent reps with a crapload of weight
hanging which for anyone is good for a
female is ridiculous
and we're gonna take advantage of that
strength and do weighted Pull-Ups
why do we just do regular pull-ups after
we tend to notice that weight
potentiates your nervous system so much
that regular pull-ups function
essentially as assisted pull-ups after
they allow you to really get in touch
with a crazy mind muscle connection the
technique feels super stable and smooth
after weighted pull-ups you would be
remiss not to try some unloaded pull-ups
because the feel is just going to be
that good
up go go damn you chin up
oh good slow
we'll get you back for that one up yeah
no worries Daddy oh yes okay safe work
yes
I actually did it
all right unclip if you can this could
take this could take a minute
thank you
foreign
[Music]
back muscle there you go
five
oh these are perfect
slow that's it relax
Good Start perfect they were very good
um
my forearms ago
before anything yeah you're feeling your
back somewhat here yes yeah I definitely
fell in my back I always just feel like
my forearm skin but with the straps no
big deal they just hurt a lot still yeah
I hate that you guys might notice that
those of you watching
the straps can take away
the limiting factor but they don't take
away the pain and the reason there's
some kind of song
like I can be your hero baby remember
that shit yes I can take away your pains
he's saying it approximately like that
what was it uh Iglesias yeah Enrique
Iglesias yeah
boom
oh that's perfect
yes slow stretch
that's it that's the last one slow slow
slow and rack
beautiful
very good looking at yourself
why not I don't know it's distracting
so enthralled with yourself you're doing
pull-ups you're like oh look at you
Marissa can you see your face your own
face it's right I mean look if you look
like me it's really frightening
if you look like Jared I don't know
people have their tastes one one last
set here Marissa one last set Marissa
that was an amazing rep do it again
oh my God perfect
all day two more
[Music]
up up slow as if another as if another
is if another is if another
amazing amazing amazing amazing wow
that's really earning that shit
good stuff I will not like you guys this
is what it feels like to be like oh hold
on go back up go back up
yourself
so what does it feel like okay look down
at people apparently Marissa can do some
unbelievable slow eccentric pull-ups you
may find these to be the hardest thing
in the world
but now that she's done and drinking her
Gatorade
which we are in fact sponsored by I'm
kidding Gatorade doesn't know we exist
we're gonna go pick a rowing variation
and Jared is going to coach Marissa up
she's going to do rose but she is a
refined lady and not one of the
you fill in the blank it rhymes with
rose
[Music]
Pull-Ups three sets of unweighted
pull-ups now it's time for rowing we're
gonna hit two row variations today
uncharacteristic of us but new gym new
me
we're gonna do some low rows first for
probably about three or four sets and
then we're gonna try to do some kind of
higher row variation hit the back from
all sorts of different angles so that
when you see your crush in the mall with
her skinny boyfriend you can turn and
hit that fucking angle with the back and
the boyfriend's like damn it Stacy your
YouTube RP follower future boyfriend is
here I hate him I'm inadequate he's
gonna fuck off you're gonna get in there
Stacy's gonna be like you saved me and
then you're gonna
wake up and go to the gym so you can do
that shit in real life let's do it
amazing we got more come on keep going
Marissa all day here
[Music]
yes slow Big Stretch
your chest on the top
oh that was it Oh I thought you said one
more
you're doing great this time will
actually push you
I was only getting thrown
slow and deep
so you guys might have noticed that
Marissa is taking her elbows and pulling
them behind her back
you may have also seen people say that
the lats are no longer active in that
range of motion and that's largely
correct the thing they don't follow up
with is the lats in the back are not
synonymous there is an enormous part of
your back dare I say most of your back
that does not last
and the obsession with lab training is
cool and all but if you want an overall
big ass back you've got to do some
movements that take your elbows and pull
them way behind because all kinds of
crazy shit in your mid upper back
actually allows for that to happen and
then that gives you that turtle shell
look so that people see you in the bar
they're like hey man are you are you a
ninja turtle and you're like yeah so
what if I am motherfucker and they're
like oh geez okay sorry and then just
fuck off that's it you learned something
today
it is okay to lose your composure let's
do it
yes pull further back
go forward and slow as if another as if
you're gonna do another and
oh that was good
tell me you felt something back there I
did awesome that's why I stopped
my shoulders got pumped too
all the way back yes
all the way back there it is oh yeah
at least one more Marissa hardcore pull
back there it is again another one
you got some shit all day let's go
nobody said rest good
one more you got it come on yes slow
Big Stretch rack there's not like eight
reps
I saw that shit that fake mic shit I
know you like pool and you're like oh
it's getting hard every girl knows how
to fake it oh
deflection row involves the muscles
of your upper and lower back it actually
taxes the entire back at the same time
generally you get whatever kind of
attachment you want it's not really
important and if you're a big fat fuck
like me you probably want to put
something heavy or something solid that
touches the cable attachment so that you
don't get dragged forward but Marissa's
a tiny tiny person so she might actually
be able to do it without it
what you're going to do
is round your entire back
your whole thing and the more weight you
have the more you're around
and then you're going to come up and
when your lower back hits a 90 degree
angle completely vertical you're going
to stop leaning back and the rest of the
movement is generated by spinal
extension
and retraction of your elbows big slow
forward lean huge stretch even hold for
a second Arch tummy out chest up touch
for a split second and go again and you
can do this where you touch and hold for
a second which Marissa's probably going
to do today or you can do this where you
Big Stretch and then just gently touch
and come right back down
dealer's choice
good
one last one big pull
forward
slow as if another
and rap
good stuff
all right two more plates
you sandbagging motherfucker
I think it's better to sandbag instead
of the other way right instead of
overshooting yes
try another one you got this cool hearts
pulse let's go yes more one more
[Music]
hard
oh yeah one more let's go Marissa
one more keep it up
keep it up there's always another one
coming in don't you dare fucking relax
keep going
you got this all day world champion
means something right
you're supposed to be there we go
another one
you got it
Tower fuck yeah oh that's it that's it
good slow and rack good stop doing hard
all right one hard set out of the
channel good job
because Ken have you guys talking shit
that's why we talked that shit that's
good that was very good this is actually
a very good exercise uh for assistance
work for power lifters especially to
pull conventional it's a way to
load the spinal Erectors a ton without
loading your spine much yeah in the in
the not so common cases that more spinal
erector work is something you can even
recover from this can really Harden your
ass up and especially if you're taking a
break from conventional deadlifting for
psychological reasons because you're
like sometimes just fuck tired of
deadlifting this exercise can thicken up
your back so when you come back to
deadlifting you're like oh shit like my
spinal reactors are bigger and strong
you touch that tummy use some power from
the bottom
now down slow one last one coming up
apart slow
slow all the way stretch slow slow slow
slow slow and rack good stuff I think I
hit my stomach
[Music]

abused good and that's how we know it's
successful we're good to go can you stop
fucking hitting me I'm sorry elbow twice
