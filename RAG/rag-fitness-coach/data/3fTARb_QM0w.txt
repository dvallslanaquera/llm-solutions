way number one is your body metabolizes
or expels toxins through any number of
routes including delicious Sprouts like
the liver urine sweat vomit Etc
I suppose you probably even expel toxins
if you do the thing with the things in
your eyes and you're like you flicking
at somebody randomly in the street you
never do that of course you don't you're
a good person why would you do something
crazy like that in any case yep sure
your body does that automatically for
itself
the liver and kidneys are super ultra
important for stuff like that
