hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization and guess what
the long-awaited scientific principles
of hypertrophy training
book is out and the link to buy it is in
the description below
holy crap it only took like 18 years to
write or whatever
it's awesome a ton of the stuff we talk
about on this channel
is explained incredibly in incredibly
high detail in this book
it is for advanced audiences so if this
is your first rodeo watch some
hypertrophy made simple videos watch the
other videos on our channel
our book does come with a list of
recommended prerequisite reading
recommended not mandatory but there's a
lot of other books that you probably
should or could benefit from reading
before you read ours however if you're
in that advanced camp or really just
want to challenge yourself
then the book is out now
you can go buy the book whatever you
like because it's on the store at
renaissance purestation.com
link right below but here's a cool bonus
over the next 32 weeks or something like
that
once a week we are going to be releasing
a very long detailed concept video
called hypertrophy concepts and tools i
think they're like 32 or 33 of them
each video dives super in depth about a
tool or concept a tool for hypertrophy
training or a concept of hypertrophy
training
that is discussed in the book so it's
discussed at great length in the book
then the videos take that great link
expand upon it
tons of examples tons of individual
scenarios so you get an
awesome supplementary guide for free on
youtube so
mark your calendars and click on your
notifications because every week
one of those hypertrophy concepts and
tools videos are going to be out and if
you
read the book beforehand or read along
you are going to understand those videos
super super well and make use of them in
your own training
if these are really advanced videos if
you just watch them without reading the
book
they're going to make some sense but
you're going to have a ton of questions
that the book can answer so folks
remember
lamborghini insurance does not pay for
itself i have 10 lamborghinis
i need money buy the book i need money
