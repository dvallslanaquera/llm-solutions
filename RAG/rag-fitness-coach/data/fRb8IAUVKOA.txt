band assisted pull-ups couple problems
with them bands actually provide more
resistance for you at the bottom and
less at the top which is the opposite of
the force curve that you naturally get
from your anthropometry and muscle
function doing pull-ups as pull-ups get
to the top part that tends to be the
part that you could use a little bit
more assistance in and the bottom part
of pull-ups is actually the most
hypertrophic so if you're big stretching
your lats at the bottom you want more
load there not less so band training can
work and it does but it's limited in a
couple of ways as described and this is
not a very effective tool to increase
