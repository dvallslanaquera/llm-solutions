the leaner you get the harder it is to
keep muscle on your body you have to be
realistic here happens when you
push your body to the extremes so if
you're starting out at twenty percent
body fat you're dieting to 15 or 13 you
can reasonably lose no muscle at all if
you're starting at 10 body fat and
you're dieting to four percent for a
bodybuilding show you can expect to lose
a little bit of muscle I shouldn't shock
you it shouldn't surprise you but it's
not like you did anything wrong it's
just part of the process and you will
regain it back quite quickly I might add
so know what you're getting yourself
into so you're not unrealistic about
what's going on
