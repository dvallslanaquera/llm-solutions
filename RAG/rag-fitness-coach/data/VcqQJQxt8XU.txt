[Music]
let's move it to your
your left and let's see what you look
like with the elbows by your side and
palms facing your thighs
okay okay let's move more to me more to
you up
i just like it because it's like the
fifth element they have the scanner
machine yeah
it reminds me of that
so your toilet body fat is five point
eight percent oh
yeah yeah 13.8 pounds of fat
216.3 pounds of lean mass your bones
weigh 8.8 pounds and weight 238.9
exactly right now and any red which i
don't see much of a red would be that
right these are the red lines no the red
lines are just a grid line
right here
[Music]
hello everyone this is the second puss
day your last one the last push day
correct last
of this prep
[Music]
bro i'm eating like so much fish yeah
the last week in your skin
in my skin brother you know what i'm
saying and i've had
no fluids yeah yeah so last time my
coach uh he took out egg whites because
like
distinction and stuff yeah yeah you know
yeah eggs are bad too
yeah fuck yo yeah the yolk it has so
many carbs
so many carbs bad for your heart and
health that's what makes you fat man
eggs
[Music]
i'm gonna do some flies
just did some wrist curls uh after flies
we'll do some
smith uh presses and then finish
off with some uh smith jms close grip
super sets
but uh yeah time to push it a little bit
but not too hard
as you guys know i you know came from a
paralytic background
training intensity for
powerlifting i had to really get dialed
in mentally
for every single top set for
you know when you're getting especially
closer to a meat and you know that's
very fatiguing in its own way you don't
realize it
but it is but the rest of the time not
that hard
the difference with uh bodybuilding
training is that for me at least
it's much more time consuming doing
these am pm sessions
i do you have to make that commitment
to scheduling around it which is like
kind of another task on top of that
[Music]
i'm not i'm a fake bodybuilder scott
says i'm an instagram bodybuilder
oh oh i mean until last year okay
wrong
[Music]
moderate grip smith presses with a
positive bottom
uh higher reps on these aiming for
also like mid-teens on my first set and
then uh
going for about three sets here i'm
doing these on smith machine
because uh i get very good stimulation
on my target muscles without creating
additional fatigue
elsewhere uh barbell movements great to
have
but the trade-off for me is at least
i get way more wrist elbow shoulder
issues with those uh in relation to
the amount of stimulus i get i'm a pussy
that's the shorter way to put it
thanks matsy for teaching me the ways
let's go
[Music]
a little heavier yeah
finishing off this am session with
some smith jm
presses superset it into
some postscripts
[Music]
when you have a good power leveling
workouts and you hit that number you
wanted to hit
or more you feel like the man they're
like nothing can stop you
that day or that way you just like
you're like harping on it in your own
head
but you have a bat like you missed that
lift you needed crush my morale
like one bad lift you could have a great
week of training and you missed that
last lift
that you needed to hit in your own head
or like whatever you wrote down
it just like put me in a grumpy mood
like all day long
or longer but for bodybuilding for me
has never been the case i know some
people say you know if you don't have a
good pump here and there you feel like
you know
yeah but you know that's that's the
extent of it goes you go meh
it could have been better but uh that's
about it
uh i've only had neutral or good
experiences
after my bodybuilding training sessions
in regards to that
because you know you don't really miss
lifts i mean you might
have one less rep that you wanted here
and there
but overall you know you're getting
stimulus and that's what you're aiming
for and
yeah i mean like i've always been a good
head state after every single
bodybuilding training session
just finished up final
a.m procession of uh this uh
prep everything felt good on target
got a nice pump going match last week's
uh volume just up intensity
a tiny bit uh yeah but everything felt
great
um gonna rest a few hours
and then come back for pm session
