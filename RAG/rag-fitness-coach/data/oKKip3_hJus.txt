welcome back to another video in this
series
now in this video i believe i was 13
weeks out
today i wanted to touch on a few topics
first up i want to talk about moving
places and why my
microphone quality slash background
noise is a bit worse than usual
secondly i want to talk about how to
modify training while traveling
and or using different gyms i want to
talk about
how to minimize risk of getting ill
while traveling and finally i wanted to
talk about my
thoughts on how prep has gone so far
and how i've enjoyed it and how i think
it'll unfold as i go forward
so first up i have recently moved places
so i now live in a different apartment
which has meant a bit more life stress
than usual higher neat than usual
and worst sleep which hasn't been ideal
and at the same time i have also
moved to a different neighborhood in
southampton which means there's now a
bit more
background noise as you may or may not
be able to tell
i now live closer to a busy road which
means
yeah just a bit louder in the background
you might hear some traffic
in which case i apologize i'm gonna try
and figure out a solution
to make the audio as good as it can be
but yeah so i recently moved places
which has meant a bit more life stress
and stuff but hopefully the
microphone quality should be acceptable
and well within listenable
next up i wanted to briefly discuss how
to modify training while traveling and
or using different gyms
so in a few days from now i'll be going
to greece for 10 days for holidays
which is why if you're a client of mine
and you try to book a in
during that time you might struggle to
find some available times
because it's my first holiday in
i want to say something like a year and
a half obviously covet hasn't helped
with having holidays um but it's also
just been quite busy
going from one thing to the next from
finishing my undergrad to moving places
a few times in the matter of
a month and a half to starting my phd
through working on the orp
hatchery book to coaching picking up to
start my phd
to the rp internship now um
contest prep it's just been a lot of
stuff going on and now moving places
again
and so
yeah i've moved places now um and i
wanted to discuss how to modify training
while traveling
so i'll be going to increase in a few
days from now for 10 days and
traveling is not very good for training
basically
um traveling generally speaking makes
your sleep a bit worse because you're
not sleeping in the usual conditions and
oftentimes
if you're doing things right your
sleeping environment at home
should be quite optimal so stuff like
your sleep hygiene where
your bedroom is quite dark it's quiet
it's cool
um you like the mattress you like the
bedding etc that should all be optimized
when you're at home
whereas when you're traveling that can
all be quite different and suboptimal
and so typically when you're traveling
your sleep gets worse in addition
it seems like deadlines
or meetings and that sort of thing
generally do cause stress
so for example when you look at students
who are in the exam season
they tend to recover more slowly than
students who aren't currently in exam
season
and so it seems like in general things
with deadlines
that are a bit stressful make recovery
worse
and i think that also applies to
traveling where because you have to
take flights generally speaking
flight schedules might not be the most
ideal for sleeping either where
oftentimes
flights take place overnight especially
if you're booking cheaper flights
overall it just contributes to having
worse sleep and higher stress than usual
and finally depending on where you
travel to there might also be some jet
lag which again
isn't ideal for sleep and typically
isn't ideal for stress either
and so overall traveling just makes your
recovery a lot worse
which means if you want to still
optimize your results from training
you're likely going to have to make some
modifications you can't just train with
the same amount of volume as you usually
would
because then if your recovery is worse
but you're still trading with the same
volume
you can over train or you can overreach
for a few days and under recover
which means you could have to deal it
early to make up for the excess fatigue
or it just means for example you get
injured or you're just not
making as many gains as far as muscle
growth goes as you could and so overall
it just means you have to make
modifications for trading while
traveling
you also typically are using different
gyms so unless you're traveling within
your own city somehow in which case
ignore what i'm saying because it
doesn't really apply much
but almost always you'll use a different
gym with different equipment
and just a different setup in general
which also means you're gonna have to
make some modifications
uh to adjust your program
to make it as effective as it can be
generally speaking for using different
gyms what you're going to want to do is
find similar but effective exercise
selection options
so let's say i for example today i train
at a different gym which you'll see in
next week's video i trained a different
gym because i was trading with a friend
and i had to do some hack squats but the
gym i was training out was a pal thing
gym
and it did not have a hack squat instead
it had a pendulum squat
now i was able to substitute pendulum
squads for hack squats but that was only
because the pendulum squat machine
was quite a good machine it was able to
give me a good sfr
and accomplish a similar goal to
what the hex cup would have and so in
this case
replacing hack squats with pendulum
squats was a good option
however there are certain cases where
i remember training in this one
bodybuilding chain for example where
which will not be named where
the dip station so where one does dips
was so unstable
and basically broken that it was coming
off the wall
and while i could have
you know persisted in doing dips as my
program called for
i instead decided to do another exercise
because trying to do dips that would
have given me such a poor sfr
that trying to mimic the exercise i was
usually doing
would have actually been a last choice
and swapping out that exercise for
something else
like for example a dumbbell press or a
tricep extension
may have actually been the better choice
because the dips would have had such a
poor sfr that it just wasn't worth it
but most of the time what you want to do
provided the sfr or the exercise is good
enough in that gym you're training in
you want to substitute that exercise for
something similar that accomplished the
trains the same muscle groups
accomplish the similar goal ideally has
a similar weight system
so for example if you're usually doing
high bar squats and using seven plates
and the jimmy training at now has those
same plates try to use those same plates
just because that makes it easier to
ensure you're trading with sufficient
load weight et cetera
and you can actually check whether or
not your performance is improving week
to week
whereas if you're using different plates
a different bar et cetera et cetera it
can be harder to assess recovery because
you're not actually sure how much you're
lifting relative to how many how much
you're lifting last week
so in general try and keep things the
same if you can't
make substitutions that make sense if
the sfr is good on those new exercises
and if you can't do that either then try
and find exercises that
accomplish a similar thing but also have
a good s4
for example if you can do dips in your
other gym you're traveling to right now
do dips but if
the dip station is bad and or it doesn't
have a dip station
try to find a similar exercise that
accomplishes a similar thing for example
a dumbbell bench press which still
trains the chest and tricep
but still has a good sfr and gives your
chest and tricep the stimulus they need
now regarding how to modify training
while traveling specifically
as i mentioned traveling makes you more
stressed out makes you sleep less
and also can elevate your risk for
illness which i'll get to eventually
basically all this means overall is that
your training volume
shouldn't be as high as usual because
you won't be able to recover from it
and or your proximity to failure so
how close your train to failure also
shouldn't be
as fatigued as usual so overall what
this means is
mostly because volume is a bit more
important for growth provided
um you're within around five reps of
failure maybe
provided that's happening volume is more
important for growth than
how close you are to failure exactly
so because of this it likely makes sense
to trade a bit shyer or failure
when traveling compared to when you're
not stressed and not traveling and if
necessary you may also have to reduce
your volume a little bit
so instead of doing 20 sets per week per
muscle group
you might have to down it to say 15
again because you're more stressed than
usual your sleep is worse and so forth
next i want to discuss how to minimize
the risk of getting ill while traveling
one of the things you see in sports
science research and even
just i guess disease research in general
is that traveling generally speaking
increases the risk of getting
for example upper respiratory tract
infections which is just a fancy term
for
a coal essentially if we know that
traveling
increases risk of getting ill and
getting ill is not good for training
because when you're ill
your training either gets worse or you
have to stop training because your
recovery gets worse and so forth
we want to figure out how to minimize
that risk at least
and there's a few things you can do as i
said generally speaking also
less sleep or sleep deprivation does
seem to increase how often you get ill
and so one thing to do would be to try
your best to get still get good sleep
conditions so instead of say sleeping at
the airport
when you know you're not going to sleep
very well maybe getting a hotel room
somewhere
where you you know like the mattress
like the bed etc
that can be helpful and also where you
have good sleeping conditions like
not much noise etc so that's one thing
to do
basically you want to make sure every
other factor you can control
besides actually traveling itself is in
your favor as far as minimizing risk of
getting ill
so improve your sleep by actually
getting a good sleep setup if possible
then try to minimize stress try to
anticipate things try to be there plenty
in advance so you don't get stressed out
um try to plan things out properly in
advance
then there's a few things you can do
hygiene wise it seems like washing your
hands pretty often
is a good thing uh generally speaking
social distancing
probably not a bad idea sleep hygiene
keeping a fairly consistent sleep
schedule
um still brushing your teeth still
keeping good
hygiene as far as your personal
belongings go
yeah those are the main things just sort
of general hygiene things but if you're
usually
only somewhat conscious of good hygiene
when you're traveling
it might make more sense to be even to
be at least a bit more conscious of
hygiene
because personal hygiene and hygiene in
general
is one of the only things you can
control while traveling that actually
reduces
risk of getting ill so i i think the
three main things would be
try to sleep as best you can try to set
up a good sleeping environment
second would be plan things well in
advance try to minimize stress
and the third thing would be try to
practice very good personal hygiene
during that time um
ideally as good as you can especially
stuff like washing hands
anyways i think about wraps it up as far
as
what i wanted to talk about about risk
of getting in while traveling
i guess one more brief thing would be it
does seem like
training a lot as in functionally
overreaching so training
more than what your body can recover
from does seem to increase
risk of getting ill slightly and so
pairing up a period of hard training
with traveling might not be ideal so if
for example
you can choose when you're going to
travel say in week one of your mesocycle
when training is pretty easy
versus week four of your muscle cycle
where training is very hard
it generally makes sense to plan that
traveling for week one
because training quite hard also taxes
your body's recovery capabilities
and can also impair your immune system a
little bit
and immune function generally and so if
you're training very hard
and traveling and have higher stress and
have worse sleep
and you know because you're traveling
it's easier to get sick
overall that can just make it a very bad
environment here come the sirens
hey i knew it was gonna happen um
overall combining poor sleep high stress
lots of training and traveling together
just makes for an environment where
getting sick can be a lot more
likely to happen than if you weren't and
so if you can
plan your traveling to happen while
you're not training hard that's a very
good
shout now in my case i'll be traveling
during
week three of the motorcycle which isn't
the hardest week but it's also not a
super easy week
but at the same time i just had a
maintenance phase
a few weeks ago and i don't feel overly
fatigued so
it's working out fine and also sometimes
you just don't have the
luxury of really choosing when you want
to travel
so in this case i didn't really have
much of a choice because it just worked
out timeline wise with friends and
that stuff um but yeah if you can
and you have the freedom to then try to
plan traveling
for when you're not training super hard
finally for the rest of this video i
want to talk about my thoughts about how
prep has gone so far how i've enjoyed it
and also my sort of posing plans going
forward now briefly
a commenter asked me last week whether i
could post
a video of my posing that's definitely
planned
but for now i didn't actually have any
videos of me posing
for this week of training so i didn't
post it um
but the next time i'll train i'll get a
video of me posing
and upload it at the end i'll sort of
talk you through
i guess some key points for each pose um
i'm definitely an expert at posing by
any means i think
like for most things in lifting some
people over complicate posing a little
bit
where they think you know certain
details matter a lot when they usually
don't
um but there are certain key things to
look out for
in each pose much like in most exercises
there are also certain key things to
look out for
and then the rest is sort of like meh
probably doesn't matter much um
so yes i'll take a video of my posing at
some point and walk you through
this gonna have to be a bit more of a
posing emphasis so far i have practiced
some posing but mostly for pictures or
for
my own vanity and so i haven't for
example i've practiced my
right side chest a lot more than my left
side chest and my left
side tricep pose a lot more than my
right side i suppose
and so now it's going to be a matter of
practicing those poses i don't like
hitting
and practicing both sides evenly and
trying to make it symmetrical and so
forth
which i haven't been doing that much and
i don't think many people do unless
they're
pretty deep into bodybuilding but yeah i
think that about wraps up this video
so far call this prep has been nice and
i've enjoyed it 12 weeks out now
around six more kilograms to lose i
believe which is
i think perfect but yeah at any rate if
you enjoyed this video
please leave a like comment subscribe it
helps out and i'll see you next week
