people kept track and log booked their
training for Generations before
high-intensity training took hold in the
80s they made it the most popular and
explain at the best and for that reason
even though you'll see many videos of me
talking that shit about Mike mener and
hit because I got a lot to say that's
critique worthy I'm still and we are
still eternally indebted to this
philosophy for trying to make some
goddamn sense out of the lifting World
instead of settling for Joe the fucking
Bouncer from New Jersey like fucking
overthinking it just fucking go in there
fucking lift hard fucking wait just
fucking boom boom boom hey thanks buddy
good advice
