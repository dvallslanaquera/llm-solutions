I walk into the gym and I watch you
cheat do cheat curls after a set of
strip curls I'm going to guess that
you're being a you just
didn't think through now there's a
chance I'm wrong there's a chance you
really thought it through and this is
actually the best RSM or sfr exercise
that you have available to you and
that's totally cool just make sure that
you're not using any justification you
can to continue to cheat just to use
more weight I know I've been there like
back when I wasn't as strong as I am now
it like you program
your curls like what the 55 lbs
this is dumb as the girl next to
you is curling 65 the are you
supposed to ask that on a date if
you're weak in the hurry he notice you a
Curlin 65 it's kind of hot you know I'm
kind of on my way up there myself maybe
one day but maybe we'll catch some
coffee before then you guys like that do
you feel seduced you should that's right
I got game in any case
