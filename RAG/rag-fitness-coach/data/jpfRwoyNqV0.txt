oh it's good to be back it's been a
little bit
hopefully you guys got the memo dr james
dr mike here for our
bi-weekly webinar dr mike how's it going
uh good i like that you called it
bi-weekly i've been experimenting with
all sorts of different genders
and it's a fun world out there oh my
goodness well
i my head is in as you can see my
disheveled appearance
i am just recovering from spending we
made like a mattress dungeon
in my basement and we recorded um the
scientific principles of hypertrophy
and the evidence-based habit building
books and it took like eight days of
just like
full fucking recording every single day
it was
it was rough so i'm recovering i'm still
like just
not well but uh we'll get it done we're
going we're doing it
dude you know i have a mattress dungeon
in my house but it's not for recording
it's for yelling there's a there's
there's a
a significant amount of latex in that
dungeon is there not i have no comment
absolutely
all right well before we get too stupid
let's get to some of these questions
first up from what must be
the united kingdom with such a name
andrew atkinson
mr bean i believe his real name is rowan
atkinson oh really
it's not mr bean that's kind of
disappointing like his first name is
mr er and the last name
he's like in high school people are like
are you some kind of stupid or something
he's like yeah
yeah yeah well he got 65 upvotes on this
this is a heavy heavy hitter hi docs
what would you say is the hardest
piece of your own advice for you to take
yourself
for me this one's easy uh deloading when
systemic fatigue gets high enough to
fuck up my sleep and
my mood and it starts to really uh
make gym performance increases still
possible but
like i'm not sure how much hypertrophy
is going on versus just
a pretty even balance of um you know
muscle degradation muscle synthesis at
that point just spinning wheels
it is difficult for me to be like okay
time to deload
because the other thing's annoying it's
boring and nobody wants to do it i don't
want to fucking do it
um and it's especially in a cutting
phase like a fat loss phase
when the show is coming up or the end of
the diet is coming up you know like fuck
this d load shit
it gets real tough to deload when you're
not even in contest shape yeah the
contest is like six weeks away
i think what the fuck am i doing dealing
this is awful so
it's tough and i i've i have erred i
have sinned
against the fatigue management gods and
um you know like i went to fatigue
management catholicism what is that
james what do you guys do when you go in
there and you tell the priest some shit
and he
promises not to touch you anymore
confession
wow wow so many directions so many
directions that would that one can go
but yes i i think that's a relatable one
for everybody i think everybody's kind
of had that moment where they're like
yeah it's deload time but i'm just kind
of
not quite feeling it or maybe i didn't
train as hard as i should have and i'm
not quite feeling it or maybe i just
don't want to deload because it's lame
and boring like any combination of those
things i think people can relate to
certainly
i have the the problem of um
uh i don't take my own advice in that
sometimes i misprioritize things
including lifting so when uh like if i
sleep in
a little bit too late maybe because the
dogs were
doing something or whatever i'll get
real fussy and let it ruin my day when
my lifting is not like on track with
what i had planned to do
which is totally not a big deal like you
can just lift a little bit later in the
day or the next day or whatever
you can take a day off now your
schedule's a day off oh well not a huge
deal
but that kind of stuff like will really
get under my skin and i'll really let it
bother me when it shouldn't especially
since i'm not competing i'm not like
striving to be anything other than you
know my herm itself
and so that's something where normally
when my clients report stuff like that
they're like oh i gotta
you know i'm going out of town for a
week or whatever i'm like yeah no big
deal just pick up wherever you left off
and they're like are you sure
like yeah totally no big deal and then
if i sleep in like two hours later than
i
meant to i'm like oh my fucking day's
ruined now i gotta lift at this time and
i gotta do this other shit
you know so that's one of those like do
as i say not as i do
i've been there man i've been there i'm
i get really particular about my
schedule when it's stupid
yeah i think those are very relatable
for a lot of people
next up vasil
jaleev he's got the rp logo going
he was like hey should i ditch the rp
logo is it offensive
or like no dude whatever like you're
fucking golden
yeah it's youtube you can have what you
want like a dick is a logo
[Laughter]
all right he says had to run home from
the gym to watch this
fuck the deload hey speaking of very uh
very on point
idiot you did the wrong thing okay run
back uh i said later edit
mike i've seen you vomit countless times
from doing legs on instagram
it's probably like five but sure if you
can't count to five i'm just kidding
miss you
um you're a pure machine a vomit machine
a vomit machine that would be pretty
accurate charlie jung is a way better
vomit machine than me much more reliably
vomits
i know it's not healthy to do so however
what am i doing wrong in my training
that i don't vomit on squats
the goal is not to vomit like that's not
what you should be aspiring to
necessarily
yeah yeah uh i didn't go as hard as my
legs allow me to
is it because my quads are one half of
yours and the acidity that this is
accumulated is just not enough to cause
a fighter flight mode uh
yeah it's pretty much it you know like
uh a lot of the reason vomiting happens
is because of an increase in total body
uh
acidity and your your stomach contents
are highly acidic so they can
that can go one the other way there's a
couple other other mechanisms but
generally all of them
lacking basically come into like just
huge systemic overdrive um some people
vomit when they're scared because the
systemic like
uh sympathetic responses
so it's definitely something that can
occur um
but you know as your muscles get bigger
relative to the rest of your body
specifically your liver and your heart
and your digestive tract
then the systemic imposition of stress
is just higher and higher and higher
like i can't imagine what somebody like
um
you know branch warren or nick walker
with their legs
i don't i can't even relate to that
probably
you know these guys do like three or
four true working sets per session for
quads and that makes total sense like
once your quads get that big and you're
good at training them hard you don't
need a whole lot because
they're so strong that they just they're
just like icarus to the fire they just
burn themselves up and the rest of your
body with them
so i for years and years and years i
didn't vomit
for legs as a matter of fact i had one
workout once
way back when i probably weighed about
210 to 220 pounds
and for reference i weigh like 240 to
250 right now my quads are way smaller i
actually successfully squatted
225 for 30 straight reps this was all
olympic weightlifting depth and i didn't
throw up dude if i did that now oh my
god i could easily do that now but like
i would be throwing up blood
so uh yeah it's just uh it'll come once
you get big enough you'll start to get
all kinds of weird systemic effects so
here's another one
charlie john specifically when he trains
legs his legs are super freaky big and
strong
it takes him so much central like
systemic drive to train his legs
that he's in a state of like half
drunkenness
for like six hours after a leg workout
like his brain doesn't work all that
well
he'll spontaneously fall asleep on the
bed he can't move he's not even hungry
he has to force feed himself
because his body is like in sympathetic
shock um like
because that's the the imposition of
stress he's capable of doing
think about it this way to your all your
other muscle groups you train quads like
yeah you're not throwing up a seal but
you're
like oh fuck that was hard as fuck i
can't walk i'm kind of queasy i feel so
drained
like think about training your forearms
as hard as possible yeah i know hashtag
pornhub
but on a serious note like six sets of
forearm curls
you're gonna be like um okay so my
forearms hurt and i feel fine
right because the systemic the size of
that muscle just doesn't have a big
systemic head
similar idea yeah and some people just
aren't prone to vomiting like
it's just not something that they do
especially if they just factor in like
diet like if you know like you're not
if you eat like an hour before and then
that's gonna make you vomit like okay
well then that's something that you can
fix
i mean if you want to vomit you can just
put some baking soda in your pre-workout
and some vinegar
in your interest shake and then you'll
be like i'll be like a volcano it'll be
so sweet
just like the fifth grade science
experiment um but yeah so you're not
necessarily missing out on anything by
not vomiting either
you could be doing a perfectly good
program and all of your checks
are in the right places like in terms of
relative intensity volume etc
so i would say like um again don't
compare yourself to dr mike and charlie
in this case and assume that you're
doing something wrong
that's their response based on their you
know training needs and physiology yours
is different you're
not necessarily wrong yeah
yeah next up
eduardo estevez hey i wonder if he's
related to emilio estos emilio
do you know that emilia estevez and
charlie sheen are blood relation
but they just have to oh the rest of us
just took a fake name
oh i can kind of see the resemblance
that makes sense
and they're both charlie sheen's uh
martin sheen's kids
oh interesting why he took a different
name
i think charlie sheen is now hiv
positive oh bummer
because he like did all the drugs and
the sex that he could
well you know right on right now all
right
eduardo estevez says hi docs i've just
started organizing my training using rp
methods and i'm now going to my second
mouse cycle ever
my question regards how to choose how
many muscles are focused on during the
mezzo and how many stay as back burners
so if i pretty much divided my body into
two big groups
and thought of going back and forth in
between them i'm being uh
them being quads sidewa okay we don't
actually need to know because that
sounds sounds fine
that sound like too much chess brother
i'm out of three groups i've been a bro
splitter for 10
dumb years yes i know this question
might have been answered before that's
the first webinar i watch
peace and love from brazil oh brazil
brazilian
dude there's a brazilian crystal my wife
watches this stupid ass show called 90
day fiance it's the worst
oh one of the episodes uh or one of the
characters she's a brazilian woman who's
trying to marry an american guy
and she is so great because i literally
get like i'm like i want to go roll
and do jiu jitsu right after i fucking
watch an episode with her because it
just reminds me of jiu jitsu so much
because she's so brazilian she just
never says like she says likey
i am he like i'm just like this is great
she does every single brazilianism you
can imagine i was like classic classic
so good so good folks if you haven't uh
followed hinato laranja and you want a
good like brazilian spoof
so good he's got it down to us he's got
it down to science
so eduardo generally what we say and
there's more details in the uh
scientific principles of hypertrophy
book james and i co-authored
uh what generally is sorry oh yeah yeah
no go ahead no
real quick on that so um obviously i
recorded the audio book for that that
won't come out for a minute but
the uh paperback is live as of right now
so when you guys see this webinar
that means you can go to amazon or
therapy website and get the paperback
version now if you'd like
sorry i think it's 55.
oh shit yeah so when you do like just
you know fun fact for those of you who
are interested
when you do print on demand uh with
amazon it is based on like page number
color trim size
and a lot of other factors like that so
the bigger it is the more expensive it
is
and the hypertrophy book is free it's a
big book
so you can get much more insight by
purchasing book here but
um generally speaking what you want to
do is be able to reach
each muscle that you train it's local
maximum recovery volume
uh that's the ideal way to train because
it means
the harder you train the muscle the
system is never interfering
it's like for example if you get a point
to where you generally feel pretty good
uh systemically your sleep is good your
desire to train is good
but you get to a point where your chest
stops getting stronger and starts
getting a little weaker because you're
doing that much volume intensity routes
of effort
then you know you've hit your chest mrv
but it's not systemically driven because
your system is fine
on the other hand if you're getting to a
place where your muscles are all
kind of making pretty good gains but
then you start to get really tired your
sleep
tends to get off you start to get really
low motivation low hunger
and you're feeling like the reason
you're stopping on bicep curls isn't
because the muscle is giving out it's
just kind of your soul is giving out
you're like oh i'm just so fucking
uh just forever workout where you're
like i still want to fucking do this
it's not lo nothing local is wrong with
you it's systemic
so generally speaking when you start out
as a beginner you just do
everything uh and because your uh you
know minimum effective volumes are so
low
generally generally maximum recoverables
are so low and also just the systemic
imposition of stress is really low just
like actually from
the vomiting question um you can train
all your muscle groups really really
hard and
you have them reach their own internal
limits and they never really fuck with
your systemic fatigue it's never a
limiting factor
now at some point as an immediate you'll
probably run into the idea that you
can't actually train everything as hard
as possible and get the best gains
then you meet me put like one or two
muscles on the back uh you know for
a few messed cycles and then you know
put them back in take another two
muscles out eventually go to something
like a 50 50 split
like you're doing their eduardo which is
totally fine you might not have to do
that but if you have to do that the way
you would know is
is your systemic um you know
fatigue what's limiting you if it's not
then you can add more muscle groups to
do um
if it is then then you can't do as many
muscle groups as you think
and a lot of times the big muscle groups
are the ones that really impose so like
you can do like tons of forearms or
biceps and
rear delts and that's totally fine but
if you do like a super
quad and back emphasis and the same
mesocycle it might just not work out for
you so that's really the answer there
yeah that was a really thorough answer
so eduardo something like a very simple
approach the first couple times you do
specialization
you might just do something really
simple like upper body
versus or lower body emphasis right so
you're kind of just hitting
all the stuff up here or all the stuff
down below and go from there and see how
that goes
and you might find that you might be
able to make great gains in quite a few
areas all across the board
for a while and you're like wow this is
great and eventually you might have to
start dwindling that down
and so kind of your phase two might be
instead of saying upper
like a whole upper focus you might say
like chest and arms focus and go with
that for a while and see how that goes
and that might go for really good maybe
you do the same kind of thing like maybe
you did
uh you know like a quad and calf focus
on a different one or maybe you did like
a back and by
any of those kind of things are totally
fine and at some point your
that will start to slow down too right
this is probably on the scale of years
at this point
and then you might find that you might
actually have to start taking things uh
down to like mv levels when you do your
specialization phases so
i would say start big see it go as big
as you can before systemic fatigue
becomes a limiting factor and all the
things that dr mike said
and then kind of start narrowing your
focus down because i think a lot of
people start specializing
way too narrow way too early where
they're like i'm going to do arms and
shoulders
it's like you you can do that but you
could also have been training back like
that entire time and making great back
gains as well like there's so there's no
point in limiting it to such small
muscle groups in such limited context so
start big and kind of dwindle down based
on your responses as you go
100 next up is
zakaria
and he says how to work out weekly
volume for smaller muscle groups
such as rear delts and upper traps since
they recover so quickly
while i use pump and fatigue levels as
the muscle indicators you all same
indicators all the same ones
soreness might not be a big one because
a lot of those muscles that you
mentioned aren't really mechanically
positioned to get much muscle damage or
nearly as much as you would want
but generally speaking the pump
perception of tension etc and
performance
like if your performance is excellent
you're recovering super easily and your
pumps aren't super impressive you can
increase the volume
and then at some point the volume is
going to be so high that like
you're going to be doing multiple sets
when you've already peaked in a pump and
that's probably
not super productive and also you just
need to get really tired and you will be
able to hit pr's as readily
so you might think like oh like this is
a bit high in volume but still working
and at some point you get so fatigued
you can't do it anymore and that'll be
your maximum recoverable volume
uh an easy one there is um
make sure you train them frequently
because if you train those muscles
infrequently you could do like almost an
infinite amount of volume per session
right most of it ends up being junk
volume
and you never get tired because you heal
so much it's like how much volume would
you have to do to your quads
per session if you were in a position
where you only had to recover every
other week
but like there really is like 40 sets i
don't know but then like the last
15 of those sets the last 25 of them are
probably just total junk
so make sure that like if these small
muscle groups recover quickly you're
also
interspersing lots of frequency two to
four times a week per muscle i think is
a really good start
yeah that was a really good answer i was
going to go the frequency route too
simply because of eight like
dr mike already mentioned the junk
volume problem that you get from just
training those like twice per week which
is going to be mostly a waste for you
but even like three or four times per
week you might have such high interest
session volumes
that you might start to find that even
something as lame as like your traps and
your rear delts
start to interfere in weird ways with
other things like your back training
whereas if you did them four or five
times per week the session volumes are
relatively small you still get great
pumps and they have less spill over into
other things like
it's just it's gonna be one of those
irritating things where you did so many
like reverse pec decks
that now you can't actually do your
heavy rows as effectively like the next
day that would be like very irritating
right because you're like well
i followed all the algorithms and my i
kept getting like you know
pumps are my performance was good and
all this stuff things but i had to do
like 15
20 sets per session like that's the
problem with that so that's when having
a higher frequency really helps out and
you don't have to blast
so much either junk volume or just so
much in each session
next up niz michaels
smythe smith
question try to sneak into oh yes
question two we will just ignore
uh niz uh post that next week
um question i've been doing really well
in terms of my nutrition for the past
six months however i'm a fat fuck at
heart
regardless of how low or high my body
fat is
i really really enjoy engaging in pure
fat assory unrestricted eating around 6
to 12
calories per day i love food but i also
love being lean my question is how often
can i engage in this type of behavior
without getting a ton of body fat
rapidly
once a month more less never well since
it's really easy for you to find out
start with once a month and see how
every month you're how fat you are
if you're like ah this is fine go to two
times a month and after a month or two
you may be like man i'm a lot better
than i thought i
was getting this sucks and then you
could be like oh once a month it is
you could have a situation where you do
that
you know once a week and you have
plenty lean and not getting too fat it
also depends on what else you do with
the other calories throughout the week
so if you're okay with having a slightly
smaller surplus for the other days that
you're gaining or maintenance let's
say and you're slightly hypocaloric then
and then
then you have six to 12k calories every
saturday or something people make that
work all the time it's totally doable
it's just your weekly calories have to
be in balance it's up to you to make the
adjustments that being said
both for fat loss for maintenance it
doesn't apply as much
for fat loss and muscle gain dedicated
small surplus and deficit because
they're consistent work better than a
ton of pulsatility
especially for muscle gain i think if
you like are hypocaloric most of the
week
and you have six to 12 k calories on
saturday that's not the best way to gain
muscle and it is a pretty decent way of
getting fat
so some moderation is probably a good
idea there
um i also say that once you get big
enough
your love of unrestricted eating might
dwindle
because you're just like fuck all this
eating business so if you eat a lot of
really wholesome food plenty of fiber
lots of filling options you might be so
not hungry that
just one fun cheat meal that's only 2
000 calories
per day extra could do you write in
yeah i agree with dr mike here i also
would suggest maybe you think about like
kind of a phasic approach to these
things because like
obviously um multiple instances of these
kind of i want to say binge eating but
like
having these really unrestricted eating
days is going to be disastrous on a cut
so
when you're cutting and actively trying
to be lean you might say okay for the
next
three or four months when i'm cutting
i'm only going to do
once per month of this behavior
when you're massing it's still not a
great idea because you'll tend to get
fatter and just
maybe not be gaining as much calories on
the net on a weekly basis that you
should
but it's a little bit less detrimental
you say okay maybe i can squeeze in like
two times a month and it's not a huge
deal i think on maintenance phase is
when you can cut a little bit looser
and what i would say is when you are in
a maintenance phase maybe
you know dr mike might tidy this up for
me here but i would say
at least two weeks after a cut maybe
upwards of like a month after a cut
you might start incorporating those in a
little bit more frequently
to your heart's desire that way you
won't be as prone to like
super hard rebound weight gain so i'd
say maintenance is the time where you
have a little bit more freedom to cut
loose on that
aft assuming you've had some time after
like a cut phase is finished
maybe you might get away with three
times a month or something and it really
doesn't
seem to impact you that much uh and then
i would kind of like physically
i would try on error and then physically
approach it like that and say like okay
well this is the time of the year when
i'm actually trying to be lean so this
is this is not in line with my goals so
binge eating like this would be like a
specificity violation
whereas like at least on mass phase
still not great it's at least
more in line with what i'm trying to do
which is gain weight so that's okay
and then maintenance is more about like
just taking a break from the rigors of
hard diet and hard training and just
kind of resetting yourself so
that's a good time to incorporate that
absolutely
absolutely next up
snake sar that's a weird one
that sounds like uh oh he's got a batman
uh uh
avatar i am but snixar sounds like some
kind of
remember like who the fuck are those
people's names the um
the lion people i'm a lion oh remember
oh thundercats yeah undercats so that
little asshole from the thundercats that
was fucking useless and
he was in the fucking um all the time
snarf yes yeah
he's like oh it's powerful because
somebody just killed that thing
why was it about he was so funny he was
like
he had like a beard he was like supposed
to be like an old man but like
i don't know cologne chitara and get him
get
rid of everyone else should tower me up
before you go go
fine as hell snake
are stomach vacuums legit how do they
work if if they are effective and how
would you recommend to program them so
stomach vacuums have only really one
purpose and that's to practice
doing a vacuum for being like looking
cool in photos or on stage
they absolutely work because pretty much
any practice skill works it's a lot of
diaphragm
breathing control you're essentially
sucking you're positioning a diaphragm
such a way that it sucks out all the
uh the volume from your lungs and
actually you're using a couple of other
abdominal muscles to pull everything in
it's totally legit um a program i will
probably practice vacuums
every other day or every day um and
youtube and google has many techniques
because there's tons of like great tips
people have how to hit a vacuum how to
hold a vacuum is hitting it's not that
hard holding it's fucking tough
you have to you have to breathe in a
completely different way like without
moving your diaphragm a whole lot
um it's tough so google all that shit
incorporate all the techniques
practice often often so what you don't
need to do is practice vacuums for like
an
hour that's fucking stupid practice
vacuums for like five to ten minutes a
day
you could hit like 20 vacuums in that
time from different positions and
different poses
and focus on what you're doing a little
wrong what you could get better and
focus on holding it a little longer each
time maybe a little deeper
um practice them a lot as you get leaner
because as you get leaner your vacuum
gets better and better you can
really suck it in and see all the
principles at work and also that's
specific because
you don't need to be good at vacuums
when you're a fat piece of shit because
you can't do one and nobody gives a
flying fuck
but when you're practicing vacuums more
and more and more as the show approaches
as you're getting leaner and by the time
you step on stage your baller with the
vacuums and you can show often
all of your friends clap and that girl
that used to not give you any attention
she claps too but like she really claps
like
she's really putting her hands together
she's like this she's like oh my god
oh my god you did it you did it you're
gonna do it later
yeah and so like uh kind of talking
about what dr mike was saying i would
approach that more as a skill training
rather than like physical training or
fitness training right in this case
you're learning how to move
and orient yourself in a certain way
just like as if you were practicing like
a back double bye or side you know chest
or any of those other bodybuilding
movements that you wanted to practice
those are essentially skills and then
skills can then be integrated into like
the quote unquote tactics of a
bodybuilding routine
and go from there so in that case as
mike said like smaller more frequent
exposures would be to your benefit
rather than like trying to hit like a
vacuum mrv in in a week or a session or
something like that
yeah five percent all right
antoine barzan
god i wish he was we've only frenchified
his name i wish it was french
yeah but i don't maybe it is
maybe i don't know he says hi thanks a
lot for answering my question sorry for
the question mark i didn't see that one
um what do you think would be the best
investment after a barbell
uh and dumbbells uh for a home gym if
one cares mostly about hypertrophy
without long-term joint health
my answer is going to be a stupid one
which you probably don't want to hear
but it has there's this general less
stupid one that can be positive in his
place
uh the free motion cable machine which
is not cheap
that it does like 10 trillion things you
can do shoulders biceps forearms
all kinds of back uh it's amazing but
it's fucking not cheap
and it's a little large um my second
answer would be any kind of the
generally variable cable setup where you
can do at least pull downs
cable rows cable curls and upright rows
and
cable tricep push-downs and i mean that
basically is an awesome
machine because you could buy a bunch of
different handles for it handles the
cheap as fuck they're like 20
each and that literally turns into a
bunch of different machines it's a
really worthwhile investment so free
motion is the best
machine for that but a regular cable
setup
is awesome and james i suspect you agree
with me because you only have barbells
dumbbells and
that machine the cable machine i just
described yeah and actually i
so yeah i totally agree with dr mike
here and getting the um
so for me i got like the cable
attachment that fit into the squat rack
that i own so they made like a
supplemental cable thing that you just
bolt into your squat rack
and that thing was a game changer in
terms of what i could do at home because
for years for the last i don't know
three or so years i had only been doing
barbell and dumbbell stuff and you can
imagine
why i always bitch about having elbow
tendinitis because you can only do so
many things right and so for that one
even just for a fatigue management
standpoint being able to do some like
cable curls and some pull downs and
some upright rows with the cable instead
of just blasting my fucking elbows all
the time
made a huge quality of life improvement
for me and
on side note as you probably have
already guessed also increased the sfrs
for a lot of the movements i was using
so for example
like your boy has long arms and i'm
heavy pull-ups
not a great movement for me i usually
have to do an assisted and i really
don't get much out of assisted pull-ups
just because like
i usually shit out around like 10 or so
now i can do pull-downs
and i can do you know upwards of 20 and
that gets me going like
nothing else for my back training so not
only does it help you in the fatigue
management side it can help you heavily
in the sfr side
i would not spend so mel and i always
have this kind of
i don't want to say argument we go back
and forth about what things we want to
add to our home gym
and i'm sure most of you can relate so
price is always an issue
and then of course the footprint and
utility of whatever you get so mel will
be like
i really want a 45 degree back raise i
fucking love 45 degree back race the
only downside is
it's fucking enormous and you could only
do 45 degree back raise
right so that's kind of a bummer and so
i'm trying to see if i can get her on
the
the belt squat wagon because the belt
squat you can do squats you can do
lunges you can actually do upper body
stuff
you can do hip hinges you can do all
sorts of wacky shit with the belt squat
it has a massive footprint but at least
has more utility in some ways so
that's another thing you kind of figure
is like the cost and then the footprint
versus how much
how many things you can do with it can't
beat the cable stuff as mike already
said though cable stuff yeah
another example of a shitty machine to
get if you just have barbells and
dumbbells is a smith machine dude you
guys know i love the smith machine
but it just replicates all the other
movements right it just gives you a
little bit of variation and it's all the
same shit
so like and you can't even put different
attachments on it so like
how what's more different you know a
cable movement or a barbell movement
or barbell movement and a smith machine
bottle movement fuck man
so a lot of people get like there's a
lot of redundant machines like
it's really funny too because like um
you know like we all bitch
about like public gyms we go to james no
longer he doesn't go to a public gym
but like sometimes you gotta wonder like
what the fuck the people shoes like
choosing the the people whose job is to
choose equipment to buy or thinking
like you'll have like two leg presses
and zero hack squats
and the next purchase will be just an
addition of like a different leg press
like a different brand where the fuck is
the hack squat you could have just
you could have added to this gym like
exponentially
but you just did like this marginal
addition of like oh great this other
life and half the time it that light
press is even
worse and you're just like who makes
these stupid
fucking decisions but such as life the
funny thing that that
you mentioned the smith machine example
the funny thing with that one is it's
like it does the same things as barbell
does but has more upkeep than the
barbells because you've got to like
grease it make sure it's balanced like
all that other shit so it's like it's
even more fuss than just having a
barbell
fucking yeah first big of a fan of emma
smith machine it's not a
not a standard home gym piece of
equipment so like sorry real quick one
uh when i was
when i was working as a manager at the
gym at um university of illinois chicago
uh
we had a smith machine there but it
would one of the things that sucked is
that it would always get off balance and
you'd always have to have somebody come
in and like oh shit
he balanced it so it would always even
though it's a smith machine
you'd unrack it and you could feel that
it would be leaning on one side of
machines like that before i'm like this
is useless
yeah and your legs not work signing this
god damn it it's
it's supposed to be square it's the
whole point of this machine is that it
can't be off kilter right
and they do you have to get them tuned
up james i used a smith machine
in which the properly functioning
version of that brand
doesn't balance side to side
and i'm just like why exactly it
literally has only one function
is to keep the barbell going forward or
backward that's it that it does well
but this it doesn't prevent i'm just
like
oh my god i lost 80 pounds of strength
on my smith machine shoulder press wow
imagine i'm wrecking it being like what
no that's literally what i did what the
fuck is going on
and i was like is this broken am i using
a wrong oh this is how it was designed i
just
that's like i want to come up to the
engineer that made that thing and just
head about the fuck out of them
unacceptable unacceptable who tested
this
let me guess somebody somebody gave this
a check mark and was like yeah this is
good
fine it looks like a machine uh all
right next up
every small airy
it's airy and it's small he says hi
ducks
hairy and small oh that's what's up damn
james you really just threw yourself
into the woods self-deprecating
that's great no one can deprecate you if
you delegate yourself
um dude there's a couple instagram
accounts now
with like like hater accounts for me one
is like
the caption at the like the description
is like fuck mike israel guy makes like
these videos where he voices over my uh
like some of these youtube videos that
i've made and he's like i'm an
idiot and i'm dumb and i'm just so
mature interesting investment of your
time
you know that's like reps and reserve
guy got his friend he doesn't sound
german to do it so it can't come back to
him
100 that see that's brilliant because we
all know reps and reserve guys german as
shit
like just admit it you hate yawn freeze
that's the whole purpose of the account
is to make fun of them
and it's not clear you lift weights and
it's pretty clear john freeze does
so it's a cringe city
anyway every small says in regards to
genetic engineering how far away do you
think we are from being able to change
your gen x
to be optimal for bodybuilding do you
think this will be a good thing or bad
for bodybuilding so i have a two-part
answer for you
number one determinant of how far we are
away from that unfortunately is the
state of the regulatory environment in
most countries that have
the capacities to engage in advanced
biomedical research
unfortunately most countries have that
uh have
uh been sort of infiltrated by a culture
of bioethics which doesn't understand
bioethics
and thus the approval and regulatory
burden is massive
so a lot of genetic engineering research
doesn't even happen because you have to
be a multi-billion dollar company to
afford the potential lawsuits and also
the crazy shit
to have to jump through the regulatory
hoops so i don't foresee it coming along
until maybe fuck ten years from now i
don't see it coming in five to ten
hopefully i'm wrong
maybe ten years from now we'll have some
mild advances uh if
the regulatory state moved the fuck out
of the way in large part within five
years we'd have revolutionary genomic
therapies
for all kinds of things but it's not the
way the state of the world is
um and then do you think this would be a
good thing or bad thing for me it's a
phenomenal thing for bodybuilding
i actually don't understand how could be
a bad thing at all
for example steroids and growth hormone
made bodybuilding better
because it made people more jacked and
leaner which is the whole point of
bodybuilding
so genetic engineering will uh reduce
the effect of genetics on
outcome which is also kind of cool
because there's not really a thing of
being gifted anymore
you can just change your genetics to
more gifted and people look more like
what they want
which is the ultimate purpose of
bodybuilding is to look cool and it'll
make looking cool
much more straightforward so i think
it'll be an amazing thing as for
competitive bodybuilding
um first who gives a shit and second of
all i would love to be in a world where
everyone looks so good competitive
bodybuilding has no meaning
that would be the ultimate victory yeah
the cool thing with like genetic
modification it was it would reduce the
amount of like risk taking behavior such
as having to take large amounts of gear
to get the physique that you want right
so you'd have to kind of eliminate some
of the the taboo and the negative around
it
i personally think we're going to get to
more of like the cybernetic type
interventions first before we actually
get to a lot of those like
because that's not regulated yeah well
yeah and i think like i think once that
happens people won't even
i think like the whole notion of like
genetic modification for like sport
more or less will just be kind of moot
because it's like yeah i could go
through like extensive gene therapy or i
could just get fucking robo legs and go
from there
now i can jump and sprint as fast hi and
just do all the shit that i want to do
like so at that point it just becomes
like i said you're just like yeah
i always i'm always fascinated with
folks that i'm not saying here that
you're
committing this fallacy but i'm always
fascinated with a certain
perseverative view of like all the
hollis effect sports
like there's real world shit way more
important sports
like people can walk again because
that's coming from sports scientists
right like right
like we love sports yeah but we
understand it's like i can entertain
it's literally an entertainment industry
like can you imagine like you finally
engineer like
pure like completely you can't tell
apart like virtual reality
and sufficiently strong ai they're like
no fucking just virtual reality you can
like plug into
a headset or whatever it feeds into your
whole body you can sense everything
like you imagine the porn industry or
the fucking the sex worker industry
being like we're all out of jobs now
it's like no fucking shit and people are
getting laid with whoever they want
whatever they want is completely safe
no stds no abuse nothing we solve the
princess solve problem go away
get another job as a matter of fact you
could still have sex work a job and now
you can wear a different shell inside a
virtual world
isn't that great like it's so funny
there's always groups like
there's always enemies of progress
because what about this and that like
well you know that's nice go away
go away we're solving your problems like
if if people who have their legs severed
in accidents
now run faster than regular people
because they have advanced bionic legs
it's time to cry tears of joy not to be
like what happened to olympic sprinting
you wanna do olympic sprinting
enjoy fucking run as fast as you want
i'm gonna take my fucking robotic legs
thank you very much
yeah and who knows where it goes i mean
it might be one of those things where um
it opens up new avenues for sports that
we just can't even comprehend at the
moment
you know just sweet that'd be sweet
pandora's box
i'm just you pandora sounds like a fine
ass bitch i'm looking up baby let me see
that box ooh that's sexual harassment
box has a different connotation um all
right
alina asks
got it hey docs today during my training
session a very practical question came
to my mind
targeting certain rir let's say lateral
raise at 1rar
come up with a rep goal based on my
previous lifts let's say i shoot for 10
reps at 1rar and lateral raises
4 sets which is what i did today the
following thing happens on the first set
i can exceed the target
but i already know it will drastically
decrease the number of reps i can do in
the following sense
so i could either decide to always have
one rer which would mean set one twelve
reps set
uh second set eight reps third seven
four seven
or decide to focus on ten reps uh set
one ten reps three rar set two
ten reps one rar set the third set ten
reps one array r and fourth
set ten reps one or zero ir so is it
better to focus on the
reps uh or the rar i have very
conflicting thoughts on this
number one rar means effort so the first
set
could be junk volume when just
hitting ten and three rar so to answer
that question right now it's not junk
volume 3r as well within the hypertrophy
window so you're fine uh number two but
more or less constant reps allow me to
better prepare
compare my performance and see if that
has improved that's false
because all you need to do is average
those reps week to week to week the
averages
are what constitute performance so if
it's 12 11 9
8 it's just as easy to compare those as
10 10 10 10
because you just average them like
literally combine them you get an
average rep number if you beat it last
week then you're fucking golden
and when you have the variable rir it's
harder to know like what what accounted
for any differences that did occur
totally yeah like maybe i just wasn't
pushing it hard enough for too hard uh
and then number three
still more weight at more total amount
of reps is not
unimportant either uh it is that
important for so far
performance because you could just do
more sets and get there that way but
that doesn't mean you're getting
stronger
number four but then i come back to rer
which is essentially what defines
effective reps that's certainly a
component
uh someone helped thank you so much so
six people helped
but uh we're not gonna read those
responses i'm sure they're very good um
oh james is
jay leno responded oh that's nice he's
such a busy man
and it's glad i'm glad he can get
between his car collection
and his tv appearances so the way james
and i obviate these things
is generally speaking we do one of two
things one
is usually we do the method where every
set
independently has the same target rirs
three or every time
if you get tired you should stop at
three r stop at one ri r and you just
get a different amount of number of reps
and then next week it's easy to compare
so i got nine reps last time at two hour
or maybe this time i'll shoot for ten
reps at one arm it makes a lot of sense
or you know extra five pounds on the bar
you could also do um sometimes james and
i will train for slightly lower ups like
sets of six
sets of eight and then you just do like
three by eight or four by eight in leg
press or hack squat or something
and and then you just kind of do like a
average session
rir we're like yeah it's gonna be like
an rf2
would be like a three on the first set
two on the second set and a one on the
last set and that's totally fine
that's a little it comes with its own
complexities but
it also solves the complexities of
having to guess the rr every time you're
like a three by eight
super easy i just fucking hit it and you
think back like was that really two hour
on average
yeah it's probably one one and a half so
maybe next time they can only have like
two and a half pounds
instead of five pounds like i was
planning either method works just be
consistent
at the end of the day the best method to
be more technically precise
is every set gets treated as its own but
if you don't want to do that if it
clouds your
your judgment then just do averages and
do straight steps it's totally fine too
you know i don't know about you dr mike
but i feel like um i don't want to be
thinking about that shit when i start my
session like when i start my session i
have my log
or whatever i did you know last time
assuming i've been going for a minute
or two and i just want to go in there
and go okay i know today's two r that's
it i don't want to think about like
changing my effort
per set on each every little exercise or
activity that i'm doing in my session
so for me it just streams lines the
whole price like that is more
streamlined than saying
get 10 reps because getting 10 reps each
time is complicated and
you have to kind of guesstimate where to
stop on each set
uh and then or sorry retroactively guess
what rir you stopped at each set whereas
if you just say like i'm going to r
today i know what 2rir means i don't
have to think about it all i got to do
is
follow the set progression algorithms
all of those things and then that's it
then you're just up and running
yep and also if you and that's just the
first week
if you have a second third of whatever
week you have numbers to match or beat
okay i got 12 last time
look i'm not going to get 11 this time
like i'm going to get 12 or 13 and i'm
going to add two and a half or five
pounds on the bar
if you hit that you don't have to worry
about what our
really was because you're just gonna hit
more and more and more later the only
time you have to worry is like oh fuck i
can't hit this or like oh it took
way too much energy to hit this for sure
not three ir like it was supposed to be
it was like zero
then you can make an adjustment but we
like to make adjustments after the shit
happens
not before the shit happens because you
really don't know how set is going to go
until you do it at the end of the day
like some people one of the worst things
i've ever i've seen out of the worst
things this is
wild exaggeration to begin a point let
me erase my last comments and say
a little pet peeve of mine is when
people make calls i'm deloading and
reducing volume before even trying like
a potentiation
set they'll do like a they'll say
they're squatting 405 for sets of five
that day
or they're supposed to and they do 225
and they're like fuck this dude
load i'm fucked up it's like are you
sure and then i just don't
like of course if something hurts or
something like i said i don't feel like
i haven't like
why don't you try 15 for a double a lot
of times 15 for a double like
it actually feels a little better try
405 for a single and they're like dude
that didn't feel that bad
they hit 405 for five and fucking blow
their old pr of the water you're like
see
a lot of times now in the days i felt
the worst
are the days i performed the best you
just don't know now if your workout is
like you do your first work set and you
just shit the bed
right abandon ship deload but give it a
shot
yeah and like sometimes i think people
are are reluctant to do the constant rir
because they see their reps dropping
but the good news is and as we kind of
beat this to death in the hypertrophy
book
as long as you're within the effective
rep range which is by proxy effective
loading range for hypertrophy which is
between like 5 and 30 reps like
dude you're good and even if you say you
were doing lateral raises and you're
like dude i'm doing lateral raises for
like sets of five
you can do down sets like you can just
pick a lighter weight and get those reps
back up again like that's an easy
problem to solve so don't worry about
the reps dropping down
yeah 100 but then people say like but
i'm using less weight like well
something has to give you're fucking
tired
yeah yeah and as long as you're in those
effective loading ranges like you're
good to go
yeah all right henrik anderson's
last question for the day consistent yes
very
uh hello docs it's that time of the week
again my weekly question
have you ever participated in a debate
roundtable or podcast where the
opposition
slash other participants have changed
your opinion on something
if so what was it
i i could think of one actually and this
wasn't really a debate it was more of
just a round table
um so i think just coming from
my background you know we were we're
really have sport science is very
heavily focused on pre-planning things
like
setting an annual plan making sure that
people are doing these things in like a
very regulated manner
um and i remember i believe we were at
jps in australia
and i heard meno talking about basically
like auto regulating
everything and i remember thinking like
man not super big on that and then the
more i heard him talk i was like you
know actually
this makes a lot of sense like there's
no point in sticking to like the
pre-planned
dogma like just that's just cause that's
just my background it's just my bias
what i'm used to
but it makes sense on an
individualization level to auto regulate
as much things if not everything as you
can and then you can
you have the epiphany of like what he's
saying makes a lot of sense and then you
have the epiphany of like
oh actually both things make sense why
not just do both like why not just do
both
like there's no reason you can't
actually pre-plan and auto regulate at
the same time
and that was definitely one where i
remember thinking like man this auto
regulation stuff and then i heard mano
talking i was like oh yeah no he makes
some really good points
yeah my story is also involving meadow
and one of them
it's uh i actually listened to a podcast
i guess this doesn't count but
um of meno and a couple other folks and
eric helms debating diet breaks
and meadow had a really good argument
against using diet breaks and refeeds
uh and it really posed some excellent
questions and that actually changed my
views
i used to be sort of more pro diet
breaking refeed and then i heard meno
get to it and i was like god damn
didn't make it a real convincing case
that just like once the diet starts just
get in and finish and get out
uh now of course there's some nuance
there but that was really good and then
another one was when um
we were on the original like chef
nippers hypertrophy round table
uh eric helms made the point that
uh maybe you don't have to try to
squeeze well close to mrv all the time
and that training close to minimum
effective volume
is a good idea and i that changed my
thinking considerably and put a kernel
into my head that eventually
led to the development of all of the
volume landmarks and the mav mae
and mrv uh since then i eric and i have
had some disagreements
uh about training at mev i seem to think
it's a good idea
i don't really can't really tell what he
thinks about it but i'm sure his opinion
is is no doubt
quite advanced sometimes i think he he
likes to debate for the for the sake of
debating because i've heard him give
talks i've heard him give talks which
more or less say like and
in so many words i'm just paraphrasing
but like hey when you're doing a show
prep
it's probably not a bad idea to train at
mev like because you can survive
longer and you can it's easier to auto
regulate you know i've heard him say
things like that
and again i'm paraphrasing i'm sure he
had more eloquent points to make there
but so i think sometimes he just is like
just flexing a little bit you know what
i mean sure he likes to be a stickler or
especially for terms and citations and
stuff which is good
yeah that's a very big critical thing
like if i didn't have to
justify myself to people in new
citations i would just say all kinds of
loony bin shit all the time
trust me i'm right i'm really smart so
uh yeah that's definitely uh
a stuffy thing and funny enough like um
just just while we're
wagging the tail a bit i uh i i follow
greg knuckles and eric trexler a lot and
i just very rarely debate any of them
i did have a debate with eric traxler
but we both sort of brought a lot of
stuff to the equation and ended up
mostly agreeing
on p ratios um but i always follow those
guys and a number of other people
menno is probably my favorite to follow
because like
i just learned a ton from those guys um
if you don't follow me
on someone's you really should if you go
on this here's a cool gem you
follow manhattan someone's on instagram
don't bother messaging him because he
doesn't even run his own instagrams
don't ask me questions
just go into his stories like you know
like they have the featured stories you
can like save for forever
go in there there's like 52 weeks of
stories
each one of them like links to a sweet
blurb or
a study write-up it's unbelievable
you'll never get through them all
because you just start reading
and learning a ton so go seek out meadow
seek out greg knuckles eric traxler
crowns all those guys
we all learn from each other uh so it's
really good to consume all your other
shit
um there's plenty of like retarded
people on youtube you can't possibly
learn from so it's good that there's
some people you can
i guess yeah for sure and i think like
especially since we all have similar
educational backgrounds we um
although it may seem like we are
debating each other or or
not in agreement on something when you
actually look at the context of what
we're talking about it's usually
just like some piddly thing that's it's
like you have like ninety percent
overlap of
agreement and then like maybe five to
ten percent disagreement on something
that is so minut and
maybe not even able to be proven yet so
it's like some people will say like oh
you you don't agree with eric helms on
this and i'm sure dr mike has said
countless times like actually i do we
just had this like one thing we didn't
quite see eye to eye on and
that was it let me get every time i
don't agree with eric helms on something
it's because i think he's stupid and
worthless
that's i just want people to know that
so stop asking me to think of eric helms
i fucking hate the guy
both ways it goes both ways he's a great
guy he's
he's one he's such a great person like
as a human being that i feel like a
scumbag criminal any time i'm around him
i feel like i have like shame
just being around eric helms because he
looks and talks just like captain
america
i like i remember like talking smack
about like somebody to him like some
liberal piece of shit in the industry
and eric's like you know mike i'm really
trying to get away from talking smack
and i'm like no
jesus christ has that uh
asshole fucking tom cruise-esque
feature like he walks into the room and
everyone's like oh eric house and you're
like
hey i'm dr james do do do tell you i
hope this i hope someone means this but
if i was a woman
and eric was willing by god there'd be
nothing stopping me
that's willing damn
that's how it is well on that note james
hoffman as well
hey james hey i think that's a good note
to end up do we get all the questions it
would have been a sweet note before
even right before any of this um no more
questions that's it that's
all we got this week as far as the top
ten okay so just a couple little
housekeeping things if you guys haven't
noticed we've switched to a
bi-weekly format so we're coming at you
every other week hopefully you guys got
the memo the last time
let's see so i was working on the
hypertrophy book audio book i
finished that we did dr mel's uh habit
excuse me evidence-based habit building
uh book we did the recording for that
mel also uh did some extras where she
walks you through some worksheets and
then i did a q a with mel at the end
which i thought was fun
uh what else hypertrophy book is on
paperback now and that's available
so um yeah that's all i got dr mike what
you got anything
we're always on the youtube grind always
more youtube
and um oh fuck
oh we have completed the
updated hypertrophy individual muscle
training guides
in the hypertrophy guide central hub you
can find that if you go to my instagram
and go to my bio
just click the link and it takes you
right to all that shit uh if you
want to know about how to train the
hamstrings or the side delts or one of
the exercises one of those splits one of
the periodization
the shit is all there if you have the
scientific principles of hypertrophy
book uh and you're like you've read it
you're like oh my god this theory is
amazing i love it i sort of know what
i'm doing
then you want the practical shit of how
to train every muscle group and you
really want to be able to understand it
go to those guides oh they're free by
the way each one's like 15 pages long
for every single major muscle group so
get in there get working on those
forearms
mm-hmm i actually have had two clients
two male clients
recently who started a mass program and
i put them on like a forearm routine
which normally i wouldn't
