hey folks
squat mistakes that are super common and
how to fix them
who better to teach us than charlie jung
my friend and training partner
at charlton banks on instagram follow
him if you like
gigantic koreans
our first mistake is not doing enough
range of motion it may be the most
common mistake
in squatting all around the world in
gyms everywhere some folks will squat
like this
but they'll do a squat go ahead and hit
it charlie and you know they'll decide
at some arbitrary point
is good enough because to quote our
friend michael zandelovich what is down
there in a deep squat that i want to
know so much
so badly here's the thing hypertrophy's
down there
stretching the quads helps them grow
going through a full range of motion not
only grows the quads but the glutes
and adductors so on and so forth and you
can use less load
everything good comes from squatting
super deep
we'll talk about in the next mistake
what two deep is but for now
one of the biggest fixes to this is
literally just a determination to go low
a lot of people everything's fine with
their stance
everything's fine with their mechanics
they're just arbitrarily caught in depth
so charlie stop arbitrarily cutting
depth
and go ahead and squat to a nice depth
boom that's it now all of a sudden he's
going low we didn't even have to make
any adjustments we'll get to the
adjustments in the next tip
in our quest to go super deep and
sometimes not even
we encounter a big mistake which is
rounding the lower back
being super lardonic or bent over in the
lower back
probably doesn't do anything good for
injury risk but a lot of times one of
the even worst possibilities
is that it reduces your ability to
produce force through the quads the back
becomes a living factor
which is not super good so charlie go
ahead and give us a deep squat but
really round over at the bottom like
some folks do
yay super rounded over that's not
awesome for both of the reasons that i
just said
how do we fix this a lot of times what's
required is not getting into super
anterior pelvic tilt like i like to do
with my squats which is fine by the way
you don't have to do this
but you should at least have your spine
relatively straight brace nice and tight
keep your chest not necessarily super up
but don't let it cave
forward again it's just a matter of
knowing these are the priorities
remember
at the bottom of a deep squat gravity
and body mechanics
want you to fold over on yourself just
don't do it resist by maintaining
upright posture charlie give us
a hint of what that looks like so
instead of rounding he's going to have
his chest up
he's going to have his back either
neutral or in a slight
lordosis and everything is super good
just like that
in our quest try to go low and hit the
quads sometimes we can have this other
mistake happen
which is the heels coming up off the
ground why is that bad it's dangerous
because it makes you wildly unstable and
if you've got plenty of weight on
yourself you don't want to be super
unstable
also because of that instability it
usually makes your central nervous
system
reduce the amount of force output to the
actual legs and the quads themselves
so if you go on your tippy-toes at the
bottom of a squat not only you're
enhancing injury risk you're actually
reducing the effectiveness of the
exercise
charlie give us a demo of what that
looks like trying to go low
and you end up going on your tippy toes
so yeah and then
oop and it always looks exactly as bad
as it is you ever seen this in the gym
it's weird
okay how do you fix it well an
interesting cue to use
is remember we don't want to do a super
equip power lifting squat we sit back
much more than we sit down
but maybe pushing your hips back while
unlocking your knees
instead of just unlocking your knees and
going down is a good cue to use here so
when you think of squatting
think of going a little bit back and
then plenty down and think of
actively staying on your whole foot
heels and toes
instead of just thinking i have to go
down and it's
gonna result in going forward so charlie
go ahead and tilt back a little bit like
usual
sits back and down everything's really
good a lot of times
another fix to this is pausing at the
bottom of a squat
so charlie go ahead and get on your toes
a little bit for us and then sit down to
the bottom of the squat and pause
okay and then i'll just tell him if i'm
his coach okay now settle into a
comfortable seating position
boom and automatically he goes down now
if his back is tight
we just fix the problem go ahead and
come up charlie so a big solution to
this potentially
if you're working with clients or even
yourself is if they go on their toes all
the time
have them pause at the bottom and tell
them we're going to pause and i want you
to get on your heels when we pause
every time they might start weird
they're going to fix it and sit on their
heels and eventually
they're going to pause everything is
going to look super good you can move
away from pauses if you like
and get back to normal regular squatting
the next mistake is squatting too low
what the hell
i thought acid grass was the way to go
brother well check this out brother
if we cannot possibly do the hip
structure
flexibility or what have you maintain
good positioning
all the way to super extra credit bottom
there's no reason to do it
it turns out that range of motion you
get partial credit for every bit of
range of motion you do
if you're doing a nice solid squat
that's below parallel
man you're doing a great job you don't
have to sink it in now sinking in has
great advantages
only if you can do it safely and
properly so charlie might have an
excellent squat to just below parallel
right so go ahead and show off what that
looks like i mean look that's a good
squat
is he going all the way down ass to
grass no but it looks fine spinal
position is fine
notice he's on his heels and toes he
might like watch a youtube video and say
i have to go all the way down our piece
of he goes all the way down
and where is that extra range of motion
coming from the lower back was stretched
around
and he's going on his toes now can we
fix those issues independently
sometimes a lot of times but if we can't
and there's just a point at which the
hips tilt
and you get on your toes because you
just lack the ankle mobility so on and
so forth
just go as low as you can before that
happens so you have
good good good squats eventually as you
squat
more and more and we'll talk about this
later but you might find a better foot
position
play with a bunch of stuff body position
you may and just out of sheer
flexibility increase eventually squat
lower and lower and lower
until you're squatting astra grass and
everything looks fine but you don't want
to rush that process
let it take its time
the next mistake is not bracing properly
especially when you're lifting a lot of
weight
if you brace wrong or you don't brace at
all it ends up making your core your
limiting factor
not allowing their legs to express their
strength as much
not taxing the quadriceps and other leg
muscles as much as they could be
and that prevents you from getting the
most out of the exercise so some people
have actually even seen this instructed
will say
this is it's funny to even say breathe
out
on the way down kind of ridiculous
charlie why don't you give that one a
try
lose all your air and then you collapse
into a black hole of death and suffering
you don't want that a good way to brace
for power lifting squats
is to make sure you take a huge breath
in
tighten your whole core make sure your
core is vertical not too lordic not too
kyphotic
and you don't want to have your chest
come up too much because that's a
leverage disadvantage but this isn't
powerlifting
and that much bracing takes a lot of
energy all you want to do
is make sure you breathe in tighten your
abdominal muscles just to some extent at
least
and stay nice and upright focusing on
keeping your core tight and focusing it
to make sure it's not wobbly so go ahead
and give us a look at what that looks
like charlie
breathe in squat up and breathe out
fundamentally you want to be breathing
in only at the top before you descend
and you want to breathe out towards the
last half of the movement
potentially or even just breathe out at
the very top
you don't want to be breathing in as you
go down and out from the very bottom
one thing that can happen if you reach a
grinder wrap charlie get to the bottom
and then start breathing out as you come
up and then your rep will slow down
because it's a grinder
oh he's out of air and now he's
collapsing right so breathe in
squat and towards the very top breathe
out
and do it again in bodybuilding this
minimal bracing allows you to be safe
effective and to get rep after rep after
rep
the opposite problem of that and this
happens a lot from folks transitioning
or concurrently competing in power
lifting
is over bracing folks these are
hypertrophy squats that means they're
done for reps of at least 5 to 10
sometimes 10 to 15 or even more you
don't want to brace so much
that the bracing is designed to protect
you and maximize
efficacy at 70 or 90
plus loads but there's no purpose for
doing that it actually literally takes
systemic energy
away from stimulating your quads you
don't want to spend a ton of time at the
top of each
bracing charlie show us a super brace
for every single different squat so
first brace go ahead and hit it overdue
the out of it boom he's locked in
yeah buddy
all right all right you got it you got
it and come up
yeah all right rebrace okay hit it again
yep
stomach down and all that other stuff
cool yeah he's gonna do
like three or four reps good enough he's
gonna do three or four ups really well
like that
that is not a way to have the quads be
the limiting factor
your whole body's gonna run out of
energy before you get to it so show us
the right way just to breath
in tighten and go so he's gonna breathe
in
tighten up come back breathe in again
tighten up come back no big deal over
bracing looks cool as
everyone thinks you know what you're
doing but you're really just pissing
away energy training your transverse
abdominis and not your quads
the next mistake is an uncontrolled
eccentric charlie show us what that
looks like really quick
boink and you come up and you fall down
what is that called die bombing your
squats
yep good enough for now that scares me
just looking at it is there a huge risk
of injury
from dive bombing your squats no not
really your body's actually quite sturdy
but it's a little bigger than we want
especially as the weight gets really
high
but there's a really legit risk of
something much worse than injury
not growing as much muscle as possible
per rep remember the eccentric phase
of muscle contraction the lengthening
phase is very hypertrophic and is very
necessary
you are not here to just get reps you
are here to tax the musculature and reps
or just a measurement
so when we do reps in the squat we don't
have to go four seconds or five seconds
down
if you want that's a cool variation we
don't even have to pause at the bottom
if you want that's a cool variation but
we want to control
the way down show us what a basic
minimum of control looks like charlie
controlled and then up notice he
controls the entire time on the way down
and up perfect that means we're staying
safe and our quads are active during the
lengthening
which means they're contracting
eccentrically which is awesome for more
muscle growth
the next mistake is not having a
standardized repetition depth
or cadence to your squats sometimes you
go super low
sometimes you don't and it's kind of
like by feel every single rep
 what do you feel in every
single rep you should have a rep
standard
that works really well for you and you
check every single box
now here's the deal if you're one of
those folks like we talked about earlier
who just goes below parallel that's
totally good but you gotta hit below
parallel every single time here's what
you don't want to do
go ahead and charlie show us a
 so you know we're doing
squats right
that was something cool maybe he'll do
it again jk he did a full squat that
time maybe he'll do a full squat again
ah no something felt off right good
enough
what we want is for every squat to look
essentially
very very similar not identical but you
should at least be trying
to go to objective landmarks charlie
knows when a squat
is full because he's a full-depth
squatter so he just squats until his ass
touches his calves
charlie hit it all the way down
you can't go any further than that now
if you or someone
who squats the just below parallel
charlie show us what a standardized
below parallel squat looks like
he might squat like this yep and he
comes up and notice his neck squat is
going to be exactly the same
and comes up and look if you need
someone to tell you when you're low
enough
that's fine hold yourself to a standard
this both allows you to get as much
muscle growth out of every rep as you
can
and allows you to standardize your
performance you know when you're getting
stronger on the squat
you know when your muscles are getting
bigger because you're getting stronger
for reps and you know when you haven't
or have
hit your maximum recoverable volume
next mistake is doing low bar squatting
what the hell low bar is not a mistake
lower is an excellent way for folks that
are flexible enough
to be competitive and power lifting and
lift the most weight we are not here to
do that we are to enhance lower body
specifically quadricep hypertrophy
low bar leverage us actually to use a
bit more of our glutes
a bit more of our back a bit more of our
hamstrings as well as our quads
that means the stimulus to fatigue ratio
for the quads goes
down because we can use more weight and
more of our body
we don't use our glutes and hamstrings
enough really to stimulate that much
more or
back we just use it to lift more weight
that causes lots of systemic fatigue
it's now a much more fatiguing exercise
when it's low bar because you're using
more weight
you can't get as much of a stretch on
the quads at the bottom you end up
lifting more weight but getting less out
of the exercise that's terrible
what we want to do is high bar position
in almost all cases that means you can
stay more upright your quads are much
more limiting factor
and per the amount of fatigue cost we
pay we get the most stimulus
so here's what low bar looks like you
know low bar setup
doesn't matter where you put your hands
it's going to end up being basically
right on your rear delts underneath the
top meat of your traps
that's cool it might even feel good but
it's not the best for hypertrophy for i
perfectly want to move
down a little bit so that we have the
bar right on top of our upper traps in
this case charlie's ridiculous traps it
doesn't even touch the shoulders that is
a really good squat
that's the position you want to be to
get the most out of your hypertrophy
squat for your quads
this isn't so much a mistake but
something that might happen to you in
your squatting journey
what if the squat hurts your neck or
your shoulders to actually put the bar
on your back the thing is first of all
if it doesn't hurt a ton nut up you'll
get used to it if you're new to
squatting
and you're not super strong or super
muscular yet it's going to get better
and better and better so if you're just
a little bit uncomfortable
you'll be totally fine however for some
people
based on a variety of things where their
bones are positioned
some anatomical differences squatting
without some kind of protective
pad actually does hurt all the time it
prevents them from getting a good squat
some people say use the safety squat bar
that's a totally fine solution
also don't be afraid to use the squat
condom as i've heard it called
something to wrap around that's totally
fine eventually however
you're probably going to go traps maybe
not as big as charlie's maybe bigger
and he's got his own bar pad go ahead
and show us what that looks like
charlie's going to get under the bar
guess what guess why his spine isn't
even touching the bar because these
things what the are those
folks eventually you're going to get
jacked enough you need a bar pad
that if you happen to be in a special
situation
and you happen to be a person for whom
it's really debilitating pain
don't worry about what people say it's
okay to use the bar pad get out of the
gym
to try to pretend you're tough to other
people that comment on you those
people
use the bar pet if you like put it on
the squat but when you don't need it
anymore you can wean yourself off of it
you'll be more stable
and you'll be well on your way
next mistake is over obsessing or under
obsessing about
where to look where to put your hand and
where to put your eyes
here's the real deal there are two
no-nos of where to look and they all
essentially result in the same thing
one is to try to look straight down at
your own dick or whatever's down there
if you look straight down on the squat a
lot of times it just rounds you over
and worse it can put you off balance the
next place you don't want to look is
completely straight up vertical behind
you
what the is back there you want to
see so bad if you want to see it bad
enough rack the bar and turn the
around
again it's not a problem on a
theoretical level it's just going to
cause you to lose balance
here's the thing people say looking up
too much or down too much
is going to hurt your neck that's the
dumbest pile of i've
ever heard
where the is the force transduction
here force transduces below the neck
if you think that you could hurt your
neck looking up in the squat don't ever
go to new york city and look at
skyscrapers your dumb ass will hurt your
neck just looking up it's the same
amount of force
that being said looking up can throw you
off balance looking down so far ken
where should you look wherever is comfy
and you have balance charlie where do
you like to look
show us where you like to look right
there is fine some people like to look
at sort of something out on the bottom
of the floor a couple feet out from them
they look down like that
this is totally fine everything's cool
as long as you're not looking
super far down or super far up and your
balance is being thrown off
next mistake is going too wide or too
narrow
and that involves which way you point
your feet as well
here's the thing we have a really easy
checklist to find out if we're going too
wide or too narrow
can we get a relatively full range of
motion can we do without lower back
rounding or without our toes coming up
and do we feel the movement a ton in our
quads
as the limiting factor for example
charlie do a really wide stance squat
with your toes pointed out
charlie can actually get relatively deep
in this relatively safely go ahead and
sink it down for us yeah that looks just
fine but what he might do is after a set
or two of that
will say hey do you feel that in your
quads a lot he'd be like you know what i
feel it in my adductors a tongue thing
is we don't do squats for adductors
we can do sumo deadlifts for those funny
thing is we can even do sumo squats for
them but then it's not the
quad hypertrophy squat for bodybuilding
it's a sumo squat for adductors and
glutes
different video different exercise right
so if
you feel it a ton in your quads they're
the limiting factor
if your heels are on the ground and your
toes are on the ground and if your lower
back
is at least neutral and possibly arched
a little bit any width is totally fine
that means we can squat really sort of
narrow stance and
charlie show us what that looks like
right narrow stance squat's totally fine
and here's the deal if your knees feel
totally fine and your hips feel fine
you can even point your toes completely
forward
and you're 100 people say hey where
should i point my toes
there's an easy answer there or are you
getting full range of motion they say
they say yes
are you feeling it a ton of your quads
and not a ton everywhere else yes
does anything feel weird and a joint
perspective your ankles hurt
your knees hurt your hips hurt they'll
say no well then it's 100 fine
and remember a closed stance squat a
moderate stance squat and anything in
between is totally cool you can even
vary them as different movements
there is no dogma here as long as you
feel it a ton of your quads
you're not being limited by anything
else there's not a ton of joint pain
going on versus some other positions
and you're able to maintain a tight
lower back and go to depth
while your heels stay on the ground
that's it
next problem is too much forward lean in
a squat
too much lean by itself isn't a bad
thing but it can do is make
your posterior chain including your
lower back the limiting factor
and not your quads which means every
time you get to let's say
one rep in reserve which is a really
solid set it's not actually one weapon
reserve in your quads
it's one wrap and reserve in your
posterior chain but not exactly why we
showed up to squat we could have been
doing deadlifts
glute ham raises and a bunch of other
stuff so a lot of times
this can be a solved problem with just a
couple of corrections it occurs really
often
in people not like myself or charlie
that have really long femurs
and really short torsos okay a lot of
times they're not making the proper
adjustments so
charlie maybe somebody told him this is
how tom platt squats so should you
sit back and down go ahead and hit it
and he's trying to squat first quads
all of a sudden he's sitting real far
back he's not even getting a ton of
range of motion anymore
his back is rounding he's lean too far
forward his knees are too far back
not a good thing so the first thing you
want to do is abandon the idea
that knees passing over your toes is a
bad thing if
when you descend in a squat when you
begin the descent
if you break your hips first or you
break at your hips and knees at the same
time
and you don't break at your knees first
you're not going to experience any
deleterious effects on your knees
by letting them come in front of your
toes as long as you break at your hips
and knees at the same time or even your
hips first
if the knees cross over the toes later
that's absolutely fine
now that we've thrown that idea out even
this weird stance might work better for
charlie
when he actually allows his quads to go
forward so even with this weird stance
give it a shot let your knees travel
forward as they have to
i mean that's looking a lot better much
less forward lean probably more
for the quads here's the thing go ahead
and come up if you have a really short
torso on long femurs
you you can also shorten your apparent
lever arm
by instead of having a stance like this
having a wider stance
and letting your knees come far out this
can let you stay more upright
let you get a bigger depth let you get
more of a quad hit as long as your
adductor is not a limiting factor
this works super well so take a wider
stance charlie notice he's pointing his
toes out a little bit more
and go ahead and do a squat he's going
to keep nice and upright he's letting
his knees come forward
and all of a sudden that's a great squat
without too much forward lean
perfect experiment with what works for
you don't be afraid
to have your knees cross your toes and
don't be afraid to squat a little wider
maintain that upright posture and you
might find that you don't lean too much
and your quads get an
awesome hit
the next mistake is essentially doing a
couple of things that could prevent you
from feeling your squat in the quads a
ton
all right we're squatting in order to
train the quads so we don't want to do
anything
positionally to throw that off now
here's the thing
if charlie and this is a real big deal
if charlie decides he wants to squat as
much weight as
possible what he's going to do is
probably sit back a bit more
and down a bit less go ahead and show us
what that looks like
his knees aren't going to come forward a
ton and even at the bottom he's going to
be sitting pretty far
back oh sure that'll put the pounds on
the bar but unfortunately we're actually
moving away
from targeting our quads if you want to
really feel your quads
starting with a pause at the bottom is
really good break at the hips and knees
and then let most of the rest of the
bend come from your knees
sit into your quads just like if you're
extending your tricep
you don't want to take your tricep out
this way you want to let the elbow break
and you sit
into your tricep force all the tension
into it
same idea with the squat and the quads
go ahead and show us what that looks
like so he's gonna break
and then he's gonna sit straight down
into his quads
yes it will shift the center of pressure
in your feet a little bit forward
as long as your heels are down that's
still super good give us a paused
version for a second
you know how to do this right if you can
pause it and
literally let your knees slide forward
stay upright and after the pause you're
going to know
where the quads are best stimulated
another cool tool to use
is a bit of a slower eccentric you don't
have to show it off if you can slow down
your eccentric phase
when you're sitting back too much like
nope nope this isn't quads anymore
sit forward you're like yes that's quads
don't rush the squat get in tune with
your quads and make sure on the way down
you're feeling them a ton on the way up
they take care of themselves just fine
[Music]
next mistake and the last big mistake is
going too heavy
or too light in your squats too heavy in
your squats
is less than five reps it's cool it's
awesome
but unfortunately it doesn't provide the
volume per set that we need
in order to grow the quads the best and
also weight that that's
that's that heavy sometimes it's very
difficult to form a mind muscle
connection
and make sure you're providing tension
through most of the quads it's kind of
gonna
be a whole body effort at that point
cool but the systemic fatigue is super
high
and the local stimulus to the quads as a
ratio may not be good enough
charlie here is an 800 pound squatter in
competition
but when he transitioned to bodybuilding
just recently we took all of his squats
stopped doing them in the in the one to
five rep range which he was doing a ton
of and started doing them in the 5
to 15 rep range that's heavy
especially 5 to 10 but provides enough
reps to get bigger quads and guess what
he doesn't squat 800 pounds anymore he
wouldn't be able to do that for a few
months because he's nowhere near peaked
but his quads are
bigger than ever because of those reps
don't be afraid to do reps stop being
addicted to super heavy weight if quad
size is priority number one now
notice i said five to 15 reps why don't
we do reps
over 15 in the squad because you're
bracing and you've got to brace someone
your systemic ability to hold yourself
upright
and breathe between reps it's now cardio
work or it's spinal stabilization work
your quads are no longer the limiting
factor training in the 15 to 30 rep
range for quads is
 awesome best reserved for the
hack squat
especially the leg press and definitely
the leg extension
triceps of roughly 25 reps in the leg
press we should have a
disclaimer here don't die you're gonna
get up beyond all recognition
it's gonna be awesome
but if you do that for squats yeah your
quads will take a hit just because of
novelty but you'll mostly just be doing
cardio work it's brutal but
not the way we want it so keep your
squats five to fifty in rep range
even in just the five to ten is fine and
let the other accessory work
do the higher reps for you folks that's
all we have for today remember
follow your stimulus to fatigue ratio
clues
make sure you're squatting in a way that
stimulates your quads a ton
tension metabolite burn pump after
training a huge pump in the quads
is a sign you're doing something right
and disruption if you're wobbly on the
stairs after a good squatting workout
that means you hit your quads really
well minimize joint pain
minimize systemic fatigue try to go for
full range of motion and the best way
you know how
you'll get quads bigger than charlie's
or our money back 100
 guarantee see you next time
[Music]
great posterior chain training great
posterior train
good god great posterior chain training
