in other words the subjects experienced
between two to ten times more strength
gains in just over half the time
simply by being misled into thinking
they were on
in this video i'm not actually going to
examine the scientific research directly
exploring if tercesterone works
instead i want to bring the viewers
attention to the extremely interesting
science on why something works even if
it doesn't
first things first
if you're actually interested in the
current research on tercestrone's
effects on hypertrophy and strength i'll
leave a link to an excellent discussion
between jeff nippard and dr eric trexler
discussing all you need to know in the
description
my summary is that simply is weak and
limited evidence currently exploring the
effectiveness of tercesterone
matter of fact there is not actually a
single long-term study in humans
examining how tercesterone precisely
impacts hypertrophy and strength
the most commonly referenced human
research has merely examined
structurally similar compounds to
testosterone but not precisely
terkestrone
now some of you may be thinking sure the
scientific evidence currently fails to
provide compelling evidence on
tercosterone's effectiveness
but there are tons and tons of
individuals out there claiming to have
experienced greater hypertrophy and
strength gains thanks to tercesterone
from reddit to youtube comment sections
and even from the review section of your
favorite doctor's website
surely this is good enough
probably not the problem with relying on
individuals experiences is there could
potentially be an array of confounding
factors
upon taking tercasterone might the
individual have unconsciously or even
consciously altered other variables
might they have started training with
more effort altering their nutrition
sleeping more
or might the placebo effect just have
taken place
that is they believed they were going to
see an effect so they did
well-designed scientific studies enable
us to control these variables to degrees
simply not possible when combining
numerous experiences from individuals
in this video i wanted to zone in on the
placebo effect as i truly believe this
effect should not be underestimated
now i want to make it clear that by no
means am i definitively saying
tercastrone is all placebo
it's completely possible future data
could very well come out and validate
the claims many have been making
surrounding terchesterone
however at this time at least i believe
the power of the placebo effect should
be considered
imagine you're researching terkesterone
reading the numerous anecdotal accounts
you run across
you come across individuals claiming to
have put on x and y amounts of lean body
mass and strength
some individuals even claim they're as
potent as anabolic steroids
this all excites you you start believing
that if you two take terkesterone
freakish gains are possible
when your fresh new bottle of
terkestrone arrives you expect your
gains to supersede what you've
experienced before
how much do these expectations and these
expectations alone influence the gains
you experience
based on two fascinating studies i'd
argue a lot more than people would think
let's dive in and explore the data
let us travel back to 1973 where two
researchers by the name of ariel and
savile aim to answer the question
just how much of the effects of anabolic
steroids are a result of the placebo
effect
15 male versity athletes with at least 2
years of weight training experience
first trained for 7 weeks
during this period those that made the
largest gains in one rep max strength on
the bench press seated press standing
press and squat would be rewarded with
free access to steroids to use during a
subsequent four week training period
as the researchers promised six subjects
of the initial 15 were selected to train
for a further four weeks while given a
10 milligram pill of dianabol an
anabolic steroid to take daily however
the subjects were unaware that this was
a complete sham
the pill they took was a placebo pill it
was not actually dianaball
the results were truly surprising
after the initial seven training weeks
where the six subjects were not taking
any placebo pill
their one rep max's increased by an
average of 4.35 kilograms for the bench
press
0.73 kilograms for the standing press
2.27 kilograms for the seated press and
2.65 kilograms for the squat but after
the four weeks in which the subjects
took the daily placebo pills their
warning max's increased by an average of
13.28 kilograms on the bench press
7.58 kilograms on the standing press 5.3
kilograms on the seated press and
18.94 kilograms on the squat
in other words the subjects experienced
between 2 to 10 times more strength
gains in just over half the time
simply by being misled into thinking
they were on anabolic steroids even
though they were merely consuming
placebo pills
another study by maguinaris and
colleagues conducted in 2000 provides us
with no less of a surprising insight
into the power of the placebo
the lead author of the study was a
powerlifting coach previously his
athletes precisely 11 nationally ranked
powerlifters had asked the coach about
the effectiveness of anabolic steroids
which inspired the coach to conduct
their study
first the researchers assessed the
subject's baseline warner and maxis on
the bench press score and deadlift
note their average one rep maxes were
189 kilograms for the bench press
257 kilograms for the squat and 260
kilograms for the deadlift so they were
pretty damn strong
[Music]
in the first experimental session
five minutes before testing one rep max
on the bench press squat and deadlift
the subjects were given two tablets and
told they were immediate acting anabolic
steroids however this was a sham
the pills were simply placebo more
precisely they simply contained
saccharin
after taking these two pills all
subjects hit personal records the
subjects one red maxes were an average
9.5 kilograms higher on the bench press
12.2 kilograms higher on the squat and
10.9 kilograms higher on the deadlift
versus baseline
fascinatingly the authors noted these
performance increases represented a
change from being nationally ranked to
being internationally ranked for all
subjects
put another way simply thinking they
took immediate acting anabolic steroids
instantly elevated the subject's
strength abilities to seriously
impressive levels
after this first experimental session
all subjects were provided with two more
placebo pills to use during their
upcoming trading week
during this week all subjects reported
increased vigor and that they were
lifting heavier lows or performing more
repetitions than ever before
in the second experimental session
after the week of training
warner max on the bench press score and
deadlift was measured yet again however
before the one rep max test some
subjects were actually told the pills
they took were merely a placebo
these subjects compared to the first
experimental session lifted 7.5
kilograms or less on the bench press 11
kilograms or less on the squat and 12.5
kilograms or less on the deadlift
in other words despite them performing
better than ever before in the first
experimental session and the training
week the simple revelation they had only
been consuming a placebo all along
plummeted their strength back down to
their baseline
the other subjects who remained unaware
the pills they were taking were placebos
did not really make any further gains on
average but roughly maintain the
impressive gains they experienced
compared to the baseline values in my
eyes the results of these two studies
are truly astonishing and depict the
sheer potential power of the placebo
as a brief interlude it's worth noting
that the only reason i'm aware of these
data is that greg knuckles of stronger
by science who i'm not in any way
affiliated to detail these two studies
in an awesome article on the science of
steroids a few years back i'll leave a
link to that article in the description
returning on topic i think the two
studies underscore that with any given
supplement even anabolic steroids
if you have an expectation it will work
profoundly it's more than likely at
least some degree of the gains you
experience can be attributed towards
this mere expectation
now
by no stretch of the imagination am i
saying that anabolic steroids are all
placebo it's well established that
anabolic steroids mechanistically work
for example basin and colleagues
established that after 10 weeks
merely injecting 600 milligrams of
testosterone weekly without lifting
weights produce larger quadriceps area
triceps area and fat-free mass gains
compared to lifting weights naturally
what i am saying though is it probably
is more than likely some degree of gains
experienced with anabolic steroids can
be attributed to the mere expectations
of the user
moreover
when discussing supplements that simply
do not currently have long-term human
data supporting their effectiveness
and we have numerous anecdotes
announcing their effectiveness it's
truly difficult to ascertain how much of
this is attributed to the placebo effect
it might just very well be most of it
finally and separate from discussing
supplements
i think these two studies provide
insight into just how much our
expectations might influence outcomes
with anything
how much might an individual be
restricting their potential based on
their expectations
perhaps we're all capable of a lot more
than we think in any realm if we could
detach from our current expectations and
adapt expectations beyond what we
previously perceived to be possible we
might just experience what we thought we
never could
