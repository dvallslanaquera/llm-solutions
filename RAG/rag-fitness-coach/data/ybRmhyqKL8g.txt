so greg ducett recently launched his new
supplement line
and i've been getting quite a few
comments and dms from you guys asking
what my thoughts are on it he's got a
protein powder and a pre-workout
but this one in particular seems to be
causing quite a bit of commotion and
that's his fat burner
i was reading through the comments over
on instagram and a lot of people are not
overly thrilled with this fat burner

why would you even sell fat burners lol
fat burners is this really coach greg
fat burner equals no credibility thought
you were better than a fat burner
fat burners you became the very thing
you sought to destroy
so basically that fat burner equals a
really expensive coffee pill
in my opinion using the term fat burner
by a knowledgeable person
such as coach greg is just a cheap
marketing tool when i first saw the fat
burner i thought this was a post about
the lies in supplement companies
and that's really just a small sample
there were plenty of other comments
along these lines
now to be fair a lot of people were
accusing greg of
flip-flopping and saying that he used to
be against fat burners
so why is he selling them all of a
sudden so um i did go back to his older
videos
but i couldn't find anything where he
specifically recommended against fat
burners and there were actually
several videos from even a couple years
ago where he did say that he personally
uses over-the-counter fat burners so
unless i'm
missing something or this was some
detailed elaborate scheme where he knew
that he was going to be selling a fat
burner in the future
i don't think he's contradicting himself
in that sense
i also wouldn't say that i'm strictly
against all fat loss supplements
just as long as people understand the
context so that means that you've got a
proper
consistent diet and training program in
place you're in a calorie deficit
and then from there you're just adding
in maybe a few extra compounds to
slightly increase calorie expenditure
maybe slightly reduce appetite as well
and then when you extrapolate that small
extra calorie deficit over the course of
an entire cutting phase
you might end up with a modest
supplemental increase in fat loss
the effects are going to be minor it's
by no stretch of the imagination
a necessity but for somebody who has all
the elements in place
and has the extra money and just wants
to fully maximize things 100 percent
there are some ingredients that could
potentially help out with that
to a limited degree but to actually get
a measurable benefit out of it
you of course need to be using the
proper ingredients and just as
importantly you also have to be using
them
in the right dosages so on that note
let's go through greg's formula step by
step and break down
whether these ingredients are in fact
effective whether they're included in
usable amounts
and i also want to give you just a small
sort of cautionary safety tip
if you do decide to purchase greg's
supplements all right so first up we've
got
l-carnitine l-tartrate so if you have
um like a straight-up l-carnitine
deficiency
then studies show that it can help with
improving muscular endurance
and fat loss to some degree and that's
usually seen in
the elderly and possibly if you're vegan
and you're eating a low protein
intake aside from that there are some
studies showing minor increases in fat
loss probably just as a downstream
effect of
just increasing energy levels in general
and helping you expend more calories
that way
acetylene carnitine is sometimes used as
a pre-workout ingredient
and l-carnitine l-tartrate specifically
this form is typically used
for bodybuilding purposes because there
is some data showing improvements in
muscle recovery and improvements in
androgen receptor density
but purely for fat burning purposes the
data is pretty weak overall
and most importantly the research study
dose for l-carnitine altar trait is
usually anywhere from a thousand
milligrams per day at the low
end up to about four thousand milligrams
and with this formula
you're getting a hundred milligrams so
whether or not l-carnitine
um even works for fat loss is honestly
just irrelevant here because either way
you're not getting nearly enough for it
to exert any sort of measurable effect
okay that's one tenth of the bottom end
proper dose
all right the next ingredient is choline
bitartrate so
choline is generally used for its
cognitive enhancing effects you know
focus memory overall energy
but to really get those effects you'd
want to be using either alpha gpc
or city choline because the bitartrate
form which is also the cheapest one
it doesn't actually cross the
blood-brain barrier there are studies
showing benefits in rats
but those benefits don't appear to carry
over to humans
and in any case again the dosage that
you're getting here in greg's product is
100 milligrams
versus the typical dose of at least 500
milligrams usually up to as high as
2000 or even 3 000 milligrams so this
would be an ingredient that is
um almost certainly not effective in any
sort of fat loss context whether that's
a direct effect or a downstream effect
from increasing energy levels
and even if it was you're still not
getting nearly enough of it anyway
for example in this study from 2016 um
it was on memory performance but even at
two and a half grams it still had no
effect all right the next ingredient
that we have here is called
theocrine now this is a newer compound
it doesn't have a lot of research behind
it but
um chemically it's related to caffeine
and it's usually promoted as having
similar effects to caffeine in terms of
boosting energy
and boosting focus the difference is
that it has a slower onset and then it
lasts
for a longer period of time and it's
also not quite as potent and there's
also
less tolerance build up at least those
are the claims that are usually made
now it's honestly hard to say a lot
about theocrane because there isn't a
lot of research to go on
some of the studies out there combine it
with caffeine so it can be hard to
specifically assess um there's no exact
dosage guidelines but if you look at
most theocrine products
the lowest dose you'll usually see is 50
milligrams
and around 200 to 300 milligrams is
gonna be more common with greg's product
you're getting 50 milligrams so
it's still within range it could
possibly be helpful in terms of a small
bit of extra energy in combination with
the caffeine that's in there which i'll
come back to later on
but there is also some data showing that
low doses of theocrine can actually have
a sedative effect so
um there's probably some individual
variation at play there i'm not sure if
50 milligrams would have that effect
but again it's hard to say a lot about
this particular compound
all right ingredient number four is
cayenne pepper
so cayenne contains a compound called
capsaicin which is responsible for that
hot burning sensation that you feel when
you eat chili peppers
and there are a number of studies
showing that capsaicin can produce a
small benefit in terms of increasing
thermogenesis which is calories burned
as heat energy
and also for reducing appetite so that's
fine
but again we have to look at the dosage
okay if you look at the studies
the typical capsaicin dose usually works
out to around
two to six milligrams per day and
cayenne pepper
has 2.5 milligrams of capsaicin per
1000 milligrams and with greg's product
you're getting
50 milligrams of cayenne pepper so if
you do the math on that
that works out to 0.1 milligrams
of actual capsaicin okay so imagine you
have like a teaspoon of regular cayenne
pepper
that you bought from the grocery store
to season your food with okay there's
1800 milligrams in that entire teaspoon
and then you pinch off
1 30 of that amount and consume it okay
that's what you're getting in this
product per serving

videos
and also give the video a quick like to
help push this information out to more
people
and the next ingredient on the list is
bitter orange also known as
citrus orangium so this is a source of
an ingredient
called synephrine which is chemically
similar to ephedrine
and there is some research showing what
you could call noteworthy benefits in
terms of increasing
overall metabolic rate for example one
study showed that the subjects burned an
average of
65 extra calories over the course of 75
minutes after consuming synephrine
another one showed that synephrine
combined with naringen which is another
ingredient in greg's product so i'll
just include that
here as well that combination burned 129
calories which
would be a decent amount when you
extrapolate it out over the longer term
but once again what are the dosages that
we're dealing with here
okay the research study dose for
synephrine usually falls between
25 to 50 milligrams per day with greg's
product you're getting
50 milligrams of citrus aurangium which
is the actual fruit
and that usually provides around six to
eight percent synephrine so
um again do the math uh which i did
before this isn't coming from memory but
um it works out to three to four
milligrams of
total synephrine which is actually less
than what you would get just from eating
one regular orange
and then for naringen um in the study
that i mentioned they used 600
milligrams
the typical doses for that ingredient
usually start at around
at least a couple hundred milligrams and
greg's product has
50 milligrams all right next up we have
green tea
extract so green tea has been studied
pretty extensively for
a wide variety of different applications
including fat loss
and there is supporting research for
that but it only seems to
really give a significant effect at
pretty high doses
and also in people who don't regularly
consume caffeine so
if you are a regular caffeine consumer
it's hard to say exactly what green tea
supplementation is or isn't going to do
for you as far as fat loss goes but
when it comes to the dosages the active
component
in green tea is a compound called egcg
and
different studies will give different
dosages but to really get into the
sort of truly efficacious range you're
probably looking
at around 300 to 500 milligrams of total
egcg
and the absolute lowest dosage would be
around 100 to 200 milligrams with greg's
product you're getting
50 milligrams of total green tea extract
at 45
egcg which again i did the math before
this
but it works out to 23 milligrams of
total egcgs i mean even
v shreds fat burner has a proper 300
milligram dose of this particular
ingredient what's going on guys
there's black pepper extract at five
milligrams um that's typically just
added into supplements to
increase the absorption of the other
ingredients it's not really an active
ingredient so much at least
uh not as far as fat loss is concerned
next up is
glucomanin which is a type of fiber
that's
really thick and it absorbs a high
amount of water when you consume it it
basically turns into like
sort of a gel like substance in your
stomach and so people will
sometimes supplement with this before
meals to increase feelings of fullness
in order to reduce their overall calorie
intake
there actually are some studies
supporting this ingredient and
obviously anything that helps to
moderate your appetite is going to
assist to some extent with helping you
maintain a calorie deficit
but again following the usual theme here
the dosage is key okay to truly get a
legit appetite reducing effect
the usual dose of glucomanian is at
least one gram
most supplement labels recommend two
grams and you're going to take that
anywhere from
15 minutes to an hour before you have a
meal
it absorbs about 50 times its weight in
water so
at 1 to 2 grams that would be like
adding
50 to 100 grams of extra volume into
your stomach which you can imagine
could have some noticeable effect in
terms of i'm just giving you a little
bit of extra fullness so that you end up
eating less and you can also do that
multiple times per day
with greg's formula you're taking it
once per day and you're getting
one tenth of one gram so that would
expand to
about five grams of total volume which
is
uh maybe a teaspoon worth and the final
compound
is garcinia cambogia this stuff was uh
heavily promoted as sort of a
miracle weight loss supplement quite a
few years back dr oz was
pushing this stuff pretty aggressively
at one time it has a compound in it
called hydroxycitric acid or hca
and it's claimed to increase metabolic
rate and blunt appetite
as far as the actual research goes it
shows some benefits in rodent studies
but those benefits don't seem to carry
over to humans
this is just not a very convincing
ingredient and again it doesn't matter
anyway because the dose and greg's
product is 50 milligrams
which is a tiny fraction of what was
used in the studies and a tiny fraction
of what
most actual standalone garcinia cambogia
supplements provide
and then circling back to the top we've
got 300 milligrams of caffeine now
that's a pretty decent dose
and so even though the other ingredients
in this formula are significantly below
the standard research-backed doses
if you do consume this product then
you're still going to subjectively feel
it working
purely because of that caffeine dose and
caffeine is going to have some modest
effects on overall calorie expenditure
by
increasing thermogenesis it's going to
blend appetite to some extent
and of course it's going to give you
more energy which could then have a
downstream effect by helping you just
train harder in general but caffeine is
a
very basic stock ingredient you know it
costs pennies to include so
i wouldn't really consider this to be
some kind of like noteworthy upside to
the product
um he uses a combination of caffeine
anhydrous and dicaffeine malate
um that second form is 75 caffeine
and 25 malic acid i'm not aware of any
sort of concrete research on that
particular compound it's supposedly a no
crash form of caffeine but
the amount of malic acid there would be
extremely small so
i doubt that really matters and the
label on greg's product doesn't
specifically tell you how
much of each form you're getting anyway
and on the issue of caffeine
i mentioned a quick sort of cautionary
tip for you at the start
which is to keep in mind that greg's
pre-workout also contains
350 milligrams of caffeine for the full
serving so if you're buying these
products as a stack which i'm sure a lot
of people out there are going to be
doing
that's just something to be aware of
because i know there's going to be you
know plenty of newbies out there who buy
this and then combine the products
together without really considering the
exact ingredients and dosages
train harder than last time and they're
gonna end up ingesting somewhere around
like 600 milligrams of caffeine at once
which is a pretty high amount plus they
might even be drinking coffee or tea on
top of that
so to sum this all up on an individual
ingredient basis
there really isn't much wiggle room to
even debate dosages here but
i'm sure the one argument that some
people are going to make is that yeah
the doses are low
but it's the cumulative effect of
combining all of these ingredients that
adds up
to something meaningful and that
argument could make
sense if you were talking about taking
the proper doses and then just using the
lower end
but as you can see here almost
everything is dosed at a tiny fraction
of the very lowest end i mean no one
would accept that argument if we were
talking about a pre-workout formula
so there's no reason why that applies
here either especially when you factor
in the price of 50
per bottle which comparatively speaking
is quite a bit more expensive than most
fat loss supplements
even the ones that contain higher
ingredient doses and would for sure have
higher production costs but hey it's up
to the people how they want to spend
their money
that's the breakdown of the product
based on the ingredients and the dosages
and you can take that information and do
whatever you want with it but i hope you
