hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
hypertrophy concepts in tools
lecture 18 loading variation
let's take a look at what's on tap so to
speak
first we're going to talk about the
loading ranges there are three of them
as to how much weight to use when you're
training
we're going to talk about load diversity
and the benefits of not just lifting
either very heavy
moderate or light but using some of all
three of the ranges
we're going to talk about how loading
affects the stimulus to fatigue ratio
we're going to talk about how to
construct loading ranges over the week
so if you train something like chest
let's say monday
wednesday friday when do you train heavy
when do you train moderate when you
train light it's not immediately
apparent where you should put those
things we'll have some good
justifications
for our decisions here and then we're
going to talk about how to alter your
loading range spread over time as you
learn your body and you see
where you get your best stimulus to
fatigue ratios
let's get into it so
the research we have so far which is
pretty comprehensive it's certainly
better to see more of it
but tentatively between 30 and 85
percent of a one rep max
fresh on a movement uh sees at least in
the short term roughly equivalent
hypertrophy effects which is really cool
uh because it would suck if it was like
only a very specific number like only 55
percent's the best and everything else
is worse than
you know some end of the tail so it's
good we have a big loading range
uh total the overload range for for
loading is very high
uh and uh you know 30 and 85 1rm like 85
percent you sort of might have a feel
for what that is for you
30 who the hell knows if we convert it
to reps on a first set
then it's really you know five reps on a
first set
to around 30 reps on a first set is
there some sort of fungibility there of
course
for some people they're 85 percent
there's really like sort of eight or
nine reps and for some people that's two
or three
on average just something around five
and then you know for some people
35 40 or even more reps is maximally
hypertrophic still but we're going to
sort of play it safe and conservative
and say 5 to 30 reps
on our first set dependably causes very
similar hypertrophy
within that so anything we do five six
seven reps and all the way to
28 29 30 reps if the sets are taken the
same distance away from failure
uh it's probably gonna cause very
similar hypertrophy and what we can do
to make more sense of this huge range
intellectually
is for convenience split it up into
three loading ranges which have some
basis
in physiological reality the 5 to 10 rep
range which we can consider
heavy the 10 to 20 rep range which we
can consider
moderate and then the 20 to 30 rep range
which we can consider light now remember
this is on first sets
so if you do a set that's 28 reps and
then you wait you know 30 seconds or a
minute until your
only your muscles are limiting and you
do a set of 18 reps after
same failure proximity same load that's
still the 20 to 30 range because we're
only talking first sets
okay so okay we got that out of the way
those are the loading ranges let's take
a look at load diversity and the
costs and benefits the benefits and
downsides more specifically of each of
the loading ranges so the 5 to 10
loading range
has a couple of very very distinct
benefits first of all it's very likely
that it stimulates faster fibers
more and better and remember faster
fibers are the ones that generally grow
the most from training
so and some muscles are composed of more
faster twitch fibers than other kinds of
fibers
so the five to ten range is definitely i
wouldn't say indispensable but
definitely advantageous
if you really have to hammer the faster
twitch fibers which may have to happen
because they're the most gross prone
the 5 to 10 range is is a very very good
way to dependably do that
interestingly enough because of the low
number of total reps in a five to ten
rep range
and because the fact that as you
approach failure generally by at least a
little bit
the reps become more effective at
stimulating hypertrophy the effective
reps concept
then uh what ends up happening is in the
5 to 10 rep range you don't have that
many
uh number of lead-in reps which are
really just reps
that for themselves provide hypertrophy
each time but also
to some extent just make you tired so
that eventually you get to the close to
failure reps that
really provide hypertrophy in a set of
five in every single one of those reps
if the set of five is close to failure
at failure every single one is highly
effective because it's the last five
reps that tend to be the most effective
by
probably a small margin but a
significant one you know in a set of 10
you know you'll only five lead in reps
so to speak and then five very highly
effective reps
at the end uh you know compare that with
a set of 30
like how many lead in reps can you have
i mean all the reps grow muscle
but not as well as the last five
probably to
some relative extent uh so you could say
you know if you're making a real hard
argument for you can see you know
the first 25 reps of a 30-year episode
are really sort of like a warm-up
in some sense some sense and then you
really only get your
real best hypertrophy benefits in the
last five but that's a shitload of reps
to be sort of wasting your time as sort
of not completely
and fatiguing yourself for you know what
you otherwise could have done like
right into the set there are definitely
counter examples definitely arguments
against that but it's true to some at
least
small extent so it's worthwhile to say
look if you train in the 5 to 10 rep
range
every fucking rep you do is hypertrophic
very hypertrophic so from that
perspective it's a very efficient way to
train in some sense
right and uh also lastly the last
benefit of the five to ten range
is that failure proximity is very
straightforward remember
muscular failure at an observational
level like we're watching someone go to
failure and curls and at some point they
stop and say they failed
can happen for a number of reasons the
reason we want it to happen is a local
muscular inability to contract at super
high levels of tension
right just local fatigue which is
hypertrophic
but you know failure can occur for a
bunch of other reasons including uh
neural fatigue
one of those types of neural fatigue is
pain perception like if you're doing a
set of 25
you could hypothetically do five more
reps but your quads hurt so much
that you stop look we've all been there
like someone said come on more reps on
the leg press and you're like nope
i'm gonna die you're not really gonna
die and if you know gun to your head you
could have done three or four more reps
but the pain is just too great the thing
is it just doesn't really happen with
sets of five to ten reps
if you've done something with five to
ten reps recently you remember like
failing at rep
eight is basically just comes out of
nowhere right you're doing fine and then
it's really slow for a rep or two
you're not in a ton of pain you're like
wow this is heavy and then you go
and then it's just that's it it goes
stops right so
a lot of times especially for beginners
intermediates getting close to failure
is a challenge
because they don't know where failure is
sometimes they don't know how hard they
can try good news is for beginners it
doesn't matter
but for intermediates it's time to sort
of train a little harder per set
and sometimes the five to 10 rep range
can really let people first of all gauge
how close the audio failures is very
accurate and second of all
actually get closer to failure because
pain's not stopping them
and the previous fatigue of the previous
reps isn't stopping them
from a central governor model from the
nervous system saying hey
we're done you want the muscle to be
limiting so in a set of five to ten the
muscle
is usually what causes the failure and
it's very unequivocal and that's a very
good thing
right however so those are all good
things about five to ten range there are
absolutely downsides number one
the highest acute injury risk is in this
range
that means if something's gonna go pop
or snap
and you have a choice as to where you
know
uh you know where it's gonna more likely
happen is it in a set of five to ten
reps
is it in a set of ten to twenty years in
a seven twenty thirty the probability
that happens in the heaviest range
is way way higher okay imagine
lifting your you know g let's say
80 rm like something you can do for 80
reps it's a
ridiculous a warm up weight it doesn't
matter how close to failure you go
that's probably not going to get you
acutely hurt sure if you do that every
day
can you build up chronic wear and tear
definitely but like how many people
you know like acutely hurt themselves on
like the rower in a crossfit class like
especially when they're not pulling hard
just like regular pace rowing
i mean for the love of god you got to
just be really unlucky it's going to
have to happen now
how many people hurt themselves with a
one rep max attempt and powerlifting
gee you know that's pretty reasonable
it's been shown that the number of
injuries that occur in a training cycle
for powerlifting
is roughly the same as the number of
injuries that occur in a meat
and you think oh well that really kind
of disproves that because in the meat
it's way heavier lifting and in training
it's much lighter
but that's absolute numbers so like
three months of training
caused the same absolute risk as nine
fucking lifts on the platform
wow okay so heavy weight absolutely
predisposed due to slightly higher
injury
and in the long long-term game of
bodybuilding and hypertrophy training
if you can find ways to train that do
not require such high
uh relatively higher risks then it's
really to your benefit or at least
it's something to be revered something
to be noted right
um so the five to ten range anytime you
get under five to ten rep weight
especially if the absolute load is heavy
the compound movements bench pressing
squatting dead lifting assisted pull-ups
or sorry weighted pull-ups
you know five to ten range there's some
real shit that can happen right but if
you grab a pull-down bar and start doing
it for a set of 25
man you know their injury risk is really
just much lower so it's something to
note for sure
definitely uh not a downside in the
sense this is a bad thing but in the
sense that it requires
maybe some thought about programming and
a thought about time and a place and a
thought about trade-offs
right so it's not this sort of refutes
the idea that the five to 10 range is
the only range you should train in
and it's just better okay it's not just
better it definitely has some downsides
right
next one if you do the 5 to 10 range all
the time at the expense of all the other
ranges
you're very likely going to accumulate
more connective uh tissue and joint wear
and tear even over time okay
people who train with sets of five sets
of six that's seven so on and so forth
all the time in hypertrophy training set
after set
day after day week after week so on and
so forth
they just grind themselves to more of a
pulp than people who train lighter
as a matter of fact people who train
lighter sometimes pride themselves on
training lighter because they don't
consider themselves stupid enough to go
heavy all the time
is there an interplay there a little
back and forth for sure
it's a very nuanced thing training heavy
with moderation is a very excellent way
to train and sometimes for people that
are very fast twitch
in various muscles it's the best way to
train but it comes at a cost it comes at
some level of risk
so again we might have a place for
lighter training just because
the cost of heavier training to connect
to fishing joints even over time
might be something that's high enough
for you to not fill all of your volume
with just sets of five to ten
right next a lot of
muscles specifically on some individuals
uh
really really benefit not just from
being worked in a sort of
semi-conscious way like well i pressed
the bar i put it back down i pressed the
bar hypothetically my pecs are working
works really well for pecs but for
something like the biceps
for really for something like muscles
you can't see
in muscles that uh coordinate with many
others
sometimes the smaller muscles in a group
for example the rear delts
really tough to train without a good
mind muscle connection really tough to
guarantee growth so if you just move the
weight
in a dumbbell like rear lateral raise
sometimes a ton of other muscles help
out and your rear belts maybe they get
the whole lot of not much or you can't
even tell how much they're training so
you can't alter your technique you don't
know how to point your pinkies
you don't know you know exactly how much
load to use you know exactly the range
of motion that really hits
your side or your rear belts if you're
training them heavy
can you imagine doing a bent over rear
delt flies in the f like sets of six
what does that even mean you ask someone
hey do you feel that in your rear delts
then maybe like what no i'm just moving
the way i'm just trying to survive here
but it's not even clear that you can
feel sets of five to ten in your
quads when you squat like for many
people yes for sure
but a lot of especially smaller muscles
more intricate muscles
muscles of the back uh in which people
have a little bit more trouble
doing a mind muscle connection with
sometimes because they can't see them
being active
uh well you know there's a downside in
the five to ten rep range it's not ideal
for the my muscle connection
for sure in many cases not all cases but
in many cases
another one is that there's a limited
amount of pump and a limited amount of
metabolite stimulus and both of those
help
the hypertrophy process and the good
news is there's the most tension you'll
ever get
so the tension is a big check mark but
the other stimuli we can't say that
training the five to 10 rep range is a
very balanced way to
approach hypertrophy specifically if you
talk to someone at the gym and they said
you know i only train the five to 10 rep
range because faster fibers and so on
and so forth
you say you know uh you're not maxing
out your hypertrophy response and they'd
be like why not as we have some good
reason to think
that metabolites and the pump are in
some ways
potentially additive in the hypertrophy
response to high tension right so if you
do all three
mostly the tension but a little bit of
metabolites and uh pump
then you'll get the best possible
response right and they won't have an
answer to that because they're like well
i don't get a pump i don't get
metabolites so if you're only training
the heaviest ranges
you might be missing out on something it
might not be a lot but over time it can
definitely add up
lastly remember fast twitch fibers the
fastest twitch fibers
not the only ones to grow and it's been
shown pretty pretty well
that slower fibers and especially what
you could term intermediate twitch
fibers
not quite the fastest not quite the
slowest most fibers probably
um they're probably not optimally
trained in the heaviest heaviest ranges
but they might be trained a better a
little lighter they probably have a
higher volume tolerance as far as
recovery
and probably a higher volume threshold
for what maximally stimulates that
hypertrophy
so if you do like five by five heavy
for your faster fibers that's a fucking
awesome workout
but for your slower fibers and
intermediate fibers gee that's only 25
reps
right and remember they're active from
rep one their slower fibers for example
are as active as they're ever going to
be and through put as much tension as
they're ever going to be
on five reps of a 30 rm and five reps of
a fiver
it's the same to them that they couldn't
care less so
one set of 30 reps does more hypertrophy
stimulus
to your slower twitch fibers than five
sets
roughly of a set of or five by five
right that's crazy okay so if you only
ever do sets of five to ten
then they're faster fibers and the uh
are
totally handled but the slower
intermediate twitch g is probably just
not enough volume it's not enough
repetitions for them
to really stimulate maximally since you
want maximum development
maybe most of your training can still be
in the five to ten but there is some
good reason to suspect that
some higher reps that's in addition to
that can really sort of
close the loop on metabolites on pump
and on getting those slower intermediate
switch fibers there are at least two
studies that are pretty good
that show that uh doing
one just one higher rep set at the end
of a traditional
normal number of heavy sets produces
something like
double or one-third as much hypertrophy
in addition
to the heavy work which you would never
predict based on the additive sets model
right
we've all learned correctly that you
know as you do more
sets it sort of just adds more
hypertrophy
input but when you do a set later it
adds a little less hypertrophy input
than
earlier so you expect in first set it
increases muscle proteins this is a lot
second set a little more third set a
little more but not as much and it sort
of levels off after a while
if you're doing all sets of relatively
heavy it sort of levels off and then if
you do even just one set of much higher
reps you get this new bigger boost out
of nowhere of hypertrophy
and is very pretty obvious where most of
that boost comes from
it is attending to slower twitch fibers
and intermediate twitch fibers were just
they were well on their way to growing
but it just was not enough reps for them
and you might double the number of reps
they're exposed to in that one set
or you know multiply that by you know
1.3
and then all of a sudden yeah for sure
they're getting more volume so
it's really easy to make a little bit of
a fallacy and go from okay faster fibers
grow the most
okay great heavy weight uh stimulates
them the best okay
true so far and then to take those two
and combine it into okay
we train heavy only heavy remember
growing the most doesn't mean
exclusively it's like uh designing a
restaurant around
steak and just perfecting steak but then
like
literally just either having sides that
come out of a can or no sides
someone's like hey i want to order
mashed potatoes with my steak and like
sorry we don't make that we're like do
you expect me to just eat a piece of
meat just right there like yeah
carnivore diet right
something's missing right of course a
restaurant
has to have really good steak if it's a
steak place just like lifting heavy
for faster faster fiber stimulus is a
really important thing
but you might want to garnish it a
little bit you might want to have some
extra stuff because it's not just
bullshit extra
it's pretty critical to maximum results
right you can think of
slower twitch fiber training as mashed
potatoes and greens
let's move on to the 10 to 20 rep range
okay so we sort of fleshed out the 5 to
10 rep range what about the 10 to 20
range
good news lots of good news here
the 10 to 20 range definitely has a not
the same good ratio of lead-in reps to
effective reps as the 5-10 but it's got
a really good one
okay because it's not a crazy number of
reps 10 to 20 is reasonable
so good ratio of effective reps to lead
in reps here's the real good news it
stimulates all fibers robustly
okay it does some justice to the slower
twitch fibers tons to the intermediate
twitch or probably most of your fibers
and is still heavy enough to pretty
robustly stimulate the fasteners your
fibers especially because
in a set of 10 to 20 reps you don't tend
to get a lot of this
intraset fatigue that once the faster
fibers have to turn on to really help
they're too tired to do it you do get
that in a 20 to 30 rep range which we'll
talk about
but in this rep range you know if you do
a set of 12 and then you have to take it
to 15
right the last three reps to failure you
can probably really muster
your fastest twitch fibers to really
push some tension through
help you out and thus get some growth
where if it was like you know you've
done 22
reps and now to get to 25 your faster
fibers
might be so inundated by lactic acid uh
and excitation contraction coupling
might be so off that they barely even
turn on at all which is a problem we'll
talk about later
so it's really robust of a stimulus to
all
of the different kinds of muscle fibers
that you have which is really good
we'll say this formally in just a second
but if you only have to do one rep range
which is
ridiculous because you almost never will
10 to 20 is probably where it's at
on average for most people most muscles
right
um another good piece of news this range
probably promotes some of the highest
mind muscle connections right the
problem and we'll get to this a little
bit more specifically the problem with
super super high reps
is that the pain might be so high and
the tension so low that the first couple
of reps are just banging out there's no
mind muscle connection because you can't
perceive any tension because the fucking
weight is
very low and by the time you can
perceive the metabolite burn
it comes with so much unbelievable pain
and neural fatigue that you're like oh
my god i can't believe you just get me
out of here
and then you miss the mind-muscle
connection all together in a set of 10
to 20 you kind of get the best of both
worlds of enough tension to perceive it
from rep one
and also a really nasty metabolite burn
towards the end to really get you that
metabolite burn part of muscle mind
muscle connection
but you're not overwhelmed by the number
of reps you're not overwhelmed by the
amount of pain because the pain just
lasts for a relatively short time
then you go to true failure which is
relatively easy to gauge here and then
you're good to go
so really good best mind muscle
connections probably in this range for
most muscles
it's not overly difficult just like we
said uh
to gauge uh or reach failure right like
if
if you do a set of 14 and someone's like
more like yeah like if you have two more
you know when it's two more
it's not like oh i can just keep
grinding them out like 20 to 30 reps and
more
you can sort of keep grinding them out
as long as you can take the pain to some
extent
um in the 10 to 20 range especially in
the 10 to 15 range
you know in the smith machine incline
bench you know when the bar stops and
that's it it's your muscles it's not
your your cardio is not what's limiting
you
your pain tolerance is usually not
what's limiting you it's just you know
ischemic rigor your muscles are done
contracting which is very unequivocal
and very good for tracking training and
making sure you're training hard enough
it's not uh the good news is this
range is lighter and thus not overly
taxing not nearly as much on the joints
and connective tissues
be it acutely or over time as
the heaviest range as the five to ten
and interestingly enough
very related to that uh the acute injury
risk is not as high right so another big
benefit at least over the 5 to 10 range
and lastly and we sort of hinted at this
already probably the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio
on average by a small margin uh is going
to be found in the 10 to 20 range for
for most folks right so
i'll put you this way if you only train
with sets of five to ten
and with sets of 20 to 30 oh man you're
going to really like sets of 10 to 20
because it's going to be a really
awesome combination of both of those
that obviates a lot of problems in both
of those especially at the extreme end
so a lot going for this however
the 10 to 20 range has downsides it is
not immutable to those so
let's take a look at the downsides first
of all the 10 to 20 range
hits the faster fiber is great but it's
not the best possible stimulus for the
faster fibers
five to ten still does that better
especially in fibers they're very very
fast twitch your muscles very very fast
which the fatigue very easily
especially when another muscle in the
chain is also very fast which also
fatigues easily and prevents that muscle
from getting targeted for example
stiff-legged deadlifts
you have to maintain uh you know a very
rigid uh lower back
in order for your hips to tilt properly
to put the stretch in your hamstring
attention on your hamstring two problems
one
if you train your hamstrings with that
time under tension because stiff like
another
slower of 15 reps by the time you get to
15
your hamstrings might just be tired and
your faster fibers never even got a
chance to really work because by the
time they really started to elevate
their abilities
and generate high tensions per fiber
they were so inundated with metabolites
that are basically done right off the
get-go something like stiff like a
deadlift with its cadence
and with its reliance on high forces
probably best done in the five to ten
rep range in addition to that
your lower back could be giving out by
the time your hamstrings are even
starting to feel it which is real bad
news
because you might not even approach
failure locally in your hamstrings where
you need it to be
so if we're really really interested in
the fastest fiber stimulus
or if you have an athlete that somehow
through biopsy is confirmed to be a very
predominantly fast twitch
you're probably going to see better
results on on average with them in the 5
to 10 rep range and of course
because we all have fiber distributions
in all of our muscles there's something
to say for the heaviest training loads
for sure
right and on another point
yes metabolite generation is really
really good with
the intermediate range but it's not as
good as it is with the highest range
the slower fiber stimulus is not as good
so there's something still missing right
when you try to be the best of all
worlds it's usually not going to work
out same with a 10 to 20 range it's
good but it's missing both the faster
fiber optimal stimulus and the slower
fiber optimal stimulus
lastly especially if you're approaching
a contest or something especially from
training for multiple weeks and multiple
months on end
um you know the 10 to 20 range is still
heavy enough to beat up your joints and
connective tissue significantly
and because we have this other range
that's lighter and beats up your joints
even less
even if the 10 to 20 range is super
super effective we might want to pull
that
uh the cat out of the bag every now and
again to
train significantly lighter even if it's
for short purposes or short periods
because of how realistically even less
connective tissue and joint disruption
damage risk of injury occurs
from the even lighter range so again the
10 to 20 range gets like a b
plus in the connective tissue department
and injury risk not an a plus
which the other much lighter range
actually gets
lastly benefits of the 20 to 30 rep
range the highest rep range
first of all huge the best metabolite
stimulus okay you want to burn that's
where you burn
great pump stimulus a lot although
sometimes the faster fibers
get their best pumps in the lower rep
ranges but just with the sheer amount
of uh alterations in metabolites that
you see
you probably get a pump just from that
and it really if you know if you had to
get the best pump of your life in your
quads
10 to 20 is probably a good place to do
it but
sometimes it might be 20 to 30 and that
might be the case with many other
muscles not all of them but
many muscles as well by far the lowest
injury risk
right so you're doing sets of 20 to 30
if you get hurt doing a set of 20 30
for love of god you just had it coming
right or your technique is total dog
shit or your load management sucks
something's got to give the load here is
as safe as it's going to get
and still get you trained for
hypertrophy and
it's easiest on the joints of connective
tissues so again there's that benefit
there of
you know if you have to train for
another month because you got a show or
you got a vacation coming up and you
really want to peak for it
but your joints are a little messed up
because especially if you've been
hypochloric dieting
you know there's something to be said
for maybe introducing more of the 2030
range
because it's going to robustly stimulate
hypertrophy but it just doesn't beat up
your
joints and connective tissues nearly as
much it doesn't risk injury
injuries nearly as much i'll put you
this way if you need a very very good
example of when it's time to really
mostly train in this range
imagine that you have the mystery it's a
ridiculous example but nonetheless
illustrates the point theoretically
if you have a super important
bodybuilding contest you're turning pro
or you're winning the you know natural
mr missouri or you're winning mr olympia
or something and every level of contest
that's important to you
let's say you know you've had peck
injuries before and your pec tendon is
just like if you're gonna be honest
between yourself and god in the mirror
not feeling so great you are
fucking on point your glutes are coming
in your veins are all over your face
shit is looking good and you know your
competition and you know if you nail
this peak and it's fucking happening
you're gonna win this fucking show and
it's a big deal to you
are you gonna train in the five to ten
rep range for your pecs
for the next four weeks fuck why would
you
can you imagine in week two of popping
your pack maybe it's not even a visible
tear but you've got to modify your
training to something that basically
doesn't work
you come in your pecs look a little flat
your arms don't look as good as usual
people can tell like man his upper body
is not as hard as it usually is
oh my god that's fucking terrible you
get second place that's awful
would you train in the 10 to 20 rep
range yeah it's probably pretty safe
right but
what if you really wanted to stack the
deck to try to win this thing what's to
keep you from training mostly or
exclusively for that month
in the 20 to 30 rep range or sure as
hell is an effect because science has
pretty much solved that one you can get
great results
especially for a month no problem
why wouldn't you do it what's the chance
you reinsuring your pack in the 23rd rep
range almost zero
why would you do it give that some
thought big benefit there
right maybe not something always to use
a lot definitely a time and a place
now downsides big downside
when you go to failure in the 23rd rep
range and they've run into this problem
in experimental studies and uh dr eric
helms has
written about this extensively you're
not really ever sure if someone's
reaching failure at the muscular level
which is the failure that correlates to
best gains
or at the neural level of at some point
their brain spinal cord which can
include conscious processing like pain
perception
that's my what may be limiting them so
for example
someone stops at 25 reps on a lat pull
down
and you're like failure right and
they're like yeah dude for sure but
reality is they just didn't want their
lats to hurt anymore because the pain
from training
that much and that many metabolites is
nuts and remember you don't need to
generate that much more force to do one
more rep because
it's just not that much weight so if
you've ever seen someone truly go to
failure on a set of 25 or 30 reps it
looks awful
they're yelling they're screaming and
more oomph you know like when you really
just
nut up and you say some really crazy
shit and you do one more app like ah
you do another one ah you do another one
if it's five to ten reps this shit just
doesn't work
like at some point you might buy
yourself a rep and then you scream again
and you go
and the squat bar just falls on you
because you're done and there's no
negotiation because the
step you have to make an ability to get
another rep between eight and nine reps
heavy
is fucking enormous and it's
insurmountable but
if you did 27 reps the amount of oomph
you have to generate to get 28
is just not that much it's possible and
sometimes just by resting an extra
second between reps
you just regenerate enough to get
another rep right
so this means that you might not be
training as close to failure as you
think
it's also been shown that being very
close to failure especially in those 20
30 rep range
reps is what confers a lot of
hypertrophy if you're not super close to
failure in the 5 to 10
all the fibers are still active when
you're doing any reps you still get lots
of hypertrophy
if you're not really close to failure on
20 to 30 man
you're going to be missing something
right and so
people are tough everyone's tough but on
average
it just doesn't seem that it's as
reliable and you can ask consistently
approach failure
in the 20-30 rep range something to keep
in mind right
next their effective reps model has a
bit of a problem with it as originally
proposed
it said basically that you know all of
your fibers are relatively dormant
until they're needed to be called for
action to generate enough force to help
you get another rep
so the idea is you know slower twitch
fibers turn on first in a set of 30
and then as they get tired then the
intermediate fibers have to kick in to
help them and as they get tired the
faster twitch fibers have to help them
and then when they fail there's nothing
left and you fail to set
so in effect it's basically saying that
the vast majority of fast rich fiber
activity occurs
in the last five reps unless all the
growth you find is in the last five reps
well it turns out that most of the data
actually show that
all the fibers are sort of active all
the time just to different proportions
and unfortunately really unfortunately
faster twitch fibers
are fatigued much faster than the other
ones so even if they're operating at 20
or 30
capacity for 15 or 20 reps by the end of
that
faster fibers are just kind of done and
they never had a chance to produce the
highest tensions
so they actually missed out on a whole
bunch of their hypertrophy
and both from their own generation of
metabolites and from neighboring fibers
the metabolite generation is now so high
by the time you reach 20 reps or
something
it's also been shown very clearly that
faster twitch fibers
get the most force reduction and
contraction ability reduction from
metabolites
you can inundate slower fibers with
metabolites and they just keep going
faster fibers you inundate them with the
metabolites they're a lot and they
freeze at a bunch of different levels
right they just stop working either
nearly as well
or just much faster than completely so
we have this idea that like okay
we'll get the same faster fiber stimulus
if we just make it to set you know rep
25 and go 25 to 30 to failure that's
actually not true
so there's a very good reason to believe
and some researchers confirm this
directly
that if you want really the best faster
fiber activation instead of five to ten
is the way to do it
can you get some good faster fiber
activation instead of uh of
20 to 30 to failure yes we got two
problems now
first of all even if you go to true
failure you're missing some faster fiber
activity just from the fatigue problem
and the fact that they give out earlier
and second of all
remember the neural limits to failure
proximity so you might
be telling yourself that you're getting
close to failure but you're really three
or four off
it's a two-factor problem so if you
really want to zap all of the muscle
fibers in your
muscle the 10 to 20 range is better for
that if you want to zap the faster
fibers specifically the 5 to 10
the 20 30 range probably is apps or
slower which fibers the best but
remember they're the most growth prone
so this is not something like
the you can't read the benefits of the
20 30 range and be like man why do we
ever
do anything that's heavier than 20 to
30. if i train 20 30 i'll get all the
gains
none of the injury risk well you
probably won't get all the gains
certainly not in the long term right
lastly mind muscle connection is a good
thing it promotes hypertrophy direct
research to show it
really tough uh due to pain right my
muscle connection for a set of 15 reps
very possible probably the best rep area
rep range to get it in
25 reps 30 reps you're just trying to
survive at that point a lot of times it
takes something really really diligent
really pain resistant to have a high
mind muscle connection and also
that many reps it's tough to focus on
the mind muscle connection for every
single one of those reps there's some
neural fatigue
sort of neural boredom that occurs and
if you're really focusing on a muscle
for 27
28 reps for the love of god you just
need a break right but if it's 15 reps
you can zoom in on your pecs with your
mind
for 15 reps probably no problem right
so where does this leave us because all
of the
the ranges have their ups and downs and
because the ups and downs are
complementary a
mix of the ranges is almost always the
best idea for example
in a specific muscle groups training
you might do four sets a week on any
given week
of five to ten rep range training you
might do
eight sets a week in the 10 to 20 rep
range why because most people have the
intermediate fiber split
and also because the sfrs are probably
on average of the highest
in the 10 to 20 range so just this
example biased a bit more to the 10 to
20 range
and then another four sets in that same
week in the 20 to 30 range we're getting
the best of all worlds
mostly training in the middle but
definitely not ignoring anything
probably a good way to approach low
diversity
at first what's that at first because
there's ways
to modify right so
loading and sfr huge huge deal here
all three loading ranges are
theoretically beneficial
but how beneficial they are especially
for a specific
individual for their specific muscle
group that they're targeting at the time
and even by exercise is different
and by exercise one is an easy example
what's better to do in the 5 to 10 range
squat or leg extensions who the hell
does leg extension the 5 to 10 rep range
well leg extension is not an exercise
that's conducive to
tons of maximum force throughput through
your quads
then again who does squats for a set of
25 to 30
that's insanity it's just training for
your lungs and not your legs
whereas for a leg extension you know
25 to 30 that's a really really awesome
stimulus for leg extension so even per
exercise definitely per muscle group
and for each individual it's not always
well you know you got to go for the
middle
10 to 20 mostly and it'll leave about on
the edges it turns out
that stimulus to fatigue ratios can
differ
between the loading ranges and
individuals muscle groups and exercises
some individuals
might get their best sfrs in the five to
ten rep range for some of their muscles
in some of their exercises so it turns
out that when we look at any individual
we look at all of their muscle groups
and exercises there's a lot of
variability there in which loading
ranges they prefer
the most for those muscles not just
prefer on an i feel it basis but on what
actually works well basis so how do you
mitigate or how do you deal with this
incredible diversity well
by auto regulation and by feel right
actually training and seeing what's
going on
try training a muscle group mostly in a
single range just so you get a lot of
signal
without a lot of noise so you're trying
to figure out for my biceps which
range do they prefer you might not know
try training mostly in the five to ten
range
you know ten of your weekly sets in the
five to ten range
one of your weekly sets in the 10 to 20
one of your weekly sets in the 20 to 30.
you're getting a pretty good feel right
check to see how sfr is we have an sfr
calculator from earlier lectures right
how much stimulus you have on all the
you know pump and
disruption and so on and so forth my
muscle connection
and then see how much fatigue there is
joint connective tissue fatigue rpe so
on and so forth right
rank on sfr and then do that for
gee i would say at least a mesocycle
probably two right
two mesocycles of really really heavy
bicep training on average
then alter your training to another
range
mostly the 10 to 20 or mostly the 20-30
and then repeat
okay and that same thing can be done per
exercise right
you try the chest machine press at your
gym and mostly five to ten range
and then another two mesocycles later
you try it mostly in the 10 to 20 range
or mostly in the 20 to 30.
and what you find out is where your
preferences are
you could be doing cable flies in the 5
to 10 rep range for a mesocycle and be
like this is
fucking stupid my shoulders hurt i can
barely feel my pecs
i don't get a pump i don't get sore
nothing's happening this sucks
you try the 10 to 20 range same exercise
incredible stretch incredible
contraction super high mount muscle
connection crazy pump tons of soreness
win win win win win your joints feel
fine and then you try it in the 2030 and
you're just like i'm getting just
tired at this point like i don't seem to
get a pump i don't seem to even have
mind muscle connection it really hurts
towards the last couple of reps but like
i just feel like i'm training like my
pecs for endurance right
maybe not the best so boom you found
that the middle range were best for you
and
in that we could do a total leader for
example stiff like a deadlift five to
ten range
amazing everything's awesome yeah it's
heavy and it beats up your joints a
little bit but like
the pump is so real the stimulus is so
real attention from my muscle connection
so incredibly real the soreness is real
you're like wow this is great
you go to 10 to 20. it's pretty good but
like you seem to just get mostly tired
your back starts to give out
you know you have to do more sets to get
the same amount of delayed outside
muscle soreness which is you know not
everything but
says something uh and all of a sudden
you know it's good training but ah man
it's really not as good
and you do a message cycle of 20 to 30
with definitely enough so you're like
wow this is definitely just a mid-back
workout
your hamstrings never even feel like
anything's happening except that they're
getting tired
and your back is getting sore especially
in your middle back from having to do
this the entire time and keep you
nice and erect so nice and erect
so basically after that you can
tentatively conclude that look you know
can i do stiff-legged deadlifts in the
10 to 20 and 20 30 range yeah maybe a
couple sets here and there but
more of my work maybe not even most but
more
should be done in that range in which i
get the best sfr right
all the muscles all the exercises have
preferred ranges
they can change over time we'll talk
about that in a little bit how you
always have to be
vigilant about it but for the time being
for the next you know macro cycle
training block you're kind of starting
to figure stuff out about your body
so well i just uh basically
did this whole thing but we'll work
through it real quick so loading an sfr
example here
your quads might get the best mind
muscle connection pumps and disruption
from 10 to 20 rep sets
uh but you know they might also get less
joint connective tissue disruption at
that uh
rep range uh clearly not less than 10 to
20 but maybe the mind muscle is not as
good there and the pumps are not as good
the rpe per volume is relatively low and
unrelated exercise interference per
volume at that rep range is low
like you might do a set of five to ten
squats and it just beats you to shit for
the rest of your workout but instead of
10 to 20
squats or leg presses and you might feel
totally fine you do other exercises
after
on the other hand so 10 to 20s may be
best for your quads 5 to 10 might be
better for your hands right
um here is a huge point in addition to
that
maybe within one session certainly over
the course of one week and
definitely over the course of one
mesocycle
overdoing one rep range
tends to promote stainless in it and
drop its sfr
to where the rep range you're not doing
at all
might eventually become one that's worth
doing itself
for example if you do all
of your hamstring training in the 5 to
10 rep range
after five sets gee whiz you're just
stimulating the same muscles in the same
pathways
if you do even one set at the end of
those five or on another day monday you
do sets of five to ten wednesday do sets
of
ten to twenty you're stimulating a lot
of different muscle fibers a lot of
different ways
different pathways and all of a sudden
that's really awesome that 10 to 20 is
not usually your best bet for hamsters
but because you have taxed so much out
you've gotten
so much out of the 5 to 10 well it's
time to dip your bucket in a different
well
and because it is different because it
is exploiting different pathways
it already might have just some small
advantage to put this sort of visually
your sfr for the 10 to 20 range is
usually here and your 5 to 10 range is
usually here
but after five or six sets monday's
workout
your sfr for the five to ten is here
notice
the 10 to 20 has a superior ability
that's one of the key principles
or key implications of variation it's
the variation
it's the stainless that makes variation
work right
uh you know the usual kitchen analogy
you might
love rice more than pasta period like if
you have to show up to a restaurant
there's a pasta dish in rice dish you
always pick the rice dish because you
love rice you love rice this much you
like pasta this much
how many days in a row do you have to
eat rice until you're like fuck i want
something different
and you you eat pasta and your friends
would be like oh my god were you eating
pasta i thought you liked rice better
you're like well
yeah i do but i'm kind of fucking sick
and tired of rice right it doesn't this
this can apply to anything in life and
it absolutely applies to training
so we don't want to get into this idea
that like for me my hamstrings prefer
the 5 to 10 rep range
that's it maybe but that's unlikely and
some amount of work even the majority of
your work can be in the 5 to 10 rep
range or whatever other rep range you
prefer
because you're not doing another rep
range you're not exploiting its
uh differential abilities to grow you
and
because stainless develops in a rep
range specific fashion
this also happens with exercises by the
way everything else
automatically some diversity should be
injected into the plan
whereby you might still do most of your
training in the 5-10 rep range but some
of it is now
looking pretty good in the 10 to 20. so
you might do this thing
where you know you train eight sets in
the five to ten
three or four sets in the 10 to 20 and
one or two sets in the 20 to 30 and
that's your best
possible approach that gives you the
highest absolute
sfr over the course of the week pretty
decent idea
speaking of the week how do you arrange
these things over the week is our next
question
we've made a pretty good argument for
the fact that within each week
you should probably be doing some of the
loading ranges for pretty much every
muscle group
at any one time okay got it but
when in the week do you do that do you
do that the same day or not what's the
answer
well let's take a look at some
physiological realities first
faster fibers take longer to recover
than slower fibers
okay so if you train faster fibers at
any one point you're going to want to
train slower fibers for a while after
during which the faster fibers recover
and during which time they're not
re-stimulated okay so that's point
number one
point number two the highest absolute
forces which we have to impose to train
the fastest fibers by the way
risk more injury to highly fatigued
structures than to less fatigued
structures so if
you were to train in the 10 to 20 rep
range on monday
and then in the 5 to 10 rep range on
wednesday
you're doing quite a bit of pre-damage
here in the 10 to 20 rep range
and then a 5 to 10 when you have to lift
your heaviest you're lifting your
heaviest with tissues that are already a
little bit frayed
your chance for injury now could be a
little bit more significant
whereas if you flip the two around you
train in the five to 10 rep range and
expose yourself to the highest risk
and then of course you get some fraying
from that right some some
micro tears but then what is the chance
that a micro tear
is going to occur or is going to
transpire into a
what james hoffman is called a mezzo
tear right a macro tear an actual injury
in the 10 to 20 range man
it's much less likely than if you spin
it the other way around
right so you essentially want to be as
fresh as possible
for your heaviest training and here's
another one let's say you were friday
to the 20 to 30 rep range beat up from
two sequential workouts
five to ten and ten to twenty you're now
pretty well fucked up
but who the hell gets hurt in the twenty
to thirty good
god you would have to be like uh your
ten doesn't have to be on a string for
you to hurt yourself there
versus imagine flipping that around
monday you do 20 to 30.
not a ton of damage but you know some
and then wednesday you do 10 to 20.
uh okay not good because you're now
accumulating quite a bit of damage
and then friday you're like yes time to
impose the highest forces and really
just hurt myself
my bodies are ready to be hurt that's
ridiculous it's completely the other way
around
right so lastly
we know that as fatigue accumulates it
becomes
more difficult to get a mind muscle
connection
right which means that if you do
you know your moderate work first
and then you do your heavy work after a
couple days later heavy work already
interferes the mind muscle connection
quite a bit it's really tough to
establish
and now you have a problem where you
know you've done your best my muscle
connection work up front
and now your mind muscle connection is
going to be dog shit you might as well
start from a perspective of mind muscle
connection
isn't the best when you're super high
fatigue but that's when you do your
heaviest work
and then as you go lighter and lighter
and lighter because you're fatigued
mind muscle connection generally tends
to improve especially in that middle
range
and you might not have such a problem
with it where it's it's
no workout is just awful for the mind
muscle connection at that point which
would be
if you flipped around and went lightest
all the way to heaviest
right so putting all this together
means that in many cases heavier range
training should occur earlier in the
week and not even earlier in a calendar
week
but sequenced over multiple weeks over
any two weeks
of heaviest moderate lightest
a little bit more rest to really
recharge the system and then repeat
because we basically have a situation
where very light training
can be totally effective in a
situation with lots of fatigue and it's
very low risk of injury and you can
still activate lots of fibers with him
and simultaneously we also need to be in
a situation where we're most rested and
most fresh
for our heaviest training lightest
training can occur in the highest
fatigue state
heaviest training needs to occur and
refresh us that automatically sets up a
template if it doesn't really matter how
you do it
you should have a situation in which
your heaviest training has the most rest
before it
and your lightest training can occur
with very little rest whatsoever
so for example monday
you could do in the five to ten rep
range for like let's say your biceps
wednesday biceps mostly 10 to 20 range
work
friday biceps 20 to 30 rep range work by
then you're really fucked up but here's
the deal you take that actual little bit
of rest
two days saturday and sunday really
drops fatigue
and then you enter next monday's five to
ten very low fatigue which you'll need
to maximize heavy training
and lowest injury risk because you've
had a chance to heal
for two reasons one your last workout
on friday was with relatively light
weight
okay so it didn't actually damage a lot
of tissues whatsoever now contributed to
general fatigue and
muscular fatigue but maybe not
connective tissue fatigue that's good
and also you got that extra day this
whole thing works pretty well
if you give it some thought if you play
with other arrangements they tend to
have bigger shortcomings than this one
right here now
that doesn't mean that everything needs
to be monday wednesday friday here's the
deal
you could do wednesday
you train your heaviest range
on friday you train
your moderate range so heavy moderate
and then on sunday you train your
lightest range
okay so far so good and then monday
tuesday are off
to give you that little break
wednesday's heavy again
that doesn't mean you have to start your
week with heaviest but
generally you can't always make this
work but on average especially for
muscles
that that require really a lot of gusto
to train like your quads hamstrings back
you know for biceps and try some new
fuck all it doesn't really matter you're
not going to get hurt almost certainly
for muscles require a lot of gusto and
muscles that require lifting of very
heavy weights that have a real injury
risk
you want to approach it as any if anyone
looks at your program it should be
heavier moderate light rest a little bit
more
recycle and whether that cycle starts in
the middle of the week at the beginning
of the week or even at the end of the
week and goes into the next week
doesn't much matter what you just don't
want to do
is be like yeah i just did like light
training yesterday today i'm doing my
heavier work
oh maybe you don't want to do that
coming in super fatigued
to your heaviest work on a performance
level that's not good because your
muscles will be so tired they're not
going to get your best performance
and on an injury risk perspective that's
not the greatest thing anyway but if
someone said listen i just did my
moderate work yesterday
and i'm doing light work today that's
probably fine
right it probably stimulates plenty of
hypertrophy remember lighter work
targets the slower twitch muscles
more likely more and slower instruments
recover so fast that a day
later even if the faster twitch muscles
haven't recovered those larger muscles
are already recovered a day later
they're really good to go
at this point so give that some thought
and probably a good way to do things
right
so over time
so what we've given you now is a
snapshot of how to build your week of
training
and over several mesos how to figure out
what is
best for your muscles and what's worse
for your muscles
so as you do each muscle group and as
you do
each measure of training you apply a
certain ratio of loading ranges like you
know for quads
i'm doing 25 of my volume in the
heaviest range 50
to moderate and 25 and the lightest okay
for hamstrings
it's you know 20 percent and then 70
and then 10 something like that right so
you apply these loading ranges
with the exercises in certain fractions
and you note which of these ranges are
fractions of ranges rather and it's
always a mix
give you the best stimulus to fatigue
ratios i mean you're not experimenting
you're just training normally
with a keen eye for what's working and
what's not and then
when you pick your next mesocycle unless
it's some special mesocycle in which you
you have to alter ranges for other
reasons like fatigue or injury risk
you alter your uh loading ranges
into the direction in which they seem to
be going the best for example
you just did a bicep mesocycle where you
experimented with doing 80
of your training in the 10 to 20 rep
range and you're like man that went
really well i loved
the 10 to 20 rep training and when i was
doing the heavier and lighter it just
felt like not great
in the next meso you might do 90 10
right and then at that point
after that message maybe you know that
was like it got pretty stale
and honestly like some of my higher rep
work felt even better
than some of my moderate rep work well
then in the next cycle maybe make a bit
room
for lighter rep work that way as your
sfrs adjust
you train something a lot that's really
good it's not sfr falls and the sfr
relatively of this other thing rises
and then you train it like this so
you're always trying to pick what's best
just like someone gives you you know
every night before dinner i don't really
live like a king
they give you 20 of your favorite foods
and you pick two of them to eat
you're going to want to like not just
randomly go through the foods or cycle
like well today it's lasagna i don't
fucking want lasagna but that's what i'm
having i theoretically want it
right you want to pick the foods that
are tastiest and
naturally because you remember hopefully
what you ate yesterday
and how you felt about it you might pick
lasagna three days in a row and then
you're like you know what lasagna's
taking a break for a week
oh you know mac and cheese looks great
today and so on and so forth can you
guys tell i'm dieting i'm fucking uh all
i
talk about is food so but that makes
sense right because you naturally allow
your proclivities
to determine which way you uh dig into
your diversity right
so uh
i'm going to say this i don't want to
beat the beat this too hard but
never eliminate any ranges unless
there's a very good reason to do so
right you should always have some of the
rangers even if it's just a set really
heavy or just to set really light
it's usually good for diversity
sometimes you can eliminate it for an
entire mesocycle or even an entire
block but for an entire career very
unlikely that you
never train hamstrings again in the five
to ten rep range
because when you find that you do train
them in the five to 10 represent after
let's say years of
being convinced by someone not to do it
you might find that you actually get
incredible training like what the fuck
was i doing not
doing that well you sort of learned too
quickly you were way too sure that it
wasn't going to work
and then you sort of bowed out too early
right so it's definitely a problem you
don't want
and as you do this kind of training
both per muscle group and per exercise
figuring out the best
ratio of rep ranges and sometimes an
exercise often
you're just going to correspond with
just one rep range at any one time
you could do leg presses in the five to
ten it's not like you're going to do
more leg presses in the 10 to 20 after
you probably just switch to exercises
like leg
extensions or something like that but
leg press and measure one can be done
five to ten
in a meso two could be done ten to
twenty or leg presses can be done on
monday
in the 5 to 10 you know wednesday and
the 10 to 20. so there's always some
balance there
as you do this you're really going to
get a feel for where your highest sfrs
is get a good balance
of the highest sfrs which always
requires calibration right so if anyone
tracked how much volume you do for your
whole body over the course of multiple
months
in the 5 to 10 10 to 20 23 range it
should look like this all the time
right now there may be a distinct bias
in some muscles to the middle range
or the highest ranges or lowest ranges
so on and so forth
but it should always be a little bit
fungible you never want to just be like
okay this is exactly how i'm training
forever that's stupid because your body
changes
and variation dictates that lasagna is
not always going to taste the best
compared to everything
sometimes mac and cheese taste better
sometimes the 10 to 20 rep range the
23rd rep range will gain an advantage
over your otherwise typically preferred
range of 5 to 10
for example it's a never ending
adjustment process
pro bodybuilders not so great at a lot
of things
very good at this almost all
bodybuilders who've been training for a
long time intuitively know
where exercises are to be done about rep
range and what ratios
they can feel it this is something to be
really good at
and the only question left is is there a
sequencing of loading ranges that we can
do
in a phase potentiated manner like
through a training block is it good to
train heavier first
and then moderate then light or is it
the other way around we'll talk about
that in a later discussion
of loading range with face potentiation
and i'll see you for that
