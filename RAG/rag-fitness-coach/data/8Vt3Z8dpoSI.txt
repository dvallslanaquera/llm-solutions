dude I take every set of failure every
exercise I take one set to failure every
session I take at least one set of
failure and really like just grind out
it turns out that training three two one
reps away from failure is amazing and
that's not to the limits and it works
really well and people can say well hold
on a second how do we know it works well
we have tons of direct studies on it now
that compare training shy of failure and
training to failure and the training shy
of failure almost always beats the
training to failure in the compared
groups
