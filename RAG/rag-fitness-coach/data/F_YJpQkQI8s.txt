oh
hey what's up guys so i'm basically just
gonna walk you through
the last week or two of my
dup bench capacity phase where my bench
press went from
3 31 at the beginning of the phase
to 365 tested at the end
you can check my instagram for the for
the video of that
so rather than take you through all the
days one by one i've just put some kind
of random footage together
so on this phase i did high bar
back squats because the low bar position
was still
irritating my back uh and so we kept the
loads really light
i started with forty percent uh in week
one and ended with
sixty percent in the final week
and since then i've switched back to the
low bar squats which
aren't giving me as much grief now
and then the other main primary movement
that
we focused on in this phase for lower
body was
the dumbbell bulgarian split squat
and here you'll see i i did try to my
best to focus on the eccentric control
and i progressed upward in weight as the
week went on
uh they were really difficult
it's a tough exercise and keeping
balance can be frustrating at times too
then from there i would move on to some
more isolateral work i just do single
leg
leg extensions to an rpe of nine
and this is something also that's set
towards my
future goals and bodybuilding i think
that if i want to be able to stand next
to guys like jose
i could do with bringing up my quads a
little bit
and we focus so much on my hamstrings
and glutes in the off season
robin and i trained together with the
different
modes that we're using this is how we do
it so robin loads on her weights
and then we just do the math to make
sure it
ends up being what i want after
so anyway i don't know why i put that in
there randomly but i was saying that
my hamstrings and glutes were brought up
so much over the last two years
with all of the powerlifting centric
training
that my quads seemed like they actually
might have
comparatively gotten a little bit weaker
and i'm speaking in terms of
bodybuilding here
so this was 275
one day and then uh i would do that for
um five sets of four
and then the very next day i would
move up to four sets of two with
what ended up being ninety percent in
weeks
three and four uh and you'd think it'd
be quite difficult to work up to
such a heavy load on consecutive days
but
the repeated bout effect definitely
came into play and i was recovering a
lot faster
from training sessions especially in the
later weeks
and because my back was giving me so
much trouble i basically just did
cluster sets on deadlifts one of which
you've seen there so
i would do eight sets of one
with what ended up being um
as high as 72 and a half percent
and that was kind of annoying because i
did want to lift some heavier weight but
now my back's feeling a lot better so
i'm glad that i
played it safe there and just used the
the short 30-second rest periods
and just did eight to ten sets of heavy
singles with deadlifts throughout the
whole phase
and here i'm gonna do some weighted
pull-ups which was something that i
was able to progress in even as i gained
weight throughout the phase
boom
and then this was sort of some of the
fluff work that i used to throw in
because
again i do have bodybuilding as a goal
of mine and i'm not just strictly a
power lifter so
and i like this machine this is an
awesome machine one of my favorite ones
at the gym that i
go to so i like to throw it in when i
can and
i'll substitute this in for wide grip
seated table rows sometimes especially
as i find the
the full range of motion with the wide
grip cable rows can sometimes put a
little bit of
extra stress on my back so i like the
feel of those a little bit better
again biceps have always been a weak
point of mind so
got to keep the curls in there uh you'll
notice i
am using a squat rack to curl here
and there was no one in the gym so i
took the liberty of doing that
and i usually reach concentric failure
on the sixth rep of these
and then the final two or three you can
see i'm using a bit of momentum there
too
to do a little bit of good cheating
so this i think is the fourth week of
training here i just had a bunch of
footage and i just put it all together
so
the reason i didn't move up in weight
this week was that my back was actually
hurting me i remember a little bit on
this day so
i just stuck with 225 again sometimes
you've just got to do that i mean even
if the weight
is that's prescribed is a little bit too
much for you to handle then sometimes
you've gotta
just swallow your ego and
do what you can do safely
and here i am doing some more of these
god forsaken bulgarian split squats
tell me
and i just figured i'd throw this in at
the end this was my first time low bar
squatting
at the end of the phase so this was
after week four
and it's just 380 which is 120 pounds
off of my
all-time pr but you can tell i mean the
weight isn't difficult for me it's just
a matter of working around
the pain at this point and since then
i've gotten quite a bit better with the
low bar and it's feeling good again
