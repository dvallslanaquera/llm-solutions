if we want to have a serious attempt at
improving pull-up ability essentially
three things we have to do first is put
on vertical pulling muscle then we take
those big muscles in the next phase and
we train them for strength and at this
point we integrate some dieting as well
to reduce your body fat if you diet very
slowly during a string phase especially
as regards your pulling musculature if
you eat plenty of protein eat well train
sufficiently hard which will be for sure
then what you end up doing is you're
losing a bunch of fat and probably no
vertical pulling strength at all
