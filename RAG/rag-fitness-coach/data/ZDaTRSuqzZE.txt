hey folks dr mike israetel here
again boring last time
we covered deloading and how to do it
for strength and hypertrophy
this time we're going to do after the
deload how do you build your
next hypertrophy plan because you just
did one
maybe you liked it maybe it was good
where do you start and there are a lot
of questions
that come up it can be pretty confusing
after you're done deloading and you have
to build your next plan hopefully you
build it during the deload so you have
something to start with in your first
week
a lot of questions for example should i
keep the same exercises i did in the
last mesocycle
or should i switch great question some
nuance there how many reps should i do
right what kind of weight should i use
how much load do i have to keep
progressing linearly and load very
common question how many sets do i start
with
and so on and so forth luckily we have
some rapid pretty easy answers
so let's get right into things with
exercise selection easy easy formula
guideline here for you guys that you can
use all the time for hypertrophy
exercise selection
here it is if
the following occurs or is occurring
with your exercises you keep them the
same don't change them now you can't
change them if you want
but you probably shouldn't here's the
deal if you are still hitting pr's
mesoderms
like you're doing squats and you hit a
squat pr like for reps
like best out of 10 ever two months ago
last month he hit another squat
set pr another pr of tens okay if you
tell me hey should i change out squats
for something i'll be like
you're getting stronger right you're
like yeah killing it like why take it
out like oh
right because a lot of times some
exercises are strange you have to find
your footing again you have to rebuild
momentum if the momentum is good
for the love of god keep going unless
okay
your mind muscle connection is poor or
something like that or your pumps are
poor but they're not
so if your mind muscle connection is
good you're feeling the target muscle
like not only hitting pr's in the squats
but it's not just prs for the sake of
numbers like your quads are being
annihilated you're like oh my god my
quads are just getting trashed
and you're getting crazy pumps another
check in the box
to keep that exercise okay and
if you don't have any nagging joint or
connective tissue pain or injury or
weirdness
for sure keep if you can check all three
boxes awesome if you can just check two
of those
it's an argument if you can just check
one you should probably be switching the
exercise if you can check zero
you should for sure be switching
exercise what would check zero look like
you haven't pr'd in the last mesocycle
or two great
you have crappy mind muscle connection
no pumps or poor pumps
and you can barely get sore or anything
like that you just feel like you're
wasting time
and you have tons of nagging injuries
and joint connective tissue if you kept
doing that exercise
that would be a good diagnosis of
insanity right and
to our next point you want to replace
exercises of score on the other end of
that spectrum
if your last meso didn't result in pr's
now this is a fungible one because if
you're in a fat loss meso
sometimes prs don't come easily but
especially if your last metal cycle was
a muscle gain phase
for sure bad sign if you're not hitting
prs and strength on a muscle gain phase
something's up and if you're doing the
rest of your plan well and i'm assuming
you are
that exercise has staled out on you and
it's probably time to switch it out
right or the prs happened but like we're
way lower than the mesos before and you
could be doing a job
better with another exercise like you
typically gained like you gained 15
pounds in your first mezzo on the squat
you gained 15 pounds in your second and
your last measure you gained like
technically two and a half pounds on the
squat like
you're really gonna like put it in again
because technically it was a pr
maybe not right it's come to a pretty
close to a halt
second point if your mind muscle
connection is just not very impressive
if your pumps are not very impressive
relative to how many sets of that
exercise you're doing
and the disruptions are not impressive
like you did like six sets of squats and
you barely got sore
and you barely got a pump and you can't
be honestly say you felt your quads as
much as you used to when you were
squatting it's just
just feel stale man you know it's
probably not worth fatigue you're
imposing
you could do a better job with another
exercise that's fresher and newer and
does all those good things
with fewer sets and less load much
better to do
that much better switch it and lastly
this is a big one
if you have nagging or increasing joint
and connective tissue pains
uh that is not a good thing
um and sometimes that can come in
with okay it's a technique issue
like you have joint connective tissue
pain and then someone comes in or you
come in and you're like okay i'm sitting
back too much in the squat and you sit
down more and you open on my knees more
you solve it technically and then you're
good to go fine don't just change out
exercises because you have problems
so if you have problems in an exercise
that's kind of hurting you try to alter
the technique maybe take a little bit of
load off the bar alter the technique
if that doesn't work and especially if
it's like your elbow's getting worse and
worse and worse every time you close
grip bench for the last three weeks
don't close prevention the next measure
because remember in hypertrophy training
the specific exercise doesn't matter
nearly as much as that the muscle group
is targeted
and there's tons of other ways to target
your triceps in your chest other than
close grip bench
so if it's kind of destroying you
incrementally even if like somehow you
could solve the problem with a ton of
rehab
and a ton of this and some of that
accommodations why bother just trade it
out and bring it back in later when it's
not irritating those joints and
connective tissue so
anytime you want to know if you should
keep an exercise or replace it just look
at this chart if it leans one
more one way or leans more the other way
that is the
correct choice there's very little
ambiguity here right and if you're not
sure
which one you slide into you're like i'm
kind of a bit of both
then either choice is probably fine
right then don't worry about it then
just go with your gut be like ah you
know
i'll keep it in right or i'll trade it
out no big deal either way okay
next all right so we picked our
exercises meso is partially constructed
how many reps should you be doing okay
well by default you probably just want
to do the same rep range as you did in
the last meso
write the same split of rep ranges which
means some exercises sets of 5 to 10
some 10 to 20 and some 20 to 30. okay
diversity of rep range is always best
now you can choose to alter the rep
ranges to meet various goals
right that's totally fine and
especially if you change exercises like
so for example if you were doing squats
and sets of five to ten
and now you change exercises to leg
extensions
or leg presses geez that's a five to ten
it's kind of heavy for those exercises
maybe they're better suited for such a
10 to 20 or 20 to 30. so that's totally
fine so change your weapon just totally
fine
and here's the thing to to sort of
assuage you of any guilt you may have or
paranoia
people say okay i did squats in the five
to ten range in the last meso
what should i do them in this mezzo it's
okay if they're again five to ten
okay just recycle the weight a little
bit and hit another pr on the same rep
range
no big deal it's also totally okay
if you have squats five to ten rep range
in mezzo one
and 10 to 20 rep range of mezzo two and
some of you say well hold on
doesn't that violate overload your
squats are lighter now
if you were training for pure strength
abs so fucking lutely
it would violate overload in strength
based overload you want the load
progression to be dominant always
heavier
on average in hypertrophy training if
you're going
closer and closer to failure with
incrementally higher or stable volumes
you're overloading and you're growing so
it's absolutely no big deal to do
heavier work in one
meso and then lighter work in the same
exercise even in the next the overload
can come
from just increasing volume or getting
into a range that's more productive on a
stimulus to fatigue ratio
basis yes that's a 5 to 10 are fine but
then your knees hurt a little bit
you drop it just a 10 to 20 you get
better pumps better mind muscle all of a
sudden even more growth
so don't worry about using less weight
from one mezzo to another as long as
you're pushing
yourself hard in whatever rep range you
choose right
and here's the deal if squats for
example are feeling
too heavy to connect with right in the 5
to 10 range or if inclines are feeling
like
really really tiring and not heavy
enough like in the 10 to 20 range
it's okay to make either switch so you
can go from the
10 to 20 range down to the 5 to 10 or up
to the 20 to 30
in any way you want as long as you're
following the stimulus to fatigue ratio
as long as you can justify that whatever
range you picked doesn't matter which
one you did in the last meso
in any big way whatever rep range you
pick
is really good in the stimulus to
fatigue ratio whether it's the same rep
range one that's higher one that's lower
it's totally fine
but if you pick a rep range and the
stimulus fatigue ratio sucks
you pick the wrong rep range or maybe
the wrong exercise right but since we've
already handled exercises
here just on reps do a good job to pick
the best sfr
assume it's going to be the same one
because oftentimes it is especially once
you build momentum like you don't want
to build up squats from 300 to 400
in sets of 5 to 10 and then have to go
back down to 275 do so that's a 10 to
20.
a lot of people are like dude i'm in it
i've got my technique worked out for
this heavy range i want another meso
totally it's golden
as long as you don't trash your joints
or your perception of effort
for just pointlessly getting more weight
on the bar when you're not even feeling
in the muscle anymore right
now once you choose a range simple
solution
there is you pick a load that you get
you into that range
with two to four reps in reserve because
sometimes you're like well how do i know
what load it is
well it's whatever load gets you two rir
or four ir
at the beginning of that next mesocycle
now how do you know that
and that brings us to number three of
how much weight we should be using
at the beginning of the next mesocycle
right the answer
overwhelmingly is whatever weight falls
into the two to four range
from which you can progress all the way
you know 3r2rr 1
0 and then d load after that right
totally fine
so there's some stuff here that you just
have to be realistic with
and this is the biggest thing this whole
slide can be summed up with
be realistic and also summed up with be
a little bit conservative just in case
for example
let's say you hit 400 for the sets of
eight in your last mesos peak week
at zero reps in reserve we set sets of
on average eight
with 400 as hard as you could go
okay is it realistic that you're now
three rir
is gonna be 405 pounds for eights no
good god
maybe you gained a ton of fitness over
the course of the deload
maybe it's gonna be you know 390
pounds that you can hit for eights at 3r
maybe 380 maybe 370. who knows
it's probably not going to be even more
so this idea
that you have to move up objectively in
load every single meso
from the highest load you did is pure
unadulterated bullshit
if you're a beginner and that's how fast
you're progressing and if for you
400 was really zero r and a week later
or two weeks later
it really is 405 it really is 3rir
unbelievable you're making excellent
gains don't let anyone stop you program
away
but if you know you're pushing it way
too close
then 3rir like it's actually one rir
where are you going to overload in the
second week you're going to hit zero rrr
and then what you're just trying to
failure with multiple sets
your fatigue is going to go like this
your ability to perform is going to go
like that and you're not going to have a
real mesocycle with which to have really
really excellent gains charted out
that's it right so much better for most
people on average
is maybe throw 380 pounds on the bar in
that example hit your sets of you know
about eight or three r
and then move up at the end to 410
pounds
in your last peak right so you started
the last
mesocycle maybe at 360 and you move to
400
this one you don't have to start at four
or five you start at like 380
and maybe you move to like 410. that's a
10 pound pr
for reps that's a really really awesome
thing can you imagine if every mesocycle
gave you a 10 pound pr
in the same rep range holy fuck after a
year you would have like i don't know
like a hundred pounds on your lift
that's crazy you ever seen see someone
go from squatting 400 for sets of eight
to 500 sets of eight in one year
it's almost unheard of and your quads
would like triple in size or something
like that so
even that 10 is a really really extreme
gain and it's nothing to be shy about
the idea that you can go to from 360 to
401 meso
and then 405 to like 445 in the next is
like
it happens sometimes to us more
beginners was a very new exercise but
it's nothing to depend on you have to be
realistic
right the good thing is if you mess up a
little bit
and you had a few more reps or a few
less reps like let's say you throw 380
on the bar
and instead of getting eights you some
magical thing happened and you got sets
of like nine on average even 10 on
average
at a true three r or you just feel kind
of like crap and 380 was a bit much you
should have chose 365
and you got sets of five and six at 380.
that's not a big deal because the rep
ranges are wide
it's anything in the 5 to 10 rep range
anything in the 5 to 10 rep range on a
first set by the way
not even on average is totally good and
meets that criteria anything that 10 to
20. holy crap
that's a huge range like i've had people
message me and say hey
i'm trying to train in the 10 20 rep
range and i got
18 reps on my first set am i doing a
good job yes
and other people like i got 12. that's
wrong right how the fuck is it wrong
these 10 to 20 is 12 in 10 to 20 yes
then you did a good job
is this a loading range it's a proxy for
load not exactly reps
clearly that load falls into that range
so you're totally good to go
so what i'm saying is don't spend a
trillion hours doing einstein shit
on your pen and paper to get your
wrapping calculator out to figure out
exactly how much weight am i going to
use
on this next meso just ballpark it and
as long as it falls in that rep range
and it's really three
r-ish at the first meso week of the next
one
you're totally good to go with
everything autocorrect anyway right
it's okay to start with less weight than
you ended with as long as you
end at a slightly higher weight or more
reps almost every mezzo
that is the definition of progress to
that end
really really great quote by brian miner
somebody you should be following uh
on instagram sorry i don't mean to
pedantically you shouldn't
no should be following highly
recommended brian miner uh super super
sharp guy
a really really great coach he always
says overload is a
range not a fixed value your body
doesn't respond
to getting bigger and stronger by
squatting 400
one week and then anything under 401
or 400.99 just doesn't do anything to it
you could squat 400 400 400
for weeks on end and never increase the
load and get
bigger that entire time and stronger
that entire time it would just kind of
start to go like this
right and if you did just 400 and raise
the reps you would get amazing results
for a super long time too
so squatting 400 in this last week and
then going to 380 in the week after
is still effective as long as you go 380
385 or 390
400 etc and you're close to failure that
entire time
you're getting awesome results it
doesn't have to be super exact
next how many sets do you start with
because you just finished with a whole
crapload of sets right
all you do is you had a deload so you
detrained a little bit and you want to
use the whole mev to mrv range
from minimum effective volume all the
way up to maximum recovery you're going
to start at your best estimate of your
rough minimum effective volume
right now if you've been doing exercises
if you've taken exercises you did in the
last meso and you brought them over
verbatim like
high bar squats hybrid squats into this
next one your minimum effective volume
might not have moved up at all or it
might have moved up by one or two sets
per session okay so instead of your mvv
being four sets of squats like it
usually is
maybe it's four maybe it's five maybe
it's six probably not
maybe like it's five so if you're real
paranoid about doing enough you could do
begin this next meso at five sets of
squats instead of the four you did last
time totally fine but there's nothing
wrong with beginning in an mvv you think
hasn't changed
may very well be occurring right now if
you haven't done an exercise in a while
use old mevs that they had before from
when you were tracking them and you
should be tracking them right
so basically
you wanna know what minimum effective
volumes are for historical exercises
you've done let's say you haven't done
inclines in a long time
so you're gonna do barbell inclines for
the first time in three or four mesos
and i tell you the instruction is okay
you're just mev
you look up the mev and you're like but
i didn't do it in the last measure who
the hell knows what my videos well you
should have all your notes scribbled
down or hopefully in a computer
of like where you've started with
inclines before and you should have
noted what your pump and soreness is
like
so that when you start inclines you're
not like i'm going to do 10 sets like
that's an e
ridiculous move what you might do is be
like okay last time i did inclines
was six months ago and i started with
four sets and i noted that it was like
kind of a killer pump and like way too
much soreness
i'm gonna start with three next time now
we're talking okay so that's what you
want to do for lifts that haven't
occurred in the last meso
at the end of the day what you want to
do is
target volumes that in your first week
give you a little bit of a pump and a
small disruption weakness soreness so on
and so forth right
so what you can actually do is not
really know exactly how many sets you're
going to do
have a rough target at mev in your first
week progressively continue to do sets
in in a workout when you had a pretty
decent pump
and your muscles feel kind of a little
bit drained and beat up stop
right this is what i do i come in and
i'm doing squats and i'm like i think
it's somewhere between two and four sets
now some mesocycles i do two sets and
i'm like i don't feel
anything i do three and i'm like i'm
starting to feel something i do four and
i'm like okay there it is and then i cut
it off because remember we're gonna
build from there
but sometimes i'm like okay two to four
i come in and do one set and i'm like
whoa i kind of have a pump and i feel
pretty drained and then you two and i'm
like that's it we're done
because this is gonna be like if i do
three or four i'm gonna be sore for a
week and a half and that's really stupid
right because then soreness directly
interferes with muscle growth if there's
too much of it and also doesn't let me
productively train later in the week and
so on and so forth
right here's the thing we increase
volume as needed
in later weeks anyway so if you guess a
little too easy no big deal
if you guess a little too much it can
screw you up for the rest of the
motorcycle so
play conservatives my recommendation so
here's an example
last measure you start with five sets of
squats in a session and you worked up to
ten before you deloaded not
a recommendation just an example in one
session this mezzo maybe you'll start at
six sets of squats and like work up to
11 or wherever your mrv is remember
you're not targeting 11 you're not like
i have to do 11. it's got to be more
you're just going until you can no
longer increase your performance which
is where your mrv is
and then you stop then you deal it just
like we talked about in last video
right now an example of an exercise you
haven't done if you haven't done
lunges for example this is a pointed
example because lunges will mess you up
like this
if you haven't done them in many many
mesocycles the last time you did them
that was the third mesocycle in a row
and you started with five sets in the
third mezzo in a row
okay what you want to do is maybe do
like one or two sets of lunges and
really feel out how disrupted your
glutes feel and how pumped you are
and ease up because a lot of times
lunges you're like look at it on paper
like i have like lunges barber lunges
115 pounds
for sets of 15 to 20. man like i can
knock these out no problem because i
just squatted 300 pounds for reps this
is easy
you do one set of lunges and your glutes
start to cramp and you're like holy crap
i can barely walk
and then you say to yourself some stupid
little volume demon comes up
and he's like hey you should do more
nobody does one set you need to do four
or five because you're a bodybuilder
another one's like yeah randy coleman
videos and you're like the hell is wrong
with me am i insane or should i just
listen to these demons and you listen to
them you do four sets
and you're fucking crippled for like a
week and a half because your body's not
used to lunges
and the damage is unreal so if you have
new exercises and lunges are a good
example because they won't mess you up
like this
a new exercise that comes in you haven't
done in a long time err on the side of
easy and really track your pumps and the
level of disruption
like if you haven't done skull crushers
in a while and you do like two sets and
you're like
holy triceps just stop because you can
always add sets later but if you go too
far in one session
you get no bonus points you don't grow
any more you could actually grow less
and sum up enough fatigue to disrupt the
optimality
of your next progression that you're
doing right starting a bit low is always
better
than starting a bit high so
closing remarks check this out we just
built our new mesocycle that's awesome
we have everywhere to start we already
know how to progress and we're golden
right starting conservative in the first
week of the mezzo i
know it sounds like a fucking bitch move
like oh yeah
first week you're so fragile yes we're
gonna be tough
but we're gonna save the tough for later
tough is when you choose to increase
in the last week is when you choose to
hit pr's in last week versus take time
off or
or just be like i'm done last week
second to last week third to last week
that's when you get tough
when you're just entering the field of
battle so to speak be easy
right start with sets and load and wraps
they're a little bit conservative you
get no bonus points for starting too
aggressively and downsides
all right next tip is overload is not a
linear process
it's okay to take one step backward
to take two steps forward that's better
than taking one step forward and then
one step backward again okay
so after you've squatted 405 pounds for
the first time in your life
it does not mean that anything shy of
405 is just not going to get you jacked
or strong anymore
that's total bs things taken close to
failure even a 100 pounds for you
taken close to failure in a set of 30
will grow muscle so as long as you're
within
three and zero rir and as long as you're
within between minimum effect of a
maximum recall
volume the progression should take care
of itself over time
nothing to worry about unless you're
really slacking off so once you really
think you're slacking off
don't overburden yourself with this
linearity of progression progressions
for more advanced people is going to
look like this
okay not just one straight giant line
into the moon
and here's the thing if you've gained
adaptations mesoderms
which is how they happen and reveal
themselves because you gain adaptations
and fatigue over the meso but then after
dealing you drop the fatigue and you
just get to see how much rep strength
you've gained
if you're training correctly you're
going to be increasing your performance
and that's going to automatically ramp
up all of your stuff anyway
and here's the deal if you plan on
hitting like 380
for sets of eight and you get to 380 and
you're squatting it you hit one set of
eight
and you rack it and someone's like was
that r3 and you're like dude that was
like r8
i'm a fucking god you can always do more
even in that
session you can put more random then go
to 390 right or you can do tens
or you can be easy on that session and
go to
400 next time instead of 380 or do some
combination of rep
and load increases it's always easy to
go up as long as you're honest with
yourself
what you don't want to do is go up too
soon so that you have to backtrack
because when you backtrack you're
definitely not gaining
but when you're a little bit
conservative you're still gaining and
you can always increase the pace of
gains
by doing more folks let me know if you
have questions in the comments
and hopefully some of you other folks
can read them and answer them and if you
can't answer them i'll try to answer
them with later videos
see you next time for some of those
