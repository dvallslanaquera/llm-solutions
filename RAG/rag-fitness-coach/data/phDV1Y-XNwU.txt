hey folks dr mike back again video
number three in this series
we finished hypertrophy we're enormously
jacked and pretty fucking strong but we
can get stronger
let's design a powerlifting strength
program
together oh oh my god you guys it's our
first time designing program together
instagram if i can document everything
stories live is that how dating works
nowadays
i i dated back in you know 1865
or whatever we didn't have digital
devices but i'm sure like
you know like if you're a girl and you
tell your girlfriends that you're going
out on a date
and they like expect like live stream
updates like oh my god he's in the
bathroom
guys kind of taking a long time right
right the fuck are we even talking about
i probably swore a little too early the
algorithms are going to punish us for
that
anyway what are we talking about today
what's the purpose of a powerlifting
strength program
okay like isn't it just a powerlifting
program it's kind of redundant
what do we have to do before we start
training session assignment exercise
selection loading range
relative effort initial volume and next
video
i'm going to go a little bit faster here
in this video
then maybe is ideal standalone because i
really want you guys
to go back and watch at least the first
video of hypertrophy plan design
and that's going to give you such an
awesome base of understanding that video
is a little slower
that when you get to this one you're
going to be like oh this makes a shit a
lot of sense so i'm going to try to go
in meticulous enough to make sure we
cover all the bases but some of the
stuff we were like well he didn't really
explain a ton of that
if you watch the aperture video which
you should to get a full understanding
of a problematic cycle
that's going to fill in a ton of the
blanks for you all right so
what is the purpose of a power lifting
strength program is to train your
muscles and
nervous system to produce more force
and thus build a great base of general
strength
that really produces your powerlifting
total this
means you have to build strength in the
movements that transfer most
to the three lifts which can be the
three lifts themselves
now you can get stronger just doing the
lifts themselves
with singles and doubles you can but not
at optimal rates because a lot of times
you need a little bit more volume to get
as strong as possible
then singles and doubles can get you at
the expense of their fatigue
so it's not the most optimal thing to
just do singles and doubles because you
need so much work you have to do a lot
of sets and it really fries you out
if you do sets of like three to six reps
which is what a basic strength phase
that we're talking about here is
it works out much better for overall
long-term strength progress now of
course
when you want to actually do me you have
to do a peek-in program which is
dominated by singles and doubles
right once you've notably gained that
strength and you're ready to transition
and actually compete
then you can do a peeking program to
show that strength off we'll talk about
that in later videos
all right what do we have to know before
we start well
how many days a week we can train which
we covered on a hypertrophy video
earlier in the series
what movements and lifts you want to
bring up it can be all of them or it can
be some you can bring up your bench in
your squat your squat or deadlift or all
three so on and so forth
and of course the best exercises for
each muscle slash
movement group and the movement's really
what we want
you want exercises that improve strength
in the movements the best
relative to how much fatigue they cost
and you want them to transfer well to
competition exercises
it's not just about increasing your
ability to push really well
but you're doing tons of incline work
that might not transfer so much to flat
benching you're like man my ink cleanse
taken off like sweet if you're a
bodybuilder or somebody who competed in
incline benching that'd be cool
but ideally you want lyft very similar
to the actual lifts and of course you
can use incline
in context but maybe it's not the only
thing you should use and a question of
course comes up can you use the
competition lifts themselves in a
strength phase
absolute fucking literally you can it's
not the only thing you can use but you
can definitely use them as well
all right training session assignment
i'm going to breeze through this because
it's really straightforward
and because we covered the hypertrophy
video early in the series
if you want a serious attempt at
strength enhancement i highly recommend
four sessions a week at least
you can do up to six if you can recover
for them if you've done four for a while
and you don't know if you want to try
six don't
try five okay and a five works out
really well after a couple of mesocycles
then you can try six
but if you have an important meat coming
up stick with five what you know you can
do or four
and then maybe next uh macrocycle after
your meat
in the next hypertrophy phase then you
can try six and then we'll see if you
survive the
high frequency can really work super
well but can really beat you up so be
very careful with it and if stuff is on
the line err on the side of caution
err on the side of less sessions should
address
movement categories two to four times
per week so two to four times a week of
pushing of pulling
of squat patterns super cool of course
you want enough time between each one to
heal
so have enough uh productive energy to
do a next good workout
deadlifts are the exception as covered
in hypertrophy they can only be done one
time a week if needed because a lot of
times they have too big of a fatigue
cost
they cost too much accumulated fatigue
but but
some kind of posterior chain work to
support those muscles and their strength
and their size
should be done uh probably at least two
times a week so you don't have to
deadlift
twice a week but the other day maybe the
other leg day you have
or some other way you structure it you
should have like good mornings or glute
ham raises
or stiff like a deadlift something like
that you can even do deadlifts but
lighter
and for sort of technique work totally
fine but it's got to be some other kind
of posterior stuff
you don't want to do like deadlifts once
a week and then quads twice a week
and then just your hamstrings and your
erectors and your glutes just really
left alone for an entire week not ideal
not ideal and of course
really important for strength sessions
need to be split up as far apart as
possible
so the fatigue dips down before you do
your next one you don't want to do the
crazy ass
heavy bench on tuesday and then
wednesday go deadlift with a sore back
you got from arching
stupid idea if you bench heavy on monday
if you want a deadlift heavy
maybe do it on wednesday or do it on a
friday squat between them you can figure
it out
if you're super fucked up from another
lift going into this one maybe it's not
the best strategy in the world
so sample read it pause on your own time
it's almost identical to our hypertrophy
phase the question is
do you have to structure your strength
phase similarly or identically to your
hypertrophy phase
with sessions and days and stuff no
absolutely not
but but here's our little gem of wisdom
if you already know that you respond
really well to a certain hypertrophy
structure
you've figured out your volumes you know
what gets sore when it heals how it
adjusts
it's probably good to keep a good thing
going and just stick with that paradigm
so do you have to stick with the same
paradigm no but you might not want to
change too much between hypertrophy
phase and a strength phase
so that you know you can roll into a
strength phase and it just goes really
fucking well
because if you do a hypertrophy phase
and you're like oh i got this fucking
einstein shit planned for the strength
phase due to all these weird undulating
this and that super trippy program
it could be that you're onto something
and you just have a phenomenal result
could be that you're like fuck
i'm not healing nearly as well as i
thought and fuck when i'm supposed to be
doing bench again my triceps are still
sore weirdly from deadlifts or something
what the hell is going on
if you have a template that works change
it a little bit
before you change it a lot so status quo
kind of wins out on this one
in most cases not all but most all right
how do you pick your exercises exercises
for strength should have a couple of
checklists
very similar to the ones for hypertrophy
you want to be having exercises that are
strength stimulating
have a raw stimulus magnitude that's
really high that means
that like they create a high level of
tension can let you produce a fuck load
of force
for example is a bosu ball squat a
really good strength exercise fuck no
because it's so unstable
it doesn't allow you to produce a ton of
force now here's the real kicker
that critique extends a little bit to
some other movements
a lot of times dips dips with extra
weight attached
they're a little unstable and they don't
allow you to produce maximum force
because you're not that stable
and it's not the best strength exercise
close grip benching or jm presses are a
better way to get stronger triceps
stronger triceps not bigger
usually than dips are because of that
instability what about dumbbell
work can you do dumbbell bench press
like to get stronger for sets of three
to six i mean
theoretically you can you know on rack
and do three six with dumbbells but
because of that instability dumbbells do
not allow as much force production
as a barbell a barbell super fucking
stable compared to dumbbells so
here's where barbell movements really
really really went out
and you want to have them as stable as
possible and
this is where some movements like dips
dumbbells uh
and actually a funny one front squat
like a front squat is a little bit
unstable unless you're a real ball or
front squat or where you're just like
a duck in water and super stable front
squats are pretty good for hypertrophy
work especially
in like five to six seven rep range it's
not choking yet you're not out of breath
but as far as strength movement man you
can usually produce much more force
because you're more stable
and more aligned in like a high bar
squat and it's almost all the same
muscles producing it versus a front
squat so consider that
whatever your most stable variants are
it's a good chance that they're your
highest raw stimulus magnitude
and of course conducive to heavier
loading sets of three to six
again assistance work which you will do
here i'll show you an example of can be
done on the five to ten rep range even
as many as 12 reps but generally
speaking you want to conducive to heavy
loading and that's another one where
if you can't load something a lot it's
not going to be a great strength choice
let's say you have dumbbells to go up to
100 pounds
and you can do you know the hundreds for
sets of like
five to ten are you going to choose the
dumbbells for sets of three to six
the fuck would okay but now your rpe is
like four
right so it has to be a movement you can
load scale
and be stable enough with those are huge
considerations you have to be able to
produce tons of force and if you can't
do that
and you can't push yourself hard it's
probably not the right movement for you
next should be a high transfer to power
lifting movements if you get really
strong in a leg press
sweet but if you get really strong on a
high bar squat better
if you get really strong in a low bar
squat probably even better right so
there's a scaling factor there and you
have to apply that
compounds went out over isolation
similar movement patterns
as far as uh powerlifting moves are
concerned here's another one
if you have a choice between like a
deficit deadlift or just like a one-inch
deficit deadlift
for strength enhancement or a stiff leg
a deadlift unless you really need to
specifically strengthen that
stiff-legged deadlift movement pattern
um the
one-inch deficit probably wins out
because it is more similar and probably
transfers to deadlifting better right
for hypertrophy to get bigger hamstrings
yeah stephanie godella wins that one but
for strength maybe the deficit wins a
little bit more
right the powerlifting moves themselves
absolutely can be used surely can i
get stronger by deadlifting in the three
to six rep range
in my competition style absolutely if
you have too much fatigue if you can't
deadlift for more than eight
eight or twelve weeks before your body
starts falling apart save it for the
peak
but generally speaking of strength phase
it's a very very good average idea to
include at least some of the days having
the competition lifts themselves
next up you have to target the movements
used in powerlifting specifically
limiting factors so here's an example
if you're rounding over in the squat
what do you use as far as a strength
movement well
a good morning is a really good movement
to use because it keeps you super
upright and it works precisely those
muscles the spinal rectors hamstrings so
on and so forth that keep you from
rounding over
so if you need more anti-rounding
strength
it's going to say erection strength but
gee whiz that has a whole other meaning
doesn't it gee where's mister
our directions are i read about him in
dad's magazines
you know 1950s kid looking through old
playboys that was my childhood
in any case you want to use sometimes
you have to have some specificity your
strength here's another one
if you need lockout strength you know a
board bench or a rack bench or something
starts to become a pretty good movement
and someone could say like well you know
what's the transfer of that to the lift
itself wouldn't you be better off doing
the lift itself like you would
unless the lift itself is really just
turns into a grinder at the top every
time and it bounces off the chest like
crazy
you might actually make yourself
stronger on average by limiting how much
fatigue you generate here
keeping your muscles fresher starting
here locking out it's better overall
it doesn't have to be all you do so one
day of the week if you really need help
with lockouts one day of the week
you do a bunch of partial lockout stuff
and a little bit of full pressing and
the other day of the week in which you
press you do only full pressing that
means it brings up your lockout slowly
but you still get that general work and
that general practice that makes you
good at the lift itself
really really cool combo to try high
stimulus to fatigue ratio so if you have
exercises that really just beat you up
and you don't even feel like you're
producing a ton of tension in them stop
doing them
a good example is some people try to
experiment with like ultra wide sumo
and they just feel pain in their hips
and the load is really low and they
don't feel a ton of tension anywhere
this fucking sucks if you can't produce
a ton of force or if it beats up your
joints way too much more than an
alternative
don't do it like some people actually
high bar squat most of the year
because low bar squats are really
specific but have a crazy low stimulus
fatigue ratio because they fucking beat
up all of your joints
if that's the case just put them in
sparingly towards the peak that's
probably a better idea
lastly as far as movement diversity in
the hypertrophy lecture
we talked about having movement
diversity not just doing the same stuff
all the time but you know one of the
days having more close grip stuff one
other day's more wide grip
in strength you want a little bit of
diversity but you want most of that
diversity to start coming
from repetition ranges rather than
coming from
movement variations so you may actually
just pick one
benching variation or a dominant one
that you do both days same exercise
but on monday you might do sets of three
or four
and on friday or on thursday or whatever
next time you bench
you might do sets of five to six still
variations still dup bro
but it's now uh the exercise variation
is lower
you can consolidate the actual stimuli
to get you good at that very one thing
you say what about all the variation
stuff that's for hypertrophy
variation reduces as you get closer to
peaking when you're peaking shit you'll
have almost no variation at all so in
strength we start to constrict things
can you still do different exercises
sure just make sure
you're not doing so much that you're not
getting a very good at any one specific
thing and what specific thing is that
it's whatever transfers really well to
the competition lift
including the competition lift itself
good place to start
super easy is the competition lifts
themselves
right so if you're like fuck what
exercise do i pick that meets all these
low bar squat competition bench whatever
your deadlift setup is for competition
start there super simple as you become
more advanced
you may find better alternatives but if
you don't know but if you're more
advanced you probably know the answer to
all these questions by now
so if you're a beginner if you're an
immediate you're trying this stuff for
the first time just start with lift
themselves keep it simple and you'll
notice like man when i do highbrow
squats shit just goes way better than
what i do low bar
then it's not lifts themselves for you
in the answer maybe in strength phase
one of two strength phases you could do
high bar squats and then only do low bar
squats and strength phase two
so on and so forth example
some pauses in there some competition
stuff you guys can check that out uh
pause the video if you like
what about loading range well basic
strength is usually best
engineered in the three to six rep range
okay
you can in your assistance work and you
guys see some assistance exercises in
there to support the the muscles that
aren't getting a ton of work
from the core lifts you can get up to 10
repetitions that's totally fine even 12
on occasion
but don't do that shit with the main
moves the main move should be in the
three to six rep range because your
number one goal is increasing strength
right and this is especially true you go
into high rep ranges if your stimulus to
fatigue ratio is that much better so if
you're doing upright rows for shoulders
sets of three to six you're like this is
stupid my shoulders hurt if you do sets
of eight they feel way better and
everything is
groovy then you're good to go right of
course
always or almost always never say never
justin bieber you want to do your main
moves first
your main competition moves the ones
that really make you strong in that 360
rep range
assistance moves that are lighter go
later right standard standard protocol
example with rep range just filled in
you'll notice a little bit of dup going
on in there if you really pay attention
so go ahead and pause and figure that
out
relative effort rpe is dominant in
strength training because rar doesn't
really make any goddamn sense
okay if you hit your three
a set of three reps at three rir
is that what is that how the fuck is
that really possible like
that means you could have hit six or
something like that
and then it really gets quite confusing
so you know the low disparities get
really crazy
and you know a hard triple and an easy
triple
might be the same reps in reserve but
the weight is really different between
the two
rpe really is critical at this point to
start using
it's an rp scale of one to ten seven
eight nine is where you mostly train
you know four to six is where you deload
again you want to start
on that lower end that gives you the
easy gains builds momentum reduces
injury risk you don't want to start
a strength program a fucking rp 9.5 rp7
week one it's not exactly our p7 but
around that and seven is a really good
guess
and then of course you choose loads that
are your best guess of what
rpe seven looks like in week one and
because you just finished
a hypertrophy program that had sets of
five to ten
an intelligent hypertrophy program will
actually in the second part of itself
will have more like sets of five to
eight usually if you've just done
hard sets of five to eight in similar
exercises man you know figuring out sets
of three to six
isn't that hard figuring out the load is
not that hard
but there's a little guess and check and
that's totally fine you can always
adjust
later sets if you're really off
examples with sample weights if you do
this program please don't do the weights
for beta unless you're exactly this
strong
right all right initial volume selection
so
you want to do enough volume in the
first week to
feel a considerable drop in strength for
the target muscle and movement
okay you want to feel like you had a
pretty decent workout that's how we know
overload is being applied
if you have to reduce the load to
continue to hit your target reps
at your target rpe by more than about
five to ten percent
then you're done okay and that between
five and ten percent it
depends on the individual depends on
much other stuff uh but
you know if it's over ten percent you
probably for sure done probably not for
all people
but for some people even approaching any
load reductions like if they do
you know three hundred pounds for five
three four hundred for five
and then they do 300 and they're like uh
this is getting to be an rp8 and not a
seven
they might need to shut it down but
generally speaking you don't want to
take like
a bunch of drop sets end up doing 200
for fives when you start at 300 and be
like oh i still haven't reduced
you know my my performance is still good
it's only down by you know 50 percent
fi anything beyond five to ten percent
is way way overkill
in especially uh in the first week when
you start and that's very easy to figure
out
now on them that's on the sort of
minimum side
on the top side you don't want to get
super super sore so that you're still
sore when you're training next time and
you don't want to get so fatigued
that your performance deteriorates when
you can't have another good workout so
if monday you squat and then thursday
you squat again
what you don't want is monday to be so
much shit that thursday you're either
still sore on the quads
or your quads aren't sore but you're
weak and you don't feel like you can
squat heavy you don't hit these little
mini pr's on which all of training is
based
so my biggest recommendation
is start on the lower end of volume
start here not there
so that if you know you really
push it you know not hard enough and
you're like that workout was too easy
you can always make the next workouts
harder
what you can't do is once you have a
workout that's too hard the extra
fatigue is there
right the extra fatigue it's like um
pouring milk into a bowl or into a glass
if you pour just not enough milk you can
always pour more milk in
but if you pour too much milk the shit
goes everywhere your cat comes in and
it's like wow
and you're like you can't have any milk
kitty and he's like wow
he scratches your eye out you have to
wear a patch for the rest of your life
crazy shit
in any case if you're in the real world
and you're doing like sets of five
and your last set of five that you did
you're not really sure
you could target rpe is seven but you're
like oh was that set like a fucking
seven or an eight that last one was a
little tough i think it was a seven
maybe it wasn't eight
shut it down shut it down first week
shut it down in your last week
you could be like fuck it let's do
another one in your first week be
easy that's absolutely the best idea
right you can always move up later if
it's not enough
example of initial volume selection is
this example only don't try this
verbatim
you can try this verbatim just don't be
stupid and follow all the landmarks we
talked about
folks that's it you
can can now you have all the tools to
design your own strength program for
powerlifting
next week we focus on executing or
i pronounce that weird executing that
program and progressing through it
to make sure that you're adding load
every week and actually going through
the process
of getting stronger that is why the next
week is going to be
powerlifting progression we'll see you
for that next video and a reminder
we have two videos left after that
peaking program design
peaking progression at the end of that
process you'll know everything there is
to know about powerlifting
you'll be edcone guaranteed after this
next video
see you then
