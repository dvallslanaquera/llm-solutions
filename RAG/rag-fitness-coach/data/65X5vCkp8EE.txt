[Music]
hey folks
dr mike here with jared feather you may
recognize him from
other youtube things and kyle
who is a physique athlete and not that
smart of a person because he volunteered
for jared and i to torture the living
shit out of his chest and triceps
here we go the workout is called
antimatter
why i'm not sure he might explode and
decimate the entire universe afterwards
we're gonna be starting with barbell
bench press then we're gonna be doing
incline dumbbell
press then dumbbell skull crusher super
set to dumbbell bench
and then a mile rep drop set thingy with
push-ups at the end
about five four to five sets on average
for each exercise but we're going to
auto regulate
that let's get into it and see
when kyle dies
[Music]
so folks remember even when we display
the working sets
we're really making sure to warm up
which means
oh between two and five warm-up sets
before every single exercise early in
the session
like the bench press the first one we
warm up with like you know multiple
warm-up sets pyramiding the weight up
and the repetitions down and then for
all the other exercises i'm gonna do one
or two warm-up sets
just to get the feel of the movement
because generally we're warm so don't
just look at this workout and think oh
it's these sets
warm-ups are not included they add sets
they don't add stimulus
but they help you warm up so that you're
safe and maximally effective
so we're gonna start out with the
barbell bench press
that's going to be sets of roughly five
to ten reps
this is gonna be heavy work to stimulate
primarily the faster twitch muscle
fibers
because that's when they're fresh at the
beginning of the workout in
almost every case for almost every
muscle group at the beginning of the
workout we start training our heaviest
and then we get incrementally lighter as
we go because it's possible to do a real
good job heavy first
not really the other way around if you
train light first and get tired you
can't go heavy later and there's some
things light training
just can't do so barbell bench press
compound hardcore movement
multiple sets of five to ten reps this
is a peak week this gentleman has
suffered
all the way through a mesocycle so
everything is going to be either one rep
in reserve
zero reps in reserve or all-out failure
let's go
lock it out one more let's go control
control and false
yeah push go go go go go go go go one
more
we got you no worries do your best
oh yeah oh yeah grind grind grind grind
grind grind go
good job good stop
excellent
[Music]
good
[Music]
go go go go go go press press press
press
all right we did not rest long enough
jared what do you think
executive decision down set
or rest longer so
kyle went all out and got nine reps on
his first set
we rested about two minutes then he only
got three reps
ish on a second not a problem
but we have to make an executive
decision we could rest longer or
in order to get at least five reps per
set which is sort of a hypertrophic cut
off generally
we could do a down set and do a little
bit
less weight to get a little bit more
reps we're gonna try the downside just
to show you guys what that looks like
usually rest long enough that you get at
least five reps per set but if that's
not possible
you might be so tired that no amount of
respects is that short of doing another
session
then it's a good idea to do downside
usually you drop the weight oh
10 to 20 or something like that we'll
see how that works
up and back there you go five beautiful
[Music]
six excellent at least one more
there it is good no bullshit good
control
yes awesome rap
good stuff
so we finished three sets of barbell
bench press
five to ten reps per set now we're on to
incline dumbbell press
again for chest the movement for
dumbbells we want a little bit more
quality control
we can't use ultra heavy dumbbells
because dumbbells are not stable enough
to actually press with super high forces
and high loads so we want the 10 to 20
rep range
with dumbbells which means we pick a
load that starts somewhere in the 10 to
20 reps you can be anywhere we're gonna
be shooting for roughly 15 reps in the
first set
and then we're gonna let fatigue chop
off our sets to go all the way
way down to as low as about five reps
not the goal
but each set is going to be really close
to failure let's do it
but really expand and touch the outside
of your effects with the
dumbbell up same thing go pause
push all the way up walk out there you
go slow
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
there you go good reach reach that chest
beautiful open up the chest
excellent that was the best one
[Music]
kyle you got one more at least
[Music]
control control control and that's it
good folks
when you finish a rep of almost anything
especially if you're a spotter or if
it's dumbbells
and you can't do another rep that's a
good time to really milk the eccentric
extra slow and then dump the weight when
you finish don't just jump it off
you have an awesome ability to put in
half of a
really muscle growth stimulating rep
really mess up your muscles
while they're at their breaking point
it's a real good idea
so as soon as you're done don't skimp
make sure to control the eccentric
and then drop it off
[Music]
all right folks that's it for incline
dumbbell press now we're switching
to some chest but more triceps kyle is
gonna do
a dumbbell skull crusher superseted
to a flat dumbbell press super set
technique for triceps works super well
there's a chance you're gonna drop the
dumbbell on your face but hey that's
life
let's get into it so when kyle is down
here he's gonna grab the dumbbells and
there are basically two ways you can do
a dumbbell skull crusher
uh one is in the neutral position so
this way more pronated you're going to
be here and you can go down this way
or if you want to take it like a barbell
and skull crush this way
whichever one feels more comfortable for
your shoulders and your elbows is just
fine
and very similar stimulus
and touch the dumbbells lower on your
shoulders fight those elbows into
there you go
[Music]
good touch the top of your shoulder not
the front deeper
yeah there you go
touch here
[Music]
big lock out one more
slow take your time to lock it out no
rush
lock and then press right away
go three you got two more this is
lightweight
up good
up good one more come on let's go down
yep
full lock out all the way to the full
and hold it again
all the way to the full and hold it go
one more
keep them in close together close
together close together big press
go go one more listen failure training
is not for motherfuckers let's go up
lock it out more
slow press go go go
go go go go oh shit one more
you got it you got it you got it control
go
you sucked up for this go go go
go yeah good enough and slow
and rock good job
kyle it's nothing personal it's not
good stuff man come on you can lift it
all right folks kyle here says he can do
40 to 50 good technique push-ups
fully rested but he's not exactly going
to be fully rested
push-ups are the last thing on the menu
let's see how close to 40-50
he actually gets
[Music]
the deal here is about four mile rep
sets of push-ups which means
he's gonna rest roughly five maybe ten
seconds at the most between sets
and that's the plan he might end up
getting like one one one if that's the
case we're gonna give him
a few more minutes to collect himself
and then do some more sets four total
sets
ideally rapid fire but if not no big
deal if you're getting less than
five reps per set you gotta rest longer
the push-up only counts
under three conditions one your ass and
dick are not touching the floor
the entire time you're not doing these
lockout push-ups with your dick still on
the floor
that's condition one condition two your
chest must touch the ground gently
every single time condition three is you
have to lock the elbows out completely
every single time your body like a rigid
plank
let's find out how things go
oh that is beautiful
good
oh yeah
good keep that butt up
good one more
push
now get on your knees knees and then
knee pushups go right now
and up one control beautiful and up
to control
up up up that's it
rest sometimes you're so fucked up that
you can't do any more normal push-ups
that's okay you can superset right to
knee push-ups
it gets you more volume closer to
failure tons of pump
tons of metabolites it's real great
stuff if you can still do five reps plus
of regular push-ups you don't have to
worry about the knee push-ups but
sometimes you did such a great job
stimulating your chest and triceps
beforehand
that you are total toast and it's
totally fine to do them off the knees
[Music]
control
good
good
good control
oh my god you're the fucking man one
more slow
big push go go go go go yeah that's it
that's it
all right let's get at least three here
off the knees
one
two rest rest breathe
last one
good job that's it very good
very good good news bad news good news
kyle is a fucking warrior and did
everything he could
bad news he's out of juice and can't
even do five
knee push-ups anymore so we're going to
call an audible real quick
we are going to switch gears and throw
him on for one last mega
crazy psycho maya rep set on a bench
press machine
where he can create very low resistance
to get more repetitions this is not
something you commonly do
sometimes you can zig when you should
have zagged in the workout to get a
slightly better stimulus
the last thing we're doing for today he
is incapable of providing any more
stimulus after this
let's get after it lock excellent
again lock let's go excellent three more
yes once come on
lock it out lock it two last one
big lock good slow
and that's it
[Music]
[Laughter]
awesome folks huge props to kyle over
here
holy shit did he try
went to failure a bunch that was awesome
jared and i would never be able to
survive a workout like that because
we're not that tough
luckily he is if you want to try this
workout out
work up to it over time start with just
a few sets
three reps shy of failure add a little
bit of weight every week add a few reps
every week add a couple sets every week
about
four to six weeks later you should be
going all the way to failure with
multiple sets and reps
deload repeat folks give it a try at
home and if you can't use your arms or
chest afterwards
sorry we bear no liability for such
things see you next time
[Music]
you
