in an isolation exercise more or less
all the load is distributed to the
isolated muscle group such as the
triceps in a skull crusher
compound exercises contrastingly are
more complex as two or more muscle
groups are actively involved in a
barbell bench press the nervous system
of one individual may distribute 40
percent of the total load to the
pectoralis major
40 percent to the triceps and 20 percent
to the anterior deltoid of course this
is oversimplified for illustrative
purposes in reality bones tendons
synergistic and stabilization muscles
also bear the load to varying degrees
throughout an exercise
nevertheless
is it possible for an individual to
change how their nervous system recruits
the muscle groups involved in a compound
exercise
using our oversimplified example
could the person alter their barbell
bench press recruitment patterns for
example such that the anterior deltoid
now handles 40 percent of the load the
pectoralis major 20
and the triceps 40 percent
a fascinating study by stransker and
colleagues gives us potential insight
i will use the author's terms and
interpretations to describe the study
however there are notable limitations
and considerations with this study so
for those interested please watch until
the end to understand what i feel to be
the best interpretation of the current
evidence
27 men with an average barbell bench
press of 105.2 kilograms were recruited
all subjects could bench at least 120
percent of their respective body weights
during two 4 second maximal isometric
barbell bench press contractions
performed with their elbows flexed to 90
degrees and the upper arm perpendicular
to the floor
and three reps with an eighty five
percent one rep max load on the barbell
bench press
surface emg which stands for
electromyography recorded muscle
activation from the pectoralis major
anterior deltoid and triceps
for each subject the researchers noted
out of the pectoralis major triceps and
anterior deltoid which one displayed the
lowest relative activation on the bench
press tests
resultantly
three groups were formed
those with the lowest relative anterior
deltoid activation the anterior deltoid
group
those with the lowest relative
pectoralis major activation the
pectoralis major group and those with
the lowest relative triceps activation
the triceps group
then subjects went on to perform
targeted isolation training for their
respective lowest activation muscle
performing three exercises per session
each for four sets of 10 to 15
repetitions to failure three times per
week for six weeks
the anterior deltoid group trains the
upright row lateral raise and front
raise
the pectoralis major group trained
dumbbell flies machine flies and cable
chest flies
the triceps group train barbell skull
crushers cable overhead extensions and
incline skull crushers
note
all three groups also perform three sets
with a four rep max load on the barbell
bench press each week to ensure strength
did not attenuate
after the six training weeks
all three groups similarly increased
bench press warner at max strength
relevant to our discussion
all three groups re-measured their
activation levels during the isometric
and eighty-five percent or one-rep max
bench press tests
to keep things condensed i'll just
present the results of the surface emg
recordings from the three reps on the
eighty-five percent or warner mx bench
press
focusing on the anterior deltoid group
first
compared to before the study
they saw a significant increase in
anterior deltoid relative activation
with a concurrent significant decrease
in pectoralis major and triceps relative
activation
the pectoralis major group compared to
before the study
saw a significant increase in relative
pectoralis major activation with a
significant decrease in triceps and
anterior deltoid relative activation
finally the triceps group compared to
before the study
saw a significant increase in relative
triceps activation with a significant
decrease in pectoralis major relative
activation and a non-significant change
in anterior deltoid relative activation
stated another way
this study indicates performing
exclusive targeted isolation training
for a certain muscle group ultimately
increases its relative activation during
a compound exercise
with a corresponding decrease or
negligible change in the other involves
muscle groups
however as alluded to limitations and
problems exist
notice i've implied surface emg measures
and muscles activation
this is not actually accurate
instead
surface emg approximately measures
neuromuscular excitation which is when
neurons transmit electrical signals to
the muscle fibers it innervates
muscle activation actually refers to
when the contractile units are prepared
to generate force
for those with some muscle physiology
knowledge it's when calcium binds to
troponin to enable subsequent
cross-bridge cycling
the problem here is intermediate steps
between neuromuscular excitation and
muscle activation exist
such that it's not sensible to consider
them in complete unison
so
surface emg approximates neuromuscular
excitation
however
notice i've said approximates i say this
because research has found when actual
neuromuscular excitation is kept
constant
manipulating the length of a muscle or
joint angle produces different surface
emg recordings
in other words
surface emg still does not truly record
a neuromuscular excitation
the second problem is how the
researchers measured and interpreted
their surface emg recordings
when presenting the results earlier
notice how the recordings of each muscle
are expressed as a percentage of a
maximum isometric contraction
the researchers calculate this by first
recording the surface emg response to
holding a maximum isometric attraction
for each respective muscle group
these respective values are then used to
normalize the surface emg response
recorded during the 85 or one rep max
barbell bench press
let's use an example with the triceps to
make this crystal clear
imagine during the shown maximal
isometric triceps contraction
100 units were recorded from the triceps
by surface emg
during an eighty-five percent water at
max barbell bench press we recorded 85
units from the triceps as a result
we say the triceps produced 85 of its
maximum isometric contraction
the problem here is we're basing the
triceps relative contribution to an
exercise on a random isometric
contraction
it's entirely possible if a different
triceps isometric contraction was used
to normalize our values we would obtain
a vastly different relative activation
level
for instance
if a different triceps isometric
contraction generates 150 units from the
triceps
our 85 units measured from the triceps
during the barbell bench press would
have only equated to a 57 maximum
isometric contraction
based on all of this information you
would see it's not really sensible to
compare maximum isometric contraction
values between muscles
just because in a certain exercise
one muscle generates a higher percentage
of a maximum isometric contraction
compared to the percentage of maximum
isometric contraction achieved by
another muscle
we cannot definitively say that muscle
is truly activated or involves more
simply because those percentages are
based on arbitrary isometric
contractions
the thing is the researchers did this
for example
we know those in the anterior deltoid
group were the subjects that before the
study
experienced a lower percentage of the
maximum isometric contraction of their
anterior deltoid compared to the
percentages of maximum isometric
contractions of the pectoralis major or
triceps during the bench press tests
the researchers interpreted this as
saying that anterior deltoid was the
lowest relative activated muscle for
these subjects
but the fact is
based on what we've described the
equipment and methods used were simply
not adequate to truly say this
despite these notable limitations and
problems i still think this data holds
value for two reasons
firstly the consistency of the findings
is noteworthy
after performing targeted isolation
training for a muscle that muscle saw
increased emg recordings during the
bench press
the anterior deltoid group saw elevated
anterior deltoid emg recordings the
triceps groups were elevated triceps emg
recordings and the pectoralis major
group saw elevated pectoralis major emg
recordings
secondly
surface emg recordings were compared
within the same individual that
performed the same exercise with the
electrodes placed at roughly the same
spot
this does likely attenuate potential
limitations with muscle length joint
angle and electrode positionings
combining these two reasons and i think
this study by schronske and colleagues
potentially does suggest
if an individual performs targeted
isolation training for a muscle its
recruitment may be increased during a
compound exercise
yet
several questions remain
as some examples the subjects performed
quite high volume targeted isolation
training
they executed 36 weekly sets for their
targeted muscle
could the same results be achieved with
the lower weekly set numbers
we also know the subjects performed
exclusive targeted isolation training
for their specific muscle while ceasing
training of all other muscle groups
could the same results be obtained by
continuing to train all your muscle
groups by increasing the volume with a
muscle you want to recruit more during a
compound exercise and decreasing volume
on the muscle or muscles you wish to
remain similarly or less activated
during that compound exercise
ultimately higher quality data is
unquestionably required to fully uncover
the precise details and nuances
