all right folks welcome back happy
holidays dr mike
dr james this is time we're in person
how about that
how about it we're in montana and we are
answering your
ridiculous questions bye now hopefully
all you guys know the hypertrophy book
has come out and i already saw there
were some hypertrophy book questions on
this one so make sure you guys check
that out
so we're just gonna go ahead and get
started and get right into question and
by the way james is sitting no further
than me
from the screens so he is in fact twice
my size gigantic
especially in my head
what shall i read yeah let's get to it
asks hi docs i'm reading the raw
stimulus management section of my
personal book
the ranking scale for qualifying muscle
disruption is the same as quantifying
pump basically how much pump did you get
in the target muscle
is that an editing error yes
yes it is it must be uh i don't think
that's how it was
done
we're going to take a picture of that
and we're going to send it to our editor
and see if she can find
the same thing
i don't remember i don't think it was
written that way well certainly wasn't
intended that way
yeah there's a lot of cutting paste uh
errors
yeah a lot of little insight for any of
you ever have any ambitions of making a
book
sometimes you will have the text looked
at a thousand times and then the actual
errors come from when you are putting it
into book format which is
one of the reasons that it ended up
taking a little bit longer than we had
hoped
and then he says i may be totally
lapsing on something here but i was
under the impression that muscle
destruction is just about
perturbation soreness and local fatigue
no exact exactly correct
can't imagine this ultra minutiae stuff
getting uh
voted imagined it turns out it was the
most uplifted one
but anyway i decided to give it a shot
the book is amazing very well put
together can i recommend enough buy that
shit people
thanks it's definitely a typo we'll get
it corrected as soon as possible there's
probably hundreds of those yeah
it happens um you can only look at it so
many times and then after a while you
just don't even
they just kind of go right past you so
we'll look at it but thanks for the plug
on the book we're glad that we're uh
stoked that you're enjoying it so far
and hopefully everyone else is too
yep all right tj cool so cool tj
[Music]
hey doctors if someone is looking to get
a personal training certification which
one would you recommend
my best answer is the one that your gym
will allow you to train people with
um and consider you certified and the
cheapest one of those is probably the
best
because mostly you're going to learn all
your stuff through experience and
through resources like rpe 3dmj
stuff like that yeah i mean all the
personal training certificates
um most of them are a dime a dozen
there's
really only the few that are like
nationally recognized at least on the
really grand scale
off top of my head you know nsca acsm i
think nasm those are ones where if you
have them
pretty much everyone recognizes them but
ultimately it's whatever job that you
want to get which one are they looking
for
and then after that it's kind of a
racket because they just hit you up with
ceus and renewals and
god it's pain in the ass i've let all of
mine laps and i've had several over the
years um just because
frankly they're pain in the ass and they
don't really provide any additional
credentials for me anymore
now if i was to go back into academia
and they said
you need to have your cscs i'd be like
kicking myself a little bit going i used
to have it and i let it lapse but now i
need it again for sure shit
but other than that meh
hey doctors i have been an overweight
elderly man for it seems like forever i
would like to finally turn
a new leaf next year for some time now i
have followed your excellent work and
have attempted
to implement many of your methods with
little success i consistently apply your
rir method
leading one to three reindeer in reserve
for each set is that like a christmas
joke i think so
i hope this whole joke isn't about uh
santa claus this would be highly
disappointing
to read i suppose it is the animals
usually seem to get tired
while they get no pump foots over for
our workouts are generally programmed
deadlifts
sled pushes and pulls and battle ropes
attached to moving
steeds one issue may lie with the sfr
the exercises typically perform i can't
seem to get an ideal
snow to frost ratio and my sled poles
become bogged down by slasher terrain
i wonder if part of the problem is my
exercising scheduling i currently have
one full body workout followed by 364
days of rest
each year i've thought of changing the
five workouts per week but i'm worried
this could confuse my clients
another non-paying clients i'll have you
add another potential issue could be my
diet
which is just entirely sugary
confections and milk this is terrible
it's pretty anabolic
i think of including more meat as i have
access to a steady supply of venison
where i live it's fucked up
and i'm wary of stale cookies and
spoiled dairy products in any case
what are your thoughts how i should
modify my workout schedule exercise and
diet so i can
move to the topics tropics and wear
swimsuit when i retire
i appreciate your webinars immensely
thank you for time and help ps
dr james you should you show good
potential to take over my business when
i retire your birds of the highest
caliber
dr mike i have an issue with the
undersized mischievous employees
and need an intimidating but gentle
hearted manager
please send a letter to my residents if
interested unfortunately all
hats are compulsory i understand this is
a deal breaker so i'm actually a
terrible manager
uh i'm more of a creative than a manager
but um what you should do is just uh
over the course of two injections move
up to three and a half grams
of trend per week geez and all your
problems
currently that you have will be solved
and many more will be created
do you ever think that santa is involved
in slavery and or
person elf human trafficking whatever
you want to call it the atf shows up
the elves are in the factory like anyone
who wants to leave can do so now
voluntarily
i was like drops the floor i see i told
you they wanted to be here
that was good that was pretty good earth
savior is back
thank god thank goodness earth savior
says my gym is likely to close again due
to coven
i'm like am i likely to lose
much muscle if i cut whilst training at
home using predominantly compound
exercises yes
my leg workout will be made up of high
bar squats front squats and or
closed down squats since i won't have
access to hack squat as i won't be able
to do pull-ups
the closest thing you can do as far as
vertical back movement is dumbbell pull
over however
i have enough weight to perform all my
other usual exercises
uh ideally i'd wait until the world is
covered free but i'm tired of being a
fat piece of shit
my concern is that my workouts will
consist mostly of compounds i won't be
able to wrap up volume
in the 10 to 20 and 20 30 rep range
anywhere near as much especially with
legs and lats
so i think you can do it you have an sfr
issue and a targeting
specificity issue if you can't do a lot
of vertical pulling it might cost you a
little bit of muscle
unlikely but it's definitely a concern
and then the sfr thing is a big deal
and in addition to that the redundancy
of exercise angles
so for example i sustained what ended up
being a really really annoying
like additional sartorius strain
um that is still bothering me about a
year
half a year later coming up on
nine months now uh it's workable but i
got it through
doing so many hip hinges and bent rows
because the only thing we could do
because we were training at home
that it fucked me up like seriously so i
would be pretty careful with that
and maybe you could maintain for a while
and just get strong at home
and then wait until gyms are open
to start fat loss phase or maybe you can
just maintain for a month or two and
then start a fat loss phase and only do
half of it
at home and then half at the gym so
yeah i i feel your pain i've had several
clients like like a couple that were in
the uk where they
like we're on lockdown and they're not
unlocked down on lockdown again and i
don't like them australia as well a lot
of the commonwealth
i think are struggling with that so
there is kind of like
how long are you willing to let it go
for right because
it's not an ideal situation to train in
in terms of like having the best
training
you know minimizing muscle loss stuff
like that but at the same time like
how long are you willing to just push
these things off you know indefinitely
it's
it's hard to say so at some point you
just got to kind of have to do
what you got to do and make the best of
it and you just go if you decide to go
through with a cut at this point
just know that like your training is not
going to be the best it's not going to
be the best cut that you ever did
can you lose weight and get a little bit
leaner sure are you going to lose a
little bit extra muscle than you
normally would probably but the good
news is like that can be remedied later
on
so you can push it off and just do
maintenance and just say i'm going to
wait until i have a much better
situation
or if you've been doing that for a while
and you have no idea when it's going to
get better then
just go for it and know it's not going
to be the best one that you've ever done
and that's probably okay
yeah by the way yordan sanjiv
the books have been updated already a
while ago you can redownload the copy
with its most recent
with the most fixes just by going to
your rp portal where is where you got it
before
yeah we uh have somebody on it so
whenever there was an error that was
reported they were
rapid fire fixing them yep right off the
bat so
take a look and maybe that version has
been updated
all right
huh this is a big one it's a doozy
set i was like where is the subject and
verb
samuel turner asks says
leo rex ex-arm wrestler and now expert
in human well-being and longevity
says after 50s most people suffer from
chronic pain
so should avoid heavy squatting
deadlifting in brazilian jiu-jitsu in
their younger years
do you agree i'm in this journey for
health how would you avoid chronic pain
later in life
the most easy guarantee of chronic pain
later in life is inactivity earlier in
life
so if you make yourself strong but do it
intelligently
don't get hurt heavy squatting
deadlifting and doing jiu-jitsu all the
time
jiu-jitsu is a trade-off i think it's
probably about 50 50 good versus bad
for longevity um squabbing and dead
lifting heavy is really really good for
longevity
if you do it safely mind your technique
all the time sfr rir
all those things if you squat and
deadlift like a fucking retard then
absolutely will get you into deep shit
and then you won't just have
painful joints in your later years
you'll have them now
yeah so yeah just do things smart and
actually inactivity is the worst
possible choice
so like there's an easy case that you
can make that is like if you are a
knucklehead
and just squat deadlift to your shit
your pants like a lot of programs would
have you do
then yes that could lead to all sorts of
chronic problems later on
but what dr mike is saying if you do
reasonable training like you're training
within your volume landmarks you're
conscious of your technique you're
conscious of sfr choices and all the
like
those things are absolutely going to
help you live a longer and higher
quality of life it's been shown that
resistance training does help improve
not only the length of your life but
your independence into old age
and your ability to sustain injuries and
not die from them
all sorts of really funny things like
your your total like uh
mortality and morbidity goes down from
resistance training and it goes from
simple things just like
being able to wipe your butt when you're
older by yourself or if you get hit by a
bus like you're not going to die
sure or you're less less severely
injured things like that
so i don't agree with that like you can
always make the case of like well if
you're real stupid then doing these
things are going to hurt you well like
yes but that's
really not the point it's a separate
issue any sport so he gives jiu jitsu as
an example
you could say the same thing about any
sport any sports gonna leave you
with potential tennis will fuck you up
yeah
like you don't go into doing sports with
especially contact sports
with the with health in mind it's a
trade-off it's an
activity that you like that's going to
shave potentially
some of the years off of your life or
maybe even uh
some of the activities that you could do
like nobody joins rugby thinking like
this is going to make me healthy
right it's like i have issues that i
need to get out and rugby is the other
thing
the productive way of me doing that
right like without being a burden on
society
so i think with any sport particularly
combat sports
uh and contact sports in general um you
do it because it's something that you
enjoy there's a skill that you get out
of it you know there's fulfillment that
you get out of it there is like
fitness and in some cases aggression
that you can uh
satisfy but it's not necessarily
if you are already doing like some type
of cardio some type of resistance
training like you're not getting a whole
lot of extra health benefit on top of
that from the extra sport activity so
like
do your cardio do your strength training
that covers your health sports
is up to you and what compromises you
want to make
and caldwell asks how do you recommend
hypertrophy training specifically for
the lower
and middle abs my body fat is low enough
to see the whole six pack but the bottom
four abs are very small
compared to the top two and my mind
muscle connection
is and even the simplest ab movements
frustratingly
come and go with just about every
session i am desperate for help
thanks well so first of all you probably
want to do a lot of movements where
you're moving the legs
instead of the torso so you uh can do
some hanging leg raises
you basically tie weight to your feet
and then you bring your knees
up to touch your chest i know that
sounds hard it is
maybe start with no weight eventually
you can do straight leg hanging leg
raises
and so on and so forth uh if you look at
the uh renaissance periodization
youtube has actually an exercise index
for all of the muscle groups and there's
a bunch for abs
look through that most of the app stuff
trains all the abs
and uh some of it trains more of the
lower abs i will say genetics plays a
huge role in this
some people just don't have very
developed lower abs uh and
they take it all the way to the
bodybuilding stage and just something
you have to live with
and and for some people a lot of it's
just leanness too like you might be lean
and have like your top abs showing and
the only way your bottom ones are going
to show is if you get like real fucking
lean and that's just how it goes
um yeah i like um so like a couple
progressions that i have used with
people is they'll do like
roman chair either knee raises or leg
raises then you just move into like
hanging knee raises leg raises and then
sometimes we'll do
knees to chest or strict toes to bars
and then you can actually
start adding resistance to those things
those are really good even the like the
modified candle stick which is kind of
like though just like
hips up in the air movement can be
really good on the the lower to mid amps
but a lot of us just kind of guess and
check and figure figuring out what
seems to target that muscle really well
for you and where you can get a good
muscle connection training it so it's
kind of a for a lot of people it's guess
and check
all right milo wolf
you want to do this one or you want to
have some better ones how many does he
have
just two let's get oh here's a 30.
what this algorithm sucks i know all
right
i even sorted it by top henrik anderson
asks how come some muscles quads for me
have the worst sfr and raw stimulus
magnitude
in the lower rep ranges even though
they're supposedly stimulated the best
with low reps
that supposition is entirely yours or
whoever else made it it made it
falsely the bodybuilding
lay literature you see a lot of claims
that quads are actually best
trained in the 15 to 25 rep range i've
seen
very few people say that the best rsms
and especially sfrs for quads occur
in the lower up ranges so i would say
your experience actually is
concordant with that of most and then he
says
after three to four sets of barbell
squats with a pause and fairly close
stance
my quads feel disrupted to some extent
but the fatigue is really bad
if i were to do a squat jump i would
feel a bit weird on a stable but not
really that bad
on the other hand if i were to do three
to four sets of heel elevated goblet
squats
with backpack because i train in my home
gym for 20 15 to 20 reps
my legs would give out under me and i'd
go straight into the floor not actually
that bad but you get the idea
the sfr is absolutely awesome therefore
should i mainly train in the higher end
of the 10 to 20 range
maybe do two three sets of heavy work
every mesocycle
yes it seems logical to me but what does
a 16 year old know about becoming jack
well
henrik you all of a sudden a lot of your
questions make more sense
being that you're 16. i forget how young
youtube is sometimes good i could not
make such coget sentences when i was 16
good for you on a side note does this go
for all muscles yes
for example training biceps in the lower
range doesn't work for me so are heavy
pull-ups
uh enough probably yeah i would say like
if you do
pull-ups for sets of five to ten that's
probably enough bicep work in the five
to 10.
what i would say is maybe try one or two
sets every week in the five to 10 range
for biceps unless the sfr is really pure
dog shit then you could just not do that
range
thanks for the great content by the way
in norwegian and 50 russian
so i could speak russian as well boy so
i'm slightly offended that you thought
i'm swedish to norwegians they're like
the annoying cousin that you don't like
all your motherfuckers the same to us
i've been to norway several times one of
my dogs is named hammerfest
which is because hats off to norway yeah
you know
uh henrik since we know now know that
you're 16
uh i think it's fair to say that you are
probably still at the kind of
beginner st and you know training age
status and that's just because you
haven't been
alive for very long sure relatively
speaking so in that case
i would actually say like you can
definitely pick and choose
certain movements like you said like the
heel elevated goblet squats really 10 to
20 is really good for you that's great
usually for beginners and this is in the
hypertrophy book wink wink we typically
recommend you stick with the five to ten
for most things
unless you can make a good case and say
like i just don't get dick out of this
right and that's fine
um but like so for example like the
heavy pull-ups like that's probably
great like five to ten
uh on pull-ups and things like that you
might not have to do a ton of extra arm
work or like calf work or ab work just
doing those heavy compound basics
in that 5-10 rep range probably checks a
lot of boxes for you and you can
probably ride that for a long time
as you get older and you've been
training longer and you kind of switch
into that early intermediate stage
you might find your biceps don't grow
anymore from doing heavy pull-ups and
you have to start
adding more volume of direct bicep
training and yada yada kind of a classic
training age conundrums that all of us
have gone through which are extensively
covered in the book by the way
yeah so like um don't don't you don't
have to be stuck in the five to ten
ten five to ten rep range we do
recommend it for beginners but just
because it checks a lot of boxes
but you certainly can do if you if you
feel like okay my arm training or my
quad training and the example you gave
is better at
you know roughly 15 reps then yeah do it
that's great
[Music]
got an eight jacob kowalski yeah that
qualifies for sure it's good
uh overhead press touch and go versus
pause at the bottom while holding breath
versus each rep from the dead stop after
taking a breath at the bottom
pros and cons for hypertrophy and
strength which version for which
rep range so i would say the positing
and breathing a shit load is best for
lower reps definitely not higher ups
should be spending most of your time
pausing and breathing for strength it
kind of depends on what kind of strength
you're interested in and what kind of
carryover
dead stops are usually better for
strength and the rest goes to sfr
uh in your particular case some people
you try to get them to do one way and
they're like i just hate this and you
try to get them to the other way they're
like this is amazing
i guess you're just doing this way for
everything so jacob
honestly a lot of stuff try try these
based on
what i just said and what james is going
to add and then whatever works
seems to allow you to exert the most
force
get the most reps with the most good
technique while being
least discomforted that's probably your
best answer right there
it's going to be different from person
to person yeah and there might be a
specificity constraint there too so like
let's say you were training for strong
man you know then i would say like
pauses and breaths
for sure because that's exactly how
you're going to set up if you're doing
like a dumbbell or a log or a viking
press
right if you're doing it for like power
lifting or weight lifting it's really
kind of a crap shoot at that point
because you're first of all you have to
wonder like what the carryover is to
doing all this heavy pressing to
those activities like weightlifting
maybe a little bit more so but
powerlifting like meh
not really sure pause seems like a good
idea but you could make a case
for sfr in that case and then in
bodybuilding
hypertrophy training you could make a
case of just saying like
overhead pressing is stupid for me i
don't even think i should be doing this
at all
totally um and then at that point you
might find that maybe some versions are
good like you might like
seated you know in front of the face
smith machine presses or you might like
but you know behind the neck presses
whatever
and in that case it's just you follow
all the sfr guidelines like as dr mike
said
but if you're doing it for a specific
sporting purpose like
the one that's coming to mind is strong
man like that's that's a clear-cut one
for me where it's like you would do it
the way that you would probably be
pressing in competition
strong man or as i call it s m yeah
strong in man
also social social media i call s m
sometimes it is s
m sorry i mean like i know for me
personally
and i don't know if you're like this
you're a much stronger overhead presser
than i am but
for me if you pause if you're doing like
a standing or even a seated
overhead press jesus like you standing
it's out of the question i don't know
right it's like
that's the difference between getting a
set of 10 and getting a set of two yeah
because your biggest timeout is like how
much time you're spending under the bar
as soon as you rack it out you're like
it's that first rep it's that first rep
that's really hard and once you get that
elastic component going then you start
banging out reps right but if you pause
it's like you're fucking done you're not
getting any reps
all right onwards
whoa 20. lincoln and sandy
you know i got you boy i got you
fake natty says do arnold presses the
twisting motion off for any benefits
the regular vertical dumbbell presses do
not you know i suspect the answer is
almost certainly no
but if you try it and you really like
the stimulus fatigue ratio or you like
what part of your adult that seems to
target
great uh james and i probably have one
big problem with
a doctoral adherence to that exercise
which is that there is a limited
neural drive span of how much oomph you
can put into any one thing
and the more things you have to put oomf
into the more complex the movement is
the less
there is to go around since muscles grow
when you take
one or two muscles in a very
advantageous position that is safe
you put a fuck load of oomph through
them that's going to grow muscles the
most
this whole twisty thing seems to take
your mind off the
of dumbbell presses and be like but i
have to also do this
it's like telling someone when they
squat make sure to keep their tongue
glued to the roof of their mouth the
whole time like that attention span
is literally nervous system activity
from central nervous system pool
going somewhere the fuck else where it
just doesn't benefit you so unless it's
some really big advantage
to doing this shit um it's gonna it's
like well it's
because people say well it doesn't
matter like well i don't know man if you
can get three more reps with the 70s
doing them just like this and focusing
on pushing that's three reps you know
that you could have three reps of high
neural output that you could have just
never had
yeah and it's a couple other weird so
it's like
as mike was kind of alluding to right so
for if the purpose is doing it for
hypertrophy
basically taking a movement and making
it less efficient for no
no real benefit right so it's just
taking away potential stimulus for you
that you could have otherwise had
the other thing is too the twisting
movement it's unclear to me that that
does anything specific because
the the twisting movement is basically
not being resisted with the weights
right it's
the weight is going straight down right
so it's the up and down that's being
resisted by the weight at this point
you're still twisting
only against the passive resistance of
your arm now you just have a weight on
top of it right so for me it's like
you could probably find a movement like
a pec deck reverse pet deck that
actually
hits that exact movement and uh loads it
whereas this is not actually loading
that movement at all you're just making
that movement
less efficient now the last thing is on
that
you don't have to say like well i only
do arnold presses or i only do
you know palms forward presses like just
find a grip that works for you whether
it's like angled or
completely palms forward or maybe even a
little janky like i don't know if people
press like that but whatever
um you know a viking press almost uh but
like pic just pick one that's
comfortable that you can do consistently
and injury free and that's probably the
best option
boom any other big heavy hitters
got a couple threes here five five
should the calorie deficit continue
through a delayed week
we've answered this anymore
no it shouldn't you should be at
maintenance next question these are all
looks like
pretty low down here so back
up where do we leave off we got two
questions left
fast charging go up a little bit
[Music]
there we go uh diana b did we get that
one
no di mana de mona b
says hey docs kind of a weird question
as someone who's aspiring to get a
sports science degree what is the
difference between the courses of sport
physiology
sport and exercise science and strength
and conditioning
bachelor degrees they all seem pretty
similar so a lot of it right now i'll
tell you it's just nomenclature
random nomenclature that departments
decide to name shit
it's all the same those are all exercise
physiology classes pretty much anyway
yeah um at the undergrad level yeah
so sport physiology if if accurate so
we're saying first of all they're
usually not accurate
you usually just get the same education
everywhere basically
uh if accurate sport physiology is much
more specific
than the others um sport and exercise
science
can literally be like you just learned
clinical diabetes
um science symptoms and ways to get
around it
the whole time so i i i can nip this one
in the butt
all this is exercise science and
exercise physiology yeah
at the undergrad level they don't
differentiate these things yeah
so yeah you're not getting an undergrad
in strength conditioning if there's one
that says strength conditioning that
means that they have
the same exercise phys curriculum plus
like one youtube
snc class volunteers coach yes sorry
so look at the who the professors are if
they're doing good research or
uh maybe try sitting in some classes and
that's the deal yeah so the
differentiation point usually comes in
the graduate level where you go from
exercise phys stuff to now am i doing
more exercise fizz and like a more
specific niche or am i moving into sport
specific stuff and that's like a pretty
big
diverging point in most programs so i
would say
whatever programs you're looking at
they're all probably going to be roughly
the same at the
bachelor's level and then your masters
and above is where you really want to
start being more picky about those
things
creatine from team sport athletes
despair last question actually
do you have to consider the potential
weight gain from intracellular water
retention
can negate the positive effects on
performance james is all you
so i mean i would be hard pressed to say
that creatine is going to take you
significantly outside of your
optimum competition body weight
i think there are some instances
but that's really not a team sport i was
going to say like gymnastics might be an
example where that
actually could be like a tangible effect
but then again the people who do that
are generally smaller like total size
not just like saying they're
they're not muscular i'm saying they're
just generally smaller people they just
don't take that much weight from
creatine
so i don't think so and the other thing
you have to consider is that
there is a pretty big benefit in most
team sports because most team sports are
high intensity intermittent in nature
and that seems to be like one of the
biggest uh beneficial uses
of creatine is when you have like high
intensity bouts with with rest or
incomplete rest in between
now granted like you're probably going
to peter out whatever
supplemental benefit that you're taking
so let's say you take
you're having your athletes take five
grams of creatine you know a day which
is like a very normal thing
um how much is that going to carry over
into like a
60-minute sporting event like probably
not a ton
but you're probably going to have a
pretty good start and then maybe be a
little bit above where
your competition is but it's not going
to be it's not going to have a huge
carryover
um how much weight is it going to affect
you know how much is their weight going
to affect
man i have a hard time thinking that
like a few like you know two to five
pounds of water
is really going to take someone outside
of their like kind of performance
boundaries it could if you take creatine
start in the off season
see how it affects you potentially
adjust your diets your fluids your salt
maybe lose a couple pounds of fat and
then you'll be a fucking machine i just
wouldn't take creatine
you don't know how to affect you at all
i wouldn't start like the day or the
week
of your competitive season because then
you could have a couple games you were
like holy shit i'm
like getting way down here yeah back
pumps
and like i would if you are using
creatine then i would recalibrate what
your optimal competition body weight is
so then you would be scaling up and you
might say like well i'm actually
better you know at 155 pounds now i'm up
to like 162.
so now i actually need to lose that much
more fat
to be competitive and you kind of
rescale it from there
so that's how i would consider it also
just i haven't read up on the
the ncaa stuff but i think there is like
a limit on
creatine i think it is like banned to a
certain
whatever pico cramps of they can't test
that though
yeah i think it is in the rule book okay
i haven't looked at it in forever but
i just you know be aware of the rules
solution without a problem
