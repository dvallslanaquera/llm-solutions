well I'm drug free and that means I can
only gain muscle incredibly slowly I say
okay I read some stupid blog and I
realized that because I'm Natty and I've
been training for two and a half years
stop the presses I can only gain like a
pound of muscle in a year they
essentially make a plan that plans to
gain almost no weight because like why
would you gain five pounds and then lose
four pounds to only gain one pound why
not just gain like one or two pounds or
two pounds over the air don't let this
become a self-fulfilling prophecy where
you shoot your goals so low that you're
not even executing the process that
would result in your goals being
attainable if they were higher
