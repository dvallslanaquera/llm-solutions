the positive phase of the repetition or
raising of the weight should last 2 to 3
seconds the negative phase or lowering
of the weight should take close to 4
seconds to complete okay they're saying
that the Ecentric should take longer to
complete than the concentric which as a
relative rule is a very good I would
just say control the Ecentric good
technique but nice rapid concentric is
probably a little bit better of a way to
lift than going much slower the pace
they're going at is totally fine it's
going to get you Optimum results but
having to think a lot about counting the
seconds blah blah blah just go a little
slower on the Ecentric quick on the
concentric repeat and you don't have to
overthink it much more than that
