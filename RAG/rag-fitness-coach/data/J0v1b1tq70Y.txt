hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today the quick tip is you can
eat egg yolks
but dr mike
my health
how am i going to stay fitness oriented
while jamming that toxic yellow
substance down my throat to hold on a
sec
egg yolks are full of nutrients that you
actually don't find in egg whites
they have inside them a huge quantity of
ultra high quality protein actually half
of the protein in the egg is in the yolk
the only downside is that they have lots
of fats
but these fats are not specifically very
bad for your health they're not trans
fats they're actually some of them are
quite good for your health so egg yolks
generally speaking are quite neutral for
your health as far as fat profile is
concerned
and the only way that egg yolks really
affect your
diet and your health etc is they just
have way more calories than the egg
white
so if you have the calories to spare
in your meal and you want to eat real
eggs with the yolks go to town no
problem at all now egg whites are also
fine if you need to reduce the calories
and keep the protein high
and keep the fats super low or basically
to zero egg whites are also fine it's
all right answers all the way from
eating just the yolks if you're that
sort of thing
to eating regular whole eggs or to
eating you know egg whites but then i
guess in the middle there it's like you
make a mostly egg white omelet with a
few yolks that's totally fine as well
if you are eating only egg whites
because you think egg yolks are bad for
you that's just not true because they're
not they're fine the only thing you
really have to stay away from
is non-alkaline water
because the alkalinity
makes sure that the quantum energy
balance
enters your karmic
regions
in a
universally agglomeristic style that
last sentence was all nonsense
yolks are fine enjoy

eggs that no one but you knows about in
