for all the fundamental exercises that
you normally do with your techniques you
learned how to do them in such a way
that maximizes the pump not in maybe the
super heavy ones but certainly in shit
that is 10 reps and above to get the
biggest pump that you can grip positions
Etc it's okay like this I don't get a
big chest pump but like this I get a
huge chest pump like this I get a fine
chest bump but when I arch them or try
to get a big one stuff like that there
are some generalities we can talk about
but a lot of it's just individualizing
to ways in which the you know exercises
they give you the best pump and so on
and so forth and there's a lot of
technique there that figures that out
