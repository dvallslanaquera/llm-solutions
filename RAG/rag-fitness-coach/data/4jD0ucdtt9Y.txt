hey folks
dr mike isratel here for renaissance
periodization
healthy eating made simple video number
four
stabilizing meal size and number
where did we leave off last time
hopefully
you've watched videos number one two and
three from this series
make a whole lot of sense uh more sense
if you have so give those a look if you
have some time
in those videos we already established a
lot of really good stuff for
a healthy eating ability and a healthy
eating habit
first you already know how to choose
mostly healthy foods
second you know how to make balanced
meals with those foods
and lastly you know how to count the
macros in those balanced foods
in those meals and through the day so
you're
really really well on your way now it's
just a little bit of fine tuning
the next step here is to standardize the
intake
just a bit by shooting for a couple of
things mostly to do with meal structure
first is you want to shoot for a roughly
similar number of meals every day that
doesn't mean you do three meals every
day four or five every single day
but like you know maybe three to five
meals in most days is a good idea
some days you eat three some days four
some days five something like that it's
totally fine if it's all the same
but in that rough range what we don't
want you to do is eat like 12 meals one
day and one meal another day that tends
to not be really good
for habit and a lot of people that try
really variable meal schedules like that
more of them tend to fail on sticking to
a healthy eating plan because things are
just so different every time
so once you've got the number of meals
you want to eat per day
you want to eat in a relatively similar
schedule on most days now
your schedule on weekends can be quite
different from your weekly schedule and
your weekly schedule could be a little
bit different based on when you have
work when you have to pick up the kids
so on and so forth but
you want to shoot for rough times for
most of your meals at least a dependable
schedule
for example you could have breakfast at
roughly 7 a.m just an example right
lunch at 12 dinner at 6 and an evening
snack at 10.
that like roughly when you eat your
meals it's been shown that people that
have their meals relatively well planned
out or eat at roughly the same times
on average every day or so they just
tend to have better success with their
diets and they tend to eat healthy in
the long term
with just less intellectual overhead of
having to be like when do i eat today if
you know it's really really good
now you can also do yourself a huge
service
for the long term by simplifying your
meals you don't
have to do this part but it's a real big
advantage for most people what do we
mean by simplifying you choose
two to four basic options of lean
protein choices like some chicken or
some fish or some turkey something like
that
veggie combinations you know brussels
sprouts broccoli
lettuce etc healthy carbs brown rice
pasta oats uh you know maybe some fruit
options and some some healthy fats you
know
olive oil you got your handful of
almonds you got your nut butter
those are your go-to options if you
choose simple foods like that
and you put them into combinations of
course you can use more if you'd like
but if you just stick simply and if you
consider cooking and meal prepping in
bulk using tupperware
you can for a some number of meal prep
amount of effort you can get the return
that it's much more stable and much
higher
you don't have to think about it as much
you're doing a really great job with
your meals
and after bulk prepping your meals or
maybe not all of them but most of them
you got your
at least your lunches and dinners or
your breakfasts and lunches all planned
out for the week and
twice a week maybe you cook them and put
them in tupperware with the basic foods
that aren't rocket science to cook
you figure out which combinations are
tasty you're off
to an easier ability to make that kind
of eating habitual
and once it's habit someone's going to
ask you like man you eat so healthy like
you mistake a lot of willpower and
you're like willpower or just something
i do
you know like you're in the habit of
walking to your mailbox every other
morning and get in the mail it's not
exactly a herculean effort
eating healthy can be just like this if
you make it easy on yourself
shameless plug the rp diet app which is
the app that this company has made
does all this for you and lets you have
some flexibility in there too
but it's kind of like a coach that tells
you like hey you should be eating this
this this
this this this and you can choose the
foods and it automatically filters all
this through the meals and everything
it's a pretty advanced tool it's not for
everyone and it's totally cool if you go
on your
own but if you really need some help
here you just want a computer to tell
you what to do and coach you up
give that a shot terrible shameless plug
commercial right in the middle of this
informative video now
whether you use the rp diet app or not
no big deal at all the next step
once you have standardized your meal
times and how many meals you eat per day
and hopefully
have made your meals a little bit more
modular in the sense that you know
you're you know your go-to protein
sources you know you go to carbs it's
not rocket science you're not trying to
reinvent the wheel every time
at this point your daily macros
will be very similar from day to day to
day to day
versus before when you knew roughly your
daily macros but maybe they
changed wildly because sometimes you
have a big meal sometimes a little meal
this is going to be much more stable
you're getting just a little bit more
regular with your intake
you are eating enough food to have
plenty of energy and not be hungry we're
not going to
do a fat loss phase just yet and
you know really well how much food
you're eating and
because of the standardization you can
repeat and repeat and repeat that
roughly same amount of food with macros
day in and day out week in and week out
because you have
a really good flexible but
set in stone schedule that you know
right and you can always change it if
you want but because you know your
schedule it's just not a mystery what
you're going to eat the next meal
or the next day or how to prep your food
now you're now ready to manipulate your
macros scientifically
to get very precise health and
appearance results potentially
increasing your body weight
decreasing your body weight losing fat
becoming healthier so on and so forth
and you're going to be doing
that by adding in macros or subtracting
in macros from this
really awesome dependable schedule that
you've constructed for yourself you have
a meal plan now congratulations
changing it is easy that would be our
next video but our next video
is just tying up a few odds and ends
before we move in
into actually changing macros see you
next time
for the next video
you
