count them
hey folks we are back with npc super
heavyweight
philip harveston and guess what he's
very blue today
color coordinated it's very important
that's very important to be color
coordinated
especially for this psychotic dealt
workout
side delts rear delts oh and by the way
traps is a bonus round
we're only doing two exercises the first
one is of course
super rom laterals his first shot at the
title this will be really fun
and then the second one is going to be a
super set
of barbell face pulls to barbell super
high upright rows
shoulder destruction incoming he's going
to have trouble raising his arms after
this
it's going to be really fun let's get to
it
[Applause]
[Music]
exercise number one about four to five
sets
of super rom laterals the only thing the
suprarom means is usually laterals you
stop at roughly 90 degrees
these are more how much more whatever's
comfy you don't have to go all the way
up to the sky
but like oh i don't know at least
halfway up is really good because
remember the delts
are most involved in most texts from
roughly here
through that 90 all the way to roughly
here right
this is the golden zone so we're going
to use the whole thing going all the way
up
control all the way down when you do
this at home the most important thing
is of course coming up all the way but
really it's slowing them down all the
way down and using your delts you don't
want to get in the situation where
you're doing this shit
because then like yeah stops moving
around but momentum can help a lot of
this
and your adults end up kind of getting
robbed yes you will feel your traps on
this
that's okay if your traps accidentally
get too big
call 999 999 t-r-a-p it will give you
money-back guaranteed 50 days
full refund slow three more and you're
done with the set

golly
next exercise is a super set we're
probably going to do just about three
sets
he basically did like six sets of dealts
for the uh super
laterals it's kind of a lot here's the
deal
we bend over just halfway we do as many
face pulls with just the barbell as we
can
it has to clear the nose has to be above
the nose and then as soon as those are
impossible we straighten up
we do upright rows to above the eyes
keeping the elbows up and close to the
body
it will annihilate your delts if it
hurts your shoulders to do this
don't do it or modify it so that it
doesn't we don't want joint pain just
muscle pain
some people their shoulders can do this
no problem and they should be doing it
if you can't do it don't feel left out
no big deal
it's just that god made you wrong and
everyone hates you no wait wait
you're totally fine you just have to
modify the exercise
14 more more
15. let's get all the way to 20 right
