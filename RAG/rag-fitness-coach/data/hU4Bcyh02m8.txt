one little fun set everyone's having fun
today
fun times
[Applause]
hey folks dr mike here for rp
joey
christina
they are super high level bodybuilders
and they are super best friends club and
today their super best enemies club
because it's set percent war quads two
exercises only four sets it's easy right
let's get these quads going how do you
guys feel uh pretty uh not looking
forward to this
i'm ready
all right drama instant let's get to it
[Music]
lever squats pendulum squats whatever
you call them here's the deal you just
don't need a lot of weight this exercise
is brutal
huge thing is to find where your feet
are on the plate you want to make sure
that your heels are still powerfully
pressing through and your toes and your
midfoot the entire foot if you push your
feet
too far back you're going to end up
being on your toes too much not exactly
the safest thing in the world and it
actually lowers force transduction
through the legs you get less of a
stimulus if you put your feet too far up
the plate everything's good on the quad
side except your range of motion starts
to decline because you don't get as much
actual range at the joint and your lower
back starts to actually tilt on you and
that's going to start to hurt so you're
going to find a position here take your
time one that hits the heel and the toe
and keeps your lower back straight way
to control it up
one down
slow control
up
two one more slow control right now
right now slow
slow
up
press breathe don't go anywhere don't

is it the
is the back
is it your lower back
hey folks dr mike here
so we came into the gym today with joey
and christina super elite bodybuilders
and christina's workout went off super
well without a hitch
unfortunately
joey had some residual pretty high lower
back fatigue from having deadlifted just
a few days ago and he's been going
heavier and heavier in training it's
just new to deadlifting for the last
three weeks new to deadlifting for him
means he's pulling 585 for reps
and
his lower back just didn't want to
cooperate we picked some exercises at
first that were really low back friendly
but unfortunately
the uh even the pendulum squat the lever
squat
was too much pressure for his lower back
we ended up switching to do a little bit
of sort of modified sissy squats that
got the job done we were still focused
on getting kristen christina a really
really good workout we did that we
finished all of her stuff
but for joey we ended up going over to
the leg extension and doing some
bodyweight squats and some lunges
why because we wanted to do some kind of
quad workout for him today was quad day
but with minimum lower back involvement
that means we had to make a lot of last
minute changes it's not sexy it's not
very well periodized it's an on-the-fly
adjustment we ended up doing leg
extensions bodyweight squats right after
lunges right after making use of
pre-exhaust making use of my reps even
still his lower back ended up limiting
him but he got as he describes a pretty
decent session not the worst session
ever here's the lesson for you if you
come in and you have a workout you
really want to do but your lower back or
your shoulders or whatever not
cooperating you have three fundamental
choices one is keep doing the workout
that's really screwing you up don't do
that we didn't do that
that's all ego it's a dumb idea two is
scrap the workout entirely for to fight
another day totally fine choice
but we asked joe if you want to do that
he said i want to keep going so option
number three is what we did it's modify
the workout to hit the target muscle as
much as you can minimizing the limiting
factor joints and or other muscles that
are causing a problem we did that
sometimes it works great sometimes it's
good sometimes it's met if it's meh a
couple sets later if it's really not
hitting it if the back is still hurting
stop
his was decent he could keep going we
had a good stimulus for him the lesson
here is
sometimes you do what it takes be smart
about it
don't just egotistically plow through a
workout hurt your back even more and be
set back even further
right now
slow slow slow slow slow slow slow and
up
go go go that's it
fuck breathe
up
two more and you're done slow
slow

two when you're done this whole machine
is history after two
let's do it slow and controlled make
these happen
slow
slow
slow
speeds
one more
slow
slow
slow
[Music]
way to push yourself
oh my god good stuff
[Music]
so in leg press the temptation is to go
down really fast and bounce out of the
hole because you don't have to work as
hard but we're literally here to work
the quads as hard as possible which
means slow on the way down g two to four
seconds on the eccentric full pause at
the bottom and then a smooth return up
oh multiple sets of 10 to 20 reps my
reps come in really handy here
let's get the job done
you're doing amazing slow
press
six again i'm right here with you let's
go go go go go slow
control deep
press
good three more three more right away go
go go we're not resting we rest later

up
six one last one one last one slow slow
slow slow slow
up go go go go go go go go
good stuff
good stuff very very very very good take
your time take your time no rush
how are your quads feeling oh i'm just
[Music]
especially when we can't do heavy
compound movements when we need to fry
the quads here's a really interesting
strategy
extensions as many as you can
see you know 10 to 20 reps my reps is a
good idea really really fry them out as
soon as we're done here we move right
over very quickly keeping the lactic
acid in the muscles
we do as many bodyweight squats with a
slow controlled eccentric as possible
potentially really save this for when
you really need to hit
bodyweight lunges right after
also a ton that way we essentially
pre-exhaust the quads the quads of the
limiting factor on the squats and the
limiting factor again on the lunges
multiple approaches to failure
has to be necessary when you can't go
heavy and hard
yes
right away
face that way
slow ten

seven down

it's his fault you had to do all this
extra shit
i was like scared for the exercises
[Laughter]
dude good stuff that was awesome
awesome
awesome
awesome
all right folks so
joey and christina did their very very
best she knocked it out of the park
she's trouble standing right now that's
good news you saw her earlier on the
ground lying down
joey had a bit of a rough time of it
because his lower back flared up because
he did a sort of a messing cycle at
devils before this didn't agree with him
sometimes you've got to adjust on the
fly we could have canned this workout we
could have edited the shit out of it we
could have never released it but we're
showing you real life her joey's request
this is how shit crumbles sometimes yes
i agree
sometimes we try to let our egos take
over
and the important thing is to control
your ego before it controls you thanks
folks for tuning in see you next time
out
[Music]
you
