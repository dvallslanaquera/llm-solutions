researchers it can help boost
testosterone levels by up to 90 percent
in one study Yep this is what we call

all the vitamin D in the world will see
no increase in testosterone whatsoever
but every now and again people who are
vitamin D deficient see improvements in
all sorts of hormones when they no
longer become deficient but you're
probably not deficient
