decline push-ups these are brutal she's
doing them very appropriately see it
looks quite good and she's controlling
the Ecentric pretty well if she lifted
her head up she could get more range of
motion and let her chest touch the
ground these are very challenging and
not so comfortable because you have to
make out with the ground basically I
don't have anyone else to make out with
so I make out with the ground all the
time but it's pathetic and I hate myself
every time I do
it
