what about 315. yeah he's got 315.
he's strongest let's go
hey folks dr mike here jared feather
renaissance periodization we're here
with darion hill
he is four weeks out of the north
american bodybuilding show
i don't know why but he decided to say
yes we asked him to do a leg workout
with us
the leg workout is called neptunium
which as far as i know is not good news
for darion
let's see how he gets along
[Music]
all right so the workout is
two to four sets of stiff legged
deadlifts in the 5 to 10 rep range
huge overload for the hamstrings after
that
based on how darion feels we're either
going to do half squats or leg presses
he's really close to a show
we got to watch irritation on the knees
it's whatever movement fits best
that's going to be multiple sets three
to question mark
of oh 10 to 20 reps so we're going to do
them rest pause
and then after that we do another few
sets of high bar squats
probably paused again 10 plus reps each
set
total annihilation let's do it let's get
10 quality reps
get that switched around let's go
all right let's go
great one control yes
two flight tap fights after him
there it is three hips back
so many of you saw our instructional
video on trailer dallas where mike
explained why i performed the exercise
uh as you can see i think he's picking
it up first if you can and you have
the lack the flex or you lack the
flexibility you can pick it up like that
i think trying to start from the ground
really blocking very hard
and bending down grabbing the bar and
making that that first
off the floor your first rep you can
then control the last rep to kind of
complete that so
starting from the floor is a little
better but you have to pick it up first
just because you lack that flexibility
totally fine but make sure you're
pushing the hips back and on that last
the last couple inches of the exercise
you aren't bending the knees
to get the range of motion that you
think you should get
if you can't get that range of motion
you just can't get it and it's totally
fine
but don't bend the knees at the very end
of it to tap the ground because you
don't have to
just most can and you probably should if
you have that flexibility
take a break take a break darryl let's
fucking go man
three more we got this shit we got let's
go
now we're talking big chests milk out
those hams
one more let's finish up one more
quality go slow slow all the way down
slow
slow slow slow good just very good
damn goddamn
hey folks all right leg press is the
next exercise
we are going balls deep as deep
as possible now you don't want to go
deeper than what your feet can stay on
the platform with the whole foot has to
stay on the platform
and you don't want to round your back
other than that go as deep as you can
darion's going to be doing sets of 10 to
20 reps sort of
because he's doing sets of like eight to
ten reps resting three or four seconds
with some big breaths and then again and
again and again
this is a meyer rep set it's brutal
we're gonna be doing multiple sets
let's see where it goes four go
up one

darian is super super tired four weeks
out of a show
we're gonna make sure he gets all the
stimulus he can not on the heavyweight
side which is already done
we're gonna drop the weight a little bit
have him do more reps with high quality
it's a bit of a downset
potentially we'll do a drop set as well
stay tuned
and if that means you get six on that
first stress pause what the fuck ever
dude there are quality reps
it's it's getting that tension on on the
fibers it's not just repping out a bunch
of bullshit that's not how you train
that's working out people can come in
here and fucking do three sets of twelve
it doesn't matter
that's easy as fuck that's not how we
train we turn with fucking intent

the job with squats
super tough after leg presses hamstrings
are already been annihilated
so have the glutes with stiff legged
deadlifts leg press toasted the quads
now we're gonna finish the job
completely with high bar squats
probably with a pause we'll see what we
have left
