oh no
oh no temporary pain that goes away
shortly makes me huge
[Music]
yo real talk some people don't learn
they just don't
after her last workout or during and
before brie complained and complained
and complained whoa is me
guess what a couple months later she's
back at it again high volume legs she
even took it to the next level jared
feather ifbb pro is her training partner
notice by the way how many curves this
girl has that's because she's training
for her first ever physique show she's
so good at powerlifting she decided to
put that cigarette out
and then uh decided to win some
bodybuilding stuff we'll see why am i
here i already trained legs earlier but
my legs hurt and they hurt me and that
made me angry i have to express my anger
at someone and now let's see oh hey
what's up bree that's gonna be you jared
you too motherfucker so let's train
let's have fun it's high volume legs
we're gonna be doing hamstring turtles
we're gonna be doing hack squats we're
gonna be doing smith machine squats
who designed your program
three any last uh sorry any thoughts i
was going to say last words
i already hate this
[Music]
she hated it every week
it's like the worst part of my day but
it's fun i look great
everyone's fine
[Music]
come on let's go baby
come on baby we gonna get this shit yeah
seated leg curls first exercise
why leg curls first why hamstrings first
well a lot of times when you bash your
quads with a fucking hammer like with
hat squats and smith machine spots your
systemic fatigue becomes so high that
you actually can't do justice to your
hands sit down on the machine you tell
yourself i swear to god i can do this
you wake up four hours later i have no
idea love's coming out of your nose so
what we want to do is hit hamstrings
first they don't really interfere with
any of the quad movements and they don't
generate a lot of stomach fatigue so
what you're able to do in that case is
just get them out of the way get them a
real good workout move on to the rest of
quad so when you're done with quads
you're done done you'll be doing
multiple sets three to five sets i think
a slightly different number of steps for
two of them and 10 to 20 reps and these
are my match reps first set of straight
set let's say they get 15. then the next
set is however many my rep mini sets it
takes to get a sum total of 15 next time
same thing next time same thing let's do
it
[Music]
i'm batman
just kidding it's jared feather i
clearly am a little sick but today i'm
training with my new training partner
actually bree people get asked this
question quite a bit and i wanted to
just kind of touch on the subject but is
the training partner important can men
and women be training partners does the
training partner have to be the same
strength size etc so these all kind of
blend together but training partners in
themselves i think they can be very
important especially when you're in high
level
you know high level hypertrophy training
whether that be your bodybuilder you're
trying to get on stage or that maybe
you're a power lifter and i personally
block or even just a power lifter in
general because powerlifters also have
you know training partners obviously
and then even and weightlifting they
have tons of of uh partners when they're
training and they sometimes have
multiple people on a single platform but
i think that training partners
especially in hypertrophy training can
really push you to
places that you can't go on your own
a lot of us can a lot of us can just
kind of get in the zone put some music
in and really grind through a session
but even then something kind of is still
missing
so training partners can definitely be
very important in the aspect of helping
you
especially during those later weeks in
your mesocycles where you're pushing
super hard like me and briar today we're
actually in our uh overreaching week for
our mesa cycle so you're going to see a
lot of hard training today
but i kind of just want to touch on
those aspects and
you know kind of mention the importance
of a training partner if you are in this
high level hypertrophy training because
a lot of you watching the channel
definitely are you're very interested in
the
you know more nuanced concepts you watch
a lot of the educational videos so in my
next
segment here i'm going to talk about
male and female training partners and i
believe we have a video on male uh and
female uh differences as far as like
volume tolerances and things like that
so you could definitely
you know you can either pause this and
go watch that or go watch that after
this video maybe go click a link in the
bio maybe we'll put a link there or
something but
i'm going to talk about those next
rest
breathe
4
[Music]

one
two
oh yeah
[Music]
that's it
that's it
fuck
jesus christ dude
this whole four sets shit ain't it
nah i ain't with that
hack squats first quad exercise
multiple sets of around seven to ten
repetitions
enough to be very very high tension for
the quadriceps but
uh not so many that they're knocked out
for forever because after this they're
going to be doing
smyth machine squats i think that's how
you say it
let's find out what's going on oh god
this shit again
oh my god i'm mentally ill
i guarantee you those don't worry
i'll give it to you the 45's don't weigh
40.
oh yeah
[Laughter]
did you get last time
ten
ten ten nine
ten ten nine you're going to get 12 on
this first one and you're gonna do
whatever it takes to do it
are you sure this is okay dad
i first should be popping
at the bottom just a gentlest little
touch okay
[Music]
take your time to set up
[Music]
okay i'm back
still sound like shit
according to our camera he says i sound
really terrible
but i'm here to talk about training
partners some more
so
the truth behind can males and females
be training partners
is
kind of like a
almost usually not
uh to have a really good training
partner in the traditional sense of what
a training partner is they're kind of
somebody who goes through an entire
session you kind of do very similar
exercises and i mean you've seen me mike
and charlie do this in multiple videos
we're all similar experience levels
we're all the same size and strength
like relatively and we all are going for
the same goal so when we're all in
massing blocks we're all doing the same
stuff we all have similar movements that
have good sfrs for us so we're generally
doing the same things there might be
like one or two exercises that are
changing so with bree she's actually
going to be competing in what is uh the
women's physique division as you know
i'm a classic physique pro
bree's one of the strongest females to
ever exist
so
having brees a training partner is
actually really easy
we just kind of add in some volume for
her females can generally handle a lot
more volume so she'll be doing extra
sets that i'm not doing
um on our other leg day she actually has
an entire added exercise for her glutes
and hamstrings that i don't do um but
yeah those are just some of the general
differences you might see if you do end
up having a female training partner if
you're like that college guy and your
115 pound sorority girlfriend just
getting into training maybe not so much
can you be training partners but you can
definitely train at the same time help
her out give her tips from rp you know
all those great tips that we give you
and
it can definitely work that you guys
train at the same time but having a true
female male training partner
relationship where you guys are doing
the same shit it's it can be difficult
but when you have somebody like bree or
you're a relatively the same size and
experience as a female lifter and a mail
lifter it can definitely happen it can
and honestly bree pushes me harder than
most training partners i've ever had
she's a freak she's amazing females
always keep their technique in check
they train harder than men half the time
so honestly having a female training
partner like brie has been fucking
awesome she is she is absolutely one of
the best training partners i've ever had
and if you can find
you know a training partner like bri
male or female if you're a female and
you want to train with another female
like bree if you're male you want to
train a female or whatever
uh it can definitely benefit you in the
sense of you might you know have a
little bit more muscle growth toward the
end of the whole massive block because i
know i sure the hell have had one
successful massive block outside of this
shitty voice and getting sick but
yeah so i think that you can definitely
occur and it can be a benefit to
everybody
eight
slow
up
nine two more
go
[Music]
get me out of here
i'm just gonna stay here
forever
seems like an awkward place to sit
i don't know
i don't have the energy to get out
all right ready
[Music]
temporary that goes away shortly makes
me huge
fuck out of here
oh my god
oh my god
sign up for my sparking classes i used
to have to use my body to earn income
and money was good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yep yep
oh my god beautiful
yeah what's it like having jeremy
fucking sucks
zero stars
in fact he owes me money for having to
put up with this bullshit but it's all
worth it for the one compliment i get a
month
they mean a lot they need a lot that's
more than you need i know
[Laughter]
but it's always followed up by you're
still fat though
yes one down
down
three beautiful keep going
four
[Music]
five
[Music]
six rest aside
[Music]
go slow
gentle
quads
one last one go
yes free all fucking day all day
perfect
mike go back to michigan
i don't care anymore shoot
[Music]
all right so bree is going to do
smith machine squats nice controlled
eccentric nice little pause at the
bottom the feet are a little bit forward
to the machine so it can really be an
upright body position
basically a huge huge quad stimulus not
much of anything else sets of 10 to 15
reps here jared feather is probably
gonna do leg extensions because
systemically he is way too fatigued
because he actually has bronchitis right
now it's kind of amazing to zoom in here
at all
uh so
let's get it going
okey dokey
oh you're just gonna sit
i must be fucking nice i am
okay control
oh yeah one uh i honestly like having a
male as my training partner rather than
a female because i feel like i've always
excelled pretty well at strength sports
and i've always kind of been ahead of
the curve so
like it's cool it's awesome training
with another another female like don't
get me wrong it's cool we bond over shit
but there's just something so different
that like he can push me to a different
place than someone who squats fifty
percent of my max can or like
i hate to sound elitist or anything like
that but it's just
i'm not the big fish in the pond anymore
so like i have to work extra hard to
earn my keep with him and i like that
yes i love that because it's like i'm
i'll never be good enough
sure so yeah you're never going to be as
strong as you know giant male 1 exactly
but that's like motivating
troll pause up athlete shit athlete shit
rap
beautiful
[Music]
135
135
[Music]
it's like i can die on the floor but i
know no no matter how shitty i feel that
day he does not give a fuck yeah because
you get a little bit more of a
compassion yes there's no you don't want
that no i don't want emotion in it like
i don't care if i'm crying he would tell
me get the fuck up and do my set sure he
doesn't have it
yeah like i literally laugh during all
my training sessions because i'm so
fucking miserable but like i keep
showing up yeah because i've never had a
dynamic like this before and i really
enjoy it right we never push it to the
point where you're like actually gonna
get rap though yeah exactly it's like he
pushes me to the like he knows my limit
up
up
rest breathe
one
speed
up rest breathe
one
up
up
up rest breathe almost there breathe
almost there just two more reps just two
more reps just two more reps go
[Music]
it's like
hot water
being poured on my legs oh yeah
that's a that's a fun analogy
i think the only reason
why you throw up this time it's because
i'm not as fat yes
there's not as much like food in
yourself
[Music]
there you go jared
[Music]
you've trained with females before yes
yeah is there a thing with females where
like if you sort of quit halfway through
a set she knows and you know you kind of
do this cooperative thing rick it's okay
like do you ever feel that vibe or is it
like do you feel like she's judging you
and maybe that pushes you or something i
feel like i'm always the one that was
just like you need to work harder like i
need more from you because i'm not gonna
feel motivated or feel like this is a
good training session if you're just
half passing everything and i'm trying
to go balls to the wall but you don't
have it in yourself to find that so how
are you gonna make me do that sure
that's how i think
[Music]
[Music]
yep
one more
[Music]
go
[Music]
stop karen keep it up
[Music]
yes
[Music]
