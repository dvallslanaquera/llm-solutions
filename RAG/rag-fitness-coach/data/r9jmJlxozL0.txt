they just exited the beginner phase of
everything worked some people go I want
my beginner games back I'm going to do
German volume training psychotic amounts
of volume zero progression just boom
right up to high volume bad idea other
folks will just really take the low road
and say oh man I'm just going to do like
five three one five through one's not a
good intermediate hypertrophy or
strength program because the volume's so
low it barely stimulates you at all sure
it'll keep making you stronger
neurologically for a while but it's not
ideal in the least
