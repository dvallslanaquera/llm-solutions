i feel like i'm done here
hey folks dr mike here renaissance
periodization
tuesday pm session biceps
shoulders forearms one exercise each
about four or five sets of each nice
good stimulus
we do three of these a week as you will
see if you look below
and our whole plan is written out three
of these sessions so we train
essentially biceps
shoulders and forearms three times on
their own nice good high frequency these
muscles tend to recover quickly
today we're super messed up because we
just did legs earlier
eight drove over to the gym took a
couple hours because we were in another
gym across the state
uh guys we're gonna love it
we're gonna kill it we're gonna do all
the things oh shit it's rich piana
anyway let's get to it
[Music]
all right folks starting with spider
curls
it sounds scary i have no idea where the
fuck they're called spider girls but
anyway
you lean on an incline bench the other
way and you curl
emphasis here is on the peak contraction
full range of motion
it's not an exercise reheat a lot of
weight it's really super
premium to go high mind muscle
connection

all right we finished biceps i
personally did five sets i don't know
how many sets these other clowns did
anyway
shut up i wasn't asking anyway
volume's auto regulated so who cares
here's the deal shoulders we're doing a
lateral raise machine it's neat we're in
a new gym trying it out
remember to get the most out of machines
almost always do a full range of motion
control the eccentric
go close to failure and sometimes the
machine fits well sometimes not but
usually you get at least a really good
workout
jared your turn stop getting girls
numbers
come on
oh hey guys i was just posing next to
art it's something people do
anyway wrist curls
i know masturbation joke to get
larger forearms masturbation is
sometimes
you know insufficient so we're going to
be doing five sets
forearm curls jared feather is doing one
arm curls again another easy joke for
you
to type into the comments because he
gets a little bit of elbow pain doing it
this way the way charlie and i are doing
it
and vice versa for us currently
sometimes some exercises fit sometimes
they don't
and yes we are training partners the sr
training is largely the same
but you have to buy 4k training every
now and again when the stimulus the
fatigue ratio is just all for your
training partner
remember there's no dogma no religion
here even though we are iron religion
gym currently
uh you have to do what works and if
something is just really insufficiently
stimulated for you
or it's injurious you got to do maybe an
exercise differently training partner
okay so we're gonna do this let's have
fun let's get pump forms
for you guys watching at home you can
also pump your forearms while watching
all right folks that's the workout
biceps shoulders
forearms if you've wanted to pleasure
yourself and you just couldn't handle
volume and intensity try this workout
and eventually you'll be pleasing
yourself
all night long oh look it's iq pro jared
feather
and ashley lamonkowski
i only know how to say it in russian i
don't know how you may say it uh

of the privilege really anyway
