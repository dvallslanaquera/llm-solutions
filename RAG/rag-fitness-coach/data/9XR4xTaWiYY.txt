hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's topic
is to ask the question should you train
strongmen events to build muscle and
burn fat
notice i didn't say it better for strong
men but a lot of folks have this
question of hey
what do you think of farmers carries for
building traps what do you think of
stone loading to build the back
what do you think of strongmen events to
do cardio and burn fat
great questions let's answer them here
today
in that context so strong men events for
muscle growth we got
three concepts here that we got to talk
about
number one honest truth the strongmen
events are
awful for stimulus to fatigue ratios for
muscle growth building okay yes the
farmer's walk
will grow your traps a ton but at a huge
fatigue cost to your whole body
just ask any strong man if you do
farmer's walk
heavy enough it breaks you down head to
toe
it's a crazy high rating of perceived
exertion it beats up your whole body
it's a ton of fatigue for a very good
stimulus how do you get the same
stimulus or better
with less fatigue first stop walking
okay
in a farmer's carry the walking is
pointless for your traps there's nothing
to do with them you get just as much
trap stimulus standing
okay so now you're standing but it's an
isometric contraction at the very length
and point
good but we can do better what about a
concentric movement
and an eccentric movement and an
isometric what are we doing now
those are just shrugs shrugs standing in
place
are more hypertrophic than farmers
carries and at the same time less
fatigue because you're not moving around
and you're using a little bit less
weight but getting range of motion with
it
you don't say that you're going to get
the biggest quads ever
hopefully by doing yoke walks so why
would you get the biggest traps ever
by doing farmer's carries it doesn't
make a whole lot of sense when you
examine
what the ingredients are for generating
the most hypertrophy
and the least fatigue the least
irrelevant movement possible
and using a load that you can control
for the concentric
isometric hold at the bottom and the top
and an eccentric controlled contraction
you get all of those just doing shrugs
properly
yes farmers walk does grow your traps
but the fatigue cost is
way too high for the pretty decent
stimulus you get you get a great
stimulus
much lower fatigue if you do shrugs i
know it's not sexy i know it's not as
fun
but that is the truth of the matter to
that end
strong men know this almost universally
especially high level experienced ones
they use powerlifting and bodybuilding
movements to put on slides that they
don't use the events to put on size
they get their huge backs with bent rows
and machine rows and deadlifts
and then they take those backs to the
stones to practice stone loading
some excess hypertrophy occurs
definitely from stones it's always
helpful
but if they really wanted more
hypertrophy and less fatigue they would
never do stone loading
it's a technical event to get good at
stones right
big z himself the maybe the strongest
human that's ever lived
definitely competitively as far as
history the greatest strongman of all
time
does incline smith machine barbell
presses to get his pressing
hypertrophy going and then he's pressed
overhead in strong
competition more than anyone ever in the
entire world still to the stay owns log
press world record
hilarious youtube video of big z doing
incline presses and there's an awesome
in-cell comment on the youtube video
which got like 500 responses not very
good ones i'll tell you what he said
and you'll be sympathetic it's some kid
who's like hey man
you might not want to use the incline
smith machine for this
you're better off growing your shoulders
with standing overhead barbell presses
you dumb motherfucker you're talking to
someone whose shoulders are bigger than
your glutes
and who invented the overheads as graced
overhead lifter of all time
thanks for your insight and here's the
thing that kid could have been right but
he wasn't right
because if big z tried to grow his
shoulders and his triceps and his upper
pecs
with standing presses or strong men log
lifts the fatigue would have been so
high
for the limited stimulus it wouldn't
have been worth it so when he needs to
grow muscle
he sits into a smith machine and pumps
out the reps when he needs to get
stronger he does strict presses and
incline presses with a barbell and when
he needs to get
that strength tailored to strong man
then he practices the events
but if you're just focused on your
physique there's no reason for you to do
the strong man events because they're
not the best of you sometime
for building muscle itself joey sat mary
sat strength on youtube give him a
follow
he's one of our training partners and
charlie and i will train with him
we do very similar training with him
when he's in a hypertrophy phase
he trains a lot like a bodybuilder the
difference is
charlie and i his training partners
never do stone loading or yolks or
anything like that and he does
for the technical practice he's under no
illusion that stones are going to get
him jacked
bent rows and pull-ups and pull-downs
are and the stones
get him a little bit more jacked but the
main reason he does them
is for that technical contribution
lastly
we don't want to put a sort of dark
cloud over strong manify perturbing
strongman training is
super fun and if you can fit it into
your maximum recoverable volume for
hypertrophy
absolutely go to town and do it load
some stones carry the oak
do some log presses that'll help you get
more jack just make sure it fits in your
mrv
and when you are pushing hypertrophy is
a real number one priority
towards the end of a fat loss phase and
a really big important gain phase
in a competitive season for bodybuilding
move away from the strongmen movements
perhaps completely or mostly
and do more actual hypertrophy work but
during maintenance phases active rest
phases
just generally when you're having fun
gaining muscle you can pepper in some
strong man movements
just know the trade-offs and don't think
okay i'm gonna do yolk walks
that's gonna grow my erectors more than
anything else it's
very unlikely but if you wanna do them
because they're fun
and they help you grow not optimally
look it's not all about optimal
and strongman is not only just fun but
makes you real world strong in a way
nothing else can
that's totally cool just know the
trade-offs you're getting into
okay you buy a station wagon because it
can take your kids and groceries around
you don't buy it to be the fastest car
ever
and if you're like this station wagon is
the fastest car ever you're just making
a really big mistake
know what you're getting yourself into
if you're cool with that that's totally
fine
now let's talk about strongmen events
for cardio
here's the thing point number one
similar to point number one and
strongman events for size
the events have awful stimulus to
fatigue ratios
for cardio what the hell is a
stimulation fatigue ratio for cardio
what's the stimulus of cardio the
stimulus and cardio is
calories burned per unit time so you
have that in the numerator how many
calories you burn per unit time
and you divide that by the amount of
fatigue the higher the fatigue and the
lower the calories per unit time the
worse
what has the highest sfrs in cardio gee
it's really hard to beat incline walking
or the elliptical
or a stationary organ or rowing it's
very not fatiguing and per
hour you burn a fuck load of calories
you incline walking for an hour that's
like 700 calories
and like someone's like hey are you
really tired and beat up you're like not
really i just took like an hour long
walk i just listened to a podcast
the whole time what about if you load
stones
okay for an hour
how many calories do you burn per hour
stone loading actually a lot
more than walking has anyone ever loaded
stones continuously for an hour the
answer is no
and if you tried you would die so what
would you do if you did cardio for stone
loading you would do stone loading for
an hour
but you take so many breaks and so on
and so forth you might load like 30 or
40 total stones during that time but
that's pretty cool
how much calories are you burning then
maybe two or three hundred whereas if
you just incline walk that entire time
you would burn like four or five hundred
or more or something right
so you burn more calories incline
walking because it's continuous
then you do loading stones and if you
even did so much stone lidding that you
got the same calories burned
loading stones for an hour even if
there's plenty of breaks even if you
burn 700 calories
there's going to be an unbelievable
amount of fatigue your lower back is
fucked everything's fucked your whole
system your biceps as far as
everything's gone you can't just do that
four or five times a week you will break
into pieces
can you incline walk for an hour on a
treadmill four or five times of course
you can bodybuilders of the world overdo
it all the time
so on stimulus to fatigue strong events
for cardio are really just not a good
idea
other modalities are better if you want
to use your back your biceps and your
rear delts
for cardio and some of your hip muscles
and so on and so forth just get on the
ergometer and do distance rowing
one hour of that will burn tons of
calories minimal amount of fatigue if
you do stones instead
or something like that it's just sure
you can burn a lot of calories at an
unbelievable fatigue expense
absolutely not worth it in most cases
now for
recreational fitness folks strongman for
cardio is totally fine because it's
super fun
and a lot of times they need more real
world strength and some muscle growth
and some fat loss and strong men events
give them a really good mix of that
right so it's totally fine to do for
your regular clients to train with you
three or four times a week
do some regular hypertrophy training you
do some strongman type stuff and then in
their own time maybe they're elevating
their physical activity doing a bit of
their own cardio and controlling their
diet that's totally cool
but if you're very serious about fat
loss and muscle retention
right you're let's say interested in
competing in bodybuilding or something
like that
some light strong men work can be okay
but
be careful and know when more boring
high stimulus to fatigue ratio cardio is
better i myself a very analogous example
of this i do
brazilian jiu jitsu i compete in
brazilian jiu jitsu it's super fun
it burns a shitload of calories what
does the fatigue cost fucking kidding me
there's people trying to kill me my
bones are halfway broken every time i'm
down jiu jitsu there's a sensation
everyone knows when they get back
from especially jiu jitsu or the next
day your fingers barely work there's
like this like you have arthritis all
over all of your hands
you're like oh my god what the hell
happened to me that's a whole body
sensation from jiu jitsu that happens
all the time
so does jiu jitsu is a jiu jitsu good
for cardio if you're only looking at the
side of the the equation that says how
many calories you burn 100 percent
what about fatigue terrible so when i'm
getting really serious about a
percentage of training towards the end
of a fat loss diet i'll do less jiu
jitsu because i know it's not a good
idea
that means i do less jujutsu which is
super fun for me and i do more like
inclined treadmill cardio which sucks
do i like it no but that's the reality
of what i have to do
so just know what trade-offs you're
getting yourself into if you want to do
strong man
it's totally cool just understand it's
not the best way to grow muscle
it's not the best way to lose fat but
there are some contexts if you're
willing to make the trade-offs
in which it's totally fine and honestly
it's one of the sports for me
i have very few sports which i watch as
a fan i don't know any football team
names or basketball or no is that a
sport with a tennis racket who knows
i'm a huge fan of strongman i've watched
every single world's strongest man all
the heats
i love strawman it's a beautiful amazing
sport and you can do it
just understand the strongmen themselves
make tons of trade-offs and be willing
to do the same
