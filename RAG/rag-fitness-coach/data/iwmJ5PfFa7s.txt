hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and today's video
is actually just me begging for your
money i don't care what i have to do get
on my knees done that at work before
do this
have done that at work before but
different hand shapes let me just get to
the point
we have
released
the kraken but also
the first cohort for the rp nutrition
certification what
is that
it's a nutrition surd you may have heard
of them before other companies have them
some of them are great some of them are
okay some of them are like things you
can probably do
with your eyes closed get correct and
learn nothing
why should you be doing the rp nutrition
cert course
i'm going to skip
right across that salesy bullshit you
guys have heard for forever fact you
don't need to do the rp cert course
you're absolutely 100 fine without it
however
if you are an individual that wants a
few things
then this is potentially a great product
for you to buy and consume and upgrade
yourself your knowledge and abilities to
just be better at
helping people and making more money
yourself that's the only reason we
design the cert course is to help you
now if you're not in that demographic no
worries at all we're not trying to shove
anything down your throat not a hard
sales video i don't do that shit i have
no idea if someone was like hey you have
to be a vacuum cleaner salesman and go
sell
i just show up people be like why should
i buy this vacuum cleaner
it's a good vacuum cleaner it does
things that takes the dirt and the dirt
goes away and i would lose my job
probably immediately
so i'm just going to tell you guys the
straight up facts and if you want to buy
the cert amazing
if not no big deal continue to consume
the free content maybe someday you want
to buy this sir maybe never you want to
buy cert no skin off anyone's back
here's the thing
the rp nutrition cert is designed
for many people but it's specifically
designed best
for folks that help other people with
their nutrition
if you're just helping yourself with
your nutrition you could to course cost
a thousand dollars
fucking a thousand dollars a lot of
money
do you need to take a thousand dollar
course to help yourself with your own
nutrition no you just download the rp
diet coach app for 15 bucks a month or
just put together your own nutrition
plan from watching like our
fat loss diet made simple series which
will take you two hours to watch the
entire thing and voila you're good to go
but if you're helping other people you
may have run into some sort of
predictable um difficulties
you might have known how to help
yourself really well but you get into
situations with other people where
you're like huh
what the hell is going on you might get
in a situation where like i know what
works
i have real trouble communicating it to
people because they seem to not know any
nutritional science and i have to speak
to them in a way that explains the
concepts and i know in the concepts well
enough to explain it myself but to other
people holy crap
you might be very good at understanding
the concepts but actually setting up a
diet plan for someone writing it from
scratch
and integrating it based with what they
know about their life and building him a
schedule that could be like something
that you're not super well practiced on
and maybe you're well practiced but you
just want to up your game a little bit
and lastly another thing you might want
to interact with well two things
is you may be able to explain things
pretty well
but what clients tell you back is like
less to do with their nutritional
statements like oh i weigh x y z amount
of weight and i have this many macros
but more to do with the psychology of it
they'll come back and be like i'm like
really really fatigued and i'm barely
sleeping and i'm worried a lot about my
weight loss what do i do and you're like
oh god i don't know we'll just do these
macros damn it what's up with all the
psychology so you might want to learn a
bit about human psychology brain and
behavior type of stuff so the very
nature of your dietary intervention you
help them with is already pronged
appropriately
to help them where they are the most
not be like i wish you had a better
attitude i don't know you take them for
where the attitude is and you adjust
your plan to make sure they're the most
successful even going so far is to kind
of open them up to different attitudes
about dieting welcome them into the diet
sphere and improve their relationship
with eating and with planning and with
success and with goals so that they get
the most out of your coaching and lastly
you might want to know a bit more about
how to market yourself
don't learn it for me i didn't write
that section
god i have no idea how that works but
there are folks at rp that are pretty
damn good at this stuff and they'll help
you as someone who helps people with
diets in person or online
just put your best foot forward and
really show off what your value is to
other people
and that can really be helpful because
there's tons of people you guys know
this as well as i do there's tons of
people on like social media they're so
fucking good at diet coaching but they
have like not so many followers and not
so many people know about them there's
still other people that are like
maybe
criminally negligent in diet coaching
but they have like a zillion followers
and they make tons of money if you know
the marketing principles at least at
their basic at least pretty well
then you may have an edge to just make
yourself seen more in that best possible
light and then you get more clients you
help more people they refer and that
whole cycle which we actually describe
in the cert how to
do the best with that whole sort of uh
beneficent cycle unfolds and good things
happen to you and after a while you're
buying your first lamborghini and i'll
uh one of my butlers will be i don't go
to the dealership anymore i can't be
seen there i'm famous one of my butlers
will buy you another lamborghini at the
dealership he'll recognize you as a cert
holder and he'll be like
what's up family and you'll be like what
up you flash the right gang signs
depending on what neighborhood you're in
you don't want to
flash the wrong ones in any case
here's what i'm getting at
the rp
nutrition certification is not
just like a you take a test that takes
two hours and all the results are
obvious like protein is for whatever
calories gram this and that like nah
not that it's not that
it is a course that will take the
average intelligent diligent person
40 to 50 hours to complete
it's an online course it's an
educational experience with modules
examples scenarios questions on those
scenarios
you build programs and those programs
are assessed to see how good you got how
close you got to the likely reality of
what that person needed it's super
intense
40 to 50 hours of total coursework holy
crap
that's like a college course and a half
or something like that that's really
really intense but here's what you get
because of it
first you of course get the rp nutrition
foundations stuff which is like
macros calories timing all the science
all the best practices
we're going to crush that you guys have
gotten a bunch of that for my videos
here at rp on youtube but this will be
like a really formal much more intense
much more like because you know you
could listen to a bunch of podcasts or
me talking to be like yeah i know stuff
but then someone asks you a specific
question you're like
i don't know that thing that thing i
don't know this will make sure you know
that thing those very specific things
it's really really rigorous and really
intense
second thing you'll learn
is the process there's an entire module
on behavior change
like
one does not simply to quote the most
amazing meme ever that's actually my
favorite meme ever is the one does not
simply mean he goes one does not simply
and he's like i got nothing so you can't
always think of things on the fly
one does not simply just impose their
dietary regimen onto another human being
like people on you know instagram when
they post pictures of fat people will be
like how come they don't just lose
weight gee whiz einstein there might be
like behaviors in their life that
they're doing they're maybe not so proud
of maybe they want to change maybe
they're not even aware of that are
interfering with a pretty obvious notion
of eating less and moving more
so the behavior change process module
will sort of teach you insights from
behavioral psychology that allow you to
come at people with your best foot give
them the advice that they need in the
way that best hits them
right so for example i'll take an
example right out
aside from nutrition
right if your significant other walked
out with a dress and was like do you
like this dress there's two ways to say
you don't like it one way is that dress
is ugly okay they'll probably get like a
vase thrown at your head won't work
super well
another way is oh it looks super good i
did love that other dress a ton though
this is the same thing take that dress
off and put the other one on and now
let's go out because we can't be seen in
this first dress you showed
but
one hit's different
one hits the right way to actually get
the behavior changed that everyone knows
is good for everyone so as a behavior
change enlightened person knowing these
principles you learn from the cert
you're going to be able to actually help
human beings now if your idea of helping
human beings is like going on reddit and
talking smack to people or on instagram
comments like lose weight lol sweet
you're well on your way to doing diddly
dick because you're not helping anybody
hopefully you're having fun
but if you actually want to help your
clients and future clients
actually reach their goals the knowing
the behavior stuff is a huge critical
element and i was that nerd that knew
all the nutrition way before i knew the
behavior stuff so i had to learn this
like my equivalent of learning human
behavior is like running
a a race where i just tried not to hop
over any of the barriers that were put
there like running the hurdles but just
right through every hurdle and i was
like ah
my hips hurt i must be hitting something
yeah it's not working as well as i
thought you don't have to go through
that because you can just take the cert
and learn the stuff and be like one step
ahead
the next thing you can learn is the diet
design process
because throwing together a diet for
someone is sweet but you might do a
decent job you might forget a few things
you might do not so good job
the diet design process we have at rp
you can only learn through the cert now
here's the thing the preview is that
you've learned a pretty good chunk of it
already in all the free youtube videos
but this synthesizes living fuck out of
it and gives you an exact template to
follow of what kind of intake questions
to ask people
and based on their decisions what kind
of diet to produce at every level
calories macros et cetera et cetera et
cetera meal timing food selection blah
blah blah
that formalization of the diet design
process can enlighten you so you know
more stuff so you're a better coach but
also it'll give you the tools to just do
a lot of stuff way more efficiently and
faster so you can just like do a great
job
with more clients and thus you get to
make more money plain and simple and
also ps the clients get to be a better
version of themselves their goals are
more achievable and so literally
everybody wins
lastly
as mentioned
the cert is
has an entire module of how to
essentially like manage the business
side of things and do the right kind of
marketing because let's be honest like
you're a personal trainer you're a diet
coach you're whatever who you need to
make money the shit's not free
and you can be an unbelievable coach and
sort of be like one of those like
starving artists where no one realizes
how great you are because you're really
bad at the business and marketing side
or you can be like scumbag business
marketing person who knows nothing about
nutrition but can like sell sand at the
desert so you make like a zillion
dollars or crash corvettes and
everywhere you go but like you actually
have no idea how to help anyone
you don't want to be on either side of
that you want to be right somewhere in
the middle but elevated to where you are
both really good at marketing and really
good at doing your job and you help as
many people as possible because more
people know about how good you are and
can reach out to you and of course
eventually when you reach your capital
how many clients you can help
and more people keep reaching out you
might need to hire other people to work
for you or you need to increase your
rates at some point
lamborghinis champagne you may even
invest in a champagne power lamborghini
something yeah scott video guy write
that down
champagne-powered lamborghini why for
frivolousness alone
right that doesn't have to work work
that runs on burnt money
yeah i do have a lamborghini that only
runs on burnt old hundred dollar bills
um i can't i can't separate myself from
that car it's nostalgia right when you
guys made your first trillion like me
you'll understand what that feels like
so in any case
the thing about the rp diet
certification is it's not just stamp on
your forehead that says rp says you know
things it's also that
if i meet you and you're rp certified
i'm like yo respect like you probably
coach better than me
but what it does is arm you with like
legit tools
that just straight up make you a better
coach
this is not a money grab we worked at it
too long and too hard and it's already
50 trillion search to the marketplace
and a bunch of them are really good
but this is
you learn to do stuff our way because we
think our way is legit super effective
and it'll help your clients like crazy
and help you like crazy and if it's
worth
the thousand dollars to you
fucking take the course if it's not
worth a thousand dollars to you no big
deal
no big deal at all now here's the
thing we're making this video it's like
mid-august and that's kind of when it'll
post in the next few days after we make
it for the next week and a half two
weeks or so
there is an early bird discount
that it costs
700 bucks instead of a thousand bucks
same course
and on
september 19th
the first cohort closes and the next
cohort starts the next year because it's
like a serious course like there's a
cohort you have like i think 500 people
you take the course with there's like
interactions and social media with
people who are giving the course like
it's it's a process it's not just like
what take it whatever you want
not like that
so
if you can slot in in the next week and
a half you'll save 300 bucks so if
you're thinking like oh i should do this
but you're putting it off stop putting
it off just do it now
if you put it off a little no big deal
price goes up closer to a thousand or
two thousand bucks for another month
september 19th caught off now can you
sign up for the course after of course
you'll just have to start in like
january february when the next cohort
starts
right that's the deal
gee i said a lot
folks just buy this thing so i can just
i just bought more money i just want
more money
i want a champagne lambo
