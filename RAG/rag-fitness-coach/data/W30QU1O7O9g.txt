you are in the gym for high quality high
quality is the most likely to grow
muscle not going through the motions so
if you have a really good technique on
your sets if your neural Drive is really
high and your mind muscle connection is
super high the only thing you have to
worry on the other end is nutrition and
Recovery because you're driving
it in you're going to get growth if your
nutrition recovery are good and you're
not at your genetic cealing or something
however nutrition recovery genetics blah
blah blah if your Technique sucks if
your neural drive sucks if your mind
muscle connection is off you're going to
be getting a small fraction of which you
could be so focus on quality first and
then worry about quantity
