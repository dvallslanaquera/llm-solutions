up one more let's go yes go
up you can quit some other time you put
somebody else's channel down
[Applause]
go
folks dr mike i'm here with powerlifting
extraordinaire michelle lynn
she hit us up and she was like i don't
think dr mike is tough
or knows what he's doing or can train
hard or knows what he's doing she said
that twice
and i was like oh is that right well why
don't you show up and do a hypertrophy
hammond glute workout with us and she
was like nah and i was like come on and
she was like all right
so here we go how are you feeling pretty
good
ready for hypertrophy i only do uh
strength movements all right oh this
will be extra fun
folks let's tune it in we have
sumo stiff legged deadlifts then we have
machine hip thrusts
and then sumo deep paws squats
for the glutes and the hams let's get it
done good to go
yeah those are none of the things i ever
do so this will be real extra fun then
we are doing first exercise is
slight sumo stiff legged deadlifts hits
the hamstrings are well hits the
adductors as well
and of course hits the glutes really
good exercise to mix in both hamstring
and glute activation
it's probably limited by hamstrings but
don't worry we'll do more glute stuff
later
this thing fries the hamstrings so much
we're probably going to need like three
sets of like six reps
she's a power lifter she's used to low
reps she gets great my muscle connection
here
three sets of six is probably all we'll
need we'll even see if she gets six on
the later ones
and technique is critical here
must make sure that your hips
pre-stretch the hamstrings
you cannot get into this sort of
kyphotic position it's got to be neutral
or even organic
to really anteriorly tilt the hips
the knees have to be in a solid position
they can't start going forward
they have to be almost unlocked and our
position is going to be slight sumo
chest stays up all the focus on the hams
it's tough but it works
slow you're in control
and up up up up up up up up up yeah
there's one more we didn't laugh
last one pick it up good technique and
then slow
arch that back that's it good
good stuff good stuff
yeah that was that was painful wow
[Music]
so the first one doesn't feel that bad
the first rep yeah it gets harder feel
your hamstrings
yeah cause i usually do the thing where
you try to finish the rep
faster so there's a lot more time
underneath oh yes tons of time under
tension
yeah the hamstrings thrive on that the
goal with power lifting
is to try to become as efficient as
possible use the most musculature
and get the lift done quickly so you can
get out of the way with
hypertrophy training we actually just
want to expose individual muscles as
much as possible
which reverses everything first of all
it's more isolation and second of all
it's slow and you're like fuck i wish i
wasn't here but
your muscles will be beneficial
[Music]
control good
three three more big chest low
oh good keep that back tight no rounding
back tight
tight tight tight up that was a bullshit
rep
one more slow and
up and then control it on the way down
as if you're gonna do another slow
slow slow slow slow slow that's it good
these are like slipping out
good stuff good stuff oh my god
that's it
[Music]
all right so we are going to be doing
hip thrusts these are machine hip
thrusts
hip threats are interesting in my
experience if you tend to load up a shit
load of weight
and just kind of do them dynamically you
get some glute activation but not a
whole lot happens as far as stimulus
perspective or as much as we'd like
i prefer to do these marathon set or
giant set style where you have a certain
total number of reps you want to hit
total
and you just add up the mini sets to get
there resting like oh
10 to 20 to 30 seconds between each mini
set that way you can really get lactic
acid buildup
metabolites are a great way to go about
this exercise specifically
and we're gonna go for two second count
at the very top because that's when the
glutes engage the most on this exercise
there unfortunately is no stretch
component here
so we're going to do a ton of reps over
the course of multiple sets
we're probably going to do a sum total
of 40 repetitions here
it's going to take oh three to six sets
to get done maybe a little more
and it's going to be really awesome i
wouldn't train these heavy if you get a
lot out of it that's great that's not my
recommendation
go for light go for shorter rest breaks
go for a really awesome top hold
if you have a huge burn in your ass
if i was your doctor i wouldn't tell you
this is a good thing but in this case
it's a great thing
let's burn that ass 11 all the way
through go go go go
hold down and one last one
up hold and down good
13. oh my hit it again
we're at 13. we got to get to 40 total
right now
right now oh yeah forget the power
lifting days you're a bodybuilder now
14 15
16 you better hold it up there 17.
let's get to 20. hold 18.
hold 19. come all the way up hold
20. that's it
[Music]
hold it three deep up
four good one more up hold
five okay good relax that's 25
we got 15 left take a nice long break
you might have different definitions of
long breaks we have a very different
definition of long break
hold it and down that's one hold
down that's two hold hold
hold down that's three up hold
that's four up hold
five one more you gotta push those hips
through push through
through through through and down good
job very good do you feel that in your
glutes
we're going right off the gun hit it up
and hold
down that's one hold hold
hold down that's two ready
hold hold hold hold up
down now go up again and hold right now
go up
hold keep holding keep holding keep
holding keep holding
keep holding don't go anywhere keep
holding keep holding hips through hips
through
hips through look how easy it is now
hips through and it's through again keep
going
and hips through down
that's it
wow good stuff
take your time take your time there's no
rush yes okay so we did stifle like a
deadlift sumo style for hitting the
mostly hams a little bit of glutes of
course the lower back it's involved
then we did hip thrust which really
toasts the glutes not a ton of hams
now we finish off the glutes and
actually hit a little bit of quads and
adductors
for the sumo squats which are going to
be slow descent
full passes at the bottom ultra deep
because the deeper the better for the
glutes
a few sets here between you know eight
and 12
repetitions high quality the weight's
not going to be super impressive because
you're super tired at this point
as long as you're feeling it in your
legs especially your glutes we're good
to go
slow don't you dare go down fast
good couple more i'm right here with you
let's go
slow up another one
[Music]
up two deep
slow come on now
up up rest breathe don't rack
control one more
let's go
one more last one you got this go
yes
ah another one i feel like i'm hearing
colors
you're hearing color did we get that on
the mic oh my gosh
you know lifting's supposed to be a
psychedelic experience
that was really awesome take your time
and rest oh my god down set
uh we're dropping off went from 115 to
95.
gonna do a few more reps here at the end
really focus on mind muscle connection
high
quality repetitions she's rolling around
on the ground right now
trying not to die nothing feels
comfortable nothing feels comfortable
i like can't get comfortable welcome to
lifting
uh all right let's get it finished it
looks like she's recovered enough
to uh put the sword in the stone or
whatever let's do it
go rest up again
that's six up seven
slow up
breathe rest don't go anywhere don't go
