hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
and today's bs series topic is that
carbs
cause fat gain
say it ain't so say it ain't so so
really quickly
the propensity for a nutrient
taken in to cause the creation of new
body fat
is called its adipogenesis or adipogenic
ability
and all the three macronutrients fats
carbs and proteins can actually be
ranked on average by the degree to which
they are adipogenic
the degree to which they lead to the
likelihood of fat storage
all other things being equal
and fats are by far the most adipogenic
and this is for the straightforward
reason that they require almost no
biochemical modification
so they arrive they're very
uh scantily modified they can be highly
modified or they cannot and then they
get stored into fat cells and voila
right in they go
carbs are next their conversion to fat
requires a few chemical steps but not so
many and it's quite an easy process and
so they're not quite as likely to make
you fat as our fats but uh pretty close
and then a little further down that list
are proteins
proteins are
sure adipogenic if you eat enough of
them but in some cases in some
situations
the conversion of amino acids to the uh
sort of intermediary products that are
eventually used to construct fats and
thus store away that energy as fats is a
little bit maybe considerably more
difficult considered more laborious
consider more complicated and there are
all a bunch of steps in that pathway
that may not get done to a certain
degree of efficiency so the proteins end
up being not as adipogenic my job very
very clear about this
proteins carbs and fats
are
very similar to each other and their
adipogenicity
under some conditions some special
circumstances they can be very different
but usually they're very similar so it
is not true that you can like eat five
steaks a day of protein on top of a
normal diet and be like it's protein bro
there's no way to gain fat from it
that's fucking wrong
but in some situations and generally on
average protein is a little bit less
likely to cause fat gain when eaten
calories for calorie carbs a little bit
more likely and fats the most likely so
already we have a problem because most
of the people that say carbs are really
bad for weight uh gain and they make you
gain tons of fat and carbs cause fat
gain there are almost always people that
are super supportive of relatively high
fat diets
and
that's kind of saying that
you know
oh where are we gonna go with this
analogy
your truck makes a lot of noise but my
motorcycle that makes 10 decibels more
noise is not a problem
come on
and also people with loud motorcycles
what is it that you're trying to tell
the rest of us
that you're tough that you're not to be
fucked with or do you maybe just need a
hug
folks if you have a motorcycle and you
like to have the motorcycle that makes
lots of noise the harley davidson
cruiser types
uh if you see me anywhere come come give
me a hug bro we'll hug it out
in any case
number two
what actually causes fat gain and net
weight gain
is eating more calories than you expend
regardless of whether or not those
calories come from proteins carbs or
fats or in almost every case a
combination of those so for almost
everyone it just doesn't matter where
the extras come from so for example
you've eat your normal diet of 2 300
calories that keeps you at whatever body
weight you're at 171 pounds
and then you decide to throw in into
that day an extra hundred grams of carbs
in the form of pixie sticks that you of
course snort
not sure pixie stix it's got the video
guys there another way to take in pixie
stix that does not involve snorting them
not that i know of and uh or you say you
know what i'm just going to have an
extra chicken breast mostly protein or
you have an extra globo butter
my favorite source of fat
you will gain almost the identical
amount of weight above your maintenance
value if the calories are equated the
weight gain is going to be almost
identical and as a matter of fact by
small margin we can expect over time
that the global butter actually gains
you the most weight pixie stick dust
not snorted but actually consumed gains
the second and potentially the chicken
breast gains least by the teeniest
tiniest little margin right
you could say at this point but hold on
what about the carbohydrate insulin
model of obesity doesn't insulin go up
when you eat carbs doesn't insulin make
you gain fat
those are both true
but
when insulin goes up
and there are carbohydrates around it
shuttles the carbohydrates into the
cells and can make you fatter
than if you didn't eat those
carbohydrates
if you have lots of fat floating around
then the insulin opens up the fat cells
and it actually helps transport all the
nutrients in so once the carbohydrates
are gone instead of using them for
energy they're trapped somewhere else
you've got fats floating around and then
the fats are more likely than being
stored as the extra
either way you slice it
whether it's insulin pulling into carbs
or the fats floating in by themselves to
a variety of other mechanisms
insulin or not
the extra nutrients in your bloodstream
in healthy non-diabetic people will end
up getting into your fat cells anyway
if they're not getting into your fat
cells you are really really deep shit
huge health problems you're like keto
acidotic or something like that you need
to go to the hospital right
the carbohydrate insulin model of
obesity
is wrong
it's been demonstrated wrong
in
a almost universal body of incredibly
well done studies
that have been done for
40 or 50 years now
such that
the carbohydrate insulin model of
obesity versus the caloric model of
obesity
being wrong is common agreed upon
knowledge in academic circles in
nutrition
the
people that will make you believe that
is not the case are keto zealots that
are very famous for selling keto books
and having keto podcasts and shit like
that
jason fung or something like that that's
one of those guys
um
ludwig
forget what his first name is uh another
one of those guys there's like four or
five guys there are super low carb
anti-carb people and they make lots of
noise and they are in wild disrepute in
the academic community in the circle in
which uh we're concerned with with
adipogenic nutritional interventions
now
that is not to say that low carb dieting
is bad it is absolutely a great way to
eat and stay healthy if that's what
you're into no problem
but we can't say high carb eating is bad
and adipogenic because within the
context of a controlled calorie diet it
is not
so if
you are ducking every carb that comes
your way
like bullets in the matrix
sorry for the focusing problem scott the
video guy but here we go
wait wait wait wait wait
you guys remember that shit when he got
sort of shot a little bit in the leg and
then he fell and i was like he's dead
for sure and then trinity saved
yeah good times if you're doing that
shit but you are pac-manning that's like
the world is coming to a fucking end
more like you're gonna try out for sumo
wrestling soon
then you kind sir
are guilty of a mild case of what the
french called el bulshit
and they say it so well
so in any case
be active be healthy
control your total food intake
eat a diet of any combinations really as
long as you hate the minimums of
proteins carbs or fats that you like
neither proteins nor carbs nor fats
are particularly more adipogenic than
the other
particularly more bad for your health
than the other
focusing on that is going to lead you
down tons of blind alleys
folks thank you for tuning in
again if you are a cruiser motorcyclist
i'll see you in the real world
and we're going to hug and we could even
kiss
depending on how i'm feeling that day
and how you're looking
see you next time
you
