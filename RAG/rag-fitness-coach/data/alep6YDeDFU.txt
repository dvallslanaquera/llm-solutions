go go go
up yes up up all the way down man
folks
I used to be Dr Mike
then I decided
F that I would swear but I can't
I'm chilling now I took 18 xanies your
boy's comfy in this hoodie I bought them
from Jared Jared thinks you're a great
zany dealer to your white trash roots
this is Conan yes he is a barbarian but
he is also a few things he is of many
different nations and peoples and speaks
no fewer than 9 000 languages how many
is it actually five things five yeah
whatever five nine thousand it's a lot
in any case he is also a comedian and he
happens to be an ifbb physique
the original he competes against Jared
feather they're going to start hitting
each other in the face very shortly but
before that Conan's got to do a cosmetic
thing called get big arms we're gonna
train his arms they're already huge he's
contest dieting he's low on energy he
says let's see if we can get some laughs
going at his expense right now
are handy dandy RP training app beta
says that we have dumbbell Skull
Crushers first I programmed them in
myself we're going to be doing three
sets here very likely 15 to 20 reps nice
and light starting out Conan is contest
prep we got to start out nice and light
to get some heat going through the
joints and then we'll go on to heavier
stuff later not ideal for most of you
folks training but in contest prep weird
stuff has to happen we're going to be
giving you a ton hopefully of really
good cues for this exercise dumbbell
Skull Crushers let's get it done
and up and one more slow keep them in
and up very good rack
this is already heavy
I would take you pretty close to failure
so don't worry about the rep count too
much just really focus on quality reps
get deep as possible because as it gets
harder you're kind of stopping really
high keep your head back feeling like
this it's the it doesn't go stretching
yeah
you said you do mostly cables I assume
that means you do a lot of press downs
and shit so if I'm not used to this
horizontal type of tricep exercise it'll
just hits an entirely different head of
the tricep I do just like almost half
the size table and yeah okay
up
11 elbows in yes
it's gonna be hard
12 down slow control
up
a couple more 13. let's get to 15 slow
vitamin Conan
up
elbows in on the way down last one good
one
let's go come on man slow right up
go go go rack
[Music]
good stop
good stuff very good it's just like a
it's I'm not used to it sure sure yeah
but it's a good thing you know sure sure
that's why this is my merch be
uncomfortable
well here you go I'm getting uncle
okay elbows in close together the whole
time yes just like that now hit it but
not straight like so elbows together not
turn not at all right here is good
it's easy for the dumbbell skull crusher
to start flaring out a ton cutting a
range of motion
it's imperative that you try to bring
your elbows close together especially on
the way down if you come out you're
still using triceps a lot but it's also
more pecs you want to make it more try
specific by keeping it close and lock
and you really want to get into this
rhythmic pattern where your elbows are
outside of the equation they're locked
right in place and then only movement
occurs about the joint that it's
supposed to be slow controlled on the
way down good pause here for Conan and a
nice powerful extension no wiggling no
weaving just the right stuff
tan two more you got this slow
[Music]
up
again slow control elbows in
up go go go
rack good shit
oh no serious burning oh yeah good good
very good
feeling different than when you do like
a push down right yeah a little
different way difference
so I would say it's probably smart to
include some sort of vertical tricep
exercise like whether that's a push-out
or an overhead variation and then also
some form of a skull crusher so if you
start implementing that you'll probably
see that your triceps get a lot thicker
[Music]
or something like this really good yeah
[Music]
next exercise if you guys didn't hear we
just had a little conversation about how
he can potentially split up his volume
in the future so we're gonna do two
horizontal exercises for the triceps the
next one was going to be an inverted
skull instead I'm going to show him kind
of how he can make that modification to
a horizontal plus a vertical tricep
exercise hitting different heads of the
tricep or at least emphasizing them with
different exercises so the next exercise
will since this was horizontal it's
going to be a more vertical emphasis
we're going to do push Downs with mile
reps so I don't think he's done any sort
of breast Falls mile reps recently but
he is one used to cables oftentimes for
his tricep which you just told us and I
don't want this entire workout because
he is three weeks out from a show I
don't want the whole thing to be some
sort of Novel stimulus and just fuck
them up and really interfere with his
training again three weeks out he's been
doing a lot of cable shit so instead of
just making everything different we're
gonna go ahead do some Myra press Downs
with the press down that he's normally
been doing throughout his last training
block and then just that the secondary
what we're showing you is all
alternating from a horizontal to a
vertical tricep
seven slow on the way up slow
hold that stretch for a second then down
yeah there you go keep it close to your
body
[Music]
there it is nine elbows back
we're gonna fight those elbows back I
know it hurts like hell yeah
big push hello eleven slow one more hold
that two stretch big push
slow as if you're gonna do another
rack very good that was a ride I could
have done more
because the left is the injured one I
started like shaking and printing all
right
the right I could have done at least
like three or four more we'll do mine
already so we'll do a push-up after the
end very cool what is the most
it's like a rest boss
so the first set you'll get what you get
and the rest of the set you're trying to
match that but you're obviously going to
be really fatigued so you probably fail
before whatever it is let's say it's 15.
so let's say you get 12 you'll pause for
like five seconds do two more pause do
another one just like Russ boss
basically
there you go for the body come on hold
the body push push push
oh is that the second rest a second we
got four more
foreign
[Music]
want you to back up over here put your
feet over there and you're gonna do
push-ups but here's the deal
put your hands right here just outside
of your chest come all the way down
until your chest touches the ground go
all the way up until you're completely
locked out that's a push-up
representation okay your hips stay nice
and high
all arms when you're done and you can't
do this anymore come down to your knees
and do push-ups off of your knees sound
good we'll let you know when to do both
two goes to the body
I know it's fucking hard but don't
sacrifice technique
that was great
actually close to the body come on slow
not again you got it go you got it go as
if you're another gonna do another slow
nice and slow slow resist resist resist
don't rack pause wait rack
all right three keep that butt up it'll
be hard
four slow
up five again Conan let's go
up
we'll go to six one more God damn it
slow walk out Conan hips up speed yes
one more slow
up yep come on up up go slow
rest a bit rest
six sorry six three good God and up
again four one last one slow slow wait
stop
I don't I don't remember when I did last
time push-ups feeling good five
sometimes
yeah all right
halfway done anyway
this is
insane Fila solid pump oh yeah very good
I can't badly move my arm again
[Music]
feet close together
come all the way down for the stretch
hold
slow
hold
slow just like that triceps are over
Corona's triceps are super pumped Now we
move to biceps two exercises here the
first one being incline dumbbell curls
what you want to do is make sure that
your chest is pointed up you set the
incline just enough to give you a real
deep stretch on the biceps at the bottom
come up nice and quick and athletically
I would recommend pausing at the top
just to make sure you can have a stable
starting place for that slow eccentric
you'll notice we want to come up quick
but control the way down that gives us
all the benefits of muscle growth and
the resultant happiness and connectivity
with the rest of your community big
biceps you can around hug Grandma hug
the dog hug a rat in the sewer hug
yourself
control two slow
ly yep yep
Slow Down slow
[Music]
good shit holy fuck now we're talking
burning now we're talking don't tell me
it's burning I'm not your gynecologist
boom slow
last one come on
squeeze up slow slow the slowest the

[Music]
all right folks end of the arm workout
we're in the awesome lighting room here
at Fit club turn the lights on we're
gonna see how ridiculous Conan can look
we have Easy Bar bicep curls we're gonna
do three sets and yes they will be my
rep match which means whatever he gets
on the first set he's gonna have to make
the same reps on the second and third
getting as many mini sets as he can to
get the job done Kane is coming
he doesn't have any body fat left either
so no hope for him let's get it done 12.
slow
couple one you got this you got this
don't put it down no man let's go go go

[Laughter]
today's workout will be six total sets
of biceps yeah it feels like
good good
yeah the pump is crazy
how's the uh so like similar to your
session you do how many sets use like
30.
yeah our triceps sent biceps together
yeah which is pretty comparing I do just
a lot of different angles you know it's
just like a pretty comparable pump to
what you normally get
no I would say a little bit better a
little better wow one way to control it
great stretch two slow slow

good stuff dude
dude all I did was yell
[Music]
so thoughts that's good
excellent yeah okay excellent my arms
your uh these are all new techniques to
you
but within a set you really caught on
you never rushed The Eccentric you
finish the Reps amazing work very
impressive uh it's like you're a
professional at this point you're a
professional bodybuilder I should maybe
do something
entering one it's really fun Jared what
do you think impressive for a
bodybuilder honestly impressive for a
bodybuilder because a lot these
motherfuckers do this kind of shit that
was really good man folks there are
barbarians and there are civilized men
Conan is a mix of both and an excellent
person and this was a phenomenal workout
if you want big arms Jesus do whatever
fuck he's doing holy shit well that'll
sign us off see you guys next time
thank you
[Music]
