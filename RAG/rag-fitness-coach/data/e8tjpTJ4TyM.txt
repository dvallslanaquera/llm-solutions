hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization today's topic
is going to be how to help to be the
best personal trainer you can be
so we have 10 tips that i think are
fairly important
for personal trainers so that they can
do their best if you're a personal
trainer
then you might get a decent amount of
value out of this video i was a personal
trainer for a very long time
so was nick shaw the co-founder of
renaissance prioritization
and so we're tons of our coaches and and
tons of the folks
that we associate with i used to be a
professor actually i guess
now a professor again but one of the
courses i used to teach for a long time
was a personal training course like how
to be a good personal trainer so
uh some insight here if you're not a
personal trainer this might be a
valuable video anyway
because you might want to be a personal
trainer later and
even if you never have any of those
plans if you ever hire a personal
trainer you can sort of go through a
checklist to be like are they doing any
of these things
and if they are that's really awesome
and if they're not hey maybe you want to
look around
for somebody else or drop some not so
subtle hints so
here's the deal this is all about being
as good as you can be as a personal
trainer
so the underlying stuff we're not going
to talk about is like
no sport science and exercise science so
you can actually administer a good job
like know how to program okay
number one goes without saying this is a
bit more of the sell nuances
of how to deliver your services so here
we go tip number one
is to be warm and welcoming okay tons of
people that show up to have personal
trainers
they're really kind of freaked out and
they don't know where to start right
and almost everyone is a little bit
apprehensive and anxious when they come
to the gym for the first time or they
hire trainer for the first time
because gym is a scary place like you're
one of these wild animals that's jacked
and lean and
you're you're the sort of you know the
lion in the jungle but everyone that
shows up is like holy crap
i don't really belong here that's very
intimidating if you as a personal
trainer are intimidating as well
yeah there could be like some bonus
points for you to recruit some clients
because they think oh wow this person
really knows stuff
but when at least when they're your
clients and probably just all around the
gym anyway because that's how you
attract clients is if you're warm and
welcoming
and super super nice to people and just
sort of welcome them into fitness
then they're gonna be much more likely
to be recruited by you
and or to stick around because they're
just like wow this is so great like this
person makes something that's really
scary to me which is why by the way they
paid for a personal trainer
make it easy they make it fun and i
don't feel intimidated nearly as much
really really really good idea right
number two
you got to listen to what the client
wants it's their goals it's their body
if someone tells me
hey listen i just want to jack up her
body i don't care about my legs i might
ask them a few questions to make sure
they have their sort of ducks in a row
thinking wise on that
but i'm not going to be like fuck that
brah you know what i'm saying squat
until you drop
never skip leg day hashtag whatever like
that's nonsense
it's totally fine if someone wants
jacked up her body uh and legs that are
made for endurance maybe they do that or
maybe they just don't care about their
legs
or you know for females let's say you're
a female personal trainer and you're
watching this video and you have a
female client that's like
i don't want you know any upper body
size
i mean you can explore that issue
gingerly and gently but at the end of
the day some people just don't want it
and it's not your job number one to
impose your value system on theirs and
say well
you know you have to be a sort of
promulgation of modern feminine
aesthetics and you have to have muscle
in your body because women are doing
nowadays
there's a lot of value to that but it's
not value you can impose on somebody
else you can of course explore those
topics especially later when you get to
know them better
but at first glance you really just kind
of have to do generally what they say
now
it is on you to hem in what's realistic
and what's not okay clients can say like
i want 50 inch packs you could be like
uh
right like i can't actually deliver that
to you it's like getting an iphone
and then calling apple and be like this
doesn't fly me to the moon like uh
can i get a phone that flies me to the
moon they're gonna have to be like well
you see this phones aren't that powerful
yet
so you have to him in what's realistic
and be very informative so you don't
make promises you can't keep
if a client says i want to lose 50
pounds in three months you're gonna have
to give them the
the real talking of their lives gingerly
gently welcomingly of course
but you gotta be like look you know like
he we might be able to do 15 and then
see how we can go from there
still going to be really tough number
three
you have to develop a basic road map of
how to get them to their goals
okay if you don't have a plan as a
trainer
holy shit is the client in trouble
can you imagine like you know you join
the space marines
and you're like you're serving under
like sarge and he's got a cigar and like
a bunch of
dead alien tattoos he's killed tons of
aliens and you're like
you know you're like dropping into
planet beta9 and everyone's cocking
their space guns
and like and you're like sarge what's
the plan he's like there's no plan
hit the ground and shit happens you're
like fuck i'm gonna die
you know that's insane the person
leading the person ostensibly who knows
things
should probably have some kind of plan
so if a client turns to a personal
trainer it's like hey
so what are we doing today personal
trainer is like you know we're going to
play it by feel like holy craps you got
to have some sort of plan
medium term plan long term plan for how
we're going to get where we're gonna get
you know we're gonna lose three pounds
every four weeks and get you to fat loss
goal we're gonna train this much so on
and so forth right
and you should probably give your
clients the high level
of what the plan is just so they know
that they have the sort of warm
comfort of a plan existing around them
not that they want the details
do not do the following don't be like
well technically speaking we're going to
accumulate with the following
progressive micro segment don't do this
shit they have no idea what you're
talking about also they don't care like
i used to have a tax guy who did my
taxes that was like so what we're going
to do is well the fuck please just take
this money
do my taxes don't lie to anybody i don't
want to know i don't want to know taxes
that's why i'm paying you right they
don't want to know the nitty-gritty now
if they do they'll just ask you
but you just want to give them the
general flow like hey like you know
we're going to be doing some
progressively harder training over the
next several weeks
and here's what we're going to do with
our diet what do you think and they love
that sort of thing it gives them a feel
of ownership a little bit and that's
security that you have a plan for them
on the ownership side and the getting
things done side notice i mentioned
nutrition
right nutrition is very often overlooked
but is a huge huge component
if you just train people and they come
to you because remember people don't
come to you for you to train them
common myth lol i'll get to what i mean
in just right now
they don't come for training they come
to look differently because 99 out of
100 clients
are there to look sexier plain and
simple whatever they think that is
maybe not just sexier but just better
just like how they want to look adonis
and shit right they don't come there for
training specifically
if you were like come here i've got this
like magic wand that i can wave you
don't have to train at all you just get
the body of your dreams they're not
gonna be like oh no no i'm here to use
the precor hack spot
they gotta say that they're gonna be
like well wave that fucking wand to me
god damn it
does this really is this a matter of
money i just pay you extra money so at
the end of the day they're paying to
look better
the thing is most clients almost all
have no idea of the relative importance
of training versus diet to results and
we all know
diet's hugely important you can train
into the ground and won't accomplish a
damn near
thing aesthetically visually because
there's too much fat
or there's not enough calories coming in
there's not enough muscle so on and so
forth so
you should probably have at least an
exploration of a discussion of diet
pretty soon into your training progress
maybe not right away like someone
signs up for your training or what are
you doing with diet maybe a couple
sessions then you'll be like so
how are you feeling how you're training
that pretty good you're like how's your
diet is the you know you feel like
you're eating pretty well to support
this
nine times out of ten again they'll be
like dude i have no idea what the fuck
i'm doing with my diet
please help and then you extend your
dietary services which is really really
awesome
number four ease into the training
there's a pressure for all of us
to try to scale fuck out of clients and
try to show them that we know what
they're doing by making them super sore
it's not an accomplishment
you just push someone close to failure
repeatedly with high volume they'll get
sore they'll get fucked up
they'll get really tired um what you
want to do is build a long term you want
to communicate these to your clients as
well
because any time a client says like i
don't feel like we're training hard
enough you're like oh shit you didn't
opened up
the can of worms now because the next
workout they die right that's always
easy to do but you don't have to quite
do it
what you want to do is ease in and of
course make the workouts challenging but
progressively more challenging over time
ease into the training specifically to
focus on technique if you can build a
really good technical mastery habit
pride in your clients if they have an
ownership of their technique
they start doing bench presses correctly
squats correctly pull ups correctly
first of all your job is easy as fuck
because you just tell them great job and
you sort of push them a little bit
you don't have to correct 50 things at
the same time because you did that at
the front end if you never teach them
technique you just try to train them
hard
you'll have this like weird juggling act
where six months into the training
their technique sucks but backing off
now means you're training them too easy
start with technique first because
remember a lot of people that are new to
personal training especially
sort of proper personal training they're
going to get great results anyway even
training
not as hard as they possibly could now
of course point number five
is once you get them the technique
decent level
they sort of earn more load as they
demonstrate good technique
eventually the load gets pretty high the
reps in reserve start to fall
and the volume starts to go up it's fun
but it's more and more intense
and another thing just real quick it's
not on this list tell them you're doing
that
okay so they'll leave a workout on
monday and they'll be like oh that was
great
look all right see you next monday it's
going to be a little tougher and they're
going to be like
okay right whereas if next monday they
come up and it's tougher they're like
what the hell did i do something wrong
are you punishing me people legit don't
know this kind of stuff
and you'll say to them the workouts on
average over time we're getting some
easy days and some breaks
are getting harder and harder and harder
and they're like oh my god how does that
work like well that's because you're
going to get in better and better and
better shape
you don't think like people walking
around in amazing shape just do easy
workouts and almost everyone will be
like nah yeah you're right i have this
coming
but it's something good for them to know
number six it's an interactive process
so
watch to see if they prefer something
more than something else
and watch for and ask for preferences
and irritations so for example
if someone every time you have them do
hack squats they're like i hate this
exercise
and when you have them do high bar
squats or leg processors they're like i
love this this is great
do you have to do hack squats as much as
high bar squats and leg presses no they
accomplish roughly the same thing you
can trade in hack spots on occasion just
for variation or maybe even just lunges
or something
and do the other exercises more
what if a client on pull downs gets like
a click in their shoulder and it hurts
more and more
uh versus on assisted pull-ups with
certain grips they feel completely
awesome they just get a huge lap pump
but are you really just gonna keep
pushing pull downs on them maybe later
you'll re-explore pull-downs with
different grips and different cadence
and so on and so forth but for the
short term give them more of what seems
to fit them best
right and that includes exercises that
includes rep ranges as well
you have a client who sets a five in the
squat and they're like my knees hurt i
don't feel shit my quads
you have them do a set of 12 and they're
like my quads aren't fire my knees feel
great
you know that's a lesson for you to
learn it's not a top-down only thing
it's an interactive process where you
watch and ask now have some skepticism
because sometimes people just say
everything sucks
because everything sucks sometimes but
at least try to get into the nuance of
like asking about joint stuff versus
muscle stuff so on and so forth
point number seven a lot of clients are
there for general fitness and just to
look as sexy as possible
in the shortest amount of time and a lot
of clients can't give you a ton of time
they'll give you two or three sessions a
week
they also muscle size-wise relative to
their
lungs and heart and vasculature is not
so impressive
so while you are jacked and shit you
might need three minutes break between
sets to make them productive
they might not they might need one
minute and
to maximize the stimulus to time ratio
the amount of oomph you're giving them
for how little time they spend at the
gym you might really want to consider
antagonist compound supersets
that's something like doing pull-ups
resting for like just a little bit
and then doing some push-ups and then
resting for 30 seconds to a minute and
then repeating that cycle
right like a set of something the
agonist muscle set of something or
muscles completely unevolved like you
can do
uh push press superset to squat or
something like that you do multiple sets
of those it covers huge swaths of their
body
gives them more than enough stimulus to
accomplish what they want
burns a shitload of fat too and calories
it feels super hard they get out of
breath which
usually most people like makes them feel
like they're getting value out of the
training
and it maximizes the amount of effort
they can put in the gym in the short
time possible so give that a thought
i go so far to say that for most
personal training clients unless they
have
very specific goals that aren't met by
this compound attacking and supersets
are really sort of the bread and butter
of training that's how almost everything
works if i was a personal trainer again
almost everyone would get compounded
tagging supersets
rows rowing and vertical pulling to
pushing
uh leg stuff to arm stuff stuff like
that and not just antagonist here is a
bit of mimic
we're just uninvolved muscles right so
when one group of muscles is working
compound usually is best because it
knows a lot of muscles the other group
is resting and so on and so forth you do
take breaks every now and again but only
when you need
tough stuff works amazingly well and
combines cardio and weight's workout
into one
really is the tip of the spear as far as
most personal training is concerned
number eight track their progress all
right track their strength
track their work capacity for how many
reps they can do percent and not fall
off in reps too much
track their body composition in some
general way at least maybe belt
measurements
maybe you do skin folds maybe have them
go get a dexa or a bod pod every now and
again
two good things about tracking one you
can tell if your shit is working and you
can
see how to work it better and two it
gives the clients an understanding that
you're making objective progress like
sometimes our mind plays tricks on us
and you may like sort of feel like you
look the same as a client
three months later you're like kind of
like okay i don't know what happened
like i look similar but maybe i'm a
little leaner you do belt measurements
or just waist circumference and you're
like oh
i lost three and a half inches off my
waist holy crap but i guess my
thighs don't seem to be any smaller get
them into a bod pod or a dexa
you've gained seven pounds of muscle and
lost like five pounds of fat they're
like well that explains why my weight is
up two pounds
but like holy crap i'm doing it i'm
succeeding whereas before they might
like they might not really be able to
tell
now you don't do this super often as far
as body comp is concerned but tracking
progress in general is great
even just telling them so like you say
like hey you just squatted 135 for 10
they're like oh yeah i guess
is that good well when we started you
squatted 65 for 10.
that's not just gonna go in one year and
out the other for most people
they're gonna like they're going to bask
in that they're going to be like holy
crap
and they get to get home to their
husband it used to be like how was
personal training they were like i'm
fucking killing it in there apparently i
didn't even know my own strength and
they fucking darth vader
like lift up their husband like fool the
last time you
you know that's like a minor benefit of
a side effect
shit happens right that's not your
concern so number nine
check in often
with them now there's a ginger way to
put this but you basically are like hey
like
how do you think we're doing in here
what do you think about your progress
what do you think about your results
and what do you think about our goals
right because you're going to confirm
from earlier your goals with them you
know hey this is the goal right
like yes i want this i want 15 pounds by
thanksgiving and
sometimes they have different goals like
they lose 10 pounds they're like fuck
i'm shredded i want to get jack now
and they may tell you that or they may
kind of just like
people have a momentum thing and an
authority thing in which they're like oh
i committed to this i'd better do it and
then i'm getting in there like fuck i
wish i was getting jacked but i'm
getting lean
or and i don't care anymore every now
and again if like once every few weeks
you're like hey like
how are things doing we think my results
this and that on track a lot of times
they'll be like dude i fucking love it
this is great and those are the clients
that you know you're going to keep them
for a while
and they're going to refer tons of other
people to you but sometimes they're like
you know i'm glad you asked like do we
still have to keep getting leaner
because i kind of want to get jacked
you explore that territory with them
like okay like you know you're going to
get a little softer but you're going to
get really big and
much more muscular is that okay it's
going to take some time a few months of
dedication
and if they're like ah now fuck that i
don't want to get softer jk you know
it's just a
moment of weakness on the diet let's
just finish the thanksgiving cool but
they might be like no
totally i'm into all that then you
switch gears right because remember
you're there
as a singular purpose you are a service
provider to them
okay you do whatever it is they want you
get as close to that as a safe and
reasonable
that's it as if what they want has
shifted you've got to shift along with
them and you got to make sure you're on
the right track
at least perceptively getting them there
also bonus points this is kind of lame
this is not why we do this but it is a
thing
if you if you truly give a shit and you
ask about them
like you truly give a shit because you
do um but that makes people feel nice
you know like it's it's like you you get
on the airline or whatever you sit down
in your seat
and uh flight attendant is like doing
everything is okay are you comfortable
like whatever sometimes you're like
whatever get away from me i'm trying to
sleep uh but like
most of the time you're gonna feel like
at least a tiny feeling of like oh
well that's nice you know it's nice that
they asked me that you know most clients
aren't gonna be like
you're like hey what do you think about
a program like get out of my face i'm
training like what
wait i'm training you what the hell is
going on so it's nice it's at the very
minimum it's nice lastly the entire
process is this
you hit target distinct goals you've
determined with them and
vetted to make sure they're safe and
effective and
realistic hit those goals accomplish
them
an important point let them bask in them
fucking tell them
you are giving them props like dude
janice you fucking did it
you lost the 15 pounds you weigh 145
today
like because sometimes people are like
okay when for 145. it's like little kids
look at you like if
see if they're hurt or if they should be
proud you're like yes and she's gonna be
like
yeah i did you're right i did it i can't
believe it like that's awesome
you want people to feel great about it
because this is fitness and you want to
be a long-term thing
and just on a really just sheer human
emotional level like
they fucking accomplish something feel
fucking good about it because a lot of
people will accomplish
something and it'll just be like guess
on to the next like no
no no enjoy enjoy because that feeds
into the next if
all of your goals previously that you
remember accomplishing also came with a
ton
of positive emotions it's gonna feed
into passion and you like man
goal achieving is just a great thing if
you've achieved a ton of goals and after
everyone you're like man whatever right
shit
like a lot of times you're just gonna
lose steam and quit because why the hell
are you doing this anyway right
once they've passed a little bit let
reset the goals to whatever it is again
that you guys continue to negotiate
between you
and then repeat the process right on to
the next realistic goal
they accomplish it you bask and of
course on their way you give them props
when they're doing a good job
gently remind them that they could be
better on track if they're not during
etc etc
and then they accomplish it's all good
and that way it's a sequential goal
accomplishment process
sooner or later they're way better shape
they love training with you
unless they get hit by a bus they're not
firing you
or they like move to like dallas or
something who the fuck would move to
dallas
right unless they do that they're not
going anywhere
and better yeah they have like trillion
friends everyone except me
seemingly has like a trillion friends
co-workers and shit and when people get
in shape
nothing nothing in this world is
better than the referral mechanism of
someone you know getting in shape
you could see a video you could see a
commercial but you don't know all these
people in real life it could just be
like all like visual effects or you know
photoshop janus from accounting loses 30
pounds you're like
yo janice what are you doing
hook me up and she's like it's phil my
personal trainer
here's his card or here's his instagram
hit him up he's amazing
and then you get another client you do a
great job with them
more often than not that person opens up
their own network
of referrals pretty soon you're charging
500
an hour for personal training you're
smoking cigars into your clients faces
you don't give a shit anymore
and then a young personal trainer comes
by you doing a good job you're like
yes i was like you once that's it
mission accomplished folks
tune in next time for more information
you
