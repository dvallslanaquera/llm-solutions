meals is super super important so if you
eat 160 grams of protein per day and you
have four meals that you eat each meal
has 40 grams of protein or
thereabouts you eat breakfast you eat
lunch you train you eat dinner you relax

to sleep consistency is the key for
growth if you want to get huge and you
eat like one or two meals a day the shit

it could be next Point number eight you
want to eat at a surplus the thing about
getting big is that it requires you to
add size the only way you can add size
is if you eat more calories than you
burn
