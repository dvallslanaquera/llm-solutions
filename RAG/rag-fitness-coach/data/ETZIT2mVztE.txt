so how hard should you train on each set
to build muscle
i would say for the vast majority of
your sets the minimum level of effort
that you should be training at is
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i'm going to be
responding to a video by jeff
nippard uh it's either jeff or uh yeah
it might be a soft j but
in any case the video is entitled how
hard should you train to build muscle
the truth and in that video
he interviews five other experts mike
israel tell
john meadows steffy cohen eric helms and
greg knuckles
to get their opinion on this question so
in this video i'm asking five
highly qualified experts one of the most
important questions in fitness
how hard should we train and by uh how
hard should you train
they're specifically talking about your
effort level per set or in other words
how close to failure you should be going
and this is a really important question
because getting close enough to failure
on your sets is the primary stimulus
that triggers the entire muscle building
process
nothing else in your training plan or
your diet really has any significance at
all
unless you're training hard enough in
the first place to actually
stimulate those adaptive processes into
motion and so
the effort level that you put forth in
the gym is the absolute primary driver
of hypertrophy that everything else is
then built on top of
and i would say that on average most
people just don't train hard enough for
optimal muscle gains now i think the
best way to measure this is by using
rir which stands for reps in reserve in
other words
how many reps prior to muscular failure
are you stopping your set
so if you took your 10 rep max which
means a weight where if there was a gun
to your head and your life was literally
on the line
then 10 reps is the absolute maximum
number of reps that you could do in
proper form with that weight
um in that case doing nine reps with it
would be one rir
so one rep in reserve uh eight reps
would be two rir seven reps would be
three rar and so on
and if you went all the way to failure
and you did ten reps then it would be
zero rir
so i'm just gonna go through the five
different answers that were given and
i'm gonna highlight a few key things
from each one
because i think that each of them had
something unique to add into the mix and
uh greg doucette also did a video
response to this as well
and he gave his answer so i'm going to
include him uh in this as well
and then after that i'll give you my
answer to the question because in my
personal opinion there was one
key piece to the answer that wasn't
included so make sure to watch this
video all the way through and if you
want to check out jeff's full video then
i'll link it in the description box
obviously the credit goes to him because
ultimately he's the one who conducted

and let's jump into it so first up was
mike israel tell
and his basic position is that you need
to train hard enough to stimulate muscle
growth
but not so hard that your future
training sessions end up being
negatively impacted you have to train
hard enough to make gains
but not so hard that your next workout
suffers and it becomes a situation where
your next workout is unable to make you
gains
because you went too hard and i think
that's a really important point
because you can't just look at things on
an individual workout for workout basis
you have to think in terms of the
overall picture sure you can go into the
gym
and completely destroy yourself in one
session and perform
30 sets to failure to the point where
you need to be carried out of the gym on
a stretcher
and yeah you might stimulate greater net
muscle growth for that one
isolated session than you would if you
did say
18 sets with one to two reps in reserve
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
it's going to be the best approach
when you extrapolate it over the longer
term if you're creating excessive muscle
damage and joint stress
and just overall systemic fatigue for a
given workout then either you're going
to have to rest a lot longer to fully
recover
before you can train again at your
maximum capacity or you're going to go
back into the gym before you've had a
chance
to properly recover and so now that next
session is going to suffer because of
that
so it's about striking a good balance
between training hard enough to make
progress
but not so hard that you end up digging
an excessive hole into your recovery
each time that actually limits your
long-term progress not to mention
increases your chances for injury as
well and this is also why
i wouldn't advise taking advice from
certain youtubers out there who
recommend that you train
six days per week with high volume and
take every single set to muscular
failure and beyond
probably not ideal for the average
natural lifter out there
so next up was john meadows and the
unique aspect of his advice
is that he takes training experience
into account when you start
training i think we all realize that you
don't have to kill yourself
you don't need to take sets to failure
you don't need a crazy high amount of
volume
just by learning proper form you just
continue to get stronger and stronger
you make
nice little incremental increases in
strength
so basically for beginners he says it's
mostly just about making
basic linear increases in the amount of
weight that you're lifting which i've
talked about many times before okay you
don't need anything
fancy as a novice the focus should
really just be on building an overall
strength base on the key compound lifts
and the size will just automatically
follow um so you kind of move into an
intermediate stage where it's like okay
now i
i feel most of these movements pretty
good it's not as easy to get as strong
now
now i'm going to add a little bit of
volume i'm going to add a little bit of
intensity
the primary goal with that phase i think
is still
trying to get a little bit stronger
though it's just because you've kind of
went out of that newbie gain phase it
doesn't mean all of a sudden now you
don't care about progressing your lifts
then at the intermediate stage the focus
is still mainly on strength progression
but you can kind of start pushing things
a bit harder at that point
and i agree with that as well as i've
said many times before as well
unless you're an advanced lifter
building muscle is mostly just about
basic progressive overload in terms of
weight and rep
increases you just need to focus on
getting stronger in proper form period
you get to this advanced stage now all
of a sudden you've got to challenge your
body more
so some of those techniques that we like
to use an occasional cluster set and
occasional drop set maybe you you start
putting one of those in a workout
you know going back to our chest example
now maybe get on the machine and now
maybe do a cluster set to finish your
day or maybe do
a drop set to finish your day something
to really challenge the muscle
so then once you're more advanced let's
say you've put in somewhere between
about three to five years of consistent
proper training
at that point if you really want to see
further gains then you really have to
push the envelope your body is already
highly adapted to resistance training at
that point
it's a lot further away from its natural
set point
and so you've got to give it a very
strong incentive to pack on even more
muscle than it already has and so this
is where you can really start
challenging yourself
and incorporating higher intensity
techniques like uh going to failure more
often
and things like cluster sets you know
rest pause drop sets forced reps
cheat reps etc after that jeff talks to
steffy cohen
who basically says that if you want
serious results you cannot half-ass it
you need to be training intensely and
consistently pushing yourself
to your limits and the people with the
very best results
are the ones who push themselves the
hardest so
from my own experience what i've seen is
that the
best people in the game like great
accomplishments and great athletes
um come from working obsessively like
you don't
achieve greatness from casual effort you
know never once in my entire career did
i think that i come into the gym
thinking about what's the least i can do
to like get by
she also thinks that most people don't
train hard enough in general which is
something that i totally agree with
people rarely train hard enough and
they're usually in what i call the 50
50 zone where they
don't take themselves to like not
failure but like to an intensity that is
actually challenging ever rarely
and then they don't rest when they're
supposed to rest so it's like you end up
being in this 50
zone where you're always half-passing
all of your workouts because you're not
training hard enough when you when you
should and you're not resting when you
should
but she also mentions that context is
important okay this all assumes that
you're trying to be
the very best that you can be so you
know if your goal
is to just just train for health forget
about everything i just said
so keep that in mind too if you just
want to gain some muscle lose some fat
um and get stronger and build a decent
impressive physique but you're not
trying to do it at the very highest
level
then you don't necessarily need to go
all out here your training
should reflect the specific goal that
you're trying to achieve there's nothing
wrong when it all comes down to it
with training at say 75 of your total
effort in order to achieve a physique
that is
75 of your total potential it really
depends on you
it depends on your goals your life
priorities etc you know just because
somebody decides to
take up playing the guitar for example
that doesn't mean that they
automatically have to practice
eight hours a day and make it their goal
to become an elite level guitarist so
fitness is no different
and it's up to you to decide what you
ultimately want to get out of it

then make sure to hit that like button
below and post any questions that you
might have
down in the comments and then next up is
eric helms
who says that most of the time you
should be looking at about one to four
reps in reserve
in order to achieve significant results
and that if you really want to grow
you need to be challenging the existing
capability of the muscle
somewhere in the range of like a 5 to 10
rpe depending on
what your current goal is most the time
we're talking like you know
seven eight nine kind of thing he also
mentions that you can do this in a
variety of ways so you can do lighter
weight for higher reps
or heavier weight for lower reps or
something in between
the most important factor is just that
you're getting close enough to failure
on each set
which is something that i've also talked
about quite a bit recently that can be
pushing a low load set reasonably close
to failure or that can be
putting 80 on the bar and doing you know
it could be triples if you want if you
really want to do seven by three
go for it right you'd probably rather do
like four by six you know
then there's also the question of
leaving more reps in the tank
but performing more total sets versus
going harder on each set but then
reducing the volume to compensate
there's probably a huge continuum of
what's
equally effective if you do it
intelligently and that's why you can
have people on the more intensity side
of the spectrum or volume side of the
spectrum or
winning winning titles because it
probably doesn't make enough of a
difference to be a limit
to the actual practical outcomes within
a given range of
that continuum so eric basically says
that either approach can work
and can produce a similar outcome and i
would definitely agree with that
both based on my own personal experience
and just looking at other people's
results in the real world you know there
are
entire schools of training on either
side of the spectrum who swear by their
approach
and who have tons of lifters within
those camps who've been very successful
following either one i've had phases in
my life where i was
very far on the intensity side of the
spectrum doing
hit style training where the entire
approach is to go absolutely all out to
failure and beyond on every single set
with advanced techniques thrown in but
then to only do a very small number of
weekly sets and i've also done phases
where i was never going to failure and
leaving maybe two reps in the tank on
most sets but then doing higher volume
and both approaches absolutely do work
as long as you implement them correctly
and you achieve progressive overload
i've gotten great gains um as crazy as
it sounds by literally doing a single
set of 20 rep breathing squats to
failure
once per week for my quads and then on
the other hand i've also gotten great
gains by doing
18 sets for quads each week but at a
lower effort level per set
and then lastly is greg knuckles for
pure hypertrophy training
i think your best bet is generally to be
pretty close to failure i think you
should generally be within
two or so reps of concentric failure so
he recommends most sets being at least
two reps short of failure which i agree
with um i think three rar
for most exercises is just way too easy
and it's not going to produce optimal
results
and then after that he goes into more
guidelines for pure strength training
and for volume procession
but we won't go into that here because
uh this video is focused specifically on
hypertrophy
and on effort level per set as opposed
to volume
and then of course greg ducette made a
response to the video and his opinion
was
basically that these guys are all just
over complicating the entire thing
irr deloads reps in reserve
trade a bit hard don't train too hard
maybe take some time off build up some
reserve
don't go too hard because then you need
to back up if you go to failure well it
might hurt and you just don't want
and neurological failure and more
science science science
and so on in his opinion the simple
answer to the question of how hard to
train
is train harder than last time
that is the message stop telling people
a hundred different things
the first thing you tell everyone train
harder than last time
and i think if we're talking about the
average novice lifter out there in the
gym
and not the more advanced guys then he
does make a reasonable point
i don't think this whole question
requires a super complicated answer and
i think the average person out there
definitely will benefit from just being
told like look
stop training like a little pansy get
serious buckle down and start pushing
yourself close to your limits
if you want real results now as far as
the actual statement
train harder than last time goes harder
than freaking last time
i think that's good advice in the
overall sense okay you do need to train
harder than last time if you want to see
consistent muscle building results
but that statement is much more
applicable in the sense of progressive
overload
as opposed to effort level per set or
rir
rpe which is really what jeff's video
was about yes you absolutely do need to
train harder than last time
by increasing the workload in some way
whether it's lifting
a slightly heavier weight or performing
more reps with the same weight or by
using some other method of progressive
overload
but you don't need to constantly train
harder than last time
in the sense of proximity to failure on
each set you can't just
linearly increase uh your level of
effort on each set if you did that then
by the time you've been training for six
months you'd be going to failure on
every single set and doing four straps
rest pause and drop sets after every
single one yes
as you become more advanced over time
then you probably will need to gradually
shift
your effort level per set upward in the
overall picture but that shouldn't be
the goal
every time you go into the gym so train
harder than last time is a good motto
as long as it means training harder in
the sense of overall workload and not
necessarily rpe
or rir since it's not necessary or even
possible
to just continually increase your
proximity to failure with every workout
and while it might be true that some
people do over complicate this question
of how hard to train
just saying train harder than last time
that's way too vague for most people who
actually take their training seriously
and who want to follow
a systematized approach in order to
maximize the results i think the ideal
answer for most people
probably lies somewhere in the middle
between those two extremes
and now like i mentioned at the start i
also want to give my own answer to this
question and i'll try to keep this
only as complicated as it needs to be so
how hard should you train on each set to
build muscle
i would say for the vast majority of
your sets the minimum level of effort
that you should be training at
is two reps in reserve yes you can still
get a training effect from three reps or
um even four reps in reserve maybe even
five but ultimately
three to five rar is a pretty damn easy
way to train
and if you want real results if you want
to build significant muscle your
workouts just can't be that
easy so i wouldn't be leaving any more
than two reps in the tank on most sets
and keep in mind that that's a true two
reps in the tank meaning
gun to your head you could only perform
two more reps in proper form
so that's the minimum level and then i
think the ideal sweet spot for
hypertrophy
is one to two reps in reserve that's
where the bulk of your sets
should be centered and then once in a
while going all the way to concentric
muscular failure
and as you become more advanced over
time the proportion of sets that you
perform at the higher
end of that effort level that will need
to increase
i agree that most people don't train
hard enough and i think a lot of people
are just too caught up in the theory of
things
and they just need to get under the bar
grit their teeth and friggin lift
if you're not making this face on at
least some of your sets
if you don't feel a bit nervous before
at least some of your exercises
if you don't have moments during some
sets where you question why you're even
doing this to yourself
then assuming that you want to maximize
muscle growth you probably need to push
yourself harder
so that's the practical answer how hard
should you train about
one to two rar on most sets zero rar on
some sets here and there with the
overall effort level increasing
as you become more advanced but we also
have to keep in mind that
most novice lifters out there aren't
going to know exactly where they are in
relation to failure in the first place
since that does take time to learn and
on some exercises it can be harder to
gauge
so an even more basic answer would be to
go close to your maximum capacity
not all the way to complete failure stop
just a little bit shy of that point
and then lastly the other very important
part of the answer the one that i didn't
see anybody give in this particular
video
okay all the specifics aside reps in
reserve
rating of perceived exertion mesocycle
intensity volume continuum
undulating wave deload blah blah blah
etc okay once you're
actually implementing all of this how do
you actually know that you're in the
right zone and that you are in fact
training hard enough
and the answer is that you gauge that
through your improvements in training
performance
for the most part size and strength are
directly correlated
a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle and
so if you're consistently coming back to
the gym
stronger than you were last time so you
can either lift slightly more weight on
a given exercise or you can perform
an extra rep or two with the same weight
that is how you know that you trained
hard enough in the previous
session the reason why you're stronger
now is because the effort that you
exerted in that previous session
was sufficient to trigger new muscle
building adaptations the muscle grew
and now you are stronger because of that
so all the specific guidelines aside in
terms of how hard you should train
the bottom line is that if you're
consistently getting measurably stronger
over time
then you are on the right track that is
how you know that you are in fact
training hard enough
because if you weren't training hard
enough then you wouldn't be getting
stronger the adaptations wouldn't be
getting triggered
and so you would just stay in the same
place now
we can talk about optimization you know
even though you're getting stronger and
making some progress
maybe you could be making even faster
progress but again this is just meant as
a general overarching answer
progressive overload is the underlying
driver of muscle growth and so if over
time you're achieving progressive
overload your trading performance is
consistently getting better and better
then by definition
you are training hard enough and this is
also why it's so important for you to
track your workouts on paper
so that you can directly see if your
training performance is improving over
time
so that's my hopefully relatively simple
answer
train at one to two reps in reserve on
most sets zero reps in reserve on some
sets
as you become more advanced you probably
need to push yourself harder if you want
to make new gains
and if you're consistently getting
stronger then that's how you know that
you are
in fact training hard enough so thanks
