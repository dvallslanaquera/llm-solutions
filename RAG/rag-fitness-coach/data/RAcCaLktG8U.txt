that's the real reason why people make
netty or not videos
and that's the real reason why people
watch them it actually has
very little to do with helping people
maintain realistic expectations
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to address the whole
natty or not subject and explain why
it's not something that i've ever talked
about here on this channel
um i get messages from people all the
time over on my instagram
asking whether i think so and so is
natural or enhanced and so i figured
that it was worth talking about here
now to preface this just so that you
don't get the wrong impression from what
i'm about to say
i definitely do think that being a fake
natty uh claiming that you're natural
when you're actually using peds
i think that that is an extremely lame
and misleading thing to do
being enhanced and just not saying
anything about it that's one thing
i'm still not a fan of that either but
especially for those guys who are just
straight up lying about it i mean i
really just have no idea
how those people even look at themselves
in the mirror to be honest and yes that
includes
trt or sarms or growth hormone or any
performance enhancing drug
so i have no respect whatsoever for fake
naturals
and if i could just press a button and
publicly expose every single one of them
i would press that button without even
thinking twice however that said
as much as i am against fake natties
there are a few reasons why i don't
specifically make
natty or not videos on this channel so
the first reason is because
very simply when it comes to those more
middle ground cases where
it's not completely obvious either way
the truth is that i just don't know the
answer and regardless of how much
knowledge and how much experience
somebody else might have
the reality is that they don't know the
answer for sure either
they can make their most educated guess
but there's always going to be a margin
for error
now if somebody out there is carrying
just a ridiculous amount of muscle
while being totally shredded at the same
time and their ffmi
is just totally off the charts then okay
that's a bit different or if somebody
has gone through
um you know a sudden significant
transformation really quickly
while also showing obvious signs of ped
use then that's also a different
scenario
but when it comes to those more sort of
borderline cases which is what most
people are
going to be the most interested in
seeing videos about where someone has
that super impressive physique but it's
still conceivable that they could be
natural
in that case the truth is that no one
really knows for sure because the fact
is that genetic outliers do exist in
this world you take a large enough
sample size
and there's gonna be just those
ridiculous genetic freaks in that
extreme
upper percentile those one in a million
physical specimens who are able to
accomplish things
that 99.99999 of other people
can't uh just like it's exceptionally
uncommon for someone to be able to
run 100 meters in under 10 seconds there
are a select few human beings on this
planet with just the right
muscle fiber distribution and just the
right body structure and mechanics
that when you combine that with an
extreme work ethic over a long period of
time
they're going to be one of the very few
people who can achieve that
and that goes for all areas of life and
so it only stands to reason
that there are also going to be those
extreme body composition outliers
who can put on abnormal amounts of
muscle while maintaining abnormally low
body fat at the same time
now i am not denying for one second that
there are
plenty of legit fake natties out there
and that
those guys are the worst but believe it
or not there are also plenty of legit
lifetime natural lifters with very
impressive physiques and the issue
is that outside of long-term precise
drug testing that just isn't going to be
practical
in the first place and that nobody's
obligated to do anyway there's just no
way to definitively know
whether someone really is a fake natural
or if they're just
an extreme genetic specimen and then on
top of that another huge
challenge is that the way somebody looks
in online pictures and videos
that can differ quite a lot from how
they look in person which is something
that
i've talked about many many times before
you really can't judge someone's size
online through a screen
and so if someone is really lean and
then they have that ideal bodybuilding
structure in terms of muscle shape and
insertions and joint size
they're going to look massive in photos
and videos even if they aren't actually
that big
and then combined with the leanness it's
gonna look really suspect and then when
you combine that
with optimal lighting conditions which
really can make a shocking difference
you know just having the light source
coming from directly behind you or
directly in front of you that can make
it look like you barely even lift
whereas if you shift the light source uh
to coming from the side or coming from
the top down
then all of a sudden it looks like all
you've been doing is training and
tracking macros for the past 10 years
straight
then you add proper posing the right
angles having a pump putting on a bit of
oil
you slap some instagram filters on it
and that finished product that you see
online can be
very very different from what that
person would look like if you just
removed all of those things
so the bottom line is that with very
good genetics combined with a very good
work ethic to maximize that genetic
potential
combined with the sort of illusion of
fully optimized pictures and videos when
you put
all of that together there's just no way
to know for sure
whether someone in that more middle
ground zone is truly natty or not no
matter how confident you might be
there's always going to be the
possibility of being wrong which brings
me to the second point
which is that publicly calling someone
out for being enhanced
if in reality they're actually natural
that is actually a very serious thing
and it has very real consequences for
that person especially if you're calling
them out
in front of a really large audience now
a lot of people will say
you know they shouldn't be upset about
it it's just a compliment but
if someone is legitimately natural and
says they're natural and then you make a
video saying that they're enhanced
sure it's a compliment on some level but
that person has already been accused
probably a million times before of being
on peds
in their own comment sections by other
people and possibly in
other natty or not videos and they
already know that they're in amazing
shape they really don't need more
validation in that area you know your
one extra little compliment isn't really
going to change anything for them
and really what you're doing if they are
in fact natural
is you're publicly calling them a liar
uh you're potentially accusing them of
breaking the law depending on what you
think they're using
uh you're discrediting their
accomplishments because you're saying
that they used peds to achieve their
physique when in reality maybe they just
trained a really hard and dieted their
ass off for the past 12 years straight
to get to where they are
and you are reducing their credibility
in the eyes of their followers
which harms their reputation on some
level and even could harm their business
on some level as well
not to mention that all the backlash
that they end up receiving
that could affect them mentally as well
so sure it's a compliment
but if you're wrong about them being
enhanced then there's also a lot of
genuinely negative things that come
along with that and let me know in the
comments what you think about this
are natty or not videos somewhat
unethical because legit naturals are
inevitably
uh gonna end up being falsely accused in
the process or is it just fair game
either way because
people are entitled to give their
opinions but once again i'm not saying
that there aren't
real fake nadis out there i'm not saying
that those people aren't
total frauds for claiming to be natural
when they're not
and i recognize that a lot of these
natty or not videos um they do end up
exposing
a percentage of those guys which i do
think is a good thing you know i have no
sympathy whatsoever
for guys who are using peds and are
blatantly lying about it
but my philosophy is that because i can
never know for sure
whether someone is truly natural or
enhanced unless it's just totally off
the charts obvious
because there's always going to be that
possibility of someone just being an
extreme genetic outlier probably also
with an extreme work ethic
given that fact in my view it's better
to just not say anything
because i believe that it's not my right
to
gamble on someone's reputation like that
if the choice was between making
say ten natty or not videos and being
right in nine of them
but then being wrong and one of them and
raking in all those
views and clicks and subscribers and ad
revenue i personally would still rather
make no videos at all
because i don't think that it's right
for me to sacrifice that one truly
natural guy and publicly tarnish him
when he has nothing to do with those
other nine guys not to mention that he
has no realistic way
to prove otherwise you know the amount
of testing that someone would have to
undergo
to prove that they're natural just isn't
going to be practical in most cases
so you're basically accusing someone of
something and then leaving them
with no recourse and with no way to
prove otherwise
now the common argument is that natty or
not videos are valuable
because they help the viewers maintain
realistic expectations
now that's true to some extent but also
keep in mind that pretty much anybody
who's being featured in these videos
if it's a legit middle ground case that
could lean either way
that person's physique isn't going to be
obtainable by the vast majority of
people anyway
whether they're enhanced or they're
actually natural most people who rise to
the top of
fitness social media natty or not
usually not always but
usually they're gonna have to have
reasonably above average genetics
if someone has the type of physique that
stands out from the crowd
that stands out from the millions of
other people vying for attention on
these platforms
they're usually going to need to have
those upper percentile genetics in order
to get to that position
so if someone gets put into a natty or
not video and the verdict
is not natty people are going to say
okay great now i know that this isn't
naturally obtainable
thanks for letting me know but if the
verdict is natty
that doesn't all of a sudden mean that
every natural lifter is going to be able
to look like that guy in fact it's much
more likely
that the vast majority of natural
lifters still won't be able to look like
that
if that person looks good enough to the
point that everybody is questioning
their natural status
so in practice these videos probably
don't actually change much
in the real world the honest no [ __ ]
reason why people make natty or not
videos
is because those videos are extremely
effective when it comes to getting views
and subscribers it's not because
they care so much about their audience
and they want to help people maintain
realistic expectations no it's because
those videos
help to grow their viewership that's why
those videos get made and the reason why
people watch natty or not videos
is mainly because those videos are
really entertaining okay human beings
are
by nature social gossipy creatures that
like watching people talk about other
people
which is fine you know i'm not even
saying that negatively it's just the way
it is
but that's really what it comes down to
sure maybe you really are curious about
whether that person in the video is
natty or not
but at the end of the day these videos
are primarily entertainment
in practice for the most part these
videos don't actually help people
with their fitness programs in any
direct quantifiable way because again
most of the physiques being featured in
those videos are probably not going to
be obtainable by the masses
whether that person is natty or not now
everybody out there has their own
moral stance on this if other people
want to make natty or not videos
then that's up to them i honestly don't
really care that much but those are the
reasons why i personally don't
if i could somehow know with 100
certainty whether somebody was natural
or enhanced
then yeah i probably would make natty or
not videos because i'd be more than
happy to expose the frauds out there
while giving credit to the real naturals
and while expanding my channel in the
process but i just can't do it
because i'm not comfortable with the
consequences of possibly getting it
wrong
and you make enough of these natty or
not videos and you're definitely going
to be wrong from time to time
i've been training naturally since i was
in my teens i know what it's like to put
in that consistent dedicated work
over a very long period of time without
taking any shortcuts and i'm not going
to run the risk of
possibly discrediting somebody who's
also gone that same
route so thanks for watching guys if you
