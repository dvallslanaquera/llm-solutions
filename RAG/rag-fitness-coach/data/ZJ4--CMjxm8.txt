incline push-up very well executed this
is a great movement for folks not quite
strong enough to do regular push-ups yet
the benefit of an incline push-up is as
you get lower the exposure of your
strength to gravity increases because
you're going from more vertical to more
horizontal and thus it challenges your
muscles more at longer muscle lengths
during the stretch for both triceps
front delts and chest making this a very
very good choice for movement especially
if you can be challenged in anywhere
between five and 30 reps with incline
push-ups
