what happened there
i feel humiliated
hey folks dr mike here for rp
here's the deal a lot of people been
talking mad smack take that youtube
algorithm that phases out swear words
early
and it turns out some people have lost
faith
in their king's ability to eat more than
everyone else so an eating challenge has
been brought to my table
and guess what i'm dealing with it in
the only way i know how ruthlessly
with a victory the food of choice is the
poke bowl
constructed by yours truly charlie jung
and uh we got some awesome competitors
today
here are their introductions
boom
[Music]
i don't know how i'm gonna perform but i
can say some things about my competitors
jared feather is just a fucking waste of
time in general as a person eating him
under the table is not even a fucking
challenge to me you should open and
close my eyes that easy
ethan simply he's an actor whatever
highway first of all shit is all fake
second i'm not a big fan of his work a
lot of his movies be great shit
charlie john never heard of him seems
like a nice guy probably can't eat
anything
jacob chameleon that's a serious guy who
can eat right eizer by jean they eat a
lot of food
uh but i still feel like i have an
advantage uh
apparently he's not taking me that
seriously who else is in this challenge
oh yeah me i'm gonna win that shit
you'll watch this so yeah my competition
uh
very good uh i think that
mike can eat some food uh but i my
chances are high
am i gonna win i don't know i'm not
feeling so good about that
i definitely know who's gonna lose
though that motherfucker
mike fuck that smack all the time i
think mike
might have the worst smack talk to
performance ratio out of all of us the
fact that it's 45 minutes long is
stressing me out a little bit
because some people could take breaks
and pace themselves
it might be detrimental to me i'm here
to make mike look good
my man he brought me here to uh you know
make sure that i eat less than him so
bring up the rear it's impossible to
make mike look good
so good luck
all right so here's the deal it's a 45
minute eating challenge
start eat as much pokey as you can we
put them in these little bowls each one
of these has about 30 grams of protein
from fish
and about 100 grams of carbs from white
rice
how many bowls can jared feather eat
probably not that many
but somebody else can probably eat a
bunch probably me because i'm the man
folks place your bets now
and we'll see where this goes three
two one begin
the rice do fish ratio should be higher
though
you sealed your own steak
first bowl finished jared feather
taking the lead
you're using white trashcan that's not
fair that's true
let's go jacob i heard all that talk
that's that talk
and i'll talk when you're on the street
charlie
first of all i'm not done yet
jared feather second bowl
ethan first bowl ethan your coach just a
whole bowl ahead of you
come on brother yeah but
he's not gonna get that shit
thank you oh this is big man oh mike
finally finished his first goal
the tortoise and the hair two for yasha
two two i love the suffering face
boom that's for simply
two bowls how are you feeling i've
overdone it
one point one bulls and he's already
poking at it
i'm letting i'm letting it know
there's no way you i might just come
back at 40 40 minutes just eat another
one right and make everyone feel like
shit
you're embarrassed fuck are you looking
at
you're weak motherfucker that's what i'm
looking at god damn
somebody i used to think that was a
friend did you ever gosh
i'm struggling and i hope eating one
more will definitely go down
oh i used to weigh 550 oh i can eat a
lot a bunch of pack of lies
i'm just going to film charlie for rest
of this it's amazing
he ate
is that a reversal
just a burp folks stay calm be really
impressive
mike is three down
[Music]
he's um competition but uh i think he's
still itching
charlie i didn't think you would be at
last
[Music]
[Laughter]
you do this you start with that don't
swallow it just you know get it ready
challenge over it's official
last place
with how many balls did you eat
let's say two no one and a half
one and two thirds ish
fourth place two and a third two and
three quarters maybe three quarters
thank you that's generous
you know third place uh three
[Music]
second place second place i'm not used
to taking because i'm used to victory
you guys all know that
thing is i ate three and a quarter
my wife finishing up the rest i consider
this uh
you know for the people of the world a
victory really and surprise the new one
fuck mike is herself he sucks he's a
bitch fuck that humble champion shit
what'd you eat my where's the other one
i
pause i can eat this right now if i
wanted to i'm gonna have some ice cream
though it's in the freezer because i'm
still hungry
don't say ice cream ice cream for
victory
folks eating challenges no one really
ever wins so i don't consider jared a
winner
at all period um and uh if you think you
can eat more than me
you're probably right but if you want to
bring that heat
i'm here for all comers all day baby all
shapes all sizes
i'm honestly just uh literally
disappointed by charlie's performance
me me too honestly that's all i can
think about
how poorly you perform watching charlie
eat was
actually depressing so i remember in the
uh earlier training you did say you
idolized me
how do you feel now that hasn't happened
retracted immediately the wall of story
is charlie young will disappoint you
sooner than later
probably sooner thanks for tuning in see
you for more training stuff
diet stuff and maybe another eating
challenge when we can scoop charlie off
the floor
see you guys then
[Music]
you
