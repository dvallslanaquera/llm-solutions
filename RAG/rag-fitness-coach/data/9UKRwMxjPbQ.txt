okay
mikhail israel here for renaissance
periodization today
we're russian yes terrell taylor torre
taylor torres here two takes
we're here with taylor torre very
difficult name to say for russian man
da da va so she's here to train her
glute today
singular jared just who is she
taylor is my client she just actually
took the overall
in the wellness category at the npc
since city
is that last weekend or two weeks ago
last weekend so she's actually starting
her messa cycle today it is monday after
the competition
just got done with the awesome d-load
and she's ready to uh
get fried by this russian man training
guys
now
[Music]
alright folks because this is a glute
centered workout
doesn't mean we're just training glutes
exclusively sometimes the compound
basics
that hit some hamstrings and hit some
adductors and hit some quads are also
really good so technically speaking this
is going to be a glute and ham workout
which means
first up we have deficit sumo deadlifts
which are awesome for the glutes and
they hit the adductors as well a ton
sometimes even the hamstrings a little
bit after that we're going to do stiff
legged deadlifts
again for the glutes but also the hams
significantly lastly we're gonna finish
off
with dumbbell lunges for pretty high
reps
maybe we're gonna superset to a sumo
squat
holy crap glute annihilation i've said
that in a few contexts folks
let's get to training only positivity
you're an influencer now
you better be kidding that was lame as
fuck
yes excellent
tyler beautiful big breath in there you
go
breath out oh yeah good don't let
don't let the chest cape first remember
you're opening your hips setting there
you go
hips down beautiful
pop yeah yeah
go down yes
glutes glutes glutes exactly perfect
good stuff control we want quality reps
only it doesn't matter how many you get
each one has to be good
up breathe out good
[Music]
good one more left one last good rep
big chest yes good stuff
set it up as if you're going to do
another one control
knees out excellent boom
that's it good stuff very very good
all right folks if you're training out
of your garage or
you're training in just a minimal
equipment space you know still when
we're filming this right now covered 19
is still a thing
and yeah it stinks right so let's just
get that out of the way but how can you
improvise well with some basic movement
we have a barbell here we have some
plates we have dumbbells
one cool trick you can use one easy
trick
three just click on this ad just kidding
one trick we have
is to vary stances and grip positions
so you say okay i have a bar i can bench
press it
well you can do wide grip medium close
if you have a adjustable bench you can
do wide medium close on incline
there are six exercises for your chest
and they're all compounded hardcore
really awesome what about for things
like deadlifts you have regular
deadlifts
we can have wider stance hands out
deadlifts
we can have sumo deadlifts and we can
have sumo deficit deadlifts and that's
just the beginning
so be creative don't use all these
variations at the same time
pick one or two of them use them for a
mesocycle or two when they get a little
stale on you pick another one or two
and then you're good to go and hey after
a few months kovid should be
please over by then we can go back to
real gyms and sit on padded machines
and drink protein shakes and everything
will be great
folks taylor here has essentially
a lawless stiff-legged deadlift
technique now
we're not all made to be this flexible
and this mobile
sure as hell i'm not jared's close
taylor is on a level all her own use
this video and her technique as the gold
standard to aspire to
try to keep your back super tight as you
notice you will be the knees super far
back
and the deeper you can get with a tight
back and tight knees the better
don't try to copy this at home because
you will probably break in half
but this is something to aspire to maybe
you know when we're all have robot
bodies in 40 years we can also
stifle like a deadlift like this check
it out
hope it keeps that lower back tight
beautiful good stuff
gentle touch and up okay i'm not gonna
lie this is gonna make it really fucking
hard but the last thing
is don't let these knees come in at all
they should be opening as you're pushing
back
open open hips back it's gonna make a
little harder
beautiful knees open good stuff
good or close
yes beautiful taylor
good stuff awesome
[Music]
there you go
good one last one
good hips yes there you go
gonna set it down like you're doing
another one as if you're gonna do
another one
milked out excellent that's it
good stuff damn those are the
toughest five reps or what i've ever
seen in my life yeah
the total distance covered under tension
is like 50 lateral raises for one rep
lunges everybody loves to do them
mom loves them grandma loves him i did
one of those john edward ghost talk type
of things
my great-grandmother loved to do lunges
i didn't even know
so we're gonna honor our relatives today
namaste
by doing a fuck zillion lunges sorry
taylor good luck keep going
around the can keep it going good thing
about the street is there's lots of
street to do lunges on
slow up no breaks between
there you go as soon as you step step
good
again good again
good stay upright we won't count them
good four more one
two control three control
slow and four dumbbells down
very good walk over right now right now
right now and
after lunges we're actually gonna do a
superset
to sumo squats why
because the lunges definitely
pre-fatigue the glutes like crazy
and then the glutes tend to be the
limiting factor on sumo squats after
which is a great way to use less load on
sumo squats
but accomplish a ton of muscle
activation a ton of metabolic
sequestration
has that for a word to get the glutes
going
folks let's do it go go go go you got
this
little wider stinks here big upright
chest
i thought you were supposed to be some
kind of champion you're out here winning
stuff let's go
good keep it moving be tough
more stuff control the decent trick
be tough more
again let's go upright posture
up very good move again there is no rest
today
keep going good another one right now
this is where you make muscle gains now
again go
up two more go come on only good
technique
up big chest last one now
pause up very good rack
good stop good stop
feel free feel free to
die of old age you also have grass if
you like grass
and street
[Laughter]
taylor i can't believe you're so weak 45
i thought you were a physique athlete
you're supposed to be doing like 300
pounds
in austria we say kilograms this is
pathetic where you from you from croatia
that makes sense
so you might notice that me and mike
aren't really uh pushing her maybe the
way we pushed
some of the videos that you saw in the
past that's because as i mentioned in
the intro
she just came off of a d-load she did
her show she was pretty fatigued
this mess of cycle we are entering into
higher volumes again after that deload
so since it's week one instead of going
right to just ultra crazy fucking
somebody up you kind of want to ease
into the mesocycle
so she definitely pushed herself pretty
hard on lunges and she pushed herself
pretty hard on the single squat set that
you saw at the end
but we did one set of that and you're
like one set what the hell but you know
two three sets of the first exercise two
three sets of the second and then one
set of lunges
seven total sets that's a pretty good
mate or
minimum effective volume for that first
week of training we can just do that
the fuck is it well it's a full one oh
this one
okay bullshit or something all right you
ready
you gotta hit it and we'll go out to the
outro oh shit scott ready
guys thank you so much we're practicing
our wellness poses
i don't really have what would be called
pizzazz by the judges
taylor has plenty jared you're doing all
right for yourself you're not even in
your pose how you supposed to get judged
i
had to get out of it what's wrong with
you anyway thanks for tuning in
um see you next time except jared has
something to say one last thing i want
to say about
this amazing client taylor underwent uh
how long of uh how many pounds of fat
loss was that uh like 37
37 pounds of fat loss she did the
majority of her work before
we ever even worked together was a two
or three year process
she was very meticulous and intelligent
about it utilized a lot of the same
principles we used at rp
and it was amazing beautiful yeah maybe
you can uh pull up that before and after
on the screen and you can see what that
looks like it's really cool so
it's very inspirational and it's i'm
glad that she's here with us
