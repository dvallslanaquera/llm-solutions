you want to start you know nice and high
and get real good tension there on the
heel and then move your feet maybe a few
inches down and see how that feels and
you'll have to go all the way down each
time to really trial it so for me my
personal best this is sort of the gym we
own here and this is my machine so I
already know where to put my feet watch
my heels as I descend all the way down
they're still touching and powerful and
if I moved even a centimeter down they
would come off so finding the lowest
possible part of the pad which still
lets you push the heels gives you
maximum knee flexion and maximum quad
hypertrophy
