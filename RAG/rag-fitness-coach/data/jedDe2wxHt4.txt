hey folks Dr Mike here from Renaissance
periodization here's another episode of
BS not gonna say the real world word
shut up Scott the video guy
fucker we're keeping all this in yeah
[Music]
it's like we're doing the the this whole
Channel together remember there's just
me I'm Dr Mike it's my show
where were we carnivore is the
healthiest diet
unlikely to be true
why
here's the thing
some people have gone to the carnivore
diet because they have crazy food
sensitivities or allergies and maybe to
lots of common foods and maybe to lots
of plant foods and the carnivore diet
has essentially been an Elimination Diet
for them and has caused them nearly or
100 symptom relief
and that's awesome it's like he's got
some shitty dice rolled your way you got
to do what you got to do two people that
come to mind on that is Jordan Peterson
and Michaela Peterson is that his
daughter's name Caleb Pearson and I
think they both do like an all meat diet
and it works for them and they've tried
other diets and it was just like their
bodies were falling apart total respect
it is what it is
bought for the rest of us
and I don't mean us and some it's just
them two and the rest of us for most
people almost all humans
veggies fruits whole grains and healthy
plant fats like olive oil Etc
can be super Health boosting parts of
our diets
and the research confirming this is
Monumental one of the worst things in
the world to see is when you got like a
crazy psychotic carnivore advocate
that's trying to hashtag science he's
like having you read the studies on
anti-nutrients shut the fuck up
motherfucker you read two studies
yesterday was the first two studies you
ever read your life do you know how much
research exists on how healthy fruits
veggies whole grains and healthy fats
are for you oh my oh my God Reams it
would fill textbooks
it is just not a cogent thing to say
that everyone should be eating only meat
some people for special circumstances
absolutely many people if they want to
live a life in also a pretty healthy way
and they're supplementing some fiber or
maybe getting a greens powder in there
maybe a few veggies here and there but
mostly eating uh animal products that's
totally a fine way to live and it's
pretty healthy not the healthiest but
it's totally cool and if that's your jam
that's your jam but pretending that it's
the healthiest diet for everyone is um
gee whiz there's a term for that but let
me make it in another way this will be a
short ass video
before
you start eating only cows remember that
the Bulls can be eaten too and so can
their shit
bullshit nine listen to Arnold stop it
stop with this carnivore you've got to
eat your veggies into drinking milk in
your beer
beer that word has no r in it beer
I'll see you guys next time
