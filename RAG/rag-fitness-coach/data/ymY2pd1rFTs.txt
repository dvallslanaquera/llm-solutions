so this isn't
awful uh is if you are trying to follow
this workout at home folks take your
feet and bring them in substantially for
the rock I would bring them in at least
six inches on each side point the toes
out a little bit more and sink down
vertically so that your butt touches
your calves at the bottom pause there
for a second and then come back up
that's how you do belt squats for
maximum results I don't know if the rock
is hurt again that's always a good
excuse but unless you're hurt there are
better ways to do this
