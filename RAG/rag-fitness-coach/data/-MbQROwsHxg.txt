folks i'm here i'm at the rp gym i've
made it i'm so excited
i'm camera shy today oh ah just kidding
buddy
look it's dr james
from
the youtube channel
with
q a with dr james and dr mike
this motherfucker lives in montana
flew his dumbass out
and now he's filming videos here mostly
adult films i've seen your body of work
one of the few times
[Music]
and and a hell of a body it is you may
be asking yourself how do i build enough
muscle to look like an adult film star
like dr james good news james has the
answer
first off i got laid over in minneapolis
so fuck you delta
i'm on no sleep i had to take a shuttle
at 5 45 to get here
i'm a delta elite premium plus sky mile
super plus
medallion elite how dare you yeah well i
had a layover in minneapolis horrible
city by the way i'm just kidding
all you minneapolis folks
he's going to be giving you some tidbits
about how maybe you can prioritize this
and that uh he knows a ton of shit uh
james says geez i don't know shit i only
know this
that's enough and that's enough
cut
the least informative intro not my long
shot we've done way worse
[Music]
all right so for my first exercise
normally i like to bias some of the
heavier rep ranges like the five to ten
but for me personally and especially for
lats i really don't feel like that's a
good sfr range for me
so my first set i'm going to shoot for
about eight to 15 reps so kind of
somewhere in between the 5 to 10 and 10
to 20 ranges that we typically recommend
that's like my heavy for these vertical
pulling movements and then i'll move on
to some lighter stuff after i get this
stuff done
so this is actually the second mesocycle
of a phase that i'm running so i've
already done a whole mesocycle and in
that first mesocycle i'll tend to stick
with just a couple main variations that
i tend to do on the heavy-ish side so
the first time around what i would do is
the same general movement here at my
house i had to do it in the pull downs
and then i would add things like down
sets and i would do the same thing for
my other exercises like squats i would
do squats five to ten and then add some
down sets in mesocycle number two which
is what i'm in right now
i don't use the same movements quite as
much and i start to increase some
variance into this mesocycle so instead
of doing the same lift for top sets and
down sets i'll do one exercise
by itself and then i'll add some new
exercises because i need a little bit
more variation in the exercises
themselves and i like to introduce that
moderate to higher rep range midway
midway through this whole macro cycle so
in this mesocycle number two i'm adding
a little bit of variation of which
exercises i do to get my volume and i'm
also varying the rep ranges that i did
from the previous message
[Music]
and again for you guys who have long
arms like me so i know you're used to
watching dr mike he's a little bit more
stout and compact
hopefully you can see i got a pretty big
wingspan so some of the things that mike
and i do are a little bit different and
for me
the biggest bang for my buck on these
pulling movements for vertical is
usually an underhand grip maybe a little
bit more on the narrow side and again
focusing on this kind of downward elbow
movement rather than out to the side
elbow so if you have gumby anthropometry
like me give that a shot see if it helps
your back training and at all
many of you may be asking
what is this machine made of and some of
you may already be assuming rubber
foam steel wrong
they took sex pure sex and melted it
down reconstructed into this machine
that's how come it feels like that and
like it's funny that you and i can both
get a full range of motion on the same
machine because usually it's like either
it's good for you or it's good for me
this one even my lanky ass can get you'd
have to be like seven foot six yeah at
the bottom they made this for like andre
the giant shaquille o'neal
speaking of shaq
oh
[Music]
oh
that's heavy
i'm heavy
all right that's it for assisted
pull-ups so in my previous mesocycle i
would have done down sets of those this
time i'm going to add a little bit of
variation by doing some lat prayers so
usually
i can't equate them for sets one to one
typically i'll do a little bit less of
something like that with down sets
because it's heavier this i usually will
do an extra set or two just because it's
lighter so i'm gonna do about three sets
of lap prayers for the rest of this lat
volume for on this
get out of here
stop it this is private
did you want to see my cock nah
we've got to zoom in a lot
[Music]
all right so you guys have seen dr mike
do these lat prayers i'm sure a whole
bunch on his instagram and his training
videos i do mine slightly differently
just because i get a better sfr with a
slightly different technique so what i'm
gonna do is go off to the side here i'm
going to again take a little bit more of
a narrow grip and i'm going to do more
of a hard elbow than a soft elbow what i
mean by that is i'm going to keep my
arms mostly straight now it's almost
impossible to really lock them out but
i'm going to keep mostly straight and
i'm going to just tilt forward just a
little bit and again what i'm trying to
do is emphasize
this downward elbow kind of movement and
really using my lats and not just trying
to swing it around so i'm going to
really come down
and pull it to here
slightly different than you might have
seen dr michael other people do it but
this is what fits my anthropometry just
a little bit better so that's why i'm
gonna do this so my goal is to get about
10 to 20 reps and do three sets
[Music]
uh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
oh
that's a nice setup
i can really feel it working
those lats
great movement if you guys really
struggle to get a lot of like soreness
or disruption in your back training
really nice one to add on
[Music]
sounds like somebody's farting over
there sorry
goddammit
it was like a very rhythmic farting
sound i'm done farting
a very uh gastrointestinally challenged
elephant
is dumbo still sick
i also like to do this
with a pause
just to help increase kind of my mind
muscle connection and sfr to the
movement i think sometimes people just
kind of
get lazy with this and just kind of go
up and down bounce it out adding the
pause really helps kind of
keep the emphasis on the lats
and not just winging it around with your
shoulders and arms quite so much
[Music]
so dr micah is a pretty fun piece of
equipment that i want to try this isn't
something i can do in my home gym
usually i would do like a dumbbell row
cable row something like that but he has
a nice camber bar and like a chest
supported row set up so i'm gonna go
fuck with that see how it feels
people have been asking me dr mike how's
your mass face going yeah what do you
think yeah hold on
nice
yes
classic
i already did a row
heavy uh back workout that was my first
back workout of this week so this is the
second workout so before i did a lot of
heavier row movements on this one this
is going to be my lighter row movement i
haven't used this exact setup before so
i'm going to air conservatively with the
25s here and see how it goes but i'm
going to shoot for 10 to 20. with this
particular movement some people like to
really lean into it like a flexion row
some people will do it more strict
either way is fine i'm going to probably
do somewhere in the middle where i'm
going to lean forward and lean back just
to ensure that my shoulders are moving
because a lot of times with rowing
people's scapulas kind of lock up they
do one good one and then they kind of
get locked up like this and then and
then they make nonsense reasons for it
like fucking lock the scaps bro yeah
like just fucking do it so for some
people unlocking the scaps um uh if
sorry if you flex your trunk it kind of
just unconsciously cues you to flex the
scaps out a little bit so i'm gonna do
kind of a little hybrid technique and
see how it feels
[Music]
hey
not bad
i like that feel that right in the
in the middle
for some people like if you really lean
into these you'll feel a lot in your
erectors which isn't good or bad it's
just a different way of doing it for me
i'm really trying to hit that upper mid
back
and that's exactly where i'm feeling it
on this so i feel like i'm in a good
position here
folks
i've been dieting and i just hit me like
a brick wall between the shitty flight
layover getting stuck
and dieting just whoa
oh we gotta get through it let's do it
[Music]
foreign
oh that's a wrap on that one
all right
hey guys
i'm already done with my workout i got a
few other things going on
no more dr mike cameos
so i'll see you guys next time
something
is off
you just don't feel like yourself
your favorite hobbies don't seem as fun
as they used to be
food doesn't taste as good
even your loved ones reject you
try the rp custom training templates
you'll feel like your old self again
everything will be more fun
food will taste great
loved ones will take you back in
statements not evaluated by the fda
temples will only make you more muscular
nothing else guaranteed
all right so next one we're going to do
is some spider curls with the easy bar
on an incline bench
i've actually already done biceps two
other times this week the first was on
the first day i did some mile reps cable
curls
the other one i did is my more heavy
bicep training where i do barbell curls
for like 8 to 15 temporary excuse me rep
range this is meant to be one of my
lighter bicep movements just because
it's the end of the week i did a lot of
pulling movements already
a little fatigue so this is a inherently
lighter variant and i'm going to shoot
for about 10 to 20 reps i'm going to do
about four sets
i like this one a lot
especially if you have a hard time
getting a good mind muscle connection
with biceps this is a really good one to
explore so i'm gonna do with easy curl
bar nothing too fancy just doing some
straight sets of about 10 to 20 reps
[Music]
you know
sometimes
when you're as
big as i am
you get so much lactate that builds up
throughout your body
and
it just happens you just got to be ready
for it brother
make sure you get the right angle
yeah there you go
look into my soul
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
i want to get through this so i can
drink a whole lot of beer
or alcohol give me alcohol that's what
i'm ready for yeah
post-workout though probably not the
best
carbs
[Music]
uh
[Music]
almost done
oh i am white my god
you know a lot of people ask me dr james
how much juice are you on be honest
and i like to say or i like to identify
as being natty adjacent i think that's
the most fair most reasonable position
okay that's all i'm gonna say about that
[Music]
all right last one for today now you
might be looking at this going james why
on earth are you using the fart machine
that is a push movement
so i have a good blend of like type 1
and type 2a fibers
so what that means is although
effectively by training age i'm advanced
my recovery is more like an intermediate
so for me i can train chest three times
per week pretty comfortably normally my
heavy chest day would be on monday i
would have a kind of moderate chest day
midway through the week and then this is
my lightest chest day
at the end and then i'll have a rest day
off and then i'll have my heavy chest
day at the start of next week so for
this one i usually do a lighter chest so
on this particular mesocycle i'm going
to do something around 10 to 20 reps in
the third mesocycle so in the next one
this will become my lightest chest so i
might do something more in the like 20
to 30 rep range i might do something
like a metabolite protocol or something
along those lines so i treat this one as
my lightest chest day then i have a day
off and then i will train my heavier
push some people won't be able to do
that especially if you're more like mike
charlie jared where you're just really
big and really strong for those of you
who are like me i'm kind of a little bit
of 50 50 like type 1 type 2a not the
strongest person in the world and my
recovery is pretty quick so again i
consider myself my training age to be
advanced but in terms of like recovery
timelines i train more like an
intermediate so that's why i might train
a push
[Music]
so i like this machine i managed to not
laugh but i was noticing for myself and
you might have noticed my elbows kind of
going up and down i was playing around
with a different movement it seemed like
i was getting the best stretch and like
tension when i was pulling my elbows
back and up versus kind of tucking down
so that's just me i have you know wide
shoulders and long arms so i felt like
kind of flaring my elbows like this
felt more in the chest than tucked down
here now for a lot of you you might find
that your strength
is much higher with the elbows tucked
more like a power lifting style kind of
bench
you just have to play around with it and
see what feels good to you that's why we
have that idea of sfr so for me i'm not
so worried about how much weight i'm
moving around
versus am i training the muscle that i'm
trying to train which is my chest
excuse me chest
and uh to me that variation felt better
even if it felt a little weaker
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
folks i think we're approaching the end
hey i'm getting real tired and and testy
and b uh this actually is really hitting
uh kind of this like mid part of my
chest really good kind of feels like i
just did like a couple sets of flies you
know that feeling where it just feels
like it's stretched and kind of fucked
up so i'm just gonna call it a day on
three so i'm gonna do one more set of
these and that is it so i did a heavy
flat emphasis on my first two movements
i did a little bit of row a little bit
of biceps a little bit of push then
tomorrow i'm gonna take the day off and
rest so let's wrap this one up
[Music]
[Music]
that was a great workout so despite
having
shitty travel situation i got stuck in a
city had to get on an early flight this
morning made it out here
despite all that
had a really good training session
i hope that's just a friendly reminder
to some of you guys too that like
sometimes shit goes south and you just
kind of have to make the best of it so
despite having a shitty conditions not
having my usual setup i feel like i got
a pretty great work i mean how can you
not get a great workout at this place my
god but it doesn't take a whole lot just
got to put in some effort and you can
get it done thanks for hanging out with
me while i lift it today and we'll see
you on some q a's in the future
[Music]
