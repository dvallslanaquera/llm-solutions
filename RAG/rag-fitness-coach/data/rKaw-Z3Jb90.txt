hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
spiritization
chops still in full effect getting my
animan team installed in a couple days
they say it's a risky procedure but to
quote grandma's boy it'll be worth it
if you don't know that quote or watch
grandma's boy it's a great movie
hypertrophy concepts and tools number 28
troubleshooting lack of progress
very interesting lecture if you watch
hypertrophy concepts and tools number 27
which you should have
we talked about how to measure and track
progress so we know if we're getting it
using that previous presentation go back
and watch it if you haven't seen it
you will be keen on when progress is one
of the following three possibilities
first progress is clearly evident and at
a rate you find
understandable like that makes sense
okay cool
progress is evident but it is at a rate
you find
or the uss is a sub expectation yes you
did make progress but
man given everything you're doing you
really were expecting more realistically
expecting more
or number three progress is just not
evident
it's not clear you've put on any muscle
through any of the ways we
measured or proxy that gain in the last
lecture
so if you find yourself in the first
category
for progress is clearly evident or rate
you find understandable
you're doing great and you can always do
better so you can always sharpen up on
stuff
but that's all what all these
hypertrophy concepts and tools
presentations are for it's the super
detail
but if you find yourself in the latter
two categories okay your progress is
evident but
you really were expecting more
realistically or your progress is not
even at all
there are at least nine formal steps
check boxes
you can take to make sure you're not
missing any important factors
that supply the potential for growth
indicate the potential for growth
or support that potential for growth
let's get through all nine of them
luckily they appear on one page
this is a good thing to be uh taking a
picture of
and putting on instagram
nine troubleshooting factors that you
can take
right to your program if you're not
getting the results that you were
expecting and
make sure you're checking them all off
here we go
number one and they're not in any real
specific order they're all very
important
the first one is the most important but
then they order kind of uh
some are very important some not so much
they're all important but some more than
others in a non-linear way
number one appropriate and consistent
training
whatever you think appropriate is
consistently
and diet consistently because
it doesn't matter how awesome your
training is or how great your diet is
if you're inconsistent with either one
of them you cannot reasonably be
expecting
any kind of detectable progress unless
you think it comes
from magic or thin air right it's like
designing a bridge on paper that has
awesome structural elements
and then when you're actually going to
build a bridge you sort of do a good job
sometimes sometimes
you cut some corners and sometimes you
don't do any work on the bridge at all
so when the contractor or when you're
the contractor when the the person who
gave you the contract is asking hey
how's my bridge going
and they come to see that the bridge is
halfway built and part of it's collapsed
they're going to be like oh my god like
what happened to your plan well nothing
happened to your plan your plan is great
you just have been executing your plan
so this happens a lot even number one
seems almost pedantic right like we'll
do a good job
duh well kind of duh because a lot of
people will miss workouts
they'll miss meals or they'll overeat on
a fat loss plate fan or a fat loss phase
or something like that
and then at the end of the day they're
like man you know i think i got to try
drop sets again that's what i'm really
missing no
it's not what you're missing do your
diligence
first then after that if you still
haven't made the progress you want
then you can get into the details
without consistency
none of any of this matters now that
we've taken care of that we're going to
assume
you're being consistent you can apply
point number two
making sure your training volume is
between minimum effective volume and
maximum recoverable volume for each
muscle group trained
if you don't know what those mean you
have no way of guaranteeing progress if
you don't know how to measure them you
have no way of guaranteeing progress
good news is both of those are explained
very well and measuring them is
explained very well
in the other hypertrophy concepts and
tools lectures that come before this
but you have to know is your training
volume at least somewhere in that range
from minimum effective
to maximum recoverable period and that's
huge
people say man you know i've hit a
plateau with my chest should i train it
more or less
next question for them well what's your
maximum recovery volume for your chest
given that you train it twice a week
they'd be like i don't know like
how can you possibly know if more or
less is a good idea you could already be
beyond your mrv and for sure the answer
is trained less or you could be barely
at your mev and for sure the answer is
train more or you could be smack dab
between the two and now it's not a more
or less question
it's a question of quality or question
of maybe your chest isn't growing much
for genetic factors or nutritional
factors whatever
so you training has to be pretending to
be an mrv for you
especially for a muscle group like why
are my biceps not growing why my
forearms not working
for you to answer questions like that
you have to have that basic block in
their period
fix that first number three
fatigue management is fundamentally in
line i would also say this is third most
important
okay fatigue management is fundamentally
in line that means
sleep is good stress management is good
your physical and emotional fatigue are
in check they're not crazy high
okay because if you've been doing a
really good job in the gym and you've
been doing a really good job training
volume but you're going through the
worst
break up with your girlfriend anyone's
ever been through and she's stabbed you
with an
empty beer bottle i really don't know if
that much emotional stress and sleepless
nights
is going to be surprising to limit your
muscle growth right so make sure that
stuff is handled
and then okay that's one more box we
checked and
a lot of these things is this isn't so
much okay i've checked all the boxes
damn it i still have a mystery
as you check each box you're going to
realize i'm not actually doing this a
hundred percent
you're gonna do it a hundred percent or
close then once you check the box you're
gonna be like
wait a minute i can actually stop doing
this list because now i'm growing muscle
again like crazy
right so as you check all these boxes
you're increasing your chances for
actually growing muscle
right number four making sure the
exercises you're choosing
consistently have high stimulus to
fatigue ratios especially high raw
stimulus magnitudes they're
actually causing muscle growth
to be stimulated versus like oh i'm
training
right because a lot of people won't
train hard enough they won't train with
the right exercises
so i'm gonna say man like i'm really
having trouble adding size to my lats
they say okay look what exercises you do
like i do this row and that row and this
one one arm pull down
and you can say okay do you feel tension
in your lats when you're training like
no burn at higher ups in your lats
no what about a pump do you get a back
pump no disruption like can you feel
your lats like messed up like nah
honestly
i can't even tell they're back there
what the hell are you expecting them to
grow for
and there's no correlate of you actually
stimulating muscle growth at all so make
sure you
are implementing your program with
technique with exercise selection so on
and so on
in such a way as to actually get good
workouts by higher stimulus magnitudes
and high stimulus to fatigue ratios
period then you know all that fatigue
management and
mrv and appropriate consistency is being
put into the right place
number five is really an extension of
number six it's making sure
that you're using the right repetition
ranges and for targeting the right
muscles and the right
exercises to have high stimulus to
fatigue ratios because people can say
man i'm training hard
um doing everything right you say okay
you're quad training your quads haven't
been growing how like no not nearly as
much as i want okay
how are you appropriately training your
quads yep squats and all that stuff
great diet's good
volume is good fatigue management's fine
stimulus to fatigue ratios are pretty
decent
right like someone can say like well you
know like uh
for me squats work a bit better than leg
presses so i've been doing more squats
and i've got the technique that hits my
quads the most like okay sweet
what rep range you're using like man
that's a five to ten like fucking heavy
weight to grow right you're like
try sets of 10 to 20. they try them and
after two sets they can't
walk and they throw out blood and
they're like oh my god my quads are sore
for a week and a half how the hell does
this happen like well
sometimes the legs and sometimes other
muscles really benefit from higher reps
and just they grow much better and they
go holy shit i didn't have no idea right
so even if you're training hard and
doing sort of all the right things
in the context of a certain repetition
range make sure you're exploring other
ranges and
biasing most of your training to where
you have the highest sfrs the highest
disruptions to the muscle the must pump
so on and so on and so on because a lot
of people will train muscles in ways
they think they should be trained
and for years not see very great gains a
lot of it's because you're chasing
weight
we've all come from a perspective most
of us anyway of just getting stronger
and we're like we're meatheads right so
or
meat meat guys and meet gals we want to
lift heavy so that five to ten rep range
a lot of times is really like seductive
when we just do it a lot
and we're like man my triceps haven't
been growing i've been doing
everything's super heavy and all of a
sudden you just drop the eagle one day
you do a lot of push downs and
and dips for high reps and your triceps
get blown out and then weeks and weeks
and weeks later it's not just a one-time
thing
you just get these great responses and
you end up adding slabs of meat to your
triceps you're like what the hell was i
doing for years going too heavy
why am i so passionate about this i've
done that for years
i came from a power lifting background
so i was trying to skyrocket i was
driving my deadlift as high as possible
drive bent row since that's a five to
ten and what i realized was
for me bent rows in sets of ten to
twenty caused way more growth than since
a five to ten it's good that i realized
that
fixed it and then got great gains
because a lot of people will struggle
and fundamentally be training well
but ignore the right rep ranges for the
right muscles or the right mix of rep
ranges
that can happen in the other direction
too people do a bunch of pump squeeze
shit
for their pecs and it turns out when
they just do sets of five to ten
hardcore
then their pecs grow a ton they'll be
like damn it i didn't want to have to
lift heavy well guess what bad news for
you
right number six huge one
you should be in hypercaloric phases
when you're trying to gain muscle
i know it's really crazy and adding body
weight
net body weight over the last months or
years
how can i put this without making it
sound crazy people will say
hey look i want to be jacked i haven't
put on a lot of muscle in the past
several years
my next question to them is usually this
how much did you weigh several years ago
i said yeah like 150.
how much do you weigh now they're like
150. i'm like so you're a lot uh
you're a lot fatter now then like no no
like i'm pretty lean and i was pretty
lean back then
cool have you tried going heavier than
150 like gaining weight
and they're like uh yeah i tried getting
like 155 but i looked
a little bit softer and like that okay
sweet
how in god's name you're supposed to put
on muscle if you're already lean and you
weigh the same fucking thing
show me in a physics book how matter and
energy conservation
allows that to happen where the hell is
the muscle coming from can you imagine
seeing someone at 150 pounds and years
later there's
still 150 relatively the same leanness
but they just look way more jacked
what what that jackie chan meme uh
how does it even work if you weigh 150
and you want to be more jacked
years later you had better weight 160
years later better way 170 and so on and
so on and so on
right that's why mr olympia weighs 200
and some odd pounds
because there's no way to be jacked
without gaining weight
i know it sounds crazy but people do
this all the time with they'll
be super attentive to detail have great
training great everything
but they're not willfully extending
their body weight reach
new heights and a lot of times that
means for months on end during the end
of muscle gain phases becoming
uncomfortable
getting a little fatter than maybe you
had wanted not super super fat
but a little bit fatter stuffing
yourself you don't want to eat 500 grams
of carbs but today's a 500 gram of carb
day you will do it
because you're not done you're done
weighing 168 you want to weigh 174.
only 174 is going to happen is
discomfort all the way from 168 which
was your previous heavy weight
last year to 174 which is going to be
your new heaviest weight this year it's
all
pain also 69 70 so on and so forth is
awful
you feel like throwing up all the time
it's part of the process
if you've made multiple attempts to gain
weight
successfully gain weight but all of it
has been fat
okay these other ones are real important
now and maybe the ones i'll talk about
right after
are very important and there may be
nothing to do about that maybe you're a
genetic ceiling
if you haven't even tried to gain
meaningful amounts of weight buy
in context methodically stuffing
yourself a little bit here and there
pushing your weight on purpose up and up
then you haven't really tried and it
might be that you're missing most of
your muscle gains
because here's a really really crazy
fact the one thing
that may be keeping you from gaining
muscle is just your appetite
period your muscles may be bleeding
starving for growth
but you're seven percent fat at 150
pounds and there's no way
unless you gain weight you're going to
be gaining muscle at seven percent fat
doesn't matter how anabolic you are
what's that supposed to happen
you're gonna gain from muscle from seven
percent fat without gaining any weight
that means your fat goes from seven to
six to five to four to three
while you're in maintenance get out of
here right unless you have the best
genetics of all time and you're a total
beginner
that's never gonna happen so if you're
seven percent body fat at 150 pounds
you're going to have to add add actual
weight
period and if you haven't done that
that's arguably one of the biggest
things in here
number seven on the training side
doing good fatigue management if someone
tells me that i
haven't been making progress one of my
little sort of canaries in the coal mine
kind of questions is
how are your d-loads how often do you
take them there's the worst thing you
could tell me as an answer to that is
i'd go what's a d-load like holy shit do
you ever take a week off of training or
take a week of lighter training like
yeah
once every like year or six months when
i get hurt bad answer
okay if every several months at least
you're not taking a deload
or at least a week off of training
you're doing it wrong
for sure okay active rests do you
sometimes get away from the gym
for two weeks on end let the
psychological fatigue cool down
let the connective tissue stuff cool
down if the answer to that is no it's
not as big of a deal as long as you're
taking deloads but if you're
sufficiently advanced
active rest is a really good idea a lot
of times pro coaches
when they inherit a client that's an
ifbb pro
they will ask them questions like this
and it turns out the guy hasn't taken a
break
from running hardcore special sports
supplements or training like a wild
animal for like three years
and they're like well so what we did
with frank when we first started
was i just told him because i was
already a famous pro coach but this
isn't me talking
reciting someone i said list if you
believe what i'm doing here if you want
to go to mr olympia like all my other
clients
you're going to take three weeks off of
training and all of your supplements
right now and a lot of times people are
like what
i hired you to make me better it's like
you are a walking mess
of halfway injuries and crazy amounts of
fatigue
and your health's not that great let's
cool you off
they take that literally this stuff is
on instagram people talk about like oh
man my coach made me do this
a month later they look flatter they
look worse
but they're feeling like pretty
rejuvenated because they have not taken
a break in years
and all of a sudden after another month
they start to weave back in all their
training all supplements
and then boom and then boom and then
boom then all of a sudden the mr olympia
they're up five pounds
down body fat best ever they take fifth
place holy crap how did it happen well
they took their active rest for the
first time in forever they just had no
idea that was a thing
right how many people really tell you
you got to drive hard train harder and
do all this stuff and you'll be a
champion everyone
how many people say like yeah every year
you should take like two weeks or a
month
off or very light training completely
what the hell i've never heard that shit
that's very very rare
but sometimes that's what has to be done
and if you've never done that that could
be holding you back
and of course low volume phases if
you're always cranking super high volume
maybe some low volume would really help
some very well-known coaches do that
with their athletes and they have very
very good results for reasons obvious to
you if you've been paying attention
through all these other hypertrophy
advanced lectures we've been doing
number eight huge one
huge one is all of these changes
changes one through seven making them
for enough
time to see a difference if you've been
doing all the stuff right and you've
been doing it for a week
and you're like man i haven't gained any
muscle what the hell is wrong with you
you can't even measure muscle gains
over a week there's no instrument
precise enough to do that
so you got to do it for months not weeks
or days
if you can look back and say i've been
appropriately training and dieting for
months
i've been within line for my volume
landmarks i've been fatigue management
etc etc i've done all these things all
the one through seven stuff
super well for months and then you
haven't gained any muscle
you got a hell of a puzzle on your hands
but if you do them all for months most
people will gain really really decent
amount of muscle and be like oh holy
shit
well there you go right so stick to it
it's not just consistency it's duration
you can be consistent over a week but
weeks and weeks and weeks of consistency
is really what it takes to figure out am
i doing the right thing
is it really working right it's like
trying to take a
a class in french to speak french you do
like three lessons you don't really
speak any better french
people are like hey you're still taking
that french class you're like nah fuck
that i didn't learn anything
so so i stopped like wow man that sucks
how many classes you do you're like
three
like oh so you know like amore and like
whatever the fuck the word for dog is
like yeah well that's not enough like
well don't you need to be in french
class for like 12 weeks to get some
basic conversations going like uh
i guess yeah i guess why the hell did
you quit for three weeks folks
sounds like appreciate the choir people
do shit all the time your clients do it
all the time they try something for a
week
it didn't work right you got to give a
due diligence at least a mesocycle
probably a block of training three or
four messes in a row
then you can say okay did i really do my
best did i gain muscle how much did i
gain so on and so forth
lastly this isn't really a check mark
it's more of a real talk kind of point
to see if you're being sane
point number nine is having realistic
expectations
for what good gains are in your current
situation
actually told the story in the last
lecture but i'll retell it a little bit
differently
um i've had at least one person that i
can remember very clearly but
dozens of others over the years hit me
up and say look i'm not getting really
really good gains
okay i'm not gaining they'll even say
one particular individual said look i
i can't can't gain weight and i said
because i was wise to the shit by then i
was like i can't gain weight okay
how much weight have you gained over the
last several months and he was like well
like he told me a number it was
basically like half a pound a week
and i was like you gained half a pound a
week over the last like 12 weeks he's
like
yeah i'm like that's really good he's
like
is it and i'm like yes that's almost
ideal and he's like
i wanted to gain a pound a week though
and to him
literally if it wasn't a pound a week of
tissue gained
on the scale it was failure he just
thought he wasn't gaining any weight
so he literally came to me and said i
can't gain weight even though i've been
eating all these calories
and so forth i look like if i was green
to the shit if i had no idea what i was
doing it was my first rodeo and even if
i had all the science knowledge but no
practical experience working with
clients
i'd be like oh my god like holy crap
like let me look at a keras
around the carb numbers you you should
be gaining weight
oh i wonder like are you taking
stimulants or maybe your sleep's not
good maybe you're
you know not exercising timmy
thermogenesis is crazy or like a
recreational cyclist in your spare time
like no i guess not
you know hold on a second let's not
assume that this is all as correct as it
is
let's ask the person to hold on to what
actually has been happening
people do the same with strength man i
can't get my bench press to go up
okay how much did your bench press go up
over the last year they're like 25
pounds
like what the hell that sounds like
gains to me and they're like yeah but
last year went up by 50.
well gains have an asymptotic nature to
them it's curvilinear as you get better
you still gain but it's slower and
slower and slower rates so that just
makes sense
i think a lot of people think they have
a plateau they're just in that
curvilinear phase
or even compared to other people in the
same training age they're getting really
good gains other people
aren't they just have a wrong reference
point sometimes their reference points
gains they used to get look when you
start 120 pounds
all the way up to 140 you can gain a
pound a week no problem because that's
easy when you get to 140
a pound a week may be tough and now
you're getting half a pound you're
thinking oh man i'm treading water
you're not you're actually gaining
people do that stuff with strength they
do with everything and sometimes
the reference point they have isn't even
something they used to do it's something
i see in a magazine like well this
bodybuilder gained a pound a week i
should be doing that too and anything
else is failure
bs so make sure you at least have a
realistic understanding of how much
you can be gaining um a bunch of people
i think uh eric helms alan aragon meadow
henselman's
they have written in depth about what
especially naturals
can expect on average just on average
right
to gain year to year to year over the
training over the first like five to ten
years of training right
these are not gold standard like for
sure the truth
but like if you're gaining five pounds
of muscle a year
and their numbers say you should be
expecting two to three and you're
complaining that you're not getting any
gains you're just wrong
if their numbers say you should be
gaining five to ten pounds of muscle a
year after the first let's say two years
and you're gaining zero okay okay
you gotta get through and get through
these factors because
realistically you are underperforming
know
those reference values know especially
what you used to do
and if you can even just do the same as
what you used to do or a little bit
worse
you're already winning but if you expect
like when you were beginning your games
to be like this and now that you read a
bunch of science books and no
periodization for them to be like that
that's not gonna happen the best result
is that they just do this again
that's incredible can you imagine just
doubling your beginner gains
fuck yeah that's awesome more
realistically and still awesome
is they start to do this right like that
what you don't want is this
okay you don't want at no gains or worse
right
you really don't want like this kind of
sucks just a little bit of increase
but this is great you're still going up
at a pretty decent rate but not as fast
right so keep that in mind to make sure
you're not second guessing yourself and
doing a lot of paralysis
uh by analysis i mean like shit shit oh
i got to do all these nine
troubleshooting factors i'm not getting
any muscle where as you look back in
last year and you've gained 10
pounds and compared to other people of
your training age and gender and so on
and so forth
you're ahead of the curve what the hell
are you doing just keep doing a good job
and when you actually have trouble
gaining according to the reference
standards
then you can really apply these don't
have to waste your time overthinking
things if there's no reason to do so
right so big implications before we cut
this off
there's no such thing as satisfactory
gains notice
i never used it once in this entire
lecture the term
satisfactory gains people hit me up on
instagram they're like
i haven't been getting the gains i've
wanted guess what i don't weigh 9 000
fucking pounds
which by definition means i haven't been
getting the gains i wanted because i
wanted to look like hulk
from that first movie with ang lee well
that motherfucker's the size of a tank
he's like 12 feet tall i don't look like
that so my gains are not satisfactory to
me
okay there's no such thing because
faster would always be better
can you imagine if you were gaining
muscle like a pound a week crazy right
but then there was this pill which had
no side effects and no health maladies
aliens gave you and they're like you can
gain
half a pound of muscle a week faster if
you take this pill would you be like ah
no thanks aliens of course not you'd be
like fuck yeah you got two of those
pills that i could take
right no such thing as satisfactory
gains right
but there's realistic gains and there's
a bit shy of realistic
right and if you're a bit shy of that
realistic gains
which is an honest calculation you have
to make yourself with the help of some
of those resources i talked about
earlier
then it could be due to the nine factors
that you can troubleshoot and then you
get back to really good gains
expected gains realistic gains rather or
it could be due to genetics
right you may just not be able to gain
much faster because of your genetics
or you're reaching your genetic ceiling
and you've done most of the gaining you
ever will
right so once you've given the nine
factors due diligence
there's no guarantee that your progress
will speed up because it could be
genetic stuff
or there's no guarantee it'll speed up
uh at all
it could just be the same or could still
be worse because time is
going on and your training response is
getting worse and worse and worse right
or relatively speaking yielding you
fractional
smaller and smaller gains but huge but
at least you'll be reasonably sure
that you're getting the gains your genes
are limiting you to
what you don't want is to be stuck in
that situation where you're like well i
guess i've hit my genetic ceiling and
you never even learned what mev and mrv
were
and then years later you're just
pottering along you learn about the
volume landmarks and you gain 10 pounds
of muscle in two years and you're like
what the hell how come i didn't know
about this earlier
so with nine factors apply them to your
training make sure you're doing a really
good job and a lot of you folks will be
able to check mark everything you hear
already and be like i already do all
that stuff and if you do great then
you're getting the gains
you literally deserve in the sense that
you've worked for
if you haven't applied those nine
factors you should before you conclude
anything about your genetic limits or
where you're going
or what you know the future holds the
store for you how much muscle you have
to gain
all you can do is your best your best
not someone else's best
your best so do your best with applying
these nine factors see what kind of
gains you get
and enjoy those for what they are folks
thank you so much see you next time
you
