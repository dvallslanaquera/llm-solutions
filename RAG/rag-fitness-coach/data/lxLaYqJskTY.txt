hey folks dr mike here with a super
quick weekly tip how
do you detect that you're having a good
mind muscle connection and how do you
perfect your mind muscle connection
first of all what the hell is a mind
muscle connection before that we have to
answer a very related question of what
the raw stimulus magnitude is
it is
a proxy an estimate an idea a
hypothetical
about how much muscle growth stimulus a
given unit of training is likely to be
causing when you say like oh man that
leg press really fucked up my quads like
you're essentially saying in much less
scientific language that man that raw
stimulus magnitude of that leg press
machine of that number of sets i did is
very high notice that the raw stimulus
magnitude is not the same thing as the
stimulus to fatigue ratio the stimulus
to fatigue ratio is the raw stimulus
magnitude on top in the numerator but in
the denominator it's how much fatigue so
we're saying man that leg press fucked
me up we're saying in a good way for
sure high raw stimulus magnitude we're
not saying anything about how fatiguing
it was if your knees are great you feel
fine then it was low fatigue your knees
are fucked up hips are fucked up and you
feel like shit maybe it was high fatigue
here we're just talking about the raw
stimulus magnitude and the raw stimulus
magnitude is proxied by three other
things the mind muscle connection
how much of a mind muscle connection you
get from that exercise let's say
the pump how much of a pump you get and
the degree of disruption don't worry
future videos will cover the pump and
the disruption for now we're just going
to talk about mind muscle connection so
remember the more of a mind muscle
connection you can get an exercise the
better the more raw stimulus magnitude
you have and thus the more growth all
things being equal you are likely to
cause so basically the more mind muscle
connection mmc for short mcmc
i used to be a dj many people don't know
this that was before
my french chef thing you guys know about
that so in any case more mind muscle
connection you can have other things
being equal the more muscle growth so
how the fuck well first of all what is
it and how do we get a lot of
at rp and in our hypertrophy book we
define the mind muscle connection as the
amount of tension and or burn that you
get in your target muscle
for that exercise
at lower reps generally you tend to feel
tension so for example if you're doing
let's say
incline barbell press for your chest
sets of like five to ten you feel your
pecs
like the tension super expanding in the
way down crunching really hard at the
top if someone came up to you and
they're like hey man you feel a lot of
tension your pecs doing that exercise
and you're like no they'd be like so you
think you're doing it right because i
think it's a chest exercise and if your
muscles the chest
aren't producing seemingly a lot of
tension what the hell is going on right
you're like if i feel it a ton of my
front delts a ton of touch in my triceps
not a lot of my chest
maybe it's the wrong exercise maybe it's
the wrong rep range maybe the technique
is off something has to change however
if you are doing incline barbell press
in sets of five to ten to hit your chest
and you feel a crap load of tension in
your pecs
99 problems you may have
supplying a good stimulus to the chest
probably isn't one of that's a very very
good sign on the other hand what about
at higher reps because you could say
okay what about machine chest presses
sets of like 20. you know yeah tension
you feel but it's high reps
how do you know if you're really hitting
your chest well this part of the mind
muscle connection is the burn
if you get a gnarly gnarly burn in your
pecs and not a ton of your triceps and
out of town your front delts you know
with a pretty decent certainty at least
the beginning of it that yeah man the
chest is doing something because how is
the chest going to create all these
metabolites if it's not contracting and
if it's contracting that means muscle
stimulus is occurring so it's some
combination of pump and burn now
if you're doing middle of the road rep
ranges let's say leg presses for sets of
15 do you feel tension in your quads yes
do you feel a burn also yes so ideally
you sort of have a combination of these
but either one of them by themselves is
a really really good thing that's how
you detect the mind muscle connection so
if someone asks you when you're doing
lunges hey do you feel that in your
glutes deal that in your glutes if you
don't feel tension in your glutes during
the repetitions if you don't feel a burn
towards the end
you feel a ton of tension in your quads
though and a ton of burning your quads
when someone's like hey man hit your
glutes you could say
and they're like yeah i see lunge is
great good job and they walk off but
then you're like sitting on a bench like
am i lying to myself and others because
clearly my quads are feeling some shit
what about my glutes there are other
ways of seeing if you hit your glutes
we'll talk about those in videos next
week
however
you would hope some tension is felt or
some burners felt in the target muscle
it's a very good sign
that's the mind muscle connection
easy said
maybe not so easy done so how do we
perfect our mind muscle connection
because a lot of people struggle with
this there are three goals to accomplish
in really perfecting your mind muscle
connection these three goals can happen
years apart from each other here's goal
number one
[Music]
hey do you want to like go on a date
with me
okay
hey
we're going on a date cool
yeah
[Music]
first
be well practiced in how to detect
target muscle tension and or burn you
can't perfect a mind muscle connection
if you can't even tell what the tension
is first of all you have to know what
muscles you're training you can't tell a
beginner
like who doesn't know what a gluteus
maximus is or who doesn't know what the
you know oh i don't know long head of
the triceps is like hey do you feel down
your long head they're like uh-huh and
you're like do you know what that is
like
point to the long head of your triceps
they're like
they're like no so first of all you have
to know some anatomy and you have to
know what tension feels like and what
the burn feels like because remember if
you're a personal trainer a lot of you
guys watching this are
a lot of clients when they're beginners
can't even tell between like an injury
kind of pain and a burn kind of pain
i've had clients be like oh my god oh my
god they have to stop squatting i'm like
are you okay like oh my legs hurt i'm
like okay like where and they're like
you're just here and they kind of rub
their quads i'm like uh-huh is it like a
really sharp kind of pain like no it's
getting better now but ooh it's like a
burn i'm like that's a good thing and
they're like oh and they're like oh
this is going to be like this every day
i'm like ah what the fuck did i sign up
for right so first of all you have to
kind of know what tension and burn are
here is
however after that here's the big thing
there are two foundations
for how to detect the tension in the
burn
one
is to have good technique
if
your goal is to detect the tension and
burn you have to input the actual effort
to get the tension in the burn to the
target muscles if your technique in the
bench press isn't like like this
shoulders forward and caved in and shit
and someone's like hey you getting
attention and your pecs are like i don't
think so you're not fucking using your
pecs barely using a ton of front delts
and triceps that if you are tracked
properly and go super deep i would but
i'd fall back out of the chair
then with good technique you're like oh
i feel it in the right place so the
absolute critical core foundation of
feeling the tension and burn in the
target muscle is to have good technique
to begin with a lot of times people will
leg press or squat or do pull-ups and
every 50 trillion other exercises a
little bit wrong or a lot wrong and they
actually can't generate the tension
can't generate the burn in the target
muscles
absolutely if someone has bad technique
and this is something i get super often
like hey i'm trying to work on my
my mind muscle connection and i'm like
okay well show me a video of you
training and they show me a video i'm
like i don't even fucking know what
muscle group what the fuck is that are
you having some kind of like episode or
is that an exercise
that's a deadlift i'm like no that's you
giving birth in reverse
you got to fix some shit right once your
technique is good you can actually do a
decent job of targeting the muscles
secondly
a high degree of tension can be detected
if you're far from fail
with heavier weights but if they're
really heavy you're automatically close
to fail the burn doesn't actually start
to occur until you're close to failure
so if you let's say have a client and
they are doing lunges for their glutes
and let's say they are a beginner and
they do some steps and they're like oh
okay i think that's it the set is over
like oh gotcha it was pretty good set
did you get a burn in your glutes like i
don't think so no like okay
how many more lunges do you think you
could have done they're like oh
oh i don't know maybe two more and
you're like i try doing some more and
they do like 50 more lunges and they
look at you like oh yeah i can feel it
like come on you're nowhere close to
failure
if you get close to failure then you
feel the burn so a lot of times when
people ask the question of like well you
said we're supposed to feel the burn in
this exercise but i don't okay
how's your technique oh it looks good
fine check foundation one foundation two
are you pushing close to fail if you
push close to fail on a bench press with
your pecs you will feel some fucking
tension and in a machine high rep press
if you say i don't feel the burn in my
pecs go close to failure go all the way
to failure rep number 23 they're like ah
fuck you guys ever get out of a machine
you're like
how do you feel like you're on fire like
get a fucking firehose put me out this
shit is crazy so
if you have good technique
and you can push close to fail
then you're ready to really start to
process what a my muscle connection is
and my big tip to you guys if you're a
beginner first two three years of
training or if you're working with
beginner clients i wouldn't even i
wouldn't even worry about the mind
muscle connection this is an advanced
thing
goal number two
once
you have good technique
and you have the ability to push close
to fail
your next goal
should be to optimize your technique and
level of effort
to take a good tension
burn in exercises that you normally do
and make it great
this takes years
you can play around with foot
positioning in the leg press and the
squat and the stiff legged deadlift you
can play around with hand positioning
you can play around with depth you can
play around with elbow angle 50 trillion
different other things
you're going to find it because your
body's different than everybody else's
you're special just like everybody else
you're going to have slightly different
hand and foot positions and techniques
that lead to you feeling it more and the
thing is i never really if someone has
the basic techniques down i never judge
them on the specifics like i do skull
crushers like this charlie doesn't like
this jarrod doesn't like that and all of
us do slightly different but the core is
we figured out a technique that really
puts the tension on our triceps and gets
a crazy burn on our triceps because
we're all built a little differently
that might look different it takes years
to figure out how to take any given
exercise
that from goal number one you already
have good technique on and you know how
to push close to fail and you can detect
some attention and burn on the target
muscles and make it an unbelievable
tension and burn by optimizing that
exercise for yourself and that's not
yes people can give you general ideas
about hey try to push your knees more
forward on the squat try to xyz but a
lot of it is just for you to figure out
and explore
goal number three
be able to show up
to a new exercise or a new machine
and during the warm-up sets and
even during the work sets
raise your mind muscle connection that
is be able to impose and detect a ton of
tension and burn
by altering your technique and effort as
needed during that time
that makes you the fucking jedi master
of the mind muscle connection
if i go to a new gym and there's a leg
press machine i'm like holy shit that's
trippy i've never seen that machine
during the warm-up sets i'll play with
my foot position i'll play with my depth
i'll play with the setup or how i angle
the plate or how i angle the chair if i
have to put something under my back that
by the time i'm doing the work sets or
by the time i'm getting to the end of
the work sets i have taken the degree of
tension and burn imposed on my quads and
elevated significantly i've taken an
exercise that if i just mindlessly did
generally good technique on just go
through the full range of motion it
would have been okay i would have grown
some muscle i've taken that and made it
into a great exercise if you can do that
with a mind muscle connection holy crap
you're going to be unstoppable
eventually you get into temple during
the revolution and the younglings are
like hey you here to help us out you're
like
nah younglings you ain't gonna like this
part
see you guys next time
you
