hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
and today i dressed up as a traffic cone
anyway what does having good genetics
actually mean now in strength and in
size this gets a lot of lip service
my genetics suck i think i have decent
genetics
that guy's got great genetics you notice
no one ever says about themselves that
they have good genetics that would
cancel out
their hard work ostensibly so let's dig
in and figure out what
actually having good genetics is
and then we'll talk about what some
implications of that are for your
training
and sort of how you deal with yourself
sociologically comparing yourself to
other lifters so on and so forth so
major components of good genetics for
muscle
size so what does it mean when you say
well i think that guy's got good
genetics for getting
huge i can think of at least at least
nine sort of sub components first and
these are not in order
of their relative importance it's just a
list
initial muscle cell size some people
just have bigger muscle cells than
others okay
like their muscle each muscle style each
muscle fiber is just bigger
if they even have the same number of
muscle cells as almost everyone else or
close to the average they're just going
to be bigger to start out with you guys
ever see like
little kids running on the beach like
that's a jack little kid what what the
hell what the hell's up with that little
kid
maybe has some of that going on right
that takes zero training you just that's
how you
sort of show up uh to the start of
practice and
this is usually greatly influenced by
fiber type faster twitch
muscle cells tend to be larger okay
so people who tend to be more explosive
who have a higher proportion of faster
fibers also tend to have fire in higher
initial fiber size
which sort of makes them jack to begin
with now
second is muscle cell number some people
actually
have more muscle fibers more muscle
cells than others
that's a big deal because then not only
are you more likely to be more jacked to
start with
but because your muscle cells all grow
individually when you get more jacked
with resistance training in food
you're likely to get that much bigger
than everyone else because you started
out with more muscle cells
to begin with now we all know
that each muscle cell can only get so
big until it reaches its peak
sort of myonuclear domain ceiling and
then it has to have satellite cells
donate their nuclei
in order to continue that growth process
to make them much
much bigger you don't turn ifb pro have
huge muscles
by just making each cell individually 33
bigger doesn't work like that you have
to donate nuclei
the extent to which your satellite cell
pool
how many sort of cell nuclei you have in
reserve for your muscles
and the ease with which they are
essentially assimilated
into your muscles actual functional unit
is genetically governed to a large
extent
and if you have lots of satellite cells
to begin with and they very easily
uh convert and fuse with the muscle the
functional muscle itself then you're
essentially very
growth responsive and you're gonna
notice that as you train
you just continue to grow muscle and
grow muscle and grow muscle at a very
very sort of unbroken rate
that still means your rate will be
asymptotic but instead of going like
that
it's going to go up and it's going to
keep going a little bit slower all the
time but nonetheless
very impressively allowing you to reach
really really great heights of
muscularity
number four this is one that's more
visually apparent so these other ones
you can't really tell
what's going underneath the hood this
one you can muscle belly shape
and potential okay so
muscle belly shape is a really big deal
because that's really genetically
determined
sometimes you have muscles that just
grow outward
okay instead of lengthwise they grow
sort of widthwise and they get
really really bubbly sometimes they
start out bubbling if you have that
bubble muscle look
you can not only add more muscle because
it doesn't get in the way
of other muscles or other movements so
for example if your biceps only grow
mostly lengthwise at some point you
can't add a whole lot of bicep mass
because it's going to
reduce your range of motion even if you
keep adding it's going to make every
exercise less effective
because your range of motion sucks but
sometimes you'll notice people with
incredibly large biceps
have a huge peak which actually doesn't
really impede
nearly as much the range of motion
biceps you can continue to have very
high quality full range of motion
training
and your biceps are enormous right can
you alter
where the muscle grows with training you
can but it's a small fraction
muscle genetics for belly shape
determine a huge fraction of that so if
you sort of have
flatter looking muscles uh man you know
you can't absolutely get much more
jacked
but you probably aren't gonna look like
mr olympia in that particular muscle
remember all muscles of the body are
different
if you have tons of bubbliness to your
muscles when they grow they're gonna get
really really big
and look even bigger than their volume
may suggest
now the potential for growth is a big
deal
because you could have really
excellently shaped muscle but tiny bones
you could be super short
and then all of a sudden you can't get
super jacked because well you're only 5
1 and you have these teeny tiny bones so
your bone size the thicker your bones
are usually the more muscle you can put
on
the longer your bones are the more
muscle you can put on so height is a
huge factor
and frame size part of the sort of
inexplicable when you just look at it
but if you think about it
it makes sense part of that section of
genetics
is what is your hip width and what is
your intra-acromial width what is the
width of your shoulders
some folks genetically just have
relatively narrow hips
and really wide shoulders so if they
also have some of these other things
going for them
they're going to have this unreal v
taper that's going to look
really comic book style whereas if you
have really wide hips and narrow
shoulders
you can get super jacked you just don't
quite have that pop to you
it doesn't look like your physique is as
muscular even if you're carrying the
same amount of muscle
right and truth be told if your
interacromial width is very large and
you have average genetics you're gonna
be able to put on more back muscle
because there's just
more room for it because there's such a
wide berth between your shoulders if you
have really narrow shoulders
you can get a really big back but it
starts to bulge out interferes with
range of motion
so on and so forth number five is auto
and peregrine factors for growth that's
basically
especially when stimulated with training
do your muscle cells
secrete various compounds that affect
that cell itself
or with paracrine nearby cells uh mgf
muscle growth factor is a really really
good example of that where with training
the cell can be stimulated the muscle
cell is stimulated secretes a bunch of
stuff mgf may be one of those things
and it affects the cell itself and
possibly even some cells around it
notice i didn't say hormones yet because
that's point number six
endocrine factors are hormonal factors
so for example
if you naturally produce a ton of
testosterone
that's really good for your genetics
however
a lot of more astute listeners will note
the following
the correlation between natural
testosterone production and
natural muscularity isn't super tight it
is there
but it's not like one to one like you
would expect why not one of the big
things
is point number seven your cells
not only should they be with really good
genetics
secreting or excreting uh autocrine and
perican factors
and endocrine factors as far as the
glands that are concerned with secreting
testosterone for example not only should
they be producing
those messenger molecules that cause
growth the muscle cells should be
sensitive to them
a huge deal in how big you end up
is how sensitive your muscle cells are
to
the interaction with testosterone if you
have a crapload of androgen receptors
and your free testosterone is really
high man your muscle cells are going to
be getting a wallop of signaling
all the time to grow grow grow however
even if you produce a lot of
testosterone you have tons of it in the
bloodstream
if your muscle cells aren't very
sensitive they have a low density of
androgen receptors or the subtypes of
android receptors don't interact very
much with testosterone as much as others
do then you're in this situation where
like you get blood work and your skin is
and the doctor was like dude yeah the
baseline test is like 900
you know whatever units like that's
really sweet and you're like man
all right where the hell is all that
 going you know because a lot of
folks
when they live for a while and they turn
out to not be as jacked as they thought
they go get the blood work done because
they're clearly i'm hypocritical i don't
produce enough tests and some of them
find out that they're on the high end of
the range
a lot of the times that's because
they're not really sensitive to
testosterone
at the cell level and that is
sensitivity for not just testosterone
but all the other autocomparicon and
endocrine factors that contribute to
muscle growth
growth hormone being one of them so on
and so forth
number eight okay so real quick
the seven i just covered are the most
straightforward ones okay if you have
these
man you're well on your way to getting
jacked but but
two big butts accidentally quoting
sir mix-a-lot i believe if my 90s or
late 80s trivia serves me well
so number eight huge facilitating factor
not a causal factor but a facilitating
factor
is injury proclivity the lower the
better
all right and a lot of times this has to
do with connective tissue integrity
do you have strong tendons and strong
fascia and aponeurosis and so on and so
forth the parts of your muscle that
connect to the tendon
and are they adaptable do they scale at
the same rate
maybe even higher rate as your
musculature
as you become bigger because a lot of
folks don't have very strong tendons to
begin with
and or their muscles grow a lot but
their tendons don't have the same rate
not nearly the same rate of adaptability
and their muscles
outscale the strength of their tendons
and they're very prone to injury
you guys all know a bunch of people that
sort of used to be more jacked
then they got to a certain level of jack
they just started getting hurt now of
course
you can manage injury risk incredibly
well with proper training design
not doing stupid things nutritionally
gaining a ton of weight really fast and
feeling super bloated and strong so on
and so forth
uh intelligent periodization strategies
active rests
proper technique and so on down the line
however
all of that swims in a big sea of
independent
risk factor for actual injury i'll put
it to you this way
if you have really good genetics for not
getting hurt you can get away with a lot
of dumb and train super
hard with reckless abandon you just get
big or as big as the rest of these
factors would allow
if on the other hand you have real sort
of kiddie pool genetics on that end
you may have all of the best genetics
for getting jacked but as soon as you
start benching through 15
boom part of your pet goes you start
squatting 405 boom part of your quad
goes and you just regularly hurt
you just tend to be more of a frail
individual can you work around that
and still get really jacked to a large
extent yes but it requires a high
measure of sport science knowledge
intelligence and patience you look at
the cross-section of the bodybuilding
population
man those things are relatively
short supply unfortunately
so a lot of folks that could have done
pretty well maybe very well with really
shitty injury genetics just won't
because they train just like everyone
else and they get hurt
more than everyone else because they
have those shitty genetics but if you
have good genetics and energy resistance
you can in some cases just outlast
everyone like yeah that one guy had even
better genetics for a muscle game than
you
but he got hurt a bunch and you never
did you just kept growing and voila
there you are
most jack guy in the gym or something
like that lastly
in this actually may be the most
determinative factor that is if we take
a look at a cross-section of everyone
that ever starts lifting
who ends up the most jacked i would
wager
a decent sum of money that the biggest
if not
one of the biggest uh factors for who
ends up the
being the most jacked is the psychology
side
those that have it a proclivity for
training
people that actually like to train want
to train that is that something they sit
in a chair long enough they're like
i want to train you even enjoy the
process of training like whenever i've
done yoga i thought it was pretty cool
but there's no
i don't have this desire to go to yoga
all the time you need to be able to
enjoy training to some extent
have a drive for training to some extent
and have a really high work proclivity
or work ethic
and a huge fraction of all those things
you would say well that's all sociology
 like half or more of that is
genetically determined yes including
work ethic
so what that means is you can just be a
 total stud genetically
and go absolutely nowhere because
someone takes you to the gym and you're
like yeah man this is i guess this is
okay
this hurts my muscles i don't like this
let's get the out of here and do
some other
you i'm not just saying like you you
spent your
your potential at the gym and you're
just gonna go and be a derelict your
whole life
you absolutely could just go and like
start your own band and be a super
successful musician
start your own computer company and be
 bill gates who knows maybe bill
gates has incredible genetics but if
you're not drawn to the gym you don't
like the gym
you don't like that sort of like
rarefied air feeling of pushing it
further and further especially as the
weights get really heavy and the
workouts get really hard
if you're not down with that kind of
durian yate style mentality
man all these things are cool but you
just won't go very far because you'll
never maximize them
because to maximize them consistent hard
training is absolutely the key
so those are the major components of
good genetics for size
let's switch gears and talk about
strength now
number one in strength is every single
one of these factors for size except for
muscle belly shape but muscle belly
shape isn't super determined of how
strong you are we'll get into
architecture in just a little bit
slightly different topic
but basically nobody cares and strength
how your muscles look but they had
better have
an uh ability to become a large
especially for
absolute strength relative strength if
you're in a very low weight class
if you don't have the capacity
genetically to get very jacked that's
probably okay
because you're in a small weight class
especially if you have decent
musculature for your small bone size
you can be totally fine if you want the
most absolute strength possible
you're gonna have to have really good
genetics for muscle size uh i forget his
name is uh
instagram is irregular strength uh
julius something or other i think
um he's like the current world record
world record holder
that's a tough one for the bench press
and he's benched like basically 750 or
more
uh strict in competition raw like if you
look at his pecs you're like
what the we could fit like two
people in there okay
does he have all these other factors
probably in pretty decent
proportion that i'm going to talk about
for strength of course he does
certainly many of them but man there's
no way to bench 750 unless you have
genetics to have
 gigantic muscles specifically
packs shoulders and triceps and he's
enormous right so it makes
sense that size being the quintessential
underlying element of strength but you
can't have
dog size genetics and become like
the strongest you could have become
right so size is still the most
important next
is neural output ability different
people their nervous systems can recruit
a higher fraction of their muscles
than others even during sort of a
maximal effort
and if you have a nervous system that
can better recruit all of your muscles
then you have more potential for the
same muscle size to get more force
production out of it that's absolutely
thing
and it does have genetic correlates next
and this is really
kind of bittersweet athletic
coordination even in lifts like the
squat
definitely in deadlock for sure clean
and jerk and all the other movements
and definitely overhead press your
ability to adjust
force production into the proper vectors
at very quick rates
if you're falling forward in the squat
just a couple of milliseconds later if
you tilt your hips forward and come up
i mean that ability to make on the spot
changes to
actually get the lift to propel mostly
in the right arc
that's athleticism that's basically
almost the definition of athleticism is
adjustment or creation of high speed uh
movements in order to get
the body going where it's supposed to be
going that still matters for
strength
if you're wildly unathletic you're going
to lose more benches this way in that
way than the average lifter
you're going to lose more squats this
way that way your deadlift isn't going
to be properly aligned and it might
stall out on you
athleticism still plays a role not a
huge role
but a notable one it is absolutely
notable and
it especially notable when you're taking
maximum effort lift because here's the
thing
in a maximum effort lift a course
correction that takes you
one centimeter off of the line of of of
best pull or push
that lift is gone but there's no saving
that you spend way too much energy
trying to save it and or it's so heavy
that even a one centimeter deviation
means you just don't have enough maximal
pressing power for example
to do anything with it like you're not
you can't even save it even if you do
save it and bring it back in but then
you have not enough energy to lock out
if you're hyper athletic
you can stick to that initial path
better and course correct faster which
means you're probably going to finish
lifts and even if you're just as strong
underneath
as someone else that is less less
athletic
you're going to make a higher fraction
of your lifts and if we're talking about
the biggest lifts ever
you may make a bigger lift that someone
with the same basic underlying strength
but lack of athleticism
just has never made because ah man i
almost squatted 500 kilos at one time
and i fell just a little bit forward
where the athletic guy didn't fall
forward nailed the lift and
while there he is world record holder
next up
is muscle architecture the way your
muscle fibers point
determines to a pretty significant
extent how much force they actually
uh essentially pull on the tendon with
and how much the tendon actually pulls
on the bone and how much force is
produced to the bar and so on and so
forth
so some folks have muscle architecture
that's more designed to produce high
end limb velocities and some have muscle
architecture that's designed to produce
more high forces
and you know a lot of people because
fast twitch fibers are so good at both
of those things
we tend to not see a huge uh sort of
forking in the road for people that are
fast and people that are strong it's a
lot of the same people because they're
super fast which but there is a mini
forking there
you can have the muscle architecture
that really really is good
for force production and then you're
going to have this thing where
you're just a little bit stronger than
people would have predicted based on
your size and i'm sure you guys have run
into that in the gym we were like
 that guy mentioning 315. but like
he's like my size and i bench 225 that's
 right like well somehow you
know the muscle architecture is a bit
different
very related but even more powerful is
tendon insertion and origin points
the way that the biomechanics of this
works is that if your pecs insert at the
normal place
uh oh sorry originate at the normal
place sternal border and everything else
if they insert just a centimeter which
in practice almost never happens it's
huge but
in real terms the centimeters this much
not that much
if they insert just a centimeter lower
on the humerus the fraction
of torque that's increased is enormous
enormous it's like one and a half for
some crazy like that
we don't really see this kind of
variation in humans but we do see enough
variation where it absolutely has an
effect
on total output um there are a lot of
folks
who really don't look like they should
be benching what they're benching or
squatting what they're squatting it just
doesn't make any sense especially with
the bench press
there are some there's one particular
layer her name escapes me at the moment
i'm sure the youtube commentaries will
catch this
she's like a soccer mom and she she
weighs like 130 pounds and benches legit
315 to 335 in competition it's
mind-boggling and she's not that jacked
yeah she's got big packs and shoulders
but it's nothing crazy and she competes
drug-free and she's legit drug free and
you look at her and you're like
how how well perhaps one of the factors
she has
is her pecs insert just a little further
down the bone now interestingly enough
that reduces the end limb velocity
potential so super awesome athletes that
are the fastest
actually tend to have muscles that
insert very close to the joint just a
little bit closer than that is
but folks that have all those great
intrinsic muscular qualities size fiber
types so and so forth
if they insert a little bit further down
then they can produce
unreal forces that just look
inexplicable when you're like how the
 does that make any sense
that person doesn't look big enough to
be using those actual loads
point number six limb ratios okay
for power lifting i'll make it very
explicit ed cohen
the greatest power for all time comes
very very close
not by accident to the power lifting and
there's ideals for other strength sports
so the power lifting limb ratio ideal
what is that exactly glad you asked the
first
ingredient is having wide shoulders so
you can put gigantic pecs
shoulders and triceps and be an awesome
bench presser very few awesome bench
pressers with narrow shoulders
okay you can make an argument that wide
shoulders also create a very good perch
for the squat but maybe that's a minor
effect so at the very least wide
shoulders for excellent bench pressing
and
you want as much front to back thickness
as possible so that you have a less of a
range of motion
to actually move the bench press bar
through so super thick and super wide in
the upper body
what about arms well here's the trick
right if you don't want arms that are
too long
because that's going to make you suck at
the bench but if your arms are too short
it makes you suck at the deadlift
so we want probably slightly longer arms
than average but that thicker torso
makes up for it so the end
uh means that the bench press range of
motion is roughly similar to someone of
that height
but the deadlift leverages are really
awesome and lastly and this is probably
the biggest ingredient
you want very short legs for power
lifting
two reasons one if you have short legs
specifically short femurs you don't have
to
go through a huge range of motion to
squat and all of a sudden you can squat
a load more than a bunch of people
because people are like
moving like a foot this is
that's the way power lifting works it's
not judged on how far you move
is do you hit parallel if you have baby
femurs we all know that hitting parallel
is just not as hard as if you have super
 long femurs
now your tibia also matter the shorter
your tibia are
with any given arm length and torso
length the closer you are to the ground
and the easier it is to deadlift because
you have a short range of motion and
your leverages are better because you
start off in essentially a rack pull
position
so if you have a normal length torso
roughly that's really wide
really thick average to slightly average
uh to slightly longer than average arms
and pretty short legs you're
well on your way
to having the ideal limb ratios for
power lifting and last point
you want hands as big as possible
because
super long fingers big hands and even
the big palm area there
lets you grip a dead lifting bar because
grip is a legit limiting factor for tons
of people on their deadlift it's not the
sexiest part of the sport
but it's absolutely true so if you have
gigantic hands
pretty long average to above average
length arms
huge width huge thickness and short legs
i just described dead cohen by the way
then genetically limb ratio wise you are
just
going to be ahead of the pack and if you
have a bunch of these others you're
gonna be sweet at powerlifting
just to put an illustration to this as
to how this works imagine
having really really short arms really
narrow rib cage and uh super narrow
shoulders
and super long femurs and extra long
tibia
there are definitely sports you can be
pretty good at with that build power
lifting is going to be a
 uphill battle because you're
going to be you need these little gator
arms
deadlifting is going to be
impossible you say well you need arms
you can bench a lot but you have this
really small chest so you just don't
have the musculature to bench a ton and
then squatting sucks because you
have to squat like 10 feet down and 10
feet back up
it's and you if people come in
every limb ratio
on a spectrum from one extreme i just
described to add cohen
everyone's somewhere in the middle here
for the most part closer you are that
way to add cone
the better it is for your power lifting
number seven
neuroplasticity for output improvement
ability this is a no-brainer
some people's nervous systems adapt
really robustly and really quickly
and are able to increase the strength
and coordination between the muscles
that's really sweet some people's
nervous systems don't adapt as much if
your nervous system adapts very quickly
you're going to gain strength quickly
and become much stronger in the end
number eight similar this these these
two last ones
are the same as they are from the
hypertrophy one but they're absolutely
uh really worth repeating injury
proclivity
okay in hypertrophy training remember i
said that there are ways around it like
if you find out you have really just
frail tendons you can do really high rep
ranges and still get great growth maybe
even
some of the best growth you'll ever see
you can slow eccentrics
you can use super ranges of motion
instead of super heavy loads
so on and so forth you can do
pre-exhaust there are options for you as
long as that local muscle is taken close
to failure
in something under you know 30 35 or 40
reps per set
man you're going to be growing look if
you get injured regularly
with sets of 30 me you're way on
the genetic extreme of injury risk right
so
most people can make it work if they
know about it if they're just trying
like everyone else
if they're pure bodybuilding and just
doing hypertrophy in strength
there's just no way around it if you
have frail connective tissues
you get strong enough you're gonna get
hurt okay squatting 500 kilos
produces the same average tendon forces
on pretty much everyone with the same
frame
can your tendons handle the force it's
yes or no if they can
 sweet you're golden you can get
your muscles as big as they can
the rest of you as strong as possible
and tendons won't be a leading factor
if you have relatively weak connective
tissues it's kind of sad because you're
going to see explosive strength gains
with good genetics in the beginning of
your career
you're just going to start to get hurt a
lot and at some point there's just not
really anything to do about that
so that sucks why is this really
important
it's important to note that when you're
looking to the strongest people
sometimes it's because they really know
their stuff sometimes because they have
excellent genetics for getting jacked
and really strong
but sometimes it's just because they
have really awesome injury resistance
genetics
which is a problem in two ways one you
get sort of fundamentally misattribute
their success
to other stuff and you try to get wisdom
from that but it's really because they
just been at it
for a long time and never got hurt of
course they got strong
but the other part is a little bit more
of a dark side and it's this
sometimes these people do programs that
would get anyone else hurt
like benching ultra heavy four times a
week
round back deadlift like that i
just don't get hurt and you
think well i gotta deadlift 800. i'm
gonna use his program use this program
you break in half in three
months
you're like oh my god what happened well
it turns out neither you nor he knew
that he had phenomenal genetics
for just injury resistance and please
keep that in mind
don't copy other people's programs try
to get the wisdom out of them and make
programs yourself but be very careful
try to under try to always be safe
but slowly push the boundaries of
strength to try to figure out how likely
you are to get hurt and if you get hurt
often
pay really serious attention to it and
at some point if you're powerlifting
and you just from really good normal
training
that you think is pretty intelligent
it's not overly risky if you just get
hurt a lot
sometimes it can mean putting down the
sword and picking up the hypertrophy
sword
and fighting with that for a while
because some people used to be power
lifters just start getting hurt
and they just didn't want anymore then
they switched hypertrophy chain it turns
out they're really good at it and they
made very successful careers
and more importantly still have
something to do in the gym which they
loved which drove them so on and so
forth so if you find yourself getting
hurt a lot and powerlifting of course
try to clean up your technique
make your training better so on and so
forth but sometimes when you get strong
enough
man you just weren't designed to be
lifting loads like that at the
connective tissue level you could just
be getting her frequently
there may be ways around that going into
another alley
uh unfortunately if you're doing
everything right if your competitive
power lifter
at some point is 300 kilos on the bar
either you break or not and that's up to
your genetics largely
last one number nine similar to the
hypertrophy one
there has to be a psychology for
enjoying specifically
heavy training a desire to go heavier
and of course work proclivity because if
you're a lazy piece of you're
probably not going to be that good at
powerlifting because you're going to
skip a bunch of sessions
there's an extra part here which is of
course as all human psychological traits
are nearly all
very highly genetically mediated as this
i would determine a certain
ballsiness for approaching heavy loads
that just scare the out of people
okay there's people are on a spectrum of
what they feel
about an ultra heavy load loaded on the
bar in front of them at one other
spectrum people are like dude that
shit's gonna break me in half there's no
way i'm lifting that weight
look the bar is physically bending and
it's made of steel
just sitting there and you guys know
that like you know with a normal bar
once you load more than four or five on
it physically just starts to bend just
sitting in the rack you're like dude
what the
there's some people in one of the
spectrum there's absolutely no business
they just don't want it at all
they don't make the greatest power
lifters even if they get strong enough
they just never push the loads high
enough
to realize their true potential on the
other end are people that just don't
give a flying
actually in the opposite they care they
want the heavy load
the thing they get up in the morning for
what excites them is that bar bending
is the challenge of placing their body
it's a confidence
and a sort of like drive to go into
psychotically heavy dare i say sometimes
dangerous territory
those are the folks that if they have
the good injury genetics and their
technique is decent they have spotters
they're the ones that end up at the top
more often than not because
they're driven towards going as heavy as
heavy's heavy as possible some people
just don't have it in them and that's
really really
important all right so
that's a lot of stuff cool intellectual
masturbatory exercise
what do we take away from it major
take-home points
so some of these genetic influences you
can know in advance i mean clearly your
limb ratios just look in the
mirror
some may have to train and find out you
never really know how many satellite
cells you got back there until you start
using them
right so it's not apparently you know
there's no test for a bunch of this
stuff
cool interestingly if you do 23andme
they have a few subtests of like what's
your proclivity for a muscular physique
uh or you know strength power sports and
that tells you something but not not a
whole lot not a very
well developed science just quite yet
now here's a big kicker
folks that start out big and strong
usually end up
bigger and stronger than everybody else
but not always sometimes folks start out
being very very small but they just have
a really high adaptive proclivity
their body's ability to change at
multiple levels is really really good
they have a lot of sort of ability to
change in reserve
reps and reserve rer joke you'll be the
first one to make it go ahead and put it
in the comments
so people sometimes start out
just unimpressive either strength or
size
and they just go and go and go and
sooner or later they're enormous
or they're really really strong luckily
that happened for me
i was um in high school and i had been
as light as
a hundred pounds in my freshman year of
high school my
i started lifting my freshman year of
high school in my sophomore year was 120
junior i was 135 to 140
senior year i was 160 freshman year of
college it was 180. sophomore year was
like 190 to 200.
junior year i was like 220. senior i was
up
as much as a fat 230 and since then i've
been up between sort of
2 15 and 270 at various levels of
fatness and leanness
steadily gaining muscle for what must be
like 21 years at this point
lucky me but i would have never known
that i was one of the weakest
people in my gym class
for lifting freshman year like by a long
shot i incline pressed
55 pounds for 10 reps to failure my
freshman year
and that's when i was a pudgy early
freshman i was 120 pounds i mean
 there's a bunch of girls in my
school that were stronger than me right
at the end of high school i was one of
the strongest kids in high school and
then so on and so forth and i was really
big and really strong and tada
bodybuilding competitor and all that bs
so you never can quite tell
until you try it we'll get to that in
just a second
how many of these things do you need to
be really good well very few people
have all of these factors like all nine
factors fiber trophy for example very
few people have all of them maxed out
okay perhaps none but
so so so what that says is there's
always room for competition
okay you very rarely have a lifter
that's so much stronger than everyone
or so much bigger than everyone that no
one can even touch them okay because
usually they have like something in the
90th percentile of a bunch of these
but 80s and the others and some other
guy has 90 percentile in others and 80s
and the others and
sort of they meet roughly at the same
place and it makes for good competition
however
when someone has a lot of these peg sort
of scale high these
genetics as far as as it goes in
humanity sort of the best genetics for
multiple components
that's how dynasties form so if you
think about someone like phil heath
his muscle bellies are absurd and his
ability to put on muscle rapidly is also
absurd just to pick two factors and
there's tons of underlying factors there
also uh you know his limb ratios are
good and i didn't mention that it sort
of goes into muscle valleys like
if you have really long legs you can
have gigantic legs because
there's more stuff to put on
he's in that category where he's just
really hard to beat and of course he has
been beaten since but he was on a
dynasty for a long time because
what do you do with that good of
genetics you just have to have great
genetics to combat it
and at some point maybe not everyone or
most people
or all people in the world really aren't
there at his level at that time
and that's how dynasties occur same with
ronnie coleman lee haney
arnold schwarzenegger jay cutler all
those folks had enough of the good
genetics to really propel them just a
little bit ahead of the pack
of course they did everything else very
well also and that kept them above
for a long time now what does this come
down to as far as for you
here's the deal at the end of the day
you can figure out your initial
conditions pretty easy like if you're
just a jack little kid when you're 12
like yeah
if it's easy you're jacked you have
better than average starting genetics
nobody gives a about your starting
genetics because the only thing people
care about
really everyone else doesn't care about
you at all the only thing you should
care about is where you end up after
years of training
and adaptability is really sometimes
even non-linear
and difficult to predict perhaps
impossible in many cases
practically speaking so how do you know
if you have good genetics
because adaptability is more important
than your initial conditions
you just have to try it and how long do
you have to try it for well my
recommendation
is if it's really important to you to
find out because if it's not
just
don't even lift or lift for a month and
be like this i hate it if it's
really important do you find out
how good your genetics are go to the gym
seriously eat seriously sleep seriously
for three years or so
if you're not a little better than the
average person who's been training for
three years
or maybe not a little better but making
 real good gains
you probably have not the best genetics
okay because i've spoken to quite a few
people over the course of my career
who are on that i could say unfortunate
but i won't in that group of people that
like
they've been training pretty diligently
and eating pretty well for like three
years
or maybe even five years in some cases
and they're just like
advanced as far as the rate of gain like
they're eeking away tiny gains
and they're just not impressive looking
or on the numbers they're not they're
like
135 pounds and five foot eight been
training and eating
hard for three to five years when they
do mass phases they mostly gain fat when
they do cutting phases they lose some
fat and some muscle
and you're just like and and a lot of
folks will ask like
what's the answer for me like what do i
do check your blood work make sure
testosterone blah blah blah
but after you get through all those
basics that three to five year trial
period for them is kind of like
look you know like if you love training
and you like
sort of the process and where your body
is now and maybe
a little bit further that you can go
 awesome hey
it's great train away but if you really
were intent on just being
enormous and veiny and shredded and you
know looking like
just like a human penis basically uh
then man it just might not be in the
cards for you
i'll be more particular what i'm trying
to say if you gave a real good
college effort to a good college try and
after three years of pretty serious
eating
pretty serious training if you're
getting if you're not where you want to
be
as far as gains or here i'll put it
another way if you're not
gained to a very impressive amount
relative to other people that have been
training that long
or your rate of gains has really
plateaued there's probably
not this magic solution that we're not
thinking of and certainly the solution
isn't to look into the nuances of your
training
you'll notice that people with good
genetics just kind of grow
you're like hey did you grow with rir
training yep do you grow with failure
training yep
low volume grew high volume also grew
like a lot of
people who have good genetics they just
 grow like i have really good pec
genetics
um my packs respond to a bunch of
matter of fact i won't train my pecs
directly for a long time and they'll be
the same size and i'll start training
them directly and they're just a
group right
if you want to ask someone else about
pec size and how to get it they may be
better than me
just if i only knew my own experiences
because what the do i know i have
great genetics
when you have really good genetics sort
of everything works when you have really
bad genetics
no amount of nuance is going to get you
to the good genetic side
or even to a real decent rate of gains
so that's kind of the harsh truth but
you don't know that truth
until you've put in the time some people
train for six months and not a whole lot
happens like dude this is i can
quit keep going because some people
after six months maybe with something in
your nutrition
maybe it just took some time maybe they
figured out some exercise that worked
well for them maybe they determine their
volume landmarks train a lot more train
a lot less
and all of a sudden after month six they
start growing and growing growing after
three years like holy they got it
and quit
right but if after three to five years
in this position where you really think
you did a really good job uh go through
our earlier videos
of like uh checklist items for
troubleshooting your growth and strength
if you've gone through that you're
looking like i basically do all this
pretty well and i have been for
the last two years if you're not getting
the results
that are comparable to your peer group
yeah like your generics aren't that
great good news it doesn't
matter
because you can go and have a beautiful
life with a beautiful family and friends
and be super productive for the rest of
society uh and have an amazing time of
it without being
dedicated to spending hours in the gym
staring at weights that'll never
love you back
like i'm doing can you guys still see me
am i still bright orange see you next
time
