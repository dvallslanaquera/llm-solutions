hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
purisation today's ultra nerdy super
nerdy
pocket protector glasses wearing getting
punched in the face in the schoolyard
type nerdy topic is
emg electromyography and hypertrophy
and the specific question of what can
emg studies which are very often cited
tell us
about what muscle growth is or is not
going on
so emg is used very often in
research and exercise science and sports
has in general and very often in
hypertrophy research emg stands for
electromyography it is technically the
measurement of
some of the electrical activity of
muscles
the motor nerve the sort of neuron
designed to tell the muscle to contract
does so by releasing uh some chemicals
and then these chemicals bond to the
muscle itself or to the surface of the
muscle and that starts an electrical
cascade which wraps around the whole
muscle and actually penetrate penetrates
in some cases deep into the muscle and
that electrical cascade is something
that we can measure to some extent a
decent extent not perfect with
electromyography right and that
electrical cascade doesn't itself
contract the muscle but it has a few
other things happen afterwards that
result in muscle contraction so as you
can tell already there's a bit of a
difference between electrical activity
and actual muscle contraction and some
of that is where the nuance happens
where we have to say well if an emg
study says this that doesn't exactly
mean muscle contraction because
sometimes people say it's one on the
other however emg is a pretty decent
proxy on average of muscle contraction
but not all the time
so
because emg
is some kind of proxy some attempt at
measurement of muscle activity it has
often been used to infer hypertrophic
outcome differences that would result if
you continue to train in let's say two
different ways one of them gets you very
high emg readings one of them gets you
lower the proposition there is that the
higher emg readings would cause more
hypertrophy in the long run because
ostensibly the higher emg readings
reflect more muscle contraction and
muscle contraction over time generates
tension and
propels or stimulates rather
muscle growth so far
most of that is roughly true
and the way we use that is a couple of
different ways in the resource
literature first
people can compare things like
pre and post exhaust do my pack flies
first then i do bench or i do bench
first then peck flies see which one of
those orders gets you better electrical
activity as measured by mg and then you
say well whichever one
does grows more muscle
may or may not be true but we'll get to
that in a bit
another thing people like to use emg for
is to figure out the difference between
exercise variations like a sumo squat
versus a regular squat seeing which one
you know activates the glutes more
seemingly or activates the quads more
and thus making inferences on which one
you should do to grow the glutes or
quads pretty common
another one is different loading
paradigms you take the same exercise
have some people do sets of five
have other people do sets of 20 see how
the emg results are affected and you say
well it seems that the heavier loading
affects
the emg better and thus heavier loading
maybe promotes more muscle contraction
and maybe more growth that's a something
that people speculate on a lot of times
it's between different exercises a
pretty common approach is taking
something like squats and pairing it
with something or pairing it
oppositionally against something like
hip thrusts trying to see emg activity
and trying to figure out which one grows
the glutes more
and then another one that's very common
lately is ranges of motion
within the same exercise so you have emg
you have let's say a bench press one
group does here to here
lockout type of reps one group does
partial reps from the lower end range
and you see which one has the higher emg
values and you try to infer which one is
going to grow more muscle right and a
whole bunch of different ones
different study designs that are roughly
pointing at kind of similar similar
stuff and this is a fine way to use emg
as long as you know about the potential
limitations
that's what this video is about
the potential limitations of using emg
and there are at least 10 of them this
is not an inclusive list but it's close
so here we go
what are the potential differences
between what we want to assume that emg
equals hypertrophy or in first
hypertrophy very exactly or the
alternate idea that emg may be
not inferring hypertrophy at all or only
to a very small and highly error prone
extent
so first limitation
is that electrode position
relative to the muscle on the surface of
the skin
can make it seem that one exercise one
way of doing an exercise
or part of the range of motion of an
exercise
is really really good at generating
tension through emg but the reality is
that the emg just picks up
certain range of motion better than
another easy example is this if you put
a bunch of emg leads at the very top of
the lat for example an exercise in which
the lattice stretch then you come down
to here
is going to have a lot of emg activity
whereas an exercise that goes from here
to here might have a similar amount of
activity because the lat's still
involved on the other hand if you put
emg leads lower if the lat activity if
the exercise is down here with the lat
you're going to get a lot of emg
activity but up here
the lat stretches out and a lot of the
lat stretching occurs under the skin
it's not paired exactly to the skin emg
leads stay at the same point in the skin
but the lat muscle moves away from where
the leads are so it can look like this
is not a very good lat exercise but the
real problem was that the emg leads were
placed lower and thus inherently biased
that the shorter range of motion or the
lower range of motion down here
seems to be more muscle activity
generating and thus more hypertrophic so
if you interpret a study like this
without being very careful where you
place your emg leads which actually
happens in studies way more often than
you would hope for then all of a sudden
you conclude hey lat pull downs from
here to here as opposed to here are
better for hypertrophy where maybe the
opposite is the case so that's a big
problem
next one
probably a very small problem but
nonetheless something we have to be keen
on
is that emg as done in most research
facilities is what's called surface emg
you place leads that are not penetrating
the skin they have tape around them or
sticky substance you just place them
directly onto the muscle but it's not
really the muscle because it's the skin
and they are very good at detecting
electrical activity of the muscle just
deep to the skin but they're much better
at detecting activity of a muscle that
is superficial
versus deep so for example your quad can
be fucking enormous there's all kinds of
muscles deep to your quad and the
adductors and stuff like that and if you
place emg leads on your quad especially
for subjects that have a relatively high
body fat a lot of females store lots of
body fat in their quads for example you
can compare two different ways of
squatting or something like that and say
well gee
this one has way higher emg activity
which you might be looking at is
actually the deep musculature
was way more active in one position or
one exercise and the surface musculature
was more active in another position or
another exercise and because we only
have a very biased look at the surface
automatically the deep activity could be
the same amount of muscle activity and
could lead to the same growth but we're
saying ah this exercise variation sucks
because it didn't have the emg readings
and it's not because it actually sucked
it's because our emg is much better at
reading on the surface than it is deep
now i'm over exaggerating a little bit
because it's not much better but there
is a difference if you want to really
look into what's going on there's a
variety of approaches you can take one
of them is called fine wire emg
get ready if you're queasy just mute
this for a while you take a really fine
wire that looks a lot like a needle and
you stick it into the muscle as deep as
you want and you can stick it at a bunch
of different depths it kind of looks
like acupuncture i guess
and then the person does the curls or
the extensions or whatever and then you
actually see what's going on deep inside
the muscle and sometimes that's
marginally different enough than surface
electromyography that the results aren't
exactly what you thought they would be
and that's just something we have to
keep our eyes on it's not a huge thing
it's a very small thing and there are
other
elements in this list that are much more
uh pronounced in their difference but
something we have to be at least
intellectually aware of
next
is an enormous huge huge thing
that renders a lot of emg interpretation
and inference to hypertrophy as like
gee really troublesome and here it is
generally speaking
electromyography
biases
higher readings you get higher seemingly
higher muscle activity and oftentimes
actual muscle activity
the highest is usually an isometric
contraction so if you have a bench bar
that's just fixed in place and you go
and push on it as hard as possible emg
readings are amazing
the next highest one lower is concentric
so if you push a bench press like this
they have amg readings usually you don't
get as high of emg readings in the
concentric as you do in an isometric so
someone could say okay
there's less muscle activity here i'll
get to the point in a sec the lowest emg
readings are typically in the eccentric
phase lowering the bench press
we could be tempted to conclude
that from those readings alone highest
emg readings that isometric second
highest concentric lowest edicentric
would give us the thought that well g
that means the isometric grows the most
muscle concentric the second most in
eccentric dead last
the reality is actually completely
backwards making this probably one of
the bigger whopper points of this
presentation it turns out
by a small margin at least
eccentrically biased stimuli probably
the most muscle growing
concentric is in second place
and isometric
is in last place on average right by
small margin all of them are good for
growth but if we just interpret emg
readings at face value
we can literally conclude the opposite
of what is true and that is not good
now
it's very very easy when you're doing
the same exercise
and doing the eccentric analysis
concentric analysis isometric analysis
uh you know if you're familiar with this
literature you can at least say well i
know what i'm looking at and i know that
they're going to have higher energy
readings than is really inferring a
fiber trip that's okay but the big
problem comes when you let's say examine
two different kinds of exercises let's
say a hack squat with a pause
and then a leg press with no pause and
say which one of these grows more muscle
well one of them may have a more
pronounced eccentric phase one of them
may have a more pronounced concentric
phase one of them this is very easy
especially with a pause may have a more
pronounced isometric phase and then
because those phases map onto emgs a lot
better
then they map onto hypertrophy where
actually they map onto hypertrophy
completely the opposite what you can do
is say well you know the average emg
amplitude of the leg press in this
condition was higher so that means that
hack squats won't grow as much muscle
but that might be because hack squats in
the way you set up the exercise and the
way you cued the technique have more of
any central component than the leg press
have a slightly less concentric
component and considerably less
isometric component that probably just
on growth muscle growth theory based on
what we know about these different
contraction types will make the hack
squat more muscle growing than the leg
press as you're doing it but the way you
read it just off of emg you concluded
the very opposite result and it's
complicated different phases and
activations in different exercises are
so complex that when we look at an emg
and we see one amg is higher than the
other you know overhead tricep
extensions beat regular skull crushers
or something we have to ask well is it
different phases
well and also is it surface versus deep
is it electrode position we have a bunch
of questions to ask now so as you can
tell the idea that emg equals a very
good proxy of hypertrophy is starting to
really slip away from us
aha but there's more but there's a lot
more point number four
long versus short muscle lengths
it seems pretty reliable in the
literature
that emg activity from here to here
is higher on average with the same load
same relative effort same everything
than it is from here to here okay longer
musclings you tend to have lower emg
activities
than you do at shorter muscle lengths
but
growth usually seems to occur better at
longer muscle lengths than shorter so
it's backwards again so now when you
have one exercise or one range of motion
showing better emg values you have to
ask yourself the question well hold up
let's look at the muscle links at least
on the surface to see if we've made an
egregious egregious error
right so
it can if we just don't do this
we only read the emgs and we find
studies and say well hey the emg here is
lower so that's stupid
then we end up concluding things that
are actually backwards
um
a very
classic example of this is if we study
like the lat prayer or the pullover
right for lats the emg activity from
here to here is really good the emg
activity from here to here is not so
good so people are tempted to say well
gee why would you even do this part if
the muscle's not nearly as active well
hold on a second we already know that at
longer muscle lengths
the muscle is
the emg readings don't correspond to the
tension produced by the muscle nearly as
much we also know that's the more
hypertrophic region so if we say well g
the emg readings say that this range of
motion for pullovers or lap pairs is
better than this one we could be
inferring the opposite of the truth we
have to be very very very careful
another limitation
is active versus passive force detection
so
if you have active force that means the
muscle itself is generating tension and
the emg is really pretty good at
detecting that
because the electrical activity of the
muscle is
you know you know the emg senses that
however
let's say you do a deep bench press and
at the bottom you relax your pecs
somewhat so the emg readings won't be
high but the force is still being
imparted and your pecs are actually
being pulled apart by heavy resistance
that generation of tension your muscles
are still feeling a fuck ton of tension
but the tension isn't coming as much
from their own contraction attempt it's
coming from gravity and barbell pulling
them apart and they have to generate
tension to resist
this has called passive tension
and it generates a crapload of
hypertrophy that you will completely
miss or almost completely miss with emg
analysis
so exercises that have a big passive
tension component one of which is let's
say you're squatting super deep and
you're taking a one second pause during
that one second pause if you let your
quads turn off or turn down it's going
to look like gee that bottom sucks why
would you even go that low your muscle
activity really drops off but the actual
tension experienced by the muscle fibers
is fucking enormous and causes a
shitload of hypertrophy it's actually
the most tension the muscles are
experienced the entire time they're just
not generating themselves it's being
generated for them passively so we don't
want to say emg
is maps exactly under hypertrophy
because we could be missing passive
versus active force detection and we
will actually we catch all the active we
miss a bunch of the passive passive
matters it's a big deal and we don't
want to miss
number six
this is a crazy one
and
it's really a trip so
emg notoriously favors heavier loading
so if you have the same exercise
you do a set of five with it let's say
to failure or very close the overall emg
amplitude is going to be really high
like holy shit your muscles are really
working
if you do a set of 20 with the same
exercise you know normalized to the
number of reps etc normalizes the total
stimulus the emg won't be as impressive
so we can be tempted to say well look
the mg of heavy loading is better than
the mg of light loading thus heavy
loading causes more growth we would be
tempted to do so we would be tempted to
say someone thinks so however we've
already done the long-term studies the
direct studies that literally show
actual hypertrophy we measure actual
muscle size with dexa and all these
other measurements
and we know for pretty damn near fact at
this point very high degree of certainty
that anything between roughly your 5rm
and roughly your 30rm causes a really
similar amount of growth maybe an
equivalent amount of growth some cases
higher reps actually cause more growth
in some cases lower ups cause more
growth but if we just went off emg alone
heavier loading automatically biases us
to think the emg well really a heavier
loading is really good
but we could be tempted to conclude that
higher repetitions or lighter loads or
even exercises that the repetitions are
the same but the amplitude exercise is
higher for example you move a longer
distance one exercise versus another and
it ends up being that the total time
spent generating tension of one exercise
is higher the other exercise is lower
and because of that the adjusted if you
go for 20 or 10 rms on both the 10 rem
on both
isn't actually the same relative load to
both
the shorter exercise shorter amplitude
is a much higher relative load and the
longer exercise is much more distance so
that it is 10 reps but it's the same
amount of contraction as the other
exercise would experience with like 15
reps and thus the exercise that has a
longer range of motion we say well yeah
per rep the emg amplitude's not as high
as this one
other exercise that has a lower one so
maybe it's not as much growth but
oftentimes exercises generate the most
range of motion not always but often
generate more growth so again this would
bring us to think these two things one
heavier loads are superior which they're
probably not
and two exercises which take a longer
time to do per rep and thus per set are
not as hypertrophic as they really are
in reality so again gee you know if we
started trying to put a pinch of salt to
muddy the waters we're now pouring all
kinds of fucking what do we just put in
their brew
dragon eyes
testicles of
eagle eagle testicles do eagles have
testicles
i don't know they have a cloak i know
that all right
not looking good for emg so far but
don't worry we'll try to save it at the
end
fatigue fatigue is a big one so
emg
is
picks up neural fatigue pretty well
nervous system fatigue pretty well
it doesn't pick up metabolic fatigue all
that well because it doesn't measure the
metabolism it measures muscle
uh contraction or sorry it measures
muscle electrical activity which if you
have a high level of metabolic fatigue
you could have the same amount of muscle
electrical activity as always
but a higher amount of growth per rep
because no metabolites grow muscle but
that's not picked up by the emg often
right so
you can have two situations just to show
you a hypothetical example of how this
can work if you have a low emg amplitude
and you don't have a ton of metabolites
right you could expect low growth and
actually low growth would occur
but if you have low emg for example the
last five reps of a 30 reps emg is not
very impressive because your nervous
system is tired uh you know and there's
excitation contraction
uncoupling like that little boundary
between the nerve and the muscle where
the neurotransmitters are supposed to go
through has all kinds of crap in it that
kind of came out of this damaged entire
muscle and now the muscle contraction
isn't stimulated you know some fraction
of the time that it's supposed to be the
nerve is like fire fire fire and the
muscle's like
god get out of my face i'm super tired i
always gunk everywhere i can't even hear
you so what ends up happening is in that
condition
you have the same low emg amplitude as
in the first but if you have a high
degree of metabolites in the muscle you
actually get some pretty decent growth
but in both conditions because if we're
going just off of emg we can think oh
it's both low growth conditions so
in this case we have ruled out high
growth where actually it occurs because
it occurs because of metabolites but emg
doesn't really pick up metabolites at
least not reliably at least not directly
so low emg does not lead to low growth
in all cases specifically those
regarding metabolites specifically in
high repetition sort of situations so
more moneying of the waters point number
eight
this is a big one and this is something
that we have to as scientifically-minded
people keep
in mind i could have said that better so
extrapolating from one muscle to another
is super common
people will say thing you know they'll
have an emg study that shows like hey
you know doing a partial range of motion
in this exercise
has higher emg amplitude than doing a
full range of motion or the other way
around
and thus you should do it like this and
uh you know you're you're going in
you're gonna go do squats and someone's
like you shouldn't do them like that you
should do them like this because of this
emg study you
go pull it up on your phone and it says
you know in triceps brachii and you're
like
this is a study on triceps and they're
like okay i'm doing my quads like okay
but it's a muscle look right so there's
a chance that's just general muscle
physiology that's been found out and it
works across all muscles that's very
possible but it's also possible that
this is a specific nuance of the triceps
or other muscles more similar to it and
does not apply to the quadriceps or to
the hamstrings or the calves or whatever
it is that you're doing and this asshole
is trying to feed you emg data stop
doing that do this
so it is an uncertainty that we have to
understand so if we want
to take emg studies
and we want to conclude from here's how
we change our training we had better be
very careful about not crossing from one
muscle to the other with full confidence
so if we have research that says hey for
the biceps bmg stuff says this works
can you use it for the forearms or for
the triceps or for the quads or for the
glutes you can absolutely you can you
can infer that this way of training that
the mg found was better
might be better than this other way of
training they found worse but that might
takes a probability cut off that's
pretty fucking decent so it you
shouldn't be coming up to people and
saying hey don't do this do that and
then when they say but this is a
different muscle you're going to have
like basically caught with your dick in
your hand you want to be like well hey
like from other research on other
muscles we've shown this is the case so
my best guess is that this will also be
the case here but if they try it it
doesn't seem to be working and they
don't get a sword as pumped or whatever
then you should be like okay that makes
sense because we were inferring from one
muscle to another and that's not always
possible right
so few emg studies for now and
so many muscles are so much easier to
study than others that a lot of times
you have like 10 quad emg studies 15
biceps studies three triceps one lat and
that's it nobody
ever emg's the uh
the important muscle
electrodes you know where or do you am i
talking about
number one end or the number two end
that's for you to figure out at home in
any case
number nine
single study limitations a lot of times
one emg study will come out saying the
lats you know the better trained last
like doesn't like that so that one study
has every single thing i said so far as
a limitation including the fact that
it's just one study
like in the real world
emg studies especially easy to fuck up
there's this thing called crosstalk
where you have emg leads and the cables
come close to each other or the two
leads are too close
then one lead picks up electrical
activity from this and also from the
lead and also from the
the you know the electrically
let's say you have some kind of machine
there that has an electrical plug in it
uh they could also pick up on that it's
crazy right so emg you would think put
this lead on and it gives you exactly
the electrical activity with no error
that's not even remotely close if you're
very careful you can do a great job but
in the real world one study at a time
like you know a lot of times the primary
researcher who's on the publication or
his first name on the publication or the
last he's not actually doing the study
or she's not actually around much of the
time just some of the time what you have
is you know bright undergraduates and
graduate students doing the actual study
and like they can fuck shit up i've seen
it happen myself when i was in this
environment so is does that mean that
all studies are bullshit and the grad
students just making up numbers fuck no
most of them are pretty good but pretty
good doesn't mean perfect so
a single study if it says this versus
that it's probably not a good idea to
take your entire training program and
upend it because a single study said the
lats don't do this they do that through
emg never mind the fact that there's
eight other fucking reasons to be
skeptical of the not cynical skeptical
of the emg but now this is another one
where you think okay one study if a
couple more studies come out
i'll be more likely to change
my training than if it was just one
study because one study can say all
kinds of weird shit i just wouldn't
nothing to hang your hat on although
people really hang their hats on stuff
anymore back in the 50s you should show
up someone's house and like man see and
they're like yeah and you had a hat and
a suit and they'd be like man hang your
hat here see and you're like man
yeah
like that
i does that even happen i don't know i
guess people in suits don't really come
over your house much anymore unless
the you know the feds want to talk to
you do they even wear hats shit
all right
10 our last limitation that at least i
could think of and whatever amount of
time it took me to make this
presentation
this is a real big problem as far as i
know as of the um filming of this video
there may be as few as zero studies that
have actually taken
emg readings at the beginning
emg readings maybe a couple times during
the study over the course of eight to
twelve weeks
and seen how the emg analysis because
emg is going to say well this way of
doing triceps is better this way is
worse because emg here is low emg here
is high
take that
same subject same study and actually
measure muscle growth over eight to
twelve weeks and see who wins
because you would think well emg is a
proxy for muscle growth but that it is a
proxy for muscle growth has never been
formally tested
there is at least one study out now that
did the same thing with the pump right
they they tested who got the biggest
pumps from a given level of volume of
all the subjects at the beginning of the
study and then they just trained them
and saw who got more jacked surprised
the people that got the best pumps got
the most jacked so pump is now at least
with one study not so convincing but a
good place to start a somewhat
marginally validated
instrument by which to you by which to
infer hypertrophy a validated proxy not
very well validated but i got something
emg i'm not aware of any studies that
have correlated emg outcomes with actual
hypertrophy in the same study so like
gee whiz you know that's kind of a
problem and just one study wouldn't be
overly convincing so if one of these
studies come out we could at least be
like oh wow it's good it's a 70 accurate
proxy for that muscle for those two
exercises for that group of individuals
we need a few more studies to really
become confident the fact that it's a
good proxy currently i think we have
zero and maybe i missed it but even if
we have one or two you know we can do
better and if we're really gonna be
saying in reading emg literature as if
it's like hey this is what hypertrophy
means
we want more than zero and more than one
or two studies right so that's the last
limitation putting that all together
what is sort of my verdict at least
personally on using emg
here it is emg is one tool by which we
predict and proxy muscle growth
and here's the thing
it's not
a
guarantee of what's going on it's a hint
at what might be going on
and should be the basis a basis one of
the bases for trying things in the gym
you read an emg study you go oh
interesting i never thought of doing lat
pull downs like that i'll try it and
then you try it and you see
does the stimulus to fatigue ratio work
out like do you get better tension in
your lats with this are your lats
burning more are you getting better lat
pumps do your lats seem more disrupted
more sore more tired etc how are your
joints feeling
if the emg says do it like this it's
correct and it turns out it is fuck yeah
awesome but if it you try it and really
diligently try it out you're like this
is backwards this this thing is fucking
stupid the emg
must not have said the right thing well
fuck man you got 10 really good ass
reasons why the emg could have been
wrong so don't worry about being like
but the cmg study how am i going to
hashtag signs how am i going to you know
hashtag be evidence based if i'm
ignoring emg literature not ignoring it
you're integrating it understanding that
could be a hint at what's going on but
it's like 50 000 light years away from
being exactly what is going on as the
perfect proxy right the mg studies are
not the last word they're not like
hashtag fuck yes science they're just a
hint and if you use them intelligently
like that with a great bit of skepticism
you're actually hashtag evidence based
and then you know i don't know what
happens next i guess if you put shit on
instagram
hashtag evidence based you like wait for
30 minutes check your dms and these
evidence-based nerd girls just come out
of the fucking woodwork and they're like
hey oh my god i heard your
evidence-based ah and you're like will
you go on a date with me and they're
like of course but you've gotta cite
publications during the date you're like
fuck how to study for a date
i love it i can't wait just talk about
literature into the hours of the night
passionate sex you guys know the rest
that's real life so
here's the thing
that was cool that was a lot of learning
however there is always more learning to
be done
four ways that you can learn much more
i'm not actually an expert on emg
but we have lots of experts at emg and
one of them maybe the preeminent expert
on skepticism towards emgs and a very
very amazing biomechanist in his own
right andrew vigotsky he's like a
professor and everything he's the real
deal i'm just some guy on youtube and
here is how you can access some of his
work he has been interviewed by omar and
eric on iron culture podcast which is a
fucking great podcast you should just
subscribe to it anyway his video is
specifically linked in the description
below
andrew has talked about emg in another
video
an earlier video which i've also linked
for you guys and he's written two papers
with a few collaborators on skepticism
of emg and hypertrophy linked together
and i've linked both of those papers for
you in the description
so yeah go ahead and read that shit it
gets a little complicated because
andrew's smart as fuck but uh you know
if some of this wasn't super convincing
or it was but you want to learn more and
get in the nuance that's the place to do
it folks thank you so much if i board
you to tears wipe those tears away
hashtag evidence based on your instagram
and go on a crazy evidence-based date
