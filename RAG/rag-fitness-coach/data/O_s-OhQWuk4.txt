competing I have to have my pieces
raised by June 9th and we're going to
use a vaccine so it might feel a little
bit of work needed but I'm excited and
after that I will be not to metamorphose
well it's a matter of my eating my
vegetables as opposed to the ice cream
we're not trying to get rid of
persuasion we just we want some wisdom

I'm here about malformation and or top
you okay this is the stars are born
oh wow that's like the world's smallest
bathroom there was trying Dix
seafood okay let's look at that my very
travel essentials ground turkey and
chicken yeah that's our fridge so all I
ate today was Shake chicken and
vegetables and I had a half of a public
sub and that's I think and I had a
protein bar so that's look for both of
the protein s actually pretty solid if
I'm not tracking like I'm not today I'll
just try to get four or five solid
bonuses of protein and by that I mean
like 25 to 35 grams per meal and I kind
of let the calories fall where they may
focus on eating very satiating foods
I find that cracking at the start of a
diet is really helpful to kind of get
things moving and give you a ballpark
oats where your calories are and then
once I find things are moving once I
started losing weight I thought I can
switch over to a more intuitive approach
really easily and so that's what I've
done for the last few days and I
actually find it to be more effective
probably because I just naturally eat
less when I focus on just eating more
high volume more powerful
it includes rather than trying to hit a
specific core target if I'm just
intuitively eating up have a little bit
of an uncollected satisfy demand stop
mini cut is effectively kind of over so
now my goal is going to be maintenance
here and I feel like I will tighten up a
little bit as I start to fill out and
increase tons it or 145 by 1040 going
for a late dinner we're here and we need
to go there oh really this little voice
