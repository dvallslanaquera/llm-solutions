oh Mike oh Dr Mike for Renaissance
periodization
guess what
I know something about you
you have a problem and you haven't
talked to anyone about him that's okay
because this is a safe space between me
you and thousands of other viewers
and the NSA which has your search
history you sick
you are worried
about your triceps not being big enough
now for the record
I think your triceps are absolutely
wonderful exactly the way they are
but other people may not agree with you
you may not agree with me and you may
want bigger triceps and because of that
close grip bench press for the triceps
[Applause]
let's fix it let's find out how to
modify this exercise to make sure you
get the most out of your chives as
possible
Mike
stop it with these stupid long intros if
you're not a comedian you're not funny
you have no friends your dick is small
you're trying to overcompensate just get
to the tips already fine
all right folks first tip is to get a
nice solid foundation
which means you are going to slightly
retract your shoulder blades not as much
as you would for the regular bench press
but just enough to keep the shoulders
nice and safe and out of the way you can
arch your back a little bit and you're
going to make sure you plant your feet
into the ground this will give you a
really stable base from which to push
relatively heavy loads why because there
are many many tricep exercises that
isolate your triceps but do not allow
super heavy loading because it was
awkward weird one joint at a time not so
safe feeling you can really do sets of
five to ten ten to Fifteen on here and
for that you want a really stable base
it's terrible for me when I go to like
regular gyms or whatever not this RP gym
we have and see people trying to lift
heavy but their feet are like this or
even the stupid thing where they put
their feet up which does nothing except
destabilize you and give you less of a
good workout unless you're training to
be like a performance seal at SeaWorld
and you can bench with your feet up so
what you want to do is set up something
like this
just lay down on the bench
shoulders back a little bit
chest up a little bit
my feet are firmly planted this means
that when I start close grip benching
that I am able
to generate a crap load of Power with my
triceps
and everything goes Super well
voila
[Music]
oh hey you're back for tip number two
this one's going to be a tiny little
wrap but bear with me grip width
a lot of people
think that the narrower the grip is the
better the triceps work so you'll see
this in a lot of gyms
where they'll take a grip like this
and they'll do their because you
physically can't touch your
chest with this it's by definition
a partial and sometimes if they're
stocky and thick enough it's a partial
on this end and a partial on this end
you're yourself twice
it turns out that if the triceps go
through a very large range of motion and
especially are stretched at the bottom
even a wider grip can work super well so
my best advice to you on grip other than
what you feel is best for your body is
to take a grip that is just outside
of your rib cage width so it's as close
as possible but you can still get the
full depth of going all the way down for
me that's probably one finger in line
with the bar here I'm gonna guess really
quick and so I'm going to do this
notice the bar comes down
I'm actually floating right here
I'm resting completely on my biceps I'm
not touching my chest if there was real
weight I absolutely could touch
this is a really close to Ideal grip for
me and notice my hands are positioned
just outside of my ribs any closer too
much any wider it turns into a bench
press that isn't really for the triceps
anymore
just outside of rib position is really
really great
but it's only great if it works with our
next tip
[Music]
as you descend
in the close grip bench it is critical
maybe not critical helpful
that you keep your elbows flush to your
sides
this
is just fine and dandy but that's a lot
of chest because we're flaring out and
the chest does that motion
if you keep your elbows close in you can
really really load the triceps
now you can't lift as much weight like
this and it's absolutely imperative that
to maximize this function you do a slow
eccentric and during that slow eccentric
you want to feel your triceps and then
press up
triceps with elbows and elbows and
elbows and elbows in press triceps in in
in in
press that's how you do this right
that's how you get the most out of this
move
[Music]
one of the things that grows muscle a
lot
is a deep stretch at the bottom
if we're training our triceps
it is true that if we want to lift a lot
of weight
we can push the bar down to below the
nipple line
and the elbow angle isn't going to be
insanely High there's a stretch there
but not a ton you'll be able to lift a
lot of weight if you do this sweet if
you want to win the close grip bench
World Championships amazing what I want
to convince you guys to at least try
is to turn the close grip bench into a
little bit of a JM press okay a JM press
is something that goes to your chin or
your neck or your clavicles generally
your clavicles
but we're not going to go that far we're
just going to do a little bit of just
above the nipple line you guys see how
down here it's a little bit of a skull
crusher type of feel my arms are kind of
going this way a little bit this is too
much we don't want this this is a
different exercise this is a jam press
yeah this is standard but just one inch
here and I can feel my triceps
stretching like crazy
press out elbows in and the entire time
you have your elbows in and down and
you're looking to press a little bit
higher on the chest that's a shitload of
triceps it feels kind of like a skull
crushery thing and here's the big kicker
if you Bench close grip down to your
sternum
yes you can lift more weight
but also it involves your triceps less
it stretches them less it makes them
less limiting factor
and in that regard it can actually work
your chest a lot they've done direct
research on EMG and stuff like that and
they realize that close grip bench
pressing as most people do it really is
still predominantly a chest exercise and
it's just not that great of a tricep
movement
but to get more out of triceps in close
grip bench which is the whole
point of this video
try to do a little bit of where you
don't touch with the nipple line just
one inch above
and as you go down you will feel your
triceps and you'll feel like crazy at
the bottom and on the way up you have to
use less weight you have to be more
meticulous more controlled but I promise
you there's a very good chance it pays
off in your triceps will get nuclear
