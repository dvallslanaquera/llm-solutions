how do you time your breathing because I
find with the slow negative in the pause
I I do get a little bit light-headed
yeah you just fight through those High
Reps you just keep breathing
just before you get to the bottom okay
and then come on so you're doing a kind
of a double breath sometimes on rep
triple four okay okay okay okay
because I was trying to do the power
lifter uh valsalza the whole way and I
was starting to lose you're gonna pass
off trying that so I'm listening
for rest pause and rap yes and that's it
and I'm going to control the negative
yes and I'm going to pause for about a
second yes okay quality better to make a
rep harder than easier
