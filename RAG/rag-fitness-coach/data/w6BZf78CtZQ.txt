[Music]
come on one more
yeah
finish that's it that's it just roll out
of
[Music]
it yo Dr Mike here for Renaissance
spiration let me put you on to some
Peter Pan doesn't age and he hangs out
with children Island full of kids that's
kind of weird right doesn't age well in
the epsteen era but I feel like in my
older age I just went to Giant Island
giant is full of giant tasty men oh in
the real Eric janicki here is a fraking
animal he eats other men and I did not
mean that look I don't know I don't want
to pry into your daily life I meant that
however you want me to mean it but
anyway he's really big what are you 285
like 295 295 my man's up close to 300
pound range and just in case I didn't
feel small already my biological son
Jared feather he's two things my actual
son and an IED Pro bodybuilder an expert
coach Mr janicki here we called him up
he was like you guys want me to do what
train legs now hell no I don't want that
smoke I don't want that beef I'm not
baking that cake and we're like all
right fine pick some muscle
group that you're mad enough to
train with us and he was like chest and
triceps JK his legs are so sore so we're
going to catch him on that one day or
another look at them shits holy crap
that's like my daddy and my granddaddy
on the same leg in any case let's see
that third leg big
homie I don't know if your lens is small
enough the zoom we need the telescopic
out for that I'm no stranger to
that folks chest and triceps all the
same workout we're going to have this
gentleman more swoll than already which
is even possible how I don't know one
two three te uh yeah team get team huge
yeah yeah yeah good stuff Mike all right
folks first exercise is incline barbell
press we're going to have tons of cues
on a slow Ecentric on a pause and
keeping an upright posture and exposing
the chest we're going to have probably
three sets here working sets for plenty
of warm-ups lots of time for Eric to
learn our queuing system Mr Jared at the
helm let's get it done you know how much
energy we have in the workout today
we're out here Bing see watch
this you ain't never seen some like
that sorry Bradley Martin I didn't mean
to break the gym I had a lot questions
about hand positioning what like do you
guys have like a specific like thing
that's right or is it more just like
what feels first and foremost what does
not hurt like what feels really good uh
second of all hand positions can
potentially Target different muscles
better so where you're at is a really
good chest emphasize barbell incline
press this is where I feel probably the
most chest right about here for me
personally great here I'm getting still
a lot of chest I mean it's just
obviously going to decapitate me
yeah I just top of the clavical is great
you can flare the elbows even a lot of
people say you should tuck the elbows
and everything on this as long as you're
controlling the Ecentric soft pausing on
the chest and you're not doing anything
nuts the injury risk is pretty
low excellent beautiful before you lie
down sit up really quick take your hands
out like this slide your scaps back
that's how you
press you're chucking your ring your ass
towards each other
[Music]
y big
chest you crazy
[Music]
 this guy's moving it laterally
down there and like it's 100
PBS how much rest until you feel ready
to go basically until the target muscle
feels like it's going to be the limiting
factor in the exercise and not like your
cardio vascular system or any assistant
muscular usually like two to 3 minutes
for
me
big
chest good big
chest good another one just touch right
to that middle chest point and come back
up nice and slow
easy Big
Move press press press
hold
up way to
control hold
up one more
slow slow wait Big
[Music]
Move Jesus Christ what a fcking
freak God
damn all right 225 for one final set
cool so I saw you do this thing at the
bottom of rep number six or five where
you went to your chest your your neck
and back what was that all about so it's
something I do a lot in my training
especially with chest when I find that
stretch position as we know the most
hypertrophic position is in that stretch
position so if I can kind of give myself
different stimulus in the bottom and
keep my tissue really long and healthy
because I don't do it's very well known
I don't do almost any Mobility work no
stretching outside of my lifts I use my
lifting as an opportunity to keep my
tissue as healthy as possible so if I
can sit in that stretch position and be
comfortable enough to take 275 and roll
it up to my neck and back down to my
chest that to me is showing myself that
it's very I could take that tissue and
use it athletically outside of the gym
and not slip walking my dog and tear my
chest cuz it's so tight you know what I
mean so that's the thought process okay
got it that used to be a position for me
that was the most painful now see it's
like a happy place that's awesome so
like when I do my flies like machine
flies I'll sit back there really opened
up even with the whole stack 300 lbs
I'll sit back there in that stretch
position it feels so good to me now but
some extreme ranges of motion at high
loads in a slow Ecentric is like almost
therapy it's like prehab sort of if
prehab was a real thing yeah of course
uh developing resiliency personally I
think your chest as much as let's say
you train like this you get super
comfortable here here here here here
under load it's just going to yeah I me
you skro extreme version of what we
normally do anyway like we try to find
the deepest position possible go down to
that position and then come back up so
this is literally flexibility training
as well at its best and you're just
adding a little bit to that
[Music]
so yep slow big chest yes just like that
look at that stretch going
[Music]
crazy go go go go lock it there you
good good stuff good god he's cooked I'm
cooked all right second exercise flat
dumbbell press you're going to notice a
ton of queuing for a big open stretch a
deep position a nice pause at the bottom
Eric is
295 lbs strong as he's going to be
using like the 80s 85s 90s 95s something
very light quote unquote because he's
doing it properly so whatever weight
you're doing at home rethink your weight
by getting your Technique first and then
seeing what weight matches rep ranges
have 10 or 15 uh reps here a few sets
let's get into
it open open open big chest there you go
deep stretch
deeper good again
[Music]
yep
[Music]
go go
go
[Music]
W that may be the hardest eight reps of
85 lbs anyone's ever flat pressed that's
like the most taking the weight and
making it feel hard I've ever seen yeah
that's uh that's my motto but yeah I
felt taxing for sure aren't you worried
about people looking at you and figuring
out that you're weak and then sarily
bullying you after you leave the gym
100% like hey little why don't you
give me your wallet since I know you
can't bench them even the '90s all the
time honestly I think that was something
I used to worry about a lot and then I
realized it's getting bigger than
everybody
accurate very accurate what's really
changed is my training style sure and
that's really help me well my physique
sure oh yeah and with no injuries yeah a
lot of times guys will say when they
getting bigger and stronger they kind
start fearing injury because they're
like well I have to train like an
explosive idiot and then if I do that
with 600 lb it's almost certainly going
to hurt me if 500 didn't but with
you as you're getting bigger and
stronger you're getting so much more
included on your Technique that the
relative risk of injury may actually be
going down this entire time
[Music]
yeah open open
yep
beautiful big
chest open up
[Music]
yes
big
[Music]
chest
finish as if
another all the way down control it big
chest control control hold for five 4
3 2 1

off good
[Music]
 ow dude you guys got that Ecentric
you got that extra
Ecentric you guys got that pause at the
bottom he's got an extra pause at the
bottom for y'all
mother don't even try to play with Mr
janicki oh that was brutal so good
excellent so let's get rid of this and
go do push Downs do it tricep sound
really good about your but now all right
folks third exercise tricep time we're
going to do push Downs very good
technique here full range of motion
control Ecentric but a little bit
quicker and Eric is going to do a a
giant myor rep set it's a giant set done
with myor rep so we have a certain
number of reps to do that's 80 he's
going to start with something like 20
reps very close to failure 5 or 10
seconds of rest he's back at it again
and again and again until he gets 80
reps this is going to be brutal I am
glad I'm not him try this at home if you
like to have fun yeah why not all right
good technique begins
[Music]

Eric jiki teleports in out ofing nowhere

kill you if you don't do it Mr jiki oh
good oh my God then someone reaches into
my you like you want you want a
deeper pocket you little fu
folks I'm going to tell you a story
about how dips got their name but before
that I'm going to tell you that we're
going to be doing three sets of dips
straight sets plenty of rest Eric's
triceps are essentially gone they're
pre- exhausted 80 total repetitions of
push Downs are dead because he is such a
technici he is going to stay upright
he's going to get his elbows really far
back behind him and then he is going to
get Ultra deep this is a crazy sh of us
to 295b man doing dips after tricep work
ising unheard of this is unreal
everything is false here technique
everything this guy's a spear animal
three sets and then at the end we might
have a little bonus round for him don't
tell him little intensifier technique
what else going to say oh uh yeah H out

[Music]
down up to
lockout
finish JK to the knees Bend those elbows
yep yes
control
finish that's it just roll out of
it talk that now Eric you little
 folks that is the
workout I got to tell you something Mr
janicki many people no most people
almost all people when they get closer
to failure and shest starts to hurt
their technique gets worse yours gets
better and it's one of the freakiest
things I've ever seen and that's really
an exaggeration of gets better because
it's so goddamn good to begin with
there's just not much that it can get
better but it still does somehow some
weird happened in your brain the
hamster was wrong running the wrong way
on the wheel and it's when you get in
trouble you regress back to better
technique what aing habit Jared what do
you think about that I think it's
amazing is basically everything we
preach you know leaning into the pain
you just got that nailed down completely
it's awesome I love to see it
this is actually
training hardcore this is actually
hardore I don't want to be presumptuous
and assume you learn anything at all
from us about how we train but the way
you train is how we train with your own
little twist I love the Twist and the
fundamentals are soing Rock Solid I was
recording your video about the exercise
scientist uh where like
critiques and I really had like three
critiques the whole time and the rest
was like damn this guy's theing man so
so huge huge respect to you Mega Kudos
and I wouldn't just be saying that if
you had 23 in charms any other way
although that was quite intimidating I
must say we've trained other folks with
big arms and don't train like this
that's all I'm going to say all right
what do you think about all that yeah no
honestly like first and foremost thank
you guys so much for having me yes you
were a huge inspiration I think a lot of
things I've been doing over time I
didn't really know how to explain them
scientifically so watching your guys
stuff has helped me so much in
understanding better my own the way I
train um but I think think that's the
biggest thing I want to show you guys is
that just because we're not lifting the
whole weight in the gym by sinking into
those reps the ones that sucked so bad
like I did not want to do any of those
last reps but because I split that
switch and I'm like okay this is
intensity this is where I'm going to
grow not those first four three or four
reps it's these last one to two that
crazy stretch I have to lean into that
if you can lean into that and look at
that as intensity that's going to
accelerate your training to the nth
degree because now you're focusing more
on how you're performing the movements
as opposed to how much weight you're
moving from A to B so yes appreciate it
yes and then last thing I'll say and
I'll speak for all of us here please
correct me if I'm wrong if all if all of
us are in some gym you come to our gym
we're traveling we go to your gym the
way we judge you CU we watch other
people train we judge them in our heads
we all do that if you have excellent
technique and you're pushing it hard we
got mad respect for you and you're doing
it right we don't give a how much we've
been around we've seen big strong guys
we're big strong guys who gives a flying
if you push whatever weight you're
pushing hard as with excellent technique
you have our infinite respect if you're
pretty strong and you're doing some dumb
 we you're just like whatever it's a
Tuesday I've seen that before yeah
100% yeah yeah know so wherever you are
on your own training Journey focus on
excellent technique focus on controlling
the weight focus on pushing each set
very very hard with that good technique
and you're going to be Wilding your way
you might look like Eric tomorrow yeah
