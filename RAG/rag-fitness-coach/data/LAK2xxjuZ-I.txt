hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and it turns out that you
can become healthier if you just replace
your awful chemical diet soda with
regular soda remember the kind mom and
pop used to drink you little rascal you
you were running around on the porch or
just your diapers mom and dad were
sucking down Coca-Cola Classics that's
right from the glass bottle
that um
it would never hurt the seagulls you
know the plastic bottles for the
seagulls the last bottles of Seagulls
would actually break and stab each other
with controlling the seagull population
through internacine seagull gang
violence it was good old days they are
good for reason and regular soda was
great diet soda is bad and if you
replace your stupid chemical corporate
illusion diet soda with regular soda
you'd be off to a better start oh wait
that's all fucking bullshit every last
word of it I know even the idea that
seagulls stab each other with broken
bottles of Coca-Cola classic
I sure wish that part was true didn't
that seem sweet they could have sideways
baseball hats and bandanas and glasses
and they'd be like no wait wait
top hats zoot suits
mashy squawk man and the other seagulls
like
some
Scott's video guy What's that show you
watch peaky blinders boy you like
fucking seagull are you
what accent was that the world would
never know generally British that's what
it was all right so here's the deal
regular soda and diet soda are roughly
equivalent on the degree of hydration
they provide
kill you to know that they have a
similar amount of water each and acidity
yeah so very similar between the two
yeah because you know that can cause
some health stuff it doesn't but people
think it does and then a carbonation
effects which you know can affect dental
health and stuff like that so it's all
the same the only difference is one has
real sugar and one has artificial sugar
artificial sweetener and here are some
downsides of artificial sweeteners
nope I don't hear shit either a few
crickets definitely oh wait one of the
Crickets said
that one series of studies that showed
that Stevia the natural artificial
sweetener is not so great for your gut
microbiome yep that's it
all right those are the predictable
General high-level bad effects of
artificial sweeteners basically just
don't exist
right super super low downsides
what are the downsides of sugar
calories sugar is lots of them and if
you drink lots of sodas the sugar brings
you lots of calories potentially making
you fatter if you don't control the rest
of your diet but also it brings you a
lot of sugar calories Without Really
reducing your appetite much because like
nobody ever drinks a Coke when they're
hungry and gets full that's a nonsense
statement and also of course uh worst
tooth stuff because artificial
sweeteners are not nearly as bad for
your teeth maybe not at all as are
actual sugars which are not ideal for
your teeth
99.99 of the time
the only reason that people say diet
soda is worse than regular soda is the
argument from nature fallacy
it is an official logical fallacy that's
in dictionaries and stuff thinking that
because something is natural it is
better
and there's something artificial that is
bad
so the next time you have a really nasty
upper respiratory tract bacterial
infection you can instead of taking an
antibiotic prove us all right and
get a snake to bite you instead
that's natural though you'll be fine at
some point
yes
I know what you're thinking Dr Mike you
fucking asshole I'm gonna write a 1500
page long comment about the nuanced ways
in which some people do not respond well
to various parts of artificial
sweeteners or diet soda or whatever and
yes some nuanced distinctions make valid
points in a 0.01 percent of all cases
whereas for that person regular soda is
actually marginally better than diet
soda but almost always
saying that regular soda is better than
diet soda is fucking bullshit notice
what I never said in this video
I never said that diet soda was better
than regular soda if you have a calorie
controlled diet and you're otherwise
healthy you can drink tons of regular
soda to your heart's content as long as
your dentist can look at the fucking
sight of you
probably especially your teeth
you guys ever think dentists work with
some people and they have another client
coming in or patient and look at who it
is and they're like God damn it that
person's just awful looking and they
have to work on your ugly ass every time
I go to the dentist my teeth are all
fucked up I wonder if they're judging me
of course they're fucking judge me what
else do you think they do you listen to
Smooth Jazz all day and fuck with
people's teeth something's got to be
going on up there
if my dentist sees this please do not
strap me to the chair and do that shit
they did in the movie This is called
Scott the dentist
horror movie
it's terrible don't ever watch it I have
never actually seen it but I've seen
previews and that was enough
right
if you want to control your calories and
still get all the same experiences more
or less a regular soda diet's great if
your calories under control and you like
the taste of Coca-Cola classic and who
can say no
then all as well but the idea that if
you're drinking diet soda and someone
says hey you should be regular because
diet soda is poison well
what they should be drinking is a whole
big fucking can of
bullshit that's right even Arnold said
it this time see you guys next time
