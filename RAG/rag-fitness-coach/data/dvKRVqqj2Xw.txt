folks welcome back weekly webinar dr
james dr mike
answering your ridiculous and sometimes
great youtube questions dr mike how's it
going
good good how are you james i'm doing
okay
uh apologies in advance folks i might
have to pass my phone off midway through
the webinar we're having like a
little bit of a gas leak and the
person's going to come out and fix it so
i might bug out for like two seconds
apologies in advance other than that i'm
good uh the
the one dog got neutered so he's a bit
of a cone head
right now he's not super happy about the
cone situation
um but he's good he's good he got
snipped
when just like the other one gets paid
uh
a little bit later on they so when you
have when they're
when they're brother and sister you have
to get it done earlier than normal not
like
way early but just a slight on the early
side of normal just so you don't have
any accidents
but the spay is is more involved because
they have to cut her open watch you
deeper and there's much more interest
stuff
so they did they do the boys first
because it's a real quick
thing for the for the boy dogs and uh
less less crazy so
she'll be next she's on the chopping
block
yeah all right but first up is darren
hawkins
oh boy oh right there
yeah all right front and center so
darren hawkins
asks you've mentioned that close grip
bench isn't a great tricep builder what
about the overhead press or is the dip
the only compound lift
thanks mike and james the dip is not the
only compound lift there's tons of
others for example the jm press and its
variations
is compound uh and that's great tricep
builder
but the overhead press can be a tricep
builder
that's decent but usually it's not great
but darren you can actually answer that
question for yourself and someone could
everyone else viewing
by assessing your stimulus to fatigue
ratio in the deadlift
um we're sorry in the overhead press uh
you know i was like wait that's the only
one where it wouldn't count
yeah exactly so basically you do
overhead presses and
are your triceps getting uh tons of
tension through them are they getting a
burnt higher reps
are they getting pumped and are they
getting uh like super weak and
sore afterwards and if the answer is
like no that's really just my front
belts
then the answer is it's not a great
tricep builder relative to the front
belt
so sometimes it can turn into a great
tricep builder
if you pre-exhaust with some overhead
extensions or some uh
some cable push-downs and then all of a
sudden doing right after that
doing overhead press the triceps become
a limiting factor but under most
conditions for most people
the answer is not really but it really
just uh depends try yourself
and the same thing applies to close per
bench some people get a ton out of their
triceps close group benching most people
don't get
that much yeah and just to touch that
one up a little bit
uh darren i think if i remember what we
talked about last time we were mostly
just saying that uh the close grip bench
is
is a chest movement fundamentally right
like can you get some more
tricep work in there by adjusting your
grip sure but like fundamentally it's
still a chest
movement and then the triceps would be
an assistance so ultimately
in those situations like um anything
that's not direct
directly training the muscle will always
be subpar compared to things where that
that particular muscle is an accessory
so any of the pressing movements
overhead pressing bench pressing it's
always an accessory
kind of part of the movement whereas the
chest or the delts are going to be the
big emphasis
of those movements so for example if
your goal is to build big strong triceps
like you probably would get more out of
a tricep
push down than a close grip bench in
many cases if you're kind of more of
like an intermediate athlete and beyond
beginners get a ton out of everything so
it's kind of one of those things where
you might have a buddy who
started his fitness journey with doing
close grip bench presses and he got big
arms from doing that well that's great a
lot of people experience that same thing
but at some point you'll have to move on
to more direct training and that's just
how it goes sometimes the
compounds just don't you just can't do
enough at some point to get the stimulus
that you need for the arms
next up bastian angerly
what the fuck all right we're going
control
f we've learned boss john gotcha
james this one's all you hi docs i want
to increase my spiking power in
volleyball
even though i've seen rp's move into
anatomy video on the shoulder i'm still
100 certain with my approach
so my question is what muscles are
involved in a powerful spike and what
exercise would you recommend for
training i will say i was a support
scientist for volleyball for many years
my best answer is the triceps
the pectorals the lats
and the serratus anterior and abdominal
muscles uh as well as hip flexors
are a good start james where did i air i
know i think that's great so the thing
is this is one of those you might be
doing a paralysis by analysis situation
where you're like well how do i
get strong at this one particular
movement which like of the rotator cuff
muscles because you think about a
volleyball spike right there's kind of
like that cocking phase where you're
pulling back
you get that amortization that reflexing
whip as you come through to hit it
but ultimately kind of the the main
action is that kind of shoulder
extension downward and then kind of
back towards that internal rotation so
you could spend a lot of time
strengthening like the internal and
external rotators of the shoulders a la
uh over the top but you turn your
fucking hat backwards get in that truck
and you work that machine all day you're
going to spike the fucking wall
are you though the reality is is that
you're going to get plenty of that
work for those muscles doing a lot of
the other uh
big movements like your presses and your
pulse so mike already highlighted the
muscles which i agree with i think are
probably the most important especially
anything that's going to do that kind of
shoulder extension pulling the arm down
so your lats is part of your pecs like
your red eye
any of those kind of scapular movers are
going to be really good well how do you
make those really strong well turns out
you do the same shit that you always do
you do strong
pressing and pulling movements and turns
out that's a great
way of indirectly training a lot of the
rotator cuff muscles and stuff anyway
so you approach that largely you the
same way as you would approach just
developing a strong upper body for
volleyball
and most of the explosiveness and power
you're going to generate in that
movement
will come from you practicing your spike
technique and just slowly getting
stronger
over time so kind of the the tldr is
get strong and get good and that
normally works itself out
if you spend a lot of time trying to
perseverate and do the most nitpicky of
the muscles in the shoulder joint and
the shoulder girdle to try and increase
your spiking power
you're probably wasting your time
whereas if you develop a strong either
press or overhead press
you get pretty good at doing like rows
and pull-ups and you maintain relatively
good shoulder health
man you're you're right there
[Music]
that is a very good answer
next up is
mike
it's just one mic oh your name is mike
control f no okay my canis
that's not it uh i could you don't even
have to pull it off because it's so
short i can just
read it okay i'll try and find it in the
meantime oh i found it
there's mike okay oh a lot 41
uh likes very nice yeah what hypertrophy
study would you do
if uh you didn't have to consider ethics
and you had none
so you had no difference you had no you
had no personal ethics that you had to
confront in addition to like
institutional ethics
yeah i think i actually uh i i can
answer this question uh that's pretty
good quite easily i would
if i had no ethics i had no ethics
some say you don't you're right
i would take a huge swath of the west
african population
and do a multi-generational forced
interbreeding program
whereby we selected the most elite
hypertrophy genetics
multiplied over 20 generations
the runts would be ronnie coleman
uh and the elite would be something that
is wildly unprecedented there you go
you asked i answered so youtube mike not
mike isratel
you know that that was gonna go like
some kind of weird eugenics type route
right you know that that's the answer to
that
and there's no other way no ethics um
i maybe i'll go a different non-eugenics
route and say
uh like when we have kind of um
the artificial intelligence revolution
where we have
like basically ghost in the shell type
era stuff where people are just living
with
you know all sorts of artificial
enhancements that's what i want to see
um so what kind of experiment would that
be i don't know
fucking hook somebody up to a terminator
and see if they're good at basketball
that'd be cool
yeah who knows there you go
next up
is that f yep there we go ireland
there's a jiu jitsu fighter named theon
davies
there you go oh it's a woman right yep
isn't her name two two f's at the
beginning
is it i don't know it's too much i just
call her on
because why would you have two apps if
you didn't want me to say that
all right so theon depending on how you
say his name
says hello dr swallow algae greetings
from iceland tax of uh land of tax
loopholes that keeps your country rich
by the way
and lockdown to electric boogaloo number
one uh
question is okay so we we're sticking to
the one question here
uh one question is about training
experience and good grasps one is about
body fat percent
judging uh james which one do you should
we answer
um i'm tired of answering body fat
judging related questions number one is
a good question they're both good so
uh number one i have a few years of
training experience and feel as if i
have a good rest of the basics of
hypertrophy training
ultimately i like to train others and
i've started to train my teenage brother
obviously complete beginner
what are the things i should pay special
attention to in order to maximize my
understanding the process of getting
jacked
rate of progress and the issues they run
into rate of progress is not something
you pay attention to a lot actually
because it's so
influenced by genetics and training age
i don't know if it's going to tell you
much
definitely pay attention to issues they
run into pay attention especially to the
development of their technique
make sure you are a stickler for good
technique gently nudge them
into technique make sure they're not
lifting any more weight until their
technique is at least stable and
improving
that is huge also pay a lot of attention
to
their sra dynamics stimulus recovery
adaptation
when they are getting uh muscle sore and
retired
when does that muscle that group of
muscles recover again because then you
can adjust the frequency
and the volume really well to them the
last thing i'll say
is pay attention to their sfr indicators
how much of a pump
and a burn and tension and uh
weakness in the local muscle and
soreness they're getting from various
exercises various techniques
versus how much systemic fatigue they're
getting and
uh how much joint connected to fatigue
they're getting and the rating of
perceived exertion
because some exercises some ways of
training some rep ranges
some techniques are going to be much
better than others and you can slowly
tailor the training to them and discover
how their body works so that you can
train them the best way possible genes
yeah that was really good just for the
sake of discussion i might go a
different route so um
if you're working with people like so he
says you're starting to train your
teenage brother who's a beginner
now granted i know that that the
question was more general this is the
call sorry i gotta run i'm so sorry i'll
be right back
yep oh sorry about that
oh okay sorry can i uh did you want me
to still answer
yeah okay yeah so um i know the question
was more
broadly sweeping than just working with
the beginner but just to kind of
just food for thought maybe go a
different direction than dr mike
sometimes it's good to not
uh make things overly complicated for
beginners and if that's mainly who
you're going to be working with at least
in the beginning
you might kind of glaze over things like
sfr
so that they're not overly because i've
seen it go the other direction where
you can get the paralysis by analysis
and the good thing with beginners is
as long as their technique is good and
the loads are controlled and their
efforts are controlled
they're going to reap huge huge huge
benefits and sometimes it makes things
needlessly complicated when you ask them
a bunch of questions which they barely
understand yet like
how's that pump that you got they're
like i don't know i've never really done
this before
fair enough right and so with um and i
know this is like specific to beginners
and i know maybe your question wasn't
about all about beginners but in a lot
of cases they are when people come to
you for help they're
largely noobs so what i would say is
as dr mike said earlier focus on the
technique and getting the basics things
like
their relative effort how dialed in are
they to their maximal or
close to their maximal abilities are
they able to reproduce the technique
under those different relative ability
constraints right like can they keep
their technique
when they're putting in a 90 effort on a
set or something like that
but i think those are the things that
will carry them a really really long way
and then as we've kind of outlined in
this is all god it's shameless plug
sorry
i've i finished my pass on the
hypertrophy book so it's on
it's off the top of my mind right so uh
we actually outline a lot of these
things in the hypertrophy book where we
say when you have beginners
thanks mel um don't worry about
the complicated shit worry about
technique as you move into your
intermediate stages
start thinking more about things like
your volume landmarks getting those
things dialed in and as you get more
advanced start thinking about right like
sfr mind muscle connection
more advanced training things as the
trainer you have to be able to identify
what client populations you're working
with and kind of work your way into
those things
and not making it needlessly complicated
for your clients so know who you're
working with
identify kind of what their training age
is and be able to outline some realistic
session to session goals
based on their training age right so if
you have more intermediate clients then
you're thinking a little bit more about
like sfr volume landmark stuff if you've
got complete beginners you're really
just thinking about getting them
a base of technique that will carry them
out through the rest of their career
if you're working with advanced people
yeah you got to know every single
exercise every single rep range which is
the best for that particular individual
and it's complicated but luckily
they should know most of that stuff
already um
next up and he asked two questions that
made it in
today because they were so highly
upvoted god damn is
ein e-i-n brown
and it's the i think i've gotten a
little confused question
okay i can't look at the name iron and
not think cowboy bebop
fuck the corgi right that's right and uh
bitch with the wait oh we had two
questions fuck
this is the wrong one
let's find the other one there we go
got it all right i think i've gotten a
little confused about central nervous
system fatigue and systemic fatigue cns
fatigue always a global fatigue
affecting our muscles no
the central nervous system fatigue can
actually be to
the part of the motor cortex and all of
the nerves that only affect one muscle
so no cns fatigue does not have to be
global it can be specific
uh and does it accumulate across a
mesocycle or is it more short-lived it
absolutely accumulates across the
mesocycle
chris beardsley writes that under normal
non-pathological circumstances any
reductions of strength that lasts more
than 24 hours
must be caused by muscle damage that's
wrong chris beardly can't prove that
chris bursley says a lot of shit
that he takes out of one study an
undergraduate and
sorry i was going to be real nice but
she was a bit no i
i agree just so you guys don't think dr
mike's being
rough got a lot of good stuff that he
says but sometimes he makes like really
insane blanket statements that are just
by no means clear to anyone else reading
the literature
um and this is something that you can
look up and sorry for kind of tangenting
but this is uh you can look at the
um ice bath stuff look at the research
on ice bath
they find that you can return to
performance
more quickly with the ice bath and they
largely attribute that to
nervous system changes yeah and almost
no tissue change
yeah so does that mean mrv is dictated
by accumulation of muscle damage it is
in part it is part of the picture
um does accumulated muscle damage result
in spillover fatigue that affects
performance in other muscle groups yes
it does
in many ways one of which is the
cytokine hypothesis
muscle damage essentially allows various
some of them are hormones some of them
are other substances leak into
increased concentration in the
bloodstream and a high level of these
hormone or of these substances in the
bloodstream
signals various other parts of your body
including your brain
uh to experience fatigue because it's
basically like a global indicator of
damage
so and you can tell like if you really
trained legs hard and your legs got
super sore
you're not a hundred percent in your
mental game on your chest or on your
back or something like that
especially if lots of your body's sore
it really does
add up so muscle damage is a component
of of
local fatigue and systemic central
nervous system fatigue
can be systemic in nature and it can be
local in nature
so it's a little bit of a complex puzzle
and it's not just
uh just one thing or another yeah
totally agree and
you guys can think of this in another
silly way in that when you are dieting
and you start getting weird food
cravings right
so if you've been dieting for a while
you might be like man like i just have a
hankering for some peanut butter or
for something else right is it because
you desperately want peanut butter no
it's because there's a variety of
cacophony of
chemical signals in the body going i
have more
uh reactants than uh or excuse me i have
more products than reactants right now
this is kind of fucked up
we need to start skinning some
subconscious signals up top to the
conscious guy
that he needs to eat things things like
fats and fats
peanut butter is just one of those fats
you typically have around the house so
you want some peanut butter right same
thing goes with um in the other
direction kind of with like the muscle
damage and fatigue right when you
accumulate a lot of muscle damage
especially if you're training your whole
body
you start to have these cellular signals
going around and they start to have
subconscious or unconscious effects
which eventually start translating into
conscious effects
like the manifestations of what we would
call fatigue
so same idea excellent
excellent stuff um
next up is alejandro mayofret
holy spicy that's a-l-e-j
got it he's got andro writing his name
he's already jacked
and mayo that's true god damn this is
the most muscular human of all time
how should you count protein coming from
non-complete vegetarian sources
for example bread rice pasta in the rpe
uh
book in the section regarding pdcaas
their punctuation is like 0.5 to 1. so
does that mean that we should count half
the protein content they have thanks a
lot docs actually there are three
ways you can go with this and i'd
probably use just one of the three ways
and stick to it it doesn't really matter
which one you use you just have to have
a couple caveats
one you can count them as zero protein
because some of them are quite
low on the effect and
you just count their protein calories
into the carbohydrate column
okay uh you could do that and that's
totally fine
um uh so so that's that or you could
just count their calories in a just
calorie column so that your calories are
not
the summation directly of your proteins
carbs and fats kind of like you would
count alcohol
that's totally fine to do uh the second
one
is you can do a fraction count where you
count them for about half
right uh you could count from two thirds
a quarter you could have dive deep into
the literature pointlessly to see which
one is best depending on the food
but on average you can count one for
half and that's fine so for example
feeding bread
uh and it's got you know 10 slices of
bread that you're eating like the
micasmatel diet
and each slice has a gram of protein you
can say that those 10 slices of bread
contribute uh five grams of protein and
the others you just count as carbs or
just count as calories four grams per
uh four calories per gram and not
labeled
okay uh lastly you can just count all of
them as exact protein sources one to one
okay every single one
you know that 10 10 grams of protein
comes from 10 grams of bread in that
case
but for that last one you have to make
sure
that the majority and i will say
75 of your proteins
are coming from very high value complete
protein sources
because if you do count them one to one
especially if you're eating a lot of
vegetarian sources especially
if you're vegan or vegetarian you get in
a situation where the vast majority
if not all of your protein comes from
very shady sources and then
you think you're eating 200 grams of
protein a day but the real oomph of that
is like
50 to 100 grams of protein per day as
far as effect
so on anabolism and so on and so forth
so
if you eat the vast majority if you're
eating like multiple chicken breasts a
day and whey protein
can you count the other shade of protein
yes is there one better method than the
other uh not necessarily
uh but uh those are the three methods
just know that with the first method
uh you are can have any kind of protein
source
you want because you're only counting
the complete ones in the second method
it's a decent one it's sort of what's it
50 50. it's probably the most truthful
one as far as
uh deep logic is concerned but it does
require you to count things in half and
count the other half as calories blah
blah
and then the last method is the simplest
um you just count them as you just fuck
on them and that's the easiest one to
put into like trackers
uh like for example uh my fitness pal
and stuff like that because they don't
they don't fraction out for you and they
never will
or probably never will uh but uh
that uh you know so that's the simplest
one but then you have to make sure
you're eating
you know good high quality protein
sources for most of your diet
and you're not doing this thing where
you tell people you eat four grams of
protein a day but it's really a shitload
of rice bread pasta and actually breast
or something like that uh and uh some
sometimes these ancillary sources add up
to where like oh my god my proteins
here's the people get in trouble they
say they can eat 200 grams of protein a
day
and then they start putting my fitness
pal in everything and they get up to 200
grams of protein with only one chicken
breast and one egg
because they like ate so much rice and
possibly like i can't eat any more
protein this is crazy
that's a mistake and that's something
needs to be rectified oh my god i'm
getting
i'm getting my ptsd from coaching is
getting triggered right now oh yeah i'm
sure this is
this is a real exact problem that mike
was describing um but the good news here
is
that uh for the most part you can't
really fuck this up too bad
as long as you do this consistently over
time the only way that at least that i
can see that you can really fuck this up
hold my beard oh um is
a if you're not keeping track of your
body weight right so that's just like a
total
noob error first off because then your
calories could be all over the place who
knows
um but really is if you're just not if
you're doing that third option
and you are just constantly way under on
the protein if you're trying to be a
jack person and you're just way under on
the quality on the protein
that's really the only situation where
you can really do a bad job with this
if you're doing one of the first option
or the second option or some kind of in
between
as long as you're doing it consistently
and you're doing the very basic things
like
having a rough idea of your calories
tracking your body weight and do and
counting all these things in the same
way
it largely works itself out over time so
long as you don't find yourself in the
trap of that third option
where you've been chronically under
eating protein for way too long that's
really the only at least
and i must talk dr mike you can think of
anything else that's the only way i see
people fucking this up yeah just getting
into
the the numbers are all that matter
starting to eat a lot of their little
favorite foods and then
protein comes mostly from pop-tarts and
you're
you're just guys the bodybuilding core
diet works really well
because it works logically plenty of
meat
eggs fish great high quality vegan
protein sources that's what fucking
builds muscle because it's high value
protein
so if you think you've hacked dieting
you could eat only pizza crust
and get jacked you know then
you may not have packed what you think
you have
that's like the barn dog diet old pizza
exactly
yeah just like eating pizza boxes you
know you're trying to
have protein pizza flavored boxes yeah
all right so very very good question
there who's up next again it's ein brown
oh the second round brown question
second question
oh i'm back on the first very very good
question
my impression is that within a single
session there are diminishing returns
in how much additional stimulus you get
for each additional set above minimum
effective volume
in other words i'm wondering if one were
to do 90 percent of the usual volume
every month say by slowing down weekly
progression or sub progression
this would this generate something like
95 percent
of the stimulus and not 90 percent of
the stimulus
so sorry can i nip something in the butt
here really quick
within a single session there are
diminishing returns and how much
additional stimulus you get for each
additional set above
mev no so there's a huge range of
above emi from mev and beyond where
adding sets can be beneficial but there
is a point at which that does become
problematic right and that's usually
what we would call
in the dose response relationship well
we would call that like the session mrv
for whatever muscle group
that you were training at that point but
um
adding sets above mev is actually a good
idea in many cases maybe not all cases
but definitely in many cases
so the first set above mev gives you the
biggest difference from no growth to
growth
the second set you add gives you a huge
difference but a smaller
relative change though absolutely it's
still added and i think that's what he
meant he's saying
per set each additional set is less
stimulative but they summate that's the
issue so i don't know
sure if that was a phrasing for sure
it's not like 90
so so we'll get to that in a sec if you
were to do 90
of the usual volume every month say by
slowing down weekly
uh percent progression would this
generate something like ninety-five
percent of us they may listen at ninety
yes probably that's probably true
let's keep going if so that means one
get a higher stimulus per time
investment or stimulus percent
if one is willing to forego a higher
stimulus per month yes also true
which seems appealing if you have modest
goals for one muscle group or for your
physique in general
totally and this is something that when
we get into the more technical lectures
that are going to come out on youtube
over the next several years as we have
lectures
written and planned out for that long
and oh fuck we get into this big time in
the hypertrophy book
we actually have a list of
recommendations in a hypertrophy book
uh which is coming out in about a month
by the way of
like if you are not
if you are looking for the best stimulus
to time ratio
like you you don't have a lot of time in
the gym what do you do do not drive the
volumes really high because
that's for the optimality people that
want everything out of it
that's not for the just do a good job
people just doing a good job
actually doesn't require that many sets
which is amazing
because you can get great gains training
it like
15 sets per week you get
better gains 20 cents per week for
example and just slightly better gains
with 25 cents
the thing is we always speak from
optimality first and then we regress
backwards
but we do address and we will address
the fact that you're completely correct
you can get
good good good results with way less
volume
because it's not one of those let's see
the light is either on or off it's not
like either i get perfect results or i
get no results that's absolutely not the
case
for most people especially beginners
especially those with modest goals
and then he says would mep volumes give
the maximum amount of stimulus per set
yes just over mev volumes would give the
max amount of stimulus per set that's
very true
if not are there perceptive indicators
to judge how much volume you would and i
think that
your answer is already correct is there
a quantitative rule of thumb like a
certain range of sets above
in v no we're aiming to end your meso a
certain percentage of the volume and
normal immediate mrv progression would
produce
no i think that if you go to the gym and
you're getting decent pumps and a little
bit of soreness and a little bit of swag
to your muscle
you're making really good gains and you
will continue to make good gains
until you don't make any gains at all
that against are getting shitty then you
have a question of
you know your 90 effort is no longer
good enough to get you
anywhere and then you have to make a
maximum effort it's kind of like this
you're launching rockets out of your
backyard with a bottle rocket launcher
very simple setup can get your rocket to
go 150 feet into the air
now if you want it to go 250 feet of the
air you're gonna have to invest like
quite a bit more time into it if you
want your rocket to go to the moon
you need a 10 trillion dollar space
program or whatever like
it's it's a huge escalating curve for
maximum performance
so know that and if you
with training age and with increasing
goals because here's the deal people say
like i just want the basics
and then they get to be 170 pounds and
pretty lean like well i still want to
gain like
but you're 175 and lean now anything
beyond this isn't the basics anymore
like well it is for me like no no
you are now more advanced for you to go
to 180 it will require
a big ass rocket some elon musk ship
and and that's just where you are so
know
that yes a very small stimulus will get
you pretty fucking
far but when it no longer doesn't
you need more and you will need more and
it's something to expect james
yeah that was a good explanation on that
because it's a complicated issue and
really it's kind of an issue of
trade-offs too it's you
you're basically saying like i want to
be more fit but i have
time constraints or i just can't commit
that much to this can i get like okay
gains doing a lot less yeah you can
uh if you want to get better than okay
gains then you have to assess the
trade-offs and say like can i add
another day per week can i add maybe 20
minutes per session you know those are
just things that you'll have to juggle
at some point and if you want to
keep getting more and more jacked over
time that level of commitment
unfortunately just has to keep
going up and there's there's not really
any way around it
i would also like to just highlight i
don't know if anyone else is noticing
this
i couldn't help myself look at jared's
fix your smith machine
technique what is he doing it's so funny
and i know it's meant to be wrong
which look at this it's so oh yeah we
tried
what is this well james that we've seen
this at like
games in vegas that was inspired by real
events
i believe you it's just really excludes
oh yeah he's hitting all sorts of stuff
god damn all right
next up look at fix your leg press this
guy he looks like he's doing okay
yeah that's that's an okay machine squat
oh no oh no what is happening that makes
you clear
for sure for sure it's just funny
all right montas pilipoches is our next
asker his name makes me think of like a
cosmic manta ray that comes down to
bestow wisdom upon you after you've
completed your journey
it's not wrong
so mantas asks a
very good question is it true that
fatigue accumulates if the training is
overloading
in my opinion the fatigue should drop to
almost zero on the rest days
in the first weeks of a mesocycle and uh
it should start to accumulate on linear
mrv so you actually a fatal conceit of
your question is you said the fatigue
should drop to almost zero
and that's zero itself if it drops to
almost zero it will accumulate
now are we ready to say that every
single bit
of overloading training in every
instance demonstrates a
real world cumulative fatigue not like
if you train like this for 80 years
eventually your fatigue community
no we're not for beginners training very
close to med
you may get weeks and months of training
that does not result in any measurable
cumulative fatigue
because your adaptations your ability to
recover and uh reduce fatigue
at some point are actually escalating
faster than you are overloading
if you are training like that the big
takeaway of how to interpret our
statements
on fatigue accumulates if your training
is overloading is
as you become more advanced and as you
become bigger and stronger
and in almost every realistic mesocycle
that you run that is progressively more
difficult or takes enough time to get
you good gains
fatigue accumulates if the training in
that context as a whole
is stimul it is uh
going to be a thing cumulative fatigue
will be a thing as long as that training
is overloaded
which is to say that if you are
intermediate or above
and if you're trying to make your best
gains if you are looking for a type of
training it is consistently
non-fatigue accumulative but still
progressive
and overloading and lets you get better
you are looking for something
that doesn't exist but for fleeting
moments
of exceptions to rules that's what we're
talking about
so that's why the cumulative fatigue
model is super super effective
if you're actually trying to do a good
job and you're a long longer raw
beginner
we're not just talking about maybe the
first week or first two of your training
cycle
if you're training in a real world
manner overloading training
will accumulate fatigue when you want to
do your best job
and you're not super new yes we are
saying that james
yeah and so like at montes your idea
works well in like a beginner model but
completely falls apart once you hit kind
of intermediate and above because you
say you know like all right
should drop almost dropped to zero on
the rest days well like how do you know
how many rest days to take
right like how where how do you know how
many training days to take at that well
james
sorry let me cut in real quick uh if you
take enough rest days
to get fatigued down to actually close
to zero you are no longer training in
any way that is close to optimal
because you're taking such breaks
between them oh i'm sorry
i'm sorry no no you you hit you're right
on the money so that's kind of the idea
right
where we're saying you know well well if
you have all these rest days well
beginners do that they only train three
or four times a week but you know as you
get more intermediate
it's very likely that you might have to
upgrade to four or five times a week and
as you get advanced maybe
five six or more sessions per week right
so at that point
where do those rest days come uh you're
bound
to hit periods of if not
overlapping uh sra curves very close to
overlapping sra curves and that's just
the nature of
training as you get more and more
advanced because you have to do more and
more
so beginners yes you don't have to do a
ton and they can drop a ton of fatigue
and still make great gains
but as your mev and mav characteristics
rise over time
it's almost impossible to get a robust
training stimulus without some residual
fatigue and that's just
i wish i could uh
what am i trying to say um so that's
very clearly outlined from the stimulus
perspective in the dose response
literature so i can say very confidently
uh from a stimulus perspective from the
science that is
the case i think from experience we also
know that if you are following that same
trend following the literature on what
it takes to create a good stimulus
and following our general
recommendations on training age in my
experience in my opinion
there's no possible way that if you are
starting an overloading mesocycle as an
intermediate or above
that you can drop to fatigue to baseline
levels it just never happens that way if
you can do that
that means you're not actually doing
overload training either on a daily or
weekly schedule
it's just it just doesn't happen
jordan herrera
not as spicy as i would prefer but okay
that's all right i love this question
because it lets us do a real
zinger answer oh no
i have to be today i made a goal of like
not being cunty so i have to
yeah you're doing okay so far
all right i'm working
jordan herrera says hi dr mike and dr
james thanks in advance
there are some muscle groups that i've
observed that appear to be able to
handle infinite volume for example my
lateral
ah i see where this is going no
reason why i say such things away
i do not get sore i feel the cunt
leaving
i do not get sore on these muscles uh or
many times a day
after working out such muscle there
feels like nothing happened
almost not attackable levels of
disruption i really feel like i'm taking
ces close to failure
in other words i'll do squats the next
day and i'll feel like i did something
to my quads but for lats and lateral
adults
it doesn't seem like i did that much on
l the next day i'm getting a pump and
suppose specific muscles however okay so
here's the deal
let's just go back to saying able to
handle infinite volume
uh not being cunty but you actually
haven't tested this hypothesis
um because you say i've observed
that up here to handle it be able to
handle infinite volume you actually
haven't observed that because you have
on a scale of zero to infinity your
volume has been awfully close to zero
maybe you're doing eight sets per
session hey there you know eight is it
closer to zero infinity
technically any number that's a shitty
scale that's that's
everything's always close to zero at
that point i know let's call infinity
okay fine fine let's do a shortcut let's
call infinity a trillion
how close is eight to infinity versus
zero real close
real close so uh and i know you didn't
really mean infinity
uh so a couple of things to your
absolute credit where you're correct
some muscles absolutely can handle more
volume than others and in part
is the way they're designed the way
they're inserted the way we can access
them with exercises is just not very
damaging
there's other reasons for it muscle
architecture can be different so on and
so forth
so that's absolutely the case uh however
you uh soreness is not the only
indicator of being able to handle volume
performance is absolutely the number one
indicators sore nuts or some point the
muscle just poops out on you
so what you can do is do more sets per
session
and to do more sessions per week so if
you train a muscle twice a week you can
say oh i can recover from whatever yeah
train that shit four times a week with
the same number of sets all of a sudden
by day number four you're like oh fuck
i'm getting weaker
like i can't lateral raise what i used
to ta-dah that muscle can't handle
volume you found its mrv
and all of a sudden you know where that
range ends and how to how to play it
at the end of the day there are some
muscles forearms biceps for some people
many people the side and rear delts for
some people interestingly the lats for
many people not
uh upper back for some people that
doesn't include the lats in this case
like rhomboids or so on and so forth
uh mid traps some people can actually
train them robustly that is to say
with three to ten sets per session six
days a week
right but very few people can train a
muscle
with 12 sets per session six days a week
that
you know what is that 72 sets is a
realistic cap for almost everyone right
and there are people that can get there
and
and a little bit beyond there are one in
a thousand type of people
you probably not one of them by that i
mean you're just probably not won a
thousand
it's just the case so try to do more
volume and especially more frequency
push your sets like you're already doing
close to fail watch your performance
it will plateau and then it will decline
that will be mrv and the infinite volume
is just higher volume
and look we're here with you it can be a
lot fucking higher surprisingly higher
way higher but it's not infinite all the
sport science
shit still holds true they're not
violating some kind of basic effect
it's still they have everything as mrv
some people like to put that more
quickly they'll say i feel like this so
and so and such and such
doesn't have an mrv bullshit walking has
an mrv
you can't walk a marathon every day if
you're the average person you walk 26.2
miles one day
and the next day your ankles hurt your
feet have blisters and then one week
later you're in the hospital you can't
walk for another week
mrv hit while walking it's all a matter
of how much
james yeah that was great um i i've i've
experienced this
the same thing with the delts the rear
delts and the the lats so i can give you
at least some personal insights on this
i think with a lot of those muscle
groups you have to know
okay so the the immediate the immediate
thing that we always say so
you hear my dr mike and i say this all
the time you gotta find good sfr
exercises
first and foremost so you're probably
picking exercises on those
particular muscle groups which just
aren't great for you and
or you're doing them in rep ranges which
aren't great so
both of those are sfr right so um the
other thing that i have found with those
muscle groups in particular so like the
lats
is one of those like if you're not doing
10 to 20
and you're like ah my lats are like i'm
doing six to ten and i can just do them
forever
do 10 to 20. right it's just one of
those muscle groups it seems to respond
a little bit better to higher reps at
least in my experience same with the
delts for the most part like if you're
doing sets of like eight on your fucking
delts get the fuck out of here
um what i also have found with the delts
is that they seem to benefit from using
intensification techniques like pauses
and
slow eccentrics so for example if you're
like man my rear delts i can just do
infinity well are you just doing like
bent over reverse flies
try doing a cable curl or excuse me a
cable face pull with a peak contraction
and like a four second
eccentric see if that makes a difference
right are you doing the same thing with
the lateral raises are you just like
lifting your arms up like okay we'll try
like a thumbs down
lateral raise where you peek hold and
then bring it down for a four count or
even an upright row
get those elbows way up high and then
actually four count on the way down
those are really really good for
developing the mind muscle connection
and i think really increases the sfr on
those particular movements
the lats is one in the back muscles in
general if you're like me and like many
other people you might actually be able
to train
back like four times per week split up
however you know
suits you um but i have found like in
the past where i would try to do a lot
of heavy
last step where i'd be doing you know
weighted pull-ups and stuff and i would
just never make any progress
and then i just got i just got my squat
rack i got the pulley
thing does that work pretty well
mike even for my lanky gumby ass i can
get
full top and bottom and i've had the
best
lap training i have ever had that i can
think of because i've been able to do
straight arm pulls right for a higher
rep range i've been able to do a variety
of pull downs and i can still do some
heavy stuff
either whether they're rows or heavier
pull up variations da
but on average you're probably going to
want to bias your lat training to a
higher frequency
say three to four times per week with
the majority of it being in that 10 to
20 rep range and it might even benefit
you to do some isolation stuff
sidebar on the straight arm pulls i just
discovered
how to ask that far myself into that
movement better because i for whatever
reason i just never had a lot of luck
because my triceps would burn out
always on the straight arm pulls what i
found is actually for myself and for all
you lanky people out there i hope this
is helpful
if you actually put yourself into a
posterior pelvic tilt which is the
poop dog position which normally is
contraindicated for basically everything
for whatever reason poop dogging allows
me to pull
my lats down much harder without my
triceps giving out
and i've actually gotten like crippling
lat soreness
from that movement which i never would
have had in my life so i changed my
technique a little bit
way over i was doing the same volumes
that i was doing before which was a
mistake
after changing my technique midway
through the meso cycle and then it
fucked me up really bad so don't do what
i did but
try poop dogging see if that helps
because it helped me a lot
very good stuff very good stuff all
right
last question for the day is abdul
rahman
khaled got it
all right hi docs in your recent video
muscle gain
periodization in the application part
you said that when you get to a high
percent body fat you may do a 10 week
fat loss phase
which can result in around five percent
body fat decrease
i know you showed it only as an example
but as i thought
if many cuts could be up to one percent
loss per week one percent weight loss
per week not pure fat loss per week
wouldn't a five week mini cut be a
better time efficient option
no because you probably only lose
something like three percent
of body fat during that time and the
rest is probably some combination of
body water
and very temporary muscle loss so no
those two are probably not comparable
being able to lose five percent body fat
over five weeks is one hell of an
accomplishment
and is unlikely to occur and then he
says war mini cuts mainly used for
resensitization
uh to some extent yes uh they are used
to re-sensitize you sort of
nutritionally a little bit training-wise
too
uh for further hypertrophy which means
they only ever really buy you
man two to four percent lower body fat
for being pretty extreme kind of like
two to three percent
just a little bit of bump so you
continue masking for another few muscle
cycles
he says kind of confused if my goal is
to get leaner over time
should i switch between a mass phase and
mini cut nope mini cuts are only massive
mass phase mini cut is designed to make
you fatter over time
just not as fat as you would otherwise
be it's designed to make you muscular
over time but it won't address leanness
the periodization you have to do if you
want to get leaner over time
is massing maintaining and regular
cutting
where the masses are maybe two mesos
long and at you know a slow rate of gain
the maintaining is you know meso or
maybe
just an active rest then the cutting is
like three mesos long or like 12 weeks
you do a bunch of those and over time
you get still gain some muscle but you
get much leaner if you want to get much
leaner
really go down all the way to where
you start at a baseline of much leaner
skip the masking phases all together and
just stack maintenance phases and fat
loss phases back to back to back to back
it's a little bit more humbling you're
not going to be making gains during that
time but you'll get the whole process
out of the way
for most people two or three of those
macro cycles
of maintenance phases plus cutting
phases is going to drop
20 to 30 pounds of body fat off their
body and they'll be lean enough to be
ready to do whatever
so it's absolutely a consideration you
can take but no mini cutting
is not a way to get leaner long term
period is a way to potentiate further
mass gains
in the short term short term mass
potentiation
um and
that is basically the essence of this
question james anything
i know i can't let it go i was trying
not to i can't let it go
abdulrahman i appreciate your question
but look at this
if my goal is to get leaner over time
should i switch between a mass phase in
a minute so first of all
mass phase is out of the question if
your goal is to get leaner out of over
time right we just throw that out the
window
and then a mini cut while trying to be
in a net deficit where the fat
lost in the mini cut is more gained in
the the mass like
ah no that is a disaster
that is the complete opposite of both
things that you should be trying to do
because like what are you doing in that
mass phase where the mini cut
ends up in a net calorie deficit for the
time like oh my
god what you're crazy so no i'm not
trying to
bag on you here but just you know when
you think about it logically it's like
oh shit should i
should i be massing to lose weight no
should i be like doing
suicidal mini cuts no don't do that
do a reasonable you know weight loss
over time whatever some people can do
maybe like 10 weeks i have some clients
who are particularly gritty and they can
do like 15 weeks
and and become okay pick what works for
you
understand that like the longer you do
any of the cut blocks the longer you're
going to generally have to maintain and
the more of subsequent cut blocks you do
the longer each of the maintenance
phases will likely become
downstream like that's just part of the
deal yeah um
don't try and get there quick and don't
think that you can like pepper in some
like fun mass phases to
escape the pain you can but it's gonna
cost you
longer putting so
i would say i think you're just i don't
know where you're coming from but i
would say
take a deep breath do something else for
a minute come back to it and then you'll
look at it and be like
what was i talking about that's crazy
talk i should just do like what a
reasonable person would do
which is like do a weight loss phase
recuperate
rinse and repeat that's perfectly okay
no shame in that game pretty much 90
of the people that i have worked with
throughout my career at rp do that
that's just the norm so don't feel weird
about it it's totally fine
boom is that it for today that's it for
today
okay one last funny one here is anyone
else noticing
enter the kettlebell pavel satsulin here
oh my god it's like it's just
look at this sexual kettlebell russian
army
what what is this picture who approved
this as the thumbnail that's what i like
who somebody looked at that and was like
yes somebody clever because that
motherfucker got 2.5 million views
japheo
i think it's because of the thumbnail
it's so provocative is it you're like is
he gonna have sex with that kettlebell
am i gonna have sex with him
maybe if i like it and then post a
comment i will yay
all right let's see um folks i've done
my my final pass
on the hypertrophy well i guess it's not
the final pass but it's the final like
editing pass before we all do it one
final pass
uh on the book so that's good i think
hopefully i think mike said within the
next month or two
so that's looking really good um i'm
going to do another video
soon
um just sports stuff so i'm going to
introduce some of the concepts that i've
been working
on in the uh the book that i'm trying to
publish with rp which is the new volume
landmarks book so i'm going to introduce
the idea of applying the volume
landmarks to
fitness skills and tactics for sports so
i'm going to try and work on that and do
some q a
but that's all i really got mike you got
anything fun i think that's about
it man uh we're putting out she
yeah i will say this um our videographer
just recorded uh some sessions of jared
and i training and he's making it like
really artsy and like training
motivation type videos they're going to
be fucking amazing so just just
their music and everything so if you
need some pre-training videos to get
pumped to go train we got you covered
well seeing as how we grew up in a time
where bodybuilders were putting out like
promotional pump up videos i don't know
how i couldn't get pumped up from that
shit you know how many times i watched
like a branch warren
ronnie coleman videos lex wheeler 1992
with the leotard fucking vhs
quality yes i love it love it all right
folks
thank you very much for engaging with us
make sure you guys subscribe there's all
sorts of just
wackadoo nonsense and some good stuff on
the rp youtube channel there's all sorts
of videos it feels
feels like there's like three or four
per week at this point it feels over
every time
i try to find the weekly webinar so i
can look for the questions i'm like yeah
holy shit there's so many videos all
right we'll continue
good problems to have make sure you guys
subscribe and thanks for engaging with
us
this is dr james dr mike see you next
time
