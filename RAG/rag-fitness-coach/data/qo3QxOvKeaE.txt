pretty sick little teenager huh
aren't they all
oh damn man
i've got a leg pump when nobody's
fucking business
oh we're just starting to have fun
all right folks the hack squatting has
gone off to an excellent start and now
we do an excellent finish with
the
pendulum squat or whatever the fuck this
is called pendulum
whatever we call it the hemorrhoid maker
detroit in detroit apparently they call
it hemorrhoid maker someone from down
river says that you can treat it
skeptically because those people are all
oh they're down river folk they're
different if you're using this machine
guys
what you want to do
is make sure in most cases
you put your feet
nice and low on the platform high on the
platform you'll be able to lift more
weight but it'll be less specific to the
quads low on the platform means you get
lots of knee flexion and then lots of
muscle growth
always a slow and controlled descent
shows how it's done we're always going
to pause i actually have never done this
machine before oh look at this guy here
you kill the guys
theoretically i think that's how it
works it's gonna be really hard to make
this go down slow that's the hardest
part all the way full pause yes and all
the way up
good and a couple more just to get in
there
sets or wraps oh
i'm not quite sure yet on sets but uh
reps are going to be around the 15 rep
ranges
now if you wanted to keep something like
this out of your lower back how would
you do that this machine really probably
does that pretty well and you put your
feet as low as possible okay
getting tips from the master
guru
all day don't let them charlie with you
show
