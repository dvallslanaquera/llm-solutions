hey folks dr mike here from renaissance
periodization and today's bs topic
claim rather is that it's better to not
take blood pressure medications
and
it's
so much better not to take them that
it's just worth trying to reduce your
blood pressure naturally through diet
and exercise and all those good things
even natural supplements that reduce
blood pressure well let's take a look
and why is this yes after all
so
yes
if you have high blood pressure
you absolutely should be in almost every
case trying to lose weight
and improve your health in a myriad of
other ways
exercise and diet and so on and so forth
so that your blood pressure falls
to a very low number
and yes ideally
you should not have to take medicines to
be healthy
agreed not some pill pushing big pharma
jerk with a suit and a tie and
prophets for oil on his shoes
all the same people the people running
the world man
in any case yeah it would be sweet to be
healthy without having to take any
medication agreed at the very least just
something you don't have to take any
every morning and miss a dose blah blah
blah however
however
chronic high blood pressure even mildly
elevated chronic high blood pressure
wreaks fucking havoc on every single
organ system you have it fucking
destroys your body
arguably the worst part about it is this
is so subtle
other than the blood pressure cuff
telling you you're going to die soon
it's asymptomatic you can't even tell if
you have other than extremely high blood
pressure which is
when you feel like this and you're like
fuck fuck fuck you can't even tell
the fucking big silent killer is high
blood pressure and it doesn't kill you
in a year it doesn't kill you in five
but in 15 years when you're 45 years old
and you got you know your your kids are
starting to go to college or something
and you're excited about potential
grandchildren
you go see your doctor and your doctor
is like your kidneys will stop working
right now go to dialysis forever
and by the way you're in the beginning
of losing your color vision and then all
the rest of your vision do you have a
cut on your foot that's not healing so
well you're like yeah well the blood
pressure fucked up that too and actually
through a variety of mechanisms blood
pressure fucked with your kidneys and
fucked with your pancreas and fucked
everything else you're also now
pre-diabetic you'll have diabetes soon
i mean every organ system oh ps your
heart is too big but not in a good way
because it's been pushing against this
chronic high blood pressure now it's
gonna try to give up on you pretty
fucking soon
bad news
bad news
in the overweight blood pressure is one
of the top killers
in the non-overweight blood pressure
high chronic even mildly elevated is one
of the top killers it's just bad fucking
news
so
if you want to take a very serious stab
at addressing your blood pressure
because i think maybe i have convinced
you so far maybe if not sorry
if i've convinced you so far that high
blood pressure chronically is bad
there is a three-tiered approach to how
to deal and here it is you show up to
the doctor and it turns out you have
high blood pressure okay
probably the best course of action of
course to be confirmed by your doctor
but what i'm telling you is when the
doctor brings this up don't resist
right
let the blood pressure meds flow through
you
meh
isn't emperor palpatine so great so many
great lines
tier one when you get diagnosed with
high blood pressure and you have some
reason to believe it is chronic even no
reason to believe it is chronic
as long as there is no obvious like oh
yeah i've been drinking 10 gallons of
salt water a day type of reasons
get on blood pressure meds asap to get
your blood pressure controlled asap
get it right back into the normal range
the modern
[Music]
ecosystem of pharmacology surrounding
blood pressure
i don't even know what generation of
blood pressure drugs we're on it's like
six
and
it doesn't really matter how high your
blood pressure is there is a combination
of drugs or a dosing of drugs or some
combination of dosing and number of
drugs that can get it well into the
lower realm matter of fact people who od
in their blood pressure drugs pass out
because of ultra low blood pressure your
blood pressure can be lowered by
pharmacology in almost every case to a
very healthy level
next
once your low blood pressure is
controlled which is to say later that
day when you pick up your script from
walmart and go like this
keep taking the blood pressure meds and
then start to thread in that lifestyle
intervention that you were so busy
telling people you're so excited about
because i never gonna use them drugs man
i'm gonna do it the right way i'm gonna
do it healthy natural
great
now that you're on the drugs also
try the natural stuff which is the
long-term stuff that can really help
lower your blood pressure via fitness
control your diet probably lose some fat
get your training in check train hard
get your lifestyle in check stop smoking
meth cigarettes or whatever the hell
you're doing that is causing you high
blood pressure reduce stress et cetera
et cetera et cetera but here's the thing
those things take time they take days
they take weeks they take months they
take years
to slowly bring your blood pressure down
to what it can be when it's in a good
range
but what you want to do is bring it down
with pharmacology first
and then as you improve your health
you will need less and less and less
pharmacology in order to keep your blood
pressure normal because if you take the
same amount of drugs that you were back
when you were 290 and ultra unhealthy by
the time five years later you get to 220
and pretty fucking damn healthy you'll
have to take like one-fifth the dose or
half of the blood pressure medicines
that you used to amazing awesome awesome
awesome
if at the end of this journey your blood
pressure is now so low with meds
any meds even low dose that you're like
stand up out of a chair and you're like
holy fuck i had to sit back down i was
almost passing out
if that's the case for you you can
absolutely with the blessings of your
doctor come off of the blood pressure
medicine and then you won't be on
medicine and then you can fucking
harangue everyone you see about how well
i got such good shape i don't even need
blood pressure medicine anymore i don't
know why you're a southern man seemingly
from tennessee and this impersonation
that's all i have for today god damn it
that's cool however if you get to a
point where you are at a healthy weight
you're managing all of the lifestyle
variables you can be and have been for a
while
but your blood pressure is still too
high if you don't take the meds
keep taking the fucking meds how long dr
mike forever
modern blood pressure medicines
are ultra safe ultra sustainable and
basically don't have side effects i know
they have nominal side effects but in
the real world they fucking don't
i've taken a few different blood
pressure medicines i'm now
tmi i'm on now what am i on 10
milligrams every morning of amylodipine
and
that fuck if i know how it works but
i'll tell you this i can't tell if i
take it or if i don't the only way i
would know is if i stopped taking it my
blood pressure would go like this which
i'm absolutely fucking not interested in
dr mike aren't you healthy and why do
you take blood pressure meds because
they weigh 250 pounds and i'm sauced up
to the fucking moon
within reason
by ifbb standards no but by human
standards yes
so the blood pressure meds counteract
here's the thing you don't have to be
sauced up to the moon to have chronic
high blood pressure even if you're
otherwise healthy
one of the number one causes of chronic
high blood pressure is
just you have the genetics for having
high blood pressure and even though
you're eating it all kale vegan only
keto carnivore diet and you're spending
18 hours every single hour think about
that time portal hyperbolic time chamber
at the gym your blood pressure could
still be chronically
elevated and
that's just a thing that happens
and then you take blood pressure
medicine
so to recap
you have high blood pressure
get on medicine bring it down to
normal work on all the other health
stuff that gives you high blood pressure
and everything else
if you control your blood pressure
because you're ultra obese and super out
of shape and a cigarette smoker
that shit is killing you in 50 different
other ways that doesn't include blood
pressure so you should still be trying
to get fit and lean and healthy for all
those other reasons but blood pressure
is no longer one of them
once you get fit lean and healthy and
everything's great
your doctor as you get there will
titrate your blood pressure medicine to
make sure you don't get too low in the
blood pressures
if at the end of that you can come off
all the blood pressure meds and it's
great amazing amazing
if at the end of that you still need 10
milligrams of lysine or whatever a day
to keep in your good blood pressure
range
awesome who gives a flying fuck you have
this pill made by big pharma i know it's
evil
and it allows you to live for five years
longer at the tail end of your life
because it's preventing you from having
high blood pressure for no fucking
reason that you're aware of just fucking
pure genetics
and it's saving your ass and the pill
costs like
a cent a day or something blood pressure
medicine is almost free i have no idea
how the companies make it even fucking
make money i'd gladly pay 10 times the
amount for blood pressure i also tip my
landlord many of you guys catch that
meme
in any case
this whole idea
of well
i don't want to get on blood pressure
meds for my blood pressure i want to
deal with the old-fashioned ways fucking
bullshit
because at the end of the day
the potential downsides
of the negative health
or poisoning
or my children turn out to be frogs
instead of children when i have them
because the dna got messed up by the
blood pressure meds whatever the risks
are there and there are some risks and
downsides
they're this big
and the risks of chronic uncontrolled
high blood pressure or even the risks of
taking several months to get in shape to
get your blood pressure go down or
several months risks is like this
and never controlled risks is like
through the fucking ceiling in the
studio here
at some point it's uh
you're just saying dumb shit
pharmacology is your friend it's used
wisely
in the time when it's a good idea and
with the direction of your doctor
and if you have some ideas about that
well i don't want to use the medicine
it's a crutch it's not a fucking crutch
it's a tool
right
i sound so mean today
[Applause]
just been under a lot of stress
i do um i do a lot of you guys probably
know this i do a lot of mail modeling
and uh
i've just been getting a lot of work i
was at a modeling convention in hong
kong a few days ago i just flew back
