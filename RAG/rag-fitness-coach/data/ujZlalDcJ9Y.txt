hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization strength
training myths video number five
you must train the assistance lifts to
get better at the core lifts
is the claim is the myth what's on the
agenda for today we're going to talk
about the claim specifically
kind of sounds like an odd claim but i
promise it has actually been made
and written into books and videos we're
going to talk about
how assistance lifts to the core lifts
and strength actually do help
then we're going to talk about
situations which assistance are given a
little bit too much credit
we're going to essentially expose their
limitations and then we're going to talk
about what the best approach is
combining assistance lifts with core
lifts
to actually get as strong as possible on
the core lifts which matter the most
so the claim is
that you know a lot of people say you
know the way to really it's almost like
they
phrase this as kind of like a hack like
um an unexpected discovery
something counter-intuitive they said
you know the real way to improve your
core lifts the real way to improve your
deadlift is to not deadlift all right
people have legit made that claim before
so say you know
the way to boost your lifts is really
via systems work like yeah
junior leaguers think like i want to be
a better bencher i just bench a lot no
no no no
the real why shit is the assistance lift
really improves your lift
and then the competition lift is where
you compete in okay that's the claim
the more extreme version of that claim
is they'll say you know at some point
the core lifts really just don't bring
up uh that bring themselves up anymore
and you have to switch to mostly
assistance work
to do the heavy lifting pun intended um
you know when you're a beginner maybe an
intermediate actually practicing squats
bench and deadlifts
will increase them the best but when
you're more advanced you've got to do
these
really and oftentimes the selling point
is really kind of wonky
strange dare i say you know sort of
irrationally creative assistance lifts
which seem to be like an exercise
in avoiding the actual hard work of
doing the core lifts or avoiding boredom
in any case like these are the special
assistance lifts that are going to get
you
these amazing gains this is how the
world champs do it you'd have to be a
dupe to think that you're going to get
to world championship level just only or
mostly doing the core lifts and then its
most extreme form
is the claim that you should do the core
lifts very rarely
maybe only in the few weeks leading up
to the actual meet itself for
powerlifting
and that everything else should be
assistance work this is not a character
i can assure
you this is the literal philosophy
espoused uh by variations of the barbell
training
method and uh sorry west side barbell
training method
and uh if you retort with the claim that
well it's not real west side because it
wasn't done at west side this was
actually done at west side barbell
right so people do put a lot of stock as
they probably should because west side
has had a lot of success
into what west side does and related
philosophies and they will try stuff
like this like i've seen tons of people
do deadlift programs completely bereft
of deadlifting
until they actually show up and there's
a deadlift bar on the ground
on the meet day okay 16 week power
lifting cycle of training
no deadlifting to be done until the
deadlift or until maybe the last two or
three sessions
is that the best idea in the world is
assistance lift work really really that
powerful
okay now assistance lifts to the power
lifts
are great at about three things and
three categories of things
they actually do have really good
utility first of all they're really good
at putting on muscle to boost your core
lifts
sometimes better at putting on muscle
than the actual lifts themselves
all right why because they oftentimes
have better stimulus to fatigue ratios
for hypertrophy than the lifts
themselves so for example if you do a
competition
style bench press wide grip really big
arch
it limits your range of motion not great
for hypertrophy also because you're
arching the back the entire time it
really just fatigues the fuck out of
your lower back and you have to go super
heavy
to get anything out of it because the
range of motion is so short so all of a
sudden the stimulus is pretty good but
the fatigue is really gnarly
if you do more flat back benching with
just a little bit of retraction or like
low incline work
you get a fucking massive hit to your
pecs front delts
triceps great hypertrophy stimulus but
the fatigue is lower
so the stimulus the fatigue ratio a lot
of times of accessory lifts
or assistance lifts is may in many cases
may be better
than the core lift sounds
counter-intuitive but remember the core
lifts are strength lifts they're not
hypertrophy
lifts so sometimes this absolutely works
in addition to that
assistance lifts sometimes have a better
sfr for what's what i can call
gap filling for the actual core lifts
even in strength not just hypertrophy so
for example if you're having
uh you know the in a bench press to pop
off the chest is great but you're having
real trouble with the lockout
if you just only bench press you're like
that's it you've got a bench press
you know this here doesn't improve your
lockout
but it's summing a lot of fatigue and by
the time you get to your lockout you're
pretty tired
so the actual stimulus to fatigue ratio
of your lockout work
in a full range of motion bench isn't
amazing
right it's kind of like you want to
train your sprint for 100 meters
but you always lead in with a mile run
and then sprint for 100. well if you
fucking didn't lead in with a mile run
you'd be better at sprinting 100 meters
you would improve at it more
what the fuck is the mile run for just
the same way in bench pressing
what you might want to do is do some
rack pressing or some
pin pressing or some board pressing in
which you actually just do the lockout
work itself
that's the thing that's missing in your
plan or that's the thing that's missing
in your abilities
that's your weak point train it directly
great stimulus to fatigue ratio as far
as training lockouts
doesn't get better than doing the
lockout work then later once your
lockouts are much better you go back to
full range of motion bench pressing and
oh my god it's way higher because this
was never a problem
but now this is much better so
assistance lifts are absolutely great
at targeting specific weak points often
times better than the lifts themselves
and they're really great at building
hypertrophy and strength
when you need a break from the core
lifts psychologically
you can only do so many competition
style squats you just don't fucking ever
want to see them again
and that's important but also important
is the fact that if you do competition
stop squatting back pressing and
deadlifting
you're going to start to pay for it with
uh sort of connective tissue maybe not
injuries
but sort of wear and tear right that
exact way you do competition
squats your hips are starting to hurt a
little bit if you just switch to hack
squats
or front squats or high bar regular
closed stance squats then you may get
excellent
squat progress but the brake itself is
what's needed
so for that the assistance lifts are
really really awesome
however they can be given too much
credit
and in this myth they absolutely are so
what are their limitations well
first of all sometimes with
all the best intentions in the world
they just don't fucking transfer
you may think they should transfer you
may think increasing an assistance lift
will boost your core lift but it just
doesn't right
and even if they do transfer sometimes
it's like a guessing and hoping game of
which ones transfer which ones don't how
much they transfer and would you be
better off
just training the core lifts themselves
here's the thing the core lifts
always transfer it gets the identity
property a equals eight there's no
transfer required
if your low bar squat goes up your low
bar squat went up
because there's no like did it transfer
of course there's no transfer needed
however if your high bar squat went up
did your low bar squat go up
well maybe usually but maybe your low
bar squat is limited
by your posterior chain strength like
your legs are plenty strong but in a low
bar remember you're actually
cantilever a little bit more forward
your back gets a more horizontal
position
and maybe your limiting factor is the
posterior chain
use of actually rising up and and
tilting your back backwards
in that case if that's really limiting
factor what would increase your low bar
squat is
more squatting for sure maybe something
like good mornings stiff legged
deadlifts
some deadlift work even that could
increase your low bar squat whereas high
bar squat
would just make your legs stronger but
if they're not the weak point in the
chain
your squat might not go up and that's a
very simple transfer some people do
machine presses dumbbell incline
dips and they expect a bench press to go
up i remember one time i had an example
of this
i took my dips and i essentially added
like 90 pounds to my dips for like sets
of
five to ten i was doing like and this i
think this is on youtube
um i was like 220 pounds and i was doing
a set of 10
super deep dips with 135 pounds hanging
between my waist like
holy fuck i had zero transfer to the
bench press i was competitive power
lifter at the time
nothing i fucking did i did dips for
like three fucking months
and a dick happened that sucks there's
no problem like that with core lifts so
it's nothing you ever have to worry
about
number two in the short term
weeks to months nothing builds your core
lifts
like training your core lifts right
anatomical adaptations are direct
the way that low bar squats stretch your
quads is exactly how they need to be
stressed to become better at low bar
squats
and there's a technical adaptation there
that's huge practicing movement makes
you better at the movement
so while assistance lifts are all great
and all they have to stand in reverence
of the core lifts as still the best
right like you know you they may be
great and all
but they always to some extent have to
play second fiddle
and we can't just pretend that's not a
thing and say core lifts are stupid
assistance lifts you can build your
whole arsenal with them that's just not
true
right and in number three another
way to really screw yourself over is a
lot of people
can progress really well on the
assistance lifts
um bored of or irritated by physically
some kind of irritation by the core
lifts
so what they end up doing is they just
do essentially almost or exclusively
assistance lifts
if you're doing this it has to be done
for a very compelling reason like you
have to be hurt or something like that
a lot of folks will do core lifts with
poor fatigue management
too much load too much frequency too
much volume something like that
and what they'll do is they'll start
replacing core lifts with assistance
lifts
because these systems lifts often are
less disruptive less fatiguing
and because they irritate or fatigue
slightly different structures than the
core lifts
you're essentially using those
assistance lifts as fatigue management
it's using variation as a proxy for
fatigue management
good news it can keep you training bad
news the training is no longer specific
and you don't get as strong on the core
lift as you could
a better approach would be if you still
used mostly core lifts
but you had heavier and light sessions
higher volume lower volume sessions and
you manage your frequency intelligently
and you deloaded when you had to
um or versus when your body's breaking
apart so a lot of times
people move away from core lifts
completely because they're doing core
lifts wrong
they're approaching that whole thing
wrong and to them it's like obvious that
oh assistance work works better for me
that's mostly because you suck at doing
the coral it's like
if you're used to eating fettuccine
alfredo pasta but you fucking suck at
making fettuccine alfredo sauce
uh then you know at some point you're
like you know i just eat red sauce with
with ground beef now and people are like
oh wine you're like
i hate fettuccine alfredo just it's not
one of my favorite foods and someone who
can cook in that audience that you're
saying that too they're like
i mentioned this modifier doesn't know
how to cook but it actually shows you
how to make really good fettuccino if
they're like oh my god this is the
fucking shit
how the fuck did i ever get away from
this because you fucking blew dicks at
it like
a lot of people have that their
technique will suck on the core lifts
they'll fatigue manage them properly or
they'll just like assistance lift like
how they make them feel
they get into a groove in which they get
stronger like you'll see guys posting
about this like
my fucking close grip bench is
skyrocketing like last couple months
i've been training it a lot
someone's like you know how's your
regular bench like well i don't have
trained in a while like
good luck we go back to that point of
hopefully it'll transfer may not
and like yeah it's nice that you're
getting a bigger close grip bench but
what the fuck is happening to your
actual competition bench
that has to be a concern if you are
actually a competitor
so taking all this together looks like
assistance lifts definitely have their
pluses
they definitely have their limitations
how do we approach this to get the best
possible sort of training first of all
use the core lifts
when their stimulus to fatigue ratios
are the highest for the job
interestingly enough for beginners this
will basically be all the time
so if you're designing a beginner
powerlifting program and boris shaco is
very very good at this kind of stuff and
you can see a lot of sample programs on
the internet you can buy his book
actually on the rp website
a lot of those programs for beginners is
just a ton
of squatting bench pressing and
deadlifting because they're the best for
strength and hypertrophy and peaking for
beginners there's no derivation of
of different specificity uh paradigms
there because they're just so good at
everything and that's totally great
and as a beginner you want a huge
technical base there's no way to get
that other than tons of practice with
the core lifts
you guys ever see russians power lifting
and you're like
fuck is this guy's technique identical
from the bar
to fucking 800 pounds that's like a
common thing about eastern european
lifters
well because this motherfucker's been
practicing squatting since he was 10 and
he's done so many fucking low bar squats
and you're like what kind of assistance
work do you do and you're like
i don't really do a whole lot they might
do like ooh i front squat on occasion
like
that sucks all i'm doing is assistance
work right there's a way to get that
good
takes a shitload of practice point
number two
when assistance lifts have situationally
higher stimulus to fatigue ratios that
means they accomplish the task
better at a lower or equal amount of
fatigue cost
than you use them but here's the deal
this isn't written in the slides
they have to earn their keep if you're
doing an assistance lift and someone
asks you hey you're a competitive
powerlifter right like of course
don't look the part and they're like why
are you doing that it's not a power lift
you had
better have a fucking good answer oh
they're like well i really like close
grip bench
or you're like it helps me with my
lockout and they're like do you struggle
with your lockout you're like
no i struggle off the chest so what the
fuck are you doing that i don't know
right they have to have situationally
better stimulus to fatigue ratios they
have to earn their keep they has to be a
compelling reason to use them
a lot of times that means they're really
good at targeting hypertrophy
especially uh in specific muscles that
you
are on uncharacteristically weaker in
your kinetic chain
and or specific strength gaps so you can
use you know
uh incline bench to get bigger pecs
because your packs are lagging
or you can use a close grip bench press
with a partial range of motion just at
the top and lockouts to get your lockout
better both work but there has to be
reasons for them that has to be the
problem you're fixing
if you don't have that problem if you
just need to be stronger all around but
there's no single limiting
factor you're probably better off doing
the core lifts and not the assistance
lifts
every now and again you might want to
just go to assistance lifts or mostly
when the core lifts become stale you do
a whole strength phase with mostly core
lifts
you do a peeking phase with almost
exclusively core lifts by then
you're fucking burned out of the core
lifts and they're really irritating a
bunch of structures
you can absolutely do your first phase
of hypertrophy training with no core
lifts at all
not because you know yeah they are
better at hypertrophy sometimes
the core the competition lifts the core
lifts can be really good too but you're
just done with them
you need that break and after four or
six weeks you come back to the
competition the core lifts and
everything's fresh it's new it works
that's a super good reason to use
assistance lifts and not core lifts
point number three when you're using a
lot of assistance work
for overloading purposes okay you
absolutely can do that
so high bar squats taking higher and
higher and higher will absolutely in in
most cases unless you have like a weird
limiting factor of just a posterior
chain of something which is quite rare
hybrid squats will improve your low bar
squat but the best way to do that
isn't just to do the high bar squats but
do your heavy work overloading work with
high bar squats for example or flat
flatback bench or whatever it is you're
doing that's an assistance left not the
core lift
still have the core lift in there even
though you can't or don't want to train
it heavy
at least train it light for technique so
while the high bar squats really power
your ability to lift weights
right your core strength the core lift
the low bar squat competition stance is
still there as a light lift for
technique work
so your technique on that doesn't slip
off much and actually maybe continues to
improve
so when you get into your later phases
of the cycle and you have to do
heavy core lifting it's not an alien
thing to you it's
much easier to transfer high bar
squatting strength
to competition squatting strength if
you've been doing competition squats
like the entire time you've never
forgotten anything
it's smooth as day but if you like went
eight weeks without touching a low bar
squat at all
it's going to be a rough transition
sometimes that's okay sometimes it's
short-sighted
eventually using all of these things
together your training will look
something like this
your hypertrophy phase will be lots of
assistance work
some core work often times much lighter
just for the purposes of maintaining
technique and sometimes no core work at
all
especially if it's really irritated your
strength phase
will be lots of core work and some
assistance work to fill in the gaps fill
in the
strength where you know maybe your
lockout's not as good strength off the
floor on the deadlift's not as good you
need specific assistance left to address
those problems
peaking phase will be almost exclusively
core work
when you're up to it it'll be heavy and
hard to make you better when you're too
fucked up it'll be light
and easy to keep your technique going
there's very little place
for assistance work in a peaking program
because it just isn't justified stimulus
to fatigue wisely why the fuck are we
doing that what is it getting us that's
that is better than core work at the
time and a lot of times the answer is
not really there are some cases in which
that's
that actually happens but then the
assistance work is minimally involved
you're not going to have a peaking phase
ideally which is mostly assistance work
that's insane
and there there has to be a damn good
reason for doing that
for active rest after your peaking phase
one to three weeks for power lifting
should be taken super easy training or
no training at all you stayed a fuck
away
from core work assistance work only if
you're doing any gym work at all
that's the time when your core work your
squat your bench and deadlift
competition style are the most irritated
the most overreached the most stale
you can completely get away from the men
should to let the joint structures heal
back
up to let your mind heal back up and get
excited about doing the core lifts again
and then when you enter your next
hypertrophy phase you get into lots of
assistance work
and potentially some core work that's
the way it should work ideally
no crazy exaggerations no weird dogmas
folks
see you next time for the next myth
you
