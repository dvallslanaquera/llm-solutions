lighter weight

no competition there has been
a lot of beef between the korean peoples
and the chinese people now we're here

to settle this shit once and for all
stop fighting each other both
americans right and there's been and
there's been so much intra-asian
conflict you know on the streets what
news channel we're here
i am the news this is the news so
we're here to make sure we settle this
once and for all the only rational
ethical way we know how which is a side
delt hold challenge
so rational crucifix hold what they're
going to be doing
is they're going to have their
respective dumbbell scale to their
strength
they're going to be holding them above
parallel jerry let's show them what that
looks like
this is a continuing victory if it
descends below parallel they get one
warning they can try to correct it if
they get
they never get two warnings after that
they're done and there remains one
winner who subsumes that culture
entirely
korean food no it's chinese food now or
the other way around
let's find out which asian culture
remains can we just play piano
i'm gonna be judging charlie jared you
