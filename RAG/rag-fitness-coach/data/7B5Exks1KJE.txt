hey folks it's Dr Mike for Renaissance
periodization welcome to the targeting
the muscle series today's muscle is
the back muscles plural and the exercise
is the barbell bent over row
we're going to give you a few tips and
tricks to get you to feel the barbell
bent row more in the part of your back
that you want let's get started
[Music]
alright folks so the first big tip for
properly bet rowing and getting your
back to actually get a hit
is the practice of hinging into the
movement versus bending into the
movement
so if you just bend over notice my
rounded lower back
and you do bent rows like that's cool
your arms are moving your back is
ostensibly pulling them sweet
the problem is that as soon as you round
your spine
two things happen
one your pulling muscles get much weaker
because anytime your back is rounder the
Central Drive coming from your brain
through your spinal cord reduces because
your body thinks it's not stable or safe
you can't literally row as much with
your back if you round your back then if
you keep your back flat
the second thing is that backgrounding
means that the spinal erector muscles
have to work from a much more stretched
position a mechanically disadvantageous
position they have to try a lot harder
to make sure you don't like pop your
vertebrae out of your asshole or
whatever they do if they turn off so
because your lower back muscles are
always in a poor position they tend to
be the thing that gives out first so if
you're trying to train your spinal
rectors at a lengthened isometric
position while pretending to train your
rest of your pulling muscles that's a
great way to Bend Road ideally what you
want to do is give a challenge to your
spinal Erectors
something they may not get on a chest
supporter Road but you also want to put
them and the back into the most
mechanically favorable position that
allows all the other muscles to come
close to failure and gives you a really
strong launch point for being able to
really contract those muscles so instead
of bending over
there shouldn't be event over row being
super pedantic should be a hinge road if
you do is you basically do this to flick
a deadlift down to the bar notice my
tummy's out my back is nice and tight
I've hinged using my hips not my back my
back is straight my spinal Erectors are
strong
I grabbed the bar and then
rowing as easy as fuck and I can roll
hundreds of pounds and all of it is my
back
instead of just my spiral Erectors lats
Erectors rhomboids traps everything
with maximum load because they're strong
in a strong position not rounded over
I'm nice and tight
give that a thought
all right
next tip
if you want to completely isolate small
muscles in your back
what you want to do is make sure that
your scapulae don't protract or retract
at all
even though tons of back muscles that
are fucking gnarly and awesome and big
help to do that and if you do that those
muscles grow and then you look like the
fucking tank
if you want the betro to be like a
really shitty version
of a chest supported row then by all
means keep your scaps stable
you hear people on recommendations
saying keep your scap stable in rows
Namaste thank you for your opinion
kindly step the fuck out
a real bent over row uses all of the
muscles in your back that means that at
the bottom you're going to protract your
scapulae
and at the top you're going to retract
it's going to happen naturally just
because of the way you move so
instead of having a row or nice and
arched
and we do this
notice my arms are stopping at this
weird Point instead of that
watch what my shoulder blades do
stretched at the beginning
come back
Big Stretch come back
Big Stretch my shoulder blades come
forward every time notice my back is
still arched
by doing that
you get your whole back involved
at some point you're going to get your
back so big
friends will just no longer want to hang
out with you unless I Loved You Frank
you were great but you're back stupid
[Music]
the last tip was about allowing your
scapulae to protract at the bottom
but if you allow your scaps to protract
and you start dropping your chest there
can be a lot of movement in the spine
which is sweet for reflection row but
we're not trying to do a flexion row we
are trying to do a regular barbell row
if at the bottom we focus on keeping our
chest up while simultaneously allowing
our scaps to travel forward
stretches the living fuck out of your
upper back and makes for an awesome
hypertrophy stimulus so
instead of bent rowing
like this foreign
what we do is Arch our back nice and
tight and begin with a chest super
upright
and we're going to hold that position
chest up
chest up
Big Stretch
chest up oh fuck even with this demo
weight I feel my shit all fucked up
that folks is a good thing
[Music]
what about grip width
where do you want to grab here's the
actual answer
there are tons of right answers and it
all depends on two things
one is stimulus to fatigue ratio okay
some people are built a certain way that
when they grab here they're going to
feel an amazing stimulus to the back and
the fatigue is going to be low some
people they're going to grab here it's
going to be best some people are even
going to grab here and it's going to be
best
the other thing is variation you may be
used to grabbing like this for a few
months it gets stale now you grab out
here it gets better
try a bunch of different grip widths
even underhand especially if you have an
easy bar you may find that it's all
winners
next where to touch the bar
just one simple rule
the closer the touch is this way
sternum chest
Etc the more of your upper back
especially rhomboid mid-trap musculature
is engaged cool
the closer you touch towards your hips
the lower you touch the fractionally
more lat involvement you get but you
still get a bunch of that other shit too
there's no correct answer here shoot
just two different variations right so
if
you're in a position where you're
getting the bar here
and you touch
right up to the chest more upper back
even more rear delts on the other hand
if you touch right into the hips
it's a bit more lat
there's no right way or wrong way just
know the stuff
so when you're targeting whatever part
of your back that you're targeting with
rows which could be multiple Parts
you're doing the right variation or
anywhere on that Spectrum
that gets you your goals check marked
[Music]
what about deficits
here's the rule with throwing
as long as your back is tight
and your arms are straight and stretched
at the bottom
and you can still get that full stretch
it's the correct answer
if that occurs for you here at a spine
Bend like they're at a hip Bend like
this
fine here fine here still totally cool
if you are flexible enough
regular plates may not allow you to get
a full stretch at the bottom and you may
want a bit more of a Bend because
generally the further over you bend the
more of your mid and lower back can get
hit versus if you just uh if you bent
over right here it's almost all upper
back
so you can do something like this you
can take one of these
little hunky-dory rubber mats
push it under
Step Up and bet roll off of it totally
fine you can do many mats
instead of using these kinds of 25s you
can use the regular 25s which are
smaller Auto creates a deficit no wrong
answers in my bodybuilding career so far
I've done
25 rows I've done 35's rows slightly
elevated I've done regular rows all the
time
back when I started I was so inflexible
even
the regular handles I couldn't the
regular size plates I couldn't touch the
ground with so
here's the thing as long as your back is
tight
and this is stretched you're already
doing it right if you can slowly get
down and get even deeper on average
it'll make it a little bit better but
never ever ever go to a deficit which
requires you to round your back or lose
a huge fraction of how much weight you
can lift from the ground
stick with those tips folks and you'll
have such a big back people on the
street will come up to you and go hey
I'm no big deal but did you know that
you had a fucking huge back we'd be like
hey thanks a lot and I'm Matt we'll see
you guys next time
