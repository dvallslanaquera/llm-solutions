bent over rows with 20 pound dumbbells
by the side of your beach house and
Saint Arts is not going to get you the
mentality of a Navy SEAL and I know that
sounds crazy
[Music]
I'm Dr Mike Israel creator of the RP
hypertrophy app and professor of
exercise and Sport Science at Lehman
College and I want to take a look at
Michael B Jordan's workout plan that
keeps him in oh such stunning shape
Michael B Jordan if you're watching this
two things
hello and also
hello
anyway let's get to it
Saint Barts of course
the cardio is a fine way to do things
it's exactly as effective as fed State
cardio so it's not magic just just uh
calling that out but if acid cardio
totally fine so like being in the pool
is a full body workout
your core and your lower legs upper body
core and lower legs the upper leg is
entirely missing from this workout I
assume it's only working on calves and
uh yeah cabs huh all right
especially with me all these injuries
over the years she's in the water really
just like it really just keeps my joints
uh being underwater does reduce the load
on the joints almost 100 which is cool
and if you are if your knees hurt the
ankles hurt getting some swimming it is
good I will say one warning about
swimming if you're trying to use
swimming for weight loss don't
because in swimming we see something
called the cold water effect whereby if
you are merged and swimming in a pool
even if you're exercising even if your
heart rate is up afterwards only with
swimming because of the cold water
effect you get way hungrier than normal
and that's much harder to keep a low
calorie diet to get yourself in savior
China do some fat loss and weight loss I
probably would include better cardio
than swimming like anything else but he
looks lean enough to me you heard me so
lean enough for me to look at I'll see
myself
dumbbell circuit you already know this
is going to be a terrible work 10 sets
start at 10 and work our way down so
first set is 10 second set is nine ten
nine eight yeah so that's a fine way to
do things because your body accumulates
fatigue and the training has to get
easier you're going to be strongest and
most able to do higher reps when you're
fresh and that will degrade so it's a
great way to accommodate I will say that
the 10987 ETC et cetera linear scale
doesn't accommodate how your body
actually fatigues your body tends to
fatigue a lot at first and then much
less later so with this kind of
situation you're going to have to really
be easy on the first couple of sets
which is that idea because you're just
pissing away energy while you're most
fresh should be going hard at first so I
prefer more of something like a 10 8 6 5
4 4 4 or something like that but I'm
just being a picky oh wait I'm a
professor of sports science that's my
job dumbbell curls I mean that's just
great for conditioning you know for
explosion dumbbell curls not good for
conditioning or explosion it is good for
making your biceps bigger which is
arguably much more important than either
one of those two things his technique is
fine he could have his elbows up a
little in front of them a little forward
or stretch them back even further it's
kind of this awkward double elbow Bend
he's got going on it's like he's faking
the curl I'm not saying he is just kind
of looks
clearly the way it's really light so
that's good I guess you know your arms
usually are one of the stronger parts of
of your body so the biceps are one of
the weakest muscles in your body they
are not one of the strongest parts of
your body almost every muscle is
stronger than your biceps
you can curl more than you can leg press
or deadlift or pull up or raw or
anything else you have a problem
it's really easy for me to do though he
said it's easy for me to do the bicep
curls because it's one of the strongest
muscles of the body hey I got a
suggestion and guys this is all in good
faith it's all for fun it's all comedy
use more weight using the
20s saying that is easier
you know doing overhead dumbbell press
and I'll show the presses are are okay
so that's a push press because he's he's
using leg drive it's a cool movement
um you know you can do more reps and
more load it's not the best movement for
muscle growth because you're using a lot
of leg drive and stuff and that tends to
fatigue you more but for overall calorie
burning and fitness a fine Choice Men's
Health says uh you know warning keep
your abs tight don't arch your back uh
there's nothing wrong with arching your
back on the shoulder press at all
competitive lifters have been done it
for Generations
um and if you stay too upright it
actually makes it a much more Awkward
movement so to the people at Men's
Health that don't actually lift weights
thank you so much I'm kidding
I've been working so much so on his bent
row technique he's going up quickly
which is nice but he's also going down
quickly if you want more muscle growth
you're going to go down more slowly and
under control and really get a deep
stretch at the bottom that'll grow more
muscle it'll be more challenging for you
but you're working out to get a
challenge because you want the best
results so don't rush so to transform
myself physically and mentally was uh
was the goal you know I trained with
veterans from the Army from the Navy
Seals folks I'm going to say this a
couple more times over the duration of
this series when you're training to play
a Navy SEAL
you absolutely can transform yourself
externally physically to look like a
Navy SEAL not terribly difficult Navy
Seals are just guys in pretty good shape
externally your mentality will not
approach that of a Navy SEAL that is
impossible to do for two reasons one
most of us do not have the genetics to
be mentally as hard as the Navy Seals no
no I pause almost none of us have that
and secondarily you have to do Navy SEAL
training to get that I'll see you
at bugs
doing some
literally bent over rows with 20 pound
dumbbells by the side of your beach
house and Saint Arts is not going to get
you the mentality of a Navy SEAL and I
know that sounds crazy
Hollywood just act Act is
pretend it's Gotta finish doing a little
mini circuit kind of dumbbells
so far we've trained
biceps to some extent triceps
front delts traps and the back
no chest yet no side dealts no ABS or
sure those are coming and no legs at all
we'll see what's happening next boss
lands are definitely something that I
really really enjoy doing it really
allows me to like let out a lot of
aggression you know it's really good to
let out a lot of aggression you know
what I'm saying when I'm vacationing in
my private Villa in Saint Barts you boys
got that crazy aggression you heard me
like I'm on these streets and by streets
I mean my own beach house in Paradise
that being the case the medicine ball
slam is a very good tool for developing
the athletic ability to contract your
entire anterior chain all the way from
your arms down to your front of your
calves and especially with the hip
flexors and the ABS the problem is it's
a very bad way to grow your abs to make
them all six Packy and sexy because it
skips The Eccentric the lengthening
component which almost every other ab
exercise the normal stuff like leg lifts
and crunches and machine abs that they
do so well this skips entirely so
medicine ball slams for as much work as
you're putting into it unless you're a
specific kind of athlete and a specific
power generating phase of their training
is uh just not the best way to train for
pretty much the only thing that Michael
B Jordan would want to train for which
is appearance
battle rules battle ropes is a lot of
fun also because it just Okay I lied
battle ropes aren't fun for the 500th
Time battle ropes is one of the stupid
exercises ever invented it trains almost
nothing it trains the aerobic and
possibly glycolytic ability to use your
biceps triceps shoulders and back a
little bit not through a full range of
motion to grow minimal amount of muscle
battle ropes makes you better at doing
this
which is actually not terrible ancillary
training for something like boxing not
terrible but again Michael B Jordan's
not a real boxer either I know it's
crazy
40 seconds that minute that minute and a
half that you're that you're going all
out it really um
you really feel they're working you can
tell Michael B Jordan has Dick to say
about any of this he's like yeah yeah
like
you know 40 seconds a minute
 fellas minute and a half yo watch
this you wanna watch me work minute 55
up in this homies oh no no no shut up
two minutes everyone's like oh Are
you serious bro that's how we roll St
Bart streets you're just cooling down
and resting your mind I think is
extremely important I love the Eastern
theme song they got playing in the
background just in case you were
confused as a where meditation comes
from the East damn look at that fly ass
suit
Scott's video you gotta include this
scene
 is on fire bro why don't I dress
like Michael B Jordan
I will say he never actually did train
his chest
and he trained
all of his muscles with a tiny amount of
volume so overall and if you do this
workout to try to look like Michael B
Jordan you will be
will be seemingly disappointed
I have a better workout save up your
money for a while a while
get you a plane ticket to Saint Barth
that is dope as hell
St Barnes 9.5 out of 10. I could be
Jordan's workout
three out of ten see you guys next time
