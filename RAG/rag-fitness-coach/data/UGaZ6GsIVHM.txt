short rests or long rests which is
better for maximizing muscle growth
traditionally short rest intervals were
believed to be optimal for building
muscle
indeed a 1987 study by kramer and
colleagues
found that bodybuilders used around 10
to 90 seconds of rest between sets
this was in contrast to power lifters
who rested around 120
to 140 seconds between sets even today
if you follow any social media general
fitness pages
or have read any classic personal
training textbooks you may have come
across the notion that shorter rest
periods
are superior for building muscle whereas
longer rest periods
are better for building strength the
idea shorter rest
intervals are superior for muscle growth
thus have origins in scientific research
research has shown that when using
shorter rest intervals
anabolic hormones mainly growth hormone
are elevated
significantly more than using longer
rest intervals
it speculated this greater acute
elevation in anabolic hormones
would result in greater muscle growth
however
we cannot necessarily assume just
because something induces a greater
acute hormonal response
it will cause greater muscle growth
interestingly
when looking at the current research
greater acute anabolic hormone
elevations
do not appear to be correlated to muscle
growth as a result the idea that shorter
rest intervals produce greater muscle
growth
due to the greater acute hormonal
response is not supported
opposed to the research assessing the
acute hormonal responses
to various rest intervals it would be
much better to look at research
assessing measures of muscle growth
before and after a set duration in
groups using different rest intervals
let us evaluate this research for
compound exercises
the weight of the current evidence
suggests that longer rest intervals
may be superior to shorter rest
intervals for building muscle
compound exercises involve the movement
of
two or more joints resulting in multiple
muscle groups being trained
examples include the back score bench
press
deadlift barbell row overhead press
and many more let's briefly overview the
research on compound
exercises and rest intervals
longo and colleagues had 28 untrained
individuals
perform leg presses for three sets to
failure which is the point at which no
more repetitions can be performed with
an eighty percent one rep max load
twice per week for ten weeks increases
in quadriceps cross-sectional area
were superior when resting for three
minutes between sets
compared to resting one minute between
sets
schoenfeld and colleagues had 13 men
with at least six months of training
experience
perform a range of exercises each for
three sets to failure
with an 8 to 12 rep max load three times
per week for eight weeks
the exercises were the back squat leg
press
leg extension bench press overhead press
lat pull down and cable row except for
the leg extension
all of these exercises are compound
increases in elbow flexor
triceps brachii anterior quadriceps
and vastus lateralis thickness favored
the group resting for three minutes
compared to the group resting for one
minute between sets
baresh and colleagues split 12 men with
some training experience
but not in the three months before the
study into a group resting 2.5 minutes
between sets
or a group resting one minute between
sets both groups trained four times per
week
for 10 weeks with workout 1 and workout
2
each repeated twice per week a range of
compound
exercises were used the group resting
2.5 minutes between sets
experienced greater increases in thigh
and arm cross-sectional area
fink and colleagues split 14 untrained
individuals
into a group resting 2.5 minutes between
sets
or a group resting 30 seconds between
sets
both groups train the bench press and
back squat
for four sets to failure with a 40 one
rep max load
twice per week for eight weeks you may
be questioning the
percent one rep max load however for
hypertrophy
this is perfectly fine the current
evidence suggests that loads between 30
percent
and 85 percent warn rep max produce
similar hypertrophy
provided reps are performed to failure
increases in triceps cross-sectional
area
were similar between both groups but
increases in thigh cross-sectional area
favored the group resting 2.5 minutes
between sets
there actually is one paper finding
shorter rest intervals
to be superior for muscle growth with
compound exercises
villanova and colleagues split 22
untrained elderly men
their average age was 68 years old into
a group resting four minutes between
sets or a group resting one minute
between sets
both groups perform the leg press
machine chest press
lat pull down seated row dumbbell
step-ups
dumbbell romanian deadlifts knee
extensions
and leg curls for two to three sets
with 46 reps three times per week
for eight weeks increases in lean body
mass
were superior for the group resting one
minute between sets
however this study does have limitations
the subjects were elderly men later
we'll explore how age impacts recovery
between sets
but more importantly volume load the
product of sets times reps times
load was equated between the one minute
rest group
and the four minute rest group this
would have meant
that the one minute rest group was
training closer to failure
to illustrate this let's say your one
route max on the bench press is 100
kilograms
and you had to perform three sets of
eight reps with 75 kilograms
which would be more difficult resting
one minute between
sets or resting four minutes between
sets of course
resting one minute between sets would be
harder as you would be training closer
to failure on your subsequent sets
thanks to the decreased recovery time
therefore
it's unclear what the result of the
villanova and quality study would look
like if both the one-minute rest group
and four-minute rest group
took their sets to failure remember
the four studies we have looked at so
far finding greater hypertrophy for
longer rest intervals
had subjects take their sets to or close
to
failure so the current evidence suggests
that when subjects
train with the same program and
proximity to failure
longer rest intervals so 2.5 to 3
minutes
seems to produce greater hypertrophy
than shorter rest intervals
one minute or less with compound
exercises
the same training program detail is
worth elaborating on
the same training program would imply
that a longer rest group
and a shorter risk group perform the
same number of sets
on their exercises there is some
evidence suggesting that if you use
shorter rest intervals
performing more sets may be compensatory
meaning that more
sets and shorter rest intervals could
produce similar hypertrophy
to fewer sets and longer rest intervals
returning to the longer and colleague
study they found that when subjects
trained twice per week
for 10 weeks performing four to five
sets
to failure on the leg press with an
eighty percent one remax
load and one minute of rest between sets
produce similar increases in quadriceps
cross-sectional area
to performing three sets to failure on
the leg press with an eighty percent one
rep max
load and three minutes of rest between
sets
italian and colleagues found that
resting two minutes between sets
produced similar increases in quadriceps
cross-sectional area
to resting five minutes between sets
when participants performed an average
one more set when resting two minutes
between sets although
two minutes of rest between sets would
not be seen as a short rest interval to
many people
another way one could potentially
interpret this study
is that despite the more sets two
minutes of rest between sets could be
sufficient
and resting for longer may not be
required unfortunately
there currently isn't any other papers
comparing two minutes or rest between
sets
to other longer rest intervals for
hypertrophy as a result
we can only conclude that based on the
current evidence
with all else equal longer rest
intervals
so 2.5 to 3 minutes produce greater
hypertrophy than shorter rest intervals
of one minute or less
with compound exercises however when all
else is not equal this might not be the
case
specifically performing one or two more
sets with shorter rest intervals
may be able to produce similar
hypertrophy to longer rest intervals
unfortunately with isolation exercises
the evidence is less clear on how long
you should rest
isolation exercises primarily involve
movement at one joint resulting in
primarily one muscle group
being trained examples include bicep
curls
triceps push downs lateral raises leg
extensions
leg curls and many more returning to the
baresh and colleague study
a range of isolation exercises were used
as already mentioned
increases in arm and thigh cross
sectional area
were greater for the group resting 2.5
minutes between sets
compared to the group resting one minute
between sets therefore
this study implies longer rest intervals
are also favorable with isolation
movements
however it could be argued that the use
of compound exercises in the study
somewhat confounded our ability to truly
deduce if longer rest intervals are
better with isolation movements
what about the research evaluating rest
intervals with isolation exercises
exclusively
fink and colleagues had 22 individuals
perform bicep curls
preacher curls hammer curls close grip
bench presses
tricep skull crushers and dumbbell
extensions
except for the close grip bench press
all of these exercises are isolation
but the close grip bench press was used
to isolate the triceps
so this is not really a problem the
researchers had one group perform these
exercises with a 20 rep max load
and 30 seconds of rest between sets and
another group performed them with an 8
rep max
load and 3 minutes of rest between sets
both groups took their sets to failure
and performed the same number of sets
for some reason
the paper did not state the number of
sets performed both groups trained twice
per week
for eight weeks increases in arm cross
sectional area
favored the group using a 20 rep max
load and 30 seconds of rest between
sets therefore this study suggests that
with isolation exercises
shorter rest intervals may be superior
load was not controlled
the group that rested 30 seconds between
sets used a 20 rep max load
while the group that rested 3 minutes
between sets used an 8 rep max load
it could be argued that this somewhat
confounded the study
recall earlier i mentioned that the
current evidence suggests that loads
between 30
and 85 percent of one rep max produce
similar growth when reps are performed
to failure
this would imply that the use of
different loads should not matter
another study by okazi and colleagues
assigned to each arm of nine untrained
men
into one of three conditions three sets
to failure with an eighty percent one
rare max
load and three minutes of rest between
sets
three sets to failure with a thirty
percent one rate max load
and ninety seconds or rest between sets
or a drop set condition
the drop set condition had the arm
perform an initial set to failure
with an eighty percent one rep max load
immediately after
they performed four drop sets to failure
starting with a sixty five percent one
rep max
load then a fifty percent one rep max
load
then a forty percent one ramx load and
finally a thirty percent one rep max
load
all three conditions involve training
the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl
two to three times per week for eight
weeks
increases in cross-sectional area of the
elbow flexors
which included the biceps braca and
brachialis were similar between
all three conditions therefore this
study implies that with isolation
exercises
rest intervals may not matter at all not
only did
three minutes of rest produce similar
growth to 90 seconds of rest
but virtually no rest between sets the
drop set condition
was not any worse now
the drop set condition did technically
perform five sets
which is two more than the other two
conditions more sets generally result in
more growth
and so this could have helped out the
drop set condition so
the current evidence is completely
conflicting with regards to rest
intervals
and isolation exercises with one paper
finding
longer rest intervals to be superior
another finding shorter rest intervals
to be superior
and even one finding no differences
between various rest intervals
to mighty the waters even further there
is one paper finding drop set training
so no rest between sets to be superior
to traditional training
for hypertrophy with an isolation
exercise
finke and colleagues split 16 men
untrained in the last year into a normal
set group
or a drop set group both groups trained
the triceps push down
twice per week for eight weeks the drop
set group performed a single set to
failure
with a 12 rep max load immediately
decreasing the load by 20
each time failure was reached three
times in a row
the normal set group performed three
sets to failure with a 12 rep max
load and 90 seconds of rest between sets
increases in triceps cross-sectional
area favored the drop set group
in this study the drop set group did
technically perform one more set
than the normal set group similar to the
ocassion colleague study
this could have helped out the drop set
condition
given the conflicting evidence we don't
really have any grounds to conclude
if shorter rest intervals or longer rest
intervals
are better for hypertrophy with
isolation exercises
i think it's sensible to suggest that
one should aim to rest however long they
feel
is comfortable and practical with these
movements
although we were unable to conclude if
longer
or shorter rest intervals are preferred
with isolation exercises
we did conclude that with compound
exercises
longer rest intervals appear to be
favorable why might
longer rest intervals produce greater
hypertrophy with
compound exercises some researchers have
suggested this is because
longer rest intervals allow for a higher
volume load
the product of sets times reps times
load for instance
in the already mentioned longo and
colleague study
they measured the volume load completed
over the 10 week duration
in the two conditions performing three
sets on the leg press
twice per week for 10 weeks total volume
load was higher in the condition that
arrested three minutes between sets
versus the condition that arrested one
minute between sets
the authors contended that this higher
volume load accumulated with the three
minute rest condition
explained the greater increases in
quadriceps cross-sectional area
observed for this condition however this
assumes that higher volume loads result
in more growth
when overviewing the research this isn't
the case
to be clear volume in the form of weekly
sets
is related to hypertrophy for instance
a meta-analysis by schoenfeld and
colleagues found that with all else
equal
the more sets that are two or close to
failure
performed per week the greater the
muscle growth
but the number of weekly sets that are
too
close to failure and volume load is not
the same thing
remember in the longer and colleague
study both the three minute rest
condition
and one minute rest condition involve
three sets to failure
on the leg press each session but as
just mentioned
volume load was higher for the three
minute rest condition
here's the important point we have
strong evidence
volume load is unrelated to muscle
growth
this comes from research on rep ranges
as
already mentioned loads between 30
percent
and 85 percent one rep max appear to
produce similar muscle growth
provided reps are taken to failure based
on this
three sets to failure with an eighty
percent one rep max load
should produce similar muscle growth to
performing three sets to failure with a
sixty percent one rate max load
let's say an individual's warner max is
100 kilograms on an exercise
when performing three sets to failure
with an 80 one rep max
load so 80 kilograms assuming a longer
rest interval
we might expect them to get seven reps
on the first set
six reps on the second set and five reps
on the final set
this would give us a volume load of four
thousand three hundred and twenty
kilograms
when performing three sets to failure
with a sixty percent one rep max
load so 60 kilograms providing a longer
rest interval
we might expect them to get 15 reps on
the first set
13 reps on the second set and 11 reps on
the final set
this would give us a volume load of
seven thousand and twenty kilograms
if volume load was an indicator of
muscle growth
we would expect three sets with a sixty
percent one rep max load
to produce greater hypertrophy than
three sets with an eighty percent one
rep max load
but from the research on rep ranges both
protocols would probably produce similar
hypertrophy
therefore the idea that longer rest
intervals produce greater hypertrophy
because they enable higher volume loads
cannot be true
moreover if volume load was the reason
why would this not apply to isolation
exercises
longer rest intervals would allow a
greater volume load with isolation
exercises
yet as established the research on rest
intervals and isolation
exercises is conflicting a stronger
hypothesis behind why longer rest
intervals appear to produce greater
hypertrophy with compound exercises
relates to central fatigue i must credit
chris beardsley
eric helms and james krieger from where
i initially came across this hypothesis
it was their work that inspired me to
research this area much further
to understand this hypothesis we need to
understand
central fatigue the reason muscles
produce force
is because they receive signals
originating from the central nervous
system
the central nervous system consists of
the brain
and spinal cord there are two neurons
involved here
an upper motor neuron and a lower motor
neuron
upper motor neurons originate in the
cerebral cortex
which is the outer layer of the cerebrum
the cerebrum refers to the two
hemispheres of the brain
upper motor neurons mostly end at a
region in the spinal cord
lower motor neurons mostly start at a
region in the spinal cord
and end at a particular muscle upper
motor neurons transmit electrical
signals to lower motor neurons
which relay this signal to a muscle
causing muscle contraction
central fatigue refers to a decrease in
these electrical signals to the muscle
[Music]
at the level of the muscle this means
that not only do the recruited muscle
fibers produce
less force but fewer muscle fibers are
recruited overall
this is the opposite of what we want for
maximizing muscle growth
we want high levels of muscle fiber
recruitment and high levels of force
produced by each
of those recruited muscle fibers during
a set on an exercise
two or close to failure central fatigue
likely develops
there are numerous potential mechanisms
behind how central fatigue occurs during
exercise
one particular mechanism that is linked
to hypertrophy training sets
is afferent feedback afferents are
neurons that transmit information from
organs
to the central nervous system there are
sensory neurons
linking muscles to the central nervous
system two of these
group three afferents and group four
afferents have been associated with
central fatigue
group three afferents are primarily
sensitive to strong levels of muscle
contraction
but they do also appear to respond to
the build up of metabolites
group 4 afferents are primarily
sensitive to the buildup of metabolites
within the muscle
but they do also appear to respond to
strong levels of muscle contraction
just to be clear the build-up of
metabolites refers to the increase of
various products
linked to chemical reactions in the
muscle such as lactate
inorganic phosphate and hydrogen ions
when training to or close to failure the
majority
of a muscle's fibers would be producing
strong contractions
additionally the buildup of metabolites
likely occurs too
especially during higher repetition sets
in response to these conditions
group 3 and group 4 afferents can
directly
or indirectly reduce the electrical
signal sent down by lower motor neurons
[Music]
this means less force production from
recruited muscle fibers
as well as a reduction in the overall
muscle fibers recruited
which as established is what we do not
want
it's impossible to remove central
fatigue during our sets
however we would want to begin our next
set
once this central fatigue has
disappeared and this is the basis of the
hypothesis
it's believed longer rest intervals
would make it less likely
for us to begin a set when central
fatigue is still present
however why would this particular
argument only apply to compound
and not isolation exercises
some evidence indirectly implies that
the more muscle mass involved in an
exercise
the greater the central fatigue
generated because compound exercises
involve a greater amount of muscle mass
compared to isolation exercises this
would imply that sets of compound
exercises
produce greater central fatigue and thus
require longer rest intervals compared
to isolation exercises
but i have come across research opposing
this central fatigue hypothesis
a review paper by weevil and colleagues
actually suggests that the less muscle
mass in an exercise
the greater the central fatigue
generated an isometric unilateral elbow
flexion contraction
produced greater central fatigue than
unilateral knee extensions
these knee extensions also produce
greater central fatigue than cycling
out of these three modes of exercise
cycling
involves the greatest amount of muscle
mass followed by unilateral knee
extensions
and then unilateral elbow flexion
contractions
furthermore as far as i'm aware there
are no
studies investigating how quickly
central fatigue disappears
after sets of typical weight training
exercises
but there is indirect data that would
imply central fatigue disappears fairly
rapidly
kennedy and colleagues had subjects
perform a maximum voluntary contraction
of the quadriceps for two minutes
immediately after
there were minimal signs of central
fatigue another study by kennedy and
colleagues
had subjects perform a two-minute
maximum voluntary contraction
of the adductor pollicis which is a
muscle of the hand
central fatigue had almost fully
dissipated after one minute of rest
todd and colleagues had subjects perform
a two-minute maximum voluntary
contraction
for the elbow flexors central fatigue
had dissipated within 30 seconds of
completing the exercise
of course these protocols are not
identical to sets with typical weight
training exercises
most exercises are performed with a
concentric and eccentric phase
while the mentioned studies involved
maximum isometric contractions
moreover all of these studies involve
two-minute contractions
most typical sets last far less than two
minutes
this is an important point there seems
to be a belief that heavier loads
and therefore shorter set durations
cause the most
central fatigue however this is a
misconception
lighter loads and therefore longer
duration sets
seem to cause greater central fatigue
this study had subjects perform an
isometric contraction with their
quadriceps
for 33 straight minutes at 15 percent of
their maximum voluntary isometric
contraction strength
the authors noted central fatigue
dissipated within three
to nine minutes after this protocol
another study had subjects perform an
isometric contraction with their elbow
flexors
for 43 straight minutes at 15 percent of
their maximum voluntary isometric
contraction
central fatigue took roughly 20 minutes
to disappear
smith and colleagues had subjects
perform an isometric contraction with
their elbow flexors
for 70 straight minutes at five percent
of their maximum voluntary isometric
contraction
30 minutes after finishing this central
fatigue was still present
they did not take any further
measurements after these 30 minutes
so we do not know when central fatigue
fully dissipated
therefore given typical hypertrophy sets
are generally shorter in duration than
two minutes
their indirect evidence would suggest
that central fatigue should disappear
quicker than the values we saw for the
various two-minute isometric
contractions
potentially implying that central
fatigue disappears after 30 seconds
or less of typical hypertrophy sets
but as we saw with the research 2.5 to 3
minute rest intervals produced greater
hypertrophy than one minute or less
with compound exercises as a result
there seems to be a potential flaw with
the central fatigue hypothesis
i should note the research we have
looked at assessing how long it takes
for central fatigue to disappear
used isometric contractions for only one
muscle group
essentially meaning they are isolation
exercises
but remember although there is some
indirect evidence suggesting compound
exercises could induce
greater central fatigue than isolation
exercises
the review paper by weevil and
colleagues suggests
otherwise at the end of the day to truly
know if central fatigue could be the
reason behind why
longer rest intervals are superior with
compound exercises
we would need research assessing how
long central fatigue takes to disappear
after various sets with compound
exercises as well as isolation exercises
aside from distinguishing between
compound and isolation exercises
it's often overlooked that sex age
and even your current strength levels
can play a role in determining the
duration of rest intervals
most of the studies looked at so far had
men as their subjects
though a few studies did have both men
and women as their subjects
but this clouds our ability to draw out
any potential differences between men
and women
some evidence suggests women may be able
to recover quicker between
sets compared to men rata mess and
colleagues
recruited 22 men and women with at least
one year of training experience
the subjects performed three sets on the
bench press with a 75
one rep max load on three separate
occasions they perform this protocol
with either one minute
two minute or three minutes of rest
between sets
the subjects were encouraged to perform
10 reps per set
looking at the results regardless of the
rest interval used
women performed a higher number of reps
over the three sets compared to the men
indicating they had a greater recovery
ability other studies also have similar
findings
however the authors noted that when they
adjusted for bench press strength
there was no difference in repetition
performance between men and women over
the three sets
this would suggest that gender per se
did not explain the faster recovery
rather it appears your strength level
impacts how quickly you recover
in other words the weaker you are on an
exercise
the quicker your performance can recover
conversely
the stronger you are on an exercise the
longer it would take for your
performance to recover
in this study the woman's average bench
press one rep max was 36 kilograms
while the men's average bench press
warner at max was 112 kilograms
given the women were weaker than the men
in this study
this seemed to explain why they were
better able to sustain their repetitions
from set to set
to further test this idea the
researchers had a second part of the
study
22 men were split into a low one rep max
group
or a high one rep max group on average
the low one rep max group's bench press
was 81 kilograms
while the high one rep max group's bench
press was 141 kilograms
the subjects performed three sets on the
bench press with a 75
one rep max load on three separate
occasions
they performed this with either one
minute two minutes
or three minutes of rest between sets
the subjects were encouraged to perform
10 reps per set
looking at the results regardless of the
rest interval used
the low warner max group were able to
sustain their repetitions across the
three sets
better than the high warner max group
therefore
regardless if you're a man or woman the
weaker you are
on an exercise the faster you can
probably recover between sets of that
exercise
and so your rest intervals need not be
excessive here
having said all of this there is other
evidence suggesting that when women and
men are matched for strength
women are still able to recover faster
philco
and colleagues match nine men and nine
women for strength of their doctor
policies
the researchers had subjects perform a
fatiguing isometric contraction of their
doctor pollicis
one minute after this the woman had
recovered to 71
of their baseline strength while the men
only recovered to 65
of their baseline strength research
comparing various physiological
and anatomical differences between men
and women also support the idea women
may intrinsically have the ability to
recover quicker between sets
some evidence indicates women have
greater blood flow than men
greater blood flow to the muscle would
accelerate the recovery process between
sets additionally some evidence suggests
that women have a higher proportional
area of type 1 muscle fibers
compared to men type 1 fibers
often called slow twitch muscle fibers
have faster recovery abilities
and are more fatigue resistant compared
to type 2 fibers
which are often called fast twitch
muscle fibers based on this
woman would not only be able to recover
quicker between sets
but each set would also generate less
fatigue
so irrespective of whether their
exercise is isolation or compound
women can probably rest shorter than men
would without any problem
although we could not conclude anything
with isolation exercises
we did conclude that with compound
exercises 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest
between
sets was superior to shorter durations
but this conclusion was from studies
that mainly involved men
women may be able to get away with
resting one to two minutes between sets
of compound exercises
[Music]
all but one of the studies assessed so
far have focused on young men and women
two studies suggest that elderly men and
women
may be able to recover faster between
sets than younger men and women
theo and colleagues recruited 20 young
women
between 20 and 30 years old and 16
elderly women
between 60 and 80 years old the
researchers had these subjects performed
three sets with an eight rep max of load
on an isokinetic dynamometer designed to
provide knee extension
and knee flexion resistance on three
different days
they performed this with either 15
seconds 30 seconds
or 60 seconds of rest between sets
for both the young and elderly women 60
seconds of rest resulted in the
maintenance of knee extension torque
throughout the three sets while the 30
and 15 second rest intervals
did not neither the young or old woman
were able to maintain knee flexor torque
across the three sets with 15 seconds of
rest between sets
but both were able to maintain knee
flexor torque with 60 seconds of rest
between sets
but the elderly woman were also able to
maintain knee flexor torque
throughout the three sets with 30
seconds of rest between
sets this implies that for the elderly
30 seconds of rest between sets was
sufficient to recover knee flexion talk
whereas the younger woman required 60
seconds of rest between
sets therefore this study partially
supports the idea that elderly women
may be able to recover quicker between
sets compared to younger women
another study by botaro and colleagues
recruited 17 young men
their average age was 25 years old and
20 elderly men
their average age was 66 years old the
subjects performed knee extensions for 3
sets of 10 reps
on two separate occasions they performed
this with either 60 seconds
or 120 seconds of rest between sets
with both rest intervals the young men
experienced a greater decline in peak
knee extension torque
across the three sets compared to the
elderly men indicating the elderly men
had a quicker recovery between their
sets
in the two studies the elderly subjects
were weaker compared to the younger
subjects
as discussed already this strength
difference likely would partly explain
why the elderly may be able to recover
quicker between
sets however there is also evidence that
with aging
there is a decrease in the size of type
2 muscle fibers and an increase in the
proportion of type 1 muscle fibers
as mentioned type 1 fibers have quicker
recovery abilities
and are more fatigue resistant compared
to type 2 fibers
this would be another potential reason
behind why the elderly may be able to
recover quicker between sets compared to
the young
when we looked at the research on
compound exercises and muscle growth
the study by villanova and colleagues
was conducted on elderly men
the average age was 68 years old
increases in lean body mass were greater
for the group resting one minute between
sets
compared to the group resting four
minutes between sets on the face of it
this would support the idea that the
elderly can successfully use shorter
rest intervals
but recall volume load was equated
between the two groups
meaning the one minute rest group would
have been training closer to failure
than the 4-minute risk group therefore
it's unclear how this study would
conclude
if both groups took their sets to
failure
so more research would be required to
truly get an idea of what rest intervals
promote greater hypertrophy
in the elderly ultimately from the acute
research the elderly can probably
wrestle less between their sets compared
to the young
with isolation exercises the only
sensible advice to give based on the
current evidence
would be to select a rest interval the
elderly may find comfortable
and practical for compound exercises
given the majority of the evidence
implies that 2.5
to 3 minutes of rest between sets
produces greater hypertrophy than
shorter restorations
in young men it could be assumed that
the elderly may be able to achieve
optimal muscle growth with a rest
interval shorter than this
perhaps one to two minutes of rest
between sets of compound exercises
is sufficient

there is some evidence that a person
could over time
slowly decrease the duration of their
rest intervals
without compromising muscle hypertrophy
de souza and colleagues
split 20 men with at least one year of
training experience
into a constant rest group or a
decreasing rest group
both groups trained six days per week
for eight weeks
for the first two weeks both groups
trained identically
they performed all exercises for three
sets with a 10 to 12 rep max
load and two minutes of rest between
sets workout 1
and workout 2 were each performed 3
times per week
from weeks 3 to 8 both groups performed
each exercise for 4 sets
with an 8 to 10 rep max load but their
rest intervals differed
their weekly workout schedule also
changed
the constant rest group continued using
two minutes of rest between
sets the decreasing risk group
throughout these six
weeks gradually decreased the duration
of their rest intervals weekly from 105
seconds
to 30 seconds of rest between sets
after the 8 weeks increases in thigh
and arm cross sectional area were
similar between both groups
put differently gradually decreasing
your rest duration
week to week appeared to not compromise
muscle growth
in comparison to a group consistently
resting two minutes between sets
a range of compound and isolation
exercises were performed by both groups
returning to our findings much earlier
the research is conflicting on whether
long
or short rest intervals are optimal with
isolation exercises
but with compound exercises 2.5 to 3
minutes of rest between sets
produced greater increases in muscle
hypertrophy
versus shorter rest durations based on
this information
you could argue that the constant rest
group was not resting optimally anyway
as they rested only 2 minutes between
sets given 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest is
preferred for compound exercises
we cannot truly conclude that gradually
decreasing rest intervals
does not compromise muscle growth at the
same time though
it's important to consider that the
conclusion 2.5 to 3 minutes or rest is
preferred for compound
exercises comes from research comparing
this rest interval
to durations of one minute or less it's
possible
that when comparing 2.5 to 3 minutes of
rest
to 2 minutes or rest between sets with
compound
exercises there would be no difference
in muscle growth
but there is no research assessing this
hopefully future research looks at this
so although the preliminary evidence on
the use of decreasing rest intervals is
somewhat promising
more evidence is still most definitely
required
also once an individual has reached a
short rest interval
and decides to maintain this rest
interval it's not clear how this would
compare to someone using a longer rest
interval
in the long term for example in the
dasosa and quality study
the decreasing rest group used 30
seconds of rest between sets
in their final week what if they
maintain this rest interval
for say the next 10 weeks would
increases in
arm and thigh cross-sectional area still
be similar to the constant rest group
using a two-minute rest interval
again future research would be needed to
address this question
