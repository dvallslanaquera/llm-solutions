hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and today's BS topic is
the claim the idea the notion even that
red meat is bad for your health terrible
in fact
if you guys remember that one time that
the denizens of a peaceful city were
just living their lives and then one of
the kids looked up and he goes gee whiz
what's that dad and dad looks over in a
giant piece of red meat
boom hits the Central Bank skyscraper
building and it falls crushing puppies
and children
one of the children's heads roles right
under the kids
feet and he looks down and the kids got
one eye missing and the jaw's all fucked
up and he's like Ah that's basically
what red meat does but to your body
so claim some folks
here's the thing
as a scientific Community we did suspect
that red meat was bad for health back in
the 80s and 90s
and less and less the scientific
community and more and more like the
popular Health Community like people
that write major media magazines like
it's a real great piece for Time
Magazine like
is your dinner table a murder scene like
not as of yesterday but how how could
this be read this magazine here 1988 red
meat is killing your children you're
like oh that's terrible and they're made
of red meat the irony
however
the way we got to know that was from
huge data sets
on tons and tons of people that listed a
ton of their different habits and
Lifestyles and also enlisted their red
meat consumption
and at first on average the people who
consumed more red meat
seem to have higher rates of strokes and
diabetes and obesity and heart disease
and
gee whiz you know all kinds of bad stuff
and uh some people thought many people
thought holy crap like red meat's bad
but remember this is only correlation
and this was not adjusted for the
recalled confounders
lurking variables that could actually be
causing the difference but making it
seem that the difference is caused by
whatever you focused on like red meat
because it turns out
some of these other things may be
contributing to the health maladies that
red meat eaters actually experienced
because it turns out that people who eat
more red meat on average
also tended to exhibit some other sorts
of behaviors for example red meat eaters
also seem to smoke more more often
and bigger cigarettes too I'm kidding I
think cigarettes are all the same size
never smoked a cigarette
that didn't have weed in it you feel me
family
your boy's on it not right now not at
work but probably in about 45 minutes in
any case
people who eat a lot of red meat seem to
smoke more at least back in the 80s 90s
did it
they drink more sweet diet they hate
children and flowers and peace and their
pro-war and all this other bad stuff
so but maybe it's the smoking and
drinking and the otherwise unhealthy
behaviors by the way they also tend to
exercise less
I don't think red meat's causing them to
do all these things
and red meat might be the thing that was
actually hurting their health but gee
whizzy like we know for sure smoking
isn't good for you we know drinking past
a very small several you know one to two
drinks a day a few times a week is bad
and if you drink much more it's really
bad and it's shown that people that
drink a lot and smoke a lot
um
G like they really ate a lot of junk
food too and also they had more red meat
just think of like
not an actual truck driver but a
stereotype the worst one you can think
of of a truck driver yeah man I'm a
truck and cigarette gas tank
alcohol I'm still driving fuck it and
steak raw bloody ah that was great and
then chicken nuggets clearly fries
you get the picture unhealthy behaviors
tend to correlate at least somewhat with
red meat consumption so how do we know
if it's the red meat causing the
troubles or if it's all this other bad
stuff that's associated with
right
so good news since the 80s and 90s are
data sets have multiplied in how many
people are being analyzed and how many
different life variables we're asking
people about it's not just like hey D
red meat how much
how much junk food do you eat do you
smoke do you drink how much fuck out of
here that's our study ooh we got tons of
other stuff
exercise how many vegetables and fruits
they eat
stress
pharmacology use
Etc
and our statistics that we have are now
superpowered a lot of these studies in
the 80s and 90s if you want to do some
real hardcore stats you know how to
program nobody knew how to program
basically a lot of the stuff you'd have
to do kind of by hand and nowadays
statistical software is like ubiquitous
and Ultra powerful
man when I was learning staff some of
the shit I had to really
because I learned stats when I was
younger younger and then I had to
relearn them later with uh the new
software and it was like you know do you
want this test to account for sphericity
I was like what the fuck is ferocity
holy shit I must been dead for a few
years came back they changed stats but
in any case
I ended up learning a lot of that stuff
stats are really really great now at
taking all the data together
you say Okay I want to see what is the
correlation of red meat consumption
but I have a hundred other variables
that I've also studied and I want you
statistically Mr computer to remove them
out of the equation so to speak so that
I can just see the relationship of colon
cancer heart disease blah blah blah
Health stuff just with red meat because
we know that red meat eaters also tend
to smoke more
and that affects health so if we
statistically adjust for cigarette
smoking and say okay but for red meat
eaters that don't smoke more so to speak
are they at a higher likelihood of all
these other bad diseases
and every single time
our surveys got more inclusive of all
kinds of variables and every single time
the statistical packages got better and
the amount of co-founder adjustment we
could do got better the fraction of bad
health attributable or correlated to red
meat consumption shrink and shrink and
shrink and shrank entry
and it turns out that since then more
direct studies on food replacement
you take a group of people they have you
know they're doing XYZ in their diet
they say hey guys you need to eat more
vegetables you one group eats more
veggies one group eats more fruits or
something and you study the effect
one repeats less red meat one more Etc
other studies like that
have confirmed this trend and I'll sum
it up
the most
charitably that I can
to the position that red meat is
actually bad and here it is it's just
not clear that red meat in moderation is
harmful to health so if you're in a
steakhouse and you're eating your
chicken breast or your vegan option
and you see someone cutting an old juicy
rib eye or whatever I don't know steak
names uh Scott's video guys ribeye steak
I got it it looked like shit
it was terrible We're not gonna have
this on this channel out back
according to scientific research Outback
Steakhouse is the best steakhouse
and then there's like Mortons or
whatever
and then that's it there's two
steakhouses as far as I'm concerned in
any case
if you look at that person you're like
hey you know you're killing yourself
right I mean do you have children or you
want to take care of your kids you're
going to die on them tomorrow from this
red meat
you are probably overstating the case
very charitably very overstating the
case
so if it turns out that red meat is bad
for health it looks like it's gonna be
teeny tiny little contributor very very
small difference
and it's just not a big deal it's not
terrible for your health for sure
and there's a really good chance that it
actually isn't bad for your health at
all especially in moderation like a
couple times a week you have red meat a
couple times a week you have fish couple
times blah blah blah blah even a couple
times a day
so long
as you're getting good physical activity
you eat plenty of fruits and veggies and
whole grains
your caloric balance is such that you
are a healthy body weight
you smoke not at all or minimally drink
not at all or minimally for you college
students
have fun in college I'm kidding you can
grow up after be healthy
and take care of your sleep and stress
the total effect of red meat consumption
on increasing the probability that you
will have all these other bad health
effects
is somewhere between barely detectable
and maybe has no effect
so
the idea
that red meat is terrible for your
health
although it feels nice to say and we've
been saying it for so long is bullshit
as Arnold would say no doubt also
flexing his muscles though they are much
more impressive than mine
and uh
that's really the deal so I wouldn't
worry about it too much just be healthy
and all the other stuff and the kind of
meat you're eating probably won't make
either any difference at all or any
major difference
maybe later research will show that oh
actually there is a difference it's
going to be small but maybe it's
detectable we'll update you for sure on
this channel if we get some wind of that
but for now I'd say eat plenty of red
meat if you like and if you don't you
don't have to eat it so if you're a
carnivore
eat it raw
and if you're the liver King inject
steroids into it and then eat it and
then inject steroids into yourself and
then lie to people about it I've said
enough I'll see you guys later
