with artificial sweeteners the best
available evidence shows as of today
exactly what happens yeah as of right
now humans need the actual sugar
molecules themselves to trigger the
cephalic response and that the
artificial sweeteners just don't do it
if artificial sweeteners did trigger a
human cephalic response you could
predictably upon the presentation of a
lot of artificial sweetener potentially
cause a hypoglycemic episode that just
doesn't seem to happen with artificial
sweeteners I don't know how many people
have ever had a Diet Coke and they're
like holy crap I'm going hypo it just
doesn't seem to happen corroborating the
laboratory observation that humans just
don't seem to have a cephalic insulin
response with artificial sweeteners
