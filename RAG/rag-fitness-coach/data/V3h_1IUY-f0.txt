hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
critization welcome back to the
targeting the muscle Series where we
take traditional exercises sometimes not
so traditional and help you find
variations and techniques that light a
target the target muscle better
stimulate the target muscle better
that's what I should have said today the
target muscle is the side delt and
probably also the Trap and the exercise
is the upright row now I will be demoing
using a barbell upright row but this
basically applies all these tips
basically apply to if you do it with
Easy Bar even if you do it with
dumbbells in many cases and definitely
with a cable so let's get to it
all right tip number one is hand
position and here's the tip
play with a bunch of positions see which
ones feel best on your shoulders on your
elbows and on the actual side belts
there are many options
some people weird as it may be actually
prefer a closer grip some folks prefer a
really wide grip
and a lot of folks prefer something in
the middle you have to play with all of
these grips before you write off the
upright row is no good I had a training
partner once his name is Aaron Thomas I
would follow him on social media
he benefited most from an ultra close
grip which I thought was insane because
my shoulders would fall off and I did a
medium grip a little wide and I thought
that was great and if he tried it he
wouldn't be able to do it at all we were
training Partners we had the same basic
program and everything
we were built a little bit different and
that meant we did widely different grips
give that a shot you might find a grip
after a while that's like oh my God this
is amazing where the other grips just
didn't work all that well
thank you next tip
sometimes this works
leading with the elbows there's a
Temptation in upright rows
to just pull the bar just up and it ends
up being this weird reverse curl thing
where your elbows are below your hand
and that's a little strange yeah there's
some translocation some side dealt
involvement not a tongue what's better
is no matter the Implement you have is
to try to lead up with the elbows now at
the very top you can absolutely do one
of these but at least from here to here
you want your elbows to rise first that
can really put you in touch with that
side delt get things going as opposed to
just trying to get the weight up any way
you can that might not work out as well
[Music]
what height should you pull to really
depends on what your shoulders can
handle elbows can handle and what hits
the muscle the best there's a little bit
of a trade-off on average
for folks hitting the muscle the best
often comes only at the luxury of a high
degree of safe mobility here's what I
mean
not such a great way to hit the doves
is if you just pull to the sternum
to hear and back down that being said
pulling to the sternum is totally fine
it can work great and if that's the only
thing first of all if that works best
lights up your side delts amazing if
anything else hurts your shoulders or
elbows don't do it just stick to this
that's one option the next option is to
pull to the clavicle which is just you
know right above your chest that works
too there are more options you can pull
to the eyes you'll have to flick your
wrists up just a little bit to do that
in most cases but you get a crazy ROM so
you pull to the eyes and back down
elbows get really high feels great
generally the higher you pull the more
side dealt involvement there is if your
shoulders can take it I recommend you
pull higher here's the bonus round one
courtesy of Dr James Hoffman
pull to above the face you start out
here
slow that eccentric and go up and slow
The Eccentric huge huge stimulus
honestly guys
45 pounds or so for me is a working
weight for sets of like 15 to 20 so that
was a fucking hard demo to get it all
the way up here and slow that eccentric
down you're going to fire up your side
delts if your shoulder
aren't hanging don't worry don't go that
high as high as you can to get the best
shoulder work every option is a
perfectly good variant
[Music]
next tip controlling The Eccentric is
huge it is so
so tempting
to do upright rows of every kind machine
barbell dumbbell and just
do this
it's good the concentric is working but
the eccentric a lot of times if you
don't ride it out you miss out on that
amazing stimulus lower the weight your
boy is dealing with a fucking empty bar
here
come up to wherever you come up slow
that eccentric from the very top so
you're going to come up
slow it
I can already feel my side delts if you
can't feel your side belts with this
shit
hang on for you but on a serious note
give that a slow eccentric a try normal
on the way up slow it until it gets to
here then fast slow slow until oh just
about this Mark here give it a shot it
might work wonders
[Music]
final tip for trying to get upright rows
to get your side delts and maybe your
traps a little better is to actually
bend over a little bit so some folks
they prefer
standing up straight
give you a good side angle here and do
an upright rows not dancing wrong with
that but some people get a little bit
more if they lean over like maybe 10 or
15 degrees
Bend at the hips the bar hangs lower
you come like this and all of a sudden
you might be feeling a whole bunch of
crap in your shoulders that you weren't
feeling and sometimes for some people
it's significantly less stress on their
elbows and on their shoulder joints so
that might be a big winner now
you'll have to use like
50 of the normal weight
60 Maybe
so get ready for a huge ego hit but
we're not in the gym to get egos we are
in the gym to build muscles optimally no
matter what it takes so that once we
have big muscles we can be everywhere
else grocery store Airport
picking up your kids from daycare and
then you can have a fucking Eagle about
some shit daycare instructors like oh my
God your arms are so big you look yes
what if they are
all right folks when you're done flexing
random Preschool teachers what you can
do is throw some comments Below on which
exercises you want us to talk about how
to hit the target muscle whatever is
troubling you I can't feel my triceps on
you know cable push Downs we've kept
some answers I was gonna say we have the
answers that's a whole bunch of bullshit
makes no goddamn sense we'll try our
goddamn best how about that throw them
in there and let us know we will get to
every reasonable exercise that I'm
competent at doing if you're like
Turkish get-ups or some shit I don't
even know what the fuck that is we'll
get to it like comment subscribe and
