hey folks
dr mike ezratal here for renaissance
periodization
strength training made simple video
number eleven how should you be planning
your training
phases a little bit more advanced now i
know it's made simple oops
here's the deal just a couple of terms
message cycles and blocks
what you do fundamentally in training is
you go week to week to week
making the training harder in this case
heavier that's known as an accumulation
phase
then you take roughly a week to do a
deload to bring the fatigue down
and sort of re-gear to do another one of
those accumulation phases
that accumulation phase plus deload
phase together
is known as a mesocycle so that's one
mesocycle of training so every time we
say metacycle mesocycle mesoamazomezo
that's what we mean a phase in which
stuff gets harder for like
oh three to six weeks and then a phase
of just one week long where stuff is
really really much easier
now we're going to be focusing
on essentially like one or very few
things during that entire accumulation
phase and dlo there's really kind of
like one focus like
get stronger in sets of three to six or
build muscle with sets
of five to ten one of those phases by
itself is a mesocycle
but if you string together a couple of
them you get a training block
and a training block is often the same
kind of phase strung together
so sets of five to ten in one mesocycle
then the next metal cycle again sets a
five to ten and then again sets of five
to ten
that is a hypertrophy block that is
three mesocycles long hypertrophy for
strength training by the way
so that's the deal so you know we're
talking about blocks and stuff like that
now there are three kinds
of mesocycle we can do and you can add
up those mesos to make essentially three
kinds of blocks if you want
so this isn't strength training
only strength training you'll notice the
first one is hypertrophy what
it's hypertrophy for strength
bodybuilders
train to try to get as big as possible
with no care in the world about whether
or not that transitions really well to
strength
power lifters weight lifters strong men
they are trying to train
in a way that also makes their muscles
bigger but in only the way that will
transition the most to making them
actually stronger
which means that a hypertrophy phase for
strength
is usually sets of five to ten reps the
very low end
of hypertrophy for just the sake of
growing muscle
but it's the end that converts the best
to actually making you stronger
exercise selections here will be
movements that transition really well
to the competition movements like you're
not going to be doing a whole lot of
cable flies
you're probably doing wide grip bench
presses because they're very similar and
transition well to the bench press
but nonetheless a lot of these movements
won't be the competition movements
themselves
the derivative movements they're a
little bit more targeted or better for
hypertrophy if you need bigger pecs
that's what's holding back your bench
you're going to be doing a lot of wide
grip pressing
if you need bigger triceps you might do
something like jm presses or something
if you need bigger quads for squatting
high bar squats if you need bigger
glutes for deadlifting and
more spinal erector mass you might do a
deficit pull or something like that
so those are the exercises you choose
the volumes are going to be slightly
higher so
more sets than usual sets of 5 to 10 on
those exercises
it's going to make you bigger in a way
that gets you really ready
to take that new muscle and make it
stronger and that's what phase number
two is for
the basic strength phase mostly sets of
three to six
exercises that increase strength to most
and are also starting to look a whole
lot like
if not r the actual competition movement
so a lot of regular grip benching
maybe not full pauses sometimes full
pauses you don't have to do the
competition moves
but it's going to be very very similar
looking moves at that point and
normal strength training volumes almost
all of the other videos in this series
have been detailing what is essentially
the basic strength phase so if you want
to know a lot more about it
just watch all the other videos in the
series lastly we have the peaking phase
the peaking phase is designed to let you
show off all of your strength
properly exhibiting it in a way that
really lets you show off
everything you've gained you're not just
generally strong and there's a hint
towards it
you're literally doing a one rep max at
the end of this thing
to try to say boom this is exactly
objectively how much stronger i got that
requires a special kind of tailored
training kind of like uh race car
driving
there's a lot of it if you want to get
better at it of just putting in road
work and just putting in turns and
tuning your car when you want your car
to actually go to a race
you got to tune it special you gotta
double check it triple check it you got
to take a couple laps around the actual
competition track
so what makes you good at race car
driving is very similar to the actual
race
but there's a bit of an adjustment
period you have to have for the actual
race to do as well as possible drivers
don't just show up to the track and
they're like i'm sure i'll figure out
where their turns are and
take a bunch of practice runs this is
really what the peaking phase is
so they're not really getting better at
racing itself when they're doing the
practice runs i mean a little bit
they're getting better at racing on that
track to show off their speed
just the same way in a peaking phase
you're going to do a lot of sets of one
to three
real heavy real close to a one rep max
you're going to be doing lots of sets
in addition to that usually between
those heavy sets of one to three
those big sessions there's gonna be
other technical sessions between
sets of three to six reps at like three
to six rpe
very submaxible to enhance technique
between hard sessions so that not only
are you enhancing your ability to
produce maximal force
you're always enhancing your technique
which later helps you produce more
maximum force by making you more smooth
under the bar almost exclusively
competition exercises at this point
i look like if you're going to low bar
squat in the meat you had better be
doing low bar squat in
in the peaking phase as much as possible
not a ton of everything else
the loads generally go from an rp of
roughly seven to about nine
not ten because you're saving that for
the meat then there's at least a week
after that rp9 so it's like r7 and 8-ish
and then 9
and then there's a week where you do rp
3-6 it's basically a d-load week that's
very highly technical
almost exclusively the the lifts
themselves you're doing a competition
just very light
and then you show off right when you're
looking
at your volume your volume is going to
be
beginning at the peaking phase at around
what your strength training volume is
but as the peaking phase goes on you
actually reduce volume a little
until volume is very very low at the end
and
then the deload what's called a taper
happens because the volume has dropped
but the intensity has gone up
your preparedness your ability to really
show off at a low state of fatigue is
going to be super high you're going to
do your best possible
thing you have the gym lifts or whatever
competition you're doing
you show off and voila you're done and
the next
what you can do is perhaps another
hypertrophy phase or something like that
now that's where we get into phase
potentiation how should these phases be
sequenced because
really there's three different kinds of
phases you could sort of just do all of
them
at random or something there's a better
way first you probably want to put on
muscle
okay you need muscle as the raw material
of strength like that's what it's based
on okay
so you're going to do that with a
hypertrophy phase or a few we'll get
into that in a second
then you're going to take that muscle
and make it stronger with basic strength
training so we have the muscle we've
made it stronger
now lastly we're going to do a peaking
phase
to take that strong muscle and let you
show it off as much as possible in the
actual one repetition max itself
so with hypertrophy then strength then
peaking and then after that you're
pretty beat up you just did a meet
you probably take an active rest phase
which is like one to three weeks of
super easy
deal style training or not even any
formal training go take a road trip with
your friends and disappear somewhere
come back and then you repeat the
process again where you do a hypertrophy
phase strength face so on and so forth
now
for the best results just a couple of
notes you probably want to do two to
three hypertrophy and two to three
strength phases in a row
so a really good meat plan or to do a
really good job at piquing your strength
you don't necessarily just do one
mesocycle of hypertrophy one of strength
and one of peaking it's probably better
to do two or three hypertrophy two or
three strength
in a row and then one peaking okay
that's probably the best way to get out
of it because your body especially for
strength training
really responds to a consistent low
level increase for a long time in the
stimulus
you can put a lot of muscle in two to
three mesocycles of hypertrophy you can
develop a
ton of strength in two to three missile
cycles of strength training whereas one
meso just kind of gets you used to and
you can start the momentum going
you only ever really need one mesocycle
of peaking and then you're good to go
now
do you have to peak no if you're just
building strength and hypertrophy you
just want to be big and strong
you don't have any plans to test your
1rms or or
really take a whole peeking phase to try
to peek them because you could test them
at the end of a strength phase no
problem
and you don't have any plans of
competition we're just starting out
you're like like eventually i'll compete
but i've been lifting for two years i'm
not going to compete until i'm
you know let's say five years of
training how do i get the best possible
results in strength development well
you're gonna need more muscle and you're
gonna need to make that muscle stronger
so all you can do
is do two to three hypertrophy phases
two to three strength phases
repeat that again take an active rest
phase and then repeat that again
that's the way for long term to develop
most strength you only do peaking phases
if you really want to show off your
absolute best usually in a competition
folks that's it for this time see you
next time for the next video
