hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
what do you do if you are not recovered
you should have been recovered but you
didn't recover on time in
hypertrophy training that's a complex
question
luckily we have a complex but pretty
easy to understand
answer recovery training at every level
is the topic here
what do we mean by every level let's get
right into it so
there are different time scales and
targets of the recovery process
depending on how badly you are not
recovered for example
you could be recovered for everything
else and that muscle group fundamentally
that you're training let's say it's
chest
is pretty recovered but the exercise
you're not recovered for it's one
specific exercise that's bothering you
things aren't going well what do we do
about that
next we can ask the question and don't
worry we'll answer all these in their
due time
we could have a whole muscle group
that's not recovered like no exercises
recover for chest because
chest isn't recovered what about the
session
let's say we have chest and biceps and
back in the same session and
everything's under recovered there's no
way we're going to have a really really
good workout at least multiple workouts
in a row at this rate
for chest or back or biceps the whole
session is dog crap
what do we do about it it's going to be
a different recipe to make sure that
recovery comes along
than if just the bent row is feeling bad
but everything else is feeling great
like an exercise
or just the back wasn't under recovered
but the chest and biceps work
that's for muscle group next we have the
half week
option if muscles that you're training
specific ones or actually all of them
are under recovered for a whole half
week there's something pretty serious
going on that's going to need much more
in-depth remediation to get us back
on the recover track in addition to that
we have
options for deloading we'll talk about
what a deload
really requires how much under recovery
it's like a week of things going
really really badly what is required for
active rest
and that's generally when several weeks
things are going real bad and
specifically
what uh kind of exact symptoms come
where you decide am i taking a deload or
am i taking an active rest phase
and then lastly the longest time scale
of under recovery and the one
that requires the longest fix is an
entire low volume resensitization phase
when do you take a resensitization phase
versus just
changing the exercise for that day and
everything in between
let's get to it and start with the
exercise so here's the problem
you are underperforming on a given
exercise like
you did bench press 200 pounds for sets
of 10
last week this week it's 205 and it's
like sets of eight
and seven and six and you're grinding
close to failure you're like oh
the bench is off and or it
uh it's feeling really stale just you're
failing to connect very well with your
muscles
and or especially your joints and
connective tissues
just aren't feeling it you would love to
continue to bench press but it's just
bothering your shoulder
and maybe you know it's a bench press
specific thing and if
maybe you switch the exercise you know
your pecs fundamentally feel great it's
just that specific exercises bothering
your joints in a way that doesn't allow
you
to hit your normal planned small pr's
they're sort of the quintessential
progressive element of all training
okay and on one hint that it's just the
exercise that's the problem
is you're getting better on everything
through that whole past week and through
that week
so your chest has been getting stronger
and stronger and stronger you're setting
pr's on flies
on dumbbell presses but the bench just
is not going especially today
what do you do about it the standard of
answer just bust through
is a fine answer but i think we can
probably do better
so here are your options first
and i do mean first because this is what
you probably should try
first it's not just numerically listed
first in this list here
is try to alter the technique of that
exercise a little bit
to get a better stimulus to fatigue
ratio specifically try to get the feel
of the muscles generating high tension
getting a burn
while at the same time not irritating
your joints
in the way that they are so for example
if you're benching
and the bench just isn't going well and
your shoulder hurts maybe your right
shoulder right sort of in the middle
there
try a little closer grip try maybe
angling your palms out a little
try a wider grip try arching more
arching less
make some adjustments during that
warm-up process if it's not feeling good
and a lot of times that will require you
to decrease the load a little bit
but once the adjustments are made if
they work and here's the thing why this
is first a lot of times they do
all you do is you move your hands out
one inch and all of a sudden
the the bench feels incredible you don't
have any shoulder pain you're like i'm
glad i didn't
just take that whole exercise out and
replace it with something else and then
boom
you start a little lighter after a few
working sets you're back to hitting pr's
all over again and problem
solved fortunately it doesn't always
work out like that so what you can do
if that doesn't work is try to replace
that exercise with another exercise for
one or maybe a few
sessions but try it again pretty soon so
for example
week one uh bench press went fine week
two you had some
joint pain so week two you took out the
bench press that very day
and then week three you also didn't
bench you replaced it with a dumbbell
press or a machine press and everything
felt fine and now your shoulder feels
really good
doesn't bother you doing anything maybe
in week four
you try to bench press again and a lot
of times it'll go super well and it
turns out there's nothing wrong with the
bench press that means you have to stay
away from it for a long time
you're golden and the bench is back and
then in the next
cycle you mentioned everything's super
good so that's the first thing because a
lot of folks will have trouble with an
exercise and they're like not hack
squatting for another couple months man
it bothers my knees
what if like not hack squatting for one
or two sessions fixed all the problems
especially combined potentially with you
take out the hacks water whatever
is bothering your knees and when you
come back to it you try a different
technique and that one-two punch
really can ameliorate a lot of exercise
specific recovery problems
now that doesn't always work so our last
option is to just indefinitely take out
the exercise that's problematic
replace it with a very homologous
exercise that does almost the same thing
another flat press for example
or if a hack squat example a leg press
or something like that
really just accomplishes pretty much the
very very similar thing
but that other exercise you keep in
there
and the exercise that was bothering you
you don't come back to for a while
pick the next best high stimulus to
fatigue ratio alternative
keep it there keep leg pressing or keep
dumbbell pressing
and then maybe next mesocycle or a
couple mesocycles later
you come back around through your
rotation of other good exercises for
that muscle group and you're like oh
yeah
hack squats hmm i used to bother my
knees but that was like months ago
let me try it you try a little technique
fix and all of a sudden everything's
hunky-dory
and look sometimes it doesn't even work
like that sometimes for months and
months and maybe forever
very unlikely forever you're gonna have
exercises that you just never do again
because they just suck for your body
maybe they always did
but this is a little formula if you're
experiencing problems with a given
exercise
failure to recover to hit pr
specifically oftentimes
with joint connective tissue pain
involved this is a great way to
incrementally
think about okay i'm just going to
change a few things and if that works
great i'll be back in the mix super soon
if not we can take that exercise out
because remember in strength sport power
lifting weight lifting there are
exercises
which you have to compete at you can't
just get rid of them
and if you do get rid of them you got to
weasel them back in somehow to peak or
take time away from competition until
you can do the competitive movements
you can if you can't do a cleaning jerk
when you're a real deep shit for
weightlifting
bodybuilding hypertrophy training which
is what this lecture is about there's no
one critical exercise
ever that you have to do right you don't
look at someone's quads and you're like
for sure hack squats well maybe it's
just leg presses maybe it's just squats
maybe it's just a bunch of high rep
lunges and leg extensions
you can get big quads doing all kinds of
stuff so don't get super religious about
okay have to keep this exercise in
be flexible and if it's under recovering
specifically with joint connective shoe
problems
this is a good way to go about now
that's option one next longer time scale
more serious problem
is if a muscle group is under recovered
okay
how do you know that you're under a
covered in a muscle group well you're
underperforming in a given muscle group
which means
that pretty much every exercise you're
failing to hit prs
if your chest sticking with a simple
example is actually as a muscle
under recovered it's not like oh my
benches went bad but my incline went
great
the actual pectoralis major is
significantly under recovered which is
what this example is
that means your bench is going to suck
your dumbbell press sucks you're weaker
on the machine press and dips feel like
crap
everything involving your chest is off
right
that's just the way it works if that's
the case
especially if it's in the context of a
high degree of muscle soreness
like you got sore on monday now it's
thursday you're still kind of sore
and your pr's are all way off and it's
for all the exercises
and specifically if
you are a lot of times this will happen
as you get closer to the end of a
mesocycle or in the middle
but pretty high volumes are being done
you know it's probably not a fluke
like the muscle itself has been really
really degraded and is pretty
significantly under recovered
something should be done to remediate
that something should be done
to let that muscle heal what's that
something our best
option is the following the next session
you were supposed to finish that session
hard okay as hard as you can
the current session with chest or
whatever let's say it's monday let's say
you have chest again next thursday
your next session should be very easy
session
much more easy exact numbers are very
difficult to find it's very individually
dependent but i've got a really quick
template for you
you drop the load uh down by either zero
percent so you can stick to the same
loads same heavy weights
as planned or as little as 50 of your
plants you were going to bench 200 you
can even go down to benching 100
that easy because healing the muscle is
fundamentally what we're trying to do
here
and you take your sets your total volume
and you'd reduce it by 50 to 75 percent
yes that means if you did eight sets
on monday and you were supposed to do
eight sets on thursday you might do two
sets of chest on thursday
75 reduction that's a big deal why
because it's easy to conserve muscle
but healing muscle requires backing off
like crazy because remember what you're
trying to do
and trying to heal the chest in this
example so much
that next monday and thursday and monday
and thursday the chest is healed and
good to go for
weeks more of productive training that
means backing off
real big the last thing you want to do
is back off just a tiny bit
so that you get a worse workout but you
don't have any net healing
because it's still so much damage you
don't catch up on healing
okay that's a bad deal because at the
end of the day
you're just going to be back in the same
crappy scenario you were
next week and you're not going to be
growing because you're overly damaged
you're not going to be providing a ton
of overload so there's not going to be
any delayed growth either
so what hell you have to do you have to
do something again which you should have
done the first time
to actually recover and here's the real
tricky part can you push these sessions
close to failure if they're all wrong
yes
but for ideally for safety reasons and
recovery reasons you probably want to
stay
real far from fail okay and it says here
five rar at least nowhere close to fail
that means
this is really a recovery session okay
anyone who doesn't know a whole lot
about training
should be watching you if they're
watching you that session they'll be
like
i feel like you're not working too hard
you're like exactly i'm doing a recovery
session if someone's watching and
they're like man killer session and
you're like
thank you it's supposed to be a recovery
session they're like what the hell are
your real sessions like you must just be
like a nuclear bomb and like yeah i
guess i'm just an idiot because this
really is a real session it has to be
much easier
maybe lighter maybe you can still train
having
a ton less volume at least half the
volume or at most half
and then at least something like 5r for
the love of god 3r folks
back away from failure because pushing
to failure is really fatiguing and
really damaging
you want to back off not because you're
a wuss but because you want to back off
enough
to give yourself that recovery so that
next monday whatever muscle it is in
this case
in this example the chest is super
healed and ready to go
because then you have all the free sort
of runway in the world to have awesome
back to back to back chest workouts
right
and then what do you do in the next
session well so
monday you had a crappy workout under
recovered thursday you take that
recovery session as described
next monday do you just go and do
whatever you had planned
not exactly you use the same weight same
failure proximity so it's very close
same plan so let's say you did 100
pounds in the bench this monday
recovery session thursday next monday
yeah 105
right and if you're going to from fail
this monday yeah like one from fail is
the target next monday
but however you want to knock a few sets
off the plan
because when you did the super easy
recovery session on thursday
your volume sensitivity rose and your
ability to resist damage from high
volumes
fell that's a good thing because you're
super recovered and sensitive to growth
that if you
did let's say six sets of chest monday
and then you know three sets of chests
or something thursday to recover
next monday don't do seven sets do like
four or five sets
a little lower still a great workout and
then then thursday you can do more then
next monday you can do more so on and so
forth so because
you took such an easy day thursday to
recover a little bit ease back into the
volume you can still train just as heavy
as planned
just as close to fear as planned but
just a little bit less volume that way
i'll put you this way if you don't do
that there's a chance
that because you got so sensitized to
volume on thursday
you come back and do seven sets of chest
on monday you can nuke your chest get
super sore
and then next thursday you're again
under recovered and you're in the same
crappy place you were
once you experienced an under recovery
episode being more conservative is
absolutely the best way to go okay it's
like if you're leading a column of tanks
or something you run them out into a
field
and you take tons of fire you pull the
tanks back behind the tree line
and the next time you cross over to that
field you're not going to be all right
it's always same speed
you may be a little more cautious
because the bad stuff happened the last
time you did that just the same way you
smash your chest
way too much when you're coming back
ease in
ease in is the worst that can happen is
you can have a great workout heal from
an
extra quick super mod like very on time
by next wednesday you're completely
healed you're all right i have the green
light to
start stepping a little slower to more
and more difficult because that's the
key that's where all the growth comes
from
is the small steps towards more
difficult not ramping like crazy
getting super sore and having to back
off again
all right what about a bad
session okay what do we say is a bad
session well
you're underperforming but it's not just
per muscle group it's not just your
chest this time let's say the session is
chest and back and biceps strange
session i know but work with me here
off the cuff example you have to in
order to execute a full session protocol
everything in the session has to go
poorly and look unfortunately sometimes
that does happen
your chest training that day sucks your
back training sucks
and your biceps training sucks right all
or most of the exercises usually all
failed to hit pr's in that session and
a lot of times this especially happens
in a context
of a high degree of muscle soreness or
fatigue from the last session a lot of
times that last session
let's say monday you're under recovered
means last thursday that you did the
same session and you
crushed it and then you just didn't heal
over the weekend you came and you're
still messed up
and you underperformed sometimes
you've healed fine but you just have a
random day or not so random day maybe
you stayed up all night or something you
just feel like crap coming in
you just have a really bad session what
do you do
well if you catch the fatigue early
and you're confident enough that you
know fatigue when you see it more
advanced lifters are like this
you can actually just execute the per
muscle group recovery
protocol that we just talked about in
the last slide for every single muscle
group of that session
right then and there so for example like
in a lot of top uh power lifters and
stuff they know how this works
bodybuilders too they'll have bent rows
and then they'll have
uh pull downs they'll have bench press
they'll have flies and they'll have
dumbbell curls
they'll do their first warm-up of bent
rows and they'd be like nope
like i felt like crap all through the
warm-ups everything feels tight i feel
super weak
my lats are still sore my chest as a
store like is just
nah or one works at later you eat shit
your pr is nowhere near to be found
everything feels like crap you even
cramp up on one of the sets right dude
i know when to say when it sounds like
you're missing out
but a lot of times it's just accumulated
wisdom and when you didn't used to
listen to yourself
ten years ago five years ago you were
like fuck that
war time you would pull a pack or pull a
tricep or something and you're
smarter than that now so if you catch it
early just start the recovery protocol
for each muscle group just like we
talked last time do it for all the
muscle groups in the session
really awesome thing about this is if
you catch it early let's say thursday
amazing workout monday you didn't heal
yet one
working set into monday you cap it and
you're like that's it recovery
protocol needs to be executed now the
great thing is
you don't have a crappy session you have
a great recovery session
and then by next thursday or the coming
thursday you're 100 healed and you're
ready to ascend
all the way back up no problem if you do
choose
to say okay i'm going to grind and see
where it goes
once you get past halfway through your
session and you're like all right like
clearly i am very beat up this session
sucks
it's too late to take a recovery session
because you've already incurred so much
damage so you might as well finish that
session strong and get a little
functional overreaching effect
then you'll have to uh do a recovery
session on that thursday
and then you'll i mean yeah you have to
take it at any one point but look
you might as well take it earlier than
later if you know it's coming right it's
kind of like
you know you're on a road trip and
there's this really awesome gas station
and you're at a quarter tank you're like
we might as well stop here and get ahead
of the game a little bit versus being on
like an
you know a 20th of a tank and there's
like a sign that's like no gas stations
the next 50 miles you're like oh my god
i should have taken that one a little
early
when you have the ability to do a
recovery session and you for sure
know that you need one and you can take
it early take it early is better because
you can get right back into normal
training
but sometimes you just don't know and
i'm with you guys on that like i've had
tons of sessions myself
where set number one forget even the
warm-ups the warm-ups feel like shit
even the first set doesn't go poorly and
i'm like you know what man
let's give it one more set i do the next
set pr
next set pr crazy mind muscle connection
super awesome pump
the rest of the sessions like a nuclear
bomb amazing
man i sure am glad i didn't just shut it
down i could have taken a recovery
session but it would have been kind of
wasted session because clearly i didn't
need one
so i still hit pr's still got green my
muscle connection and so on and so forth
so sometimes you don't
know if you know take a recovery session
right away if you don't know
keep training if once you get past the
halfway point
and you haven't done a recovery session
yet and then you're like okay clearly
things aren't going well just finish
strong and then do the recovery session
next time right now when you do execute
the recovery protocol make sure it's for
all of the muscles trained
in the current session even if some of
them are split up and trained
differently in the next session so for
example
if you had chest and biceps in this
session
the next session for chest is on
thursday but the next session for biceps
because the more high frequency is
wednesday
you don't wait till thursday to recover
the biceps next
the very next time you train them that
would be wednesday you do recovery for
biceps so that
when you do thursday and you do the
chest recovery
you can actually do an overloading bicep
workout so we're going to treat this as
muscle group by muscle group
not necessarily session by such
all right half week
here's the deal what is a recovery half
week and when do we take one
we take one sort of not ironically
when we are failing to recover for half
a week or about that length of time
sometimes a little longer so basically
you are underperforming for a given
muscle group
[Music]
or a session or a whole session just
socks or just
chest sucks for every exercise so
there's definitely
a muscular problem not just a weird
technique thing or a joint thing
and this is confirmed at least two
sessions in a row
because sometimes you just get away with
taking a recovery session and you're
good to go if it's just one bad
performance
sometimes one bad performance you're
like you know what like i had
a fight with my girlfriend but then now
we're all good
wednesday sucked friday i think i'm just
gonna hit it hard you hit it hard you
didn't even need a recovery session
sometimes that's the case but
two poor performances in a row for the
same muscle group that's bad
that means you know you have an inherent
underlying high level of fatigue in that
muscle for example
let's say you train chest monday
wednesday friday
monday shitty chest workout no pr's
everything sucked
wednesday shitty chest workout no pr's
everything sucked
man you know just friday
okay taking just an easy recovery
session friday
may not cut it because you're in deep
and it's confirmed that you have really
high fatigue because two sessions in a
row
it sucked this is especially true
because here's the deal if you are not
currently training high volumes
and the reps in reserve are pretty high
like you're not super close to failure
that could just be a fluke
and maybe you can just take friday as a
recovery session come back next monday
and you're golden total possibility
but you need a recovery half week if
you underperform two sessions in a row
for the same muscle group
and it's in the context of like you're
doing a ton of volume so you know
the impetus this the the sort of drive
for that kind of under recovery is there
like it's obvious why you're not
recovering because the volume is insane
and especially true if it's high volume
and close to failure
because it's not a mystery right someone
could ask you like maybe you just
underperformed because you were just
psychologically off for two sessions
like
yeah i wouldn't normally agree with you
but ten sets of quads in every session
one to fail and feeling like the quads
actually are under recovered it's not
psychological when there's a ton
of stuff going on right so and all
this often happens when do you have high
volumes paired with
high relative efforts it's at the middle
of the mesocycle or later
so if it's like week one and you have
200 performances yeah maybe some weird
stuff happen take one recovery session
or just adjust your technique and you
could be fine
but if it's like week four or week three
and you underperform and it's high
volumes it's close to failure
you're going to need some meat and
potatoes recovery strategy in order to
bring down what is
probably we estimate a pretty high level
of fatigue now
it's not high enough to take a whole
week of easy training
and the rest of your body is probably
fine it's just a couple muscle groups
maybe just one
so we don't have to pull back on
everything it's not one of those the
recovery halfway is a great tool
when deloading which is a full week of
uh
recovery sessions is like overkill okay
but it's enough to where one session
isn't good enough
so how do you execute a recovery halfway
well
whatever your current week is on try to
finish it as strong as you can okay
finish your current half week strong so
if it's like monday
tuesday thursday friday that you're
trained really hard
monday starts to suck and and kind of
like last friday suck two
finish monday finish tuesday strong
because good as good as you can and then
the recovery half week begins
for that next thursday friday what you
do is it's really simple you
apply the recovery session protocol for
the session
remember from last time to every single
session
for half of a week yeah that means
if you train six times a week that like
thursday friday saturday half week every
single thing
is lowered to recovery status to
recovery style session
which makes it super easy but here's the
deal you could say well hold on like
not all of my muscles are messed up
wouldn't it just be for the muscles hope
if we need a half week that means
fatigue is really high
there is a risk that systemic fatigue is
getting up there and
dropping everything down everything down
to half to basically half difficulty or
whatever the recovery session difficulty
is
for a whole half a week not only does it
locally address the muscle
failure to recover but it also brings
whatever systemic fatigue is getting not
quite to deload levels high
but fucking pretty high it brings that
down too
a recovery halfway can really
re-energize you
for every other muscle group including
the ones that are really the reason
you're taking them
and they can buy you weeks more of
training which is awesome
so you don't have to deload for a whole
week to buy yourself weeks of training
that's super great when you come back
after that half week you want increased
loads
same rar targets as you need to
as you planned so if this half of the
week you did two reps in reserve
the second half of the week you did
whatever five reps in reserve super easy
recovery
next week yeah it's one rep in reserve
and five more pounds on the bar
totally however remember from a recovery
half week
just like even from one session volume
sensitivity is gonna
really rise which means if you're doing
you know sets of four at the beginning
of the mesocycle or say four sets
of chest for example at the beginning of
the mesocycle and you got up to doing
eight sets of chest and then the
recovery problem started you took a half
week
our recommendation is to start somewhere
at the midpoint between those two
when you're done with the recovery
halfway so you started at four in week
one
week three you got up to eight and let's
say week 3.5
to four is recovery halfway because week
three thrashed you
when you start at week four start at
six sets okay it's not so easy as to be
four
but it's not eight it's sure shit not
nine or ten
because that would just blast you right
back into the problems you're trying to
solve
so it's essentially we got icarus a
little bit we started to burn and
you know close to the sun we really
reduced our shit
and then we don't just icarus right back
into the sun
we ease in and we ease in and we zoom
and boom there you go
there's two more productive weeks of
training not
right back into the fire and burnt right
out and falling out the other way
deloading deloading is a is a very
colloquial term
it's one that's in common utilization
and
it's sometimes a general term that's
applied to just any sort
of reduction of volume and or intensity
or relative effort to recover and if
that's not wrong
but colloquially d-load is usually used
for
week-long stretch of recovery sessions
okay
when do you need to deload and this is a
very very common question we're going to
answer it right now for hypertrophy
training
when you are underperforming in a given
muscle group or session for every
exercise
and it's the second or more time this
past mezza
so in week three and a half your biceps
had to have a recovery session
in week five your biceps had to have a
recovery half week along the rest of
your body
it's now week seven of your mesocycle
and your biceps are again
underperforming
men you know it's probably nothing a
recovery half week is gonna really
really solve
and a lot of the rest of your body most
of your muscles or all of your sessions
start to tank as well because now you
have a different problem
it's not just that your biceps have sort
of flared up and we can cool them back
down
as your triceps are doing it too a lot
of your muscles are on their second or
third requirement for recovery
and that systemic fatigue that they all
cause and spill over is now
really really high and just a recovery
half week even
won't do it if a recovery half week buys
you another week of productive training
your accumulation to deload paradigm is
one
or two to one two to one sucks that's
like
training for eight months out of the
year and taking four months off
this is a very efficient way of doing
things it's time to really really back
up
really drop fatigue take a whole week to
do it
so that systemic and local factors are
essentially down to close to baseline
and we can line up another product of
many many weeks of training in the next
mesocycle
to actually get good results how do you
know
if your systemic fatigue is up you know
one way which is all the other muscles
start underperforming
but you can tell from other more
subjective measures for example
you have certainly get poor appetite in
a situation and
uh maybe you're cutting you still have a
poor appetite you're like oh that's not
good
right sleep trouble lethargy like you
feel like kind of like crap all the time
and a lot of times you tend to have a
psychological feeling this is kind of a
trip it's a real thing it's been
scientifically studied people who are
overreached have a lot of systemic
fatigue
tend to feel more often than not
psychologically overwhelmed
and it's not like a conscious decision
like oh this is just too much work
it's not you're thinking about it you
can feel the world about everything
like you're doing really really great at
work but you're overreaching in your
hypertrophy training and your boss calls
you and he's like hey can you come in
and just fill out some forms tonight i
know but we've got to get this project
out to the next
people in line usually you'd be like no
problem i'm just coming by the gym after
i'll be in at eight o'clock i'll sign
all the forms i'll take a look at them
i'll fax them to you or email them over
great
but like if you're super overreached the
way you might react is like
oh fuck i gotta go to work
oh god i hope i don't mess up the forms
and everything's just too much like work
is crazy
all i do is they just require so much of
me and you just
feel later when your fatigue is lower
you could what the hell does i do why
was i freaking out so much you tend to
freak out more be anxious
when all of that or a lot of that is
present and you're super sore everywhere
and you've already tried some recovery
sessions and your muscles are still
getting some trouble
you're probably in a high systemic
fatigue state and it's time to do
something serious
that recovery sessions per muscle group
work or even half weeks
just don't have the power to solve and
that's when deloading
comes in handy and of course especially
if this is in the context of very high
volumes
very high relative efforts low reps in
reserve
often at the end of your usual mesolink
so for example
if your usual metacycle is five
accumulation weeks and then one deload
week
and you're in week 5.5 because you auto
regulate and you're
burning alive and you feel overwhelmed
you have trouble sleeping your prs are
all in the drain
you don't have to really like flex your
einstein part of your brain
to realize you're systemically fatigued
because like why the fuck wouldn't you
be
you have already exceeded your normal uh
duration of accumulation
by half a week like yeah it fucking
makes sense that you're burned out you
don't be like man
what am i doing wrong nothing you're
training hard and it's just time to quit
like it's like a if you were at work
usually you leave work at six pm
it's if you're at work like working on a
crazy project and it's 11 p.m
and you're almost done with it you're
checking your work you're like man my
brain's just not working right it's
fucking supposed to work right at 11 pm
you're like five hours over your own
work schedule it's totally fine
now if you feel like you need to deload
in week one of training i'm gonna you
gotta put some einstein stuff into that
and figure out what the hell is going on
but at the end
of a high volume accumulation phase real
close to failure it's not rocket science
it's time
to back off big so how do you do it
first
finish your current week strong usually
good now if it's like monday or tuesday
just start deloading right away don't
finish the whole week if you're like
burning alive
but if it's thursday or friday you know
if it's wednesday dealer's choice
thursday or friday finish the week
strong as good as you can maybe modify
some stuff some more burnout stuff
keeping it safe high volumes close to
failure
then next week start a formal deload
week there's tons of ways to do this
including the very simple
just every session is a convention just
recovery session just like we
talked about earlier for muscle group
you could just do every session like
that on a dealer but there's a slightly
more complex way that actually saves you
time
the first half of a deal a week you cut
your sets by 50
so if you're doing eight sets of chest
it's now four sets of chest okay per
session
you take your load and you keep it
between 75 and 100 of your normal load
so if you're normally lifting like 400
pounds it's somewhere between three and
400 pounds right so it's still pretty
heavy
and the rir is pretty high zero to three
reps in reserve so like you're still
grinding it
just way way lower volume maybe slightly
lower weight that's just the first half
of the week
the second half of the deload week if
you do it this way
fifty percent of sets again so if you're
normally doing eight it's four it's not
another fifty percent cut it's just
fifty of the whatever you were doing
last week
fifty percent load reduction so if
you're normally squatting 400 you squat
200 out which is a joke
and the rir is 10 plus okay in many
cases at least five
plus it's like if you're squatting
pretty strong
you know if you're squatting 400 for
sets of 15
now you squat 200 for sets of 5. i mean
it's a joke
that is a super super recovery workout
you're really just it's just a warm up
right and that second half of the week
heals not only your psychological state
and the musculature it heals the joints
and connective tissues a ton as well
because it's so light so low volume so
easy
now if that second half of the week
feels like anything more than an easy
warm-up you're doing too much
and the risk of doing too much is much
greater than the risk of not doing
enough
like if you just don't even show up the
rest of that week i assure you as a phd
in sports science
you are missing out on a fraction of a
tenth of a percent of total lifetime
gains
that if you come in and you go too hard
you're missing out on a percent or
something of lifetime gains
because the chances of getting injured
go up much more chances of not dropping
fatigue and having a shitty
next whole meso go up a lot like when
you put on the brakes
put them on hard okay and over braking
is better as
a matter of fact that second half of the
week if you normally come in three times
like thursday friday saturday
what you can do is take your thursday
and friday because it's so easy now
you can condense them sorry your
thursday and saturday put them both into
friday
so instead of coming in three times a
week to the gym you come in
uh or sorry instead of coming six times
monday tuesday wednesday all the way
through saturday
monday tuesday wednesday you do each
isn't a workout although it's much
easier
if the razer you don't come into the gym
friday you come in and do
thursday friday and saturday's work
which is going to take a sum total of
like
40 minutes because it's ridiculously
easy and then here's the cool part
friday and saturday and sunday sorry i
misspoke
saturday and sunday because normally
saturday you come to the gym
saturday and sunday you're completely
off so instead of that second half of
the week usually for you is thursday you
train
friday you train saturday train sunday
is off during a deload with a condensed
version
you don't train thursday you don't train
saturday you don't train sunday you just
train friday and that training is super
easy
that half of a week with just one easy
session
versus the normal three hard sessions
the amount of fatigue reduction
potential is enormous
and you will feel 50 trillion times
better after that so much better in fact
that when you go on to the next
mesocycle you have a whole accumulation
phase
of super low fatigue and and tons and
tons of milking out to do and you can
have another whole productive
mesocycle of training
that usually works it works
gee probably four out of five times that
you try it four out of five mesocycles
but in roughly four out of five measures
you're going to reach a situation
especially if you're intermediate or
advanced lifter beginners can just kind
of keep cranking with de-loads no
problem
you're going to reach a situation where
a deload is not enough how do you know
if that's the case
how do you know that this next form of
reduction
of training volume this next form of
recovery is something you require and
that next one was called activerest how
do you know what's required well
you're experiencing psychological
burnout okay that even deloads don't fix
you're at the end of a deload and
someone's like fucking ready to do this
shit next week and you're like
no no i hate the gym i don't want to be
in here anymore i hate the weights
hilariously enough i'm in my last hard
training week right now
before i'm scheduled to take active rest
as i record this
and like i can kind of like that's how i
feel right now
i'm not super excited to train which is
crazy because training's my life
but if you push it hard enough for long
enough you get to that point
joint and connective tissue issues that
are not solved by a deload
like your shoulder was really starting
to bother you in the last two mesocycles
and this last one
really bothered you it's at the end of
the deload week and you're like
nope still hurts what are you gonna do
have another accumulation phase of it
bothering you even more and you can
retire afterwards no you may need
something
longer a little bit more of a huge
reduction in volume so you can really
really heal stuff in a huge way
right almost always this doesn't happen
after one mesocycle
it happens after multiple mesocycles of
really highly productive high volume
training
and at the end of maybe three four five
six of these mesos
then a d load just isn't enough it's
kind of like you may have a very well
balanced life
and weekends are enough to really get
you psyched for another week of the job
you love
after like five or six months you you
may be in a position where like this
weekend's not enough i need a fucking
vacation i need to go to tulum or some
shit like that
not see another human being for a week
not see my phone just take my phone and
throw it away
don't contact me by email work as far as
i can tell you i'm dead
you need that kind of a big break it's
the same kind of idea that sometimes
just weekends or sometimes just dealer
weeks are not enough to reduce the
fatigue
and hopefully you can sort of
plan these active rests around life
events like vacations you kind of know
when it's coming after a while if you're
intermediate or advanced
if you're beginner immediate though the
way you learn when you need an active
rest is when a dealer just isn't enough
and sometimes you don't know like that's
how activerest is sort of organically
born
like if you don't know what active rests
are and if you
just never been on youtube and watch
this video
if you if none of that concerns you you
will eventually discover active rest
yourself
when you do your normal deload let's see
dude do you know what uh deloads were
and at the end of the deal or the
beginning of the next accumulation phase
like halfway through week one you're
like
my elbow's still hurt and i don't want
to be here
it's probably not that you just got over
lifting altogether and you hate it it's
very rare
it's probably that you just need a more
extreme form of recovery modality
which is what you're gonna get the good
news is you can start to know
when you almost feel like that so you
can plan an active rest and not psych
yourself out by starting an accumulation
meso
and then having to fall off the wagon
now what are the options here
best way to do this is to start with a
deload which is good news because it's
really simple
deload first there's another way we're
going to talk about you can do this but
that's optional
deload first and then the next week you
take one more week
but you straight up don't go to the gym
you don't even go to the gym
because a part of the psychological
stress of training is just being in the
gym
and you want to just take yourself away
completely from that all together
okay you don't restrict your eating
because that's another source of
psychological stress and physical stress
by the way
you just eat plenty of protein plenty of
tasty things sort of whatever you want
you sleep a ton and live life like a
normal person of
i don't know how a normal person lives
because i'm a machine designed by the
government
to train hard just kidding it's a
corporation girlfriend
um it's the soviet union haha russia
joke
so uh i'm inclined to believe that the
way normal people live life is what i
see in commercials
so you guys know like car commercials or
deodorant commercials
where all the young hip beautiful people
are on the beach and they're having a
barbecue and they're
throwing a frisbee and everyone's
ridiculously attractive there's a golden
retriever there who knows whose dog it
is
he's nabbing the frisbee and you're
eating chicken wings over the fire and
how do you even like
most beaches you're not allowed to do a
barbecue on it's a public space
in any case just live like that god damn
it just your favorite car or beer
or deodorant commercial do that for a
week and
live like a normal person because look
uh real talk a lot of us get caught up
you know because we love him because
it's a great thing in this like
bodybuilding lifestyle or this fitness
lifestyle we're just grinding
and someone's like what are you doing at
2 p.m today you're like what fuck you
think i'm doing i'm going to the gym
it's legs
every wednesday's legs at 2 pm how dare
you even ask me that right
it's like when my dad sees protesters
on like fox news or something or cnn
he's like why aren't they at their day
job
that's a pretty good point so a lot of
times just like with work we say normal
people go to work
a lot of times we have this idea that i
just train that's what i do
and it's really difficult to
psychologically take yourself away from
that and go you know
this whole week i'm not going to train
it does two things one
it relieves pretty much any and all
psychological distress you're having
from training like if you're really over
training yourself won't be over when you
start missing the shit out of it and two
right into that point you start missing
it so much
it fills your heart up with this crazy
desire
just train your ass off and at the end
of that week when you're ready to start
training again
begin a whole macro cycle of training
multiple mesos strung together
multiple blocks strung together you are
just psychotic and you're like i'm gonna
take over the fucking world
and that desire of yours to train really
hard can
be fueled or can fuel 6 months
8 months 12 months of awesome training
and that's exactly the point
at the end of one of these active rest
phases you should be fueled up
psychologically
physically joint-wise muscle-wise
everything
for months and months and months of
hardcore training right
when you come back make sure to ease it
in
the biggest temptation in the world is
after active rest
if you ask someone the average trainee
like that monday when they finished
active rest
how much volume do you feel like doing
they're gonna be like all of it
get on the hack squat do eight sets piss
blood the next day because your quads
just melted into your bloodstream
bad news right that's how you get hurt
that's how you get rhabdo all this other
crazy shit
don't do anything like that remember
your volume sensitivity is going to be
through the roof
your growth sensitivity is going to be
through the roof start with
easy shit very far from fail three or
four reps in reserve
several sets per muscle group sometimes
lower frequency
ease in because guess what you have
to make things harder an entire macro
cycle
of a little harder a little harder a
little harder harder than last time
that's another greg the set impression
for you guys right
got a good point gotta go harder harder
harder but if you start it's super
fucking insanity hard where the fuck are
you gonna go other than the injury
nowhere so after active rest you're a
mature person
you're a fucking adult you're a planner
that's why the fuck you're watching
videos by renaissance periodization you
want to periodize
resist the temptation which is a
psychological feeling
which children organize their lives
around and do the right thing as an
adult
start off slow start off easy it's not a
wuss move
because you're preparing yourself to go
sky high eventually
and on the way there is where you make
all of your gains no one session makes
or breaks your gains
and when you are really sensitive to
volume and growth but
at a high risk of injury because you're
desensitized to all that work capacity
start up just a little bit and then look
if it's too easy next week you can up
the volume a little bit
awesome now just a cool strategy for you
guys to try
if you're at the end of a sort of block
or macro cycle of training you're like
in pieces
to the point where you can't even deal
it because sometimes your joints are so
fucked up your desire to train is so
messed up that you're
deloading is the furthest thing from
your mind and sometimes it's not even a
good idea here's what you can do
you take your recovery week your active
rest week your
non-training completely weak first okay
so accumulation
week five hell crazy psychoticness
right after off week that active rest
true week don't go to the gym
get into that bmw commercial with your
friends incredibly good looking i have
no idea where those people come from
my friends are now my friends are all
better looking to me i guess i'm the
ugly friend
after your easy super easy week of doing
basically nothing
then you do the easy part of your deload
week the easiest part you do it in
reverse
and then you do the harder heavier part
of the deal of the week and kind of is a
slow on-ramp
and then you do week one low volume
pretty close to failure now
real training but ease in so basically
as soon as you're icarusing yourself and
flying into the sun
drop all the way back down to earth no
training for a week and then slowly come
back up
i can't say as a sports scientist that
there's one excellent way of doing this
uh give both a shot see how you feel all
right
last up low volume re-sensitization
phase this
you execute for a slightly different set
of constraints and purposes
why would you do such a thing well you
may be in the following situation
you're no longer getting uh good pumps
or pumps at all or getting sore from
lower volumes as a matter of fact maybe
not even higher ones
you legitimately feel like you're
spinning your wheels you feel like an
endurance athlete
you do 10 sets of squats and someone's
like dude your quads blowing up you're
like no i'm just tired
all right that's not good that means
your volume sensitivity is super low
that means you're stimulating at least
as much catabolic process as you are
anabolic process
it's probably good to back away from
high volume training
and really lower how much volume you're
doing to let your body re-sensitize to
volume
and have it be productive again now
if you're doing technical calculations
and you've got you know
roughly your maximum recovery volumes
and your minimum effective volumes
this is technically when your minimum
effective volume starts to rise up real
close to your mrv
that window of training you have left is
real small and that's not a good thing
so you're in the situation where you're
still pumped to train psychologically
you don't need an active rest phase uh
your joints are okay
so you don't need an active rest phase
but your training is just super stale
you're not getting pumps you're not
getting soreness from even pretty high
volumes
fuck isn't this working that means
you're probably
sort of desensitized to volume and you
need a low volume resensitization phase
to re-sensitize the volume again and
have it be super effective
so what you do first is for sure take a
de-load then
in the whole mesocycle after you drop
your training to maintenance volume
which is roughly conservatively
a third of your typical volume that
means if right you do
sort of like nine sets of back three
times a
nine week per session 27 sets total
you would literally do three sets of
back three times a week that's nine
total sets per week way less than normal
because remember you're not going to
lose
any muscle like this confirmed by
multiple studies you're going to lose no
muscle
but it's so little volume that your body
starts to re-sensitize to volume again
and when you feed it later four and five
and six and seven eight nine cents per
session it's like holy shit and it
starts to grow again
okay and during this
whole mesocycle you progress in rar like
normal so you start at like three rar
and it's zero
but you don't progress in sets at all
you start at three sets per session or
roughly something like that whatever
maintenance volume is for you
and the week one and then week three or
four whenever you end
you end at three sets per session that's
it
it wouldn't be re-sensitizing to volume
if we progressed in volume
you don't change your volume at all you
keep it the same super super low now
here's the kind of messed up thing just
be ready for this during the
resensitization phase
you are not going to be getting
basically any pumps you're not going to
be getting any soreness
that's not the point the point is to
stay so far away from those things
that when you reintroduce volume they
start happening again because they're
good things we want them
but it's going to be super super easy
training and sometimes it's pretty heavy
training a lot of times
sets of five to ten reps is kind of
ideal for that situation
it doesn't have to be sets of five to
ten but that's a pretty good start
you kind of feel like you're strength
training uh but you don't feel like
you're really stimulating hypertrophy
good news you're not
you're preparing to stimulate
hypertrophy you're really backing off on
the volume which is the big
thing that caused hypertrophy and for
basically a whole mesocycle you're not
causing any growth at all but you're not
losing muscle
and what does that do is it sets you up
for another
many many messes a whole block of
awesome high volume hypertrophy training
or progressive volume hypertrophy
training
so yeah you don't grow for a meso but
then you grow for three after
the alternative is if you're already
really really desensitized to volume
is not only do you not grow this meso
but you don't grow for any meso until
this happens so you could be four or
five mesos in
without bring growing any muscle and
someone's like what's
messed up your diet good you're like
yeah he's getting good pumps in the gym
you're like no
like okay uh you're getting sore like
nope can't feel a thing
like huh maybe your body's just gotten
stale the whole volume and training
process and you need to back off well
that is the correct answer
sometimes active rest does that and it
does it almost every time
but sometimes you don't need active rest
and you can use this time to gauge your
maintenance volume
you can use it to get a little stronger
you don't have to back off because
especially psychologically when you're
still
pumped to train you don't want to have
to be like take an active rest and
you know you're in that bmw commercial
with your friends again and you realize
you're not your friends you don't have a
bmw
you don't want to be in this cabin in
the woods situation you want to fucking
be lifting and breaking shit and you
should be at a gym because it's
psychologically safe for the rest of
society for you to be sequestered in a
gym
that's when a re-sensitization phase is
better you don't need an active rest
especially because you're ready to train
super hard
now after one meso of this you
absolutely can resume normal training
again at lower volumes okay so if you do
three sets per session at the
maintenance volume during this phase
start with four and then go to five and
six
as autoregulation would say right or
if let's say you're on a diet break like
you just did a big fat loss diet you can
take a maintenance phase
and then you can take another one
because maybe you need more of a diet
break and it's sort of pointless if
you're not hypercaloric or
or um hypocaloric if you're not losing
or gaining weight it's
a little bit pointless for advanced
people to like try to recomp so maybe
you just stay
at maintenance volume for longer you can
do another meso if you'd like
but if you're ready to go either
increase your calories a little bit or
decrease by a little bit
you can absolutely go and hit up another
progressive high volume phase
if you'd like and if your joints are
kind of beat up after re-sensitization
you can do an active rest phase like you
take a dealer after this one
and then take an active rest and that'll
launch probably a year of awesome growth
sometimes people do that where after
like a year or two of insanely hard
training they basically have every
problem in the book
they'll take a low volume phase just
like this one
and then an active rest phase and i mean
that's just like the reset of a lifetime
how many of these do you have to do in
your entire training career the full
reset
i don't know maybe three or four but
every now and again they're really
really handy
folks what is the tldr of this entire
gigantic talk
you now if you go back and scroll
through this video
you have a toolkit to address recovery
problems at every stage of the process
right you know how easy you need to take
it depending on
how easy you need to take it because we
don't want a situation where
we are really messed up and we only take
a recovery session and we're just back
to dog shit right after
we're never left we also don't want a
situation in which
we are you know fundamentally pretty
good to go we just need like one easy
session
uh and we take an active rest phase or a
low volume re-sensitization phase for
every
magnitude of recovery problem there is a
time scale solution
and all you have to do is match one to
the other and then you are intelligently
using sport science to get the kind of
recovery
you need when you need it in the amount
you need it for the optimal training to
continue to progress and evolve
for you to get as jacked as humanly
possible eventually so jacked
that you challenge the military win and
we all call you
fearless leader until then
i bid you adieu
you
