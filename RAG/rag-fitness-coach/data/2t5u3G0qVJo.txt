and folks welcome back we're back weekly
webinar dr james dr mike mike i spent
like this whole fucking weekend chopping
down trees for my neighbor
i have so much wood brother i got wood
i can't wait to see your wood um is your
neighbor
paying you no but i got to harvest her
wood so it's kind of a win-win
and it was kind of sketchy because she
had like a bunch of trees that were
between
her house and like a fence so it wasn't
just like have at it it was like oh no
that house is going to be in trouble so
luckily holy shit
got him down like a glove and then i
spent quite a bit of time chopping them
shits up so
are you enjoying that kind of shit i do
you know like uh it would be hard to say
that i enjoy
physical labor but it's one of those
things i find satisfying
um you know it's like it's like lifting
like you know it's like you know do you
really enjoy it's like no i don't really
enjoy it but there's something about it
that is compelling and i
feel a great desire to do it and i feel
satisfied when it's over it's that same
kind of feeling
right that makes sense
yeah yeah so that's what i've been up to
how about yourself
um done with the bodybuilding show and
even though my face is no longer tan my
body kind of is
uh and i'm uh uh i have a dexa today so
we'll see how that goes
oh that's fine post about it yeah uh
i love to point out your my penis
whenever you get a scan like that like
look
you know your design really never shows
up man it's just not thick enough i
think
um it's like a pubic bone and that's it
i like to pretend like i'm a hot shot
exercise physiologist like oh yes what
was that number on my right arm oh look
there's my dick they're like sir get out
of here
sir this is borderline harassment
yeah all right
i am uh i'm ready all right
andrew atkinson right at the top
nice and he says she was from england
because he's
very very english name he
he would be a man who fights for his
queen's army
all right the one and only queen oh yes
hi doc i have a question regarding
soreness i know we don't want to have
overlapping soreness one session to the
next for muscle
and don't want to train sore which is
the rating system is
for on the mpt the physique templar but
house of war is too sore like if legs
recover and aren't sore by the
session but the doms the day after
training is crippling
getting out of a chair is a struggle is
that too sore even though by the next
session soreness is minimal if any so
so andrew minimal is not any those are
two very different things
if you have soreness and you generally
don't want to train
now minimal training minimal soreness
you can't train through
once or twice what james and i always
say is don't make it a regular thing
so if you did a whole mess though five
weeks and every time you trained when
you were sore you did a bad thing
it was probably not a good night's
you're probably fine it's not that bad
of a thing
but it's just not a good going forward
strategy to use so
sauna should be healed completely
perceptive sauna should be gone to zero
ideally every time you train
and if it's not then you're either
training too much in one side doing too
many sessions
um and so
uh now if you get super radically crazy
sore
but then you heal completely by the next
session and you're not training once a
week you're training at least twice a
week
that's totally cool that's totally fine
like there's nothing uh
damn thing wrong with that actually
that's almost ideal that means you're
getting wildly disrupted and incredibly
well recovered
uh a lot of people who don't grow well
uh from my experience
tend to not get very sore uh at all like
their pulsatility
if you measure soreness on some kind of
rating scale that never goes like this
it's just like me
uh people who tend to grow the most in
my experience or people get
really fucked up and then heal really
fast and as a matter of fact if you take
anabolics
uh you don't get any less sore usually
your soreness just goes away faster
which is a really really good sign so
it's kind of a best of all worlds
and he says also sorry go ahead james i
was just going to say
and i think most people kind of fall in
the middle where if they get crippling
soreness it lingers for a little while
which is why we typically say like don't
train to the point of being like what
you we jokingly call cripplingly sore
it's not that it's inherently bad and
mike and i aren't prudes about training
hard i think a lot of people often
accuse evidence-based people of being
kind of prude in terms of hard training
you should train hard and you should be
pretty sore from time to time but most
people
if they get to that point where they
like can't sit down that's going to
linger around for a few days it's not
going to go away right away but if it
does
that's great and as mike said that's a
pretty ideal situation
and then he says also how far into the
metacycle
are you change the more sore and peak
week is okay for example totally
and the thing is peak week doesn't
interfere with anything the first part
of peak week you don't want to go
too crazy but the second part of peak
week i mean you can overlapping into
deload soreness wise if it's okay don't
go ham and go nuts james and i have
covered this before
t weeks is not an excuse to all you
usually do just add a set to everything
you'll be totally fine
because remember you could do so much in
one session it literally interferes with
anabolism directly by causing too much
damage for you to have to fix
it's like doing a spring house cleaning
and breaking the foundation of your
house down with a sledge hammer like
it's not any more clean now it's it's
just
broken so there are limits to that but
yeah generally you can do a little bit
more
um and then he says edit for context
doing four weekly sessions in lower body
twice a week tuesday and friday
we're also going to hear your general
thoughts on this too apologies this is
covered in recovering from training book
hahaha
i don't know if it is uh general
thoughts on you doing four weekly
sessions lower body twice a week sounds
fine
sounds just fine yeah so ideally you
know i train legs also
i literally jared feather and i train
legs tuesday and friday
and we consider we consider uh uh
it a really you know thing when after
like wednesday we're feeling a little
like
thursday mostly gone friday super fresh
we hit it again friday and then saturday
we feel pretty fucked up sunday's like
healing a little bit monday's pretty
damn well healed and then tuesday is
completely good to go that's it
so yeah if you're if you're getting
overlapping soreness yeah minimalistic
you know what minimal minimal do less
do less focus on quality not quantity
soreness is always
and everywhere the biggest factor for
soreness is how much you do
okay so do less and you'll have better
results
and if you one last point on this too is
if you find yourself having to do a lot
to get to the point of where you feel
disrupted and you're getting sore where
you're having to do like over 10 sets
per muscle group on those leg days
that's as mike said sometimes it's not
about quantity it is about quality in
many cases and in this case you might
choose higher sfr movements and or you
might consider just adding a day
for that particular muscle group like do
quads three times a week and have one of
them be like an easy going day
um something like this beautiful advice
like for me for biceps
there's nothing i can do to get them
sore shorter like 15 sets and i know
it's just way too much damage and i'm so
tired it's all junk volume so i do
biceps three times a week
eight sets each time and then it solves
the problem big time so yeah there you
go all right
great question from andrew next up is
profit
fear what yeah
it's a serious name
why am i not seeing it like profit like
p-r-o-f-i-t e-r-o-u-p-h-e-t
uh oh profit yeah i was thinking like
money profit
that's what i usually got it
um all right so this is actually gonna
be a relatively quick question because i
have a video reference sticker for this
and i think this is still valuable
because
people can learn a lot if they don't
know about it prophet fear says
i'm gonna be quick uh so will we prophet
fear we got you right back
um thoughts on john meadows video on
range of motion uh
tldr john and mike's former opponent kaz
when i hear kaz i think bill casmire but
that's i have never are you kidding me i
would be
honored to die by bill casmire's hand um
that can't be right oh cass maybe cass
coach kassam maybe i don't know
okay that's my best guess uh have sat on
record that evidence
on ram is mixed yes it's mixed but
really tilted towards full rom
john says using full rom or partial
depends on the exercise and feel
third opinion so my entire opinion on
range of motion and its limitations
is in a youtube video called the case
against full rom
it's on rpe strength youtube so just
just google it the case against full rom
if you watch it it is unlikely we'll
have any further questions about range
of motion but the tldr that video is
full range of motion is the standard
baseline assumption
until and unless the stimulus to fatigue
ratio of a partial
of some kind is reliably better so like
if you get
uh better pumps uh better tension
better burn and a better perturbation
from a partial version of an exercise
than the full one in the target muscle
and also you get less of every kind of
fatigue most specifically joint
connective tissue fatigue
then that james and i would never in a
million years tell you to do full rom
because it's objectively worse uh but
usually that's not the case and nine
times out of ten we take people through
full run they're like oh my fuck my pump
my attention my blah blah blah is crazy
my joints feel great um so most of the
time
most people doing partial rom are just
excusing it john meadows is not one of
those people usually when he has a
partial rom exercise it really is
because
he's so tuned into his sfr so uh it's
definitely
i think that's i think that's the last
word on the subject but uh and that
means john and i are largely in
agreement there
uh james anything to sprinkle in yeah
and i just think this is one of those
in advance consideration and by advanced
we're talking about people who are late
in their kind of physique and or
bodybuilding career and they're really
looking to eke out as much out of each
session as they can because they've kind
of exhausted all their other intensity
techniques
and general volume intensity
manipulations this is not something that
you would generally start a beginner or
intermediate lifter on
you would probably keep them doing full
rom for as long as they can
until they get to the point where they
are so dialed in to their mind muscle
connections and they start having some
of the major constraints that advanced
lifters has
that you might start entertaining that
so this is one of those things right
here if you're watching this and you're
like oh
mike and james think that you know
partials are okay it's like yeah we do
but not for you
[Laughter]
you're not qualified to be doing
partials i'm not even um
me neither i do full rock i don't do any
partials right it doesn't help me so
yeah so like uh james that's an
excellent point i'm glad you brought
that up
and we have other videos in this like
beginner versus intermediate versus
advanced
and we're going to have more videos on
this later there's a progression
in hypertrophy long-term athlete
development the first thing you learn as
a beginner is technique and that means
full range of motion in almost every
case
then you learn how to train harm like
once your technique you can't do one
without the other like you can't do one
before the other you can't train hard
when your technique is not existing or
sucks because
you're just training wrong first you
pick up technique
then you learn how to train hard and
then you pick up the mind muscle
connection of like okay where's the
tension so on and so forth
only when you've picked that up can
someone actually use the mind muscle
connection with you
and really tailor sfr so a lot of the
concept behind stimulus to fatigue ratio
a lot of beginners would look at it and
be like i don't even know if i'm
experiencing these things like do i get
tension at the target muscle and james
and i would usually say
let me see your squat and it's just
they're deep squat hyperbaric you're
fine
your quads are going to grow keep doing
when yeah let's say just
great technique keep learning then
eventually learn how to grind
okay and then when you learn how to
grind then eventually you can learn okay
am i grinding with my glutes but don't
worry everything will be way bigger by
then
and that's when it actually matters like
it's so funny when people who weigh like
and no offense to anywhere all started
small i started smalling almost all of
you i started at 100 pounds
i'll just use myself when i was 100
pounds you know i didn't luckily have
the audacity to be like oh is this squat
going to make my glutes or quads burger
like the fuck you give a shit for
you don't have any glutes and quads like
you know people who are starving aren't
like uh there's too much sauce in this
pasta and this is really chicken or it
looks like beef like they just eat
motherfucker like
so a lot of times it's you gotta not
earn and some moralistic like you have
earned the right to do mindless
connection brother you literally have to
grow into it and only then does it
become apparent to you that you have the
skill set to decide
another quick analogy is like uh someone
who's been wrestling for three months or
doing jiu jitsu for three months
like what's my game plan motherfucker
you don't have a game plan you don't
know anything oh god just tell them
take down don't die take them down
remember that one thing double leg dude
the doubler that's the only thing you
know
so but but you know i will say
everyone likes to feel advanced right
james like beginners love asking
advanced questions because it makes them
feel
like i'm in the know like i'm part of
the advanced group like
yeah and the the goal is not necessarily
to be advanced because when you're
advanced everything sucks
your training is needlessly complicated
it's not like you're doing advanced
training because you get more gains out
of it you're doing advanced training
because you have to
people think advanced means better it
doesn't mean better it just means like
this is the new
minimum standard that you have to hit in
order to have progress 100
100 all right next up is our perennial
perennial finalist
i knew it was coming i was like it's got
to be him
there we go montes says he's got a
question
uh that is how can you know if you're
completely recovered after a deload at
the end of a macro cycle
if you change most of the exercises rep
ranges that started in that of the new
macro cycle great question
easy answer you do uh an active rest
phase at the end of a macro cycle
so you can really make sure to clear all
the fatigue and know for sure recovered
and the second part of the answer is
you should feel from a systemic
effective and just wiggling your body
around and are there any kinks and
and pieces of soreness in it uh you
should know you're recovered
again if you don't if you think you're
not recovered you need more time to
recovery because you've got another
macro cycle coming up
you know what i mean it's it's kind of
like if you have a really big drive
ahead of you it starts at 12 p.m and you
wake up at 7 a.m
and you're like i think i could go back
to sleep and get a few more hours of
sleep
just do it because you're going to have
a big drive you're going to want to be
awake it's not one of those things you
question if you put the icing on the
cake james
i so i my brain went a slightly
different direction and i really liked
the question again
also uh montes always delivers really
good ones and always comes up with like
weird nitpicky issues so right
the the the baseline way to answer that
question is like okay well are you
recovered
the easiest way to answer is like can
you do what you would normally expect to
do at whatever volumes and intensities
that are set right
so the problem that you run into in this
situation is after you do the deload and
maybe you had a whole
macro cycle or maybe even just a block
of using
these particular movements when you swap
in for the new movements and you're
trying to figure out
am i sufficiently recovered for this new
macro or this new block
you have all these new movements and now
you have kind of the calibration period
for your new movements
which is usually like slightly worse
than you would normally be had you've
been dialed in to those movements so
typically what you will see is like week
one
you might get a false uh positive hit on
did my performance go down right it's
like no you just you were doing high bar
squats and you switched to front squats
and you just kind of suck at front
squats for now
but a week from now you'll be right back
to where you were so it's an interesting
question
there are a lot of different boxes you
can kind of look at in terms of
perception of fatigue you know relative
effort all those things
yeah but sometimes as dr mike said it's
good to take that active rest phase
and one of the things that you can do is
kind of sneak some of those new
exercises in during that active rest
phase even if you're not training them
super hard which
active rest you really shouldn't be
training super hard but like if you know
you're going to do a movement that takes
a little while to get going like just as
a front squat for example because it's a
little more complicated
sneak that in there so you can have like
a week or two of practice
that way when you actually start
training it you'll have a better idea of
where that baseline is and where you are
now and then you can kind of make that
decision
yeah and guys remember the systemic and
local perceptive fatigue
is really important at the beginning of
the macro cycle look yeah your squat
might be lower because you have been
practicing high bar squatting you've
just been doing front squats for a whole
macro
fine but how do those squats feel at the
beginning of the macro you should be
getting into the bar you should feel
real
flexible really limber your muscles
after a few reps should get a real
decent pump and just really perturb you
know holy shit
joint should feel really good you should
feel excited and ready to train you
should feel burdened
if you don't feel all those things then
you need more recovery maybe but if you
feel all those things but then your
squat performance is down
look it's almost certainly down due to
technical factors and it's not down
because you're fucked up because
somebody'll be like damn
squats down maybe you're not recovered
and you're like i feel
recovered in every possible way so
what gives and they're like well yeah i
guess you're probably recovered so it's
not
i'll tell you this when you're under
recover and you're an advanced trainer
like yourself month
it's not really a mystery you know like
you fucking know
like right now i'm post bodybuilding
show and i'm training pretty hard to
catch a bit of the rebound before i
taper things down a bit and go into x
i don't feel a hundred percent i don't
have to lie to myself right
so but after active rest i know which is
gonna be like like a trillion bucks
it's it's part of that perceptive
systemic feel
totally you know the situation i'm
thinking of right now that comes to my
mind is my kid
i don't know if you've ever done this
but uh have you ever taken like a long
time off of heavy barbell pressing like
you did a lot of dumbbell stuff or maybe
a lot of flies and then all of a sudden
you have like a wide grip bench
programmed in and you're like oh
what what max goes from 500 to
315. yeah and then then i'm struggling
with you guys
okay this is fine then the third week
you're like yeah i'm back in business
baby but that first week
100 oh what i've had a
smith machine shoulder press go
up by 100 pounds over the course of six
months
like that's i didn't actually gain a
hundred pounds on my pressing folks
it's just all tech because the first
time i did it i was like
doing like 225 for a set of 10 and i was
like
i knew it like i was recovered super
well chest-wise shoulder tricep but
everything felt wrong
like the movement felt wrong and then i
learned to do the movement a little
better my body got used to used to used
to it
and then like six months later i was
legit i did 325 for 10.
uh in the overhead press on the smith
machine and i was like
okay i was just every week i would just
add five pounds and my r just never
went down so i was like okay i'll take
it
that's one of those things where
technique's a big deal and it takes a
lot of time to get used to so you have
to rely
on other factors as well nice question
all right l-a-v all right
right there perfect oh ours look really
similar now that's really cool
oh good for what that's worth what
evidence is there for re-sensitization
phases or the phenomenon
uh or is it a misnomer can you please
elaborate so
oh i had some good stuff too go ahead
yeah so i'll i'll start it off and then
dr mike will will take it further so
the evidence for that actually came from
tapering literature because the taper is
such a huge reduction in
um training volume that what they found
afterwards is that the athletes were
much more responsive to training in the
period following a taper
and so if you actually read like some of
the classic tapering literature like
mujica
that is listed as one of the benefits of
tapering is re-sensitizing the athlete
to training stimuli
and so we've and you know that has been
expounded upon to look at things like
deloads and active rest phases and what
do we find that yeah that's generally
true you take a reduction in the
training volume and you re-sensitize the
athlete to the training stimulus
same thing goes with variation and other
things like that um
so that's where that came from no one
generally calls it a resensitization
phase that's just kind of the
the term that we have adopted because we
think it's um just
more literally descriptive descriptives
going on
it's more applicable right so you
wouldn't tell someone to taper for
uh forgetting this effect yeah i'm not
peaking right exactly you're just
telling them that this is a phase with a
distinct goal of resensitizing to
training so if you
if you do a pubmed search for like
re-sensitization phase you won't find
shit
so this is just kind of like the middle
ground between
the exercise science literature and then
kind of like the strength and
conditioning world
we take both of those and we put
something in the middle we say hey this
is something both of us can understand
and it's easy to implement
yeah super if you're looking for
some newer references specifically in
lifting
i would uh seek out james krieger's
volume bible
which talks about uh re-sensitization to
a considerable extent and show some
studies
specifically there's one really good
study where they trained one group
continuously
and then they trained another group they
trained for a few weeks and they just
wouldn't train and they trained for a
few weeks and they wouldn't train and
they trade for a few weeks and they
measured
and that group even though they trained
only two thirds as much total time
got the same results as the other group
that trained the entire time
because that group desensitized the
entire time in this group
desensitized re d re and they were just
it was just not it's unbelievable
actually a huge
kind of a landmark study for like oh
fuck we're all training too much
um because you know you see people
spinning their fatigue in the gym and
they're cranking like grind baby like
you should take a fucking d load they're
like
will i lose my gains like no you
literally gain more after your d load
that's the whole fucking point of the
dealer and then greg knuckles has a
great article
uh from a little bit a little while ago
a few years ago
where he talks about um bionuclear
domain satellite cells and noob gains
where he talks about the
re-sensitization phenomenon considerably
goes into some of the molecular
mechanistic mechanisms so it's really
good stuff
because he had a friend uh of his that
like
was lifting for a while and he stopped
lifting and then within six weeks he
gained like 20 pounds of muscle and lost
like 10 pounds of fat
and everyone's like bullshits guys on
steroids and he shares how it wasn't
he just benefited wildly from this
resensitization phenomenon
of like he was really sensitized because
he hadn't done shit in a while
and he had been at a high level before
his body was super primed so the real
kicker there is
um you don't want to completely train so
you lose muscle
you want to go down to maintenance
volume so you keep all of your muscle
but get a bit of that resensitization
effect and then go back into it
is it time spent away from growing yes
but it is benefited on the other end by
growing more just it's literally the
same
algae in the case of staleness no
totally yeah right or like we could say
like we could steal me on the argument
and say you are growing but you're
growing at this fucking snail's pace
right
um you could just be growing better um
and yeah yeah
stainless yeah you may you may not be
growing at all
and also you know people like if you
have like sort of like philosophical
conundrum accepting this just think
about how this applies in every single
other
facet of life for example like how are
you more productive at work if you just
work without weekends always
or are you more productive on the monday
after you take a nice relaxing rest
weekend off
there's a fucking reason we have
weekends and it's not like people say
like man if capitalism was unregulated
we wouldn't have weekends like
sure we would corporation does not want
you to grind yourself into a pulp they
want high quality results
and you notice this by the people that
make the most money the corporations the
people that are the most important the
people get promoted the most
dude they get like two weeks off anytime
they want like the most talented people
at a corporation be like hey i'm taking
a month off in spain like
okay whatever you need bob just come
back with those designs after like
it's a thing it's a real thing in many
other respects so it's totally okay to
back up
re-sensitization is is almost certainly
a very confirmed phenomenon
so dr mike i keep seeing your
fucking thumbnail for the muscle
asymmetry thanks scott
i hate it so much it's so weird you're
supposed to hate it you're supposed to
click on it and then talk shit and then
based our algorithm what was that movie
uh
was it scary movie with the guy who had
the little hand yeah
absolutely terrible i hate that guy too
actually for food and feel like no grab
my little hand
that's what it keeps making me think of
yeah i don't like it either
it's disturbing somebody said like wow i
would actually uh be really happy to
have
um anyway
it looked like somebody the most apt one
was like it looks like when piccolo got
his arms sucked out by cell
oh yeah you know what i was thinking
about the other day was the live-action
dragon ball movie and how
just awful that was like an
insult to art itself and like the
piccolo costume was just
so amazingly bad folks if you it's like
they
had a retainer that actually had seen
dragon ball z yeah
yeah if you guys have exhausted your
your amazon and your netflix and your
hulu like
look up dragon ball i think it's called
dragon ball evolution oh
yeah it's bad and then once you finish
that watch the latest season of big
mouth which is fucking hilarious
oh fuck i gotta get out of there oh yeah
oh yeah
so good all right next up zenith
was just three in a row and then guess
what tj cool is off
oh yes yeah uh all right zena says how
would you count
reps in reserve when training the
progressions of an isometric exercise
like the
pull is that called plank or planche
planche you meant plank
but yeah no no james i think it's like a
famous
no it's it literally is spelled like
that it's like a thing it's it's a thing
i'm telling you it's like this weird
gymnastics thing or front lever
so because i'm a red-blooded male i
don't train dumb shit like that
jk next are you serious note you
if you're not doing standardized reps
you cannot do rir you need some other
measure of relative effort
a good one for isometric exercises is
number ones in reserve
that's a pretty easy one like if you're
like all right i could have gone another
five
seconds i'm just gonna stop there you
stop there and you do that you do like
four sets of five seconds in reserve
next week you do four seconds in reserve
then three then two then one and
eventually you're pushing super hard
until you fail
and you should probably be doing that on
occasion james yeah and that's like you
can also use like an rpe
type thing that would be fine sometimes
when you try and adapt like
so i'm not against the seconds in
reserve but you have some people who
might be able to plank or planche for
like five to ten minutes and then you
know five seconds is insignificant
in that's on that time scale so you
might have to play around with that idea
that idea works
you just might have to scale it a little
bit differently and that's when i think
like an rpe
is just easier or you say like today
we're going for like a 9 out of 10 or
a max effort you know something like
that yeah and another one is like so
for james's advice like okay let's say
it's five minutes and 30 seconds is your
pr
start next week at 5 15 and the week
after 5
20 5 25 5 30 5 35 big pr and then d-load
or something yeah
totally totally all right mr tj
cool it's kind of an audacious name
it's very very audacious congrats on the
show win
thank you so much your back and legs
were way beyond everyone else's thank
you so much much to serve win
i have seen multiple interviews in rp uh
multiplayer's in rpg videos recently
where you expressed the importance of
scheduling a body part first in a
workout
if you are prioritizing that body part
how valuable is manipulating the order
of movements within a workout compared
to the other factors you manipulate when
prioritizing the body parts such as
weekly volume
uh not as important so weekly volume is
more important
frequency probably more important
intensity much more important
um does the value of exercise order
manipulation appreciably change
depending on the individual situation
yes it is program form for instance an
individual has a high work capacity
the small drop off and rep strength will
work out might diminish the importance
of exercise order absolutely
so here's the real critical factor the
only reason an exercise order really is
important
is because it allows you to put your
best foot forward your highest quality
work first
it allows you to get that muscle closest
to failure as its own limiting factor
without other things other muscles
systemic fatigue blah blah
if you can have an amazing second
exercise uh let's say you do bench press
and you get whatever
and then your real focus is back so you
do pull ups after if your pull
ups go stellarly like as if they were
fresh after bench
you're fucking golden man second
exercise is great but if after bench
you're a fucking wreck and your pull-ups
are like cut by three reps each or five
reps each
you can automatically see like okay if i
did these first i would just get way
more reps at the highest intensity my
fastest fibers would be the least
fatigued
i'm definitely missing out exercise
order is thus important
the degree to which you afford you to
work much harder and closer to your
muscular limits
during those first exercises and if
you're not really slowed down much no
big deal but you know when you are
because you can always compare
performance if i did bicep curls fourth
versus if i did them first how big is
the difference if there's almost no
difference you're fucking golden
as you get bigger and stronger those
differences start to expand to something
psychotic
back at etsu i watched james deadlift
550 for like sets of five
he's just not a lot after that this you
know
like what is he going to do some leg
press doesn't go home
but if you were to say okay we're really
focusing on quads he could probably leg
press a hundred more pounds for the same
sets and reps uh if he was fresh versus
after
four sets of five and five fifty in the
dublin so if we really wanted to
emphasize quads we'd never
fucking million years have deadlift
first so that that's the example like
but if you really honestly can't tell if
your work is still super high quality
you're fucking golden
james yeah that was a really good answer
i think the the thing with exercise
order is it gets confused with the kind
of the
classic strength conditioning kind of
stuff where exercise order actually does
matter because there's a clear
delimiting like limitations of
performance depending on what you do in
what order
or is it like bodybuilding and
hypertrophy as mike said it's much more
nuanced in terms of like
can i continue to have a high quality
session even if i flip a few things
around which
on paper may not make the most sense
right and that's usually more often than
not the answer is yeah totally not a big
deal whereas like in um
if you have an athlete and you say okay
well we're gonna do sets of 15 on the
leg press and then we're going to try
and do some you know
jumps and bounds afterwards it's like
that's clearly a violation of exercise
order because they cannot achieve an
overload on the jumps and bounds after
the leg press
but if you do it the other way you can
get both so that's the i think that i
think that's where a lot of the
confusion tends to come in
[Music]
dude we got another one right in a row
this is incredible
ad eel this was like the
best the best webinar ever gift from god
what muscles slash movements in the gym
do you think contribute to punching and
kicking the most besides actual
technique slash skill i'm glad you said
that
because james doesn't have to go on as
magarant of it's mostly technique and
skill
james what muscles are we talking about
separately of course can you imagine if
you listed the same muscles for punching
and kicking
you're like it's all abs for both it
turns out like there is a lot of overlap
i think
who was i think it was i think it was
rampage once he like put a hit on
somebody and that somebody
in the post flight interview said
something like oh that you put a good
hit on he was like yeah put my ass into
it
um when you teach someone to strike what
we find is that there's a huge amount of
overlap
in terms of like the amount of hip and
trunk that you start using
so it's very easy to look at like a kick
or punch and be like okay well i raised
my arm up and then i extended my elbow
so that's like okay shoulders here
tricep here but the reality is is like
you're moving your trunk
you're whipping it you're pivoting off a
leg right your your leg is actually
the the big kinetic chain point in terms
of you're pushing into the ground the
ground's pushing back
up through you into your trunk and
you're trying to transfer the force that
you pushed into the ground up into your
hand as you're turning it around
right so you end up using quite a bit of
muscle mass and in terms of
the ones that contribute most to like
punching and kicking
strength and power i would tend to say
the muscles of like your glutes
and your trunk muscles now that's not to
say that you know your
your legs and your upper body aren't
specifically used also
but i think you know in the grand scheme
of things when you teach people proper
technique you find that
yes having a big chest and big strong
arms will help you punch harder
absolutely but if you're just throwing
punches
from you know very straight on like this
you're not getting as much out of it as
you can so i would tend to say
you know in terms of movements in the
gym that i think contribute the most is
going to be your heavy compound basics
which are
done in some way through the floor so
your pre your overhead pressing
you're bench pressing to some degree and
like your squats and deadlifts for sure
yep just uh i'm going to make that a
youtube video later
and talk about that in youtube in 10
years or something
um yeah james covered pretty much all of
it the only thing i would have to say
is once you've covered the so here's a
really interesting thing
the best punchers and kickers once they
are skilled
are often the people that are best at a
loaded triple extension
lotus so if a guy can jump super high
and he's in my weight class i'm like
he can fucking when he does technique he
can go i'm like i'm gonna get knocked
down fuck out by this guy who's gonna
kick me into the fucking moon
because it's that hip and trunk
musculature that lets you jump super
high
um and so and that takes care of kicks
in addition your quadriceps
particularly rectus femoris is pretty
important in kicking your abdominals
you have really strong abs very strong
hip flexors yeah like you can use that
athleticism to launch that kick and then
use those muscles to carry it through
and then lastly let's not discount it a
big ass chest
shoulders and triceps are super helpful
for knocking guys the fuck out
yeah tank abbott from back in the ufc
days legit benched
with a super big bounce but who gives a
shit uh 600 pounds
like you don't want that guy to punch
you i promise you don't like it
and the people to ask because you know
in cell nerds on youtube will say
technique techniques got nothing to do
with strength that's a myth and then you
actually spar with people or do
grappling with people who are high-level
strikers or grapplers
and when a big dude walks in they're
like god damn it they're like what like
nobody's going to want to fight that guy
but it's all technique who the fuck told
you that i don't want that guy hitting
me he could not be the fucking
he could end my fucking career just by
landing on me fuck that
so being big and such this is what
dakota professor dr stone
why do you think they have weight
classes like there's you know once
you're big and strong enough you can
fucking
hurt somebody and if you're really
really weak and you're pushing muscles
the army
you're just probably not gonna fucking
you know what i'm saying be doing a lot
even if you
have really strong hips and stuff
there's only so much momentum you can
put into something that folds over as
soon as you
stand at the top and sorry i won't
belabor this point too much longer but
th this this is one that has a couple of
couple instances that i have seen and
especially in like if you look at
journal strength and conditioning or
some of those other ones where they'll
say
you know kicking and they'll use sports
like rugby soccer and then even like
miss
various forms of martial arts and
they'll be like knee extension do the
knee extension machine it's like
yeah you do knee extend when you kick a
soccer ball or you kick a rugby ball or
you kick somebody else in the face but
is that really where all the power is
coming from like not really a little bit
it's really coming from the leg that's
still on the ground that's pushing up
into the ground and trying to
swing your whole body and your leg
across and hit this guy right that's
where the power is coming from
so you'll see a lot of silly stuff like
that where it's like make sure you do
those
skull crushers for the maximum punching
power it's like yeah that will help a
little bit but that you're if you're
overlooking some of the bigger ticket
items you're probably wasting your time
100 show me a guy with a
baller close grip show me a guy who can
close grip incline 405 and i'm never
fighting that guy in my life
should show me a guy who can skull crush
a lot i'm like i don't know maybe
what were we talking about a couple
weeks ago somebody was saying like
should you be able to like push press
like yes three fifteen
fifteen no no not push press it's a
strict press
oh yeah like that if yeah you see that
guy show up to sparring you're like nah
nah don't fight that guy i need a new
gym yeah 100
um all right inti castro
castro wow this is great you and i have
this is simple
i think we're back on the same so far
it's the same
thank goodness wow that was great for a
while thanks youtube
uh into castro says question for dr
james
you commented a couple weeks ago that
you had uh to do some serious oops some
some
serious i made up some research that
dipped into learning considering that
you
god i just can't read considering that
that and
your sports science background i thought
you could give some insights or
recommendations about what kind of
sports or style
of training is best for complementing a
highly cognitive capacity demanding
lifestyle
whether it's actually improving
cognitive function reducing stress
promoting oxidation etc
also in the case you could actually
afford to have a week or two of mental
and physical fatigue
and decide to go for hypertrophy
training what advice would you give in
order to deal
uh or cope with reduced mental capacity
in that part of the meso
holy shit so i don't even understand
what the first question is let me back
up a little bit
so the first question is do you have any
insights or recommendations of what kind
of sports or training styles
are best to potentially enhance
cognitive function
my suspicion is there's no sports that
enhance cognitive function
other than general physical activity
going on walks and lifting weights and
shit like that going for a swim yes i
mean like general exercise is shown to
have an effect on you know your ability
to do various kind of like
learning or memorization tasks but it's
kind of like a very low dose response
thing like
like mike said you go for a walk or you
do some weight training and you pretty
much check that box
the thing is like i would like to be
able to say like you have a lot of
sports that have a lot of moving parts
and a lot of moving parts that are
incredibly unpredictable
the problem is is like although yes it
will enhance your
your like your reaction and predictive
abilities it's just within the context
of whatever it is you're doing so for
example
rugby 15 on 15 right that means
you have 14 people on your side that you
don't always know what's going on you
have 15 people on the other side you
don't always know what's going on you
have to be able to read the field and
react to whatever's happening
in that moment does that get your wheels
turning a bit absolutely but it only
makes the wheels turn in terms of the
context of rugby it's not going to help
you solve math problems or do anything
else like remember your grocery list so
i it's an interesting question i can't
think of any specific
you know exercise or sporting stuff that
would carry over
into more general lifestyle mike can you
think of anything because i really can't
no and i suspect that other than general
physical activity
there's probably no such thing yeah and
then the second question let's see
if you can afford to have a week or two
of mental and physical
fatigue and decide to go for hypertrophy
training what advice would you give in
order to deal or cope with the reduced
mental capacity
in that part of the meso so basically
saying like you have some heart training
coming up but you're also like
dealing with some stuff that requires a
lot of your focus and attention how do
you deal with that is that
am i reading kind of reading that right
yep well the good news
about hypertrophy training is that you
can get a lot out of a little now you'll
hear mike and i preach about sfr mind
muscle connection
and unfortunately those are things that
require a lot of attention and focus
when you're actually exercising
but the good news is if you're an
intermediate lifter picking things up
and putting them down with reasonably
good technique
pretty much gets you 80 of the way there
for the most part
so you can afford to tune out a little
bit although i don't recommend it from
like in terms of
getting the best gains and minimizing
injury um
if you're having a hard time really all
you got to do is just show up
you know you got some sets to get on
each muscle and you can kind of just go
through the motions and at that point
you might be doing a bit more
movement training than muscle training
but that's okay
you don't have to sweat it this is
something i wouldn't explicitly factor
into
um like a training mesocycle or a
fatigue management program
i would just take it day by day and use
auto regulation where if you find that
you're and this actually happened to me
the other day um where there was a bunch
of shit going on
and i had a hard i had like a peak week
training session i had to get through
and i had to triage my stuff and i had
my panda planner thing
and i just was looking at it and i was
like i don't have the attention
to actually went to the garage started
warming up
and my mind was everywhere else but
lifting right i was thinking about all
the shit that i had to do and i said you
know what
canning it i'm gonna stop lifting i'm
gonna i got other things to do i'm gonna
come back and do this later
that's auto regulation right that's just
i just had other bigger fish to fry
that's what you got to do and that's how
i would approach that just auto regulate
the situation
whatever attention that you can use use
and if you don't have any despair
save it pick it up later
great answers james next up
jacob mess
right there perfect jacob
jacob says asks
what alterations could a beginner make
to a standard newbie beginner program
so the thing is we don't know what your
program is so this is going to be a
tough question to answer
um once he has been training for a while
six to 12 months loves to train
got us all technology and has good
knowledge understanding application of
science-based training
but could still not be class
intermediate could this be the time to
increase volume intensity
and start implementing some more
advanced programming approaches maybe
not out of necessity but just to spice
things up a bit so
we'll just answer on necessity because
james and i hate spicing for the purpose
of spicing it's not our job or sports
scientists
um if you want something in your in a
fun way hire a personal trainer bounce
supposed
all around uh just kidding sort of but
on a serious note here you go
probably the first place i would start
is an increase in frequency okay as a
beginner you may be training three or
four days a week
you get much higher quality training
training four or five days a week
because you can split up the volume
more it can allow you to do more volume
don't drive the volume on purpose
but it will allow you to do more high
quality if the auto regulation calls for
another thing is once you increase your
frequency a little bit i would also
try to work on your relative effort so
now that your technique is really good
try to push a little closer to failure a
little closer failure each week
of a meso and really challenge yourself
you used to stop it oh
no that's it i can't do one more try one
more safely try one more rep
and then it turns out like you haven't
gotten too weak yet
you haven't gotten any weaker you're
like okay i'll do another week and then
you push again and you hit another pr
the other week and you find out like
you've been under training for a long
time and you have
pushed you so much further than you
could ever go or are you pushing
you know reality slaps you back to life
and you're like oh good good to know i
am training hard enough
and then my last recommendation just
three to throw out you
is um try experimenting with some
different exercises
uh to get a feel for what sfrs they have
like you always done bent rows always
overhand
because that's your beginner that's what
you wanted to do great technique you got
strong on it
try some underhand easy bar bent rows uh
try some on the machine charge machine
rows
and then maybe like after a month on the
machine you're like this sucks
or maybe you're like this is great and
now it's just another option for me to
use
you try an easy uh bar underhand row and
it sucks for a while then you widen your
grip and it's amazing
and then you have a keeper right so
because a lot of the difference between
a beginner
and the end of the beginner and the
beginning of advanced
is at the beginning of when you call
yourself advanced you should know
damn well what movements work well for
you and damn well which ones don't
like james and i like if you give us the
program we'll be like yeah not doing
that definitely doing that
more of that and then not doing that
because we know what works we're
advanced we have to
for a beginner you know james iraq
beginner clients back when you maybe
weren't as good of a coach like so what
do you prefer like front squats or leg
press
they're like is there answer you're like
right you have no idea
what am i doing so so that's what those
are i get the
kind of the opposite the same problem a
lot where it's like i really prefer
front squats like why don't you just try
leg presses like no i really want the
front squats like just do the leg
presses and shut up and like whoa
leg press is so great like yeah yeah
exactly because they just haven't had
enough experience on them so
uh so the three recommendations i make
is increase frequency
push the relative effort a little bit
and experiment with different exercises
to start
cataloging your top sfr moves and making
sure you're really collecting all the
coins at the gym so to speak yeah that's
great answer experimenting with sfr is
always a good use of your time even as
an advanced person always playing around
with that just a little bit
um i do think there is kind of some some
merit to the the anecdote of
if it ain't broke don't fix it like if
you're having good training things are
going well and you're training
doing good beginner training and you're
getting good gains the goal is not to
push yourself into the intermediate
category to is that's not what you want
what you want is to keep get milking
those gains as long as you can
and then make the change out of
necessity like there's plenty of shit i
wish i could still do i wish i could
still grow over from deadlifts because
i'm genetically suited for deadlifting
but now i can't do it anymore because it
fucks me up so bad right
it's one of those things like you don't
necessarily it's not um you're not
striving
for these training age milestones they
just kind of come as a result of your
training they just
happen um so don't necessarily try to
push yourself into those categories
if it ain't broke don't fix it um you
know what mike you brought up
i'm glad you said that good well i was
thinking about
last time you had said something about
when um goku was training gohan on how
to go super saiyan right
uh from from a need i was going to ask
you
did you watch dragon ball super yet
no i'm still behind i i i won't spoil it
but this might incentivize you to watch
it
so vegeta starts mentoring like
alternate world
say a god saiyan guy and he oh yeah that
guy
he teaches him how to go super saiyan
but
in a different way and i'll leave it at
that
[Music]
and i think i think you'll like it yeah
um
oh hold on i got it uh
yoshi subnautica is great i find it
really relaxing
yeah man great game actually after last
week's uh
episode milo messaged me right away like
dude you played something
i was like yeah yeah dude
i'm glad you enjoyed gamer nerds
gamer um although no one's ever said
that because
almost always gamers if they sound like
that um
james note to self i have to talk to you
right after this
i have something funny that's not
podcastable got it
okay last question for the date you're
gonna scroll uh down pretty far james is
you might as well just search for it
john
like j-o-n or a-o-h-n
j-o-h oh good working-class name
oh got it boom james this one's all
yours
can cold slash can cold exposure slash
therapy
meaningfully increase total energy
temperature
i don't think so i mean i it's one of
those uh
unless you're doing it for like hours
per day
yeah i think it's a drop in the bucket
uh because you're is that really therapy
at that point
right i mean that's just like living
outside at that point um
i think like acutely like would it
increase your energy expenditure
sure but like in the scale of like total
daily
intake and output it's just such a small
amount it's probably insignificant
i think like if you live somewhere
that's cold and you spend a lot of time
outside then yes that's probably
something noteworthy comparatively to
living in like a more temperate area
but yeah this in this case no i don't
think so
your body's also really good are
regulating meat so unless you
cap your knee by stopping or something
if your body is spending a lot more
energy one way it's going to make you
sit down more often and all this other
stuff
so i would uh it's just not this is like
you know drinking cold water burns more
calories yeah burns five more calories
for five minutes
yeah i mean it's kind of like just
taking a shower affects your tdee like
yeah i guess
but i don't think about it because i
shower every day
yeah and and we're assuming john that
you're not just trying to lose weight at
all costs but you're trying to train
as well uh cold therapy is terrible for
training during hypertrophy it
cancels out your gains to some extent
and also even if it doesn't do so
directly in some capacity you time it
such that it doesn't
it's it's uh it's fatiguing uh
like especially to the extent it would
require to meaningfully increase your
total energy expenditure and we're
talking about like it's a lot of
you being cold and a lot of your body's
like well we could be parasympathetic
dominant and recover you but we're
sympathetic dominant all the time
because we're fucking
freezing to death you don't leave an
athlete out in the cold tundra for two
days come back and pick them up
ready for the olympics he's like yep i'm
so recovered like get out of here
yeah you know what i'm i i tolerate the
cold really well like it's in the 20s
and 30s out here and
for me like i just put a jacket on and
i'm pretty comfortable but i cannot
i cannot do the ice bath i am a total
puss when it comes to that i cannot do
the ice bath i i'm that guy who like
puts a foot in he's like no
no no no no i'm saying here man fuck
that it hurts the soul
it hurts it sucks it hurts your whole
body
doesn't stop oh my skin like something
deep inside you is like
i am yeah no no no no oh
yeah i can't but i'm so glad that the
benefits of that are essentially dick
uh in just a couple cases isn't actually
beneficial because
did you see it all the time it's funny
because we we wrote the recovery book
years ago
and you know lots of people have read it
but they're the people that probably
didn't need to read it because they
already knew a lot of that stuff and
didn't do dumb shit i mean not not all
but like i i will say um
there's so many people i see on
instagram and everything
for like promoting like the stupid uh
cold
uh chambers and stuff right like fucking
cryotubes
and i'm just like they're like getting
in my workouts and recovery is important
try cryotherapy.net and just like
what are you doing your bodybuilder like
you should never be doing this there's a
ton of bodybuilders with cupping
scars now we're doing back shots i'm
like you fucking idiot
like i stopped like policing that stuff
too people used to be like
what do you think dr james and they'd be
like i think it's dumb and they're like
oh what
like why are you doing that like because
it would come right like
no what are you doing uh yeah it's what
like there are select uses for it but if
you're just training for physique or
bodybuilding or anything along those
lines like
no no thanks and it sucks
okay well i think that's it for this one
guys uh we have excellent questions as
usual thanks for contributing we really
appreciate when you guys ask us thought
provoking questions and keep us
on our toes dr mike you got anything
going on
uh finishing up the approach free book
yes
yes who knows
all right i don't know if i have
anything going on i know i'm i'm we're
we're all hands on deck on the
hypertrophy book so
keeping an eye on that i know mel's got
a book coming out soon i know she's i i
don't want to
i don't know if i'm gonna am i allowed
to talk about or no no okay well mel's
got a book coming out soon so keep your
eyes peeled for that
um yeah that's all i can think of so
make sure you guys subscribe
thanks for hanging out with us and we'll
see you next time
