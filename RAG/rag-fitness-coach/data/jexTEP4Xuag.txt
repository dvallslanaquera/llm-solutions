i remember going to parties in high
school and having a meal replacement
packet in my back pocket
and then going into the bathroom and
eating the powder out of the packet
just to get my protein it just
completely ridiculous and unnecessary

what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
in this video today something a little
bit different i'm going to be reacting
to my own bodybuilding forum post
that i didn't even know still existed
until very recently um i used one of
those archive scraping tools to dig
these up
and they're from 2001 to 2003 so
like 20 years ago pretty much back when
i was between the ages of
14 to 16 and was in my first few years
of lifting
and i went through these and it was
pretty much like reading something
written by a totally different person
in a different lifetime it's not even
really recognizable to me now
but i thought some of these were pretty
funny some of them are definitely a
little bit
cringy uh and a couple of them are
actually pretty decent in terms of the
actual training advice that i was giving
to other people but
i figured this would make for an
entertaining video i'll sprinkle in some
actual
practical advice here as well and uh
honestly some of this stuff is
a little bit embarrassing even though i
was basically a kid at the time
um i was kind of blunt with my responses
to people at times so i'm not going to
show
the exact forum links or the username
but i promise you these are all 100
real and i'm gonna try to weed them
together as best as i can here
so first up someone posts and asks
people to share why they got into
lifting in the first place and
my response was i was a skinny little
and it ate away at my confidence one day
i was looking in the mirror and i
decided enough was
enough i would get huge no matter how
hard it was and i would never quit
and that was that so yeah that pretty
much is true um i actually remember the
exact moment when i decided that i was
gonna start training seriously it was
literally like
a light switch just went off in my head
it was in one single moment in time
where i was just like that's it enough
is enough game over this is a done deal
i'm going all in on this bodybuilding
thing i'm gonna learn what to do and
then i'm gonna do it
no matter what it takes and that's that
and i took it really seriously even at
13 years old i was doing um
low volume high intensity style training
at that time you know every single set
to all-out failure and
um i definitely went overboard with it
thinking that the harder and harder i
trained the more gains i was going to
make
for example someone asked on the forum
about high intensity training
and what to expect from it yeah it'll
mess you up
like after i'm done a set of squats and
the bar is down on the pins
i get back under the bar and then drive
the weight with all the force i can for
about 20 seconds
the pain is incredible so yeah i'd go do
my squats go to
all out rpe 10 0 rir failure until the
bar would
fall down onto the safety pins and then
i would just stay there in a squatting
position and push up against the weight
as hard as i could for another 20
seconds
um i think i eventually increased that
to 30 seconds which
is just really crazy and unnecessary but
my whole mentality at that time was
centered around lifting
as intensely as i possibly could at one
time i didn't even have a squat rack uh
keep in mind that i was training at home
for the first couple years
so i just had to improvise as best i
could yo i work out at home and i do
have a way of getting the bar onto my
shoulders but it's a huge hassle
i have to use two rocks in my backyard
and i have to haul all the weights over
there
does anybody know any sights on the net
where i can get a cheap squat rack
i remember i used to pile all of my
weights into a wheelbarrow
wheel them over onto the section on the
lawn where there were these two really
big rocks
and then i'd have to balance the bar
across the rocks even though they
weren't even
awkwardly unrack it do my squats go to
all-up failure of course
drop the weight off my back onto the
lawn um there were these big holes in
the lawn where i dropped the weights
and then i'd have to reset the whole
thing in order to do the next set
i remember even doing this in the snow
sometimes during winter i was just
totally obsessed with lifting at that
time in my life and
this next post is pretty cringy but just
to give you an idea
somebody else makes a post talking about
how obsessed they are with bodybuilding
and i reply man i know exactly what
you're talking about
i have the exact same problem if that's
what you want to call it when it comes
to bodybuilding it's all i think about
from the time i wake up in the morning
to when i go to bed
bodybuilding is on my mind the whole day
if there was something i could do to
ease it up a bit i would it really isn't
healthy when you think about it but
there's nothing i can do
a lot of times i don't want to go out
because i'm afraid i won't be able to
eat properly it's pathetic
i read somewhere that the workout should
revolve around your life your life
shouldn't revolve around the workout
but i'm obsessed it's sad really yeah
that's just how my mind
has always worked when i decide that i'm
going to go do something you know when i
have a certain
big goal that i want to achieve it just
becomes complete tunnel vision
complete obsession and i just go as deep
as possible on that one thing
and everything else just pretty much
gets blocked out as far as bodybuilding
goes
i'm definitely past that now i just
turned 35 recently
training is still an important part of
my life but it's more so just something
that i do
as part of my routine i'm not like
excessively wrapped up in it
it's not my goal to be massive and
shredded
my tunnel vision now is more directed
toward the
business side of things and in helping
other people reach their fitness goals
but at that time bodybuilding was just
an all-consuming passion
and a lot of times when you are super
wrapped up in the aesthetic side of
things especially if you're starting out
skinny or overweight
body dysmorphia is not an uncommon thing
to varying degrees
oh yeah i know man like do you ever get
that feeling where you think you've
gotten smaller and when you look in the
mirror you actually think you look
smaller but your measurements are
exactly the same
i always get that the idea of being
skinny is so far in the past
that i don't identify with it at all
anymore but i do remember that it took
me quite a few years to
uh really snap out of that when i first
started lifting even though objectively
i had a pretty solid physique especially
for my age
and i was pretty strong too but i just
had that sort of skinny guy mentality
ingrained in my head
and so for the first probably five plus
years of training
i just wanted to get bigger and bigger
and bigger recently i've been so
motivated to gain more size that i'll
try just about anything so
i decided to start having a protein
shake in the middle of the night since
that's when most of the growth is taking
place and it makes
no sense to not go two to three hours
without protein during the day
and then fast for nine plus hours at
night i remember i would
set my alarm for four am force myself
out of sleep walk all the way down to
the hall into the kitchen
to mix up a protein shake in the middle
of the night i think at one point i was
even eating
uh tuna straight out of the can which is
just completely ridiculous and it
actually
really messed up my sleep at the time i
was getting really tired during the day
falling asleep in class and so uh yeah i
didn't keep that up for too long uh the
sleep disruption probably had a negative
impact on my results
but those are the lengths that i was
going to even at 15 years old just to
try to get a bit more muscle growth
and i had such a perfectionist attitude
with it when
things didn't go my way i would get very
very unhappy oh my god i'm so pissed off
right now
i just came back from a week off
training only to find that my left
shoulder is now weaker for some reason
when doing my dumbbell presses my left
arm kept lagging behind
and i would have to quit the set without
really hitting true failure i was so
pissed off that i threw my dip stand
into the
into the forest a perfectly good workout
wasted
now that i think about it my downstairs
workout area
and the fence that overlooked the forest
that we live next to those were like a
good
probably 12 paces apart so it's not like
i just grabbed the dip stand
and then threw it out of impulse i would
have had to have picked it up walked
down the balcony stairs
then walked all the way over to the
fence and then thrown it over the fence
down the ravine into
the forest like at no point during that
entire walk
did i come to my senses and think that
maybe i shouldn't throw this perfectly
good dip stand into the bushes
but anyway despite the fact that i was
clearly a bit overboard with my lifting
obsession at that time
i will say that i did have the right
general attitudes towards training
even though i got a lot of the smaller
details wrong for example someone asks
about
lifting with lighter weight and training
for the pump and i say
the idea is overload not fatigue
training with low reps allows you to
handle the most weight
prevent lactic acid buildup and it's
also much easier to concentrate on
overload is to present the muscles with
a workload that is beyond their present
capacity so if you did six reps of 100
pounds one week
and then six pounds of 105 pounds the
next week you've just overloaded your
muscles
fatigue just means training your muscles
to the point of exhaustion like 15 easy
reps with a light weight
so this is something that i still talk
about pretty often um i actually have a
video from not too long ago talking
about
overload versus fatigue um i don't agree
with 15 year old sean that you must
train with low reps
back then i used to do really low reps
with almost everything in
pretty much the four to six range like
max ot style for those that remember
that style of training but i do think
that more moderate rep ranges probably
somewhere around the 5 to 10 zone
i think that's a good zone to base the
bulk of your training around
you can watch this video after for a
more detailed explanation of why that
is but regardless of the exact reference
that you use
cranking out a bunch of lightweight pump
sets is definitely not the way to go
your main focus needs to be on getting
within a few reps of true mechanical
muscular failure
and progressing over time yeah that's
pretty much the whole idea behind it all
every week you should be able to
increase the weight in reps progression
equals growth assuming you have a proper
diet now you're not necessarily going to
progress
every single week though i would say
that novices should be progressing in
some form
during most weeks even if it's just a
single extra rep but it's definitely
true
that progression equals growth and
progression is where your focus should
be
if your performance in the gym is
steadily going up that's the best
indicator you have that your muscle size
is also increasing okay the fact that
you're consistently getting stronger is
direct evidence of hypertrophy
because size and strength are for the
most part directly intertwined
so even though i was probably a bit off
base back then in terms of
my exact execution of things you know i
was probably too far on the sort of
intensity side of the spectrum
my technique on some lifts i know was
wrong i trained with really low
frequencies as well
i probably could have benefited from a
bit more exercise variation
but i did understand the overarching
principles that building muscle is all
about beating your training logbook over
time
and i also knew that a lot of the other
things that people were focusing on
like the pump and the burn and soreness
i knew that those things
mostly didn't matter i'm not sure why i
got so worked up about it
soreness is not an indicator of a
successful workout that was in reply to
someone saying that uh they tried a new
chest workout
and they were amazed at how sore it made
them somebody else also
asks what the best sculpting exercises
are for their triceps
there is no such thing as a sculpting
exercise here's a bit more of a
reasonable reply when somebody asks
about muscle burn
burn is simply caused by a buildup of
lactic acid a waste product of anaerobic
work it will do absolutely nothing in
the way of helping you gain more mass
focus on progression not burn as long as
you are progressing
then you're doing fine again i'd say
that's mostly correct
uh muscle burn is actually caused by a
buildup of hydrogen ions in the muscle
not
lactic acid specifically it might play
some role in muscle hypertrophy
uh but regardless it's not the limiting
factor in the process and it's not
something that you need to specifically
strive for
another thing you don't need to strive
for which i talk about quite a bit these
days and apparently i knew this back
then as well
is performing a ton of volume and
exercise variations for your biceps
i don't know why i responded like such a
dick here but
someone posts their workout split and
asks for feedback and it's a five day
split
and on friday it just says biceps and
he says what do you guys think and i say
i think it sucks
why would you dedicate a whole day to
your biceps so i probably could have
replied in a nicer way but
i wouldn't say that i was wrong there's
no reason to have a dedicated biceps
only day
it's the smallest major muscle group on
your entire body
and you can build it optimally off of
fairly straightforward training
but what i was wrong about in many
respects was the nutrition side of
things now um i give myself a break for
that because
almost everybody back then was wrong
about a lot of stuff on the nutritional
side and we did all kinds of things that
uh we know now are unnecessary but at
that time it was just considered to be
the standard approach
for example somebody asks if apples are
okay to eat after training
nope apples are not a good choice
post-workout
they may be simple carbs but their
glycemic index scale rating is low
meaning they are not absorbed quickly
you want carbs high on the gi scale so
almost everybody used to think that you
needed to slam a post-workout chair
consisting of
whey protein and rapidly digested carbs
and that you had to drink it within 30
minutes of finishing your workout
to kickstart recovery and replenish
muscle glycogen
in reality standard weight training
workouts only use up a small portion of
your total glycogen stores
and there's no need to immediately
replenish them anyway unless you were
say an athlete who was training multiple
times per day
there's no explicit need for
post-workout carbs at all really just
get in some high quality protein within
a few hours
and that's pretty much it another thing
you don't need to obsess over is meal
frequency
and definitely not the idea that if you
don't eat for two to three hours during
the day
that you're gonna go catabolic and start
losing muscle
somebody asks how often they should eat
during the day and i say
just get a watch and time it to count
down for two hours
then after you eat just time it again
for another two hours so if any
bodybuilding nutrition myth ever this is
the one
that adversely affected my life the most
because i literally thought that if i
wasn't eating protein every two to three
hours
that i was gonna lose muscle so i went
probably
i would say eight years following that
particular guideline
constantly worrying about how long it
had been since i last ate
and making sure that i had my next meal
lined up to consume it right around that
three hour mark
i remember going to parties in high
school and having a meal replacement
packet in my back
pocket and then going into the bathroom
and eating the powder out of the packet
just to get my protein in just
completely ridiculous and unnecessary
this is also one of the big reasons why
i'm so passionate about dispelling
different myths and misinformation
because that stuff genuinely negatively
affects people's lives and i think back
to
when i was still a novice and how that
stuff personally affected me
if i had known this one thing if i had
known that as long as you get enough
total protein for the day as a whole
and you just kind of generally space it
out three feedings is probably enough
for maximum growth
or at least near maximum growth if i had
just known that
that would have significantly changed my
day-to-day life
i would have had a lot less dietary
anxiety and i could have been
way more chill with things and gotten
the exact same results instead i was
sitting around
over analyzing every little detail that
didn't even matter at all in the big
picture
i also had that mindset that food is
just fuel
and i used to choke down really bland
meals even foods that i genuinely hated
because they were considered to be
bodybuilding staples tuna was the best
example of that i just opened the can
and stick a fork in it
pretty sick and it takes like half an
hour to eat but again despite uh
all these goofy things that i did i
still made very good gains you know you
can do
a hundred unnecessary things but as long
as you're doing let's say the 10
main necessary things you're still going
to get great results
you'll just get them way less
efficiently and that's why just because
you see some jack dude online
and they tell you that they're doing x y
and z
that doesn't automatically mean that x y
and z are all responsible for their
gains
maybe it's just x that's getting them
the bulk of the results
and then y and z aren't having a
negative impact but they're just totally
unnecessary and they're not having a
positive impact either and that's why
you shouldn't just blindly copy
everything that somebody else does
um you still have to do your research
and you have to weigh things out
logically first
but yeah the gains definitely did come
and at a fast enough pace that i ended
up getting stretch marks pretty much
uh covering my entire body i still have
them today and for some reason i thought
that that made me
a pretty hardcore i really had that
mindset where i thought that
bodybuilding was this super badass
pursuit
and that training was like going to war
somebody asked how to get rid of stretch
marks
and i reply who cares they're sweet i
have them everywhere
think of them as badges of honor war
wounds symbols of hard work
supplements were also an area that i
knew very little about
and just like a lot of lifters do i
definitely got sucked down the
supplement marketing rabbit hole and
even though i was a young teen with very
little money
i would spend what little money i did
have on useless garbage that i didn't
even need
rims a spoiler and neon lighting for my
honda civic were
one of those things and worthless
supplements were another
i just bought some glutamine and bcaas
to take in order to protect my muscle
tissue while playing rugby i'm just
wondering how i should go about taking
them how much should i take
how long before and after my games
thanks so if you're new here and you
haven't seen my previous videos then
just to be clear
bcaas and glutamine are a complete waste
of money as long as you're eating enough
total protein
because if you're doing that then you're
going to get all the bcaas and the
glutamine that you need just from your
regular diet
all i really needed to do at that time
was to just make sure that i was getting
in
some protein within a couple hours of my
rugby games and some protein afterwards
and i would have been fine
there was a lot of other garbage that i
wasted my money on as well
i took testosterone boosters weight
gainers nitric
oxide boosters the one legit supplement
that i did use though was creatine or at
least
i wanted to use creatine but initially
there was one thing stopping me
i've decided that i want to use creatine
but my mom won't let me
she's caught up in the whole creatine is
bad for you deal she said the only way i
can use it is if i show her statements
by credible people
meaning not supplement companies that
say that creatine use is safe
can someone help me out who here takes
creatine any need for concern when using
it
anyone had any negative side effects
from it thanks so i remember trying to
convince my mom to drive me to gnc to
get some creatine but
she just wasn't having it she was okay
with protein powder and i still remember
her taking me to the store to buy my
very first tub
but creatine was a no-go so eventually
when my parents went on vacation i took
the car even though i only had my
learner's license at the time
i drove to the mall and i bought the
creatine myself
and somebody else posts on the forum
saying that his mom won't allow him to
use creatine either
and i reply dude i was in the exact same
situation
i just hide it in a cupboard downstairs
they don't even know i'm using it but
who cares
see usually i would feel bad lying to my
parents but this is different
they don't understand my commitment and
love for lifting it's my body so i will
make my own choices
and then lastly this is unrelated to all
the previous ones but
even to this day one of the most common
questions that people ask me
and one of the top google searches that
sends people to my blog because i have
an article about it
is does masturbation reduce testosterone
or
does masturbation affect muscle growth
and people have been asking this
question for decades
and apparently it used to really
frustrate me even back then someone on
the forum asks
will masturbation slow down my gains and
i say
oh my god how many threads are there
going to be about masturbation and test
levels this is ridiculous
if you want to jerk off then jerk off
it's not going to affect your gains
