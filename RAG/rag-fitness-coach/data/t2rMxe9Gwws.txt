[Music]
hello i know my own name it's dr mike
izzertel but i learned another name
today it's ifb pro figure ashley
lockamosky and my friend ifb pro also
jared feather and uh we're here to work
out with ashley but i'm really nervous
because jared's here great camera
presence mike good job thanks anyway
jared please take over uh so ashley is
preparing for a contest we want to say
which one mm-hmm i'm going to show open
surprise you know what i'm
saying oh i said the b word but i don't
think we're good
but
today ashley is doing her final vertical
pulling session for her messa cycle
before she moves into a deload we will
probably be utilizing a few intensity
techniques
just to make the session a little bit
shorter and because she's super fatigued
traveling for the arnold classic in ohio
this weekend we want to kind of mitigate
some of that
axial loading which is why we shifted to
the vertical pulling session and we'll
be utilizing those techniques um midway
through the session but she is excited
and pumped and jacked and
ready to get this going
gee whiz ma'am you sure are a full
looking lady oh boy
oh
gee whiz
let's do it
first exercise today is going to be the
assisted overhand pull-up ashley has
been doing these through her messa cycle
machine's a little different than the
one she uses back in muscle factory in
san antonio so we will be
just trying to figure out what load
she's going to use today she's in the
10-15 rep range for the assisted pull up
and i think she'll probably be using
about 40 50 pounds of assistance so
four sets
10 to 15 reps
let's keep going
more she got tons more
all day
good
oh yeah good three more let's go
big pull
one
stretch slow
up
two stretch
slow up
three more you got more two more let's
make it happen hard workout last one of
the mezzo big ones no body language
straight up go just pick up yes slow as
if you're gonna do another slow slow
slow stretch and get out
[Music]
that's all i knew there you go
he's like kick it out good stuff you
just let go and fly out
good stuff
good stuff
so you so you don't get ingrowns you get
ingrowns
let me clear this up really quick are we
on camera
okay exfoliation
ingrowns whatever
lies by the dermatological industry and
the makeup industry illuminati triangle
to try to get you to spend money on
looking beautiful i'm gonna tell you
guys something for real for real you
look great you don't need all the skin
care and look at me look how
beautiful my skin is
all i ever put on this body
is love and that's real
mike's skin tips
boom
accelerate out of the bottom don't jerk
accelerate yes
smooth rise
slow stretch smooth rise yes don't drink
in the bottom
let it stretch
hang out for a second
there you go good
four more
one no bs
smooth up
too good use those lats come up higher
[Music]
three one last one
big moves go go go go go go go go go go
go good yes slow and that's it good
stuff
you're going to fall out backwards when
it's like very good
very good
so like i mentioned ashley is using a
different machine that she normally uses
your muscles don't exactly care about
the weights that the machine says they
care about the tension detected so what
we're doing is last week she got
12 reps on her first set we picked a
load that we think she'll get about 12
to 13 because the rir goes down
obviously last week's used two in the
tank so this week she should be able to
get about 13 reps on this first set
if we pick the load correctly then it's
literally the same load as the last
machine to use just
it's going to read differently the
machine's completely different so as
long as you can warm up enough to where
you can detect
similar loading on machine to machine
variation you're fine don't worry about
it being like well i use 100 last week
and on this machine 100 is way too
 heavy so i can't really do it
yeah well you're not going to be able to
because it's different the machines are
different so today we picked
like i said she's using 40 to 50 pounds
of resistance at muscle factory because
that's a different machine this is
actually 110 pounds of resistance on
this one to assist her
[Music]
yes
that's it
let me try one more
all right
i tried i attempted that was good that
was good
damn film guy
next exercise is going to be overhand
lap pull downs we'll be doing a giant
set to 60 reps um probably gonna use
somewhat of a shorter rest period so
that way we're at least
utilizing intensity technique here
she was doing uh down sets of the
assisted overhand pull-ups but i don't
want to do too much again since we're
traveling she's super fatigued she's
kind of ready to deload um
so we're just going to do this giant set
it'll be a little bit lighter and then
after that we'll go into our horizontal
exercise and then lateral dots and
biceps and we'll be done
yes exactly
[Music]
oh yeah all day ash
big lats one way or another
come on good
pull harder
hold fast yes good two more
pull fast

[Music]

power on the way down
good stuff
that's it
oh bonus round yeah jk
ah it's like it's like we that was dirty
like we knew we were gonna fail very
good stuff
what's next mr jared
[Music]
we changed the final exercise to a
machine row instead of the one arm
dumbbell row
just because again we're gonna be
utilizing some intensity techniques she
uh
had like four sets of one-arm dumbbell
rows and she's like hey i might not be
able to do that so
uh audible we're gonna be doing probably
two or three sets here machine rows the
first set we're gonna try to rep match
the mile reps for the rest of the sets
so
15 to 20 on the first set myra pauses
for the subsequent one or two sets that
we do after that depending on how she's
feeling
some folks will say that a proper row
you want to keep your scapulae locked in
so this would be the bottom and this
would be the top
which is like a fine thing to do if you
want to work a pretty small part of your
back you work in the lats not remotely
the optimal angle tear is major works
okay
but the way jared and i like to do these
is the bottom
you
arch forward
stretching your erector spinae
stretching your rhomboids your middle
traps
even uh your for sure your lower traps
some upper trap as well and then when
you come back you arch the whole thing
pulling your scapula back so it's
scapulae forward spine rounded
then spine arch scapulae back what that
does is it trains all of the muscles
that power those motions which happens
to be like
65 of your back
the lats are important they're part of
your back but we train with 50 trillion
other exercises not that hard to figure
out how to train
the rest of your back if you're moving a
lot
that's what trains it if you're always
stationary you're robbing yourself with
a lot of good growth
is it easier to do it the other way of
course because you're not using a ton of
that heavy musculature if you use
this method it's going to suck but then
you're going to wake up one day and your
back is going to have its own name its
own billing zip code its own tax forms
and you're going to be like holy i
did it
13.
got four more
14.

thanks guys
next up we're gonna do machine lateral
raises she's going to do
15 to 20 on the first set and then we
will be mile rep uh matching for that
first set uh whatever rep achievement
she gets three sets here so the last two
are going to be the moderate pauses
first one is going to be her
reps achieved set so
um this and then a curling exercise and
we are done
let's go

the next exercise last exercise of the
day is going to be a cable curl she's
only doing two sets of cable curls
figure women still train their biceps
although they don't need to be humongous
they're not physique athletes so we
still give her a little bit of a bicep
stimulus every
you know two days or so so she does
about three times a week
but again the sets are pretty minimal
the frequency is high um so two sets
here straight sets 15 to 20 rep range
and then we're done
good move closer to the machine just by
a stop good eyes that
no curling over we're using biceps only
one more good rep
