hey there rp
plus rpu welcome back dr james hoffman
here
as always and today we're going to be
looking at our third video in our
movement anatomy series and this one's
going to be relatively easy going so
today our goal is to talk a little bit
more about the elbow and the wrist and
hand
so something that's not as nearly as
complicated as we've already talked
about in the shoulder
but still there are some noteworthy
structures muscles and actions that we
should discuss so let's go ahead and get
started
so no surprise based on what i've
already told you today we're going to
talk about the elbow
the wrist and hand and then i'll give
you some examples just like i did last
time
so let's start with the elbow nice and
easy so the elbow is actually a
conglomerate of three bones that we're
generally going to be talking about the
first is the humerus which is that big
meaty arm bone up top here the radius
which is a smaller bone in the forearm
on the thumb side and the ulna which is
another small
forearm bone on the pinky finger side so
essentially when we're looking at the
elbow
we're looking at the interaction of
those three bones and how they move
around
so the elbow is actually not just kind
of a single joint look we usually think
of as just this kind of like okay here's
the joint this is the axis
it's actually three joints in one we're
actually looking at the way that the
humerus interacts with the ulna
so the humeral ulna we're also looking
at how the humerus interacts with the
radius so the humeral radial joint
and we're also looking at how the radius
interacts with the ulna or sometimes
called the radial ulnar joint
so we actually have three kind of joints
that we're working with now for our
purposes for our ses
majors and future students we're really
just going to be looking at about you
know the gross movement of the elbow
we're not going to be
as concerned about really really finite
movements and that's going to be the
majority of our discussion today so
let's keep going
so when we're talking about movements at
the elbow there's a few primary ones
not like the shoulder where we had a
whole bunch of wacky ones right so when
we're talking about the elbow we're
primarily
talking about sagittal plane movement
which will be flexion and extension
so for flexion that is when the forearm
or my hand
essentially is moving towards the
shoulders and i'm closing the angle
between
my humerus and the radius and ulna
portion of my arms right so for flexion
what we're seeing is the hand comes
towards the shoulder and the joint angle
is getting smaller so if i hold my hand
out straight the joint angle
is getting smaller during flexion during
extension it's quite the opposite right
so i'm starting
with my hand closer to my shoulder up
here and i will be
extending my arm out and opening up this
joint angle to my arm is fully straight
right so with extension
the forearm moves away from the shoulder
and the joint angle of the elbow
increases we can also see some kind of
unique movements here we're going to see
some pronation and supination
so pronation is an internal rotation of
the forearm right so of the radius and
the ulna
where we're going to result in a palms
down finished posture here so
for pronation what i'm going to do is i
can start neutral i can start with my
palms up
and when i'm pronating i'm essentially
moving towards a palms down position
on the other side we have supination
which is kind of the opposite so we're
going to see external rotation of the
forearm
and that's going to result in the radius
and ulna turning over and resulting in a
palms up position
so the stupid way that i think everyone
learns in anatomy physiology and it's
the way that i still think about it
if you get these two confused supination
is like
making a bowl of soup with your hands
supination think
bowl of soup really stupid i know but
that's a really easy way to remember it
so pronation palms down
supination palms up those are going to
be the primary movements that we're
going to talk about
in the elbow now these are very cut and
dry very kind of vector linear movements
we have to keep in mind that real life
movement is usually a combination of
multiple movements right so if you're
thinking about like throwing a baseball
or a shot put or a football or something
like that
we're going to see a combination of
these movements it's not going to be
something that we can just purely
describe as
flexion extension or pronation
supination kind of stuff makes sense
but this gives us a really good basis to
start off of so let's keep going
okay here's our handy table so we talked
about this last time i just want to
remind you
here we have the table that explains
some of the major muscles
and the origin insertions of those
muscles and the actions of those muscles
now for the elbow we have a lot of
different muscles that can act on the
elbow so here are kind of the ones that
are worth noting
so the first one most obvious one that
most of us hopefully are familiar with
are the biceps brachii right it's that
big
meaty portion the one that you make a
muscle and flex right try to show off
for the ladies beach season all that
stuff
this is going to be one of our primary
elbow flexors and it also helps in
supination
one other weird thing that we can see
with the biceps brachii is it does
provide some weak shoulder flexion so
your ability to raise your arm up like
so
right so it doesn't cyst a little bit in
there and you can see again
the origins and insertions here listed
now i'm going to remind you
because it's important is memorizing
the origins and insertions of all these
muscles worth your time
probably not will it make you a better
sport and exercise scientist
absolutely however this information is
readily available to you at any given
time
so if you ever forget what the origin
and insertion of a given muscle group is
you can look it up in an anatomy
physiology textbook or on wikipedia it's
all there for you
so what i would say is if you are not a
like physical therapist
athletic trainer or you don't want to be
a medical doctor orthopedic surgeon or
something like that those are
careers where memorizing this stuff is
actually worth your time
if you are a sport and exercise science
person like a strength coach
personal trainer fitness enthusiast is
it worth your while
it would make you a better student
certainly but it's going to require a
lot of mental resources to memorize
all this stuff and again that's why i
have made a table for you just so you
can reference later on
so if you know all the landmarks and you
can do a little vector analysis
it really helps you understand how the
muscles move however
this information is again readily
available so we have summarized it for
you here
so anyways back to business so the
biceps brachii are going to be one of
our primary elbow flexors
it's going to help us do some supination
and it's also going to help flex the
shoulder a little bit
brachialis is another one that's going
to help us and that's just going to be
almost
exclusively for elbow flexion and we're
going to have some pictures of some of
these up here in a minute
we have the brachioradialis which is
going to be involved again in elbow
flexion and supination
and then on the opposite side of the
body on the posterior side
we have the triceps brachii so biceps
two heads
triceps three heads right so the triceps
is going to be kind of the polar
opposite on this one and this one we're
going to actually see some weak shoulder
extension so our ability to go kind of
past the midline of the body with the
shoulder but it's going to be one of our
primary
elbow extensors right so essentially we
have the biceps are going to be the main
flexors
and then the triceps are going to be the
main extensors so those two muscle
groups are what we call antagonistic
meaning they oppose each other in their
action
makes sense so far hopefully nothing too
crazy so we got some pictures and stuff
coming up a couple more what we have to
touch on
next we have the supinator if you get
this wrong on an exam
i will personally find you and punch you
in the head why
well what do you think the action of the
supinator is
supination right so don't get that one
wrong on a quiz or
on an exam when you're in school because
i will find you
i will find you right so what does
supernature do really easy does
supination again so that's moving
towards a
palms up position we have a couple other
that are noteworthy the pronator
quadratus
which is going to be involved in
pronation so that's the opposite so it's
going to be antagonistic to the
supinator right so we have supination
pronation
and then we have the pronator teres as
the name implies pronation pronator
teres pronation
it's going to help in both pronation and
elbow flexion so some of these are kind
of obvious right so if you see supinator
supination if you see pronator quadratus
or pronator terrais
implies pronation so those ones are kind
of no-brainers hopefully
so let's take a look at the next slide
and we can see some pictures of all
these different muscle groups now
again you can look this up on wikipedia
or you can do a google image search or
you can
find a textbook with all this stuff what
i would encourage you to do at least
for personal practice especially with
these really easy ones like the biceps
look at the origins and insertions note
them and then think about the line of
pull right we know that the muscle can
only shorten it can't forcibly extend it
can only forcibly shorten
and this will really help you understand
how these muscles work right so if you
know
where it starts and where it finishes
and the only way that it can move
you have a pretty good idea of what
muscle action that will be so it's a
good kind of thought experiment for
yourself
as you're going forward and learning all
this stuff on your own so in the
meantime we just want you to be familiar
with the terms and understand what they
do
um go and that's this will be kind of
like your homework from this point on
do that little mini vector analysis find
all those landmarks
see what they look like and then see if
you can imagine making a vector
of that muscle actually contracting
really really useful something i used to
do when i was in school and it really
helped me out a lot
okay so that's the elbow not too bad
most of those muscles we're pretty
familiar with and most of the actions
are pretty self-explanatory
the wrist and hand is a little bit more
complicated we know
that the wrist and hand are composed of
a whole bunch of different muscles and a
whole bunch of different bones
some of them are more and less
noteworthy than others
so when we're talking about what actions
we can expect to see at the wrist and
hand
we're going to pro primarily see what's
on this list here so first we're going
to see kind of wrist
flexion extension right so for wrist
flexion we're going to see
the palm and or the fingers moving
towards the anterior forearm
so essentially i'm trying to bring my
fingers close to my forearm that will be
flexion
extension is going to be the opposite my
palm and fingers will move towards the
posterior side of my forearm so i'll be
kind of doing a wrist up
type position so the back of my hand
trying to touch my forearm that will be
extension
we can see what's called radial
deviation which is essentially kind of
like an abduction type movement where
we're trying to move the hand
in the direction towards the thumb so
i'm trying to close the distance between
my thumb and my forearm
that is radial deviation on the opposite
side we have ulnar deviation where i'm
trying to move my pinky finger
towards my forearm so i'm trying to
close the gap between my pinky and my
forearm
that's ulnar deviation and then of
course we have things like finger
flexion where i'm actually causing my
fingers to close and i have finger
extension where i'm forcibly opening up
my fingers right so hopefully these are
things that we've pretty familiar with
or
at least uh from a day-to-day basis we
kind of know kind of intuitively like
okay i have to close my fingers i have
to open my fingers i have to move my
wrist a certain way
right nothing too surprising there so
those are going to be the major
actions that we're going to talk about
the wrist and hand are made up of a
number of different bones so we can see
on this slide
right we have eight carpal bones that
make up the wrists and they're kind of
small very
cube or irregular shaped bones we have
five metacarpals which are these kind of
medial in medium-sized intermediary
bones that go between the wrists
and they go up into the hand and then
last we have about 14
phalanges which is kind of the upper
portion of your fingertips and fingers
here so
the carpals are the bones in your wrist
the metacarpals are kind of like the big
bones in your hands
and then the phalanges are kind of the
smaller joint bones in your fingers
makes sense now there's a correct number
and sequence of these things
but for our purposes again if you're not
like going into a t or pt ot any of
those kind of things
not a huge deal just be aware of that
they exist right
so if we look at the wrist bones a
little bit more we can see all these
more specifically
now i remember there's a number of
different mnemonic devices you can use
to memorize the name of all these bones
again it's one of those things is it
useful for you as an ses person
maybe for me and this is just my
personal opinion you can take it or
leave it
it requires a lot of mental resources to
keep this kind of information in the
tank for me so for me this was something
that i realized
i can look up very easily it's kind of
like when uh
you're looking at physics equations like
kinematic equations like figuring out
displacements and velocities and time
frames right
does it help you to know calculus yeah
if you know calculus you can derive all
those equations and it makes perfect
sense right
do you need to know calculus no because
you can look it up in a textbook or
something
somewhere else right so it's not a huge
deal so it's one of those things like
how much mental resource do you want to
allocate to that
i would say probably not a lot since
it's information that's readily
available to you okay
so anyways those are the bones of the
wrists it is noteworthy if you are going
to go into athletic training
because this is a common sight of injury
for a lot of sports
now we know that the movement of the
hand
is going to be through coordinated
efforts of both intrinsic muscles of the
hand
and extrinsic muscles that affect the
hand
which is kind of a weird way to think
about it so what we know is there are a
little bit of intrinsic muscles in the
hands and they can actually do some nice
specific finite movements
but most of the movement that we're
going to see in the hand and primarily
in the wrist as well
is going to be through extrinsic muscles
so when we're talking about intrinsic
that means inside the hand
extrinsic muscles are going to be
muscles that are housed in the forearm
which will be affecting the hand and the
fingers right so
primarily we're going to be looking at
our extrinsic muscles now we're trying
to
just make a point here of saying are
there muscles that are also inside the
hand that we should know about for sure
but
for the most part their actions are not
going to be as important as the ones
that we're going to talk about today
which are in the extrinsic portion
and this is not an all-inclusive list by
any means it's just meant to kind of get
you introduced to some of these topics
so for the most part the most important
muscles that are going to be acting on
the hand
and the fingers are going to be in our
extrinsic group
and we can kind of break that down into
two subgroups the first one is kind of
what i like to call the medial
epicondylar groups which are those that
originate on the
medial epicondyle and the lateral
epicondyle group which are those that
generally originate on the lateral
epicondyle what i want you to find first
is the olecranon which is this pointy
part of the elbow it's what most of us
call the funny bone kind of area right
that big pointy bulging part out so once
we find that there's two bony landmarks
that we want to find
right after that so what i would say is
flex your arm to about 90 degrees
right so about 90 degrees make a muscle
and then once you've found the olecranon
just go outside of that to the left and
to the right and feel around a little
bit what you'll find is there's two
big bumps on the inside and on the
outside of your elbow
those are the medial and lateral
epicondyles and that's where a lot of
these muscles are going to be
originating from
so the one on the inside facing the body
right that's the medial one
and the one on the outside got to feel
around for it
is the lateral epicondyle so the reason
why we've done this is we've kind of
categorized them into these two groups
because they share a common origin
excuse me maybe not necessarily a common
insertion
but because their origin is the same a
lot of the muscle actions are very very
similar
so let's take a look at these two groups
huh so the first one is our medial group
and we have a whole number of different
muscles right and
the forearm if you've never studied it
before is complicated
there's a number of different layers and
the muscles very often you cannot
see underneath until you peel off layers
of muscle so
what we find with the forearm is that
there's lots and lots of kind of
swirling layers of muscles in there so
it can be really really hard to study
and they all kind of look very similar
especially if you've ever looked at a
cadaver which is basically like beef
jerky
so it can be very very difficult to
identify
but what we find is that they all have a
lot in common so let's take a look on
here right so first off
you see the first four all originate on
the medial epicondyle
and then they have somewhat unique
insertion points the flexor carpi
radialis is going to be involved in
wrist flexion
and radial deviation palmaris longus is
going to be just involved in wrist
flexion
flexi carpi ulnaris wrist flexion and
ulnar deviation
and then flexor digitorum superficialis
so flexor digitorum like flex your
digits
superficialis superficial is going to be
involved in finger and wrist flexion
right so that's kind of an easy one so a
lot of the ones that say flexor you
should think
flexion right and like flexor digitorum
uh
digits fingers really really easy way to
think about that now we also have down
there you see plus one
flexor digitorum profundus this one's
kind of grouped into this category as
well
although it does not share that same
common origin point
but we clump it in there because it's
very very similar and has very very
similar actions so we see flexor
digitorum profundus is involved in
finger and wrist flexion
so all these generally are going to be
in our wrist or finger flexion kind of
movement groups
and then some of them might be involved
in radial or ulnar deviation
right if we look at the picture
here we have a nice kind of easy way of
graphical way of looking at it
so this is something that we used to do
when i was in like our sports injury
management class we would use our
forearm
and our hand as an example of like where
you can identify some of these
and then on the right we see another
picture and you can see here like on a
much bigger scale
what some of these muscles look like now
you can imagine when you actually see it
on a cadaver
you might not be able to see a lot of
the stuff underneath why because you
have these big flexor muscles
that are sitting there and you have to
actually like peel them away to see a
lot of the other stuff which is kind of
gross but kind of cool at the same time
so here's kind of what it looks like we
can see that most of them are
originating at that medial epicondyle
and we can see their line of pull based
on where they insert
pretty neat all right let's go on to the
next one so here we have our lateral
epicondyler group
we have a number of muscles again and we
can see the first four
all originate at the lateral epicondyle
and they generally have very common
actions so if we go through we see the
extensor carpi ulnaris
wrist extension ulnar deviation so
extensor you think extension
oneeris oma ulnar deviation right so
these names are actually useful they
kind of help give it away
extensor digitorum so you see your
extensor digits you should think extend
the digit
right so it's going to be involved in
wrist and finger extension so
wrist finger extension extensor digiti
minimi
so extensor digit right extension of the
wrist and pinky finger
so this is going to be something that
specifically extends the pinky finger
extensor carpi radialis brevis wrist
extension and radial deviation
and then again we have a couple more
here we got another plus one another
plus one these
do not originate at the lateral
epicondyle but have such similar
actions in similar line of pull they
usually get clumped into this group as
well
so we see extensor carpi radialis longus
which is involved in wrist extension and
radial deviation
and extensor indices which is the
extension of the index finger and a
little bit of the wrist as well
so these can be kind of lengthy and
within the names and sometimes confusing
but most of the names help kind of give
away what they actually do right so if
it's a flexor
it usually does finger and or wrist
flexion if it's an extensor it does
wrist and or finger extension
if it says radialis it usually moves
towards radial deviation if it says
ulnaris usually moves to ulnar deviation
right something along those lines
so here's another group an image of it
so on the left we see kind of like what
it would look like
from the top like a very superficial
image and then on the right
we actually have a much deeper image if
we peeled a lot of that muscle away
so we could see some of the deeper
muscles of the forearm and we can
actually see some of the other ones that
we talked about like supinator
and brachioradialis from that previous
discussion okay
so those are kind of the big ones now
just keep in mind that's not an
all-inclusive list any of you who have
studied anatomy and physiology before
would know that yeah there's a lot more
to it than just that
but that's kind of the meat and potatoes
that we want you to be aware of
going forward so we can talk about
movement more effectively there are
certainly more things we can discuss but
this is kind of like the nuts and bolts
that we want to hit on
so now for looking at the elbow wrist
and hand and we're trying to describe
movement we generally don't describe the
finite kind of given movements of things
like
gripping onto something or holding onto
something so
usually when we're describing sport or
exercise movements we kind of assume
things like finger and or wrist flexion
if we're gripping onto something
so usually when we're actually
describing sporting our exercise
movements
we're really talking kind of primarily
about the elbow that's usually the
landmark of choice that we're looking at
there are some specific examples of
exercises and sporting movements
where we're actually doing very direct
either wrist extension reflection or
finger extension reflection
but for kind of our gross movements like
throwing a ball
or hitting something with a tennis
racket right we kind of assume
some of those finite movements are
already going on and we don't
necessarily need to describe that as
kind of a predetermined assumption right
now again we can do that but for the
most part we won't so let's take a look
at some examples
so here we have overhead tricep
extension sometimes called freedom press
if you get this wrong you are in a bad
shape really really bad shape why
because the name gives a lot of things
away okay so
what are the correct movement terms
first off tricep extension
right so we're going to see elbow
extension overhead right so we're going
from a flexed position
to an extended position against
resistance right so in this case we
started flexed
we're moving towards extended what are
the agonist
muscles involved the triceps right so
the name of the exercise gave it all
away
don't get it wrong right overhead tricep
extension primary muscle
tricep primary movement extension of the
elbow right
so if we want to be really specific now
how do we actually accurately describe
the downward phase of the movement think
about it
so what are we doing when we're going
from the weight above our head
to the weight behind the head well we're
actively or passively doing elbow
flexion right so we're actually flexing
at the elbow we're decreasing the joint
angle
does that mean that we are actively
engaging our elbow flexors to lower the
movement
no they do provide a role in stabilizing
the movement
but here we're actually seeing an
eccentric muscle action
of the triceps on the downward movement
this is something that a lot of people
tend to get wrong
so although the elbow is flexing the
primary agonist muscles are going to be
the triceps both on the upward and
downward face
make sense all right let's look at
another one
twist curl another example that i like
so in this case we're starting with our
wrists probably in a somewhat of a
neutral position and then we're going to
curl up and turn it up to palms up right
so what are the correct movement terms
here in our twist curl example
well we have some elbow flexion so in
this case instead of
going from flex to extended we're
actually starting extended and moving to
flex right so that's elbow flexion
and in this case we're actually turning
our palms up as we go
so that's going to be supination right
so hopefully nothing too crazy there so
what are the muscle groups involved in
that movement well we're going to see
our biceps brachii our brachialis
brachioradialis
and supinator right all the muscles that
are involved in elbow flexion and or
supination
makes sense so far nothing too crazy
there right
all right another one wrist curls so in
this case we're holding a barbell or a
dumbbell or some type of implement
and we're trying to pull it up and
really work on those forearm muscles
right
so what's the correct movement term well
we're actually trying to pull our palms
up towards our anterior portion of our
forearms
so that'll be a wrist flexion exercise
what are the agonist muscles
essentially pick any from that medial
epicondyler group right
so we know there's a whole bunch we can
choose from any of the ones on that list
that does wrist flexion
are going to be primarily involved right
so no brainer there anything for wrist
flexion
boom that's going to be some of our
primary muscles let's take a look at a
goofy
example one of my favorite sporting
moves ever the shore you can
popularized from street fighter right so
what are we actually seeing in this one
well if we look at the picture
we have ken here he's on fire and his
elbow is starting in a flexed position
and he's actually moving all the way up
into the shoulder you can right
so what are the correct movement terms
when we're looking at the elbow and
wrist
well what we're seeing is we're going
from a flexed position
to an extended position right so that's
going to be elbow extension
and then looks like he's cocking his
fist a little bit and that might just be
for dramatic effect in the picture
so it looks like he's doing some finger
flexion and maybe a little bit of a
wrist flexion
to actually his hand so we're going
to see elbow extension
and then a little bit of finger and
wrist flexion possibly
so what are the agonist muscles involved
probably our triceps brachii for sure to
do that elbow extension
and then any of our wrist and finger
flexors maybe even the supinator
depending on how he started his position
it looks like he's starting here and
then kind of turning
up so he's doing a little bit of a
supination maybe who knows
something along those lines but if we
were to look at the elbow and wrist
that's primarily what's going on makes
sense
all right guys so i hope we have a
pretty good idea of how it describes
some of our upper extremity movements so
far
we're going to keep breaking down all of
our different major muscle regions and
different joints
and keep learning how to describe this
movement appropriately alright
rp plus rpu i'm out i will see you
next time
