all right welcome everyone to a new
episode of the full body science applied
series
in this video we're going to be hitting
the fourth full body workout of the week
and it's going to be a leg focused
session so even though we're hitting the
full body we're going to be doing a bit
more volume for the legs
and like i've been saying before all
these videos if this setup doesn't make
any sense to you i'd recommend checking
out my science explained video on high
frequency full body training first
all right so we're kicking things off
with three sets of five reps on the
reset deadlift with 75
of our one rep max now the reset
deadlift can mean different things to
different coaches
some folks use it to mean you fully
reset each rep meaning you take your
hands off the bar
stand up brace and lift again on each
and every rep
and i think this approach is great for
people who struggle with getting into
position
on that first rep or struggle with their
deadlift setup in general which i've
covered in depth in a technique tuesday
video which i'll link down below
so if you find the first rep more
challenging than the second or third
reps
doing a full reset like this could be
helpful on the other hand i personally
tend to use the reset deadlift simply to
mean that the bar comes to a full and
complete stop in between each and every
rep
it's very common to see recreational gym
goers and bodybuilders do touch and go
or
bounce and go reps which certainly can
have their place but from a strength
perspective i do see them as a way of
cheating
since you're using the momentum of the
plates bouncing off the ground to help
carry the weight up so the far majority
of the time the plates should be coming
to a full and complete
reset on the floor in between each and
every rep now i should say even though
deadlifts sometimes get a bad rap as an
inferior hypertrophy exercise i
personally think they're one of the best
exercises out there for beefing up the
entire posterior chain
from the traps all the way down to the
hamstrings and for testing full body
brute strength so in my opinion it'd be
almost disrespectful to write a full
body program
without having a deadlift in it assuming
you can do it safely so when it comes to
conventional versus sumo the differences
are actually
very small but on a full body setup i
tend to favor sumo
just because research shows that it is
slightly more quad dominant and slightly
less lower back dominant
meaning we can get a bigger quad
stimulus without creating too much of a
lower back recovery demand
which is something i've been
particularly cautious about throughout
this series
with that said the hypertrophic
differences between sumo and
conventional
are pretty small so i think the best
advice is to simply pick a stance that
you're stronger with
now according to an in-house analysis of
the 2018 and 2019
world powerlifting championships from
the strength athlete coaching team
you can see that which stance a lifter
is stronger with is tightly correlated
with their body size
where lighter lifters tend to favor the
sumo stands and heavier lifters tend to
favor the conventional stance
at least this trend is apparent in men
in women it isn't quite as clear
now i contacted the head coach bryce
lewis about this and he said it's
probably because
weight classes are just height classes
in disguise it seems to be the case that
shorter lifters get more out of pulling
sumo perhaps because of their shorter
femur lengths and more vertical
back positioning either way i'd say the
best way to figure out what stance to
use
is to just be your own scientist play
around with both and see which one
you're personally better at
periodically switching back and forth
could have merit as well for developing
weak points
so occasionally switching it up isn't a
bad idea either now one thing i want to
focus on here is the use of the lats in
the deadlift
which is something a lot of people seem
to struggle with many people seem to be
under the impression that the lats play
a big role in keeping the upper back
from rounding in the deadlift
but as pointed out in this article from
greg knuckles the lats don't even attach
to the upper thoracic vertebrae at all
so they can't be responsible for keeping
the upper back extended what they
instead do is keep the bar in closer
which then indirectly makes the lift
easier on your glutes hamstrings and
upper back
because it creates less distance between
the load and the joint
meaning less external torque that your
muscles need to overcome now this isn't
something to overthink but it certainly
can make a significant difference
especially if you've never thought about
it before
so i personally like to queue for lat
engagement by thinking about pulling the
bar in toward my shins
almost as if doing a pullover against
the bar and if you can't figure out what
this should feel like i'll link this
queuing video from dean's somerset below
which illustrates exactly what the lats
should be doing in the deadlift
now in terms of progression here we're
alternating between odd weeks and even
weeks
where we'll switch between doing sets of
five and sets of two
with a simple linear load increase from
week to week for each rep scheme
so the sets of five are going to be
great for accumulating volume and
mastering technique
while the heavy twos are going to
develop maximum strength mostly through
neural adaptation
all right after that we're moving on to
three sets of eight reps on the weighted
dip
now dips are one of those exercises that
can get a bad rap for being rough on the
shoulders
but in my opinion are one of the single
best chest builders out there now when
it comes to shoulder health the main
things i like to focus on are making
sure you're keeping your upper back
straight by keeping your shoulder blades
retracted and depressed
just like you would on a bench press and
you want to limit your range of motion
to what feels comfortable for you
for most people going to about a 90
degree elbow bend is going to be plenty
to get the chest
delts and triceps all heavily involved
without over committing the joints
now when it comes to building the chest
many people think of the dip as a
strictly
lower chest exercise but in 2010 brett
contreras ran a solo emg experiment
which found that the dip actually saw
higher peak activation for the upper
chest than even the incline press with
225 pounds
so even though the lower chest was most
active when compared to the mid and
upper chest on the dip
itself that doesn't imply that the dip
is only a lower chest exercise
it actually hits all the fibers of the
entire pec extremely effectively
and i think you can accentuate this even
more by leaning slightly forward by
about 30 degrees or so
and really driving your hands down into
the handles as if doing a press
while maintaining consistent posture
throughout the range of motion
okay after that we're moving on to three
sets of 20 on the leg extension
and you guys should remember from day
one that i like to space out my leg
exercises on these full body days with
at least
one upper body exercise just so they
feel a bit more recovered from the
deadlifts or squats that we hit before
so what i've been trying on these lately
is a new cue where before i initiate
that first rep
i think about keeping my glutes
hamstrings and calves as loose as
possible
while thinking about flexing my quads as
hard as i can
before initiating the rep so i'll think
about squeezing my quads to move the
weight rather than just kicking the
weight out in front of me and then even
on the negative i'm thinking about
flexing my quads as the weight lowers
under control that's a subtle difference
but i do find i can get much more out of
the exercise
this way than if i just think about okay
we got three sets of 20 let's just bang
them out
and you'll likely find that when you
actively squeeze and flex your quads on
each and every rep
you might feel so much of a quad burn
that you need to stop a bit shorter of
where you'd normally stop with the same
weight
which i think is fine with exercises
like these we want to focus on creating
as strong of a mind muscle connection as
possible
to help produce a large tensile stimulus
without the same need to load as heavily
and we know from research
that combining various exercises is
better for overall quad development than
simply
just doing squats on their own and i
think one of the advantages of high
frequency full body training
is being able to give these isolation
exercises like leg extensions
more attention and focus since they
aren't coming at the end of a really
brutal leg day
all right after that we're moving on to
three sets of 12 on each side with a
unilateral lat
pull down now one thing i see with most
full body programs is that they tend to
focus very heavily on compound exercises
and as a result become quite
minimalistic in their approach now this
isn't necessarily a bad thing especially
if you're trying to minimize your time
investment in the gym
but these minimalistic setups might not
offer enough loading variety and as a
result might over tax the same joints in
the same way
especially on a high frequency setup so
i like to include some unilateral work
to prevent doing the same exact loading
patterns that you tend to see over and
over
with the same basic barbell compound
movements and this is also another great
way to develop a mind muscle connection
with your non-dominant side
since most people tend to favor one side
over the other on bilateral exercises
which can lead to asymmetrical
development over time
so when it comes to the pull down i'm
doing these as a combination of shoulder
extension
and adduction by thinking about pulling
my elbows both down
and in so i'm not just driving my elbows
down like in a pullover
and i'm not just pulling my elbows in
like in a wide grip row
i'm doing both at the same time to cover
both primary functions of the lat
in a single move all right now after
that we're going to finish off the rest
of the workout with a giant
superset with the rope face pull
egyptian lateral raise
and cable overhead tricep extension for
three sets of 15 reps each
so up first the rope face pull now there
are two ways that you can set this up
one way is more mid trap dominant and
the other more rear delt and rotator
cuff dominant with the trap dominant
option
you want to think about just doing it
exactly like a high row so driving your
elbows straight back and squeezing your
shoulder blades together
now with the rear delt dominant option
you want to think about externally
rotating at the shoulder and i like to
think of it like doing a rear double
biceps pose
while pulling the rope up to your
forehead so because there's already a
lot of rowing in this routine
i'm doing the rear delt focused version
here to help strengthen up the external
rotators and give the rear delts a
little more love so after that drop the
cable down a few pegs
leave the rope on and do 15 overhead
tricep extensions now you can do these
unilaterally by just grabbing the end of
the cable itself
but if you want to cut down on time a
bit since it is a giant set after all
you can easily just knock out both arms
at once with the rope
and here because the cable provides a
more consistent tension curve than a
dumbbell or a barbell would
i do allow my triceps to go a little
further back to get a little extra
stretch at the bottom
and then focus on squeezing my triceps
to move the weight
all the way up to full elbow extension
and to finish off the giant set we're
going to drop the cables all the way
down
put a d handle on and run the cable
between our legs for egyptian lateral
raises
and while on a dumbbell lateral raise
i'll normally cut the range of motion a
bit short at the bottom where there
won't be any active tension on the delts
when doing these with cables i'll allow
the cable to go down in between my legs
to get a solid stretch on my delts
since the cable will be pulling against
the delt at all time points throughout
the range of motion
and that's gonna be a wrap for this
workout guys so i've got one more delt
focused full body workout to go to
complete the full series and then at the
end
i'll do a full tally of all the volumes
for each body part so you guys can stay
tuned for that
also i'll put a button over here to my
high frequency full body program
that runs for 10 weeks and if you guys
would like to have all this stuff
organized into an actionable routine
with all the relevant periodization and
progression included and you can check
that out
don't forget to leave me a thumbs up if
you enjoyed the video subscribe if you
haven't already and i'll see you guys
all here
in the next one
