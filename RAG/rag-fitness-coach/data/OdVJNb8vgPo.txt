welcome back to
the second to last episode in this
series
in today's video i am two weeks out and
i want to discuss a few things
first up
i want to discuss my thoughts at one
week out from my show
secondly i want to discuss the peak week
timeline and what my plans are
for this peak week
and finally i wanted to discuss my
long-term bodybuilding aspirations
so as of this recording i am now eight
days out or seven days out i don't
really count the last day because um
the last day is just traveling and
competing itself and stuff like that
so i'm basically a week out now
and
yeah this is going to be the second to
last video in the series
first up my thoughts at one week out
so
one week out
it feels like i've been dieting forever
in part because i have um
i've spent
basically since the beginning of 2021
somewhat preparing for this show
i've spent maybe
six out of the last 10 months dieting in
some form
and then the rest has been spent either
at maintenance or in mass
i've lost around 40 pounds total so from
around 240 pounds to around 200 pounds
now
in fact this morning i had my first
weigh-in
in over four years below 200 pounds or
90 kilograms for us european folk
and
it's taken a toll
it's been 10 months of
obviously smart training as well i've
taken some deal weeks i've taken some
maintenance phases and so forth
but spending 10 months with a singular
goal of getting leaner and leaner and
leaner and as lean as i've ever been
has been
hard
i am
grateful that i only have one week left
at this point
to be frank the first
six to eight months of this whole prep
were pretty easy
um
again living at
8 to 20 body fat is pretty comfortable
and so even cutting down to
around
95 kilograms or 210 pounds was pretty
comfortable
but the last few months have really
taken it out of me and so i am
glad this prep is reaching its end
um
i am
experiencing a lot of
overreaching symptoms and diet fatigue
symptoms and
prep fatigue symptoms all at once
as far as training overreaching symptoms
go i'm starting to become very anxious
about each session
like every single session
feels
like
an obstacle
and
at times insurmountable and i get very
anxious and nervous before each session
even like a day before i start getting
nervous
if i think think too far ahead i get
nervous as well
i my whole body aches to some extent
like most of my joints have some sort of
slight pain or ache associated with them
not any like serious injury that
wouldn't just fade away with some
calories and some rest
but just overall feeling quite rough
then
diet fatigue wise
i just feel
basically permanently hungry
like there's a few moments where i feel
satiated or anything close to satiation
it's a weird thing where even when i am
quite full like my stomach is full
i will still feel that sensation of
hunger and wanting to eat more
then as far as prep fatigue goes which
is sort of the same as diet fatigue in
some sense
i
am really not enjoying doing my steps
anymore each day i am
extremely food focused as i've mentioned
in the last episode it's gotten to a
point where
i mostly just think about food or
training or meat or posing or what have
you
and the food focus in particular has
been quite debilitating
when i try and go to bed for example
food is most of what i think about i
dream about food i think about food all
the time
um i haven't reached the stage where for
example i'd feel guilt or
anxiety regarding food but mostly i just
think about food all the time like it's
something i guess sort of like a
rumination wherein you don't really stop
thinking about it
and that's been
quite rough it's the first time i've
really experienced anything of this
magnitude
um
and i'm looking forward to being over
at this point though i am one week out
from my show i've got three days of hard
dieting left
five days of hard training or six
sessions total
and
seven days of prep as a whole
and so
at this point i'm taking it as i said
one session at a time
one small battle at a time um
my day can sort of be separated into a
few battles i have to win every day to
optimize everything
one is doing my steps so i do at least
15 000 steps a day
a second one would be getting my
training sessions in so that's usually
one or two training sessions unless the
rest day
then
not going over my calories that's the
main goal as far as the prep concern
um and then finally my posing if i can
get all of those in a day it was a good
day
and thus far in the past month or so
i've been extremely consistent with
those
as a whole during this prep i've stayed
maybe
95 or more consistent with training and
over 90 consistent with nutrition as
well especially during the last month or
so
that said though just yesterday i
sustained a small injury i was doing
overhead press which i didn't record in
this video
as we go by press as literally the first
set of my last training week
and my right shoulder blade just sort of
went and strained itself
i
initially my thought process going into
it was
oh [ __ ]
do i now just call it a day and not
train for the rest of the day because
that was my first set of two sessions
that day
and a big part of me was ready to just
give up on the training day and make
adjustments and take it easy
but then i
had to think about it and be a bit more
cool-headed about it for a few minutes
and eventually i decided okay let's keep
going with the session
see what hurts and what doesn't what i
can actually do
with minimal pain and what i can't
and so i wound up skipping one set of
overpressing
but getting through all of the remaining
training for the day
and so overall what initially announced
itself as being quite catastrophic and
dramatic etc
turned out to be something i could work
with and i think this deep into prep
injury should almost be expected and you
need to work with it
injury should always
you should always try to minimize
how big of a thing injury becomes in
your head
you should always try and find ways to
work around it ways to still keep up
with training to an extent even if it
means modifying it and getting that
desired stimulus while still recovering
from that injury
roughly speaking those are my thoughts
about prep at this point i'm looking
forward to being over
i want to quickly discuss the peak week
timeline
so i am it's saturday today uh i'm
competing on sunday in a week
here is how the peak week is gonna
unfold
i'm trading twice on monday am session
pm session am session is upper body pm
sessions lower body
on tuesday i'm training pull essentially
so back shoulders biceps and so forth
wednesday i'm training am pm again i
have
upper body or push in the morning and
then legs into the evening and then
thursday i have one last session which
is
pull again
now
at the same time i have one
pump session in which i'm doing
a few sets of 15 to 30 reps in all body
parts
to maximize glycogen replenishment that
session should build a lot of calories
overall in your body
to maximize glycogen replenishment but
it shouldn't be very damaging because
muscle damage can interfere with
glycogen replenishment and so it's
basically going to be two to four sets
for all body parts of 15 to 30 reps with
exercises i'm accustomed to
because novelty or new exercises can
actually increase muscle damage and so
you want to avoid introducing something
new at that point and then all sets will
be taken to at most an rp5 just again
because taking sets close to failure
typically results more muscle damage
which is not a goal during a pump up
session and so that final pump up
session is going to take place on
saturday around 24 hours before my calm
and yeah as far as training goes that's
it steps are going to be kept at 15 000
every day to make it easier to calculate
maintenance calories and so forth
nutritionally
so 15 000 steps daily until show day
finally nutritionally
up until wednesday so four days out for
my show i'm just cutting like i usually
would
and then on wednesday i'll have a high
calorie day where i increase my calories
to around 110 of a maintenance with
those additional calories coming from
corbs to
fill out quite a bit and sort of see
where i'm at um
look wise
if after that i feel quite spilled over
the following days i drop calories down
to around
eighty percent of my maintenance which
is around a 500 calorie deficit
for thursday and friday so three and two
days out for my show respectively
and finally on saturday i have between
eighty percent and 110 of maintenance
calories depending on how i look so all
throughout this process i'll be
assessing my look
in the am and pm sometimes um to see how
i look and if i look for example very
dry but also small i might add some
carbs in and stick to the top end of
that range on saturday whereas if i feel
quite spilled over and full and not very
detailed i might more so stick to the
bottom end as far as salt and water open
sound i'm not going to manipulate them
very much
on the day of the show itself i'm going
to have some extra sodium because food
volume is a bit lower than usual and
blood pressure is quite low towards the
end of prep and so having a bit of extra
sodium can help make sure you're able to
get a pump
that's basically it for my pq timeline
on
saturday
the day before my comp i'll be traveling
up to birmingham and staying in a hotel
overnight getting my tanning doing my
pump up session relaxing for the evening
going to a better reasonable hour in the
morning get up get my second
tan coat on tan layer whatever
then
get on stage for pre-judging in the am
which is symmetry and muscularity rounds
then eat some food in between the am and
the pm session
and then for my pm session just hit up
the posing routine and then have the
awards
afterwards i'll be going out to
celebrate some food
finally real quick i just wanted to
discuss in brief my bodybuilding
aspirations long term i'll probably make
a full video about this or discuss it
more at length in the next video
but to make a long story short i'm 21
years old
this is my first competition i think
having one competition or so maybe two
in your early 20s makes sense as a coach
and as an athlete
to get a feel for the experience
but then i think a lot of that time in
your early 20s even late 20s even early
30s
should be spent mostly building a lot of
size
and so i'll be spending my
later
well early to late 20s
maybe competing
two to three more times total in
bodybuilding two or three seasons i mean
if i do compete again
but spending the vast majority of that
time
in an off season building more muscle
because i'm quite healthy now and so now
is a good time to build some muscle
moreover
i think waiting until i'm at least 25 to
compete again makes sense
when i'm 25 i'll make a decision of
whether or not i want to try pds
now
trying pds does not entail staying on
them forever it doesn't entail using
much of them
it just means i will consider taking
them and seeing how i respond
if i respond well in terms of what i get
out of it if i think it's a good choice
as far as my competitive potential goes
um if i respond to one sort of side
effects i'll consider dipping my toes in
a bit further but it'll always be a very
methodical approach and very
um calculated so to speak
but so my plan is to spend from now
after my show until i'm around 25 in an
offseason
and when i'm around 25 i'll either plan
to compete against natural bodybuilding
or potentially
begin using pd's see what i get out of
it high respond etc and then if i go on
pd's
probably do an off season for a few more
years to take advantage of the pds
whereas if i stay natural and i want to
compete again that's what i'll compete
in brief those are my bodybuilding plans
for the next 10 years or so 5-10 years
those might change obviously over time
but that's the long short of it
anyways that wraps up this video
i am
very excited to get this prep over with
