hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance precision
rpu
rp plus you know what i'm here for the
world really if i think about it
before we try to save the world however
let's make sure we get our ducks in a
row with advanced hypertrophy concepts
specifically number four range of motion
in
training for muscle growth
here we go let's take a look at the
contents first up
is what is a conservative range of
motion and training let's go talk about
exactly what is up for grabs and what
we're going to be discussing
why do we care number two as you've
probably become accustomed to in the
series is defining range of motion
always have to define our terms so we
know exactly what is being discussed
probably 50 percent of discussions or
debates online
um are very erroneous because they don't
come to a consensus on the definitions
and then they spend
a lot of time going around in circles i
have to get our definition straight what
is range of motion and it's a pretty
complex definition it turns out
and then there are four specific goals
we want to achieve with range of motion
uh and we'll go through those and we'll
detail them now but you can see them on
your screen
and then we're going to talk about a
very very um closely related concept
that
if we didn't cover it wouldn't be really
doing range of motion due diligence it's
exercise variation of force curve
matching
and of course then programming
recommendations and summary
implications so why do we care about
range of motion
in training um while it's to answer an
interesting question an example of which
is like when you know when you're doing
leg press for bigger quads how deep do
you go
what is it can you imagine imagine
asking someone that why are you going
that deep and not deeper or not
shallower
imagine asking yourself that what is
exactly the answer to that now
um i don't think the answer is
immediately obvious i think it requires
some thought
um why well you could say like we're
trying to activate the quads well the
quads are generally active at any range
of motion even isometrically we can just
put
a thousand pounds on the leg press
almost lock out with it
and press into the thousand pounds it
doesn't move and you activate the quads
to a significant extent and
uh electromyographical data will show
that your quads are very very active
so they certainly get activation there's
certainly a force transduction or
throughput
which is the number one cause of
hypertrophy anyway so all of a sudden
we're left wondering why we move weight
at all or we just isometrically contract
and if we start to describe why do we go
through a range of motion
uh the next question is which range of
motion is a good idea
and uh you know it's it's totally
possible to say you know full rom
is a good idea but a lot of times people
say that and we'll get to this in a bit
now sort of dogmatically right they'll
say well full rom you gotta do full rom
you say why and they're like because
because otherwise you're like you're
like bitching out like yes i understand
full rock could be more challenging
we're not actually in the gym to
challenge ourselves what is what are we
in the gym to do we're in the gym to
grow muscle okay
that can be challenging as a secondary
factor but that's not
the the mission that's not the whole
point much more challenging thing to do
in the gym is literally just repeatedly
run into a wall face first without
putting your hands up that's way harder
than lifting weights that doesn't get
you jacked
maybe you make face jacked after a while
but um
you know just because something is
harder more challenging doesn't mean we
need to bully each other into doing it
we need to do it for a good reason and
the only good reason is muscle growth
right um and it turns out that if we
sort of
really examine it which is what we're
going to do here there are distinct
benefits and downsides to various ranges
of motion right
and we have to get real specific about
what we're looking at
what are the risks what are the upsides
and figure out which way is a good way
forward
remember when we're discussing this
topic the gold is always
in these advanced hypertrophy lectures
optimal hypertrophy that's goal number
one and probably gold number
everything a secondary goal which just
feeds into that goal so it's really part
of the same goal is safety
right and any one training session any
one rep that you do
uh if it's very unsafe it could be
maximally hypertrophic and the next
possible technique
could be less hypertrophic per rep but
if the risk is
huge with that one rep you did that's
you know producing a lot of growth in
that rep but is very risky for
injury concerns just that doesn't make
sense to train like that all the time
because at some point you're going to
get hurt
when you get hurt you don't grow any
more muscle i'm telling unless you heal
and so the situation really there is we
have to make sure that when we're
searching for the optimal rom for
training which we'll be doing
we want a range of motion that grows a
ton of muscle the most possible
slash is also not completely
ridiculously unsafe or it's actually
close to maximizing safety so
let's get real specific what is
when we say range of motion in the
context of hypertrophy training what do
we mean
okay we really mean is
we're talking about the exercise range
of motion of the exercise
and it's the number of degrees of
angular displacement created all of the
involved joints like
if you move you know your elbow from
here to here that's like i don't know
30 degrees if you move it from here to
here that's like you know 95 or 100
degrees
the more range of motion the more
degrees of
total you know angular displacement
there is if you move your shoulder as
well as your elbow we count
shoulder degrees and elbow degrees and
we add them up right so we can actually
think of range of motion as the sum
total of all joints right you can even
do one of these with the wrist
right so you do wrist elbow shoulder and
then elbow
or shoulder then elbow then wrist we add
all of them up and that's the total
range of motion of the exercise
angular displacement at all joints so
very good technical definition
um so what does full rom mean well
that's when things get a little bit more
mysterious
turns out full ram is impossible to
completely well defined why
uh for some exercises it's super easy to
define full ram on push-ups is super
easy
you go down you hit the ground okay
that's the end of that and then you come
up and you lock out which is physically
impossible to go any further
right but what about for dumbbell curls
what's full round for dumbbell curls
like if you
stop dumbbell curls here okay sweet but
what if you do some shoulder flexion i
mean the biceps is involved in shoulder
flexion
when you go back down how far should you
stretch on the way back if you do an
incline curl you stretch further back
than if you do a standing curl so it's a
standing curly partial range of motion
gee you know that's a really good
question what we're definitely not
addressing here
is uh the muscles full wrong because
some people say well full ram is
bullshit
because the muscles themselves are not
being taken through the full range of
motion of course not most muscles are
designed in such a way
that the physiological range of motion
of the muscle if you take it out of the
body
stretch it to its limits and come back
is way way higher than anything you can
do in the body because it's attached to
a joint that doesn't even maximally
stretch the muscle
that's done for very good reason usually
you maximize force production
because if you stretch a muscle real far
it starts produ producing very little
force
and also to enhance safety like you
don't want a part of your body that can
be stretched so much it pops off
uh bad deal i'll tell you what muscles
that experience high injury rates often
are more designed like that the
hamstrings for example can be stretched
well if you use enough weight in a stiff
legged deadlift
uh can be stretched beyond their
physiological range and then they get
super fucking injured and that's really
really bad so we're not talking about
range of motion of the muscle
we're talking about exercise range of
motion so
um when we talk about full rom
we can usually talk about fuller and
less full rom
and we're not religiously and
dogmatically saying like if
it's a full rom or not we're going to be
talking about more range of motion
less range of motion and uh trying to
figure out which one is better what are
the costs what are the downsides well
which one is
is uh worse and we want to basically get
to a set of sort of dependable
principles
when we come to a new exercise we say
what should the range of motion
be here uh we want to come to a set of
dependable principles that guides us
to very quickly selecting the range of
motion that's probably a really good
idea to do
staying away from ranges of motion that
for a combination of reasons might not
be best
what are the reasons we got four of them
here's reason number one
one of the goals of range of motion is
motor unit stimulation okay we stimulate
motor units
those are groups of muscle fibers
with one nerve attached to them the
nerve tells them to turn on and they
turn on as a group
they're located all throughout the
muscle and when they're active
they produce tension and they experience
metabolite increases and that's how
growth happens
right so we have a whole bunch of motor
units all through our muscles
and the more of them we activate and the
more of them we stress
the more we grow right turns out
however that not all motor units are
active in all portions of the total
muscle rom
so like for example if your biceps or
quads
you know down here from here to here
some motor units might be completely
turned off
uh from here to here some motor units
might be completely turned off and from
here to here some of them may be
completely turned off
so if you only ever do curls like this
you're legit uh risking just never
turning on some motor units and thus
having a fraction of your muscle never
experience hypertrophy
not the greatest thing in the world now
sometimes
motor units turn on in partial ranges of
motion but not maximally
and only through very maximal high rate
coding activity the nervous system
really pushing them
do motor units experience most of the
hypertrophy so sometimes
if you curl from this range to this
range some motor units might turn on at
various parts of that
but they contribute very little force
and they're never really turned on to a
really really high degree
that's not great because we want them to
turn on to as high degrees possible to
experience maximal hypertrophy
right another thing
is sometimes there's parts of a range of
motion during which motor units turn on
and then parts during which they're not
on at all so in a curl for example
hypothetically
there's you know from this range of
motion to this range of motion
you know during half of the first half
some motor units are really active in
the second half they're really sort of
not very active or not active at all
which means that when you are reaching
concentric failure due to the limiting
factor motor units that are on
all of the time the motor units are just
on some of the time they never get
pushed very close to failure
and that's where most gains happen or
the vast majority of them anyway
and thus those motor units either you
could say they're active but they're not
active through enough of the range of
motion to become limiting factors to the
motion
to get close to their maximum abilities
to contract to really experience high
elevations of internal metabolite
uh flux like calcium and all this other
stuff that probably causes muscle growth
directly to occur
so basically the lack of better term
they're not pushed enough to their
limits and then they grow don't grow
much so that's definitely a problem
however a lot of these are pretty
solvable problems because the more of a
muscle's total
range of motion you engage the larger
the volume of muscle you stimulate to
grow
if you curl from here to here there's
some stuff you're missing right it's
probably like not a ton of stuff but it
adds up over time however if you curl as
much as you can the higher the range of
motion you curl or do any other exercise
or any other muscle
the more of those uh motor units you
stimulate the more of them you stimulate
actively and the more of them stimulate
for the longest time
turning them into motor units that
experience a great deal of local fatigue
and thus very likely experience
hypertrophy as well right
so because of this barring any other
factors we
can consider and we will consider uh
extended range of motion training is
just plain old better than limited range
of motion training or just just on that
on that face value first so goal number
one
uh more range of motion is better if for
at least this reason
okay so that means that if you're given
the choice to
pick an exercise that's optimal or close
which is stupid because you got a bunch
of choices anyway you can do variation
you know what probably grows more muscle
regular bench press where the bar stops
at your chest or a cambered bar bench
where you can go deeper probably the
camera bar bench
camera bar rows probably a little bit
quote unquote better
than the regular barbell row and the
deficit deadlift is hypothetically
better for the people that are flexible
enough to do it
than a regular deadlift for hypertrophy
purposes right in most cases
but we at least have a reason to believe
that could be the case
all right goal number two
so it's not just the motor unit
stimulation we're going for it turns out
safety is a really big concern on the
plus side
of higher ranges of motion in order
to get the same intramuscular forces
you actually have to use less external
weight for example
if you use a squat and you squat halfway
down and halfway or halfway down and up
right you might have to throw like 400
pounds on your back
and the force through the muscle is
going to be some amount
very high if you go to 300 pounds
and you squat all the way down and all
the way up the leverages that your
muscles are put under
squatting especially past parallel and
back up
are really disadvantageous your muscle
has to pull
super mega hard in order to get your
dumb ass
out of the squat hole with 300 pounds
and it turns out
that if you go close to failure and if
you equate roughly the same reps
so whatever your set of eight was for
400 pounds however much
you know let's say 300 pounds is your
set of eight to depth versus a set of
eight
halfway with 400 you actually end up
having pretty similar peak forces
uh that you expose the muscles to
because of the fact that the muscles are
greatly disadvantaged there's a lot of
people
on the one hand people say i can do
partial range of motion because i can
lift more weight
but like do you feel like it's just is
more challenging to the muscles
themselves and they're like yeah they're
like
why don't you try going deeper and
they're like no no wait that's hard
you're like
isn't hard a good thing here like oh i
guess it is
right so as far as the muscles are
concerned the force is basically very
similar
uh if you do full range of motion with
lighter weight or more range of motion
with lighter weight
uh go through going through those very
difficult sticking points then if you
more or less avoid the sticking points
and do a partial range of motion that
makes
the lift sort of easier so you have to
use more weight now notice i'm saying
that the forces presented are very
similar
so what's the advantage of full range of
motion well here's the deal
what's the injury risk of going through
a more full range of motion with 300
pounds in a squat
versus a partial with 400 which hit this
anytime you handle big weights
your chance of injury goes up but
anytime you do full ranges of motion or
fuller range of motion as long as you're
used to them and you've eased into them
that's not really a big chance of injury
right there's not
an observation in sports uh statistics
for injury like
when people go through four-inch motion
they're more likely to get hurt that's
just not a thing
when people use higher loads they're
always more likely to get hurt
you can take an extreme example just to
illustrate the point
if you have to squat with 400 pounds for
all the way down squats it sucks right
you could get hurt
but if you're really strong strong
enough to do 400 for tens
400 pounds is never really enough force
to like really mess with your tendons or
if you're off a little bit one way or
another you have to like raise one foot
lift one foot
um g you know 400 can definitely get you
hurt but it's
a little bit controllable same person
that just sets a 10 to 400 if they did
half squats
would have to do like 585 like six
plates on a side 585
you zig when you're supposed to zag and
you're done
you're loading through the spine way
more weight
which increases the chance of spinal
injury like crazy like still a low
total risk but it might be double or
triple the risk
so you're exposing your body to
objectively heavier weights
you're increasing your risk and the
question is for what purpose well we
said
the transduction of force through the
muscle is very similar
what the hell are we doing like are we
just trying to get our joints strong if
that's the case sure partial lifting is
not a terrible idea
that we're trying to go for muscular
hypertrophy the fuller range of motion
gives us the same results
from a force perspective for the muscles
which is generating tension and is a big
factor of hypertrophy
with much less weight making it safer to
get the same thing
in addition to that per motor unit
forces which is a really big concern as
well because that's what really grows
muscle
are the same same idea applies higher
range of motion requires less external
load
so higher range of motion can get us the
same hypertrophy on a load basis
with much less risk for injury which is
a really really good thing
on the other hand if we take range of
motion
too far and we extend the range of
motion considerably
what do we end up with well if you do
excessive
excessive ranges of motion you can
actually endanger muscle and connective
tissue via stretch
for example let's say you can do stuff
like a vet lifts a 225
and you're so flexible that you can
touch the barbell to the ground every
time and it's that nice painful deep
hamstring stretch that you love
awesome what if we put you on a six
inch platform and told you to touch the
ground with 225
and as a matter of fact you said oh i
can't let's put 275 on the bar you can
do that with touching the ground for
sets of four
try doing a set of four but touch all
the way down 275 pounds
set a four all the way down you're going
to jack your shit up sorry
a lack of technical terminology here
extreme stretch out of
on a muscle with a weight heavy enough
to cause hypertrophy
increases injury risk if that stress is
so far beyond the muscle's normal
capacity
then there's just no more way to stretch
basically
muscles have passive and active
stretching elements once you've
stretched the active part of the muscle
and once you've stretched the passive as
long as it goes any more stretch
is literally going to deform tissue and
not in a way that is
uh elastic deformation doesn't just come
back it's what's called plastic
deformation which just goes
and then when you leave it alone that's
it right and then your body can heal
that but that is
formally an injury right and and that's
how it's so
you if you go way too range of motion
way too far range of motion
you can absolutely increase injury risk
right in some exercises this is
basically impossible
like in a barbell bench press where
you're going to go nowhere right but
you can absolutely go deep enough on a
deficit push-up stuff like a deadlift
and a couple of other exercises
is that you can absolutely increase your
risk so more rom isn't necessarily safer
a high degree of range of motion is but
there is such a thing as excessive rom
for the connective tissue and the muscle
itself but there's another problem
very related even if the connective
tissue is good even if the muscle is
good right so basically we're talking
about the muscle
and the two tendons or the several
tendons that attach it to whatever
joints
uh or whatever bones they they connect
to that might be okay
but the joints moving themselves might
have limitations
right so if you move your shoulder to
here right is it a good idea to move it
here and then here and then all the way
up here
gee with weight maybe not and joints
distinctly have safe ranges of motion
and have relatively unsafe ranges of
motion now
most joints you're physically unable to
move them any further than what a safe
for example the elbow
it's either locked out and there's no
elbow range of motion where it's too
much
right the bicep stops it or it's locked
out right the shoulders
not the case the spine not the case
right so if you want to do a leg press
and you can't you know touch the bottom
of the leg press if you round your back
like crazy
yes your back is capable of rounding but
under those loads
none of the spinal joints are safe and
all of a sudden you're going to herniate
your
discs and you're going to be like oh man
like i guess that was too much ramen
you'd be absolutely correct
right so do we have any recommendations
from here
not yet we need a little bit more
information okay so so
far we've got range of motion is usually
good when it's better or sorry
usually better when there's more of it
but there's definitely such a thing as
too much
point number three goal number three of
uh range of motion
stretch under tension so it's been shown
that stretch under tension
is very likely an independent stimulator
of hypertrophy
which is really cool that means there's
something about stretch under tension
that grows muscle
different than just providing tension or
different than just stretching without
tension sweet
we want to make sure we get that
hypertrophy maybe not all the time but
certainly in
some exercises some points during our
training cycle whether it be week month
or year we want to expose ourselves to
stretch and retention so
a deep stretch possibly even an
uncomfortably deep stretch so long as
the joints are okay so long as the
connective tissues are okay and the
muscle is okay might be of benefit in
exercises where it's possible
so for example on a dumbbell bench press
like you want to stretch your pecs to
where you're like oh okay
i feel you pax um stiff legged deadlifts
for the hamstrings are like a really
good stretch is a good idea
pull ups full range of motion on the
lats stretch the the lats at the bottom
very very good thing because stretch
under tension is a positive so all of a
sudden
we have a bit of an objective kind of
goal to where we can say okay there's
there
for sure something called too much range
of motion is unsafe
but until and unless we feel a stretch
usually we can keep going with range of
motion so now we have more of an
objective rather than just
more is better uh we have something like
okay if we're feeling a good deal of
stretch under tension
there's probably not much more to get
from that range of motion because
after you feel stretch under tension
anything more range of motion than that
is going to start to be incrementally
more painful stretch and that's probably
going to run into joint problems
or connective tissue or muscular
problems
now last goal of range of motion is
an interesting one consistency
it's not a direct goal but it actually
works really really well so
imagine doing something led by some
curls and you just sort of like you're
not doing full range of motion
you're kind of curling like this some of
the curls come up to here and go
like all the way down but sometimes the
curls are just here like it can vary rep
to rap set to set whatever like if
if you're moving up a week to week over
the the course of a mesocycle
and the weights get heavier like you
used to lock out all the way but you're
like damn fuck that like i'll actually
get these reps like i have a set of
eight i gotta get eight
so like as you get tired your reps get a
little bit shallower right so what's the
problem there right
first problem if you always do slightly
different range of motion how do you
know you're getting stronger
right the quintessential element of
tracking for hypertrophy program is
mesocycle over mesocycle over mesocycle
and especially block to block to block
are you getting stronger four reps in
the rep ranges you train if you're not
you're almost certainly not growing any
muscle if you are
whatever else is going on you're
probably growing muscle and you're doing
super well
if you always alter your rom how do you
know if you're getting stronger
it's funny because like every now and
again i lifted gyms people asked me for
a spot and when i was a professor i
listed university gyms in which the
fuckery is super high
and someone asked for a spot and uh you
know
they'll say like oh yeah like you're
gonna bench 250 and i'm like how many
you want they're like four
i'm like sweet and then like they do
like three bullshit half reps by
themselves and they ask me to help on
the last one
and then like usually they'll do four
and they'll ask for like one more like
okay we're doing five together and i'm
up right rowing 185 pounds for you
which i usually don't do i just rack for
them after that kind of effort
what is that person's perception like is
is 250 pounds for five
whatever quote-unquote five is that a pr
are they doing better
well who knows what was the range of
motion when the last time they did 250
or when they did 240.
uh they have no idea because they
weren't tracking it because they weren't
standardizing it was
it was a potentially almost certainly
different range of motion
very difficult to track progress if it
was different right
um another and and to that point uh
probably a worse concern
is how do you know if you're hitting
maximum recovery volume or not maximum
recovery volume is detected
by a drop off a consistent drop-off in
performance uh within
two two consecutive sessions where you
know you're underperforming
hypothetically uh during a time in your
motorcycle when volume is really high
and you can usually pin that on you've
just exceeded your ability to recover
because you're doing too much volume the
thing is how do we know how we're
performing well we count reps and we
can't wait
last week i did 405 in the squat first
out of 10. this week i did 410 for a set
of six
and then later in the week i did 410 for
a set of five like
clearly i'm under recovers is four or
five for ten does not match those other
numbers by a long shot
the thing is if you cut your reps when
you feel tired when you're getting close
to your mrv you just cut your reps
shorter
uh and then all of a sudden you're still
quote-unquote performing at the same
level so if you don't have a
standardization based on one single kind
of rom
you have no idea if you're hitting mrv
which can mean that literally you can
train
for weeks after you've hit your mrv
which is a really bad idea from injury
perspective
for a muscle growth perspective really
really bad bad
situation um what about
applying overload right you have a
session on monday
and a session next monday of bench press
you did uh four sets with 200 pounds for
sets of 10 let's say just to keep it
simple
uh on last monday this next monday you
want to provide an overload and say like
you got pretty sore last time so you
don't want to increase the number of
sets that would be too much
uh what do you do well you know so four
sets of 200 pounds for sets of 10
you do four sets with 205 for sets of
10. well hold up if you cut your reps a
little bit with 205
uh maybe you actually did more total
work
because the range of motion was higher
for 200 your overload
for 200 and plus you missed out on some
stretch under tension for this this one
that you're cutting the reps
yes you're using more weight for the
same reps and the same sets
but you're actually not providing an
overload because you're doing physically
less mechanical work
and you're skipping the part that's most
hypertrophic or very hypertrophic by
itself
so all of a sudden you're not providing
overload and as a matter of fact if you
alter your range of motion a ton you
cannot be sure that in any one session
you're providing overland
you can be more sure if you had a bunch
of sets but listen if you cut your reps
by half you can add
go from four sets to eight sets if you
cut your reps by half
as far as rep range is concerned you're
still not providing an oval surprise
just about the same thing right or not
providing an optimal overload so
how do you know if you're providing an
optimal overload how do you know if
you're making things more difficult
when you don't even know how difficult
things are at any one time right a very
very big question and a question that's
unable to you're unable to answer if
you're not consistent with your range of
motion
another one the principle of direct
adaptation which we covered earlier in
this lecture series
means it implies that you need to
retarget the same motor unit pool over
and over and over for multiple
sequential sessions to get the best
possible results
sweet how do you know you'll be
targeting the same pool for direct
adaptation if you're doing different
ranges of motion
i can actually put this a better way
you're not because if you change random
motion all the time you're actually
targeting slightly different motor unit
pools and you're reducing your direct
adaptation
like yeah one day you do middle of the
range bicep and then one day you do more
full range and so the middle of the
range isn't pushed as
hard as it was and every other you know
the new ranges are pushed like
they have been pushed in a while so now
they're you know they're experiencing a
lot of novelty
a lot of times people alter the range of
motions week to week to week because
they sense the novelty and they get sore
but that's not what we're after we're
for setting settling our training in one
particular way and then representing
representing representing a similar
stimulus
with more and more of it that's the best
way to gain so if you don't standardize
your technique as far as range of motion
you can't do that either
and it's not just you can't track it
you're probably not doing it
right good news standardizing range of
motion solves all these problems right
and here's the thing you can standardize
any range of
it doesn't have to be full you can do a
pin press on the bench from here to here
as you have pins here and pins here like
you put pins at the bottom pins at the
top and you're going ding ding ding ding
and that's technically standardizing me
the same every single week but that
takes a lot of work right you got to put
two sets of pins into a power rack that
means you got to take pins out of the
other rack and the guy's like hey i'm
using that you're like shut up i got to
do my stupid pin press
right also i got to make an inordinate
amount of noise hitting metal on metal
like that's cool if you want to train
like that good thing is full range of
motion makes
a very easy standardization it's auto
standardized most of the time not all
the times remember bicep curls who knows
but usually like you know push-ups how
do you know if you're improving on
push-ups well
every time your chest hits the ground
every time you lock out gee you know
there's not a lot of wiggle room in that
bench press is even easier because
there's no hip bullshit going on you
touch your chest you fully lock out you
shut your chest you feel it lock out
someone's like hey
let's just take the first question here
um how do you know if you're getting
stronger you're like i bent 225
for a set of 10 two months ago today i
got 250 first out of 10.
they're like did you shut your chest
both times you're like yep every single
rep like did you lock out yep every
single breath they're like
gee well you got stronger that's it
problem solved right in all of these
questions get a check mark next to them
if you do
the same range of motion full range of
motion for another example is squatting
all the way
to depth as long as your back doesn't
round making it unsafe for your joints
every time you squat the depth and every
time you come up it's the same squat
basically
so you can standardize that and know
what you're getting every single time
right and squatting is a real good
example
people get in all kinds of fucking
either like i pr on my squat and you
watch them squat like
some reps are below parallel some reps
are above and you're like exactly how
you know you're pr'ing
right you maybe not say that to them to
their face but you sure as hell think it
all right
technical subject here but very related
to the range of motion question
exercise variation is the first one and
fourth curve matching is the second
uh even with a full range of motion
every exercise doesn't stimulate every
part of a muscle
here are some examples inclined curls
right if you're leaning back on an
incline and curling when you stop here
they don't stimulate the shoulder
flexion action of a bicep and thus
probably don't recruit full motor units
in the bicep because some of them are
very very good at the shoulder
reflection part and not very good at
anything else
squats they say for my quadriceps
you might say quads are for your
tri-recepts
i don't know what's going with that one
there are four quadricep
subunits of your muscle but it turns out
that the rectus femoris
attaches across the hip and is only
remotely maximally activated
if you are extending the knee without
simultaneous uh hip extension
uh and or you are extending
the knee uh with simultaneous hip
flexion
like uh that really works well to target
the rectus femoris
in the squat you extend the knee as you
simultaneously extend the hip
so the rectus femoris actually just sort
of it changes its length on the back end
and the front end so it kind of just
sits around doing
more or less a whole lot of nothing so
squats don't activate your rectus
femoris a lot which actually means
that if you want that middle part of
your quad the one that bulges out in the
middle of your quads right there's the
bulge on the outside
inside and the middle the middle is
squats are not a great exercise for that
leg extensions are a pretty decent
exercise for that another really good
exercise for that is hanging like some
weights on your legs
hanging on a bar and kicking your legs
out
while you curl and do an ab curl like
that really blast the rectus femoris
but you know squats don't do that so
when people say squats train your entire
quads like that's actually not true
right um
another really really good example is
the back people say
completely insane things like what's the
best exercise for the back
like okay let's unpack that you're
asking what the best exercise is for
the spinal erectors the lats the terra's
major
the rhomboids the middle traps and
possibly the upper traps
are you gonna find mine you just one
exercise that you might as well ask like
hey what's the best exercise for your
upper body like right here the whole
thing at the same time there is no
exercise like that right
so if you just a lot of people it makes
mindless articles on the internet um
uh you know rows versus pull-ups for
back development
get that out of my face why recon it's
like saying like
pasta versus chicken for you're
constructing a meal you probably need
both
man that's a ridiculous comparison now
if you say for lat hypertrophy that's
one muscle you got a good article on
your hands meadow henselman's has a good
article
in which he shows that rows probably
aren't nearly as good for the lats as
pull-ups overhead pulling
uh that's probably correct right but for
the back that's pure nonsense right
so if you're looking for one exercise
it's just a full enough range of motion
to hit your whole back
you're probably looking for something
that really doesn't exist right
so how do we solve this problem well the
good news is we're not constrained to
one exercise
but there's no like god of hypertrophy
i'm short of ronnie coleman maybe
that's watching over you and saying nope
just one exercise you can't do any more
two to four exercises per mesocycle or
per block of training
is really good for the same muscle but
the two to four exercises can't be
shouldn't be redundant they should be of
differing angles
differing positions of feet and hands to
target as much of
the total muscular muscle group as
possible for example
a possible way to construct um a
back uh hypertrophy uh uh plan a
mesocycle is
have some kind of vertical pull pull ups
have some kind of row
where you do you know barbell rows for
example for a bunch of the rhomboids and
all that other stuff
uh potentially some kind of exercise
where you do a lot of spinal extension
like a like a machine roll where you
really arch up on the pad
for your spinal erectors and then maybe
even an exercise
which it does your lats just by
themselves some kind of pullover if you
have four of those
in in a back a week of training or month
of training or
a block of training or several months
drawing together
then you know you're really covering all
of your basis for your entire back and
you're really really good to go
but if your idea of back training is
like i've literally talked to people
like what do you do for back like pull
ups i'm like
that's it just pull ups huh they're like
yep like sweet you're the man
right that's all you're gonna need for
your lats totally right
most of your lats for everything else
it's just not gonna cut it right so
no reason to do just one exercise so
that really solves a big problem for us
next problem force curve matching so
uh an exercise can
match the force curve of a muscle very
very poorly
um you know for example some bicep
exercises
they're really hard at the bottom but as
soon as you clear the bottom they're
super easy all the way through
and the muscle is really active just at
that range of motion
a lot of motor units are active but and
then
when you fail you always fail at that
range of motion but
there's not really any uh
much stimulus for all the motor units
that are engaged from here on out
yeah they're being activated but very
sub maximally remember some maximal
activation especially if the set isn't
close to failure
which it won't be close to failure to
these motor units it's just not very
good for results it's not very good for
muscle growth
so ideally we want to choose exercises
and machines
that match force curves closely some
very few free weights do this but some
machines so for example squatting
really tough at the bottom not tough at
all at the top
some machines do this pretty well a good
leg extension machine
will be tough at every single part of
the range of motion a good lat pull down
machine or vertical pulling machine will
be tough at
every part of the range of motion a
great rowing machine
very hard at the bottom to give a big
good powerful stretch
gets easier on the way up which is why a
chest supported machine roll
that's not an angle is usually a good
exercise it gets easier at the top so
you can get that top squeeze and engage
all those smaller muscles of your back
that just would never be pushed to their
limits because all you can do is touch
basically
and as soon as you fail those muscles
your lats are barely even turned on
because they're like well gee this
part's so easy because we have to use
enough weight to be able to come all the
way up
right so machines can solve this problem
but you can't use machines for
everything and every time they compare
machines to barbells
or free weights barbells are freeways do
at least as well and sometimes better
so it's not the end-all be-all yes
you want to avoid machines and movements
that are really really crappy to match
force curves
for sure so like if you have two lat
pull-down machines
or two back machines we'll say and one
of them just like it's tough at one part
of the range of motion but it's the
easiest thing in the world at another
and it's not the part of the
range of motion that you want to be easy
then
sometimes it you know if you have
another machine that just fits just
right
using the just right machine is way
better here's an example some assisted
pull-up machines
provide almost no resistance at the
stretch which is stupid because
stretching retention is powerful
and then as you come up it gets harder
and harder which is by the way when you
get mechanically weaker
and you're barely able to get up here
and then it comes back down and there's
no stretch
what a stupid machine people design
these things
a much better assistant pull up machine
is one that really is tough at the
bottom
but as you go up it gets a little bit
easier and you get that ball or squeeze
all the way and then it again super
deeply stretches you
matches the force curve of a bunch of
muscles and hits all of our checklists
for full range of motion full motor unit
recruitment
and stretch under tension definitely
choose those machines however
a lot of this stuff can be solved by
choosing many different exercises
remember you're already choosing two to
four exercises
so if you say like someone says well
even in vertical pulling the lats
technically don't reach the end of their
physiological range of motion not even
close that's totally true because
you know right here your lats aren't
very stretched they are stretched over
here
how can you solve that well you do some
pullovers where your lats are super
stretched
right uh you know some kinds of vertical
pulling barely involve
the uh you know all sorts of other
muscles the back the the traps the
spinal erector so and so forth so you do
some rolling
in addition to that in rows gee rows
don't match the lat force curve almost
at all
but other exercises do right so if you
do two to four different kinds of
exercises
and each time you pick the exercises you
just don't want to pick the ones that
are just
stupidly off the force curve of the
muscle or the exercise
then you end up getting a really good uh
total a total workout you're going to
get a total session and the hypertrophy
is super awesome so
we don't have to get too crazy about
okay we got to modify all the exercises
to be perfect if you do multiple
exercises and they're all decent
they come together to form a really
really good program so
let's take this in and get some
programming considerations in
most cases you want to do the highest
range of motion
the biggest range of motion that does
two things
one doesn't exceed safe muscle or joint
flexibility so if you see someone doing
leg presses and they're super deep but
they're really rounding their back a lot
not good too much range of motion and
two
doesn't radically reduce external
loading and then
because that can reduce total muscle
force generation and sometimes it does
that
via a reduction in stability right so
there's some exercises that the range of
motion is so so for example
if you do dumbbell flies deep enough you
start wobbling at the bottom end
then you can only use like the tens if
you do them a little bit less deep you
could use it for 40s
it's basically an exercise in stretching
you have to reduce the load so much that
even load through the muscle isn't that
great anymore
it's just a matter of getting as big of
a stretch as possible if you want to do
stretch do yoga or pilates
don't bother with hypertrophy training
full range of motion is good
some stretch under tension is good but
you don't want to go so crazy that
you're not
you're reducing the weight so much to be
able to get in that range of motion the
total force
in the intramuscular force falls down a
ton the way you can feel that is you can
actually perceive it it's not rocket
science
you do super crazy way too extended
dumbbells and someone's like man
you feel that in your chest do you do
like a set of ten close to failure and
you're like
to be honest i really feel it in my
tendons and in my joints
but like i don't even have a chest pump
like yeah it's too much range of motion
right but if you do a nice deep range of
motion you're going to feel it a ton on
your chest after you're done with the
set someone's going to be like you feel
that in your trust you're like oh my god
my pecs are going to blow up
whereas if you use much more weight
using a partial range of motion someone
says hey do you feel that in your chest
you're like
yeah it's pretty good and then someone's
like hey go back to much deeper you do
deep and you're like wow that's way way
killer so you can tell these things it's
not
super super crazy you can intuit a lot
of them
you want to choose exercises that match
the
force curves of the muscles as well as
possible
but you don't want to compromise stretch
under tension too much trying to do that
for example um banded leg presses
are they better than regular leg presses
yes probably
because then the leg press doesn't get
easier a ton as you go up however
one of the advantages of leg press is
the massive stretch under tension it
causes your quads at the bottom if you
do it right
you you guys know what i'm talking about
that i've done deep leg presses before
you physically feel your quads deforming
at the bottom especially when you have a
big pump already oh my god it's the end
of the world
that causes a ton of hypertrophic
stimulus by banding
your leg presses and putting a lot of
band tension on you reduce the external
load so much that at the very bottom
there isn't that stretch under tension
thing nearly as much anymore
you're missing a big fraction of the
exercise yes putting bands on things
if it matches the force curve better is
good and if it's not costing you too
much time or energy or really
like throwing off like so for example
people do like dumbbell uh banded
dumbbell presses that's ridiculous
because it's so unstable it's like
a total crapshoot total force production
is way down it's absolutely not worth it
but if you're doing smith machine squats
uh if you're doing
um hack squats for example leg presses
some kind of
machines for the back if you throw on
some light bands you can make the force
curve better
but still get that raw nasty stretch
under tension that you're really really
looking for
and of course lastly you want to choose
two to four exercises per muscle group
per mass or block and they have to be
different angles and a lot of times you
want to attend to the major different
ways in which muscles and muscle groups
are stimulated for example
your pecs for full development probably
need like at least three things
they probably need some flat pressing
work because a lot of times that gets
the sternal pack which decline
is just redundant for and you know flat
or decline work decline works just tough
to set up so it's stupid
um incline work because that terror
trains the clavicular packs different
part of the muscle
won't be maximally active with flat and
some flies
preferably flies that you can do regular
dumbo flies are totally cool
but every now and again you want to
throw on some flies where they're
machine loaded
and you get peak contraction so when you
come all the way in or even across like
this
you get a lot of contraction at the very
tip which you don't get
very much with bench presses of any kind
right or any presses of any kind
and you don't get even with free
dumbbell flies because
by the time you get here gravity doesn't
pull the flies apart anymore
right so that's a really really good
idea to make sure you checklist so
basically every major function and
limiting factor of the muscle
it's not that hard to do but if you get
it done you're going to be
in line for maximum hypertrophy
summary implications last slide here
full range of motion can sometimes sound
like meaningless dogma
if people don't know why they're saying
it absolutely is meaningless dogma at
least
as far as they're concerned so it's got
limits
right you don't do eight-inch deficit
deadlifts while rounding your back like
crazy and screaming full rombo
like yo you'll be screening a lot worse
things when your discs pop out of your
ass and
hit somebody in the face right that
being said larger ranges of motion
usually have advantages so long as
they're still producing lots of force
like not the 10-pound dumbbell example
for flies
and as long as they're safe if that's
the case if something is producing lots
of force
and if it's safe and you can feel the
muscle being tensed which is
exactly what force production is it's
probably a good thing to do as much ram
as you can given those two things
are checked off the list so a good
default on most exercises
is what i would call externally viewed
full range of motion so like full squats
touching the bar to your tummy on rows
like if you're stopping the bar like
three inches away from the stomach on
rows like we're going to ask why and
there's probably no good answer to that
chin over the bar on pull-ups you know
maybe you can if you touched your
uh chest on pull-ups that'd be great not
everyone's strong enough to do that so
it's you know as long as you get your
chin up or close that's good
so on and so forth that's the default
that's where it starts and you have to
use your intellect
take yourself through all four of these
goals check mark them and see where you
are you know safe where you could be
extending the wrong
how you feel the exercise best there's
always room for nuance right
if i see someone in the gym that's
squatting well below parallel but not
all the way down
i don't automatically think they're a
stupid person and they're moral for
cutting their depth
i'm interested in why they might say you
know actually my knee hurts if i go
lower than this
or you know i actually feel my quads
less at the bottom because my glutes
activate more
that's totally fine it's totally cool no
big deal there it's all about individual
adjusting to their considerations and uh
sort of adjusting the default rom to get
the best possible hypertrophic stimulus
based on all these chakras folks thanks
