hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization today's
fitness myth number 10 in our series so
far
high fructose corn syrup is uniquely bad
for you
that's a myth what on a related note i
was walking around last night and i saw
a family nuclear family
daughter son wife husband and the
husband is clutching all three of the
other family members while high fructose
corn syrup monster
was encroaching
on their very sense of family and
liberty and everything that was good and
i i did nothing about it i'm a really
lazy fair kind of person so i was like
i wonder how this will play out the high
fructose corn syrup monster ate every
single one of them brutally like like
like a velociraptor whatever from
jurassic park it ate them while they
were still alive the worst thing i've
ever seen in my life so how am i going
to show up and defend high fructose corn
syrup watch this so what's the claim
really
the claim
is that high fructose corn syrup is
uniquely bad for you even compared to
other sugars like honey cane sugar table
sugar etc
and another claim that like people like
to layer on this is that high fructose
corn syrup introduction and
proliferation and expansion in the food
supply has somehow either caused or
massively contributed to the obesity
epidemic that folks are experiencing
nowadays
uh interesting hypotheses but probably
wrong and here's why
so
first high fructose corn syrup seems to
be bad and if you google fructose
negative effects you get all sorts of
things you're like ah that's it it's the
high fructose that's killing us why
couldn't
we know that regular sugar was better
why do we have to jam in more fructose
artificially i might add well the thing
is high fructose corn syrup is only high
fructose when compared to corn syrup
which has almost no fructose at all
so it turns out that compared to like
table sugar and honey the high fructose
corn syrup has like the same amount of
fructose or really close
oh
that changes things
and it turns out that high fructose corn
syrup is postulated that it has an
appetite mediating effect and it makes
you less full it doesn't make you any
less full than table sugar honey it
seems like from the studies that seem to
be available so it's another curiosity
and a lot of studies have been done on
this and most of them show that in
nearly all health effects high fructose
corn syrup isn't amazing for your health
but it's no different than other uh
sweet tasting sugar sources like cane
sugar and sucrose and honey and so on
and so forth
which makes those like natural sugar uh
soft drinks like now with natural sugar
really stupid
because it's really like the
naturalistic fallacy or the argument
from nature fallacy writ large there it
is it's just natural and if you look
into the data and the research like oh
it's actually
damn near the same thing so why is it
better well it's not and that's really
the reality here
now there's some grains of truth here
that we don't just write off first
any caloric sweetener that can let you
add calories fast
is a candidate for helping obesity get
to where it is and that's absolutely
true
generally speaking
liquid beverages that taste sweet and
have lots of carbs are not as filling as
protein starches and healthy fats uh
definitely veggies so if you have a
bunch of liquid calories through the day
of sugar it's actually quite easy to get
in tons of extra calories and end up
being
significantly more overweight than you
planned on
and that's really true it's true for
cookies and snacks and sweets and cakes
but it's really true for liquids because
they're so easy to get down you eat a
regular meal super healthy meal you have
like a nice large tall glass of orange
juice with that meal
and all of a sudden that's like 50 grams
of extra carbohydrate per meal
that is going to increase your calories
a ton and not make you much fuller so
you'll be just as hungry for dinner or
lunch or comparably so
and then over the course of the day if
you keep that up you know orange juice
with breakfast you know coca-cola with
lunch and then make a few glasses of
wine
with dinner that's a lot of extra
calories right so that's where it's not
good is that it can let you bump your
calories without experiencing much of an
anti-hunger effect and
statistically
folks that take in lots of juices and
sodas have pretty similar outcomes so
you know high fructose corn syrup that's
available in soda which is usually not
available in fruit juice
it's not any better for you okay so it
definitely uh does bad things by
providing excess calories particularly
without making you less hungry um but
the cool point here is that you know
people say oh we stay natural just drink
regular juice well
they're most juices are free of high
fructose corn syrup but pretty much do
the same stuff outcome wise they leave
the same body fat gain etc etc so that
doesn't let the high fructose corn syrup
off the hook but it just hangs it next
to its other co-conspirators who are
just as bad right it's like you know you
got two people like taking the rims off
a car or something and you're like that
guy's doing a bad thing and someone's
like what about that other guys doing
the same thing
that guy's natural it's cool oh did i
just make an accidental net or not joke
i sure did
if you juice to the gills you can
probably rip off more rims i don't know
i've
only stolen a few things in my life and
they're always diamonds
do you guys ever want to be like uh like
a super heist thief
uh you know like uh go after like crazy
paintings and diamonds and
i don't know i never really did but it
seems like a lavish lifestyle best
practices back to work best practices
what do we take from here well
excess sweetened caloric beverage
consumption
is one of the easiest ways to increase
your calories from any baseline you want
to add a bunch of calories i'm not
saying the good ones just drink more of
your carbs drink more sugary beverages
this happens with any sweeteners not
just high fructose corn syrup it happens
with beverages even the crew the natural
food store ones it's like flavored
naturally with honey you're like oh my
god bees like honey and they
hurt when they sting you i don't know
bees are good right they're nature
so what you probably want to do
especially if you're trying to control
your weight against all odds is stay
mostly away from juices and sodas and
junk sweet treats most the time because
those tons of extra carbohydrates just
like the tons of extra fats of easily
fried foods they just contribute to a
whole bunch more calories and not as
much anti-hunger properties so it's
really easy to get carried away to
chronically take in more calories than
you actually burn away and then you end
up gaining weight over the long term so
diet drinks are totally cool diet drinks
is super safe water of course is always
great and you can sparkling water
regular water and uh diet sodas that's
all good stuff i would stick to that
and you can absolutely eat delicious
sweet treats within moderation but just
make sure it's within your calorie
constraint it's not something that's a
part of your life and you're not
tracking anymore you come to your doctor
six months later he's like you've gained
20 pounds of fat
like that what's your diet like i don't
know well yes i've been eating a whole
lot of cake and drizzling the cake with
orange juice what
that's strange
um
last thing i'll say here is
the idea that high fructose corn syrup
is the sort of cornerstone and
the fractal generator of the entire
obesity epidemic
actually links into a bit of a logical
fallacy that people have when when
looking at large systems
and that is the attempt to find one
flip switch
single variable fallacy
the single variable responsible for it
all it would be neat and a lot of people
will do this for health all the time and
especially the obesity epidemic it's
like a national pastime what's the cause
of the obesity what one thing what one
chemical because here's the thing it'd
be really neat right if we found that as
high fructose corn syrup that's really
causing the obese epidemic which is the
easiest legislation in the world to
write to be like just know more of this
in our food as a matter of fact
a competitive free market like the
united states you probably have to write
it as soon as like 10 studies came out
and all the medical associations were
like high fructose corn syrup is legit
just causing obesity nothing else is how
many companies would still sell it
everyone would be like that we're
just going to switch to another sugar
it's going to cost us pennies on the
dollar and we're not going to be like
implicated in those crazy stuff anymore
we're still going to be able to sell
product
it would be a thing it would be awesome
it would be easy but but that's not the
reality of why the obesity epidemic
occurs is all the available evidence we
have
is straightforward for the most part
there could be some missing pieces here
but generally it's this
people are wealthier relative to the
amount of food they can purchase more
than ever
they have spent decades
telling companies by supply and demand
and actual you know focus groups they
want
tastier things
they love the way high calorie foods
taste they want them as convenient as
possible and readily available
everywhere so now junk foods and hyper
unfilling drinks
and all the stuff
that's really what's causing the obesity
epidemic is you like to eat super cheap
super convenient ultra tasty food that
makes you want more of itself like i
never had one twinkie in my life ah
twinkie twinkie i have
potato chip i need like 80 of them shits
man as soon as i taste one i need more
and twinkies two why not and a
dark version of a twinkie the chocolate
one with the the white cream the what i
should call the ho hos or something uh
videoer for scott what are they called
hohos
amazing
amazing so two part answer
be healthy control your diet eat in
moderation and when you do eat in
moderation get some ho ho's in your life
