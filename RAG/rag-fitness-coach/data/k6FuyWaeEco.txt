hey folks
dr mike isrtel here for renaissance
periodization strength training made
simple number three
how should you warm up for strength
training
first of all why should you warm up
warming up does three really really good
things
first by warming up the tissues it fit
actually reduces
the chance of injury which is really
really awesome yeah can you cold
press 300 pounds sure which might tear
your pack off
not a good thing secondly as you warm up
and do lighter weights to heavier
weights your technique becomes
more efficient and improves and thus by
the time you lift your heaviest weight
that
better technique can literally let you
lift more weight and have better
workouts that make you
stronger lastly as you lift heavier and
heavier weight
independent of the technique improvement
your nervous system starts to wake up
it becomes potentiated and then it can
physically output
more of a message for contraction to the
muscles that you're using
lifting more weight like that can allow
you not only to be stronger in the
moment but actually give you better
workouts so you can get stronger
over time more efficiently now
to the meat and potatoes how to actually
warm up these are just
very general guidelines situation to
situation there's
lots of room for fungibility we'll say
different approaches but fundamentally
first you can choose to do some light
cardio for like five or ten minutes
before
you don't have to the stronger and
bigger you get the more your actual
warm-ups with the lift
take more time and thus you get a better
warm-up
and you don't really need the cardio but
if you're just beginning strength
training
cardio to begin with is totally fine
something nice and easy to get you a
little bit of a sweat and then you're
good to go
point number two your first warm-up with
the actual lift itself so if you're
training for bench press this will be
the bar on the bench just like the
competition lift itself
will be with like your 20 rep max
or lighter than that so something you
could do for at least 20 reps okay
you're going to do it for around 10 reps
so it's super sub maximal
just moving around to get the blood
flowing and get the technique going for
the lift
then you have your 20 rm thing that you
did for 10 that first weight
and then you have your first working set
of super heavy weight
you're going to do at least one set no
matter how heavy or light it is
between those two and that's going to be
a set for
oh maybe around five ish reps or so
okay at the very very least and that's
going to be halfway between those two
lifts
so if you're 20 rm ish weight is like 50
pounds
and then 150 pounds is your heavy sets
of five
maybe you do a set of five with a
hundred pounds and then you can jump
into that lift next
but the heavier the weight is on the bar
the more
intermediate steps you want to take so
for example if it's 0 to 50 pounds that
you're lifting
one intermediate step with a set of five
is totally fine and then you can go
too close to the heavy weight to do your
last warm-up so that's totally fine
generally these are very general
guidelines you can move them around a
little bit but
lifts that are 50 to 200 pounds right
like if if you're gonna be doing
you know pull-ups with your body weight
and you weigh 180 pounds or something
like that
two intermediate sets is a good idea so
maybe a first set of 10
right and then two intermediate sets and
then the last heavy set before you go
so maybe like a set of eight and like a
set of six or a set of eight and then a
set of four and then
your last uh super heavy warm-up which
we'll talk about in a sec
if it's 200 to 400 pounds more like
three intermediate sets if
it's 400 pounds plus as needed and by
the time you get that strong in most
cases you'll know your body really well
generally speaking stronger people need
more of a warm-up i've seen guys take
eight
different warm-ups to get up to
squatting a thousand pounds not everyone
squats a thousand pounds so not everyone
needs eight warm-ups but you need them
as you can take them and
over time you'll learn what's best for
your body point number four
the last warm-up you're going to do is
at the working weight itself or around
90
of it either way works really really
well it's your call which one makes you
feel
less fatigued and thus stronger after a
little bit of a break
and that's the potentiation set usually
you do it for just one or two reps
what it's designed to do is wake up your
nervous system and get you
really used to lifting that heavy weight
that you're gonna be lifting you don't
want your last warm-up to be like a set
of five
and you just go right into a super heavy
set of five because the last set of five
wasn't that heavy
you want one or two with that 5rm or
really close to it
so you get the bar weight feeling of
like oh
this is what my weight's going to feel
like you do one or two reps you rack
doesn't tire you out a ton but it really
potentiates you wakes up your nervous
system
really quick not addressed on the slides
how long of a break do you take between
these
long enough to feel really really good
and totally fine and not tired not
fatigued at all
so if you just finish your set of 10 on
the first warm-up and you're going
don't go yet go until your breathing is
calm and you feel strong and competent
again but don't worry we'll have a later
video about rest times between work sets
just thought i'd throw this out there
for the warm-ups as well now two notes
here
during this warm-up system note number
one is for every single rep
in this entire warm-up you want to
practice exact lift technique some
people rush their warm-ups
usually their bench is solid and they do
a real good job but for the first set of
ten they'll just do this
it's a good opportunity for you to arch
retract position well
and practice every single even lift with
the bar
just the bar exactly like you would a
competition bench press
that is a better way to warm up and it
makes you technically better at the lift
not just that day
but days and months and weeks later
because it's more practice
the right way versus being lazy on the
warm-ups and practicing
the wrong way right that it even means
bracing for every single lift so
if you're squatting the bar and you're a
serious strength trainee
it means you get under just the bar and
you go
and you squat it normally instead of
just be like because you're practicing a
poor pattern that you'll have to change
just after that now second note
is let's say you have a first lift this
is how you should warm up really
thoroughly
if you have a second lift that trains
many of the same muscles and movements
let's say a squat first and the front
squat after
you can skip a couple of these steps and
shorten it a little bit let's get to an
example to see exactly what i mean
so just an example not dogma this can
move around a little bit no big deal
just if you're squatting sets of five
with 300 pounds that's your target
working weight multiple sets
how do you warm up here's a way you can
do it you squat the bar for 10 reps
every single rep looks just like it
would in a power lifting me
135 for 6 225 for 4 275 for two
300 for that one potentiation rep to get
you're really used to the weight
and then you begin your working sets of
300 pounds on the
now per that earlier example let's say
you squat it and now you're front
squatting
how does that shortened warm up look
well you just squat it up to 300 for
sets of five
now you're doing sets of five in the
front squat with 250 after what do you
do we switched to front squats and you
do 135 for five reps
notice we skipped the bar all together
but look your quads are generally warm
you don't need just the bar
135 for five 225 for three
big jump but again you're generally warm
and very potentiated you just need to
get used to front squatting
250 for one rep and then you're ready to
go much shorter warm-up because you're
already
mostly warmed up you just need that
little extra bit to be warmer
specifically
for the actual front squat folks thanks
for tuning in
see you next time for the next video
