hey folks dr michael churchill here for
lecture number six in muscle gain
nutrition
adjusting calories and macros let's see
what
is on the agenda first in contents is
how to know when to adjust calories
because hypothetically have your plan
set up and you should be going
pretty well sometimes adjustments are
needed we'll talk about when that is and
how to determine that
we're going to talk about how to adjust
calories up how to raise calories how to
adjust them down
reasons to adjust proteins carbs and
fats and what kind of adjustments those
would look like so let's get
right into the thicker things first up
you always want to have a planned
rate of gain right
which means that you have a final
planned body weight because you have a
planned rate of gain
and a planned cessation time like you
might want to get
you know gain a half a percent of weight
per week
and get from 180 pounds to 200 pounds
and you know whatever
however much time that is six months or
something like that right
and what that means is that every single
week of the diet you'll have like an
expected
average body weight or something like
that right and it's not an exact science
because there's you know
all these fluctuations for water but
you're going to have a band
like a range and it's maybe like a
quarter of a percent
up and down where the average weight for
that week
is going to be within the band right
and that's close enough to target that
it's good to go so for example
if you weigh you know a couple weeks in
you weigh 187 pounds on your way up to
200
and you sort of expected to weigh 186
you're good to go right if you weigh 189
pounds or 190 pounds
you're probably up a little bit too much
and you might need to make an adjustment
but it's within
you know g really one or two pounds up
and down is generally okay
unless you know you're gaining very
slowly and then even that could be a
big change so remember this is weekly
average not any one weight at any one
time
here's the thing before we get into
these adjustments huge huge public
service announcement
the first week of a mass gained diet of
a muscle gain diet
is going to be a wash because when you
go from eating
less carbs and less food to more carbs
and more food in the first week
you're going to have a ton of body water
addition which is going to jack your
body weight up by like five pounds or
something like that
ignore the first week so really you have
your final weight that you want to weigh
and then you have your weight that you
weigh after about a week of dieting
and that's when you start your
projection of applying your rate of gain
between one and the other and taking how
much time you need
right so the first week we just wash
away we just throw away it's like a
curiosity you can still take your weight
in the first week but you're really not
going to be paying attention to it
it's just going to be hilarious how much
water weight you can gain once your
first week is good
your second week third week so on you
want to track weight
and see if a change occurs
here's the fundamental rules and then
we're going to go to how to adjust based
on these rules here are the fundamentals
number one
if your weight is within your acceptable
band of gains
right acceptable band of weight that you
could weigh
right if your weight is in there between
like 191 and 189 one week or something
you do nothing at all for that week
if it's significantly below the band you
increase calories duh and if it's
significantly above the band you
decrease calories
fundamentally right and you repeat
those processes that logic for the rest
of the weeks as the weeks come in
so if you know on week four you're
significantly heavier than you should be
you're probably gonna lower calories a
little bit in week five and six you may
be right in that band
and by week seven you're gaining weight
your metabolism speeding up
you might need to eat more food because
you're outside of the band already on
the low side and you're gonna need to
add calories so your weight's gonna go
like this
and you're gonna be trying to stay
within this band makes pretty decent
sense
all right so how do we adjust calories
up
and in other words if you are below
the band of gains here's we have this
band of gains that's acceptable and
let's say we're weighing in right here
an
average for the week not just one
measurement if you got one measurement
that's really low don't do anything
about it don't worry about it
wait until a whole week elapses
measurements average all of them
and then that number is instructed right
so our weekly average is
below where we want to be well
how much do we add here's the thing
couple of rules
first point if you're just under that
band
like real close we can even say like
plus or minus a pound
away from the band right or minus a
pound
let's say the bottom end of that band is
193 pounds if you're like 192
to 193 um just add
10 to your calories right
so that's gonna for example if you're
2000 calories you're going to add 200
calories to that
really simple you're going to add that
at the end of that week
and for the next week you're going to
eat just like that and see how that week
turns out
all right really really simple now even
if you're up to
two percent off of that bottom figure
right so like 200 pounds two percent is
four pounds so if you expect to weigh
200 pounds
but you even weigh as little as 196
right up to
or all the way to 196 not more than 196
but all the way like 196.1
that's quite a bit off than a pound but
if the trend line of your gains is in
the right direction still
and is going to intercept your goal
still add 10 percent what do i mean by
that
you're going to have this band that goes
from the beginning of your diet to the
end of the diet
right the end is let's say 210 pounds
okay and the beginning is 190. if you
are gaining weight all right and
generally speaking you've been up over
the weight you've been below it
and if you're below it but if we do a
trend line which is super easy to do in
excel
and your trend line gets to 200 pounds
or above at the end
even if you have a real low weigh and
average week because your trend line is
still
in that general direction and is still
going to intercept 200 by the end of the
diet
you don't have anything to worry about
just add 10 still
right why are we saying that basically
what we mean
is look you had a bad week so to speak a
real underweight week
but the average of all your measurements
for all the other weeks including that
one
still puts you on track to hit if you
made
really big changes let's say we added a
ton of food because we're like oh geez
we're like almost two percent off
we could throw that line up even higher
so your average will start to go crazy
then you would just have to make crazy
cuts later on
so if we're still in the right general
trend but we had an off week that's
really low
up to two percent no worries just add 10
percent and look
if you haven't gotten into the weight
band after a week of 10
you can add another 10 just the same way
no big deal
now if you're 2 off or more so 196 and
below
so like 195 or something like that
you're supposed to be 200
right and if your slope of the line of
gains
does not intercept 200 like basically
let's say if it kept going like this
like your prediction line
of all the data you've entered so far is
like 197
okay okay i'm never going to hit 200 if
i keep eating like this
then you go up by 20 calories per day
which is a big
increase right 20 calories if you're
eating 3000 calories that's
600 calories added that's a big deal so
notice that 20 calories because it's
such a big deal it's not something we
want to get in the habit of just adding
like every week and then having to take
it away adding every week
basically the general rule here is like
if you're pretty much on track don't do
anything
right if you are just a little off track
add 10 calories if you're a little bit
more than a little off track but the
general trend line is in the right
direction
don't fret add 10 because you can always
do it a week later
but if you're really significantly off
to the point where your entire trend
line says you're not going to meet your
goal if you keep dieting like this
up by 20 problem solver not anything
super complicated
just takes a little bit of diligence
what about adjusting down
well here's the deal why do we just down
well
here's your gained band right of
acceptable rates of gain
and now you're weighing up here above
the bench you're a little too heavy
for that time in the diet like you know
you still have like eight weeks left of
the diet to 200 pounds
and you already weigh 198. it's like uh
okay
that's a bit much so what do we do
here's the deal if you're just over that
band again if you're within that band do
nothing
just the diet's still working it's super
great if you're just over that band
what you can do is subtract five percent
from your calories
if you're just over it so within
two percent of error uh or like within
one percent or something like that
uh uh just five percent no big deal
right and and that means you know if
you're a 2000 calorie diet you subtract
100 calories notice it's a smaller
change
than addition why if you're a little bit
heavy
on a mass gain diet you basically gained
weight a little
too earlier ahead of schedule all we
need to do
is you can still technically be gaining
we just need to take your rate of gain
and poke it down a little
so it intercepts back into the band
pretty soon
we don't want to say oh my god we're up
we're 198 we're supposed to be 197. this
is
terrible look it's not terrible because
next week if you stay 198 or even if
you're like 199.5
you might already be into the band
because the band goes up we just have to
make sure
we don't go up faster than the band
right so what you don't want to do is
freak out and be like oh my god i'm
going to cut 500 calories
and the next week you're below you don't
want a diet
in which you're cutting above below
above below above below which means you
have to modify
every week that's crazy a real good
masking diet man every
two to four weeks you might have to
modify but you've got long runs in there
where you're eating the same amount of
food and you're still in the right band
right you're still in the good gain bad
so we're just gonna subtract five
percent
super super easy basically just cool it
on the eating a little bit
and that band is going to catch right up
and everything's gonna be good
now even if you're two percent up to two
percent above
right which means like you know you're
supposed to weigh
200 pounds but you weigh 204 pounds okay
but if your trend line is in the right
direction which means
that all of your other weigh-ins were
really on track uh right on schedule
and you know your uh your trend line is
uh so so basically you're still on track
and
your last week is just uh really
aberrant and it's really high
like you've been great great great
within the band even below the band
sometimes
your trend line really aligns super
close to the band uh and
uh you know last week is just like you
just ballooned up for no reason
it's it's probably an aberrant week so
we're not gonna go crazy and reduce
stuff
we're just gonna still subtract five
percent and if
the line intercepts the diet goal right
so basically
if your slope line gets super close to
the 200 pounds when it needs to
right and maybe just a little bit under
or even just a little bit over we're
totally good
but like if you keep eating like this
you're going to weigh 210 pounds by the
time you're supposed to weigh 200
that's a bad deal okay so
still good there just subtract five
percent now if you're two percent or
more
and if your slope exceeds the intercept
the final goal
by more than two percent which means
what if you're
200 pounds you're supposed to be 200
pounds at the end of the diet
but right now if you kept dieting at
this you would get 204 or above
if you stopped right your your trend
line is pointed like way above 200
if you kept eating like this then we're
going to reduce by 10
calories per day that's a big reduction
the thing is that's probably not going
to be something you use all the time
and here's why if you make a couple of
these 10 adjustments after a while you
get your diet pretty close to dialed in
and it's going to be really really close
and you'll probably just have to do five
percent from there on out sometimes you
get really bloated blah blah blah
but remember these are weekly averages
it's not just like what you weigh in a
monday
it's what you weigh in monday wednesday
friday average together or all the days
average together so
really a ton of adjustment is not
usually necessary but a little bit here
and there
just to keep us as close to that band of
ideal weight gain
as we can all right
what about protein adjustment so
the first reason that we need to adjust
any macro
is simply for calorie adjustment right
like a lot of times the reason we add
carbs where you add fats isn't because
there's some magic on anti-carbs or fats
it's because we need more calories and
they got to come from somewhere
but here's the deal adding protein as a
way of adding calories isn't the
greatest idea protein's expensive
macronutrient like protein foods cost
more
and because we're getting like at least
around a gram per pound of
some of the stuff we talked about
earlier in the lectures adding more
protein doesn't make you more jacked and
there's easier and more palatable ways
and cheaper ways to add calories carbs
and fats right
so protein should really be well in line
so no adjustment on that really needs to
be made but there are other reasons to
adjust protein
and if you want your calories to stay
the same adjusting protein up or down
will mean you'll have to add carbs and
fats to compensate
for example if your protein is too high
for you it could cause gi distress
and you might reduce your protein still
keeping it in that in that
range of acceptable for optimal for
muscle mass gains
but maybe on the lower end of that range
like you try to eat like
1.25 grams per pound per day and you're
just not digesting
well and stuff sitting around and you
feel pretty sick
you go down to a gram you feel great a
gram is definitely enough so you're good
to go that's a potential adjustment
if your protein is again too high you
might have problems
um with uh hunger right
so and there's two problems here right
so you can have
two not enough hunger which means that
you are getting stuffed and protein is
remember
really filling food so if you're trying
to eat 1.25 grams of protein per pound
of body weight per day
and you're barely getting the food in
what you can do is reduce to one gram
increase your carbs it's way more
palatable you're not as
stuffed and you can get the food in more
easily on the other hand there are
situations where you have
too much hunger hold on a second on a
masking how does that work well for
example
if you do a real hard fat loss phase or
your post body building competition or
something like that
you know post bodybuilding competition
if we really ask people to eat just
whatever they wanted
they're not going to eat their 3 300
calories per day
of good macro foods to masking at a
really decent rate
if for the first couple of weeks they
might eat like 5 000 calories per day
and just gain a ton of fat taking them
way above their optimal gain rate right
that's a bad deal
so what you might do is your protein
might be too low
right and what that means is if you jack
up your protein
from one gram to 1.25 you might have
less hunger and it'll be easier
to stay full get all your meals in gain
the weight and then eventually a couple
of weeks a couple months later
all the food is really filling you don't
have to worry about that kind of stuff
anymore
here's another one uh meal palatability
if you have a ton of protein or not
enough protein
your meals can be more or less appealing
based on that for example um
you can have a situation where you're
eating like a ton of carbs and not a lot
of protein
and it's enough protein technically to
meet your needs but like it's this
little piece of chicken breast and
there's like a mound of rice you know
most most of us like to cut up our
chicken
you know eat like a mouthful of chicken
and then some rice mouthful chicken and
some rice you guys ever get in a
situation where you've like
killed off all of your chicken and you
look and there's like 10 pounds of rice
and you're like
can i just eat more meat to sort of
match the meal tastes better there's
nothing wrong with that as long as
you're getting enough carbs to meet your
needs
you can eat more protein just for
palatability now of course you don't
want this
ratio to get too crazy you don't want to
eat so much protein that you can't eat
enough food
as long as you're getting your food in
you can eat a bit more protein just
subtract the carbs away and it all makes
sense in the end
right and real big
big statement here so those are some
examples of good reasons to change your
protein remember always change your
carbs and fats to match calories
here's the deal if your protein is when
the acceptable range
you know roughly 0.75 to 1.5 grams per
pound
per day i'm not making gains fast enough
it's not a reason for protein adjustment
if your protein is already in the
optimum range
eating more protein will not make you
gain muscle faster if
only that was true it's just not
protein after a certain point for sure a
gram per pound per day
is just not a limiting factor for
hypertrophy so if you're already eating
gram per pound or in that region
and you're like geez i wish i could gain
more muscle faster i'm going to eat more
protein
false if you do eat more protein you
might notice that you gain weight faster
but you could have gained more weight
faster
if you ate carbs and the effect on
anabolism would have been the same as a
matter of fact
carbs once your protein is met are
probably even more anabolic than protein
if we add them
so don't make this fallacy of adjusting
your protein up to just get more gains
bro because once you're in that good
range
protein is not something you should be
worried about
what about carbs so a huge reason
for adding carbs this is just so is to
supply the
calorie adjustment all right a huge
reason to add carbs
to supply the calorie adjustment so
basically we need more calories
all right and we eat more carbs okay
great
for calories per gram for carbohydrates
makes total sense
right and that's almost always the case
with carbs
i would advise if you have to adjust
your calories
and you don't sort of care from a taste
perspective or any other reason
where the calories come from i would say
if you have a good baseline mass gaining
diet adjusting
your carbs is the way nine times out of
ten
to adjust your calories up so if you're
eating 600 grams of carbs per day on a
mass gain phase
and you need to add 200 more calories i
would just add 50 grams of carbs that's
a really good way to go about things
now there are other reasons to adjust
carbs that one
you consider you're eating enough carbs
already to meet your energy needs your
glycogen re-synthesis needs so on and so
forth
you can play a little bit with your
carbs for these reasons
for example you could just decide
that you can't eat this many fucking
carbs anymore it's just too many carbs
you just want to make it simpler on
yourself you can't eat this much food
anymore
you can choose to add fats and you can
choose to reduce carbs
like you're you know you have 600 grams
of carbs and you went to 650 and you're
like i can't do 650.
so you cut back to 600 and you add in
you know 35 grams of fat or something
like that it's roughly the same amount
of calories
you're good to go on that end you've
added the calories but it just couldn't
be from carbs you had to produce carbs
totally fine as long as
you're not chasing carbs down to really
low numbers it still has to be a lot of
carbs there's no way around that
right another concern
is you need more training energy and you
need more recovery so what you're going
to do is increase your carbs and
lower your fats um it's really rare
why is it rare when we do the sort of
mirror image of this lecture
in another rp plus series on fat loss
we're going to see that adjusting to eat
more carbs and fewer fats is really
powerful
that's because fat loss is a hypochloric
environment
training energy is at a premium it's
hard to find the more recovery you can
get the better so on and so forth thing
is
when you're mass gaining man you're
swimming in nutrients
usually you got more than enough carbs
to know what to do with unless you chose
to ate a really high fat diet
for example if you've got like 200 grams
of fat on your diet and 300 grams of
carbs
you might wipe away 100 grams of fat and
add in you know
damn near 200 grams of carbs that could
make a significant difference but if
you're already eating
according to our macro recommendations
from earlier and you're eating
close to enough carbs to really get you
going everywhere it's going to be pretty
rare that you don't have enough carbs
for training energy reasons so on and so
forth
lastly adjusting fats number one reason
we adjust anything
is for calories and that's absolutely
something we can use fats for
all right now when would fats compose
some or even all of your calorie
adjustments
right remember default is carbs so we
have to have good reasons
for using fats instead to add or
subtract from calories specifically to
add
all right first one is you're okay with
not upping carbs and missing out on
those
super anabolic benefits and you want to
eat more fats
for two reasons taste or convenience
look let's be honest
higher fat foods when carbs are already
high it's like where every delicious
food lives
okay people say i love carbs like carbs
or junk food carbs are why people gain
weight uh
false carbs and fats together are junk
food that's why people gain weight
right i don't know how many people have
ever gained weight eating a low fat diet
it's incredibly rare
but all well why because all the best
tasting foods are high carb and high fat
french fries ice cream pizza
cheeseburgers shakes i mean you can
literally just go down the list cookies
brownies all of them are high fat and
high carb so if you eat a very high carb
low fat diet
you'll gain awesome optimal muscle so on
and so forth fat gains will be minimum
but you miss out on a lot of really
tasty foods
and if your fats are low enough you miss
out on most of them right you can't even
spare a cookie here and there because a
cookie has like half your daily fats by
that point
so potentially you can add fats to your
diet as calories rise instead of adding
carbs
knowing that you're giving up on the
small benefits there but you get to eat
a really wide variety of foods you get
more junk food all is well and hey when
you're massing go to town just know
that if you're not super happy with the
results of your mass maybe you gained a
little bit more fat than you wanted and
didn't gain as much muscle as you wanted
next time you run a muscle gain phase or
mass phase
you can try to eat a little fewer fats a
little bit more carbs you'll probably
have better results but a lot of people
get great results off plenty of fats
no big deal and if you're okay with that
trade-off that's good to go
another one very related is convenience
all right
when you're on the road when you're
cooking your own food when you're eating
with your family
you know how often are you going to get
a meal of pasta that's 50 grams of
protein
125 grams of carbs and 10 grams of fat
there's no restaurant in the world
that's not a health food store
that's going to make you a pasta dish
with chicken
that has 10 grams of fat in it for that
many carbs it's out of this
world that's only home cooking right
very meticulous home cooking i might add
so a lot of times you might add more
fats into your meals
just for sheer convenience so you can
eat more normal
foods not just the tasty foods but foods
that are all around
look at it this way if you are traveling
and you have to eat at a subway
or you have to eat at a gas station or
something like maybe you don't eat at
the gas station that sounds real
depressing you just buy some gas station
food and eat it
try to figure out if you had 100 grams
of carbs to take in
and 50 grams of protein or so try to
keep your fats under 10 grams
total for the meal see how difficult
that becomes most
protein bars are no longer acceptable
what the hell
beef jerky you'd have to buy the leanest
kind of jerky which is around but tastes
like crap
where are you going to get your carbs
from like just bananas are pretty much
low
fat or fat free but you're just going to
eat bananas the whole time
lay's baked potato chips are great
source of carbs when you're traveling
but they have already too much fat to
meet those guidelines right
it's real real pain in the ass so
sometimes just sheer convenience you're
just going to add some fast to your diet
when it's time to add food
if your carbs are already super high
it's not a big deal
like if you eat 70 grams of fat per day
versus 100
the 100 grams of fat versus 70 is not
going to be a huge difference in your
results i mean unless you're real
serious about this stuff that might be
worth it
like if you're like trying to be a pro
bodybuilder or something but uh if
you're not if you just want muscle and
good gains and stuff like that eating
100 grams of fat versus 70
and cutting the splitting the difference
of 650 grams of carbs versus 600 it's
really not going to be a huge difference
in results possibly at all
but you're going to get a real big boost
in convenience 100 grams of fat to work
with per day man that's a couple 25 gram
of fat meals that's some of the stuff
you could definitely eat at the gas
station for sure
right so the convenience is definitely
up another one is
potentially why you would add fats
instead is you just can't stand add more
carbs you're just done with carbs i've
been as high as 900 grams of carbs per
day for several weeks i'm telling you
it's like
a real real nuisance like you just can't
the carbs are people say i love carbs i
fantasize about them like you'll stop
fantasizing about when you have to jam
900
grams of those things down your throat
so sometimes psychologically you just
can't stand any more carbs
particularly this reflects in like um
you know like taste of food
like you you're like i love rice you're
like okay here's bland chicken breast
oh it's completely lean here's like you
know half a pound of white rice
and they're like okay what can i put on
as far as condiments are like soy sauce
like
what else like ketchup like that's gross
can i put like some
some kind of like zesty mayo like nope
too many fats like
can i have a dab of peanut butter nope
too many fats you're like man
that's going to be a whole lot of dry
carbs and protein like yep sure will be
there's no way around that sometimes you
just get tired of eating dry food all
the time
during a mass gain this should be some
fun you should eat some tasty foods so
sometimes if you're already eating a ton
of carbs
you're not trying to be like a
professional bodybuilder or something
and even in that case i think it's okay
to up the fats a little bit just to give
yourself some breathing room you don't
always have to be at minimal fats
what's the next one sometimes
you'll have to add fats into your macro
plan because adding carbs without adding
fats is just unrealistic here's an
example
let's just use the chicken and rice meal
rice technically has some fat in it it's
not a lot but it's a you know
when you're eating like six servings of
rice even though one serving has a gram
of fat that's six grams of fat if you
have 10 gram of fat limit per meal
because you're 40 grams
per day of fats gee you know you're
pretty close to that already
and what about chicken the leanest
chicken breast still has like a gram two
and a half grams of fat here and there
that adds up so even with normal foods
unless that's just chicken and rice
what about like oatmeal and ground
turkey i mean now we're talking about
considerably more fat these are still
super lean super awesome mass gaining
foods just through ancillary fats you
can get to a situation
where you have to add fat like if you
started at 60 grams of fat
right reasonable and you you start at
500 grams of carbs and eventually your
mass gain phase took you to 800 grams of
carbs
500 grams of carbs and 60 grams of fat
means most normal
lean foods are totally appropriate 800
grams of carbs and
just 60 grams of fat means you basically
can't eat chicken and rice all day
because just through chicken and rice
you're already going to get more fats
than 60. right it's really kind of weird
and if you try to eat like salmon or
you know like turkey or oatmeal anything
else
you're going to be way over so instead
of staying at 60 maybe you go to 750
grams of carbs you're still a shitload
and go to 80 grams of fat that still
means you can eat all the same kind of
normal foods
and get everything you need so super
fine adjustment to make there just know
when you're being honest about that not
just an
excuse to eat brownies or something like
that
um if you are gaining in excess
like if you are above the band of gains
and you have to cut calories
that's a great time to lower fats so
let's say you know you're allowing
yourself a good band
and you started at 60 grams of fat at
the beginning of your mass gain phase
and now you're up to 110 grams of fat
which is still low fat if your carbs in
the 5 to 6
700 range but you know you're gaining a
little too fast what are you going to
cut well if you cut carbs and you miss
all those good benefits right
plus you had 110 grams of fat like you
probably cut some fat so maybe you can
cut you know
uh however many calories it is you can
go back to 80 grams of fat from 110 i
mean jesus that's plenty of calories 30
grams of fat you know
uh that's like you know what so three
times nine 270 calories or something
like that
that's pretty solid uh that's a good cut
that might be exactly your five percent
that you need
and what you did is you went from 110
fats to 80 fats and uh you cleaned up
your diet so to speak
and now your ratio of carbs to fats is
even better from sort of an ideal
perspective you still have all those
carbs for that bad ass training energy
so you make the cut it's not like oh man
like i was i knew it was gaining too
quick but my training was going great
your training is still going to go
amazing because you still have all those
carbs there and certainly enough
calories are still hypercaloric
so a good time to cut fats is when
you're gaining a little too fast and
you'll be like ah let's ease up
maybe ease up on the cheat foods let's
ease up on the added fats
you lower those values your calories are
back more in line and everything goes
super well
that's it for adjusting macros and
calories next time adjusting food
composition and supplements
depending on how our bodies respond
during muscle gain see you then
you
