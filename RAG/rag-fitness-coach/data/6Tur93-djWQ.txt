this week holy fuck
[Applause]
what's up guys
it's me dr mike
i'm all alone here my friends decided
not to join me oh wait
it's jared feather and charlie young
it's team full rom in the house we have
today's video for you which is leg
training i'm two weeks out of a
bodybuilding show charlie's three weeks
out jared's three years out because he's
moving up
from classic into the open holy crap
watch out this video
is going to be leg training it's our
monday session this is the first video
of six videos we're going to be doing
every single training day as a video and
interviews a little bit of insight onto
how we feel about the process training
diet motivation psychology etc
please tag in tune along if you have
questions
throw them in the comments if you really
have detailed questions and want us to
look over your training give your video
feedback come and join team full rom on
facebook we're doing it big folks let's
get started with like training see ya
bro there's dog hair in this gym
you're white trash you grew up around
here
who's jim
here's what's on deck as the kids say
hack squats to begin with
then we have some lightweight lunges
right after hacks are over to push a bit
more metabolite and
it's a quad end glute exercise at that
point your quads are so pre-exhausted
there are a lot of times a little factor
after hacks
and then we have leg curls lying leg
curls and then some calf raises after
so right now we start hack squats and
for me i'm personally doing top set 15
and then 13 and then 11 and then
probably like 10 reps that's planned
it's just one rep more than last time
for this entire mesocycle leading up to
the show just adding a rep no load to
not expose my tissues to greater forces
because at this state of show prep it's
a little bit
more injurious than i'd like to trade
off but with adding reps you still get a
bigger stimulus
so that's what i'm doing i'm doing slow
controlled eccentrics and full deep long
pauses to further reduce my injury now
here's the thing here's where stimulus
fatigue ratio comes in not everyone
responds best to that charlie is doing
slightly faster eccentrics because super
slow has actually hurt his knees he's
taken a slightly more gentle pause
because deeper pause hurts his knees
more jared has a zone in idiosyncrasies
so at the end of the day you have to do
what's best for you just make sure the
muscle is getting stimulated and the
joints are getting hurt as little as
possible and you're probably well in
your way let's get the work done
[Applause]
so much
yes
uh
hey folks welcome to episode 1 of our
pre-contest training series
of course we're training legs today and
we also have a bit of a conversation
all these convos in these next few
episodes are going to be about
competing in bodybuilding today's
conversation is going to be
what really are the big differences
between
just training and dieting for yourself
to get really lean even super super lean
even stagely
and what is the difference between that
and actually prepping for a show charlie
give us a give us a start because you've
done some fat loss faces before just to
get lean
and you've recently started competing
you're prep number two for your career
the timeline the show has a very
specific
date that you have to come and show up
for
uh and be in that condition you want to
be in
uh
luckily for a fat loss phase
um you know i wouldn't say completely
arbitrary that you could have a vacation
coming up or something exactly if you
only have like a
certain leanness target even if it's
choline
um you don't necessarily have to make it
by specific dates
but a show you know it's then or not you
know it's now or never you have
much less leeway in terms of
how your diet goes fat loss phase where
you don't have a you know a certain date
that's fine you just get back on and you
know still reach your target but for
a show
if you you know go off plan and you
want to still get to that leanness you
have to be you have to make it up
somehow the bodybuilding show you got a
peak and not just in your own time
but on the show line show timeline and
that means at 11 am or well it's say 11
but really it's 2 pm
you've got to be as lean as you can be
and as full as you can be in as dry as
you can be and that means the last week
and maybe even a few weeks you have to
attend to those things
yeah that's a good point i was gonna
basically touch on the pressure that it
comes with competition
and how often people
generally beat themselves up so this is
a difference that shouldn't be a
difference it just happens to be
especially when people are highly
competitive there's a lot of like
beating yourself up and
and feeling like you're not going to
make it to your goal things like that if
you're just getting lean to get lean i
mean like you said it's so simple to
like
yeah i can macro track today and be fine
uh a lot of people even when you're show
prepping you could probably do that but
whenever you start to do that you're
kind of like a little more neurotic
about it like oh no i can't i can't have
these foods
so it's it's definitely
this weird psychological pressure that
people put on themselves
that they should try to stray away from
but
just caveat to all this i don't
think getting so lean
just to get charlene is smart
i'm just gonna put that out there i
don't i don't understand it photo shoot
i'm just going to say a photo shoot
stands for competition as well if you're
getting photo shoot lean competition
lean whatever it is for some specific
goal
that's the only time you should dip into
those body fats otherwise what the hell
are you doing
getting choline just to see if you can
with no competition in sight is kind of
strange to me um so
maybe don't do that a lot if you're
gonna do it don't do it a lot
try to make progress and enjoy the
results enjoy the dieting process enjoy
the process of training and stuff and
just have fun
[Music]
hack squats are done
right after hack squats no rest
i just did a set of lunges
so did charlie
the idea is while the metabolites are in
the muscle
you continue to push the muscle with
lighter loads
you stay close to failure longer and
being close to failure probably causes a
lot of hypertrophy
this way we can have a really good
stimulus without a ton of fatigue
because the overall load from lunges can
be very low
so i only lunge with the bar
charlie i used to do lunges its own free
exercise we were doing 200 plus pounds
and i looked pretty unstable so a little
bit more injurious
two sets of lunges
and uh you know once that right after
another so maybe a minute two later
they can never keep me down i'm going
and if i ever fail the snow i'll go
again i never quit cause i know that
every loss may lead to another win i'm
going up
i bet when i land they don't tell me
it's luck again see that i'm winning
it's harder to watch i'm setting the
stage you should give me my prize you
ain't gonna saw you lacking the spirit
you talk about your neck i'm gonna show
you i'm with it i've been really helping
you to sit and watch me win again and
win again win again i know it's probably
getting on me and when i'm sending them
so if i ever win again there's no i did
the minimum i didn't have to say myself
[Music]
[Music]
charlie say something nice about mr
chris duffin while you're in there
fuck you guys
[Music]
there you go big chest
oh yeah
24
hop up
25
chris
26 is barcelona
comfortable
27.
so
uncomfortable
28.
everyone should go
i'm buying this 29
thank you jerry
i take it all back
fuck you chris
that was a quick evolution
lunges are done
leg curl time
four sets of leg curls
i'm going to do 20 reps on each set
which means the first one is going to be
like one from failure
of course the others how the hell am i
supposed to hit 20 if i'm fatigued well
i can't but do it through my reps
resting two or three seconds
maybe four or five seconds between each
mini set you add up all the mini sets
and get to 20 each time
so it's basically 80 total repetitions
with maybe like
10 or more approaches to failure the
whole time
brutal great way to do isolation
exercises but typically you'd have to do
a lot of sets and rest a ton this way
you can get them done faster probably
just as effectively if not more so
because you can really sequence your
metabolites
we're going to do leg curls then we'll
finish up with calf raises
let's get it done
just watch you hamstring curl all day
mike
[Music]
when i did my first show
i treated it more as i'm just going to
try to get really lean
and
i didn't treat it as much as a contest
prep
and i
made all sorts of mistakes i looked
terrible
and i had gotten pretty lean before and
posted pictures and the response was
super positive
and when i put myself on stage out of
shape
the response was insanely negative
and i was like oh i just wasn't really
ready for that because there's this idea
that other people hold that if you
step on stage you have to be worthy of
the stage
and there's something to that there's
definitely something to that and even if
there's nothing to that
in the real objective world there is
something to that in people's heads and
when you believe that like competing
themselves
yes especially at a high level
yes people will think people expect you
to be at least as good if not better and
especially now being in the
we're pretty prevalent in the
hypertrophy realm yes the contest prep
realm and things like that it's like
good luck you sure everyone stays out of
shape for sure
how do you decide
if you are ready to take a crack at the
stage my first my first is objective
psychological measures always
every single time which one like when
you dieted down and you got really lean
like you said um what was your
relationship with food like were you
stressed day to day what would like how
stressed were you on a scale of one to
ten with what you're like with food each
and every day
how strict was the diet things like that
so it's like
were you having like bad thoughts about
your physique were you having bad
thoughts about like
people around you did you handle it very
well did you handle the deficit well um
there's just like
you're not ready if you
could dieted down to eight percent
and
all you could think about was food
you were constantly judging yourself in
the mirror you stopped enjoying the
process
um and
like all the things that come with
getting lean really really affected your
mood like no libido
being hungry sometimes sleep gets goes
to shit irritable and nasty to other
people a little nasty to other people to
yourself those things are just
you gotta learn how to handle those a
little bit before you go into the real
like the trenches of contest prep or it
just kind of gets worse light curls are
done so we went on hack squats lunges
leg curls
what would legs be without
as my jewish people say
caves
boy my caves
so calves
we're going to be doing
calves on the belt squat you guys will
see the setup in a sec
sometimes we do my reps sometimes
straight sets
i'll be doing my reps and uh it's good
stuff just make sure keep your leg
straight almost completely straight get
a deep stretch every single time
pee contraction deep stretch milk it if
you don't get a deep stretch in the calf
you're robbing yourself of much of the
growth
so
tend
to think that most people respond to
relatively high reps while on the calves
at least on the first set or otherwise a
load that's lighter than 75 percent of
your calf 1rm which is an important
number to know but uh yeah sets of you
know 15 to 25 on a first set usually
rest maybe 10 seconds 15 seconds hit it
again again again your reps drop all the
way down to like five call it quits of
course mind your volume landmarks you
already have a huge pump and your calves
are super weak time to call it uh
another thing about calves is we train
quads and hams twice a week generally
calves a lot of times we train
three sometimes even four times a week
if they're ready to recover it's all on
you based on how much volume you can put
in how much late onset soreness you have
or how your performance peaks
calf training cannot be done by most
people once a week unless you have gear
or feather genetics you just have them
all times a week because they tend to
heal really fast let's get these calves
done we'll do the outro and call it
quits
[Music]
[Music]
fuck
[Music]
i know
just
a lot of lactic acid
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
folks
workout number one of the week in the
books
legs
the rest of the day we do cardio rest
eat
do work
come back tomorrow
it's gonna be back
in the am
with some farms and the pm
shoulders and biceps how you guys
feeling
a little too fatigued that worked out a
little too fatigued yeah that was a lot
i think it was a little i'll be very
much
by the end of this week yeah
yeah
and that's what good athletes are on
fear and pessimism we'll see you guys
next time
[Music]
