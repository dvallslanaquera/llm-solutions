hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization answering the
age-old question of how much protein you
can process and use for muscle growth
from any one meal at a time and
love of god i hope this is the last time
we have to talk about this
this is already a solved problem but
according to our comments
you lovely fine folks not you
specifically watching this video other
people uh continue to ask us
so here we go
painful as this may be to regurgitate
things that have been known for fucking
generation in any case
two methods by which we can ascertain
how much protein you should be consuming
in a meal specifically what's the
maximum amount of protein you can
consume in a meal and still use towards
muscle growth so here's the first method
you examine the literature around daily
protein intake and you realize that
roughly a gram per pound
per day
is the top end most humans can anabolize
net balance use for muscle growth or
prevent muscle wasting fine
and then you look at the meal frequency
literature and you try to figure out
what is the smallest number or the
lowest number of meals i can have per
day
and still maximize daily muscle growth
and the answer to that is
four meals per day because three meals a
day comes close to maximizing
maximizing anabolism but not quite four
meals per day seems to maximize it and
five six and seven meals though in some
contexts could be better generally on
average don't seem to demonstrate a
repeatable reliable increase in muscle
growth versus just four evenly spaced
high protein meals per day so we have
this gram per pound we have this four
meals per day we divide one into the
other and we find out that at various
body weights how many grams can you have
of protein in a meal to maximize
anabolism and we do the translation and
for a roughly hundred pound male
for females that's similar just a little
smaller tend to have a little bit more
body fat less muscle mass
25 grams per meal for a hundred pound
male 150 pound male 37.5 grams 50 grams
for 200 pound male 250 pound male 62.5
grams or relatively lean if you're
higher on the body fat end you can
constrict those numbers to using uh
something like your what you would be at
10 body fat lean body mass wise so
if you're 150 pounds that means roughly
40 grams of protein per meal is anything
up to that point you can use to
constructively eat more and more to add
muscle as if you eating let's say 50
grams of protein per meal
40 of that could potentially go towards
processes that support muscle growth the
remaining 10 isn't bad for anything like
that it doesn't cost you muscle doesn't
cost you health it just will go to like
energy or some other processes that
don't support muscle growth so if you're
saying hey man i got to get protein at
this meal and someone's like how much
protein let me make you a sandwich if
you weigh 150 pounds you'd be like 40
grams and that's all you got to say you
can say higher if you just want more
protein for the taste and you can say
lower because we don't have to eat this
much we'll get to that just a bit but if
you want to maximize and for sure get as
much protein as your body can handle for
muscle growth 40 grams ish is probably
pretty good all right that's method one
method two
is you examine directly through various
kinds of measurement muscle protein
synthesis and muscle protein breakdown
and that occurs in the protein feeding
literature which is pretty expansive and
the result from there is tended to be
something like 25 grams of protein per
meal tops out and maximizes your ability
to add muscle however there are some
serious limitations to that research
that those researchers to their credit
usually recognize for example
it's usually just one meal at a time so
it doesn't let you get up on
understanding of what if it's multiple
meals in a row and it doesn't count for
refractory periods or if you eat a lot
of protein there's a refractory period
if you eat a little you're actually more
sensitive to more protein after there's
compensatory effects where if you eat a
little bit of protein in a meal if you
eat the next meal if you have more
protein you actually do
gain some more muscle than if you had
had more protein in the meal before
those aren't really accounted for so
some of the estimates are for for that
reason off
another thing is
a huge vast majority of these studies
are done with a very high quality fast
digesting whey protein presented usually
by itself in the form of a shake the
thing is whey protein spikes in your
bloodstream really really fast
and that 25 grams hits an upper limit of
how much amino acids your cells can
absorb and anabolize if you take that
protein and you added in carbs and fats
and maybe made the protein itself slower
digesting it would be exposed to your
blood for longer but
that way it wouldn't hit that cap of how
much cellular transport and metabolism
can occur
and a higher protein amount would hit
that cap
so if you're eating 25 grams of protein
in a burrito that has a 100 grams of fat
or say 60 grams of fat 100 grams of
carbs
then you know you may eat a burrito like
that once every seven hours and then 25
grams of protein in seven hours even
though it's per meal that's not going to
cut it that's not going to maximize
anabolism
there you may be able to have a burrito
with 80 or 100 grams of protein
but it's similar exposure wise in any
hour window the same amount of serum
blood serum amino acid exposure as would
occur from presenting a whey dose every
hour at 25 grams right so huge
limitation there and that's when people
say per meal
if you don't read the studies directly
you should read the abstract you're not
really learning a whole lot if you read
the studies you go oh per whey protein
feeding with nothing else around it also
most of these aren't post-workout so
post-workout you're generally somewhat
more sensitive to protein accretion and
not just for about six hours after
you're more sensitive but if you work
out regularly throughout the week and
you're resistance trained then you're
always more sensitive so people who lift
weights chronically
they can anabolize more than this 25
gram figure and a lot of these studies
are on completely untrained people and
they're also normal sized roughly 150 to
165 pounds in many of these studies so
if you're a 190 pound
person who's pregnant pretty you train
all the time and you're eating what we
call mixed meals proteins carbs and fats
not just proteins by themselves
you know 25 grams of protein per meal is
not a rule that at any one of these
delineations applies to you it's more
it's much more so luckily for us
brad schoenfeld and alan aragon pillars
of research in this field
accounted for all of these things and
derive a research-based uh meta-analysis
or comprehensive review formula
for how much protein is likely per meal
actual meal spread over four times a day
uh
to maximize your ability to gain muscle
and they arrive at 0.55 grams of protein
per kilogram of body weight and that
means if you're a hundred pound male
their estimate is 27 grams of protein
maximizes synthesis
if you're 150 pound male 37 grams 200
pound male 50 grams 250 pound male 4
meals a day for all this by the way is
62 grams of protein
if you look back at method one
holy shit it's almost the same numbers
weird
not weird because that's how the shit
works now if you have one method
completely different and another method
that align to almost the same thing the
probability that you're dealing with the
truth escalates greatly which is cool so
now we know a lot of really good stuff
now
take home points about this
what about
minima
there's a lot to say there's tons of
nuance here and i'll spare you maybe
we'll do another video fucking never
about this just kidding if you guys want
another video put it in the comments
about what's the minimum amount of
protein get away with per meal per day
we'll make a video about that for sure
but in my estimate it's maybe about half
of the numbers that are maximum
lots of nuance here we'll get to some of
it in just a second but for a hundred
pound male
above 11 grams of protein per meal for a
typical meal that's one of the four
meals per day for 150 pound male 17
grams 200 pound male 23 grams 250 pound
male 28 grams now just for reference a
cup of skim milk actually any kind of
milk has roughly eight grams of protein
so if you just have a cup of milk and
you're like hey i got my protein like in
those stupid fucking commercials for
like oh like your daily protein blah
blah like for regular people that it's
not enough
for a meal for basically anyone between
100 and 250 pounds so
almost by definition here if you want to
get more jacked
any more jacked than just eating like a
normal person
you can't eat like a normal person like
a regular sandwich with one slice of
turkey it's not gonna fucking work it's
even at minimum levels it's a more
substantial amount of protein than just
normal people eat
however
if you eat too little in one meal
if you eat more in the next meal there
is some pretty decent literature that
you can
make up the muscle growth not completely
but mostly
if you eat a bit more protein in the
meal after so that's totally a thing so
if you're like you're a road trip or
something or you had like class a
lecture went too long and you were only
able to have like a granola bar and
you're like god damn it fuck i fucking
lost muscle or i didn't grow muscle in
this four hour meal window oh i'm so
pissed that's okay go get a burrito put
double meat in that shit extra cheese
and you'll get most most probably not
all of the muscle growth that you were
getting so yeah be prepared have protein
bars do whatever it takes but
whatever it takes right who said that
rich piana
you can make up for it to some extent
meal to meal to meal generally you don't
want to do that all the meals should be
good high protein but if you fuck up
that's okay
what about too little in one day
the compensatory effect probably doesn't
last that long it probably does a little
bit but not much
i wouldn't go a whole day eating low
protein and look if it happens fucking
who gives a shit in the grand scheme
you're going to gain all the muscle
you're supposed to get anyway through
many more
days and months
and years of dedication for sure i
skipped weeks uh
but
i just wouldn't do that too often the
dedicated lifter make sure to get enough
protein through the day plain and simple
meal to meal to meal and at the very
least day to day today so if you have a
day where you eat 50 grams total protein
per day
you
probably didn't grow any muscle that day
you probably didn't lose a whole lot but
you keep doing that nothing good is
going to happen and like
if you eat 250 grams of protein per day
let's say you weigh 250 pounds if you
eat 50 on one day should you eat like
fucking 500 or something like that 550
to make up for the next day or some shit
probably not just go back to the normal
maybe a little bit higher 300 350 that
next day and then your your golden the
rest is a wash
all right
final words here
those maximum caps so let's say what
were they 200-pound male 50 grams of
protein roughly per meal if it's four
meals a day
what happens if you eat 60 grams of
protein or 75 in one meal
any more protein than that maximum cap
is totally fine it just won't grow any
more muscle than eating 50. so for
example you go to chipotle and you
calculate that like with all the shit
you're putting your burrito with like
one scoop of chicken or whatever it
comes out to 50 grams of protein and
you're like oh should i do double meat
and you're like a little low on cash
fuck that because you're gonna get fine
double scoop you're gonna get 65 grams
of protein but if you max synthesis at
50
you're just like entertaining yourself
with more protein it's just going to
taste like more chickeny or whatever
cool but if you're strapped for cash and
you really care about growth you don't
have to do that great news right
where does that protein grow well if it
doesn't go to growth it goes to support
a trillion other body processes all of
which require protein like fucking take
care of your brain and all this other
shit and also just gets burned for
energy right so no big deal protein
in excess calories by shifting other
macronutrients around if you eat a ton
of excess protein it will make you
fatter but it's of all the three
macronutrients it's the least adipogenic
so the thing that's more likely to make
you fat if you eat in excess is fat
surprise uh the next is carbs and then
the next biological is protein so eating
a little bit too much protein is not the
worst thing in the world and certainly
has no concern for healthy people as far
as health if you have kidney problems
yeah fuck yeah you got to talk to your
doctor and make sure you don't do stupid
shit that he says is not a good idea or
she says not a good idea but generally
speaking
too much protein is not really a thing
so if you eat like 300 grams of protein
per day you're supposed to have 200 if
someone's like dude what fuck are you
doing like it's no big deal it's totally
fine
what is not great is if you have instead
of 300 grams of protein when you're
supposed to be having 200 you know like
four or 500 grams that's not the bad
part the bad part is in order to keep
your calories constrained to whatever it
is they're supposed to be let's say
you're doing a good job of that 3000
calories or whatever
you ramp up the protein you got to ramp
down the fats and down the carbs you
ramp down the carbs you ramp up the
pumps and the energy you bring to
training and the anabolic process these
carbs support so if you're doing low
carb high protein you won't gain any
more muscle than if you just do that 200
grams of protein whatever you're
supposed to have gram per pound and then
layer and carbs on top of that if you
cut your fats too low you can interfere
with hormonal shit sex drive training
energy nothing you want so
keep your fats above minimum levels keep
your carbs to as many carbs as you can
stuff in while meeting your protein
needs so it's basically meet your
protein needs meet your fat needs
the rest can come from a combination of
carbs and fats and proteins but
generally speaking
and i don't want to put too fine a point
on this the more carbs the better in
most cases not all but in most cases
right so
how do you construct a meal plan from
this well if you want to get jacked
let's say you're eating four meals a day
you weigh 200 pounds each meal is gonna
have roughly 50 grams of protein and
then each meal on top of that has some
fraction of your daily fats some
fractionated daily carbs
voila you're good to go and you're
getting jacked folks let me know if you
want any more insight on anything if you
want to dispute anything if you want to
follow up anything and we'll try to get
uh maybe some videos going on that
