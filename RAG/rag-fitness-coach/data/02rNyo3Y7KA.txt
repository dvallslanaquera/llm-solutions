hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and I have a message if
you want to be as lean as possible you
should only do your cardio when you're
fasted
wait no that's wrong it's actually BS
lucky
take a quick look into why
the rationale for faster cardio in a
certain sense actually makes a lot of
sense
so let's cut it some slack
if you wake up you have some black
coffee or whatever and you go do cardio
there's nothing in your stomach there's
nothing in your bloodstream from your
gastrointestinal tract you're burning a
lot of just straight body fat to get
that done totally If instead
you ate food you would be burning some
of your body fat stores but also you'd
be burning a lot of the food that you
just ate especially towards the tail end
of that cardio when the food starts to
really Digest and some people eat
breakfast do whatever work and then an
hour or two later they'll like go do
cardio well yeah it's a lot of like food
you're burning and why would you burn
food if you could just burn body fat
instead so fasted cardiologic seems to
make sense
but
direct research shows that there's a
teeny tiny difference and we don't even
know which way it goes usually it favors
fasted cardio by like some
infinitesimally small
uh
barely statistically detectable
difference so it turns out fed State
cardio where you eat a meal wait a while
they go to cardio that in the real world
versus fasted cardio causes almost the
same amount of fat loss what
like uh how how could that possibly be
if we're burning food in one for the
most part and burning body fat in the
other for the most part
well here's the thing
if you eat some food and you burn up
some of it during cardio that's food
that's not available in your bloodstream
to get stored into fat stores
that's food that's not available in the
bloodstream to power energy for daily
tasks later so where are you going to
get that energy is your fat cells so it
turns out that as long as the calories
between those two conditions of fed
State cardio and fasted cardio are
equated it's 2 000 calories 500 calorie
deficit in each one of those you really
end up over the course of the day
burning roughly the same amount of body
fat whether or not it's fasted or fat
to that end
how do you decide if you want to do
fasted cardio or fed State cardio and
there's really an easy decision-making
process
how hungry are you versus how much
energy do you need to do cardio
if you notice that hunger is a big deal
it might be a good idea for you to try
fasted cardio here's why
you wake up you do whatever you go start
doing cardio without having eaten yet
cardio takes an hour you finish your
cardio you shower whatever then you eat
during cardio for sure and even after
cardio for 30 minutes or whatever you're
often just not hungry because you're in
a sympathetic state of activity and
you're not really like very much hungry
at the time
so you certainly you kind of bought
yourself a hour or two or three if you
stretch it out of non-hunger time
that means all of the rest of the
calories you have spread to eat through
the day can crunch together
and then you're eating in any unit time
for the day later
more calories per unit time because at
same calories but the unit time has
shrunk normally you would eat 2 000
calories over 16 hours and kind of be
really hungry during that time but you
bought yourself two extra hours of doing
cardio and then showering when you're
not eating
so now it's 14 hours
same number of calories divided by 14
hours you're feeling Fuller on average
so it's a great way to manage your
hunger and that's the big Power of
fasted cardio
but if your hunger is not really an
issue and your cardio is really
suffering energy wise
fed State cardio is just way easier
because you have energy from food for
your brain glucose stuff like that so if
you eat a meal do some chores do some
work two hours later you do cardio
you're going to burn over the course of
24 hours almost the same identical
amount of fat
but at the same time you're going to be
able to really power through that cardio
so if you need cardio power
fed State cardio is better
especially if you do higher intensity
cardio if you compete in some kind of
sport that requires you to train train
if you can plot through your cardio no
problem a little bit of black coffee
goes a long way and you really want to
hunger manage by squeezing the remainder
of your food into a smaller eating
interval then faster cardio is your
choice so the idea that fasted cardio is
always superior to Fed State cardio for
fat loss is and they hate it
stop it
thanks Arnold it's great to hear your
voice again and until next time see you
next time
