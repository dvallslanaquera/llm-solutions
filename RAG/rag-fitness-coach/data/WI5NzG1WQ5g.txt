we are going to pump

today
they're going to go and get huge folks
dr mike jared feather and it's nick best
that's right nick best he has so many
qualifications that i have to read them
off of instagram because they're too
many to remember at the same time he is
on history channel's strongest man in
history tv show he's on a real tv show
for real for real not youtube for real
jared and i aren't tv actors this man is
famous i'm going to have him sign my
face in a second
10 times yeah yeah not with repentance
i've lost anyway broke my concentration
10 times world's strongest man
competitor
numerous time world's strongest man
finalist the masters world's strongest
man world power lifting champion there's
a whole lot more here this guy has seen
it all done it all
beaten the odds and he's here because he
saw us doing super high volume full
range of motion like training and he
literally locked up to us he was like
hey i'm curious about this can i do it
we're like are you nuts and he's like
well yeah sure and now he's here high
volume quad workout any final words
uh yeah it should be fun it's it's
the deep burns gonna be really
interesting and
it's just gonna be fun to throw it
because everything i do is like
belligerently heavy and kind of like not
very high reps except for like when i
pull deadlifts for reps but for the most
part this would be a good change of pace
for the day
good change of pace and with that we
take you to our first exercise
[Music]
what's that yeah that's perfect
see this
still can't quite reach my shoes yet
it's embarrassing but what do you do my
career is a very good job
hey folks so exercise number one is the
hack squat this is going to be for sets
of 10 to 20 reps probably a bit on the
higher end to keep this nice and safe
really good cadence slow on the way down
full stop for a quick second at the
bottom coming up in an athletic manner
maya reps of course multiple attempts
close to failure within a single set
resting at the top with a not racking
but letting the knees lock a little bit
taking a couple of breaths we're going
to take a couple runs at that that's
called my reps we do it all the time
this is gonna hurt a lot we'll probably
do around three sets we'll see how nick
feels
let's see how that world's strongest man
endurance holds up i'm old so i don't
feel good so one set no
it's instant i'm old excuse just up

nick best is doing five plates per side
on the hack squat
for like sets of 15 to 20 total reps
motherfuckers out here doing eight nine
ten plates you were not at world's
strongest man at any time you do not
have the squat world record this guy
just squatted 815 pounds
like a few weeks ago at a powerlifting
meet and you didn't do that shit you're
not that strong you're just using shitty
technique poor foot placement your boys
are pushing the shit for you you got
eight bands one around your dick one
around your head cut that shit out use
the weight you can use to hit your quads
with good technique and you won't have
to take other people's plates off their
bars that's it yeah
don't put it around your junk though
that's a really bad idea it's a fine
idea if you like paint
it's vegas
i wouldn't recommend that

stars
[Music]
you take your time your rest all you
need we're gonna go set up your next bar
for you okay
sorry
so i'm still trying to breathe yeah
please take your time
hack squats are done three sets
maya reps add up to 10 to 20 reps per
set about 15 on average
nick is destroyed quad wise which is
awesome because the next exercise is
squats with the amazing kabuki strength
chris duffin transformer bar this is
literally the ultimate squat bar and
good morning bar it has a ton of
settings for different positions you can
do replicate a low bar a high bar a
goblet squat or sorry a front squat and
then a goblet squat all in the same bar
by moving a super easy clip and then you
can move the bar individually up and
down the rungs too
they can take a weight like 225 for a
literal world's strongest man competitor
and turn it into sets of five to ten now
a lot of that's a hat squad fucked him
well up beforehand but also the
transformer bar can take a small amount
of weight and leverage it crazy so that
your body gets this insane workout you
don't have to slap plate after plate
after plate on the bar highly recommend
you check that out if you are friendly
with whoever owns your gym you come up
to him you shake and you say please buy
a transformer bar for the love of god
anyway
nick is up he has three sets
of squats five to ten rep range super
slow the way down pause at the bottom
and after that don't tell him we have a
little bit of a drop set situation all
the way down to bodyweight squats let's
see if he lives
turn that world's strongest man shit on
