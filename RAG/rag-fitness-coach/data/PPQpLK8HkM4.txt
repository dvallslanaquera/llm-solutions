a study by mannarino and colleagues
recruited 10 previously untrained men
and had them trained unilateral dumbo
supinated rose with one arm and
unilateral dumbbell supinated curls with
the other arm
subjects trained both arms for four to
six sets of eight to twelve repetitions
twice per week for eight weeks
before and after the study
thickness of the elbow flexors including
the biceps and brachialis muscles was
measured at 25
50 percent and 75 of the biceps length
the following results average out of
these three regions to obtain a single
value
it was found that the dumbbell curls
produce much greater elbow flexor
thickness gains compared to the dumbbell
rows
