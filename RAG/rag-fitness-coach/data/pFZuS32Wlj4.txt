hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's tip
is a technique alteration
to give your triceps an altercation
[Laughter]
do you have any idea how hard it is to
find out clever not funny things to say
in the youtube channel i spent all last
night awake thinking what am i gonna say
so the viewers love me
clearly i thought of nothing good so
here's the deal real talk
there are many many ways to do dips but
there are a set of ways to do dips that
are better for actually hitting the
triceps
than others but what are the other ways
doing well some ways can hit the chest
more which is totally fine no wrong
answers but if you're doing the dips for
triceps you probably want to do them
this way
and other ways of doing dips just let
you do a lot of reps and or weight which
again is a metric of how good our dips
are going but isn't the goal
there's no
um nobody ever gives a fuck how much you
can dip you imagine being like a fucking
checkout line or grocery store and
someone's like woody bench like i don't
know but i can dip with 67 pounds for
three reps
blow parallel on
my belt on my body and i weigh i weigh
uh 57 kilos they're like what the fuck
just scan your credit card and get out
of here idiot nobody cares
so usually we do dips
in order to get stronger on them
or in order to build muscle and if
building muscle is your goal and try
substitute target here's how you can do
dips in a way that is slightly better
and will get you better results here we
go first
don't tuck your feet behind you get your
feet to
fall straight and actually point your
toes forward a little bit so if you look
down when you're on the dip stand push
your toes forward a little bit what that
will do is it will change your body
alignment and center of gravity a little
bit to make you more vertical
because if you lean forward during dips
it's more chest if you stay upright
during dips it's more triceps so by
pushing your feet forward instead of
tucking them back if you tuck them back
you tilt this way and all of a sudden
you're doing more chest oriented dips
you don't want that so stay upright and
let your feet fall down completely
straightforward
as you descend try to physically stay
more upright don't lean your chest in as
much as you'd want stay as upright as
you can you will notice that there will
be a temptation to do something which is
also the correct thing
if you're trying to stay upright but
you're trying to bend your elbows what
that's going to do
is is it's going to make your elbows go
back this way
as opposed to holding the attachment or
holding the dip station
your elbows remain stationary and your
shoulder comes forward that's a lot of
pack a lot of front delt
this way you're holding the attachment
this stays relatively steady and
your elbow goes back
it looks like damn that guy is making
dips really hard on himself which is
exactly the point of the fucking
exercise if the target is tricep yes if
you split the load evenly between packs
and triceps that will get you to dip
more you'll do more reps you lose more
weight
yes if you lean even more forward and
as the shoulders come forward it's even
more pecks your pecs are fucking
stronger than your triceps you can do
even more weight but if you stay upright
lean back let your elbows crack and go
back this way as opposed to leveraging
forward on them
it will make it more difficult but so
much more of that targeting will hit
your triceps
right you will feel that tension go
through your triceps which is a good
thing and i'm telling you this right now
so there's no surprises it will make
dips harder which is to say
whatever body weight you are whatever
reps you could do you will do fewer reps
period
i'm sorry and after you can jump off the
dip stand and be like doctor mike fuck
me fucking lie to me these dips suck i
can only do five of them i used to be
able to do ten
but that's the point it's five dips that
hit your triceps more so with all the
fatigue you got from 10 dips you got a
decent tricep stimulus now you got five
dips and
almost the same tricep stimulus with
half the reps amazing that's what we
want right
that's a good thing
that dips are harder but more specific
because our goal is growth not fuckery
not telling the girl at the club how
many weighted dips you can do at 57
kilos body weight
next you want to go all the way down
until your forearm touches your bicep
this is bullshit this is bullshit that's
bullshit i don't know what the fuck that
is that's a way partial dip
if you go super deep
that allows the tricep muscle to
lengthen and when muscles are trained in
their lengthened state when they get a
ton of tension applied to them while
stretching
the research literature seems to confirm
that that just grows more muscle
the downside is that it makes you feel
fucking weak and it's really hard to do
dips down there
and now you instead of doing you know
15 dips you're doing 10 and that blows
but there are 10 fucking awesome dips
that really burn the shandara triceps
which is what we want
lastly this is an option you don't have
to do this but for shoulder safety
and to fuck your triceps up even more
when you get to the bottom
right notice i'm not doing this i'm
doing this
triceps back elbows back
you can rest at the very bottom
your forearm is hitting your bicep
for like one split second one second
pause and then go back up
what's the benefit of that it just has
your triceps under the maximum stretch
and tension for one second longer
there's that really good zone down there
on a deep stretch which is really
hypertrophic it's really growth
promoting
us choosing to stay down there for a
split second extra is like us being in a
really good growth zone and stimulating
a little bit more growth it's awesome
it's not mandatory you can do dips
dynamically
but try doing them this way and you'll
find again like god damn it doctor mike
this is even fucking harder i'm down to
doing almost no dips i used to think i
could do 30 dips now i'm doing 10 but
you're doing them properly and what
you're gonna notice is this
two or three sets into regular dips back
when you're doing sets of 30 you're like
yeah like i feel my triceps
one or two sets of these dips you'll be
like holy fucking shit my triceps are
coming off the bone
which is
perfect perfect perfect
you're gonna have big triceps doing dips
this way
you're going to be walking through the
grocery store
and that really cute cashier lady is
going to be like i don't want to know
what you bench press i just want to know
what your tick tock is so i can slide
into the dms get out those triceps
motherfucker you feel me you're like did
you just say motherfucker comma you feel
me she's like yeah hell yeah i did and
you're like
um see you on tech talk
see you guys on tick tock i also have a
tick tock if you're that sort of thing
it's maybe doctor mike israel or
something
um
[Music]
there i am it's just more of
me doing this
but less informative because it's 30
seconds at a time youtube is a shit i
love you guys
