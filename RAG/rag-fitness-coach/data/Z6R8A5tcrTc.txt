hey folks dr mike here for the targeting
the muscle series today's muscle is
glutes today's exercise is lunges how do
you do your lunges to make sure you're
doing a good job targeting glutes
especially if you're having trouble with
it if your lunges blow up your glutes
skip this video down vote report the
video just kidding please don't do any
of that here's the deal
first tip
here we
go
[Music]
all right step length
how long should you step in order to
target your glutes the most
technically speaking the longer you step
as long as you're still stable and able
to produce a ton of force your glutes
take a larger fraction of that load and
thus stimulus if we think about it
intellectually if we just go down like
this and come up like that that's a
shitload of quads and not a whole lot of
glutes we're staying mostly upright the
glute doesn't have a ton of
sort of distance to translate through
if we go a little bit like this
this is the glute we're targeting here
with this leg yeah we get a little bit
more glute stuff because we're sitting
so much further back which is really
what hits the glutes a ton it's fine but
you can tell there's still a lot of knee
flexion going on relative to hip flexion
and we don't want that because it
targets the quads a lot the glutes not
so much
if we take a really long step
notice how much insane stretch we're
putting on the glutes and then that
allows us to hit the glutes a ton
so a nice slow descent like that with a
really long step allows us to maximize
glute involvement which is a really
awesome thing now i said as long as
you're stable
this is where i get hurt
you don't get bonus points you're trying
to kill yourself in the gym so you're
saying oh long steps huh watch this yeah
see
and you go like one of them
you can barely produce force barely stay
upright that's no bueno so nice long
steps as long as you can make them while
still stable
and strong
that's going to be pretty close to ideal
for the glutes in most cases
[Music]
when you're doing lunges it's important
to realize crazy it may sound that your
legs are the target and you don't want
to do a lot of the lifting with your
back
so staying relatively upright and
especially having a rigid body posture
is a good idea
so if you're going down especially if
you have dumbbells or a barbell which
most the time you do
if you're going down into a lunge and
you're coming down here and you're doing
one of these yes you can lift more
weight into more reps if you start
collapsing like that towards the end
because it takes the load off of your
legs and it creates that extra range of
motion with your back we don't want that
we want to stay in a rigid segment
staying nice and upright with our chest
everything is nice and straight because
we don't want to collapse like this it
takes away the target muscle and
replaces it with the back so staying
nice and upright
nice and upright can really require your
legs to work like crazy and demand
everything out of them they are after
all the target now
can you lean forward a little bit
in a controlled manner to stretch your
glutes more
yes and there's not a damn thing wrong
with that so you don't have to
necessarily go like this and stay super
upright what you can do is you can lean
forward into the movement a little but
notice i'm leaning for my hips which
stretches my glute i'm not leaning like
this
that's the ticket rigid upper body some
lean is okay
but make sure you're not rounding that's
not glutes anymore that's just ego kids
you know what we say about ego
i got nothing there's no joke
[Music]
oh
which leg in lunges
should hold most of your weight should
it be 50 50 should it not
it turns out it's likely that most of
the hypertrophic effect for your glutes
daddy
comes from
that stretched position and generating
tension out of that stretch it probably
doesn't come from the back leg in that
contracted position nearly as much
so
when we think about if we have to bias
either we do 50 50 weight normally
distributed through both legs that's
totally cool or what we can do is bias a
little bit more of the load into that
front leg that sh taxes a crapload of
glutes in that stretched position it
makes us really have to work with our
glutes to get up
so what i don't want you to do is to put
a lot of weight on the back leg it's
either 50 50 or lots of the weight is on
the front leg the front leg is what
pushes out the back leg just acts kind
of as a support
[Music]
should you use
a barbell on your back
or dumbbells in your hands here's the
deal if you're struggling with balance
or if you have a new client you're
training they're struggling with balance
the barbell shifts kind of like a tight
rope walk i wouldn't put a bar on
someone's back
if they're also not super strong and
they tend to be wobbly if something
happens they can always drop the
dumbbells and they're cool but if
something that happens in the barbell on
your back
you're doing some time in injury jail
however so if you're not super strong if
you're new to lunges or someone you're
working with is and if they're wobbly
dumbbells can act kind of as a really
good stabilizing mechanism and as you go
down it's really safe if something
happens you can just drop them no big
deal
if you're more experienced
if your balance is not a limiting factor
and
if you're so strong in the lunge that
you'd have to grip like 70 pound
dumbbells and then it's just a trap
exercise and you're just trying to grip
it and it's trying to fall you're trying
to target your glutes but there's too
much going on
at that point barbell becomes a better
idea because the barbell you can put a
shitload of weight on your back and only
be focused on the actual movement itself
not having to worry about are my hands
going to slip out of these dumbbells so
barbells
more than often
for the more advanced very stable folks
that are very strong dumbbells for the
folks that are unstable new to the lift
you're worried about them getting hurt
if there's no wrong answers you can use
whatever you want just be aware of that
if you're really having trouble with
hitting loots on lunges and it never
occurred to you like ah fuck it's
because i'm using dumbbells and my grip
is off or oh fuck it's because i'm
trying to use the barbell but i'm always
doing this instead of actually being
able to sit and do the lunge now you
have some answers to help you out
all right last tip
the loading that you use can present
both challenges and solutions to your
glute targeting problem in lunges here's
how that works
with light loads your technique can be
so good
that you have a good mind muscle
connection and connect with your glutes
and everything works well
with heavier lunges especially lunges
for sets of 10 or something you can be
so
enamored and so focused
on actually lifting the weight
that your technique goes into more
optimal for lifting as much as possible
less optimal for hitting the glutes and
all of a sudden you are doing more work
you do more weight but you get less of a
glute connection on the other hand
moderate weight and often on the heavier
range of moderates that's a 15 or so
can actually at the bottom especially
bias you forward a little bit more you
can't do this fake bullshit upright
nonsense and then it actually requires
your front leg to work more and thus
that stretched glute to work more and
you get more glutes that way so what i
would recommend is two things
one
try to train for sets of 15 to 25 reps
for lunges anything much less can be a
little wobbly and thus you're not really
connected to your glutes anything much
more than that can start to be a really
awesome quad workout but because you're
not so focused on keeping the good
mechanics and you're not so focused on
really using your glutes you're just
kind of lunging forward uh it ends up
being more of a quad situation
also in many cases not all i have found
that for higher reps the quad pump and
burn become so intense
that begins to be the limiting factor
and it's now a quad exercise just be
aware of how your technique changes with
loading so before you take lunges and
throw them away and say it's a shitty
glute exercise i only ever feed my quads
experiment with slightly heavier loads
moderate loads and slightly lighter
loads and see which one of those
actually hits your glutes the best
sometimes if you think oh it's all quads
and you go a little heavier you actually
find your glutes get super sore and
super tight and everything is great
again folks that's all the tips i have
for this time see you next time for the
next video
