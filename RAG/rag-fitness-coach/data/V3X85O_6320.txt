slow slow slow slow and one more go
higher I lie all the time for your
benefits slow
[Music]
guys I finally did it
yes I do bodybuild I do Jiu Jitsu I do
RP I do all those things but that only
takes a small fraction of my day I think
I do most
with my time is try to design a time
machine
me in the past baby I brought him back
Dr Mike as a 13 year old what up baby
what's up anyway JK unfortunately time
machine hasn't quite worked stretched me
out because I'm taller back when I was
13 I guess this is Matt
he is 13 years old his parents signed
the waiver good news he's going to be
getting a great workout bad news is he's
gonna be getting a great workout chest
triceps biceps
how you feeling before this all starts
well I'm ready for the pain it's gonna
be brutal have you seen this guy's
forearms like I got a little baby wrist
over here and his forearms are as big as
my biceps so and they won't be helping
you because you got to do all the work
yourself folks
Let's Do It
show me what a push-up looks like and
then we'll fuck with your Technique a
little bit cool
a set of four push-ups but a couple of
rules yeah I want you to bring your
hands in to about right here just
outside shoulder width okay I want you
to keep your butt slightly elevated yes
I want you to touch your chest to the
ground but apply almost no Force into
the ground so your chest is touching put
all of her tensions on your chest and
then come all the way up slow on the way
down
normal speed on the way up perfect give
it a shot yeah
hands about here correct
look forward
slow on the way down
up
oh yeah slow
up
good slow
up and one more slow
and up excellent right 20. relax say
what felt like 20. yeah for sure and
that's just the warm-up
you my dad just me and uh myself from
the past or dad same thing yeah
all right guys here with my son Matt
he's been doing real great at school and
everything I'm really proud of him
we are going to start the chest and
tricep workout with deficit push-ups we
could do bench press and that's all well
and good but showing you guys that there
are tons of different ways to train
chest deficit push-ups are amazing huge
stimulus super safe you can be super
controlled you can do them damn near
anywhere that there is a deficit
available and uh they're really awesome
and fun let's get it done we're probably
gonna do gee whiz you want a good
workout huh I do yeah I want to be a
pain mom
yeah like five sets let's hit it let's
do two reps all right easy still a warm
up yep so go ahead and get your
positioning right slow on the way down
touch your chest to the ground gently
and then come back up look forward
deep yes good slow
and up
good that's it right rest relax
that was very good the only critique is
I want your butt to be a little tiny bit
more like this than like this like
pretend there's a pencil sharpener down
there pointed at your well you know you
know the rest you said butt up more yes
just like that all right look forward
touch your chest to the ground slow and
controlled
stop good lower
[Music]
but higher yes just like that
[Music]
slower on the way down
yeah just like that
up
good two more slow
[Music]
up
great that's it one more rest oh shit
here we go keep that bot up
yeah yeah good stuff
all right
yeah you don't agree with it all is
training every step to failure yeah um
sure just for the fact of enjoyment sure
well you know I'd say you're you're a
13. I would say just train uh as long as
your Technique is good yeah and you're
not like doing way too many sets to
where you can't recover like if you're
someone else is healed by the time you
go back to the gym I think you can go to
failure a bunch like especially when
you're young it's cool you know when
you're over like the age of 2021 and
stuff you're going to start to have to
do reps and reserves that's just yeah
already
I don't know how much time you need
you're 13 you should be snap snap
deeper touch the chest to the ground up
very good slower on the way down
good slow yeah
butt up butt up go
it's gonna make it harder not easier we
are here for heart one more mat
slow
up up up
that's it
ah good stuff set number two in the
books
I won't be Barbara benching for a week
the chest is gonna be your chest is kind
of big I was gonna say oh is it is it
fake is it simple yes like that the
whole time it will not be easy good
slow
yeah these are so good control
top one more man get it together
up up up beautiful rest good very good
rests nice long time and we'll do
something a little different so in the
next set this will be in a little bit
you're gonna do as many push-ups as you
can normal and then as soon as you come
close to failure I want you to switch
from being on your toes to being on your
knees and then doing as many push-ups as
possible basically no rest
exactly yeah I think these are called
mechanical drop sets
beautiful lower I need to see that chest
convincingly touch the ground yeah there
you go
[Music]
good one more slow
one last one
[Music]
up move move knees
right down your knees
oh now the fun starts keep your butt up
still not up still do you want me to
touch the ground like with myself
correct same thing
oh yes good again
[Music]
full lockout good slow
up good again slow
up up up
that's it good stuff
very good
well we've been for two weeks at this
rate yeah for real
all right all right let me show you the
next exercise
[Music]
I don't know if you've done these before
but these are called inverted Skull
Crushers I've not you basically it's
like whatever a skull crusher is to
bench press this is to a push-up okay so
you have open grip so I don't want you
to roll your thumbs around because this
actually seems to be at least for me and
a lot of folks I've trained better for
their elbows if you keep an open grip
like this all right
and
you basically want to take something
like shoulder width maybe a little bit
inside in your case
and put your feet out nice where it's
comfy and then you're just going to bend
your elbows and the only power comes
from triceps okay you go down nice and
low what I want you to do is I actually
want you to go put your chin over here
and actually touch your neck to it my
biceps are a little too big for that and
then you come back up just like that so
it's basically a push-up which will only
use your triceps keeping your elbows I
wish I had that problem you will soon
all right Pinky's on the line so let's
try that all right
cool my chest still pumped good it will
continue to be pumped for a long time
look forward
hit it off elbows in yes correct
good head up touch your neck yes good
elbows in
the top Matt these are looking great
keep going
good slow
stuff
good take a break break same place
two more slow
push
one more slow
up up up that's it relax feel your
triceps a little yeah brutal good very
good very good
elbows in
yeah oh that's beautiful again
slow control big push
good again
[Music]
good elbows in
yes
amazing again slow
up good again oh oh man we're in a
rhythm go go go go
free it two more
[Music]
up
good slow you got it
I'll pop up how many is that nice good
keep going slow
press
let's do one more let's do one more
look up
press push away push away push away
that's it relax
yeah oh my God yeah except for you today
your chest is already gone so I know you
can't even yeah we put the bar we give
you the 45 pound bar yeah yeah pretty
much question where should the bar
height be for this it all depends on
your relative strength level and
familiarity with the exercise so if
you're like World's Strongest Man or
something you take the bar and you put
it down to basically like as low as it
goes and then this exercise is very
challenging if you're just starting out
if you're very young uh if you've never
done this exercise before put the bar
higher and it's really all to comfort
and you know where you put it is
basically like where can you get the rep
range that you're targeting this is an
exercise it's like super great exercise
it's kind of universal it works really
well in the five to ten rep range 10 to
20 20 to 30. it's just a great great
exercise if your Technique is good if
you can replicate your Technique it's
phenomenal remember keep those elbows in
slow and controlled
good don't rush it slow on the way down
look up push two more easy
oh yeah again elbows and elbows and
elbows and elbows in all the way up up
up up up up up up up up rest for a sec
rest
one and then another two total
and again look up
press big go go go go go go go
good job that's yeah phenomenal tell me
your triceps are pumped they're pumped
good stuff what's your favorite way to
train your biceps what do you like to
biceps cable curls cable curls yeah we
will do barbell curls today
I should have said Barber girls 13 you
don't need cables back in my day we
didn't even have machines yeah
yo
last exercise of the day the barbell
bicep curl why because like man there's
something magical about the barbell
bicep curl these kids 13 years old gotta
start them off with the basics and uh
you know cable curls are great and to be
honest you should be doing what is best
for stimulus fatigue ratio but barbell
Blaster curl properly executed is an
unbelievable exercise and Matt's gonna
do a great job technique is always a
thing if you're swinging get out of here
if you're doing any of this kind of
shrugging get out of here all biceps
nice big Arc range motion and here's the
thing getting the bar up great half the
movement
slowing it on the way down is a ton of
growth stimulus so you definitely want
to do that part as well and can you curl
in the squat rack if no one else is
waiting for it absolutely and if guys
say and then you can't grill the squat
rack you just give them a look
start your dominoes I gotta try that
good slope control
good no bending the knees
excellent slow good and up go go go go
go go go go go go go go slow rest
breathe for a second
go
up up up up slow slow slow breaths per
sec and then one more good one no
swinging up
go go go go go go go go go
go slow as if you're gonna do another as
if you're gonna do another slow slow
