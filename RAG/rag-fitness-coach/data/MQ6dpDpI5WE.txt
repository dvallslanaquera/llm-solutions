so unlike what most people think this is
actually the largest muscle group on
your upper body in terms of total volume
i also think it's the most important
muscle for giving you that strong
aesthetic look
and those are my top recommended
movements when it comes to building it
what's up guys sean nalawani

the question for today's video is this
do you know what the largest muscle
group on your upper body actually is
because probably
99 out of 100 people or more get this
question wrong
so in this video i'm going to give you
the correct answer and i'll also give
you a few
important tips when it comes to training
this particular muscle for the very best
results
if you're new here don't forget to

videos
and let's jump into it now yes if you
took
all the individual muscles of your back
and you lump them all together
that technically would be the largest
muscle on your upper body but it's
important to understand
that the back itself is not one muscle
and it shouldn't be thought of that way
it's actually a collection of
many different muscles with different
functions we don't call this area the
front
and so treating the back as being one
muscle group that's not accurate either
you've got the lats
the traps the spinal erectors all fairly
large muscles on their own
there's the rhomboids the tears groups
as well but none of these muscles
individually are the largest muscle on
the upper body
so if it's not the back then obviously
it must be the chest right
well no like i've said before most
people in the gym overemphasize the
importance of chest
training not to say that building a big
chest isn't still an important part of
building an impressive physique
obviously it is but a lot of people just
go totally overboard with this and they
perform a disproportionate
amount of volume for their chest
thinking that that's the one big key to
looking jacked when in fact
the chest is not as big of a muscle as
most people think
in reality depending on what source you
look at some studies even rank the
triceps as carrying more total mass
than the pex which is something that
most people would never think so what is
the largest upper body muscle i'm
assuming you've probably guessed it by
now and that is
the deltoids yes the shoulders are on
average the largest muscle group on the
upper body
and i'll reference a great article on
this by meno henselmans who many of you
are probably familiar with
where his research team uh reviewed all
of the relevant studies
looking at the subject of muscle volume
and they found that on average
the delts contained 30 more total muscle
mass than the pecs
35 more mass than the lats traps and
triceps
and they're more than three times bigger
than the biceps which are by far
the smallest major muscle group on your
entire body which is just further
evidence of the fact that
all these fitness youtubers uploading a
million different top-secret biceps
exercises and talking as if it's
some critical muscle group that needs to
be trained from a million different
unique
angles they're really just talking
nonsense and as a side note here the
largest muscle group on
your entire body in general by far is
the quadriceps it's not the glutes like
most people commonly think
but getting back to the point not only
are the delts the biggest upper body
muscle but in my opinion they're also
the most important muscle
for giving your body that strong
muscular look your upper body that is
not only do they make you appear wider
but the more developed they are
the more they're going to create the
appearance of a smaller waistline and
that's going to help to accentuate that
v-tapered look that most guys are after
so it's really just a key area to build
up in terms of
overall physique aesthetics now what are
some practical recommendations that i
would give based on this
well first off unless you're a more
advanced trainee and your chest is a
specific lagging weak point
then we really need to do away with this
whole chest training obsession that so
many lifters have especially
beginners again the shoulders are
objectively a larger muscle group
and they're probably going to have the
largest overall impact on your upper
body appearance especially in
combination with a well-developed upper
back
proper chest training is obviously still
important just like training every
muscle group is
but the point here is to not
unnecessarily over emphasize your chest
and then treat your shoulders as a
secondary muscle or as an afterthought
or to think of them as a small muscle
group like a lot of people do now
in terms of exercise selection what are
the best exercises for building the
shoulders
there are three main exercises that i
would recommend and then two optional
add-ons that you can include
depending on your individual needs so
the first and most obvious one is going
to be a basic
overhead press this will primarily train
the anterior head of the shoulder which
is the front
it'll hit the lateral head to some
extent as well which is the side
especially depending on which overhead
press variation you use
it also involves the upper clavicular
head of the pecs
the triceps the traps as well and this
is basically the
sort of bread and butter staple shoulder
movement that has the largest capacity
for progressive
overload in terms of weight increases
now there are several different options
here you can do a basic
standing overhead barbell press or a
seated overhead dumbbell press
or you could do a seated overhead
barbell press or a standing overhead
dumbbell press any of those are
ultimately acceptable
i've personally always favored the
seated overhead dumbbell press that
always just felt
the smoothest and the most natural for
me but you can test out each variation
and see which one
feels best for you and if your goals are
strictly hypertrophy related okay you're
not trying to
hit some specific overhead pressing
number as a personal goal
then there's also nothing technically
wrong with using cables or machines
if you prefer that for some reason and
then lastly the arnold press is another
variation that you can test out
which involves a bit more lateral head
and allows you to train that overhead
pressing movement
while using less total weight now as
long as you're doing an overhead
pressing variation of some kind in your
program
and you're doing basic pressing
movements for your chest as well like
i'm sure everybody is
that's going to be more than enough to
fully stimulate the front head of your
shoulder in most cases
and so unless for some unlikely reason
you have underdeveloped front delts
there's usually no need to include front
raises in your program
since the anterior head of the shoulder
is already getting hammered from all of
your chest and shoulder presses
front raises aren't necessarily going to
hurt you but they're just a waste of
time and effort in most cases all right
the second shoulder exercise on the list
is going to be a lateral raise and the
primary goal here of course
is to target the lateral head or the
side delt um this head is the most
important for creating that round
3d delt look and overhead presses alone
are not going to be enough to fully
stimulate it so
this is a case where isolation movements
really do play an important role
lateral raises can be done in a wide
variety of ways using dumbbells
cables a lateral raise machine if your
gym has one
you can even do them with resistance
bands and as long as you're using proper
form and technique i would say that any
one of those variations are ultimately
acceptable
i personally like the standing single
arm cable lateral raise or an incline
bench dumbbell lateral raise
those are just my personal favorites the
benefit of the cable variation is that
the lateral delt gets put under stress
through a slightly larger range of
motion in comparison to dumbbells
since there's active tension at both the
top and bottom end of the range whereas
with dumbbells
they lose the tension in the bottom
because of the direction
that the force of gravity is pulling and
what i like about the incline bench
variation
is how the torso is locked in place at a
set angle and so it prevents you from
cheating and it lets you really just
focus in on the side delts and
standardize every rep but these are just
two options
out of many many different options since
there are just so many different ways
that lateral raises can be performed
now with any lateral raise variation
that you do to maximize the stress on
the side delt
make sure to incorporate a very slight
forward lean because that'll shift the
line of pull
more directly onto the middle area of
the shoulder that you're trying to
target
and this is a movement where i would say
that the mind muscle connection does
become more important
so play around with different angles and
hand positions to find the one that
activates the lateral head of your
shoulder
most strongly for you definitely don't
go too heavy here that's just gonna
cause other muscles to jump in and take
over
and it's also going to stress your
shoulder joint as well so i would say
bare minimum eight reps per set and
probably a bit higher more like 10 to 12
is what i would go with
and just progress very slowly and
gradually on these over time
while maintaining solid form if you're
finding this video helpful don't forget
to hit that like button below to let me
know
i really appreciate the support and the
third exercise on the list
is going to be a face pull so this is a
great movement that hits both the side
and the rear delts
plus the upper back and it's great for
improving overall shoulder health as
well
there are a lot of different face pull
variations that are available you can
pull from high to low low to high
you can pull straight across um there's
different grips you can use a cable or a
resistance band
but this is how i would personally
recommend doing them you're going to set
the pulley to upper chest height
grab on to a rope attachment and hold
the rope from underneath with a neutral
hammer grip
keep your chest up and then pull the
rope back to your face retract your
shoulder blades and also imagine that
you're trying to pull the rope apart as
well and a good way to think about this
is that you're trying to hit a back
double biceps pose on each rep
and then as you bring the weight forward
also let your scapula protract forward
slightly as well okay don't keep your
shoulder blades
pinched back the entire time as you move
forward let the scapula relax
and then retract it as you pull the rope
back and as you progress
to heavier resistance on these if the
weight stack is heavy enough that it's
pulling your entire body forward and
you're losing leverage because of that
then what you can do is just put a box
or bench on the floor right up against
the cable machine and then stand with
one leg pressing into it
but just like with lateral raises this
is a movement that you want to use
moderate weights on
for slightly higher reps uh 10 to 12 is
a good range
you can go even higher if you want and
focus more on control and technique okay
this isn't a movement that you want to
just load up a bunch of weight
and get super explosive with so those
three exercises
an overhead press a lateral raise and a
face pull in combination with all of
your chest presses which will
hit the front delts and then also in
combination with all of your pulling
movements for back which will hit the
rear delts
that should be enough for most people to
achieve very solid shoulder development
but if you want to expand things a bit
further and really hammer your delts
even harder
either because they're a weaker area or
they're just something that you really
want to focus on
then two other optional add-ons would be
a rear lateral raise which will hone in
more on the rear delts
and it will involve a bit of lateral
head as well and then there's also an
upright row
which will hit the lateral head and also
the upper traps so for the rear lateral
raise you can either do this from
a bent over position using dumbbells or
a cable
i definitely prefer cables for this
movement because the dumbbell variation
just has
an awkward resistance curve where it's
really easy at the bottom but then gets
very very hard at the top
but if dumbbells are all that's
available to you then ultimately that's
still okay
you can also do this from a standing
position using a cable machine like you
see here or my personal favorite
which is the reverse pec deck because
this version puts maximum tension on the
rear delts at all points throughout the
range of motion and then lastly for
upright rows
i'd recommend doing this using either a
pair of dumbbells or two cable
attachments like you see here
or my personal favorite which is a rope
attachment i find that by standing
a couple steps back from the machine and
just pulling the rope up until my hands
touch my lower chest
that hits the lateral head really hard
as well as the traps without any
shoulder or wrist discomfort at all
which you're more likely to get when
you're using a straight barbell
and the key thing here is to make sure
that you're only pulling the weight up
until your elbows are at shoulder height
and no higher
if you pull the weight all the way up to
your neck like most people do
that's going to put a lot of stress on
the shoulder joints over time now some
people might be totally fine with that
but for the majority of people
that shorter range of motion is going to
be better and also make sure that you're
keeping the weights moderate here
and that you're doing this movement
under strict control and if you do
experience any shoulder discomfort
then you'll probably be best off to just
skip this movement altogether so unlike
what most people think
this is actually the largest muscle
group on your upper body in terms of
total volume
i also think it's the most important
muscle for giving you that strong
aesthetic
look and those are my top recommended
movements when it comes to building it
don't neglect your shoulder training
don't treat your delts as an
afterthought at the expense of
a million sets of bench presses and
flies and make sure that your exercise
selection and form is dialed in
so that you can build your shoulders
with maximum effectiveness if you found
