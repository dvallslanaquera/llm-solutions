when consuming fitness content online
including mine much of the discussion is
on training variables and nutrition how
many sets or reps what training split
and so on and so forth of course this is
for good reason training and nutrition
are absolutely important for strength
and muscle development
yet there's one factor i wanted to
discuss away from training and nutrition
that might play a crucial role in your
adaptations
this is your mind where your thoughts
assumptions and beliefs reside
rest assured i'm not going to throw a
bunch of motivational quotes to you but
what we'll do is evaluate some
underappreciated research demonstrating
how powerful mindsets may be for
influencing your physiology
and this includes your adaptations in
response to training
the idea that the mind can impact your
body isn't new and chances are you have
your own experiences with this for
example when you're feeling anxious or
nervous about something your heart rate
increases and or you may feel
butterflies in your stomach
however our mind states might also have
effects in areas we do not readily
expect
a fascinating study by crum and corbin
demonstrates how your mindset about what
you nutritionally consume may influence
its physiological impact
46 individuals were recruited on two
different days the participants drank a
milkshake
on one day they drank an indulgent
milkshake that was labeled as high in
fat and calories on the other day they
drank a sensible milkshake that was
labeled as low in fat and calories now
before drinking the milkshake in both
situations the subjects read the
nutritional label and as you'd expect
they rated the sensible milkshake as
healthier
after consuming the milkshake the
response of ghrelin was measured
guerellin is a hormone that is elevated
when energy intake is low to signal the
brain to produce the sensation of hunger
and thus motivate you to consume food
after you've consumed sufficient food
ghrelin is suppressed so you feel
satisfied and no longer hungry
it was found ghrelin sharply decreased
after consuming the indulgent high-fat
high-calorie milkshake but it minimally
changed after consuming the sensible
low-fat low-calorie milkshake
this is what you'd expect a high-fat
high-calorie milkshake should suppress
ghrelin way more than a low-fat
low-calorie milkshake but guess what
the milkshakes consumed on both days
were exactly the same
the subjects were misled into thinking
the two milkshakes were different
through the fake labels displayed to
them
these findings are highly interesting
they indicate despite the milkshake
being exactly the same consuming with
the mindset its high fat high calorie
suppresses the post-grilling response
whereas consuming it with a mindset its
low fat low calories minimally impacts
ghrelin response
some of you may be thinking sure these
findings are super interesting but how
do they apply to developing muscle and
strength
let's find out
what if we could trick someone into
thinking they're taking anabolic
steroids when in reality they're not
would the mere belief they're taking
anabolic steroids be enough to
significantly increase their rate of
adaptations
or does the fact that not actually
taking anabolic steroids mean their rate
of adaptations remains the same
these are interesting questions and if
we travel back to 1973
researchers by the names of ariel and
savile aim to answer them
fifteen main varsity athletes with at
least two years of weight training
experience first trained for seven weeks
during this period those that made the
largest gains in one rep max strength on
the bench press seeded press standing
press and squat would be rewarded with
free access to steroids to use during a
subsequent four week training period
as the researchers promised six subjects
of the initial 15 were selected to train
for a further four weeks while given a
10 milligram pill of dianabol an
anabolic steroid to take daily however
the subjects were unaware the pill they
took was a placebo pill it was not
actually dynaball
the results were truly surprising
after the initial seven training weeks
where the six subjects were not taking
any placebo pill their warning max is
increased by an average of 4.35
kilograms for the bench press 0.73
kilograms for the standing press 2.27
kilograms for the seated press and 2.65
kilograms for the squat
but after the four weeks in which the
subjects took the daily placebo pills
their one rep max's increased by an
average of 13.28 kilograms on the bench
press
7.58 kilograms on the standing press 5.3
kilograms on the seated press and
18.94 kilograms on the squat
thus
their subjects experienced between two
to ten times more strength gains in just
over half the time
simply by being misled into thinking
they want anabolic steroids even though
they were merely consuming placebo pills
another study by magnoris and colleagues
conducted in 2000 provides us with no
less of a surprising insight into the
power of the placebo
the lead author of the study was a power
lifting coach previously his athletes
precisely 11 nationally ranked
powerlifters had asked the coach about
the effectiveness of anabolic steroids
which inspired the coach to conduct this
study
first the researchers assessed the
subject's baseline warning maxes on the
bench press squat and deadlift
note their average one rep maxes were
189 kilograms for the bench press
257 kilograms for the squat and 260
kilograms for the deadlift
so they were pretty damn strong
in the first experimental session
five minutes before testing warner max's
on the bench press score and deadlift
the subjects were given two tablets and
told they were immediate acting anabolic
steroids however the pills were simply
placebo
after taking these two pills all
subjects hit personal records the
subjects one at max's were an average
9.5 kilograms higher on the bench press
12.2 kilograms higher on the squat and
10.9 kilograms higher on the deadlift
versus baseline
fascinatingly the authors noted these
performance increases represented a
change from being nationally ranked to
being internationally ranked for all
subjects
put another way
simply thinking they took a media acting
anabolic steroids instantly elevated the
subject's strength abilities to
seriously impressive levels
after this first experimental session
all subjects were provided with two more
placebo pills to use during their
upcoming training week
during this week all subjects reported
increased vigor and that they were
lifting heavier loads of performing more
repetitions than ever before
in the second experimental session after
the week of training one red max on the
bench press score and deadlift was
measured yet again
however before the one rep max test some
subjects were actually told the pills
they took were merely a placebo
these subjects compared to the first
experimental session
lifted 7.5 kg less on the bench press 11
kg less on the squat and 12.5 kg less on
the deadlift
in other words despite them performing
better than ever before in the first
experimental session and the training
week the simple revelation they had only
been consuming a placebo all along
plummeted their strength back down to
their baseline
the other subjects who remained unaware
the pills they were taking were placebos
did not really make any further gains on
average but roughly maintain the
impressive gains they experience
compared to baseline values

the findings of the two papers
overviewed are truly fascinating and
demonstrate how your mindset or the
belief you're taking anabolics can
powerfully influence strength
it's unfortunate neither study looked at
muscle growth but given we've seen
mindsets interact with physiology it's
very possible muscle growth is similarly
impacted
it would be awesome if future research
can examine this
now how can you use these findings of
the research we've overviewed to help
yourself
needless to say it's going to be pretty
much impossible to truly trick and
convince yourself you're taking anabolic
steroids
i'm not sure you're going to be able to
truly convince yourself your daily
vitamin d tablet is actually an anabolic
steroid
however now that you're aware of this
research the most practical takeaway is
probably that you just want to be
mindful of your thoughts assumptions and
expectations
if you're someone who constantly says
you have bad strength or muscle building
capacities it's probably best for you to
try to change this and try to adopt a
more optimistic mindset for example you
may wish to try and establish the
mindset you have better abilities than
you once thought
after all remember that in the aerial
seville and magnaris studies the
impressive strength increases didn't
come from anabolic steroids they were
only taking placebo pills
thus the impressive strength gains came
from the individuals themselves they had
that ability within themselves
of course mind states applied to
anything not just lifting weights just
maybe we're capable of a lot more than
we believe peace
