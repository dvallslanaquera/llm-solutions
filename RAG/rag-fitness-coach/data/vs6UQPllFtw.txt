so
hey folks dr mike here jared feather
here
we're here with armand bagdasaraf
you may know him as cheesyfit on
instagram these kids with their insta
handles
you know what i'm saying so armand
because he's
from the great nation of georgia yes it
is actually a country
in the soviet area of the middle east it
is known for specifically two things
actually three incredible cooking high
level wrestling
and super high level weightlifting they
actually have statistically the best
wrestlers
on the face there so naturally armand is
here to
not wrestle but get tortured by jared
and i in a super
insane back shoulders and biceps workout
garage series so if you're still coveted
out check out this video
hopefully by the end at least we can use
armand's
dying body to illustrate how proper
garage training should be
jared any last words for your friend
sorry man
[Music]
i get two questions a lot first one is
how do i become successful like you dr
mike driving a
jared feathers hyundai sonata not even
have a car of your own
vip ship folks that's for another
episode gotta get in my car the re
keep rolling the real question they ask
me is
how many sets of bent rows are we gonna
do for this workout and what's the rep
range well
wrap range is roughly 10 to 15 reps and
we'll adjust the load and number of reps
to stay hopefully in that range at least
in the first couple of sets
it's okay if we get some rep drop off
into the five to 10 after
as far as set numbers this is a pretty
big workout armand is currently going to
be doing his last week of training
overreaching
so we're looking at three to five sets
here plenty of work and remember we have
tons of other exercises ahead
we're gonna do a great job but save a
little bit something for later
excellent big breath in and pull
[Music]
four
five excellent touch every time
good
good rest for a second last one
good technique
[Music]
that's it awesome awesome
awesome awesome so he did two top sets
with uh
185 we wanted to keep him within the 10
to 15 rep range
falling out of that rep range a bit so
we're going to go ahead and do a down
set with
you know minus 10 percent on the on the
bar so down to 165 he should get back up
to the 10 15 reference
yes my dad
[Music]
hey america america
next exercise another three sets what
we're going to do
is do an interesting superset with bent
rose it's not normally something you do
although it's a cool thing to do in a
regular
gym but we have different machines in a
regular gym to target this this is
something you can really do to boost the
variation
when you're training at home in a garage
and you only have a barbell here it is
we're gonna do a full set of rows to
chest which means it touches right
around the nipple line
all right we got that out of the way
touch right around the nipple line and
then when you go
really close to failure you can't do any
more with that you switch
same set to bent rows to the tummy which
are mechanically more advantageous
thus easier or you can continue to get
more reps with the same weight
thus we get a chance to reach failure or
close twice in the same set making it a
super set
really awesome movement let's get right
into it our mom's going to show us how
it works
you got this last one
big chest and rest for a second
good all right realign
and begin rows two tummy time lower back
beautiful one
two control the descent
three last one
one more one more one more you know i
was playing with you it's just
boom another one stay upright
stay upright one more oh yeah more more
more more stay upright let's go
big chest oh that was dog shit that's it
good enough
very good job very good job the crowd
doesn't like you
[Music]
alrighty folks so typically with the
back the erector complex
the rhomboids the middle and upper traps
uh lower traps included they typically
have a maximum recovery volume that's a
little bit lower than the other muscles
because they strain so hard to produce
such great forces and a bunch of
different movements
so a lot of times when you do multiple
sets of bent rows those muscles are
pretty cooked
but the lats can still use more work now
typically in a setting where we have lat
pull-downs and pull-ups and stuff like
that we can do that
we could also do a little bit of a more
isolation exercise for the lats
the dumbbell lat pullover luckily we
have all kind of a decline set up here
with the driveway
it gets us a really big stretch at the
bottom good finishing movement at the
top
let's get into it big chest at the
bottom
up
excellent keep it rocking
more you got at least three more
big open control touch up
good should you go to failure on
pullovers the dumbbell pullover machine
pull over it's super easy with dumbbell
pullovers
failure almost always happens at the
extreme end of the range of motion which
isn't really dangerous
you just have to let go of the dumbbell
it falls at the ground it rolls away
who knows what's happening so it's okay
on this movement specifically
to stop like one rep shy failure when
you know like on the next rep i may or
may not have it
maybe it probably will but i don't want
to chance it stop there and it's okay
because training that close to failure
is basically as good as training failure
and if you really want more stimulus
just do an extra set let's modify it
real quick
you're gonna squeeze into my hand
squeeze squeeze down and then go
[Music]
squeeze squeeze good stuff try to push
it all the way
through
push all the way through push push push
push push push push and down
last one go go go go go
all the way up go go go go
go go that's it rack
good stuff man
[Music]
so we're going to be doing a super set
of lateral raises to upright rows with
dumbbells
great great great exercise one of my
favorites the lateral raises we're gonna
do with super range of motion style
which means
all the way up okay and we'll show you
guys in a sec what we mean by that when
our mom doesn't
is this a safe exercise for almost
everyone it is
if you have a shoulder joint that
doesn't have a ton of flexibility
if you have previous shoulder problems
either don't do this exercise or
really ease into it and remember the
weight you're going to be able to lift
here because the extreme range of motion
is much lighter
but you'll notice that if it's an
exercise you can string together
a couple of times and it feels great it
is going to get you an
unreal pump metabolite burn and feel of
tension in the side delts
even a bit in the rear delts tiny bit of
the front delts it's an
awesome all-around shoulder builder give
it a shot no dogma no religion you have
to do it this way
it's totally fine to do it the other way
where you just go up to here or
something like that
give it a shot ease in super lightweight
if it feels off
don't do it but if you like it keep
giving it a shot
very good there you go
way to control
[Music]
one more armand do what it takes
go go
yes control slow control and once you
get to the bottom you're going up right
rows
now seven now go one
[Music]
two hang out up
three lead to the elbow let's go up
four more here
five six way to hold it up there
up seven last one
up slow good
very good
so armand is actually a pretty good
programmer as well himself
we've actually interacted quite a bit he
showed me some of his programs he's
doing what most people would consider
like push
pull leg split style of training uh
really he's just programming the muscles
at whatever frequency
they've recovered from the next session
uh so we can hit them again so with
lateral delts and biceps we're attacking
them on at the end of his
pull sessions i believe he puts them at
the end of his push essence two hits
them three to four times a week
because that's when they recover so
we're doing three sets of lateral raises
which you saw
this intensity technique lateral raised
upright row and now we're gonna do three
sets of curls
because um i believe he has them
programmed today and like again two
other
three other times a week all right all
right hit it out dumbbell twist curls
outside of the dumbbell yep good thumb
flush against perfect
twist hard at the top
again they don't have to go into neutral
at the bottom uh
i think some people just do that because
of elbow injuries if you can stretch if
you can stretch deep here that's perfect
hit it there you go rep one
perfect twist hard at the top
when you curl forward you're trying to
fight your elbows in towards each other
control good technique only perfect
every rep should look like this yeah
mind why don't you bitch out and rest a
bunch at the bottom
let's go go go go that was sarcasm
motherfucker
excellent more to cheat yourself
come on up let's go
more go no breaks no pauses
go push now twist twist twist
there it is another one at least another
one shoulders back shoulders back
shoulders back
curl push twist twist twist
elbows elbows one more
go go go go go go go go what are you
doing what are you doing
curl yes elbows in lss
yes there it is and slow
that's it good stuff
disappointed all right get on in here
while you're breathing heavy we'll outro
the video
folks that's all we got our mom was a
good sport
did a great job if you're stuck in a
garage and you need an awesome workout
you can do this one remember this is a
peak week workout so if you want to
start
a progression make sure you're a couple
reps shy of failure
a few sets uh less than he did
and then slowly work up by adding reps
adding load adding a few sets here and
there over time
after four to six weeks or so you're
going to be at that peak
deload repeat thank you so much
jared any final words of wisdom
oh my god look it's dunko park
[Music]
