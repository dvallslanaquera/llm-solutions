if you're not losing belly fat right now
or just body fat in general
even though you feel like your diet is
on point most days
then what it means is that
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to explain
one very important reason why you're not
losing belly fat even though you might
think you're in a calorie deficit and
you're following a quote-unquote
healthy diet and this isn't just about
losing belly fat okay this principle
applies to overall fat loss in general
since they're ultimately the same thing
and this is a mistake that a very high
percentage of people make when trying to
lose fat okay i don't know if it's
exactly 80
but it's a very high percentage
nonetheless it might even be more than
that since we know
that the vast majority of people who
begin a fat loss diet ultimately end up
failing in the long run
so let's just jump right into it now
there are obviously a lot of different
potential reasons for why you might not
be losing belly fat right now
but at the very base level the most
fundamental reason as you've probably
already heard many times before okay the
underlying reason is that you're not in
a consistent calorie deficit
or you are in a calorie deficit but that
deficit is so small
that the results are coming at a very
slow pace and one of the major reasons
for this one of the major reasons why
this happens for a lot of people
and why it might be happening for you is
that you're simply viewing fat loss with
too narrow of a lens in other words
you're looking at your diet within the
short term scope of individual days
rather than viewing it like you need to
be which is as the average
of what you're doing over the course of
the longer term so you might be saying
okay today was a good day of eating you
know i ate clean i was in a calorie
deficit so that was a success
and then maybe tomorrow the same thing
maybe the next day the same thing okay
great but then the weekend comes and you
decide to reward yourself and so you let
loose a bit
um you have a few extra treats you go
have a big restaurant meal and several
drinks on top of it
and then maybe the next day you do
something similar and then you go back
to your fat loss diet the following
monday
and you might think well i was good
monday through friday so it's fine if i
was
bad on saturday and sunday because it's
more good days than bad days so i'm
still going to lose body fat
but in reality that's not how fat loss
works fat loss
at the core is an overall numbers game
based on how much total
energy you're consuming versus how much
total energy you're expending
not just for one day but for the entire
week and the month and the year as a
whole
and i'm not saying that calories in
versus calories out is the only thing
that you should care about
nutrition wise okay food selection and
macronutrient intake matters too
for the sake of optimizing your overall
health and keeping hunger controlled
and building muscle effectively so
basing your diet around
minimally processed whole foods and
getting insufficient protein that's
still also very important
but when it comes purely to the question
of fat loss total energy in
versus total energy out is the
underlying name of the game
so just because you happen to be in a
deficit for a few days in a row and a
surplus for only
maybe one day that doesn't guarantee fat
loss or at least
it doesn't guarantee fat loss to a
measurable significant degree
because it ultimately comes down to what
the total size of the deficit was over
those few days
combined versus what the total surplus
was on the following day or the
following
few days so if you average let's say 500
calories below maintenance for five days
in a row
uh let's say monday through friday
that's a total net deficit of 2500
calories which is pretty good and that's
a little over two-thirds of a pound of
fat
but if you then go and eat let's say 750
calories above maintenance on both
saturday and sunday
you've now cut your net deficit from 2
500 calories
all the way down to a thousand calories
which is now an average of about 140
calories below maintenance
for the entire week as a whole which
isn't very much and isn't going to have
you
losing fat at a very significant rate
and that's just one example you know
maybe when
nutritional tracking errors are
accounted for you're actually averaging
maybe 400 calories below maintenance
during the week and then you eat
a total of 2000 calories above
maintenance over the course of the
weekend
in which case you've essentially erased
your entire deficit altogether

so there's nothing wrong with taking
periodic breaks from your diet
and having say a refeed day once a week
or so where you eat at your calorie
maintenance level
or just having days here and there where
you just go ahead and let loose and eat
in a straight up surplus without
worrying about it
but if you're currently not losing belly
fat or you're just not losing body fat
in general
and you're serious about leaning down
and getting into better shape then you
have to be aware of how those days are
fitting into the overall picture as a
whole
and recognize that there's nothing
inherently special about the time frame
of 24 hours
not a lot happens in terms of fat loss
or fat gain
within that short 24 hour period we just
happen to
organize our time that way and we happen
to think in those terms because of our
sleeping and waking cycles but in
reality
it's what you do over the course of the
entire week and the entire month and
even the entire year as a whole
that's going to truly determine your
resulting bottom line body composition
how many total calories did you consume
on average across that time frame and
how many total calories did you expend
on average
across that time frame that's what it
boils down to it's normal for things to
fluctuate from day to day
but it's the long-term average that
makes the real difference
so if you think your diet has been good
overall but you do have days where your
calories
uh spike up for whatever reason and
you're not getting the fat burning
results that you're after right now
if that's the case then you need to look
at things a bit more closely
and consider how your calories might be
averaging out when everything is taken
into account
so all the foods and all the beverages
all the snacks and treats
okay everything for the week as a whole
because most people without realizing it
are actually consuming
quite a few more calories than they
realize when everything is
tallied up in detail and if things
aren't averaging out to
around 300 to 500 calories below
maintenance per day then you're either
going to lose fat so slowly that it
won't be very motivating and it will
probably take quite a long time to get
to your goal
or you just might not lose any body fat
at all if you're currently not tracking
anything at all in terms of daily
calories and you are consistently
dropping fat and that's totally fine and
you should just continue on that way
okay that's the ideal situation to be in
but if your fat loss has stalled out and
things don't seem to be moving at all
you're going to need to take some time
to buckle down and really monitor things
more closely to get yourself back on the
right track
and then as a final point here i should
also mention that this whole concept
works the other way around as well
in other words if you are losing body
fat at a reasonable pace
and you do stay on track with your
deficit the majority of days
then you should also keep in mind that
one quote-unquote bad day of eating
where you don't hit your deficit and you
just eat at maintenance or in a calorie
surplus
if the majority of days are on point
then those temporary spikes are not a
big deal
and you shouldn't beat yourself up over
them or think that one
high-calorie day means you've ruined
your diet because it's only going to
have a minimal impact
on the long-term average if you eat at
maintenance on a given day
then nothing happens at all it's
basically just a wash okay it's just a
brief pause where you don't gain or lose
fat
and if you eat in say a 500 calorie
surplus
that only bleeds out an extra 70
calories per day across the entire week
as a whole or if you only did that every
two weeks
that's 35 extra calories per day which
is very little
so this is another potential source of
fat loss failure
where people actually are doing a very
good job in the overall picture
but then they get overly discouraged and
they lose motivation whenever a given
day doesn't go as planned
because they overestimate the effect
that it's actually going to have which
is usually quite minimal
if things are otherwise reasonably on
point for the week and for the month
as a whole so bottom line if you're not
losing belly fat right now or just body
fat in general even though you feel like
your diet is on point
most days then what it means is that the
long-term caloric average is still too
high and if you are losing fat
effectively even though you might have
some bad days here and there
then it means that the long-term caloric
average is still within a proper range
and so you don't need to stress out over
those higher calorie days here and there
calories in versus calories out is the
ultimate deciding factor when it comes
to losing fat
and this applies not just in blocks of
24 hours but rather for the week the
month
and the year as a whole if you found
