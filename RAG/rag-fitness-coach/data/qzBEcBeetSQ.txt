i'm like holding him and i i remember
having his arm and i'm pushing on his
arm and i felt his arm go
so i get we get in this building we go
it's very shady i see money getting
i feel like i'm a i'm a rooster about
the fight i didn't even know if i was
getting out of here live
i was like i'm taking his arm i'm gonna
make this attack so his arm goes
it may sound like you take like a water
bottle empty water bottle that's what it
sounded like
this is like a movie now like if i lose
i'm gonna get burnt on the street and if
i win
am i gonna get burnt on the street
this guy's like 250. i go to foot sweep
him my
foot hits he doesn't move and as i'm
walking over
something doesn't feel right i look down
my toe is like this
oh this stuff know that this is true by
the way
damn it
[Music]
my name is ricardo nigleris i'm a fifth
degree black belt from helsin gracie i'm
also a co-founder of balance studios
here in philadelphia i competed in a lot
of high-end tournaments such as
ibjjf pan-americans i got gold medal in
that in 2004 i also traveled to brazil
in 1999 where i placed in the world
championships
as well as the gracie worlds that was
done in at the arnold classics
and a lot of grappler quests and other
tournaments here in the local area in
the united states
[Music]
so basically jiu-jitsu entered my life
by chance yeah i was getting in a little
bit of trouble
you know the worst thing i was doing was
getting in fights you know
and phil pulled me in you know i was in
and out of the gym but i didn't really
stick to it
and a couple incidents happened where
i got a little bit of trouble and phil
was like dude get in the gym
where i was heading what i was doing on
the street was not
uh not the right direction so jiu-jitsu
once i got in there i just saw the
people in there
i saw how i saw the results of jiu-jitsu
not only physically but mentally and i
knew i wanted to be there so i
did whatever i had to do to stay in
there i had no money
so i cleaned the toilets i cleaned the
mats i taught the kids class
i did whatever i had to do i couldn't
even afford a ghee i think there's a
picture
of me when i went to california
i didn't have a geek so i had to search
through the lost and found and you see
like
the one geese like up to here on me and
i have one
yeah and i'm like but i wind up winning
i wonder winning the tournament so
i was getting i was getting good at
tournaments i wasn't always good at
tournaments
you know i was i was actually pretty bad
because i didn't understand the point
system even when i thought i was winning
i was like
ripping the guy around throwing him on
top i'm like yeah he's throwing me on
the bottom i don't realize when he comes
on top of me oh he gets two points and
takes to get mad at me and y'all be like
what are you doing rick and i'm like i'm
beating the crap out of this guy we
talking about throwing them all around
he goes no you're throwing them on top
of you he's gathering points you don't
understand
i flew to brazil in 1999
uh it was a blue belt and
there was no expectation of me because
obviously from my
my previous tournament experience i
wasn't really like
i was doing good i was winning winning
like in-house tournaments but i wanted
to prove to myself this was
for nobody else other than myself that i
can do it and i wind up placing
i got second you know that year but i
was the only one out of our
crew that went out that got a medal and
i was like and that
gave me the bug and it's like once you
do that i was like okay
i'm gonna try another one now mind you i
hated
tournaments hated them i never like
tournaments i don't even like them now
because they're nerve-wracking on top of
unorganized
and it's it's just nothing about it was
the actual torment
i enjoyed personally but what i did
enjoy
was traveling out with a group of 15
friends who i trained with piling up in
a hotel
having fun all those experiences that
surrounded the actual fight
i loved it we were laughing i had
pictures for days for like
what we did out there we're just
training we've got vegas mind you i'm
like a kid that
half the kids live in south philly their
idea of going away is going down the
shore
that's as far as they go you know some
of them me i'm going to brazil
i'm going to vegas and i'm getting paid
to go now so
we would referee out there we'd referee
the tournaments we'd get paid to go
they would put us up on the hotel and
give us a little spending money for food
and then we got the fight for free
i had no obligations uh you know i had
no kids i was like let's do it
i remember i used to get frustrated
because jiu-jitsu
whether you're athletic or you're a
genius
it just puts you and humbles you whether
it's mentally or physically it just
humbles you and if you don't i always
say there's two types of people come in
type of person that walks in gets his
butt handed to him
nicely and gets frustrated and leaves
never wants to do that again and the guy
who goes in there
gets his butt kicked and says what is
that
so i was the kind of guy was like i want
to know what that was i want to be able
to do that
another thing it did for me was it built
me to
be a leader even if i wasn't a natural
leader which i'd like to say i was but
even if i wasn't you gotta understand i
was a south philly italian kid
nobody really took seriously everybody
expected to be in jail
because i was fighting all the time uh i
was just a wild thing
i was misunderstood and jiu-jitsu
helped me like i had doctors lawyers
judges i mean people that you look up to
coming in because everybody was curious
about this
this sport in this martial art it
attracted those people
and then you see me and i happen to be
good at this
and when you are a young kid at 16 years
old where you were never taken serious
by
people of this of this stature and all
of a sudden they're calling you over hey
rick come here
can you show me what you just did it it
makes you feel
like okay i got a purpose so now and
it's not something where i'm going to be
condescending now
it's something where i'm going to all
right now i'm going to help these people
so where before i was like man i got
this thing i'm not showing everybody
anybody this this is like
i got the golden ticket man i'm choking
guys out i'm only 180 pounds i'm beating
guys are 250 pounds
i'm not showing anybody this you start
to learn like man i'm going to show
everybody this
i want to help people this stuff has
helped me and it continues to help me
see jiu jitsu lifestyle it's not a hobby
by all means it's not a hobby there's so
many ins and outs of
this lifestyle that that's the addiction
i come in here my dentist does jiu-jitsu
he's a black belt
my lawyer does jiu-jitsu he's you know
he's uh
my the best of friends that i meet i
meet people that are
all different religions all different
backgrounds
you know man girl whatever whatever the
case may be
i get to to meet people that we share
a common uh liking to and it's just like
you know as messed up as the world is
out there i build a little world
inside this community and i feel like
that's the trick in life
i have bad days just like everybody else
i don't care if you're
poor you're rich you came from this you
came from that
you're gonna have bad days you're gonna
have messed up things that happen to you
you're gonna have messed up things that
happen to people you love you're gonna
have to channel that stuff somewhere
and i know this because i was an angry
kid for no reason
and i had anger issues you know and i
didn't know why
you know and my outlet was fighting it
was fighting on the street i was like
you know i was just confused i was told
you're stupid
you're that and everything you know
comes together as a kid if you don't
know how to channel that
and you just don't understand why it's
happening oh well there's adults like
that
the jiu jitsu is as real and as raw as
it gets just the lifestyle itself
because you can't lie about jiu jitsu
without
proving it on the map you can't say oh
you know listen uh there's no lying if
you don't put the work in and train
you're gonna get beat on the map
and it's gonna show your work actually
means something
in jiu-jitsu all right you go on
instagram
you think everybody's life is great not
jujitsu you come in
you know what's up you know if you put
the work in you know what it takes like
i gotta work hard to get to where i want
and i can't be worried about this guy
this guy i can't be worried about what
he's working on
i got to work on everybody has their
individuality
when they walk into this place and they
all walked in for different reasons and
not
any of them are the wrong reasons you
walk in to lose weight
you walk in because you're getting
picked on you walk in because you need a
stress reliever you walk in you just
want to
you know you want to learn about
self-defense however or whatever it is
you are walking in here for it's the
right reason
i'm more addicted than anybody that
walks in here this addiction does
never ends so i love jujitsu just as
much as the person that's
just starting jiu-jitsu it's just on
another level now
so you'll never find me i'm not the kind
of coach who will
put the timer on and blow the whistle
i'm 41 years old and i haven't had
everybody's life and they get old
i was like well you have to respect age
too you know i respect the aging process
but i will be damned if i'm going to
accept
what other people's view of an age is
what i cannot and can do
