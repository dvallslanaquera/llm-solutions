cross-education is the term given to the
increase in strength
and potentially even size of an opposite
limb after training only one limb
for example let's say you trained only
your left arm with dumbbell bicep curls
for the next few months
before and after doing this you test a
one rep max dumbbell biceps curl with
your left arm and right arm
additionally you measure the size of
both of your biceps
the left arm the arm you trained would
of course experience increases in
strength and size
however despite you not training the
right arm
it will also likely experience some
increases in strength
and perhaps even some size
this is cross-education there are many
other synonyms for cross-education
like the contralateral effect cross-limb
transfer
interlimb transfer bilateral transfer
and many others i'm sure many would be
questioning the mechanisms behind
cross-education
how is it possible that training only
one limb results in strength and
potentially size gains in an opposite
limb that you did not train
we'll explore the potential mechanisms a
little later but first
let us explore just how much strength
and size gains we might expect with a
cross-education effect
let's first explore strength gains a
meta-analysis by manca and colleagues
gives us an insight into this area by
the way
meta-analyses are studies that combine
the results of numerous individual
studies
that address the same topic 31 studies
were included in this meta-analysis
the average duration of these studies
was around five and a half weeks
they range from only three weeks to 12
weeks in duration
so keep this in mind when interpreting
the results based on the 31 studies
the untrained opposite limb which could
be the muscles of an arm or leg
experiences an 11.9 percent increase in
strength
straight away we can see this is a
meaningful strength increase
but it would also be useful to know the
strength increase for the trained limb
as this would allow us to make
comparisons between the two percentages
unfortunately this meta-analysis did not
report the average strength increase for
the trained limb
nonetheless from the 31 studies i
decided to go out and collect the
percentage increases in strength for the
trained limb
i should note that this isn't exactly
the way meta analytics do it
there is a little more detail to it but
it should give us a rough idea of what
we are after
out of the 31 studies there were five
studies i could not get the data from
this was either because i could not get
access to the paper
or because they did not report the
strength increase for the trained limb
from the 26 studies i looked at on
average training one limb resulted in a
27.6
increase in strength for that limb
putting it all together
training one limb increases the strength
of that limb by 27.6
while the opposite limb that you did not
train at all experiences an 11.9
increase in strength we mustn't get
carried away with these numbers
simply because the 31 studies these
numbers are from are quite divergent
some studies had participants train the
muscles of one side of their upper body
whereas other studies had participants
train the muscles of one side of their
lower body
contraction modes also varied some
studies use typical exercises that
involve
concentric and eccentric phases called
isotonic exercises
some used concentric early training
others with eccentric only training
and even some with isometric only
training
fortunately this meta-analysis included
sub-analyses
that looked at these various areas when
isolating the studies that looked at
training one side of the upper body
the train side experienced a 24.3
increase in strength
while the untrained side experienced a
9.4 increase in strength
when isolating the studies that looked
at training one side of the lower body
the train site experienced a 30.9
increase in strength
while the untrained side experienced a
16.4 percent increase in strength
note the percentage increases given for
the train site is from my analysis
detailed earlier
not the meta analysis nevertheless it's
apparent that the cross-education effect
is more pronounced with the lower body
for contraction type training one side
of your body isometrically
resulted in a 22.9 increase in isometric
strength for that side
the untrained side experienced the 8.2
increase in isometric strength
training one side of your body
concentrically resulted in an 11.3
increase in concentric strength for the
opposite side of your body
unfortunately from the 26 studies i
assessed
none looked at concentric only training
so i could not calculate the average
increase for the trained limb
training one side of your body
eccentrically resulted in a 17.7 percent
increase in eccentric strength for the
opposite side of your body unfortunately
from the 26 studies i assessed only
three looked at eccentric only training
and the percentage increased from each
very dramatically meaning it was not
sensible to average them out
isotonic training resulted in a 15.9
percent increase in strength for the
untrained limb
the trained side based on my analysis
experienced a 33.1
increase in strength so overall
eccentrically overloading one side of
your body results in relatively
the greatest cross-education effect
the meta-analysis also found somewhat of
a correlation between the strength
gained in the trained limb
and the strength gained in the untrained
limb implying that the greater strength
gain you experience for your trained
limb
the greater strength gain the untrained
limb would experience
let's now move on to muscle size
unfortunately
there are no meta-analyses looking at
cross-education and muscle size
but nonetheless i went out and searched
for as many studies as i could
assessing how training one name can
impact the size of the untrained
opposite limb
i found 11 studies of these
four found that the untrained limb did
experience growth but the remaining
seven found no growth of the untrained
limb
of these seven studies three of them did
not find growth of the trained
limb either in other words the protocols
used in these three studies
were likely not sufficient to induce
muscle growth the other four studies did
find growth of the trained limb
but no growth of the untrained limb so
when looking at the current evidence
although some evidence suggests that
untrained limb does not experience
growth
we do have full studies suggesting
growth may occur in untrained limb
let's get a quick overview of these four
studies in hope of drawing some
conclusions
brown and colleagues had 14 elderly
untrained men
perform unilateral elbow flexions or two
to four sets
three times per week for 12 weeks
cross-sectional area of the trained
elbow flexors increased by 17.4 percent
while cross-sectional area of the
untrained elbow flexes increased by 7.2
percent
bezara and colleagues had 10 untrained
subjects before maximal isometric knee
extensions
with their right leg three times per
week for six weeks
unfortunately they did not provide the
actual numbers
but they did present a graph looking at
the graph
we can see that as expected the right
leg experienced significant increase in
quadriceps cross-sectional area
however for the left leg although it was
not classified as statistically
significant
we can still see there was slight
increase in quadriceps cross-sectional
area
magnus and colleagues split 23 untrained
subjects into a training group
or a control group training group
trained one side of their body with a
variety of shoulder exercises
three times per week for four weeks
thickness of the supraspinatus
and anterior deltoid increased by a
significant amount for the trained side
the untrained limb did not experience
any supraspinatus growth
but there was some anterior deltoid
growth despite it not being
statistically significant
lastly bayer and colleagues split 17
untrained men into a training group
or control group the training group
trained their dominant leg with a
unilateral leg extension
for three sets three times per week for
four weeks
thickness as well as cross-sectional
area was measured for the vastus
lateralis
and rectus femoris as expected
significant increases were observed for
all measures done on the trained leg
as for the untrained leg although the
increases were not statistically
significant
we can see some increases in
measurements mainly with the thickness
and cross-sectional area of the vastus
lateralis
so overall we do have some evidence that
an untrained limb can grow in response
to training the opposite limb
but the amount of growth does not seem
to be much
it only appears to be a slight increase
in muscle size
moreover the four studies were conducted
on untrained individuals
although i could not find any research
on trained individuals
i think it's very likely they would
experience smaller increases in muscle
size
or perhaps even no growth with
cross-education
one of the real world applications of
the cross-education effect
is when you injure one side of your body
if your injury is severe enough
it may need to be put in a cast meaning
it is immobilized
immobilizing a limb for an extended
period often results in strength and
size decreases for the muscles in that
immobilized limb
training the limb that is not
immobilized can help attenuate any
strength and
size loss that may have occurred in the
opposite immobilized limb
thanks to the cross-education effect
none of the studies we have looked at so
far in this video
had participants immobilized their
untrained limb in all of the studies
participants continued using their
untrained limit in normal life
nevertheless there do exist studies
investigating the cross-education effect
when the opposite untrained limb is put
in a cast
a review paper by andrew andrewsko and
colleagues assess the research in this
area
five studies have investigated how
training one arm can
impact the size and strength of an
opposite immobilized arm
all five of these studies had a control
group for comparison purposes
these control groups had one arm
immobilized
but they did not train either of their
arms note
i am indeed saying arm as far as i'm
aware
there are no studies assessing the
effects of cross-education
when one leg is immobilized let's first
look at strength
when averaging out the five studies the
training groups experienced a 26
increase in strength for the trained arm
for the opposite immobilized untrained
arm they experienced a 4.6 increase in
strength
the control groups on average
experienced a 2.5
decrease in strength for their
non-immobilized arm
and a 13.3 percent decrease for their
immobilized arm
therefore cross-education not only
attenuated strength loss for the
immobilized arm
but it also helped to increase strength
these five studies were conducted on
untrained individuals
i think it's highly likely that if they
were well trained
cross-education would probably not
increase strength of the immobilized
limb
but it likely would go some way to
attenuating any strength loss
moving on to muscle size the training
groups experienced a 3.9
increase in size for the trained arm and
a 0.2
increase in size for the opposite
untrained immobilized arm
the control groups experienced a 0.6
decrease in size for the non-immobilized
arm
while their immobilized arm decreased in
size by 3.8 percent
therefore training one arm was effective
at pretty much maintaining the size of
the opposite immobilized arm
again the subjects were untrained with
trained subjects
i'm not sure if training one limb would
be effective at maintaining the muscle
mass of an immobilized limb
but it probably would go some way to
minimizing decreases in muscle mass
okay let's now explore the potential
mechanisms behind the cross-education
effect
let us start with muscle size there are
two hypotheses i've come across
the first hypothesis relates to hormones
the second relates to mirror activity
let's explore the first hypothesis
muscle growth can simply be thought of
as a result of muscle protein synthesis
exceeding muscle protein breakdown over
time at the cellular level
an increase in protein synthesis as well
as a decrease in protein breakdown
is a result of various signaling
pathways signaling pathways are where
various proteins interact in a chain
reaction fashion
and in our case would result in a
synthesis of proteins
or more simply the creation of the
proteins that make our muscles bigger
moreover some proteins as part of
signaling pathways can
inhibit the activation of other proteins
one particular pathway involved in
muscle hypertrophy
is the pi3k akt mtor pathway
a protein called pi3k activates a
protein called akt
akt then activates m2c1
which is a protein complex m2c1 can
activate
s6k1 s6k1 then initiates muscle protein
synthesis in ribosomes
ribosomes can be considered the factory
in which proteins are created
this particular pathway can also
decrease muscle protein breakdown
akt is thought to inhibit foxoproteins
these foxoproteins are involved in
muscle protein breakdown
i should note this is a fairly
simplified view of this pathway
but for this video it will suffice so
how are signaling pathways initiated one
way is through hormones
lifting weights temporarily elevates the
levels of various anabolic hormones
such as growth hormone igf-1 and
testosterone
growth hormone is believed to primarily
exert its anabolic effects
through its stimulation of igf-1
production from the liver
igf-1 binds to igf-1 receptors on the
membrane of muscle fibers
this binding initiates the p13k akt
m2 pathway similarly i've come across
evidence suggesting testosterone could
play a role in initiating this pathway
too
through binding to a different receptor
also
testosterone is thought to bind to
androgen receptors within the muscle
fiber
this event is also thought to play a
role in muscle growth
when performing unilateral resistance
training
these anabolic hormones could be
released into circulation
and they could potentially through the
events just discussed
induce growth in the opposite untrained
limb however
there are no worthy limitations to this
proposed mechanism
multi-joint exercises that involve large
amounts of muscle mass
result in the circulation of these
anabolic hormones
single joint exercises such as the ones
that would be used during unilateral
training and hope of eliciting the
cross-education effect
hardly if at all result in the
circulation of these anabolic hormones
moreover even if unilateral single joint
exercises did result in the circulation
of anabolic hormones
there does not appear to be much of a
correlation between acute hormonal
responses
and muscle hypertrophy meaning that
despite the logical rationale behind why
exercise-induced elevations and anabolic
hormones may contribute to growth
the weight of the current evidence
suggests that training programs that
elicit high elevation of those various
anabolic hormones
hardly if at all produce greater muscle
growth than training programs that do
not elicit much elevations in anabolic
hormones
on to the second hypothesis mirror
activity refers to the phenomena that
during unilateral resistance training
the corresponding opposite muscle not
being trained
experiences slight activation magnus and
colleagues found that during isometric
training for one biceps brachii
the opposite biceps brachii not being
trained which was immobilized
was activated at 3.1 percent of the
biceps brachii being trained
similarly during isometric training for
the triceps brachii
the opposite triceps brachii not being
trained which was immobilized
was activated at 6.1 percent of the
triceps brachii being trained
another study by andrewsko and
colleagues found that during unilateral
wrist flexor training
the opposite wrist flexors not being
trained which was immobilized
was activated at 5.6 of its maximum
voluntary contraction so there does seem
to be something going on during
unilateral training that results in the
opposite limb experiencing some
activation
however it is very slight and i'm not
sure this level of activation would be
sufficient to induce muscle growth
during everyday life people probably
experience this level of activation
or even slightly more with numerous
muscles during simple
tasks but of course these events do not
usually result in a hypertrophy
ultimately both hypotheses have their
limitations
but i don't think we can completely rule
both of them out much more research
would be needed in this area
what about the mechanisms behind the
increase in strength of the untrained
limb as established although the
untrained limb could increase in size
the growth isn't significant therefore
muscle growth probably cannot explain a
large part of the significant strength
gain
observed in that untrained limb
accordingly adaptations in the nervous
system
which is the brain and spinal cord
likely explain this
to understand these potential
adaptations we first need a basic
understanding of how the nervous system
interacts with your muscles
the reason muscles contract is because
they receive electrical signals that
originate from the brain
there are two neurons also called the
nerve cells in this system
an upper motor neuron and a lower motor
neuron upper motor neurons originate in
the cerebrum which are the hemispheres
of the brain
and are mostly endo particular region in
the spinal cord
lower motor neurons mostly originate
from the spinal cord
and end at a muscle as just mentioned
the cerebrum consists of two hemispheres
[Music]
the right hemisphere controls the
muscles of the left side of the body
while the left hemisphere controls the
muscles of the right side of the body
let's look at the simplified events of
contracting your left bicep
upper motor neurons from the right
hemisphere of the cerebrum
send an electrical signal down its
length at an area where the medulla is
located
some upper motor neurons cross over to
the opposite side of the body
the other upper motor neurons continue
down the same side
at the spinal cord regardless of whether
the upper motor neurons crossed over
they can transmit the electrical signal
to lower motor neurons
once these lower motor neurons get
sufficiently excited
they send the electrical signals down
their length and transmit the signal to
the muscle they enervate
which in our example is the left bicep
the electrical signal within the bicep
ultimately causes it to contract
the upper and lower motor neurons have
names the fibers of the numerous upper
motor neurons that come down from the
cerebrum
are collectively known as the
corticospinal tract
cortico refers to the cerebral cortex
this is the outer layer of the cerebrum
which is the location of where the upper
motor neurons originate
spinal of course refers to the spine
which is where upper motor neurons
mostly end
the lower motor neurons that receive
signals from the corticospinal tract
and subsequently transmit these signals
to contracting muscle fibers
are called alpha motor neurons as
established
the corticospinal tract originates in
the cerebral cortex
the outer layer of the cerebrum
ultimately
there are numerous regions of the
cerebral cortex that play a role in
causing muscle contraction
a review paper by fraser and colleagues
suggest that the dorsal pre-motor cortex
supplementary motor area and cingulate
cortex
on one side of the cerebral cortex have
strong connections to the homologous
zone on the opposite cerebral cortex
meaning that there are connections
between the right and left dorsal
premotor cortex
connections between the right and left
supplementary motor area
and connections between the right and
left cingulate cortex
remember when training only one side of
your body one hemisphere of your
cerebrum
and therefore cerebral cortex would be
primarily activated
adaptations that occur in the activated
regions of one hemisphere
particularly the regions just discussed
could be somewhat transferred to the
opposite hemisphere
through their existing connections this
transference of adaptations to the
untrained hemisphere
which controls the opposite untrained
limb could somehow result in an
increased strength of that limb
another potential mechanism behind the
strength gain of an untrained limb
relates to an increased excitability or
decreased inhibition
of the corticospinal tract associated
with that untrained
limb to understand what this means we
first need to understand the structure
of a neuron
remember numerous fibers of upper motor
neurons
make up the corticospinal tract a neuron
has a cell body
from which dendrites are an extension
these dendrites are primarily
responsible for receiving
signals from other neurons one neuron
receives many signals from many neurons
if most of the signals a neuron receives
are inhibitory
then the likelihood of the neuron
generating an electrical signal is low
conversely if most of the signals
unknown receives are excitatory
an electrical signal will then likely be
generated
this signal is transmitted along the
axon on the axon
we can see these structures called
myelin sheaths
they allow the electrical signals to
travel along the neuron quicker
as we continue along the neuron we can
see the axon branches out
these branches are called axon terminals
the axon terminals essentially transmit
the electrical signal to other neurons
an increase in corticospinal
excitability
would imply that the neurons making up
the corticospinal tract
receive more excitatory signals from the
neurons they communicate with
this means the muscle this corticospinal
tract is associated with
which in our case is an untrained muscle
will receive more signals
resulting in greater muscle contraction
which is the same thing as saying it is
now stronger
although there is evidence finding an
increase in corticospinal excitability
with cross-education
as noted in the review paper by fraser
and colleagues
there are numerous papers finding no
effect on corticospinal excitability
with cross-education there actually
seems to be stronger evidence supporting
a decrease in corticospinal inhibition
a decrease in corticospinal inhibition
would imply that the neurons making up
the corticospinal tract
would experience less inhibitory signals
from the neurons near their dendrites
this decreased inhibition would make it
more likely for the neuron to fire an
electrical signal
ultimately resulting in more signals to
that untrained muscle
meaning it is stronger the last
potential mechanism we will look at
relates to inter-hemispheric inhibition
inter-hemispheric inhibition
refers to the phenomena where one
cerebral hemisphere
inhibits the opposite cerebral
hemisphere one study found that an
increase in strength of an untrained
limb
was accompanied by a 31 decrease in
inter-hemispheric inhibition
from the trained hemisphere to the
untrained hemisphere
this would imply that the untrained
hemisphere as a result of the decreased
inhibition from the other trained
hemisphere
would be able to transmit more
electrical signals that ultimately end
up at the untrained muscle
though there are also studies finding no
impact on inter-hemispheric inhibition
with cross-education at the end of the
day
despite the potential mechanisms behind
the strength increase of an untrained
limb
being more studied than the hypertrophy
increases of an untrained limb
more research is still very much
required to fully understand the
mechanisms
behind it
