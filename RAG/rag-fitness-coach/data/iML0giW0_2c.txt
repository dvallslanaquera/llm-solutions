what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i want to answer
a pretty common question that i get
which is why do i have low body fat and
yet i don't have visible abs or maybe
your abs are somewhat visible
but they just aren't that impressive
looking and i'm going to give you three
possible answers to this question okay
so three reasons why you have low body
fat but no abs
the first answer very simple and
probably the one that applies in most
cases here
and that is that your body fat
percentage isn't actually as low as you
think it is
you know i get people direct messaging
me every single day whether it's through
instagram or facebook or email
and they're looking for advice about
their physique you know maybe they want
to know if they should bulk or cut
and in the majority of cases when they
send a physique picture along with their
estimated body fat percentage they're
usually way off the mark sometimes by as
much as five percent or more
based on how i would personally estimate
it you know they might say they're
uh 10 body fat when they're actually 14
or 14
when they're literally close to like 20
and that's either because they just
aren't experienced enough
to accurately estimate body fat
percentages or it's because they're
relying on some sort of inaccurate
measuring device
like the body fat scale at their gym for
example unless you're doing
dexa scans which is the most accurate
way to measure body fat and even then
still has
a reasonable margin for air there's
really just no way to know for sure
what your true body fat level is and in
most cases people way overestimate just
how lean
they actually are depending on your
individual body fat distribution
as well as how well developed your ab
muscles are which i'll talk about in a
second here
um as a male you're probably going to
need to be down somewhere around about
15
body fat as a minimum in order to really
start seeing your abs poking through
and in order to have a clear six-pack uh
when flexing
probably around 10 to 12 for the average
person
and the truth is that for a lot of guys
that's not an easy thing to do okay a
true
10 to 12 percent body fat is actually
quite lean it's leaner than probably 99
of the general population and it does
require real discipline and proper
dietary structure to get there
and to maintain it over the long term if
that's what your goal is
so if you think you're sitting at a
fairly low body fat level right now but
you can't see your abs
or at least you can't see them clearly
chances are that you still have
too much overall fat covering your mid
section you're overestimating how lean
you currently are
and you just need to grind through and
drop some additional body fat in order
to get to your goal

all right the second reason why you
might not have impressive looking abs
despite being at a lower body fat level
has to do with
body fat distribution in other words
where your body
preferentially stores its fat which is
largely going to be determined by
genetics
now men in general do tend to store a
higher percentage of their body fat
around their mid-section area whereas
women tend to store more fat on their
lower body
but the exact degree is going to vary
between different people
and if you're someone who stores a
higher than average percentage of body
fat on their midsection
then unfortunately you're going to need
to be at an even lower body fat level
than the average
person in order to have a clearly
visible six-pack
and this is something that i know all
too well because i personally tend to
store
a pretty high percentage of fat on my
stomach area and even at 10
body fat or even less i'll still have
noticeable excess fat down there
and my abs never really look that
impressive whereas for other guys who
maybe store
more fat on their legs they can be
sitting at maybe 13 or 14
body fat and still have a flat and lean
looking set of abs
now the upside is that the other areas
of my body like my shoulders and arms
and legs
all of those will still look pretty lean
even at a higher body fat level
and i'll still have good overall muscle
definition and vascularity even at 14 or
15 body fat but the downside
is the extra fat that i'll end up
carrying around my mid-section area
so unfortunately this is something
that's mostly beyond your control
and it just comes down to weighing out
the pros and cons to decide
what body fat percentage suits you and
suits your preferences the most
at this point for me i personally don't
have any aspirations of having
a super lean six-pack again because i
know that in order to get there i'm
gonna have to drop my overall body fat
percentage
down to a level that i'm not comfortable
sustaining and that would detract from
the rest of my physique yeah i might
have a six-pack but then i'd have to
sacrifice
overall muscle fullness throughout the
rest of my body my strength and my
energy levels would go down
my face would be too lean and sunken
looking which i also don't like
so doing all of that just to have abs
isn't worth the trade-off
especially since most of the day is
spent in a shirt anyway
and that's why i personally choose to
stay around 12 to 14
body fat but at the end of the day
everybody is different and that's
something that you're going to have to
decide for yourself
and let me know in the comments what you
choose to do in this area where do you
typically store your fat and is it worth
it for you
to drop your body fat percentage low
enough just to have a six pack or do you
keep your body fat a bit more on the
moderate side

then the third reason why you might be
sitting at a lower body fat level
but not have impressive looking abs is
because you're lacking in
actual abdominal muscle development so
having a low enough body fat percentage
is going to be the most fundamental
factor
in terms of having visible abs because
if your body fat is too high
then they'll just be covered up but
training your ab muscles for hypertrophy
that is another important step as well
because the better developed your abs
are
the more noticeably they're going to pop
out the more visible the separation will
be
and also the more visible your abs will
be even at a slightly higher body fat
level
so don't make the mistake of thinking
that compound exercises like squats and
deadlifts
that those are going to be enough to
fully train your ab muscles because even
though basic compound lifts do provide
some stimulation to that area it's not
going to match what you'll get
by actually training your abs directly
keep in mind that the abs are a muscle
just like any other
and they respond to progressive tension
overload in exactly the same way
so it's not about pumping out ultra high
rep body weight exercises using some
silly
ab training circuit and pumping out reps
until you feel the burn
it's about loading the abs up with
resistance within a moderate
hypertrophy based rep range i like
anywhere from about 10 to 15 reps for
most abdominal exercises
i'm going slightly higher or slightly
lower is fine too it's about getting
within a few reps of failure while using
perfect technique and then striving
for consistent performance increases
over time just the same way as you would
train any other muscle
and there are plenty of different
effective ab exercises out there that
you can perform
but a basic crunching movement that
should typically be
your main go-to exercise since spinal
flexion is the primary function of the
rectus
abdominis and for me i personally prefer
the kneeling rope crunch because i find
that that's the best overall movement
for maximizing abdominal stimulation but
it could also just be
a standard weighted crunch on a decline
bench or on the floor or a machine
crunch is another
option as well and then aside from that
leg raises are going to be another good
option to put more emphasis
on the lower portion of the abdominal
wall so either a lying
leg raise or a hanging leg raise reverse
crunches are another good add-on
depending on how much ab training you
plan to do
and then in addition to that plank
variations are another great way to
train the abs isometrically
and improve overall core stability as
