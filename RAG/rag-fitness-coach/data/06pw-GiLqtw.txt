meeting is being recorded folks it's the
weekly q a
no longer the weekly webinar dr james dr
mike
in person we're next to each other
this is bizarre this never happens i
don't know why it happens maybe a couple
times a year sometimes a year
so folks we're here in montana we're
here to answer your question so we're
just going to
jump right in and get to it
it's always fun to do these side by side
instead of over zoom
we were just laughing because we were
like looking at some of the comments and
there's always some like jokes that we
don't remember even saying like what was
the fruit i don't remember this at all
all right so i'm thinking we start at
this guy's name is dick wellington
all right dick you don't have to read
his question i'm just laughing at his
name
oh well let's let's hit him up okay hey
docs i'm a type 1 diabetic and i've been
training for the last six years pretty
heavily
and planned i've got pretty jacked to
the
point anytime i go out to the borrower
club i'm approached by men telling me
how thick
with two c's i am or questioning my
bench numbers
i wonder if i have good genetics or if
it's the anabolic nature of all the
insulin
for the first two years of lifting i ate
very high carbs and protein meal for
every meal like 300 plus grams carbs and
100
plus grams protein for post-workout yeah
i also had to dose the insulin
accordingly
uh i've since eased off the large doses
to stay leaner you guys are fucking
awesome fake
content so it's mostly your genetics and
your good training but the insulin sure
didn't hurt and probably helped at the
margins
yeah normally we would say like for
people who are dealing with
diabetes like you might kind of the the
benefits you might gain from the insulin
is often offset by the lifestyle that
you have to live so you kind of probably
are at a net neutral but in this case it
sounds like you're
your body's soaking it up like hell yeah
give me that
marcus roll is applauding yum yum give
me some
insulin parentheses all right how about
tomer with the uh
naruto so
tamer says should i aim to eat as soon
as i wake up to maximize
mps so generally what we give as decent
advice is
if you eat within an hour maybe two
hours of when you wake up you're doing
probably a really good thing
if you're waiting two to three hours or
longer after you wake up to eat you're
definitely missing out on potential
growth time
and i would say at the margins you are
also
a little bit more catabolic for longer
than you want to be so
it's not a good idea generally speaking
you want to spread your meals out
relatively evenly so
as soon as you wake up i think james and
i just don't want people to get the
perception that like
if you don't have a protein shake by
your bed you're going to die metabolism
you can wake up walk your dogs uh take a
shower poop
brush your teeth get out and eat you're
totally good to go yeah i think
a lot of people ask this question in the
context of like um
uh like fasted cardio like i want to do
my cardio first thing in the morning
and usually we'll say something like if
you for whatever reason whether you're
not a morning eater maybe you have a
hectic morning schedule or maybe you
want to do some like fasted cardio
you can kind of split the difference and
maybe just have like a little bit of
your whey protein shake
maybe some carbs in there and just it's
slightly better than nothing at all for
like several hours post
work post waking up but at the same time
like mike said don't think that like
the first thing you have to do is sprint
to your your meal and
if you don't do that then something's
wrong that's that's not the case at all
yep okay let's do this more here
marine mc irene our buddy arena going
that's right under what circumstances we
change out an exercise mid meso
so it's really um mid meso we we
definitely try to stick with what we've
chosen because it can throw off the rest
of your thing if you introduce a new
exercise
but what james and i probably say
is the definite reason is you have
persistent
growing pain doing that exercise in like
joints or something
so like if your knee is like away on the
hack squat one day and then the next day
it's like ah
away and the day after you can barely
warm up it's time to stop hack squatting
um if you have a really crappy sfr
you can change out your exercises but
we think that most cases keep trying to
fiddle with it
alter the technique a little slow down
the reps trying to get the mind muscle
maybe play with the technique to try to
get the best sfr
worst case scenario is at the end of the
mezzo you'll be like fun i'm doing that
for a while
right but generally speaking yeah pretty
much like
the best reason to change out or
compelling one is persistent
increasing localized pain uh if that's
not the case
then you can probably stick it out in
most cases for the mezzo you don't have
to go further than that
yeah i think you you could make a case
about like if the exercise is going like
so
flat your mev mav values are like
you know 10 sets to get anything going
on the movement then you could be like
okay this one's just not going that
great
but even then i would still agree with
dr mike where it's like just finish out
whatever you were doing
and have a nice clean slate on the next
one so what we don't want
is for people to say like oh you said
you can swap out exercises because
they're stale or flat
but then it's like you're never doing
anything consistent it's very hard to
track and you're never making like
really tangible progress on the
movements that you've chosen for a nice
extended period of time
i think some of the best training you'll
have is when you pick a movement that
has a good sfr
and you're able to use it for like three
or more mesocycles without it going flat
that's when you're going to see like
huge
huge gains and whatever either strength
or muscle mass on that particular
movement
yep there's another thing too if you are
real quick to switch away from a
non-optimal sfr move you're like
i'm not feeling it you're actually
potentially losing out on playing around
with the technique in a setup
and finding out a really good sfr
movement so for example if you put you
on like a
a flat machine press like you had the
seat a little
back and you had your close grip
pressing position because that's when
you felt better on all the other
machines you're like this just hurts my
shoulders and elbows
i'm gonna rotate it out okay what if you
tried it two or three more times
put the seat forward more to get a
bigger stretch and widen your your
pressing grip
and all of a sudden two sessions later
you're like oh my god this is direct
chest blast yeah had i walked away from
this i wouldn't figure it out
i actually like hack squat for me the
way i used to do it
hurt my knee so much that i just told
people not to hack squat i didn't do it
for years
and then i finally stuck with it and
developed a really great technique
and now it's one of my favorite quad
exercises so it's kind of like don't
walk away too soon
if you're advanced sometimes you know
well if your advantage just won't pick
exercises you know or shift for you
but if you're beginner intermediate
stick around you might find out how to
really optimize things
and when you are advanced very often
like what you'll find is like you're
trying
you're trying something new because like
you're like myself or you're like i have
a
at home set up i've exhausted some of my
like barbell movements let me try these
sissy squats or something and then you
do it you're like
this is fucking terrible let's just do
something like a lunge or whatever else
and just
and that's when we nip it in the butt
right away and you say like
week one even in session one so actually
you have it as a warm-up and then you
switch to a real life you just you just
know it's not happening but when you're
beginner intermediate is worth playing
around with more and just to get a feel
for it option
this name what the fuck
sounds like some more door shit sorry
nobody uploaded you so you have to
sorry with your vikings michael ong
michael ong
says hey doctors i have a question in
regards to loading variation within a
micro cycle in a previous video dr mike
recommended to possibly have loading
variation within a micro cycle such as
five to ten reps earlier in the
microcycle
10 and 20 and 20 30 reps later in the
same micro cycle would this be
recommended to during cutting phase yes
or is this something that should be
geared more towards masking and possibly
maintenance
no maintenance doesn't matter much as
long as you're stimulating something a
little bit it's really quite easy
maintenance if you're a beginner
intermediate it's probably best to do
mostly five to ten because it allows you
the lowest possible volumes but also
practice
doing heavy lifting which you're going
to need if you're more advanced
especially really big and strong
you actually do your maintenance a lot
with two sets of 20 to 30 because you
want to give your joints a break because
like if you're always squatting 600
pounds like pressing 800 like
you need to back the fuck away from that
shit for a little while and it says i
understand that higher reps are better
sfrs during a cut
yeah progressively so during the cut as
it goes on so i'm not sure if i have
a varied loading range that would be
recommended during a cut so we actually
addressed this in our scientific
principles of perturbative book
we actually address your exact question
showing how
your loading ranges within the weeks
should alter over the mesocycles in a
cut
so there's kind of a face tension there
so get a look at that but generally
speaking you do a mix of all of them
it's just when you add volume in your
later mesos you add it to the slower
twitch
or sorry to the higher rep ranges not
the lower ones
i haven't seen this thumbnail for a long
time
and i'm just it's i've caught it out of
the corner of my eye and i
fucking hate this one it's so
distracting and weird looking i can't
see it yes that's my goddamn arm we were
hoping it people
more people would click on it but i
think it scares people away
oh god it bothers me um but yeah i
totally and then you could make a case
too like for your maintenance phases it
might be good to conserve
um some of the rep range variability
that you might benefit from
more during massing or cutting so like
mike said usually we'll say like
do five to ten ish reps during your
maintenance because it pushes your
necessary volume so low maybe like you
could use the 10 to 20 on some movements
like
arms like you're not gonna be doing sets
of six on your biceps necessarily so
arms might keep higher
delts might keep higher but um you might
actually get more out of those
you know maybe 15 or more uh rep ranges
when you're doing something like a cut
or a mass so it might be good to
conserve those for later on unless like
mike said you're you're dealing with
injuries and things like that
let's see
not a ton of upvotes on some of these to
someone
how about gingerbread boy here this is
kind of interesting a similar note that
we just talked about
gingerbread boy says i'm currently one
third of the way through a cut and i
want to swap out some exercises
some because they've become a stale some
i want to change for new exercises to
see what kind of sfr they have
would it be better to wait until i'm in
a massing phase would i be missing on
any potential additional gains by
changing exercises
lost on a cut supposed to change you
want to start my next
mass phase i don't think you're missing
out on much of anything you can change
it
just make sure you're not abandoning
exercises you could have had as good
variants
that's the only thing i'd say i also
would say be careful about changing
exercises really often on a cut
because one of the reasons you do the
same exercise is a small one but
nonetheless one that's noted
is you want to keep tabs on your wrap
strength to see if it's staying
stable at least so you know you're not
fucking up and losing muscle if you lose
exercises if you use exercises like very
different ones every week or two
you could actually be getting weaker and
not know it because you're like oh it's
all novelty i'm getting great pumps and
then all of a sudden you're like oh shit
i got a lot weaker on the exercise of
the matter
and then so i'm not against doing that
either the one thing i will just
caution you is i think during a cut in
particular you're probably more
susceptible to what we call a type 2
error a false negative
where you're already just kind of flat
and blah so you might switch a new
exercise
out and you're like i feel flat and blah
but you would have felt flat and blot
anyway whereas on mass it'll be just
more obvious that
like damn well you could also maybe say
on mass you might be
prone to making a false positive as well
but i think the cut
is more noticeable in that like you just
even if it's good you might not get a
big pump or a lot of soreness either way
so just be careful with that it's not
that doing it on a cut is bad it's just
that's just something to look out for
let's see
all right let's do it let's do the
birthday finally all right
kyle bowser asks vertical leg press i
turned the garage into a gym during the
pandemic due to limited supply of right
and rising cost of your equipment the
only leg press machine i was able to
acquire was a vertical life press
there's a reason for that
um it was it is not great the
positioning is awkward ram is limited
and i have trouble isolating the quads
do you have any tips for making this
exercise work better should i just sell
the damn thing
tip it 45 degrees that's the best way
what you can do is put a real big pad
underneath your butt
slash hip area and then you can make it
a little bit better it's not going to
make it any more comfortable but it will
make it hit the quads more
um which essentially just turns it more
into a 45 degree press
but honestly whenever you get a chance
to sell him by a real leg press i would
do that i would just buy arsenal's leg
press because the arsenal line press is
the best light brush currently on the
market and uh
believe it or not designed by people who
lift weights to allow you to lift
weights
the vertical line presses like james and
i were literally just talking about this
before we started recording
we're just upset that it even exists all
it does is cause you like causes the
human to turn into like a roly-poly
basically it's just there's no
thanks there's nowhere to go um so we're
not a fan of that one um
i honestly i can't think of any way you
can jimmy rickett to make it better
i would say at that point it might just
turn into like a cool strong man
implement where you just
like find a way to load it on your
shoulders and you could do like strong
man squats or something like
you stand in the middle of it turn yeah
upside down
sorry oh jr has a question super upvoted
okay
let's do that one what jr asks what do
you mean when you say
you can add a light session on another
day example heavy bench one day and
light another session later in the week
are you talking about light up the
volume light weight same volume
with higher rir 50 load so we usually
say it's not in all context but in most
light session actually just means
recovery session and that usually means
you use roughly 50
of a working weight and you do like
fewer reps and not anywhere near failure
so that it's literally just like
warm up slash technique work and even
you can do it at a high velocity
so to get really good at benching you
can boom put a lot of speed into the bar
but it has to be
not pushing your muscles to the limits
remotely that's what it
counts as a recovery session and the
colloquialism for that is sometimes
light session we generally try to stay
away from saying light sessions and say
recovery sessions
because light can mean higher rates
confusion and we're still close to
failure but
that's generally the gist of what we
mean yeah and then sometimes you can use
it to literally mean like a
lighter type workout so you might have
like your
five to ten bench press day which is we
might do
you know some top sets and down sets of
just like some heavy bench
and then like a lighter day and this
again this is where the
phrasing gets kind of funky but you
might have a different chest day where
you're doing some like
10 to 20 cable flies like that the the
load
that you're placing on the muscle is
just way less
from those two comparing those two
movements right so you could say that's
a lighter day
not only in terms of like the actual
thing that you did but in terms of
like how much sets you did or how many
reps you did blah blah blah you can kind
of play with it a couple different ways
but generally
like mike said it's that means like a
more of a recovery kind of session more
often than not
yeah hey now
this is a really good question what's
the difference between mayo sets
and giant sets they seem very similar so
maya ram sets generally don't target so
giant sets the way we use them which is
apparently pretty wrong because giant
sets mean something else everyone else
it means like multiple exercises strung
together
which is fucking stupid what we really
mean when you say giant sets is marathon
sets
which is also stupid so we're just going
to start calling them giant sets and see
if we can
change the way people talk about it um
giant set is really easy to define
you take a weight and you give a total
number of reps to yourself and you do as
many sets as it takes to get to that
weight or to get to those number of reps
so let's say you have
20 pound lateral raise dumbbells you
have to get 60 total
you do like a set of 20. it's pretty
hard you stop you wait however long you
want
you can do giant sets with short breaks
you could do them with normal brakes
usually they're done with normal brakes
so you rest like two minutes and then
you do another 12 across the failure two
rar whatever then you
you sit around one of the really great
uses of giant sets
is that sometimes when you're trying to
match reps exactly
and get carried away and your mind
muscle connection and technique can
break down because you're like i gotta
get 19 and then
17 18 19 looks like three giant question
marks what the fuck was actually going
on
with giant set you know you have all the
time in the world to get to 60 total
so you can stop each set when your
technique starts to break down
which means it's really good way to
practice it's like a new exercise or one
that's kind of awkward
like for example like if you do bent
over dumbbell lateral raises
you can't you can't rep match on those
because at some point you're like i
don't even know what i'm doing anymore
you
start to do this your elbows start to
bend it's really hard to standardize
but if you do okay today i'm doing 50
total next week i'm doing 55 week after
i'm doing 60 the week after i'm going
back to 50 book with like two and a half
more pounds in each dumbbell like that
actually works really well
my reps is just when you get into a
machine
and you say i'm gonna have two my rep
rest breaks which means i get rest break
of like three to five seconds
when i go close to failure and then i do
another little mini set close to failure
i don't put anything down i don't put it
away
i take three to five seconds to get a
rest again that's the second my rep
break and then i go again so it's three
mini sets two breaks in between and then
you're done
there's no goal reps at the end of that
usually you can rep match like that or
you can just say i'm just going to see
how many i can get
in the next week you maybe put five
pounds on the bar and match those mini
sets exactly and get the same total
number of reps with the same two rest
breaks
so the my wraps is definitely one in
which you're expected to perform at a
certain element
and there's no total total amount that's
usually the goal
whereas they're just organic sets with
two rest breaks
giant sets are really just a bunch of
sets strung together without without as
much pressure to
whatever number you get in each set
really doesn't matter as long as you get
the total
do people really when they say giant
sets they basically are talking like
kind of like circuit training more or
less literally circuitry i've never
never
understood it to be that yeah because
people would just say circuit training
or supersets or something
exactly so i don't know people usually
say like hey we super set five machines
together
and i was like it's called the giant set
like okay like mila sarcef does shit
like that
you know yeah my rep sometimes if you
look at like uh
like 1990s 2000's era muscle and fitness
magazines they would call it rest pause
same rest pause yep reps just particular
way of doing rest pause
yeah with the rest prescribed at like oh
depending on who you talk to three to
five or five to ten seconds
and just keep in mind these are you know
you can call them intensification
techniques or just
you know modified protocols but these
are things that like
probably most people don't really need
to fuss with too much
until you've kind of exhausted your meat
and potatoes just straight sets
kind of workouts so usually around that
late intermediate stage where
you know you've got your sfrs dialed in
you have your technique individualized
but you also you know have accrued quite
a bit of adaptive resistance so some of
your workouts can start to get pretty
arduous
these are things that can help kind of
dial it back into a more manageable
realm for you
but you might also argue that mile reps
are one that sucks so bad maybe it has
the opposite effect in some cases
because it's so painful and awful
i use it strategically it's strategic
exactly the the big ticket with my reps
is the realization that being around
failure is really hypertrophic but going
all the way to failure
is really fatiguing and then you say
yourself okay in one set i can be around
failure for just
a few reps and then i have to stop or if
you do my reps you can say i can be
around failure at
three different mini attempts and never
actually get to failure
so from an sfr perspective especially
for advanced people my reps
depending on the setup if you can rest
at the top like a hack squat you just
lock out your knees and you can sit
there for minutes and be fine
you know you don't like my up exercises
like dips you don't my rep dips
because you're up there like i have
three seconds until i can do one more
this isn't rest so with my reps you can
flirt around failure longer
and not quite get there which is kind of
the best of all worlds so it really is a
good idea
yeah i think like what you said with the
setup is that because something like a
cable curl or something like you just
put it down like
one two three okay easy go good you know
if you're trying to do it like a bench
press or something yeah
like
[Laughter]
okay what about what the fuck is that
cream wtf is that cream
asks hi docs what in your opinion are
best exercises for each major muscle
group in terms of the str
ratio uh the stimulus to time ratio
i know this is highly person specific
but possibly less so than the sfr
ratio as rest slash setup times and the
t and the str ratio wouldn't vary as
much between individuals you would think
people flush it up a lot
yeah agreed at least that would be my
uneducated guess
more context i'm trying to lay out my
long-term programming for a period where
i won't have as much time for training
as i would like to do work
i found that str ratio a very helpful
concept for doing so
but it'd be great to know what exercises
actually stand out when ranked by str so
i'll tell you
i can't give you exact exercises we can
give you some rules to follow
one is the more compound the more
muscles they involve generally the
better so like
maybe one of the ultimate str exercises
is like the clean and press
the clean front squat press so if you do
a clean and then you
do a front squat and then you come up
into a press and you rack and do a clean
i mean that's like 80
of your muscles in your body with one
exercise so i'll tell you what if i had
someone who
unbelievably short amount of time i
could do like uh basically set up three
things
set up a barbell or a smith machine
where you can do inverted
rows and then set up a place for
push-ups and then do
clean like probably do like a stiff like
a deadlift
switch to clean front squat press drop
do that exercise until you get really
tired then go do push-ups
then go do bent the inverted rows and
then over again
that is your entire body and three
exercises if you do like three rounds of
each like set close to failure rest 30
seconds
set close to failure push-ups rest 30
seconds do three rounds of that whole
thing that might actually take you about
10 minutes
and your entire body like for someone
super advanced it would be maintenance
work
but for someone not super advanced
that's a little step forward in 10
minutes and you could do that every day
or every other day or whenever you find
the time i'm glad you brought that part
up because
usually when people have such rigid time
constraints they aren't advanced they're
just training for fitness and health and
that's
totally fine and that i think some there
are i'm going to go off dance but i can
only train 10 minutes a day like
right now get ready to not be advanced
anymore and that's where like you can
kind of
go off the deep end a little bit because
i was actually while you were talking
about that i was thinking about some
gymnastics movements like can you do a
like a jumping uh ring muscle up that's
a fucking shitload of
muscle you know like if you could if you
could do it i certainly can't jesus
christ
but you can kind of look at some of
those things and say like that hits that
checks quite a few number of boxes and
if you're not
obviously trying to be like a john
meadows ronnie coleman kind of guy
because you only have 15 minutes to work
out
you could incorporate some of those
things like dr mike said kind of like
some of the the weight circuits with
some gymnastics type movements and you
can pretty much cover your bases
really really fast fuck man i tell you
what an interesting combo is
if you're pretty good at pull-ups you
get a pull-up bar set at a certain
height
you do a full depth squat jump up
pull-ups pull-ups pull-ups down fold up
squat jumps up pull-ups maybe you just
wanted
that's brutal when you get tired of that
you walk back and you have a
stiff-legged deadlift bar
you do stiff-legged deadlifts until you
can't put it down back up a little do
push-ups
and then you rotate that's literally
your whole body and whatever exercises
that's brutal yeah i fuck that fuck all
that
yeah as far as an exercise type crossfit
won the str games oh you're literally
the entire purpose of the sport is how
much work can you do in how little time
that's all their events that's literally
str like
work and stimulus aren't that different
you know you just have to wiggle with
the exercises so it's not just mindless
work but it's hitting your muscles and
then you're good to go yeah
another real quick recommendation
because you know we want you to get some
value out of this
when exercises are compound there are
spectrum
from biasing compounds or non-biasing
compounds or general compounds or
specific compounds
so if a compound that's a biasing
compound is for example a
white group bench yes this is
technically a compound but it barely
hits
you triceps at all it hits your pecs a
ton so it's really like a pec fly but
it's a compound movement
so if you're like yeah i'm doing
compound like i'm doing wide rip bench
and i'm doing like
white grip rows like you're hearing rear
delts and your chest not a whole lot of
other shit
so you want to do more general less
specific less
isolationy compounds and we're less
targeted compounds in which case like
close to a bench is a real good one
if people ask all the time is coaster
bench for tricep or is it for chests
like well it's really for
a lot of both you know and rows if you
do rows with like a closer in even
underhand rows they do a lot of your
bicep
and your the whole rest of your back so
choose your compounds to the ones that
hit the most musculature or not
nominally compounds but end up just
really hitting one muscle a lot and
very few others yeah that's really good
and actually
i was thinking about the advanced point
what mike said i'm really glad he
brought that up because i was just
thinking like well what do you do if
you're advanced
well most people would say like what are
my probably some of my best str
movements like we
got you're doing deadlifts you're kind
of like many of your pressing movements
maybe like incline bench
something like that but if you're
advanced and you have to deadlift like
over 400 pounds
you're actually spending the entire
session just putting weights on the bar
at that point so that ends up being a
bad str choice in terms of your total
session even though it hits all the
muscles because you have to put all the
weight on the bar take it off
so think about it like that too like you
have this has to be like quick and easy
to set up dips push-ups
lunges bulgarian squats you don't have
to warm up a ton
okay one more we have one more let's do
believe it or not we get through these
quick when we're
live and in living color this one
actually had eight replies only one
upvote but i'm wondering if this is
this actually we beat that one to death
in a lot of our other books yeah
here we go chris chris hey cruz
the uh the devil from south park
hey docs i have a hard time getting good
mind muscle connection with my
latissimus dorsi my posterior deltoids
trapezius and tears may just say back
motherfucker oh seemed to do most of the
pulling i thought he had a
muscle connection probably i thought
that's where he was going with too i was
like motherfucker i don't think about
terry's major ever what the fuck is a
terrorist major
man i tell you what when i was in the
military they called me terror's major
sir so i'll come in from a workout and
be all disheartened and they'll be like
how did it go honey i'd be like
fucking terry's major is giving me some
trouble today just couldn't feel it
couldn't feel
that connection it's okay you'll get it
next time honey you'll get it
but like she says that but in her mind
like deep down she's like
he's never gonna get us high she's not
capable of it she needs to get a
major connection or your piece of shit
belongs not in society
okay hard time getting the lats but uh
posterior delts
trapezius and tears major seems to be
most appealing see my avatar for the
imbalance well can't really see a whole
lot there i could see some scapula look
like you have big lats yeah so
do you have any recommendations and tips
yes google lat prayers
otherwise known as straight arm lat pull
downs so basically they're called lab
prayers
yeah that's what mano says anyway okay
so that's a funny name for it yeah
um you take the bar basically here you
get a real big stretch it's a cable
pulley
and you go all the way down without
bending anything you go all the way down
to touch your hips and you can even come
up just
we have there's a bunch of videos in um
and all over the internet
so front uh like you know one arm sorry
um
straight arm pull down straight arm lat
pull down straight on black poles or lat
prayers google any of that and it'll
come up
that's a really good thing for you to
sort of pre-exhaust with if you are
doing rows and you want even more and
so first of all so first of all that's
the case second of all lots of
pull-downs
lots of pull-ups different grips
different positions less rowing
because clearly rowing is just going to
bias those muscles more
and some people are always trying to
like rig a row to be as much left
as possible and i was like well you know
you can just do a pull-up that's almost
all that like you know what i'm saying
your upper back's not gonna
your your traps and shit like that
aren't gonna help you much so
that is really the kicker is to make
sure you're prioritizing exercises to
hit the lats more
now as far as execution when you do rose
and you still want more lap
prioritization
the general rule is don't pull towards
your chest pull towards your hips to
your tummy
so if you have a barbell row pull it
down if you have a machine row set the
seat really high
so you can pull down into your hips if
you're doing one arm dumbbell rows you
can bend
and literally take the dumbbell and
essentially put it into your pocket
every time and then super stretch it out
super far like this
and then put it back in your pocket as
opposed to going to your chest um
another one is to make sure you pause at
the contraction of each of these lifts
to really squeeze your lats back and
down together
another one is instead of pulling down
to your clavicles when you do pull downs
try pulling down to your nipple line but
stay as vertical as possible that fucks
your lats right in the ass not that
great for your shoulders
not that great for the rest of the back
but it really does a world of good
and this entire time that you're doing
that try to really focus on making sure
that you can feel your lats try some
posing
it's like front relaxed you have to
flare your lats out at the bottom try
that stuff and really do it in the
mirror for a bit google what front relax
pose looks like
do that a bit and you'll get more of a
connection with your lats but everything
you do will come back to that later
really good i found that with those
straight arm pulls um
doing them paused makes a huge
difference for me as well
so if you you can kind of just like if
you just do them regular usually my
triceps get really sore and my lats
don't get very sore but if i do them
with like
just a brief pause or let the weight
stack touch down and then do it from a
dead stop
really really good for the lats and i'm
somebody who typically has
had trouble with lat training as well
additionally with your pull down
variations pulling to the chest is
really good
but really what you're looking for is to
get as much of that elbow
coming straight down movement as you can
if you're somebody
traditionally if you do like a lot of
just normal pull downs you just don't
feel it
try doing some where you really can just
focus on having like an mma they call
this a 12 to 6 elbow going from 12 to 6.
same idea with your pulls try and do an
underhand or close grip once where
you're really just pulling your elbows
straight across your body
and pulling them down and back that
really seems to help if you have like
kind of goofy anthropometry like your
boy here
um especially if like wide grip doesn't
do it for you like if you do wide grip
and everyone's like dude white grip
fucks me up so bad and you're like i
don't get
anything out of that then try try nail
grip milk the eccentric on everything
so don't just let the shit heave down so
when you're doing straight arm pulls
this part should be pretty slow
and also because the lats grow most of
the stretch like every other muscle
your straight arm hole should go to here
and then all the way so almost back
behind the plane of your body
and some assholes on the internet will
tell you the deactivates lats sweet
sure as hell does and then it
reactivates them thus giving them a
break giving maximum stretch under
attention and all the good stuff
so give that a shot and uh yeah you'll
they'll grow
and like some machines depending on how
hard this machine size and how tall you
are you might have to like
lean forward a little bit to get the the
good stretch in that position so if
i do it i'm six one and then if i go all
the way up my arms are gonna be
right here so what i have to do is step
back a little bit lean forward and then
i can actually get it to stretch without
bottoming out the machine every single
time so you have to play around with
that a little bit
another thing you can do is like so you
know myself
and jared and and stuff don't agree with
this gentleman all the time we don't
have to agree on everything
coach kassem is somebody you can go to
instagram and find
he is you know really cares about
activating the lats specifically and
not the upper back and he's got all
kinds of little cool tricks and grips
and stuff that work really well and your
guy knows his stuff so if you're looking
for lat activation that's good
my only caveat is like make sure your
rar is still good like some of the
exercises are
you guys kind of a weird setup and you
kind of like you're like rolling out
here in front it's all lats but like
it's very unclear like
how hard you could possibly try in that
position because you'll fly out of the
chair you'll get no standardization
just standardize the movement try real
hard and do those movements first in
your workouts you really get the lats
going
i guess while we're at it pre-exhausting
is a good idea so start all of your
back workouts for your ones that are
left focused anyway with some real good
straight arm pulling plenty of volume
and then when you go to pull ups next or
pull downs or assisted pull ups
your lats are going to be the limiting
factor and really get torched up
and then you can finish with a row to
the hip or something like that and then
it's all lats all the time as
they're the limiting factors that give
out and sometimes too dr mike i don't
know if you've noticed this but like a
lot of people will train lats like for
sets of like 10 reps and they're like i
don't get anything out of it
right try doing like sets of like 18
like you know hot much higher
15 to 25 yeah especially on pull downs
and stuff
if you have versa grips or chalk or
straps all of a sudden your lats are on
fire and you're like ugh of case that's
a five didn't do dick
and it's funny too because people like
pull ups for sets of five really help
help me
but lat pull downs for sets of five to
ten don't do anything what they're doing
is they're not measuring the total time
that they're applying tension
a lot of times people's mac people
naturally do pull ups much slower
especially on the eccentric
and they're like well i did sets of five
like you know that set of five took you
47 seconds
that's what a set of 18 tick takes you
on pull downs do a set of 18
like oh i have a real similar pump and
then soreness and stuff so
definitely play around with that and i
that's i've been doing that for fucking
years within the last few years when
i've noticed like my lap training hasn't
been very good
like why don't i stop just doing sets of
10 for like my lap movements then it was
like
what was i doing this whole time
probably one of the most important
things about the stimulus to fatigue
ratio concept
is to be aware of like what your sfr
actually is
and stop doing movements that you're
like well other guys do them like what
are you getting out of this like i don't
know my bones hurt yeah that fucking do
it
tendinitis yeah yeah alter the technique
stop doing it doing the way that it's
you a lot of times that means altering
rep ranges and that might look silly to
somebody else you know like i remember
this this guy is really good bodybuilder
back in the day is a vietnamese
gentleman named chris dim
he was phenomenal bodybuilder he said he
would do like some sets of legs it would
be like giant sets
more like meyer upsets but like he would
do like a hundred reps and people like
why
he's like it fucks me up and i like all
right like if that really
really fucks up your muscle and who are
we to say it doesn't you know what i
mean
just don't don't be that person that's
that's a really good example of someone
who's
pretty open-minded to what their own
body is sort of signaling to them
just don't be that person's like
grinding sets of five and like my joints
hurt a lot but i never get a pump yeah
like we literally had people say that
like what do you guys mean when you say
pump or like
what let me just let me show you
training let me show you something
is that a good thing i guess it's a good
thing goddammit so yeah do your best
is that it for today that's it that's
the whole thing we knocked him out all
right
folks thanks for the questions again
just a little housekeeping make sure
if you are looking through the questions

it wasn't the one that you particularly
had in mind but if you're like hey that
guy's got a
pretty sharp question she was trying to
find your question i wish i was that
smart

your question is not
present in the current uh meal you have
questions then go ahead and toss yours
in there and hopefully other people will
give it enough vote as well
