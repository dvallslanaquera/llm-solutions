hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization today's vs
episode is about detoxes
it's going to be a short episode because
they're great they're not even bs they
work you drink that weird liquid you buy
cvs and
just three days of that liquid later and
nothing else you're a new you so to
speak
maybe
but unlikely so here's the deal there
are actually two ways to detox that are
valid
get out your pens and pencils this is
gonna be crazy you're gonna be on the
hollywood diet in no time
way number one is your body metabolizes
or expels toxins through any number of
routes including
delicious routes like the liver
urine sweat vomit etc
suppose you probably even expel toxins
if you do the whole thing with the
things in your eyes and you're like
looking at somebody randomly
in the street you never do that of
course you don't you're a good person
why would you do something crazy like
that
in any case yep sure your body does that
automatically for itself
the liver and kidneys are super ultra
important for stuff like that
and of course if there is a malfunction
with your body
you're unable to expel toxins on your
own or if the amount of toxin expulsion
has overwhelmed your own organ system
you can go to the hospital and they do
the super futuristic detox where they
plug you into a bunch of machines and
machines kind of clean your blood for
you it's not pleasant at least one of
those methods is called dialysis
something really seriously wrong has to
be wrong with you said that twice
it's a bad deal okay that's not the kind
of detox you get after a weekend of
partying that's the kind of detox you
get before weekend of surgery
so
those are the two ways to detox notice
the
drinking apple cider vinegar for two
days straight and only drinking apple
cider vinegar for training straight is
is not on that list it somehow just
didn't make it
mild oversight
we'll take a look at whoever writes
these slides
me
will have to write them better but in
any case what would happen if you just
drink apple cider vinegar or some kind
of weird mix the hollywood diet whatever
kind of detox is cool nowadays what what
happens if you just do that for a few
days and only drink the stuff like they
say well you know some people in
hollywood do that kind of thing
and they get a little bit out of it they
do it when they feel sick from
many days if not more of poor sleep
shitty food unbelievable gobs of stress
alcohol i know it's crazy many of your
favorite celebrities drink
to their detriment
all the time
and of course cocaine which without it
hollywood would never run but you know
that adds up and at some point these
people don't really actually want to
switch to a healthy lifestyle so they go
okay i'm going to be a piece of shit for
many many days straight and then my body
fucking can't handle it anymore i'm
gonna have like two or three days of
only apple cider vinegar and they feel a
little bit de-bloated and they feel a
little bit fresher because they just
stop poisoning themselves for a while
which i guess you could say is kind of a
cure
but hey what are you doing for your new
year's resolution like ah
you know i'll take a few days here and
there where i won't just like
drop cocaine like it's table salt into a
vodka tonic and down that whole thing
slow clap amazing celebrities you guys
are doing great
a better idea however instead of
detoxing which does nothing except put a
pause on your poisoning
is to actually try regular exercise
eating healthy sleeping well take care
of yourself maybe only doing crazy drugs
in smaller amounts on occasion
if you actually do them on occasion they
tend to even feel more like drugs
instead of like the daily you that
you've now become dependent on drugs for
every waking second of your no longer
your own thoughts
that's rough
the reason that healthy eating and good
sleep and good training help is that
they're actually healthy lifestyles that
make you actively healthier over time
instead of just delaying your poisoning
like detoxes do
no you cannot make up
two months worth of shitting on your
body with three days of detoxing it just
doesn't work like that
how can you make up for it well it's all
lost you can't make up for it at all but
you can build a healthier future by
actually eating healthy and exercising
and taking care of yourself and sleeping
and you know do the drugs they're fun
just don't do them too much you know
there's
time and a place for everything and uh
don't do detoxes because their time in
places nowhere because they're fucking
bullshit see you guys next time
