all right folks hip hinges are amazing
for hamstring development
we're going to do three or four sets of
hip hinges here for the guys we are
going to use the belt squat by mr matt
winning amazing machine super well set
up
the grip here believe it or not isn't
the limiting factor for some goddamn
reason the machine is so well leveraged
that your grip feels fine but your
hamstrings are getting torn asunder we
could even say
multiple sets
five to ten repetitions we're gonna be
really focused on the technique of
keeping the chest up keeping the back
arched to keep that anterior tilted
pelvis pre-stretch those hams we're
gonna make sure the knees don't do this
but they're back here the whole time and
