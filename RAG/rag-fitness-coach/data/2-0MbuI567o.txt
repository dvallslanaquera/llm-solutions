let's go Jeff whenever you're ready
buddy whenever you're ready Jeff let's
go give me a second Mike the closest
thing that happens is failure let's go
let's go
[Music]
yo what up clearly I'm Dr Mike from
Renaissance securitization and this is
Mr Jeff nippert of Jeff nippard and he
was gracious enough to descend from on
high in the Heavens to bless us with his
Elven presence for a psychotic RP leg
workout chocolate full of Maya reps and
insanity and all this other stuff now
Jeff nippert is such an important person
and we need to take such good care of
him that we have to have a
board-certified sports medicine doctor
doing the workout with us luckily my
lovely wife Dr Crystal who you can
follow on Instagram as Dr crystal is a
board certified Sports Medicine
physician Jeff if anything bad happens
either I'm to blame or she's to help
that's how it's going to work feeling
good I can't wait I feel great
I love the intros and that's the last
time we'll be saying I feel great let's
kick it
[Music]
I think the shit's folded oh oh my God
let me just Pat it that is that is your
real body what does it look like
fuck whoa
okay
[Laughter]
I feel like come on you can do it no
uh
all right that'll do I think that's
actually a pretty good weight for me I
mean I did three or four perfect but I
think in the eight to ten range I'll be
pretty crisp we won 15-ish well 15 is
yeah oh with a slow tempo like that oh
yeah oh
Jeff today we're talking less than color
adapter there will be Comfort somewhere
today but it won't be in this gym
first exercise is going to be the lying
leg curl we are going to do Maya rep
match something like oh 10 to 20 rep
sets whatever you get on the first set
straight that's the number you remember
that write that down on our RP
hypertrophy app afterwards trade in
everyone does their set everyone
remembers their number second set you
have to get exactly the same number of
reps again but you may be too tired to
do so so if you get let's say 18 reps in
the first set but only 15 on the second
that means you get off the machine relax
for five to ten seconds Shake It Out get
in and do another three reps so every
single set matches the first sets
repetitions brutality is here
awesome
I'm trolling the way down athletic on
the way up
[Music]
good a couple more
[Music]
go yes slow
that's it
okay I have a question for you how many
was that I didn't count I just went to
zero one ear I had to guess I'd say it
was Zay eight seven or eight
maybe yeah so obviously uh overestimated
my uh
my loads capacity
there's another softball I would have
failed
in terms of I couldn't get it all the
way to my butt right
um but I did a little bit of a like a
little bit of a shrug kind of thing or I
popped my hips a little bit to get the
weight up
should I have not done that and just
kind of cut it or like yes yeah good
question so in the future correct yeah
we count it today but you also know that
no more reps in the tank after that no
so I would say that you probably could
have gotten it anyway if you hadn't done
the schwag if you just fucking tried a
little bit before okay but which is why
I'm not gonna be like that was just
fucking 12 and not 13 man yeah yeah but
yes in the future generally get it done
with this clean of a technique as you
can within reason I think I was just
thinking like get the weight up get
rather than like yes prioritizing the
technique first I prioritize getting the
rep first you're saying prioritize the
technique first and then the Reps will
happen or they won't or they won't yeah
okay all right
[Music]
oh
[Music]
gosh
let's go Mike come on
how many 15.
full stack in it too full stack you know
they say you beat the machine and you
get the full stack however many sets it
takes to get 15. well cool yes okay
[Music]
go 11 slow
all the way down
[Music]
finish finish
yes
as if another
all the way down stay with it
[Music]
get out for a sec
five seconds relax three left that was
12.
[Music]
slow
[Music]
on rack
rest a bit one more left take this thing
take some time with this one Jeff while
one good rep
go yes yes finish slow
fuck yeah
that's it
oh that hurt me watching let's go yeah
do I can do give me a Canadian let's go
come on that's Jordan Peterson what are
you doing if you're not leg curling
I even trying you ready Crystal yeah
yeah
accelerate on the ascent
yes
go come on
eleven one more one more one more
[Music]
twelve slow
unwrap
[Music]
rest
hit it
wrestle let's go
yes slow
slow control and you're done
oh
[Music]
my God
that was great I'm glad I'm not the only
one who uh like likes to grunt when
things get hurt because you do that too
now I feel better
yeah otherwise I totally stand back and
if nobody yeah I know it helps me too it
gets harder from here right yeah yeah
yeah
thank you
next exercise is the hack squat but not
just any hack squat the Atlantis hack
squat they plucked it right out of the
wreckage of Atlantis in the ocean it is
a superlative machine it is the
smoothest thing you will ever use in the
gym it's unbelievable that's a great
thing from a muscle stimulus perspective
because the eccentric loading can be
really really hard and on the way up
it's so smooth the concentric loading
isn't much harder which allows us to
really really really get an unbelievable
stimulus because you want a smooth
machine that doesn't reduce The
Eccentric it doesn't increase the
Concentra too much one it's much
eccentric as possible for the conceptual
getting Atlantis is where it's at Super
for range of motion as always probably
three sets here again and a 20 maybe 15
to 20 repetitions we're gonna do Maya
reps here so everyone that is doing this
machine today is going to get a two Maya
rep pause with every single set it's not
fire at match it's just you get in and
even the first set you do as many as you
can rest at the top five seconds or so
do as many as you can resting again just
as many can rack so it's really three
sets but it's nine approaches to failure
brutality is Among Us let's get it going
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
there's more reps coming
[Music]
up
go Jeff breathe
one more rep and you're done
[Music]
big moves

two plates yes and then you will learn
what hell really looks like
in a good way
let's go come on
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
good speed
[Music]
nice
[Music]
good job man that's a lot of rap
[Music]
well done oh thanks Joe incredible you
sure I want to I'm gonna get a lot of
reps with two that's the idea Joe I got
16 reps how do you time your breathing
because I find with the slow negative in
the pause I I do get a little bit
light-headed yeah you just fight through
those High Reps you just keep breathing
just before you get to the bottom okay
and then come on so you're doing a kind
of a double breath sometimes on rep
triple four okay okay okay okay
because I was trying to do the power
lifter uh valsalza the whole way and I
was starting to lose you're going to
pass out and trying that shit so I'm
listening for rest pause and rap yes and
that's it and I'm gonna control the
negative yes and I'm gonna pause for
about a second yes okay quality better
to make a rep harder than easier
Russ

[Music]
I promise I'm not trying to be dramatic
I just can't walk right now
[Music]
I can't uh think quite so good these
days my think back my leg ow
oh God
last exercise for the day gives me Roger
squat I don't know what's written on
here but it's called a Roger squat it's
like a Smith machine Can Have Anything
written on it still a Smith machine who
are the fuck Roger was the boy blew it
out of the water it's an amazing piece
of equipment it lets you freeze squat
you really don't have to focus on where
the positioning is you get to grab
anywhere you want on a machine that's
really comfortable and just go to town
my big recommendation here is to stay as
upright as possible let your knees flare
forward as possible as long as your
heels are still on the ground the range
of motion for your quads is amazing we
are going to take one to two second
bottom pauses it's going to be awful
pain
[Music]
chest up
yes
10 rest breathe
breathe
hit it
big chest knees forward arch your back
[Music]
push through your legs it's going to be
harder but better for you

foreign
95 also don't go easy on me trust me
it's not easy this is going to be really
really hard all right but I want you to
do 20 reps okay and I want you to stay
there until you get 20. all right this
is going to be off the plate so it's
going to be ultra depth I want you to a
weightlifting style open everything up
all right notice how this pushes my
quads out yep quads out chest up all
right push up instead of back
if your quads are hurting you're doing
it right yeah
oh I'm doing it right
full one second pause at the bottom I
want those quads to peel apart
[Applause]

sec Jeff

[Music]
that's the workout man you did fucking
amazing man thank you man you didn't go
easy on me no Jeff what'd you think
about the RPI purchase free workout
um
honest thoughts no please be dishonest
the leg curls were really fun
the hack squats were
fun
the last exercise was gruesome gruesome
yeah
um I think at that point I just hard to
describe it it's like um it's like
extreme burn in the muscle yeah but it's
just really uncomfortable and yeah
unenjoyable yes
um but apart from that it was great
awesome yeah
you know for you masochists out there
even that part's the great part folks if
you're listening to this whenever Scott
the video guy decides to release it who
knows the RPI virtual fee app will
either be in the beta you sign up for it
and get it for a cheap period or the
beta period where it's already outpaid
beta so you can go buy it the link will
be in the description and uh listen
it'll hurt you but in a good way see you
guys next time
[Music]
thank you
