hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
producation weekly tip number 32 if
you're keeping track
detecting and perfecting the pump
last week we detected and perfected the
mind muscle connection one of the
pillars of the raw stimulus magnitude
basically a way of figuring out are we
in the gym doing a good job to stimulate
muscle growth and the rust in this
magnitude is composed of the mind muscle
connection remember from last week
tension and burn the pump and the
disruption that the muscle actually is
sort of put through now
why does the pump have to do with growth
yes arnold said all those things what it
was
coming all the time yes uh he did say
something almost exactly that effect was
he right or wrong you know in the 80s
and 90s it became fashionable to say
that the pump is just blood in the
muscle that has nothing to do with
growth turns out that was bullshit so
there is direct mechanistic evidence of
cell swelling
actually causing
cell growth
wow all taken
the
biggest pumps
that you have
the essentially if you get the biggest
pump of your life training let's say
biceps the way to get the biggest pump
often correlates with going the closest
to failure so if you go really close to
failure and you're trying not to get a
pump you're going to have a difficult
time
the biggest range of motion
right if especially you do a real big
stretch and a huge super rom that's
going to get you a gnarly pump
the most volume if you don't get a pump
from one set you'll probably get a pump
from three or four sets
and of course the most metabolites if
you get a crazy burn
you get a burn during the set between
sets that pump is coming on strong
notice
close to fail biggest rom of the stretch
most volume most metabolites
those are all things that have been
proven in the literature to be
correlative or causative of hypertrophy
and they all correlate really well with
a pump and the pump itself causes growth
and it correlates with a ton of other
things so it's a pretty good proxy
measure so if you get a great pump from
a workout is it a guarantee that you're
going to cause muscle growth no but if
you have one workout that for let's say
your quads causes almost no pump and
another one that causes a psychopump the
cycle pump one probably gonna cause more
muscle growth nine times out of ten so
if you know how to detect a pump and you
know how to perfect the pump
you're probably well on your way to
engineering a system of training in
which you can
not guarantee but increase the
probability of growth isn't going to
occur and by the way
two other things
metabolites like lactic acid for example
mechanistically have been shown to cause
growth directly so the burn that causes
the pump
that has been shown to actually cause
muscle growth awesome and in at least
one recent study that's very curious
the folks at the beginning of the study
that got the biggest pumps through the
rest of the study grew the most muscle
so people that get big pumps from
training tend to grow the most from
training and that's probably not by
accident so
we want to perfect the pump we want as
much pump as possible how do we do that
well
the first goal is you got to be able to
figure out how to
actually detect the target muscle pump
and that takes some time beginners can't
do it remember beginners just focus on
good technique which is our first
foundation of actually getting a good
pump have good technique because if
someone
is squatting a third of the way down and
they're like oh i can't really get a
pump in my quads like motherfucker watch
this you teach them how to squat all the
way down a couple sets of ten later
they're like i can't move my legs i'm so
pumped i can't fucking bend my knees
you're like ha ha excellent right
lots of people can't tell when they're
pumped and that takes a while
and it takes a few weeks for some
muscles and a few years for others i
used to not be able to tell if i had a
back pump like lats and shit man
probably until i was like seven years
into training i was mostly a power
lifter that time but like started
training back with lap hold downs and
bent rows i knew what good technique
generally was i just had to kind of take
it on faith it takes a while to figure
out if you're pumped especially if shit
back there you can't see right
and because pumps are caused mostly when
you get closer to failure if you can't
push hard to failure or very close
you're not going to be causing a lot of
pumps so first of all have good
technique and second of all someone's
like you know i don't really get a big
pump dude lag process you're like
let me see you do the leg press they're
doing a quarter of the way down stopping
10 reps in reserve like okay teach them
how to leg press all the way down push
them close to failure on one or two sets
and they're like oh my god my quads are
going to burst like overcooked hot dogs
now we're talking so first good
technique then ability to push close to
fair
goal number two is to get to a place
where for all the fundamental exercises
that you normally do with your
techniques
you
learned how
to do them in such a way that maximizes
the pump not and maybe the super heavy
ones but certainly in
shit that is 10 reps and above to get
the biggest pump that you can
grip positions etc it's okay like this i
don't get a big chest pump but like this
i get a huge chest pump like this i get
a fine chest pump but when i arch them
or try to get a big one stuff like that
there are some generalities we can talk
about but a lot of it's just
individualizing to ways in which you
know exercises that give you the best
pump and so on and so forth and there's
a lot of technique there that figures
that out
[Music]
hey do you want to like go on a date
with me
okay
hey
we're going on a date cool
yeah
[Music]
on that note in goal number two you can
also optimize nutrition recovery you'll
notice that if you're tired let's say
you didn't sleep well last night same
workout not that great of a pump you'll
also notice if you're dieting if you
didn't eat a lot of carbs yesterday and
a lot of food in general you don't have
a good pump and remember sleep and food
are hugely correlated and causative of
training so all this dovetails really
nicely into itself
if you get lots of carbs
and plenty of sleep the day before
and the morning of or something like
that of training you're in for a fucking
garlic pump if you do everything else
right goal number three to become a jedi
master of the pump
is to be able to cause
and detect and cause more of a robust
pump in pretty much all sessions for the
target muscle that means you could go to
a new piece of equipment new gym and
know exactly how to rig everything to
get a gnarly pump
and a really advanced thing is to detect
a pump that based on experience is just
about the biggest one you're going to
get and stop training right then and
there because in my experience and the
experience of lots of the folks that i
collaborate with and train with
once you have a really big pump if you
continue training hard after that's
already the case and just keep pounding
that muscle you're actually causing a
crapload more damage but that damage is
so excessive it starts to compete with
the muscle growth itself it's been shown
time and time again and in multiple
studies that your cell can recover from
a certain amount of damage and perform a
certain amount of growth but the basic
molecular machines that do damage
recovery and growth modulation are the
same so if you do a crap load of damage
it actually costs you on the growth end
because there's not as much molecular
machinery to do the growth process
so what you want to do
is let's say you're having a great chest
workout you're planning on doing eight
sets of chest let's say the week before
you had seven you do six sets of chest
and your shit is bursting out of your
fucking body like holy fuck my
recommendation is just stop end the
workout six sets is good enough because
once you get a maximum pump if you
continue to train much longer for after
my prediction is you will grow less
muscle accumulate more fatigue than if
you just quit it
yeah having an awesome pump is great and
it's awesome because as soon as you get
a big pump just fuck off or go to the
next body part muscle group you don't
need to go and pound the shit into
oblivion i know some folks they get
their biggest pump and they continue to
train and the pump starts going away
don't do that that's not going to
promote a whole lot of growth
folks that's it for next week we'll see
you next week in this series to talk
about the last ingredient of a huge raw
stimulus magnitude and that is
disruption scary spooky see you then
