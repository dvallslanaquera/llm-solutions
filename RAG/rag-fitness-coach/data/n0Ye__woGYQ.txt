hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization hypertrophy concepts and
tools
17. holy crap we're way into this series
choosing and changing your exercises
good thing is we have a huge framework
laid down for this already
with the raw stimulus magnitude sfr str
concepts but here we're going to layer
them in
with some other concepts and really
figure out how to figure out which
exercises to do
and when to change exercises so
we're going to review the fatigue and
stimulus proxies rsm sfrs
tr str we're going to talk about the
effect of exercise stainless on the
indices
then we're going to address how to
choose movement velocity variance like
how slow to do the
eccentric for example we're going to
talk about loading range compatibility
some exercises don't go so well if
you're trying to train really heavy
versus really light
we're going to set up a deletion and
replacement guide which is super awesome
just a four part checklist of
whether or not to keep an exercise in
the rotation for the next meso
or to delete it and replace it with
another and then we're going to talk
about
how many exercises a super common
question to do per session
for a muscle group per week
and promeso we can measure the same
answer because every uh
week we repeat the same exercises for
mezzo
and then lastly we're going to talk
about how to structure exercise order
after this you're going to be able to
fill in a lot of blanks for
program design so
the rsm sfr str sftr all these indices
tell us how effective or efficient
exercises are
you want to rank all of those pertinent
to you all of your exercises for example
for quads you want to have a ranking of
all the highest ones on all of these or
you know at least sfr
and you're going to choose the more
higher ranking more often like if you
know leg presses are a huge stimulus to
fatigue ratio for you
for quads but lunges are really really
bad you know you probably aren't going
to choose lunges first you're probably
going to go to leg presses more often
than not so when you're deciding which
exercise to program
you look and see what the top of that
list is and you're going to go there
right that's really most of exercise
selection right there
a lot of times people ask myself and
others on instagram for example where
it's just not a really good platform for
um
a lot of answering in depth let's say
hey you know which exercises should i
pick for my leg routine or which
exercise did you recommend for triceps
and really the shortest answer is
whichever ones have the highest
sfr or if they're like i'm really time
constrained whichever ones have the high
str
that's really it right that's the
simplest answer everything else is
really just
uh more of a modification and a layering
on top of that right
really cool thing about these indices is
just by the indices alone
they can tell us knowing when to change
exercises not just which ones to pick
but when to change them how do we know
that
well once you do an exercise
for a certain length of time beyond when
it's no longer as fresh
it actually becomes less stimulative
right you're not getting as much
of a mind muscle connection the burn is
tougher to get it takes more sets
you don't get as much of a pump you
don't get as much disruption and as much
soreness
so you know months and months and months
and do the same exercise
your stimulus starts to go down okay
interesting right
that means that not only does your raw
stimulus magnitude fall for that
exercise
but the sfr goes down and the str and
the sftr go down because
when everything else is equal and
stimulus goes down
all those indices start to perform more
poorly so basically if you've been doing
leg presses for like forever
all of a sudden they're not that
stimulative and all the indices start to
fall
which means other exercises compared to
them might start to look better and
might have higher index rankings right
so you can say okay well leg presses
aren't stimulated for me anymore
but i'll just do more sets well if you
do more sets yeah you can prop up your
raw stimulus magnitude
but your str will drop a ton because
you're getting really inefficient
and of course more sets means more
fatigue so even your sfr could suffer
so stainless is a real thing but
remember stimulus is two components
exercises become less stimulative and
they also become more fatiguing
so if you do leg presses for example for
way too long your joints and connective
tissue start to wear down
the exercise gets really boring unless
it requires a bit more effort to perform
every set you know
if you're doing boring training you
really feel like you're trying harder
and it wears on you more psychologically
than if you have really really
fun training exercise relatively novel
then it's really sustainable because
you're always super pumped to go in and
your psychological fatigue is not as
high
so as you do exercises for too long they
not only become stale with a raw
stimulus magnitude falls
but also their uh fatigue rises
which screws every single index
completely especially the sfr and the
sftr
right so when an exercise is no longer a
stimulative and more fatiguing than it
used to be
we can say that it is becoming stale but
how do we know when something is stale
enough to switch
and it's actually a really easy answer
here let's say your sfr
for leg presses is usually like an eight
all right
or it's a really high number it probably
wouldn't wouldn't do that again
unless you're you know fatigue was
really low let's say uh sfr for leg
presses
usually three right and for hack squats
it's usually
uh 1.5 okay the good exercise hack
squats but
you know leg presses just generally have
a better sfr for you
sfr is going to reflect how much
stimulus drops and how much fatigue
rises over time
so after a couple of measures of doing
leg press and having roughly three
for an sfr it starts to go to you know
2.5 and then two
and then 1.5 and then one okay so once
your leg presses so far hits one
which is really severely degraded from
what it used to be your hack squat sfr
is at 1.5 it's officially higher so when
you create your next mezzo and you think
which exercise should i pick
lead press or hack spot if you choose
left brush you're willfully choosing an
exercise with a now lower sfr here's the
good news
if you choose hack squat do that for a
couple of mesos until it's sfr
goes down to one or something like that
by the time it's it got three mesos in
and it's not so far went from 1.5 to one
not the best training you could have had
but
the best alternative your leg press has
been so refreshed
like you haven't trained in a while
local like micro injuries have healed
psychologically ready to go again it
might be back up to a three or even
higher
then you switch the leg press milk it
out as far as it will go and switch to
hack squat like press hack sweat leg
press if both of them are really stale
at some point you might switch to
barbell squats as number one so on and
so on and so on so basically usually
you'll have a couple of exercises that
are really similar
similar really similar in your sfrs
right they'll be like two or three each
and then if you overuse one for a little
which is totally fine
it's going to dip significantly below
the other two or three
you pick one of those or two of those
put it in for a while and milk them out
until they dip
and automatically replace it's a
self-solving problem and if you
pause the video right now and look at
the screen there's another example on
the screen for you
uh written out with barbell rows really
really really straightforward
right so in effect a lot of exercise
deletion and replacement and we'll have
some more guides to it later
is really just monitoring your indices
and making sure you're honoring them
like if a certain exercise is really
scoring total dog shit on the sfr
and you're still putting it in and
there's other exercises you know
for that muscle group that are better
sfrs why are you still doing that
exercise
who knows stop doing it start doing the
other ones
right next how do we pick movement
velocity variation well
there are two basic rules for repetition
cadence
first is all reps have to be controlled
at least on the eccentric somewhat
so you don't fall into a rep in
hypertrophy training you control it now
it could be fast control
and it could be slow control but it has
to be under control the concentric you
can push as fast as you want you can
even
do a little bit of a change of direction
no big deal but the eccentric has to be
controlled for safety
and for effect remember if you have an
uncontrolled eccentric you're not even
contracting your muscles during that
time you're missing
a bunch of the growth stimulus from that
right and number two
so the first part is controlling
eccentric number two is the sum
total of the centric isometric and
concentric the whole
rep the whole rep cycle from start to
finish the sum
total can be no longer than about nine
seconds after that you're just the
load you have to use becomes so small
it's not efficient
or sorry it's not effective sfr for
hypertrophy training anymore not nearly
as effective so
your reps are between about one second
and nine second in duration
you're totally good to go that being
said so so basically at some fundamental
level it doesn't really matter what rep
cadence you use however
slowly centrics and meaningful longer
pauses
have their place in a couple of
different scenarios first it's just
variation you might just be like
board slash tired stale of using the
same thing
and all of a sudden instead of doing
normal pull downs you do pause pull
downs with a slow eccentric phase
totally fine to do just for variation
absolutely if one if the pause slow pull
down
has a better sfr for you now because
you've used the regular pulldown for too
long
totally find a switch for that reason
but there are a couple of others one
coming back from injury when you come
back from injury slower eccentrics
both work interestingly as a rehab
modality and also decrease
their peak spike forces when you change
directions or drop really quick
and they re they risk re-injury much
lower when dieting down and wanting to
avoid injury sometimes you're guided
down you're super dry
and you're super uncoordinated because
your neural fatigue is crazy
sometimes maybe doing some slower
eccentrics because they're
pretty much just as effective as a
regular exercise but a little bit less
risky just a little
you might want to do that towards the
end of a diet last couple weeks
milk the slow centrics just to play on
the safe side it's not always how you
should be training but it's definitely a
fine option then
and sometimes if you really have problem
with a mind muscle connection on an
exercise
you can use slow eccentrics to really
help find that better
with a peak contraction so for example
if you curl and normally you just curl
like this
if you curl and squeeze at the top you
can start to connect to your biceps
better which means the rest of the curl
becomes more tension generating in the
bicep itself
right you can focus more on the stretch
so instead of doing cable flies or
dumbbell flies when you come down and
come up
sometimes you can milk the bottom
stretch
and then come back up and it really
allows you to connect with the muscle
really produce a ton of tension through
that target muscle
maybe even position your biceps and arms
better to get them more out of the way
and get more pec
involvement right because when you're
going slower and especially this last
point here are just a slow eccentric
you can target the target muscles better
right
if you're zipping your leg press up and
down up and down up and down up and down
someone's like hey is that you training
quads you're like i guess i'm just
trying to get through the reps
but if you have to slow the eccentric
down you can tell when you're more glute
dominant or
more quad dominant you can tell how to
put force in your quads because you've
got
three seconds per rep of like yep this
is definitely messing up my quads
versus three seconds prep of like man i
definitely just feel this in my glutes
now that i'm slowing it down so
slowly centrics and pauses have their
place there
if not just for variation
loading range compatibility so we've
chosen so far exercises and all these
other variables
now we get to a little bit of a bump in
the road not all exercises
are best used in all loading ranges
right this is kind of a junior league
mistake
in exercise selection where you say oh
man i got sets of 20 to 30 according to
my plan
i'll do squats that's a problem why is
it a problem number one accident limited
exercises
exercise is limited by your ability to
stay upright i was going to say
stay erect but that's you know oddly
sexual i'll just leave that in there
if you have to stay upright and you have
to use your spinal erectors to keep you
there
a lot of times they'll fatigue way
before the actual target muscle does
so are you going to do shoulder presses
with a standing barbell set up
for sets of 20 to 30. man
even for sets of 10 plus it's just a
back exercise at that point
right because you're so much effort to
stay upright like that and not collapse
deadlifts stiff-legged deadlifts
sometimes even
you know heavier squats uh you know with
a lower bar setup especially god that's
really just a back workout at that point
limited much more by your
uh axial ability and not the target
muscle itself
for 10 plus reps probably not the best
idea
another limit is systemically limiting
exercises
may not be best for 20 plus reps so in
squats
you may have a good high bar setup and
it doesn't really tax your back a whole
lot if you go okay texting my quads i
can do
sets of 10 to 20 reps totally true but
for 20 plus reps squats end up being
limited
by your cardiovascular ability which is
systemic right
it's not that your quads are close to
failure it's you can't breathe anymore
and you end up having a weight between
reps
and you do another rep why are you
putting so much effort in the systemic
ability to keep breathing
you could just lie down on a leg press
you don't have to keep yourself upright
anymore you don't have to support tons
of active muscles
just the quads and maybe a little bit a
little bit of the glutes and now you can
do
sets of 20 to 30 reps and be limited by
the quads themselves
right so if you have accident limiting
exercises probably best not to do them
for
10 or more reps 5 to 10 is their rep
range systemically limiting exercise
especially cardiovascular
probably best not to go over 20 reps
with those on the other hand point
number three
single joint exercises a lot of times
uh maybe it's not super safe because
there's no other joint coming to the
rescue to do them
with very very heavy weights in the 5 to
10 rep range or anything lower than 10
reps and sometimes it's just not the
greatest mind muscle connection because
your body won't even let you generate a
ton of tension with a single muscle at
the same time so for example
uh laterals uh if you're doing a
dumbbell laterals with the shoulders
for sets of five to eight jeez
it might just like hurt your shoulder
joint a lot and just get you a whole lot
of nothing for the
the side belt and then for leg
extensions you know sets of five to
eight on my extensions
if you really want to produce a ton of
force with your quads
you've got to press stuff be it hack
squat leg press
lunge or squat that's how you produce to
produce a ton of force
there's probably a mechanism going on
there maybe involving the gold you tend
to organs where
when you try to produce a ton of force
extending there's just a certain cap to
how much your quads are going to be
turned on
not a problem when it's higher reps you
go into fatigue going to failure or
super close
sets of you know 10 plus especially 20
plus reps great
but like very few people do sets of five
to eight on the leg
extension and get off the extension
machine like that i'm just blasting my
quads i don't know about that
right you're probably just not
activating them enough to really really
get a good workout and also that can
cause
some pretty nasty knee pain because a
lot of those forces are a little
too high to have not distributed through
multiple joints right
so you might switch out exercises that
are otherwise good
sfr if the upcoming phase is not
compatible
right so uh you know if
you had a quad sfr
was really uh high for squats in the 5
to 10 rep range and then 10 to 20 rep
range
if you run the stimulus and fatigue
calculations
for when it's in the 20 to 30 rep range
you may find your stimulus is much lower
because the target muscle mind muscle
connection sucks because you're so
aerobically stimulated right
and thus your sfr might actually change
based on rep range
you have to find the appropriate rep
range on the other hand if you do leg
extensions versus a five to eight
your sfr might fall because the fatigue
the joint fatigue is so high
and the stimulus is so low again sfr
calculation
solves this problem but just be aware
that not all exercises are good for all
times
you want your actually loading exercises
and systemically fatiguing exercise to
be in the lower ab ranges
and you want your more isolation
exercises and single joint exercises
usually to be in the higher rep ranges
there are certainly exceptions to that
that's just the average rule to help you
choose exercises
here's where this is all going super
handy dandy exercise deletion and
replacement
guide okay we break down the indices and
we get a lot of wisdom out of them and
here it is
formally summarized how do you know if
you replace an exercise in the next
amount of cycle
or if you keep it first question are you
hitting pr's
if you're continuing to get stronger in
exercise that's not the only thing that
matters
right because if you're getting stronger
but your joints are falling apart
probably to change it
if you're getting stronger and hitting
br's and exercise if nothing else is
going wrong
you're going to keep that exercise real
really big deal real big positive so
if you're hitting pr's on the exercise
you're off to a real good start
next is the exercise hurting you at all
do you have joint and connective tissue
wear and tear
if like after three months your knees
feel 100 fine on the leg press and
you're hitting leg press pr's
it's a really tough cell to be like time
to trade out the leg press for hack
squat i don't know man you're making
pros
things seem great prs are really sort of
in in some sense direct evidence of
already occurring muscle growth not not
predictive muscle growth for stimulus so
you're on a real good thing
probably don't stop right but on the
other hand if you're not hitting pr's
mad sign and if your knees hurt or
whatever it's probably time to trade out
the exercises look for something else
if there's not other another solution to
the problem
last one is the exercise feeling still
or not relative to its alternatives
right so even if you're hitting pr's on
the hack squat
and it's not super hurting your your
joints you could be like well you know
it's sfr isn't that great anymore and
leg press is on deck it's ready
you don't want to just change out every
mesocycle but you know every few
mesocycles one of the exercises will be
clearly advantageous over the other then
you might want to change
because people say well don't change the
exercise unless you have to
totally but uh you know if one exercise
just clearly has the best sfr
uh already because it's so not stale why
are you leaving it on the back burner
still you might
want to bring it in and use it for what
it's worth right
so yeah you know it's someone like
orders pizza all the time
and barely ever gets chinese and all of
a sudden they really start craving
chinese
uh but they don't hate pizza yet you
know and they're ordering with their
significant other like what are we gonna
have tonight for our cheat meal honey
and you know she's like oh how about
chinese you're like well no hold on you
know pizza is still good like of course
it's still
good you don't have to wait till pizza
tastes like shit in order to get chinese
food you just have to have chinese food
be like something you definitely crave
more
and then you get away from your usual
standard of pizza same idea right we
it's that uh exercise stainless is
relative but relative doesn't mean
mysterious it means relative to other
things if those other things are clearly
better it's probably time to switch
or certainly can switch you don't have
to right lastly
super uh little bonus point is the next
phase appropriate for this exercise
she's like oh i'm gonna do low bar
squats but the next phase is super high
reps ah
probably not a good idea right if you
can answer all these questions
you will get a yes no yes no yes no and
you just tally up the yes's and those
and at the end of the day it's a cheat
sheet for how to pick your next exercise
do you have to do this formally and fill
in the blanks no but you can just sort
of think about it a little bit and
if you think about it you're like
there's a clear obvious answer then yeah
then it's that's that's your answer
but if you're new to this or if there's
not an obvious answer
go through it formally right you have
all these slides right go through this
formally
and it might be like like a three to two
decision in favor of switching on an
exercise or in favor of keeping it
and then just follow the logic right
because you might not feel any way about
it like oh i'm not sure
you're not sure follow the math it's
going to get you there where you need to
go
every single time second
to last point the exercise number per
session
huge question and of course the next
question of per
a week and per meso how many exercises
should be doing so
the sfr of an exercise is generally very
stable for roughly three to five sets
because yeah the fatigue is increasing
and the stimulus is dropping set to set
a set for each exercise
but at the same time um you know your
mind muscle connection tends to get a
little better your pumps tend to get a
little better
so there are some mitigating factors
whereby sfr for an exercise is pretty
stable so you don't have to like
do one set of machine chest press and
then the next set you go on to dumbbell
incline
absolutely not like that there's a good
three to five sets of machine chest
press you can do or any other exercise
until the sfrs probably start to go down
to where another exercise is probably
beneficial right
and because we hardly ever need more
than 15 sets per session per muscle
group and actually more than that's
probably not a good idea
one to three exercises per muscle per
session is often best
four plus is rarely needed so a lot of
times you see
various bodybuilders doing five
exercises for quads in a session
that's just not the best idea in the
world that's probably not uh
ideal one to three is super good the
average person one to two
works super super well i rarely in my
own training for my
own folks that i work with do any more
than two sometimes we'll do three
four is basically a never practice
situation
here's the thing okay per session we got
it one to three
usually one to two what about within the
week how many exercises should we use in
the week well
we need to cover most of our muscle
function basics right
so for example we need uh
for triceps we need to get you know the
long head
as well as the other two tricep heads
and there are certain positions certain
angles where the long head doesn't work
as much and the other heads work
so you know there's some diversity for
example quadriceps you know they have an
extension function they have a
pressing function there's something
happening at the hip joint hamstrings
you know there's the leg curling
function and also the hip extension
function of hamstrings
so you know muscles definitely have
different components of different parts
and they sort of correspond to the
different movement abilities so you
should probably cover most of those
right
so so for example you know overhead
tricep work supine tricep work
and then rolling and vertical pulling
can also get the long head uh or sorry a
different example
um so overhead triceps and supine
triceps right so you probably do some
triceps like this or just try some
standing with a push down
you should also probably do some tricep
work overhead on average for most people
and then what about like back work
people always debate you know what's
better pull downs or rows for lats
just ridiculous debate there a lot of
times hitting a bunch of other muscles
too and hitting lats in a very different
way and we want both
so you gonna probably some rowing and
some vertical pulling
most muscles have only one to three
basic functions
so one to three exercises per week
should cover it
right so you know if you're doing quads
for example you can have
a situation where the quads are being
activated maximally
while the hip is very extended lunges
right you could have one where the hip
is flexed in a big pressing component
leg press or squat
and you could have one where the
exclusive knee extension is occurring
which is lag extensions if you do like
three of those per week
more than covers it really you don't
even have to do that many but that's
like the sort of extra credit bonus
point answer right
reusing exercises is totally fine you
can do incline barbell press monday
and you can do it again on wednesday and
you can do push-ups on friday that's
only two exercises but you should
probably do some variation there
for example in rep ranges right so you
maybe do sets of five to ten on monday
for incline press
sets at 10 to 20 incline press on
wednesday and then sets of 20 to 30 for
push-ups on friday that would work super
super well
can you do more exercise variations than
one to three yes but you got to make
sure not to burn out all your best sfr
variants so for example if you have
three really really good chest exercises
and all the rest don't really work on
their grapefruit or rather their sfrs
are much lower so you have three top
rather tied sfr exercises or one two
three and then
nothing and then this dog shit at the
bottom you don't want to do all three of
them in the same week
uh for the same meso because you know
five mezzos later you've got to trade
one of them out what are you going to do
is one of these dog shit one's going to
fill it in but it's going to be terrible
training
so maybe you want to do two exercises
heavy moderate same exercise light
different exercise
so for a whole mess you have one
exercise on deck that's not being used
and when whichever one of these two
exercises gets the most stale
you replace it with this exercise that's
fresh milk it out
and then the exercises that you're using
the other exercise that you're using
then they make it stale this one's fresh
again
you replace that and go back and forth
god have something on the back burner
to replace you don't want to use all
your best variants all at the same time
when bodybuilders do these crazy
routines where they're doing like all
the best exercises in one session i just
want to be like so what do you do
in three months god knows right who
knows nothing nothing good to rotate to
exercise order the real simple answer
here
it's whatever does best for the index
you're looking for so if
raw stimulus magnitude is what you're
looking for to accomplish
you want to place the exercises in the
order that will achieve the highest rsm
for the session which usually means
the highest raw stimulus exercises first
while you're fresh super super
straightforward
right so if you're trying to train your
back like crazy
and deadlift fuck up your back more than
anything else you're going to want to do
deadlifts first not last because you
want them fresh and you want to work as
hard as you can if they have the rosters
the highest frost stimulus magnitude for
your back in your case you want to put
them first and everything after someone
and so on
even if it's lowered so far because you
don't care you'll have to raw stim
sfr you want to place in a way that gets
you the highest
sfr for the whole workout which means
you might do some isolation exercises
before compounds to get the net so far
better
classic example leg extensions first for
five sets
leg presses after for five sets because
the leg extensions pre-exhaust your
quads for the presses
you know it's better to do your presses
first but they're more fatiguing
but if your quads are pre-exhausted they
still get a good workout for the
pressers
but the systemic fatigue is so low
because you did
you have to use less weight for the leg
presses now considerably it's not as
much stimulus but the weight is so much
lower the fatigue is much lower
so putting it leg extension then leg
press better sfr
sfr not rsm than if you have leg press
first leg extension after
so that might be something you want to
be interested in if you have sfr
you might be doing a little bit of
isolation before compound after
maximizing sdr super simple exercise
orders you put your highest sdr
exercises first and maybe just only so
almost always compounds first if you're
in a rush to get to the gym so people
say
they'll watch my videos where i do like
you know let's say a leg extension then
i'm going to a
leg press after and let's say is that a
good idea for me i train three times a
week for half an hour
absolutely not it's terrible idea get
roller extensions all together maybe do
some if you have some time at the end
squat first to leg press first much
better idea and of course sftr
placed in the order that generates the
highest sftr so
here are the final implications exercise
selection
should not be random it should be guided
by the indices
right an exercise replacement when it's
time to replace them should not be
random
it should be guided by the deletion and
replacement guide mentioned earlier
the exercise number you use should be
minimal because you want to conserve the
number of variants to rotate earlier you
don't want to squish a bunch of
exercises into a week
pointlessly overlapping you want to make
sure the exercises are
justified and lastly the exercise order
