you are back to high school set of six
with 185.
did you guys make me weaker I said
bigger not weaker
[Music]
YouTube what's going on I'm clearly Dr
Mike still despite my best efforts I
continue to wake up in this stupid body
with this ugly head that being said
Jared feather look at his Mohawk he's
great he's a guy Mo cock did that come
out wrong or very right anyway I was
real massive floating slip I want
whatever that is uh battery's not
included listen Jared feather is an ifb
Pro here is our man Ali now he caught us
out in the streets and he was like I'm
two things a competitive bodybuilder and
I'm Lebanese and I was like that means
you're gonna have to honor the legacy of
all the unbelievable Lebanese
bodybuilding Champions including Mr
Olympia's and he's like I'm so ready
y'all ain't even I ain't even playing
and I was like leg day and he was like
yeah and so here we are today this is
going to be a hamstring
focused in the beginning then eventually
quad focused on the end
High rep leg pain day of Doom I'm just
kidding buddy everything's gonna be
great don't tell him let's get into it
[Music]
what you were doing how you were like
pushing your hips down like this so you
can hold the stretch at the top that was
perfect a lot of people wanted to get to
the top it's going to Clank and they'll
just let all the tension off their
hamstring try to hold that deep stretch
on The Eccentric face at the top for one
second and forceful on the way down
seated hamstring curls sets of 10 to 20
reps we're gonna do Maya rep match
because why wouldn't what is my rep
match if you're new to the channel
you had however many reps you can close
to failure one or two reps away shot
even zero reps right at failure
we're gonna do that let's say he gets 18
reps
straight
rest two three minutes however long it
takes to get all the energy back
breathing normal next set begins he goes
pretty close to failure or two failure
let's say he gets 16 reps because he's
tired now he waits for five or ten
seconds finishes off the last two so
it's 18 on the first 18 on the second
third set however many many sets it
takes of five to ten seconds rest breaks
between the mini sets to get again to
18. so that could be like ten six two
brutal multiple approaches to failure
give a huge growth stimulus 26. let's
get to 30. down 27 slow
do it again slower slowly go slow slow
that's 28 one more good one
29 slow slow one last one finish up
strong touch
slow
slow slow hold
good release good shit
good shit man
how did I come up with this workout well
I sort of did but the RP training app
alpha build which we're testing right
now when you see this it'll probably be
out for sale it's keeping track of all
of our exercises it's telling us how
much load to use how many sets how close
to failure I love it and I built it I'm
not just a client I'm a customer I got
that whole thing wrong let's just go
train super lock excellent
excellent as the Reps get harder you
press yourself away so a big deal on
seated hamstring curl machines is as
much as the machine design allows
luckily this is a good machine they
don't come this good is to lock your
legs down into the PAD as hard as as
possible until it becomes so physically
uncomfortable that the pain of being
locked in is worse than the hamstring
pain why because you want maximum
stability you want the only thing being
trained and moving is the knee joint
ideally that also means that you don't
just lock in the thighs but you take
your hands usually and you press
yourself into the machine such that it's
pure stability for the legs and it's
nothing wiggling if I look at someone's
hamstrings uh training and I look at
them doing a seated machine and they're
wiggling around while they're doing it
that is no good people talk about energy
loss that's not how physics works but I
will tell you how Neuroscience works if
you are stable and locked in you can
gear in and produce fuck load of force
exactly to the muscle you want if you're
unstable your nervous system is like are
we even fucking doing something for real
here and it doesn't allow you to be as
strong with the movement get a stable
locked in as possible
tell him to turn off the gangster rap
just great violent shit and then get
into it speaking of which let's get into
it
25 keep it going
again 26.
let's get to 30. down 27 slow
do it again slower slow slow that's 28
one more good one
29 slow slow one last one finish up
strong touch slow slow slow
hold
good release good shit
good shit man I'm not burning don't be
full you've got veins crisscrossing your
shift so I'll use like a super
heavyweight bodybuilder here in Vegas
he uh what'd you win last year
um High Roller High Roller so he won the
High Roller last year qualified for
National shows and now he's kind of just
in an improvement season quote unquote
to uh hopefully do Nationals at the end
of the year
yeah if everything works out yeah
oh yeah
24. that was the perfect rep do it again
thank you
25. beautiful come on
26. let's go Ali get your shit together
27. one more and then you rest a little
bit
28 control
breathe for a second rest
last tune in let's go begin two and
you're done
great control again
resist me don't let me pull your legs
don't fucking do it don't fucking do it
and you're done hell yeah man
I'm still strong that was hard
got a little pump in your hamstrings oh
fucking massive pumping my hands all
right so our app our app has a question
for you how did your joints feel during
this exercise no pain low pain moderate
pain or a lot of pain just for your
joints not your hands no pain
no pain uh sorry it's gonna say no gain
I'm just kidding can you imagine it just
encourages joint pain all right we save
that and then uh it'll program the rest
of the shit hell yeah good stuff
foreign
[Music]
pump this fucking drastic before recess
holy shit yeah and we just started the
ship fellas three sets my rep match of
30 reps each done for the seated
hamstring curl at least hamstrings are
in a state of disarray
we're gonna use a smaller amount of load
do stiff like a deadlift with dumbbells
which I don't think we've ever done on
the channel have we stop the video die
it must be a first time first time for
everything I always say that's what my
uncle told me when I was four years old
what happened next I can't talk about on
the channel more technically outside of
a court of law in any case it's going to
be dumbbell stiff-legged deadlifts for
probably sets of 10 to 15 reps the focus
here is arching the lower back to
pre-stretch the hamstrings by tilting
the pelvis anteriorly
keeping your knees back pushing your
tummy out and slowly lowering to
lengthen the hamstrings at load
pain is the menu item and depth as deep
as you can go while still feeling it in
your hands with an arch lower back is
the key Slow and Low I'm sure shit glad
I am not Ali's hamstrings right now and
after this gonna it's gonna be a fucking
lawsuit with hamstrings are gonna sue
the rest of his body I didn't think that
through her I was never smart enough to
go to law school or school yes
yes go go go this ain't numbered 100
pounds more you got this all fucking day
big chest
butt back
big chest big chest big chest go
go
go one more and you're done
let's do it
cast up
come on man fuck back pause
up
[Laughter]
I usually warm up with a 50s right I
just fucking another level
try stop come on man let's go try stop
let's go try stop hold deep stretch up
yes come on two more and you're done two
more and you're done I know it fucking
hurts big chest big chest right here Sky
High chest
back back back
up come on go come on one more get that
chest into the sky or we won't count
them Ali one good one even at the bottom
your chest should be pointed completely
forward when you're holding that just
forward chest forward chest forward yes
yes good stuff dude
good stuff done
oh my man my man
good job again the technique like that
man that's really good oh fuck yeah oh
yeah oh but the fun is just beginning
the selectorized original
body Masters linear leg press hack squat
selectorized Smiggle dig thingamajig
beeble Bop
this is the OG amazing
machine type that has been recently
perfected by Atlantis with their model
this shit though as old as it is it's
like older than me
and I'm like a hundred or some shit it's
fucking good real good Atlantis is
better it's newer it's better engineered
but God damn this is a hell of a thing
for its time we are going to make sure
that Ali scoots in here at its deepest
possible setting that he is controlling
The Eccentric here's the thing about
this machine
it unloads the axial component the spine
crushing you barely feel
which affords US an opportunity to milk
that eccentric that slow lowering for
the quads to an extent that even Scott
the video guy called needlessly painful
now I hope Ali can't hear this hopefully
he's Far and Away off camera but this is
going to be Myra sets probably two rest
breaks sets of I don't want to say this
out loud 15 to 25 reps the quads are
going to be cooked this is all about
high quality full range of motion heel
stay down we'll clue you into some more
cues I honestly am scared to even
administer what's gonna happen let's go
oh that tension off
control control
Falls there yeah yes down slow slow God
damn it Ali slow slow slow up
and then as if you're gonna do another
one fucking extra slow slow right here
throw right here control
yes yes yes pick them out they're good
my head
that was a fucking set dude that slowing
down in that middle portion is because
it's essentially mechanically like the
most torque trans dude that's the
toughest part if you can slow down
during that part the amount of muscle
growth stimulus is like that's why we're
doing this exercise we're not doing just
to do wraps yeah you're doing an amazing
job as soon as your breathing is back to
relatively normal no rush no rush no
rush I'll hit it again yeah from like
from now on dude literally I don't even
think about refs anymore
to be honest yeah like on the set I
could get 15 I could get 20. I don't
know I'm just gonna keep my technique
fucking perfect come on go go go nobody
said rest we got two more control
[Music]
seven down slow slow Ali God damn it we
won't count these if they're not slow
[Music]
pause
up
rest breathe push through the heels
whenever you come up
four
it's gonna be harder
it's not a big deal
it's slow let's show the shields heels
on the way up up down
slow
control control
again again we don't give a fuck if you
go to failure slow slow control
no no good stuff that's it that's it
that's it
my man huh fuck yeah good shit man good
shit holy crap
dude that's great
that's like right when I start hitting
failure I noticed that
that middle part yeah I start to fucking
lose
the hardest part man let's do a downside
that's how I like to kind of regulate my
volume when I'm training if I fall out
of the rep range that I'm giving myself
for an exercise so like we said we
should get like 15 to 20 here you got 10
on that one I just go ahead and that's
when I program my down set yeah so like
I'll reduce the load by 10 20 and then
I'll get back into the rep range that I
was doing yeah instead of trying to
struggle with the same way exactly and
get seven five three reps yeah every rep
the same just like last set even though
it is lighter slow on The Descent solid
pause only rest at the top when we say
it's a break begin
one more slow oh yeah yeah
you're a fucking machine not fast oh God
damn it no no rest breathe we got one
more little mini set control your shit
stabilize breathe you're in charge
you're in charge I'll even want one or
two more bro as soon as you're ready
time to fucking wrap Lebanon let's go
slow
come on man fight it
heals fast come on one more last one
slow slow
zero victims here today I see Warriors
ah feels oh God damn it as if you're
gonna do another last rep of machine
slow slow you're in charge
oh that's it
oh shit
beautiful
we only have squats left how easy
a good luck
squats are not the quote unquote best
quad Builder right but you hear that and
people say it it's like you're huge you
could squat a fuck little weight
so whenever you pre-exhaust them but
doing a machine or something like that
first and then you come scroll down you
come Squad it's gonna be fucking no and
then the load is so reduced the axial
fatigue from it so like actually what's
going through the spine yeah and then
making you systemically fatigue
throughout the week you just reduce the
load it goes down by a shitload yeah so
you're not overreaching too soon 100
okay so you might only do like two
plates on this today it's totally fine
but I've seen you squat like what four
in the fours got in the five fours fours
for reps it's not really good I don't go
more than 405 yeah so now you won't go
more than four plates in total
Ali did three sets of sets of 10 to 15
roughly of uh hack squats his quads are
toast already he's a strong guy his
quads are enormous 250 pounds veins all
over his legs he is going to do 185
pounds for one set in the squat
probably something like five to ten reps
he is going to do 135 after because we
do not anticipate him being able to do
multiple sets at 185 just two sets of
squats here 185 135 hopefully he said at
10 to 12 on 135. as soon as he racks 135
he's gonna walk back and we're gonna do
the RP patented
drop set to bodyweight squats to failure
slash death
and uh that'll be it for quads and the
whole workout it doesn't take much if
you get the technique right even if
you're big you don't have to use crazy
heavy weights you can if you want but
you can use lighter weight do it
properly get stronger over time from a
lower position because the weights have
such a huge effect on the muscles
let's get into it we're making a set
let's go chest up chest up chest up
chest
up
up again
up go God damn it my man
rack
[Music]
that was fun
damn you are back to high school set a
six with 185.
did you guys make me weaker I said

let's go to 135 yeah yeah again we're
jockeying the chest at the bottom

do you think Telecaster
above my definitely way above my uh what
I was expecting fuck yeah I love it dude
you did amazing appreciate it the thing
that's most impressive about what you
did which is TBH no joke it's the gold
standard of the way we train and the way
we do our Channel training
a lot of people can train hard if you
just turn up the death metal just do
stuff
a lot of people can be technique
masterminds when there's no weight on
the bar and they're not close to failure
you took that hard as fuck training and
you paired it with excellent technical
attention and that slow control
when those two intersect the explosion
that results is enormous fucking quads
and hamsters I appreciate that dude
awesome stuff anytime you want to come
back on the channel train anything else
yep yeah uh you got social media and
shit like that oh yeah yeah there you go
