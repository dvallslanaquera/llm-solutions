i like can't get comfortable that's what
you get for having big legs
dude it hurts like no matter what i do
i was yeah i was having panic attacks
it's fine seriously
i woke up in the middle of night i was
like oh i got this tomorrow
hey folks dr mike here with
bree terry and she is allegedly
with top three 165 pound female power
lifters
of all time that's kind of insane so
she came up to me in the gym i had no
idea who she was and she was like hey
you you that full rom
rp strength guy dr mike whatever right
and i'm like yes
and she's like first of all i don't
think your training is that hard
specifically your leg training i think
it's bs not a lot of swearing in the
youtube intros because the algorithm
is not kind to us and she said a couple
more things she's like and not only will
i survive it
i will excel at it she said then the
following she said i am a warrior
i'm a queen i'm a goddess and at that
point she punched me in the face and
when i woke up
we were filming this video and her doing
legs with rp
interesting will she survive predictions
no
death comes on swift vulture wings
let's do it
folks first exercise is a stiff legged
deadlift
done bodybuilding style also known as
weightlifting style
we're going to make sure that she tilts
her hips
pre-stretching the hamstrings we're
going to make sure her knees are
hopefully not as hairy as mine but
almost locked out not locked out
not this shit right here somewhere in
between and we're gonna descend
until there's tons of pain in the
hamstrings big stretch she's gonna touch
the ground
we've arranged her grip so that right
when she touches the ground
is right when the hamstrings almost
start to lose tension and then she's
gonna come all the way up
a few sets of five to ten reps fast
twitch dominant muscle in most people
especially her
low rep training is great by the way
we're at the dragon's lair flex lewis's
gym
in las vegas it's amazing if you ever
come to vegas this is the place to train
i was not paid to say this but you know
what i'm saying flex if you want to pay
a motherfucker to say that shit
you know i'm in for some money deep and
up
don't lose tension at the bottom slow
the entire time gentle touch
gentle and up and one more
big chest slow gentle touch
and up and down just the way you're
gonna do another but you don't
and that's it good
cool yeah what do you think about uh
challenging five to ten
sure how much weight do you think we
need another 25
i feel like if i put my belt on i could
probably do 315 for 5-10
it's crazy first work set belted up
just good old-fashioned work no need to
cycle no crazy shit
good technique good
nice and slow beautiful
good
up good you don't have to go quite that
slow
that's better gentle and up good
two more
gentle and up one more
big chest big chest big chest yes and up
good and then down as if you're gonna do
another and then leave it big chest big
arch
milk this last one out milk it milk it
milk it beautiful oh shit all right milk
this other one let's go
as long as they're a good technique you
keep going slow
good stuff holy shit very good very good
[Music]
i'm fine fine
nobody cares if you're fine you can tell
yourself that if you want
when does the workout start yeah that's
right good get that nice tight grip
take your time brie take your time
there's no rush for anything
everything is high quality technique
all right set it up there you go
excellent
stop beautiful that was the perfect rep
cadence
excellent again big chest
stop again
[Music]
slow gentle up
one more let's push it
great control gentle and up good
finish this one as if you're gonna do
another chest
up chest up no bullshit there you go
good stuff very good stuff
ouch that's not some warrior shit
uh that's it two sets here oh wow thank
god yeah you're saying thank god now but
what's next is harder so fuck all right
[Music]
breeze not dead from the stiff-legged
deadlifts and she got like a set of six
instead of five or something like that
somewhere in that low sort of low end of
a five to ten range really good
she's probably really fast twitch
dominant seeing as she's strong as shit
next is the squat high bar squat
bodybuilding style or olympic
weightlifting style
really focusing she's something she's
not used to here keeping the chest up
the pelvis tucked and exposing the quads
to the movement
they're gonna be pause squats sets of oh
around ten reps probably two three maybe
four sets we'll see how she does
after that leg press let's get to
squatting relax and get the work done
up one
[Music]
up two
up three good stop keep going
up four keep chest up
up good lower
sink it super deep big chest go
up good again
[Music]
up again
deep up strong more
come on bree let's go
control up
fuck two plates
goddamn i thought i was going to be
impressed but
i'm extra impressed brie has a huge
spinal erector pump because we did this
stuff like a deadlift earlier
and the heavy weight is what really gets
that thing going it's fine but the burn
is kind of preventing her from really
hitting your quads
so per her request we lower the weight
to something a little bit
more high rep but at the same time
something doesn't require as much
postural control
that'll put more of the emphasis on
quads less on the actual back
may not occur this way for everyone but
for her this seems to do the trick it
allows her to do more
quality work so we back down to 185 now
the
suffering really begins
good stay upright
up again now
up again now
up control the descent we're not in a
rush big chest
go
up again
up rest breathe you're strong let's go
more big chest slow
up three more and you're done let's get
it fucking done let's go
up warrior let's go
up queen let's go last one
up goddess rack good shit
good shit
[Laughter]
i called you a goddess and this is what
you do
lay down and die gods are immortal god
damn it
what's funny is people think jared
and charlie and i are being dramatic
when we're doing our legs and lying on
the floor
no you have just one more set here okay
yeah bodybuilding there's always
more up you're in charge do a great
genetic elite let's go
three more and you're done quality only
slow up
one
up one more
up
good stuff very good stuff
oh no leg press don't worry it's easy
at least i get to lay down that's cool
yeah that's true
yeah i like that part
[Music]
exercise number three leg press uh
free advertising this is an arsenal leg
press it's probably one of the best
leg presses ever designed a huge ability
to change
the plate angle or the back angle the
plate has a double angle which is
fucking awesome there's a little cast
thing on there too and
most importantly for our purposes and
shitty febri
it allows a massive range of motion so
we are going to do multiple sets of 10
to 20 repetitions mile rep style
which means when bri gets tired she
locks out rests two to five seconds
and then does a few more reps this is
going to be
fucking brutal but she's a warrior
goddess queen whatever bullshit she told
me earlier when she punched me in the
face
so we'll see how she stacks up let's get
it done just take a nice little position
breathe in on the way down breathe out
on the way up and you're golden wrap
these rep these reptis
i'll say rest when i say rest lock out
your knees be comfy
take some breath some breaths and i'll
say go again only when i say rack do you
rack
sound good yeah all right let's use that
athlete shit
let's tune in do a good job slow on the
descent

big stretch in your quads there's no
reason for us to be here

[Music]
rest two
let's go slow
up another go
and last one whenever you're ready that
means now
deep up
rack quickly stand up
stand over here
come over here face that way put your
hands in front of you like this
good wider stance toes out squat all the
way down and hold it for a sec at the
very bottom
go sometimes after leg press it's a neat
little trick to throw in there
usually when you really want to sort of
put an exclamation mark on a workout
we do some bodyweight squats after
normally bodyweight squats are super
challenging but because the leg press
pre-exhausts your quads near their
limits
every single repetition is super close
to failure
for the bodyweight squats is an extra
way to add a ton of really effective
quad volume
stimulus without a lot of systemic feed
because for the love of god it's just
your only fucking body
so give that a shot at home it only
works if you the last thing you did
toasted your quads
holy fuck dude good stuff
i like shit
i like can't get comfortable
you're what i can't get comfortable yeah
that's what you get for having big legs
preview i was standing over there i saw
her throw up
and i called my mom
super quick usually we don't recommend
calves at the end of a workout
but because her minimum effective volume
for calves is so low because she just
started training them
it's okay to put at the end of workout
if you're very very serious about calf
size
train them usually separately away from
your leg workout because right now
her systemic drive is really low because
she's super tired
so and she says she's fine nobody
believes that shit
um that's it let's go do cabs
we're gonna start and breeze gonna be
doing this just a quick demo for her and
for you guys full stretch
full contraction every single time it's
all about control
if you do this kind of dildo shit with
calves you're going to have dildo calves
like everyone else who does the shit
wrong
if you want big calves or bigger calves
all the way down
all the way up and for high reps use
that's a 10
20 sometimes 30 let's get to work all
right
high quality reps
great all the way down slow all the way
up
all the way down slow you let me know
when it starts to really hurt okay
up beautiful up
slow up painful stretch
yes and up good
up good
