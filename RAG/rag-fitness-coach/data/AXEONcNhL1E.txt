all right what's going on guys so in
this video i want to share some of my
recent thoughts about rpe
and address five of the most common
criticisms i've been hearing lately
starting with a recent video from jeff
cavaliere of athlean x where he labels
rpe
as a quote really poor excuse now let me
just start by saying that i do think
most of us creators here on youtube
actually have the same end goal we just
want to help people get the best results
we can
and it's perfectly fine with me if we
disagree about some of this stuff in
fact i think people
learn these concepts better when they're
part of an ongoing discussion so rather
than just lay out the reasons why i like
rpe
in this video i'm going to instead focus
on addressing some of the counter claims
that i've been hearing recently
starting with jeff's video now to be
clear only the first two criticisms on
my list come from jeff's video
and then we'll use those as a
springboard to address three other
common arguments that i've been hearing
lately
but first just to illustrate what rpe
means here are the last few reps on a
set of curls taken to an rp of eight on
the left
meaning i think i could have done two
more reps but terminated the set with
two reps in the tank and this is what an
rp of 10 looks like
on the right meaning i couldn't have
done another rep with good form
even with a gun to my head and the
purpose of rpe is simply that to
quantify how hard your set was
and just like it's useful to know how
many sets to do and how many reps to do
i think it's equally useful to know how
hard to push each set
and just as hard as possible or harder
than last time
isn't good enough in my opinion instead
i think rpe or rating of perceived
exertion
is the best practical tool we have for
tracking effort and remember
the act of tracking how hard your set
was is really no different than the act
of tracking how many sets you did or how
many reps you did just because you count
your reps doesn't mean you do high reps
or low reps
and it's the same thing with rpe
counting rpe doesn't imply you train any
less hard
it just means you're counting how hard
you're training just like everyone else
is counting their sets and reps
okay so the first criticism of rpe is
that it's fine for intermediate and
advanced trainees but isn't all that
good for beginners
and i think this was the main point of
the athlean x video and i completely
agree with jeff that it's a good tool
for intermediate to advanced trainees
and in fact it's pretty much ubiquitous
in the drug-tested power lifting world
at this point
so it's utility there is totally clear
and uncontroversial
but whether or not it's any good for
beginners i think is more up for debate
now the athlean x argument would be that
sense beginners are inexperienced with
training
they might not really know what an rp9
feels like or an rp8 feels like
and so you risk this scenario where they
say they're at an rp of eight or nine
but they're actually at an rp of three
or four and i actually think this
concern is understandable
in fact one 2017 study found that when
subjects were asked to take their
typical 10 rep weight to complete
failure
fully 47 of subjects were able to do 16
or more reps but to me this doesn't mean
we should discount our pe as a tool
even for beginners it simply shows that
most regular gym goers
don't push it hard enough on their own
but the solution here isn't to say
well forget about rpe because beginners
can't assess it accurately
instead i think beginners just need to
learn what an rpe 10 feels like
and then from there learn what it feels
like to leave one rep in the tank and
then
learn what it feels like to leave two
reps in the tank because it's not like
you're just going to wake up someday
and all of a sudden you're an
intermediate lifter and now all of a
sudden you can track rpe correctly
if you want to get better at using rpe
then you just have to reflect on your
set
and think about okay how hard was that
set really and i see no reason why a
beginner shouldn't do that
in fact i actually asked dr mike izertel
this exact same question a few months
ago
and he said that even if it is true that
beginners can't gauge rpe
as accurately it's still not a concern
because the intensity threshold for
beginners
is so much lower to begin with i don't
think that's an issue at all
who is it an issue for beginners what do
beginners not need to progress
training remotely close to failure they
just don't need it as a matter of fact
beginners need to focus on
excellent technical execution and just
getting incrementally stronger over time
and that's done best without training
super close to failure
only when your technique is really solid
do you sort of earn the right or get the
most productivity from training closer
and closer to failure
so if you're a new lifter or you're new
to rpe here's what i'd recommend you do
i call this an rpe test set so the next
time you're doing an exercise that you
can fail safely on
let's say an incline dumbbell press once
you get to a point where you think you
could do two more reps
call it out say out loud okay i'm at an
rp8 now
and then actually push it to failure to
see if you rated it correctly
yeah okay i think that's our key eight
yep
one more let's go
if you could only get two reps that
means you're dead on with your rpe
but if you got three or four more reps
that means you're probably
overestimating your rpe
and you need to push it harder next time
now at this point some people might be
thinking
okay beginners can use it but is it
really necessary for beginners
isn't this just overloading them with
too much information and i'm gonna get
to that criticism
in number five at the end okay up next
in the same video jeff noted that some
people are
hiding behind science and i think what
he means by this is that some people are
using science as an excuse to be lazy
some people are so busy trying to
fine-tune all the little details that
they forget about the basic idea of just
pushing yourself
and if this is what he means by this
then i completely agree but in my
opinion the answer here is to again
simply remind people that there is an
intensity threshold for maximizing
muscle growth and it's probably
somewhere around an rp of seven
maybe eight depending on the exercise
and your training experience
and if you're not pushing it hard enough
then you need to go harder but this
doesn't mean we should blame the science
science isn't telling you to go any less
hard in fact if you look at the
literature as a whole
science is telling us that many of us
probably aren't going hard enough
to remember that study from earlier and
in fact i would argue that once people
actually start paying attention to their
rpe their effort tends to
increase not decrease and that's because
it's quantitatively reminding you that
you actually need to be pretty close to
failure
and you've probably been stopping shy of
where you should be more often than not
now let me remind you here that going to
failure hasn't been shown to be better
for muscle growth in the research as a
whole
anyway for the most part studies find
mixed results
some studies find failure to be a bit
better for growth and some find it to be
a bit worse for growth
so going all out all the way to failure
clearly isn't the key
and likely is counterproductive in many
instances and this isn't to say it
doesn't have any place in training
i think it does it just isn't the be-all
end-all that some of the anti-rpe folks
can imply that it is
and that brings me to criticism number
three and again arguments three through
five aren't coming from athlean x so
he's off the hook from here forward and
argument number three is that rpe
or sometimes just science in general is
for [ __ ] it's done
by [ __ ] or it's done on [ __ ] and
while it's hard to take this as serious
criticism
i do hear it enough lately that i
figured it'd be worth addressing quickly
now i know ducette has said this in a
video and i've heard ripito say the same
basic thing about rpe recently
so when you have people in our industry
saying this sort of thing it's not
surprising that it started to catch on a
bit
but i'm here to tell you that it's
simply not true and i think people who
say studies are for [ __ ] or done
on [ __ ] frankly haven't read very
many studies now i'm not one to argue
for hardcore points
i just want to know what works best but
for one the training protocols used in
studies are usually a lot more hardcore
than you think
just look at this recent study from
bjornsson and colleagues out of norway
they had national level power lifters do
blood flow restriction training to see
if it could help with muscle growth
and just look at the protocol four sets
of front squats with 30
one rep max and the first set and last
set were taken to complete failure
with blood flow being restricted to the
legs this is puke bucket level training
and if you're one of those people who's
ever said studies are for [ __ ]
then i challenge you to do this on your
next leg day tell me how it feels and
tell me if it changes your mind
and i didn't cherry pick this one study
either this isn't the one hardcore study
i just happened to read it the other day
and that's because this type of
intensity
is actually very common in resistance
training studies as researcher chris
barakat recently explained
most studies simply have all subjects
just take every set to failure
to standardize intensity as a controlled
variable
every subject says this is the hardest
i've ever trained in my life
in the lab like the environment in the
lab is you have like six
other people in the lab at the same time
you're doing the same exercises so now
it becomes competitive
they always admit especially our lower
body studies like they're like i've
never trained my legs that hard
and it's like yeah well no wonder you're
gonna respond pretty well but then some
people might say
okay the studies are harder than i
realized but a lot of them are still
carried out on
inexperienced lifters so they don't
really apply to me
but i don't agree with this either
because for one a lot of studies like
the one i just mentioned
do in fact recruit well-trained subjects
and for the ones that don't
the reality is that most people are
still in the beginner to early
intermediate stage of training anyway
whether they think so or not and in my
experience most people
overestimate how well-trained they
really are so you probably have more in
common with the average study subject
than you think
and also this argument implies that
something fundamentally changes with
your physiology
when you go from beginner to
intermediate or from intermediate to
advanced
but this isn't really true either the
main difference is that your rate of
progress will slow down
but for the most part the same
scientific principles of what works for
muscle growth
applies across the spectrum of lifting
experience
in fact i would argue that doing studies
on beginners is actually a good thing
because it allows the research to
actually detect an effect
if we were only doing studies on
pro-natural bodybuilders we're so close
to our genetic ceiling that would be
really hard for the research to notice
any significant difference in a
reasonable time frame but if you can
find a significant effect in beginners
in eight weeks then it's reasonable to
assume
that you could also see an effect in
more advanced trainees it would just
take you longer to notice it now i don't
expect this to change the mind of anyone
who really hates applying science to
bodybuilding but for anyone who's
undecided maybe this will convince you
that science is yet another tool in our
toolbox
that can be very helpful when applied
properly and it doesn't need to be a
binary thing either
you can listen to what the experience
bros and coaches have to say and
also pay attention to what the science
is saying look at both curiously and
skeptically
and over time you'll find an approach
that works really well for you
okay criticism number four is a big one
and it's that regardless of training
experience
rpe isn't very accurate to begin with
now i hear this left and right so i
won't attribute it to
any one person but despite many people
saying it it also
isn't true the latest research shows
that experienced lifters are actually
very good at guessing rpe a recent study
by susan colleagues had 10 well-trained
lifters
call it when they thought they were at
an rp of six so when they had four reps
left and when they thought they were at
an rp of nine
on the squat bench press and deadlift
now on average subjects were only off by
one rep with the 6rpe and only off by
0.6 of a rep with rpe9
now generally for bodybuilding people
won't be training at rp6 very much
anyway
so the rp9 result is most relevant and
this study tells us that once you have
some lifting experience
you most likely know when you're at an
rp of nine and other data shows that the
more you practice this skill
the better you get at it okay and
criticism number five is that all of
this is just
too much information and i would say
that out of the five arguments i've laid
out here
this is the one i sympathize with the
most now i know some people think that i
over complicate training on this channel
and maybe i do sometimes but that's just
because i genuinely find the details
interesting
but if i were to go into the gym and
train a new lifter for the first time
the last thing i'd want to do is bog
them down with a bunch of little details
and a personal pet peeve of mine is when
trainers try to flex their knowledge on
their clients
rather than just explaining to them what
they need to do in basic simple terms
but i honestly don't think that rpe
falls into this category
it's an extremely intuitive concept you
just ask the client how many more reps
they think they could do
and to say that most beginners just
couldn't understand a simple one to ten
ranking scale
is kind of pandering in my opinion so as
i see it you just need to assess
each individual in terms of what their
training iq is and how
eager they seem to be to learn this
stuff and if they have a low training iq
and aren't particularly eager to learn
which is fine not everyone's as
interested in this stuff as you might be
then yeah you might want to keep things
as basic and practical as possible
and maybe instead of telling them about
this fancy term rpe right away
you can simply just ask them okay on a
scale of one to ten
how hard was that set could you have
pushed it harder did you push it
too hard and let your technique slip and
just get them thinking about how hard
they're training because
after technique how to apply appropriate
effort really is one of the most
important things to learn in the gym
and i think i'm going to leave it there
for this one like i said at the
beginning i do think that most of us are
just trying to get people the best
results that we can and if we disagree
about some of the methods that's totally
okay
by me um i hope that you guys found the
video helpful if you did don't forget to
leave it a thumbs up subscribe if you
haven't already and i'll see you guys
all here
in the next one the blood just like
running i noticed that that's crazy
just give me a second here got the guy
you want inside oh yeah i mean jeffy
it's [ __ ] pink bro pink
