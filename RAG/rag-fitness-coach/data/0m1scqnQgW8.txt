what is the date
today June 16th
17th
17th my mom's all right hey guys it's
June 17th today I woke up at 161 lb
yesterday I hit a new low of 16.2 so I'm
I have a feeling this week I'm going to
break into the 150s so today is refeed
day and look
how I'm really excited to eat these I
haven't had shredded hash browns since
Denny's
[Music]
so y okay guys so here's meal one I've
got those shredded hash browns zero
fat uh turkey bacon typical egg whites I
had just have some cold oatmeal and
water with a packet of Splenda for some
extra carbs this this morning 100 G of
blackberries and my lemonade and coffee
so here's my second meal I've got first
and foremost Orange monster got a
chicken and uh cheese lettuce and some
red pepper in there uh sandwich on whole
wheat Italian
bread and 100 G of strawberries so
pretty simple one exercise 5 to 8 and
then 8 to
and then 12 to 15 and then maybe minimum
of 20 up to 35 or her the rest of her
physique is so good that it like makes
her C like makes them Overlook how big
her calves are if that makes sense so I
think what's rewarded the most is like
slim looking calves but that are aren't
like sticks like I don't know how to
describe it but like not not Jeff Cavs
we just got off a two or three hour
Skype call with Progressive Fitness and
now I'm about to have some KD superfood
so for Greek yogurt I just have plain
Kirkland Greek yogurt uh the
macros are really good so we've got 18 g
of protein 6 G of carbs and zero fat in
175 G it's only 100 calories so this is
a really good way to get a lot of food
for very few calories and it tastes
really bitter on its own so what I do is
just add a couple packets of
Splenda and
um that's it and I just eat it like that
so I forgot to film The Last Meal but it
was basically uh two servings of crispy
minis whey protein and uh banana so it's
now 10 p.m. and I've been so busy um
writing programs and stuff all day that
I fell behind on Macros again so I'm
making a fluffer Nutter sandwich so now
I just basically Mash
that all around like
that so guys it's 10:40 now it's way
later than we would typically train um
I'm actually pretty tired but we decided
we would just go for a workout try to
get it done and since our normal gym is
closed we're going to go to
um I won't name the name of the gym but
we'll just buy a day pass there and um
get her workout
done

donuts I'm just tracking my
macros quite under for
today yeah je is the Hipster of tracking
macros and he has to do it on paper for
some
reason
well find that when I'm just incessantly
checking my fitness pal then I go to
Instagram then I go to Facebook then I
go to Twitter then I go back to my
fitness pal to do what I originally
planned to do and then at that point
it's 10 minutes that have passed and if
I just use paper I just track the metos
that I want to track and then it's over
so that's why I do that wrong and it be
a
hpster he's got a what is it sugar just
regular it's just a plain sugar dip
dut really good
