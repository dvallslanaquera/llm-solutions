organic is a nonsense term in the
industry that's supposed to mean earthy
and it technically means nothing at all
in chemistry organic means contains the
carbon atom in some capacity and since
your entire body and every food you ever
eat is going to be organic that doesn't
make any sense so organic's nonsense
processed does mean something it's the
degree of modification to food but there
are plenty of healthy foods that are
very processed like whey and Casi and
protein are processed to and
they're insane good for you and all
those little herbs and mushrooms you
take as pills the you know I'm saying
ashwaganda and that's great for you
too that is insanely process it's a
powder and it appears in a pill so most
of the time having minimally processed
foods is a good idea for your health but
that's always the case and a sure
has nothing to do with Organic which is
a waste of your money and a scam
