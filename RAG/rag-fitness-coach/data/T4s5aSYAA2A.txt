okay so this is my pre-workout meal I've
got a cup of egg whites one whole egg
some grated cheese on top I've got two
strips of turkey bacon and half a cup of
oatmeal and this has actually been my
standard breakfast for the last
Year too so today I'm actually gonna be
going for a workout with a friend of
mine who's local to the area he's had a
super impressive 140 pound weight loss
transformation you can check them out on
Instagram this is his username right
here you can check them out on YouTube
I'll put a link to his channel in the
description below but I think we're
going to be training upper body at least
that's what I have planned I'm not sure
what Danny's doing
um but first before I go there I just
want to give you guys a quick update so
since the photo shoot I've
been more or less lean bulking using a
semi-tracking semi-intuitive approach my
weight as of this morning I think was
158 pounds so I'm up
about four pounds from my lowest
weigh-in for the photo shoot and I feel
like as of right now I'm at a point
where I've just kind of filled out a lot
so I I feel I look a little bit thicker
and Fuller but I haven't really noticed
any at least significant fact gain yet
feeling good the training sessions are
going really well I feel like I am
actually building some muscle and now
from here the plan is basically going to
be for me to add roughly a half a pound
to a pound per month for the next six
months so I'm looking for my end weight
to be somewhere around
162 to 165 depending on how things go
visually
um so that's the update from me and how
everything is going and I'll check in
with you guys in the gym with Danny
come here get my warm-up in on the
StairMaster as per usual I usually do
five to ten minutes of this find if I'm
like working at my desk or whatever it
takes a while for me to actually get my
heart rate up get things going this is a
really important part of my warm-up also
I'm here with my boy Danny what's up
guys we're going to be getting in are we
doing upper body today
biceps yeah sweet okay I actually
haven't done that's okay no that's fine
I haven't done a full back workout since
my injury but things have been going
really well so I'm good to do it I just

curry sounds really good to me
