trained to what they call failure half
the time they're not even actually doing
that kind of just moving and like
screaming but like how hardcore is it
for you just be in every rep and
actually like feeling the rep
every and you're in your mind the whole
time like I want to quit but
you're not it's like a marathon runner
just like I have eight Hills left in
this marathon and I know each of them
gets steady and steadier of an incline
but I'm going to do it so like
toward the end of your session you're
like like right now I'm just like well I
still got to control this rep
and I still got to go fore goddamn close
to failure or I could just be like you
know I'm so
hardcore is that
