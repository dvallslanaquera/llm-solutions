I don't know
oh
[Music]
hey folks Dr Mike here from Renaissance
preparation that's Jared feather ifb Pro
this is Dylan White
and he is
are you a Natty Pro
yes a natural Pro oh sorry he was a
natural Pro and he still is huh LOL
double I wink here give him that double
eye wink say no you're not you are
you always are but you can't come back
and do any more shows why
one reason look at them shoes man they
literally don't let you compete looking
fresh like that them shit's got that
white on white
in any case
all happy feelings for now but Dylan is
here to do a hypertrophy high volume leg
workout and when he walked in he was
like Hey like I was like what's on the
agenda he's like my rep match for leg
press and I was like I'm sorry what what
did you just say my rap leg press he
said no my match leg press which means
whatever reps he gets in that first set
he has to with as many rest breaks as he
can without racking the bar get the same
number of reps every single set after
for how many sets now three whatever his
asshole coach program asshole coach is
present asshole in general as president
villain's a nice guy a real fucking salt
to the Earth Midwestern type
motherfucker follow his ass on the
socials if he survives a sparkoff and if
not go down there before Instagram takes
us a countdown because he's dead he's
just say all right P let's get to
training
after you finish your first set I want
you to reach over if you can if not I'll
just come over and help you and go
immediately to the 90s you're gonna do
as many reps as you can with the 90
after five distance seconds rest and
then immediately to the 70 and do the
same thing again that'll be one set
[Music]
actually Center control Dylan
we are not racing for numbers every rep
is its own every rep is high quality
just enjoy the ride so for leg curls
today we're not going to do Straight
sets we're not going to do my rep
matching for lead curls we are going to
do mini drop sets so it's going to be
each set is going to be however much the
guys can do very close to failure with
whatever weight they chose without
moving out of the machine we're going to
change that weight to be about two
notches lower something like 20 or 30
pounds lower depending on the machine
they're going to rest five to ten
seconds hit it again one notch lower hit
it again close to failure each time
that's one set the good news is like you
might not need more than like two or
three sets like that and then they're
going to be cooked but that's something
to try and you're training just a little
bit of variation a little bit of a
metabolite drive it's really tough but
as they say
it's working I don't know I'm not doing
this workout fuck them
two more and we do a drop
slow controlled
one more
slow controlled
drop
relax take your feet out for a sec
okay a couple breaths
[Music]
nine
[Music]
ten two more two more fuck this and
bullshit Dylan you got this shit all
fucking day eleven one last one coming
up control
oh shit Dylan
slow rack stand up for a sec
shake it out a little bit
my man run towards the pain the pain is
where the growth is Dylan we want more
of this nine my man three more
[Music]
all right
amazing
[Music]
last one coming up
convincing and slow on the way down too
slow
gentle
that's it
oh
all right that was excellent that was a
sunset
yay
um I don't know if any of you guys have
had this but I had the ACL surgery a
long time ago where they took a
hamstring draft
uh this exercise sometimes makes me
cramp up a little bit uh why do them
then Jared I really like this eccentric
on a lying leg curl over like a seed leg
curl or a hip inch it's one of the
exercises where I actually get a pump in
my hamstrings it's one of the only ones
I feel that so I'm gonna try to that
much time under tension likely is going
to cause a cramp but I'm going to try
the drop set stuff if I can't get
through all these drop sets I'll do
milder matching on my next set but I
want to do this we'll see it's feeling a
little crampy today but I'm gonna try my
best of my abilities
and matching that level of intensity
holy shit Dylan's a fucking animal hell
yes there it is
how the fuck do you do something in
their second Dylan's a freak bro
it's so much for that shit you have to
drop more let's go baby you're good we
don't need that many reps man slow
the rest just a little longer this time
and finish up oh look at that bottom oh
my God beautiful look at that eccentric
fast mind muscle in the industry
this
foreign
[Music]
good shit
lying leg curls is a first exercise
first of all why it's kind of weird like
you show up to do hamstrings or quads
and most people would be like well let's
get the hard heavy shit out of the way
first
and um I'll say getting the heart heavy
shit out of the way first is cool but
the problem is once you get really big
and strong like Dylan if you do my rep
Mash leg press and then squats after
the amount of throughput energy you have
for hamstrings after is so decreased
it's just hard to train the hams you're
just weak or systemically you can't sum
enough neural drive to the hamstrings
anymore because for hours you're gonna
be wrecked now let's think about thought
experiment the other way around
if you do hamstrings first lying leg
curls can you really still some enough
fucking willpower or neural drive to do
a hard quad session yes absolutely as a
matter of fact after light crows you
kind of feel a little bit warmed up the
muscle doesn't really actively interfere
with anything so we're good to go so a
little trick is sometimes you want to do
the easier stuff first as long as it's
not eliminating factor for the next
stuff and then do the hard stuff and
then just leave because the kind of the
fundamental idea here is that once you
do the hard shit you don't do shit after
certainly nothing that would constitute
a robust stimulus
resist
[Music]
well Jill
[Music]
all the way down
two more
all the way down
last one
yes slow resist don't let me pull it
down
and then slow all the way to the touch
oh that's it
oh
dude yeah awesome
awesome
so Dylan here
might look familiar to a lot of you long
time subscribers of the RP Channel
because you also got to follow him
indirectly through us bringing him onto
the channel and me being his coach for
the last few years
Dylan was a natural Pro once a natural
Pro show super high level and
competitive
and over the course of eight to ten
years of natural bodybuilding he decided
hey I want to make the leap to the the
next stage so we're actually preparing
Dylan for an NPC National show to
potentially get an iPhone Pro card since
you last Saw Dylan he's put on about 20
pounds of muscle
uh so you know you don't exactly do that
at the end of a natural bodybuilding
career take that for what you will
see natural in every other video we ever
did 100 fucking percent
100 natural never did anything I
absolutely crazy I think on stage you
were and then 180 198. yeah
so now we're gonna put this motherfucker
on stage at like 220.
receiving an iPhone card
[Music]
Mr Dillon is going to be doing four
plates on the Arsenal leg press as far
as I can tell probably the best if I
press on the market or very close
and uh it's gonna be a super huge full
range of motion a gentle pause at the
bottom he's going to try to do something
like 15 to 20 reps
and he's warmed up
he's ready to go he actually warmed up
by doing 455 for a set of four this is a
great strategy you want to use if you
want like your first set peace week or
something to be a real big set you want
to feel great on your first set
the last one could be a hundred and ten
percent or something like that of your
first work set yeah mind muscle
connection the technique the sfr goes
through the roof with that smaller
weight is now just easier to handle he's
going to try to do something like 20
reps very close to failure
straight set we'll see if that works out
maybe it's going to be 15.
and then after that all of the remaining
two sets he has left are gonna try to
match that number no matter how many
little mile rep five to ten seconds
breaks with his knees locked out he has
to take uh stay tuned aim is inbound two
more
grow time Dylan grow time one more down
big chassis it's like a deep
[Music]
22 is a hell of a number to start with
my man are you gonna match these
no no you're gonna match these I'm just
gonna stand here and bitch saying that
makes a huge difference like taking that
half second pause at the top getting a
full contraction yes
the other differences speeds into the
pump yes the other difference it makes
is it gives you a half second to rest
and people think like oh that's pussy
shit like no no that means you do more
reps in the same set it makes it worse
give that a shot folks good news bad
news
good news is we still get to watch Dylan
fucking die it's gonna be great
Bad news I've been for those you don't
know I started a prep
and then it started pretty like pretty
Rocky uh some weird water
compartmentalization issues dry joints
led to a back injury while I was
sleeping which then led to making it
worse in the gym
uh fortunately my legs are a strong
point of mine and I'm on my last
accumulation week of my mesocycle so
just for you all this will help some of
the more nerdy followers who give a shit
about this stuff I'm going to move this
into a light session or a maintenance
volume session for me
um probably just a couple sets of 20 for
the quad switch again quads are a strong
point of mind there's gonna be plenty of
volume for me uh probably five plates
couple sets of 20.
um
and then we'll just keep killing Dylan
basically but for for those of you that
run into these types of issues whether
it be injury or the local musculature
isn't recovering on time these types of
light sessions are good to throw in and
they'll actually promote a little more
recovery so you'll notice I'm gonna be
wearing my belt and all kinds of funky
shit because I'm just trying to protect
my lower back as much as possible I can
completely call it right now but I don't
think the injury is bad enough where I
really need to I want to still get some
quad volume in so for me a couple sets
of 20 blade press Dylan he's gonna die
the rest of the time let's do it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
big push fuck yeah let's go two more
one more come on Dylan

[Applause]
not going to be a ton of these rough
Phillips to do everything right
Smith machine squats
what we're going to have Dylan do
he's only going to use a plate on each
side kind of a lot now because the
squads are dead but he's going to
descend with a three or four second
eccentric
and then at the bottom of the position
the bottom of the squat he is going to
hold for three whole seconds on each rep
shitload of tension directly under an
immense stretch
ouch might not be that many reps here
but each rep is going to be so
stimulative it's going to make a huge
difference to his muscle gains last
thing we're doing here probably two sets
of this maybe one more if he's into it
up
one more Dylan
one more Dylan
you got this Dylan
big chest the last rep is going to be
done right
woman

all you long femur having motherfuckers
who say you can't spot deep or leg press
deep
Dylan's legs are like 65 of his fucking
body
look how long these things are if you
use a wedge
Point your toes out correctly open your
hips properly you can get into deep
positions in the squat it might take a
little wider stance it might take a
little bit more of a choke point out but
you can go deep you're making fucking
excuses because you don't like the pain
