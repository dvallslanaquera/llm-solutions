hey folks
dr mike here with renaissance
superiorization rp plus
hypertrophy concepts and tools video
number
14 sra intricacies
the intricacies and very very
interesting implications
of taking an advanced look at the
stimulus recovery and adaptation
principle so we're going to talk about
the sra curve just generally
then we're going to split up the curves
there's actually two curves in the sra
curve technically there's a growth curve
and recovery curve
and um we're going to talk about how to
align growth and recovery and how that
actually happens in real life versus
what is ideal
we're going to zoom in and define
recovery not so much defining it but
it's sort of defining it in context
after to make sure that we're all on the
same page
uh it's interesting that it comes after
some of the discussion it's not a huge
deal just to make sure that we're not
thinking uh recovery something is that
it isn't
we're going to talk about the downside
of training when not recovered on the
other hand which is to say too
frequently
and on the other hand we're going to
talk about training sort of not
frequently enough uh
and the problem of dead times that arise
and then we're gonna bring it all
together and potentially hint at a
solution
and that solution will be explored more
in later videos the solution being to
you know sort of how do you select the
optimal frequency let's get
right into it the sra curve which is
what you see in front of you
and these figures by the way are from
the incoming and depending on when you
watch this already released
uh hypertrophy book uh scientific
principles of our perjury training the
very very similar graph will appear
there and be explained in detail
so if you're a better reader than you
are listener then go to that resource
for sure
let's take a look at this curve and see
exactly what it means this is
a way to represent the sra curve at
point a in that curve all the way to the
left is
when the training stimulus is actually
presented so you have a hard training
session
and we're looking at the y-axis where
the x-axis is time
the y-axis is actually fitness
okay so fitness means essentially your
ability to perform
right after you train hard you will
notice that your fitness declines right
if someone
you did a really hard leg workout and
someone said two hours later i want you
to repeat that exact leg workout and
that would keep you on the dotted line
by the way in this graph
there's no way you could do that you
would be so tired and so messed up
you would underperform and if we asked
you at various random points over the
next several days to re-perform that leg
workout you wouldn't be able to do so
until you hit just a little bit below
point
c when that line the recovery curve
starts to exceed pass our normal
abilities
and around point c that recovery curve
should if it's an adaptation that's
occurring and net adaptation
actually get a little bit above the
previous
uh presentation of a stimulus which is
to say you should be able to
uh at least have the underlying
characteristics because that's just
fitness we're not sure about fatigue yet
and where that plays in
at least your underlying fitness is now
higher
which is to say in hypertrophy you've
probably built some muscle
and now that you're at a higher level
when you repeat this sra curve
hypothetically by re-stimulating again
you know sometime around point c
you're now starting from a higher point
and then if you do that ellipse again
you start from a higher higher and
higher point and that's how progression
occurs
plain and simple now this is an advanced
lecture of intricacy so let's make it a
little bit more complicated
and take a look at the growth curve and
that giant red arrow is obnoxiously
pointing at the
growth curve there so two things
actually happen in the sra
concept or principle that are a little
bit different from one another
and it pays to look at them in a
slightly isolated sense
the growth curve right there is probably
how muscle grows
after the presentation of a stimulus for
at least an intermediate individual
in an uh a sort of average hypertrophy
program you could think of this as like
twice a week training so the training
can occur at point a in the graph
and then uh first training like a monday
and then point c in the graph would be a
representation of training again that
would be like a thursday just as a
simple example there's
tons of different ways to do it what you
notice is that the growth curve
generally tends to go up for a while and
studies have shown that a day or longer
can expire until growth hits its maximum
right so after a typical training
session muscle growth actually elevates
for some time
stays at its peak for a little while and
then slowly drops off again
okay so that's how growth works and
you'll notice that there's a little tail
end
there where not a whole lot of net
growth is happening possibly none but we
still haven't trained again
why in god's name when we wait that long
well for that we're gonna go right into
the next slide which is the recovery
curve
big red arrow right below the growth
curve same exact graph
just looking at that bottom part that
answers our question as to why we didn't
just train
somewhere just two-thirds of the way
from a to c
is because we were not sufficiently
recovered okay
the recovery curve tells us okay after
point a
our performance starts to decline
our ability to perform again at that
level starts to decline and you'll
notice something interesting
sometimes the so the shape here is
simplified
there are many different shapes of this
curve that can occur but what this is
designed to illustrate
is that your performance actually
declines for performance ability your
fitness actually declines
more and more the longer you wait after
training for some time
in cases in which you are just acutely
fatigued and will not be experiencing
delayed onset muscle soreness
you know uh if you are still in the gym
and you've had a sort of good ability to
train you're still warmed up you can
actually perform at a pretty good level
in the hour two or three after some of
the
fatigue really starts to set in and your
performance actually goes down
significantly further right in that case
in even easier training sometimes your
performance at the end of the session
is as low as it'll get and then the
entire curve just climbs thereafter
until it gets back to baseline right
so then that curve would look a little
different however
especially with really hard training
especially with the late onset muscle
soreness
you can actually get a dip in
performance that's at its lowest point a
day two or three
after the training occurs right like if
you are performing not so great level
but you haven't gotten sore yet you
could still perform at a pretty decent
level you're just very very tired
but once you get crazy delayed outside
soreness sometimes your performance is
worse with that onset soreness a day or
two or sometimes in rare instances even
three days later
so but regardless how of this curve
looks exactly
it comes back up to return to normal
performance which is to say recovery
at around point c so the next question
of
why don't we just train two-thirds
between a and c again when muscle growth
has completed
because our training would not be at the
highest performance level
the magnitude of stimulus we could thus
generate would be lower
we would potentially have trouble
presenting a true progressive
overload in the sense that the last
stimulus was a certain amount and the
next stimulus is
at least as much or more so if we train
too soon sure
we'll reinstantiate some muscle growth
again but we haven't made a full
recovery
we're starting at a lower point if we
repeat that process over and over and
over
we're getting incrementally less and
less and less muscle growth with every
session
pretty rapidly falling and because we
never recover completely
our recovery starts to go further and
further and further down
and then we're not doing anything except
just spinning our wheels imagine you're
squatting
and doing hack squats with 405 pounds
for roughly sets of 10
if you hack squat too soon after right
after the muscle growth has stopped
because muscle growth tends to stop
before fatigue has dropped and
intermediate advanced trainees
if you had squat a little too soon you
might be able to get 405
for sets of eight still stimulate some
muscle growth so you're good there but
the fatigue is starting to really
accumulate and remember you start at a
lower point than normal
where you should be able to do four or
five percent of 10 and 11 if you waited
long enough and got a true
adaptation or at least even a fatigue
goes just up as much
as adaptation at least just still sets a
10 again right
so then four or five for eight and then
you again don't rest long enough and you
again hit a workout
and all of a sudden you're doing four or
five versus a six and then you know a
workout later
sets of four and so on and so forth at
what point are you getting
essentially maintenance volumes and
intensities gee whiz you know if you're
growing well from five sets of 10
uh with 405 then uh you know
five sets of four to six might actually
be just maintaining muscle
but at what cost huge fatigue cost it's
just not worth it to train
until fatigue has subsided enough to
where you can at least perform
at normal levels right so
this growth and recovery alignment is
exactly what we're talking about here
here's the deal in this graph right here
the ideal growth and recovery alignment
would be this
and that's the first uh graph all the
way on the left it says i deal right
next to it
your recovery number is on bottom growth
is on top
so that growth curve extends doubly as
long as the recovery curve
if your growth curve is longer than your
recovery curve that means that
by the time that you are done growing
and you're ready to stimulate another
bout of growth
you are more than completely recovered
which we could posit would mean that you
might have reduced
some or all of even cumulative fatigue
which means that if you have a way of
training that allows this
you will never accumulate fatigue or do
so incredibly slowly
and you will grow and grow and grow this
would be a
miracle but unfortunately in almost any
real situation
it doesn't happen what does happen
is this middle graph that is labeled
realistic
it's the same graph that we basically
just saw
you train you get some growth but the
fatigue
reduction the recovery takes a little
bit longer so maybe
your muscle growth is done after two
days of hypertrophy after a session and
you're recovered after three days that
seems to be relatively typical
in many cases and then you know is it
the greatest thing ever no
but it's decent and as long as you wait
until you recover and
to train you know training sooner is
sustainable and it's really good now
in some situations very very bad
genetics very very bad stress management
insufficient food insufficient sleep
uh and a very advanced age of career
right as you reach your genetic limits
you start to get what i would typify as
a harsh condition all the way to the
right
in which you gain you know
you grow for maybe a day as an example
you're done growing after day one
and it takes you something like three or
four days to recover to train hard again
boy oh boy is that bad deal
is there a way to grow more in this
circumstance
not really not at face value at least
because if someone was to say why don't
you just train the next day
you're training vastly under recovered
which means that training is first of
all greatly underpowered might not cause
any muscle growth or just a tiny amount
and it starts to accumulate an
unbelievable amount of fatigue because
you're not even done dropping the acute
fatigue from this last session now
you're slamming another session on top
of that
very quickly that becomes unsustainable
so we're
harsh is most people aren't going to run
into this too often
though if you're pushing your genetic
limits with all of your modalities or
you're doing a bad job of sleeping so on
and so forth you will experience this
we want to shoot for realistic and of
course as ideal as possible
but we can't expect ideal because it is
in fact very rare
right just to clarify
what we mean when we say recovered in
this context there's a different context
for recovery
slightly different definition um
recovered means
that you can present another
progressively overloading stimulus which
means it's going to be as hard as last
time
training or a little bit harder that's
it if you can't at least train as hard
as last time for the same muscle group
so on and so forth
or a little bit harder then you're
training less hard and remember your
body becomes resistant to adaptations
even with the same training
and imagine how resistant to adaptations
it is if your training gets
progressively less difficult
right after a while you're accumulating
a lot of fatigue and getting
almost none or no growth whatsoever
recovered in this context does not mean
completely healed it doesn't mean that
you've dropped a ton of cumulative
fatigue
or all of it that's what deloads are for
that's what active rests are for that
typically doesn't happen
between individual sessions you're not
interested in dropping a ton of fatigue
cumulatively between sessions it's okay
to accumulate fatigue so long as every
single session is progressively
overloading
now eventually cumulative fatigue
catches up and it prevents your next
session from becoming progressively
overloading that is
actually defined as hitting your mrv
your maximum recovery volume
when that happens yep you deload or your
active rest or some combination of the
two
and then you restart the process again
so when we're talking about recovery in
this context
we don't mean like you're completely
recovered all of your cumulative fatigue
is done we just mean you're recovered
enough
to present an overloading stimulus again
a stimulus that's progressively
overloading which means it's just at
least a little better than last time
at the very worst it's the same as last
time but never less than last time
what happens if we try to train when not
recovered
okay we got a really complex graph here
uh
and but it's actually quite simple if
you just zoom in really quick
so it's uh point b here let's look at
point a
first we got muscle growth and recovery
these are just a bunch of sra curves
uh split out and stack one next to each
other
so the muscle and the so curve our
series of curves a here
muscle growth and recovery we see that
muscle growth
occurs at a certain time scale and
recovery at exactly the same time scale
oh that's pretty sweet uh that would be
nearly ideal
right ideal would be if it was even
growth was even longer than recovery but
this is real good right
so you there's no dead time every time
you're recovered
you also have just done finished growing
your muscle and you re-stimulate again
awesome
but what if we rush the process what if
we train more often
and you see this little graph that looks
like a fish bone like a really poor
artist's rendition of fishbone
graph b okay so slide b over here
we have muscle growth and recovery going
up
and then we train again halfway through
this process
maybe when you're under recovered and
you've peaked out muscle growth now in
this graph it's oversimplified
it's showing that cumulative fatigue
hasn't even
interfered with our muscle growth
process right
it's showing us that essentially what
ends up happening is
uh you know we still get the same muscle
growth every single time we stimulate
cool pretty cool charitable
okay so this is even the best version of
this that could possibly happen
and what do we get still well if you
notice
if we just take one of these little fish
bones okay the ones that are pointing
like this if we just flip it like this
and connect the dots the area under the
curve for muscle growth
is exactly the same
except how many training sessions did it
take
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 versus the five training sessions in
example a
so you're training twice as long to get
the identical gains
what is essentially occurring is someone
you could be at peak
growth right and someone says hey listen
if you restimulate right now
you get great growth again okay but hold
on a second if i do nothing
for the next let's say day and a half or
something growth falls off
but growth falling off means there's
still growth occurring at every single
uh you know minute an hour and so on and
so forth until growth goes back to zero
if we already paid the fatigue cost for
getting that growth going
why in god's name would we try to
re-stimulate it when the going is good
with precisely zero fatigue right
that's like a rocket ship going at
exactly the speed you want it to go
and it's not even slowing down yet and
you're like man if we hit the other
booster right now we could go even
faster
there's no it won't there's a cap on the
speed it won't go any faster than that
so what does the booster get us we just
pissed away a whole lot again
you know gallons of gasoline or fuel or
whatever rocket fuel for no good reason
at all but
a ton of fatigue occurs so we
essentially get double the fatigue and
roughly
the same amount of adaptation now
somebody could say now hold on a second
potentially restimulating growth again
when growth is already high could even
higher growth highly unlikely
and if we really hear that argument out
we'll just throw the cumulative fatigue
card back in
well your workouts are going to be dog
shit because you're going to be weaker
this whole time and they're like ah
that's a good point
the best possible result is that we get
double the fatigue
and the exact same amount of growth the
realistic result
is we probably get double the fatigue
but diminishing rates of growth until
halfway through this process
session number five or something we're
not growing at all terrible idea
which is why there absolutely is such a
thing as training too frequently
given a certain session volume so if
you're doing
six sets per session per muscle group
and you just double the number of
sessions you were doing from before you
absolutely could be 100
doing too much and getting almost
nothing out of it right
so training without recovered not a
great idea
another problem that can arise let's say
you're super scared of training when not
recovered somebody really got to you
you stopped watching you know after this
last statement you went to go
design your training program you might
design a training program if you're
really scared about recovery
it looks like option c right so
in in option c here uh there's a big red
arrow and says what are you waiting for
right we essentially train at some point
we both recover
and we get all of the uh growth that
we're gonna get
and then we wait for who knows what
rick your body's recovered you're ready
to do another stimulative overloading
session sweet
you're no longer growing muscle so
there's nothing to wait for on that end
either
so what are we waiting for well not much
right now you could say
well the cumulative fatigue could fall
but you're missing out for sure
and then you accumulate fatigue slower
which is cool but you're missing a lot
of time
right and the way accumulative fatigue
works is
it's really easy to drop human fatigue
by taking only a short time to drop the
vast majority of it like a week
every four to four to eight weeks drops
almost all the cumulative fatigue you
could have had
right most of it so if you're taking
your training frequency and it's
essentially
dividing it by two you want you are
recovered and ready
to train let's say four times a week per
muscle group but you're only training
twice a week
same exact volumes each time because
you're like really paranoid about
recovery
you'll be getting much less muscle
growth through the four to eight weeks
and let's say
that you could go eight weeks like that
without needing a deload
and somebody who's doing the four-time
session needs four weeks
okay and that's all they can go well
after one little week
right of deloading after week five
they're already getting gains again
because they're already
training hard they dropped all their
fatigue meanwhile you're still getting
relatively not so impressive adaptations
but you're getting them slow and steady
for eight whole weeks and then you still
have to take a de-load week at the end
of that
the paradigm that you're working with is
eight to one
not bad they're working with uh four to
one paradigm which isn't as good
but they get much more growth per week
and their per week growth makes up for
that right
it's kind of like someone who works
really really hard at a job
not too hard right but really try super
hard
and then after they're finished with
their big project they go on vacation
and just relax and have a great
time that's a four to one paradigm
example right
whereas someone else could like fuck off
a lot at work
not get a ton done in any one week or
too much recovery
um and they do work here and there but
then like they can only take their
vacation once every
eight weeks because every project takes
them double right it turns out
that in most cases that person who works
really hard and implies themselves and
then takes a vacation
probably gets more done with each year
of training or of work than the person
who waits way too long because if you're
waiting
really long why don't we wait double
like we'll have no cumulative fatigue
we'll continue to train all the time but
even if we didn't lose muscle between
sessions which we do a little bit let's
say that's not a concern
we're growing at an unbelievably slow
pace because we
barely ever train right there is
absolutely such a thing as too frequent
training which is option b but option c
is too infrequent of training right
so let's bring it all together and use
this chart again
the sort of slide i've been using a
bunch of terms
uh graph a over here is nearly ideal
like more ideal would be if recovery was
even shorter
but it's not realistic we want to shoot
for this as much as we can
which is to say we want to recover as
quickly as possible doing everything we
can
and so nutrition uh your training
structure
your sleep your stress so on and so
forth and we also want to grow as much
muscle with all of those things and and
others
so that our muscle growth takes the
longest and reaches the highest
magnitude
and our recovery takes the shortest and
doesn't reach uh
super far down right totally we're going
to try to get as close as
we can but we don't want to base our
training programs on expecting this
because it's just not really likely to
occur right
so on the other hand
too frequent is option b over here
that's if we're training when muscle
growth hasn't been completed for the
cycle yet
nor has recovery been achieved just a
stupid idea
and then if we get paranoid about
recovery we can get into this problem of
too infrequent of training
where we wait until recovery and muscle
growth are both done and then we keep
waiting
maybe long enough for cumulative fatigue
to fall almost completely
and we just end up just being able to
squish much less muscle growth into any
unit time
the thing is fatigue does accumulative
cue does accumulate
but it actually is really
straightforward to drop
so we don't have to worry about not
accumulating fatigue
it's okay to accumulate fatigue you'll
just pay that cost when it's time to pay
the cost right
another analogy that we've used in the
the recovery book
is uh you know if you are cooking like a
like a dirty animal
and just throwing spaghetti everywhere
you're not gonna be able to cook much
food and your kitchen is going to suck
that's kind of like option b but option
c is like
trying to cook without making remotely
any mess at all and washing
each dish and each spoon as you cook
you're going to be
wildly inefficient your food's gonna be
fine you're gonna produce so little of
it
because you can't tarnish the kitchen
okay realistic and effective
is option d in the cooking analogy would
be you do a great job cooking you cook
as frequently and you cook well
you're not purposely trying to make a
mess but at the same time if there's
some pasta sauce here and there you're
not terribly worried about it
because every now and again that's when
the d-load happens you clean up the
whole kitchen everything's spotless and
then you begin that cycle again
in this case for muscle growth you grow
a little bit
less than you recover but once you've
recovered you train hard again and
repeat and repeat and repeat and that
gets you really really really good
results
right now
all of what we just said is true
but all of what we just said assumes the
same volume per session
every single one of those examples could
be like six sets per session
per muscle group like chest for six sets
right
what we can do is if six sets is the
volume
using all of those theoretical
constructs we can find the optimal
frequency pretty easily
because we just see how long it takes us
to recover from six sets and train
exactly as soon as we recover we train
again and recover training and so on and
so forth right
so if six sets of chest is the only way
you train chest which may or may not be
the case
or about six sets of chest let's see
your body gets used to over time so
anywhere between four and
seven sets of chest or four and eight
sets or something then you could say
like for that volume
maybe three time a week chest training
is really close to perfect right
but does that mean frequencies that are
much higher much lower or worse
it doesn't because we also can
potentially move around
the length of the curves by altering how
many sets we're doing
if you're doing between you know six and
ten sets of chest each time
the recovery is going to take longer you
won't be able to do three sets of or
three sessions of chest
every week maybe two is your new optimal
given that per session volume
what if you do like three sets of chest
per workout well then you might be able
to squeeze in some more workouts right
so a huge factor in determining optimal
frequency
probably the biggest is per session
volume
but once your per session volume is
something you know relatively well
the frequency is pretty easy to find the
way to find that is
as soon as you're done recovering and
you can perform at a high level again
it's probably time to train again folks
catch you next time
for the next
you
