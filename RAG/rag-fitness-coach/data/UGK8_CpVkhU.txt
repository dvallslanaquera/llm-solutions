hey rp plus rpu
welcome back dr james hoffman here and
today we're going to be on
part two of our movement anatomy series
we're going to be talking today about
the shoulder and all its fun movements
that it can do
however before we start this video make
sure you go and
watch the first video on movement
anatomy to make sure you are clear with
all the terms and directional movements
and things like
that otherwise this one might be a
little bit confusing
so just be sure you're up to date on all
the movement terminology that we're
going to be using
and then hopefully you can enjoy this
video even more so let's get started
so today we're going to be talking
primarily about the shoulder there's a
lot of stuff going on with this
and we're going to try and keep it to
the point and not too rambly
but we're going to be talking about
basically how the humerus interacts with
the clavicle
the scapula and how we can do movement
of the arms in the upper extremities so
it should be pretty interesting
and at the end i'll give you some
examples of things that we're talking
about in exercise and sporting context
so let's get started so when we're
talking about movement of the shoulder
we're generally breaking down two major
kind of sub groups or sub regions within
the shoulder
because there's a lot of different
moving parts so there's two big ones
the shoulder girdle or sometimes called
the shoulder complex
and then the actual shoulder joint
itself is treated separately
for the most part now we can talk about
them collectively and independently
and it's kind of hard to talk about them
independently because they work together
right
but we're going to break it down a
little bit and then we'll talk about how
those things move in conjunction with
each other
so the first one the shoulder girdle or
the shoulder complex
generally refers to all the muscles and
tissues interacting or acting on this
clavicle and the scapula right so the
clavicle being
that collar bone right here which i
think is actually one of the
statistically most
uh broken bones out there unless that's
unless i'm wrong i think it is
and then the scapula which is that big
big shoulder blade bone on
the posterior side of your body and so
we can see on the slide we've got a nice
image here
we can see the clavicle the sternum the
scapula and we can even see the humerus
here
so for today we're going to be trying to
figure out kind of how all these things
interact and how we can accurately
describe them in terms of movement terms
so let's go on to the next one so here
we can see a huge
list of muscles and some information on
all these muscles
and how they act on the shoulder girdle
so we can see a pretty good list here we
got the rhomboids
levator scapulae pec minor serratus
anterior and trapezius now
what we have on the slide is the origin
and insertion for all these muscle
groups
now this is something and like i have a
phd in spore physiology
homies i can't remember this stuff this
is something that you're going to need
to have a table which i have made for
you
and reference later right if you want to
try and memorize all this stuff
that's awesome and my hat's off to you
if you can do that
i personally cannot however we still
need to know these things from time to
time it's just not worth your time
trying to memorize all of these things
at least all the time so we can see for
each one we have the origin
and insertion which we talked about in
the last video and if we know
the origin and the insertion for each
muscle group we can start to do like a
little vector analysis and start to
figure out okay well if i know it starts
here and ends here and if the muscle can
only shorten
i have a pretty good idea of what types
of movements
that muscle is capable of but
unfortunately
in order to benefit from that
information we have to be able to
identify all these anatomical structures
and landmarks which can be challenging
so if you haven't taken an anatomy and
physiology course before
some of this might be a little
overwhelming and that's okay don't worry
about it too much
we've also given you the short readers
digest version on the side where it says
action
so you'll see for each muscle we have
the origin insertion and then we have a
description of what actions it can do
so we can see things for like the
rhomboids is responsible for doing
things like scapular retraction which
would be pulling the shoulder blades
back
downward rotation of the scapula which
is pulling them back down into
anatomical position when they've been
raised up
and we can actually see uh elevation in
some cases where they actually pull
up high so each one of these muscles has
a description on here so we're just
going to go kind of
i don't want to say briefly but really
we're just going to hit on the muscle
actions and not spend a lot of time
on the actual origins and insertions
this is here for your reference so you
can look this up later
and have a better understanding of a p
so we already touched on the rhomboids
another one that we want to be concerned
with with the shoulder girdle is the
levator scapulae
and this is going to be responsible for
scapular elevation as well as
downward rotation now some of these
might sound a little foreign
if you haven't been around this kind of
lingo before don't worry we're going to
describe all these a couple more times
throughout this lecture so if you're
already feeling lost
just hang in there we'll go through it
again no worries
pec minor really really hard to see
because it's really deep in there and
it's covered up by that pec major right
this is another one that's going to be
acting on the shoulder girdle it's going
to be responsible for scapular
protraction which is kind of a weird one
that we don't think about too much this
is where we're actually kind of winging
our scapula out and forward like this
and then we're also going to be doing
depression and downward rotation of that
scapula
another one that's really cool is the
serratus anterior it's this weird one up
here that gives your
abs that like nice cool jagged uh saw
blade kind of shape up by the ribs
really really neat looking this one's
going to be involved in scapular
protraction
and then upward rotation so bringing
them up and kind of flaring out
and then last but not least we have the
trapezius which is a gigantic muscle and
if you actually look
at the origin insertions you can see the
scope of the actual muscle itself i mean
it's
humongous so generally it's broken down
into three regions because it's so large
typically the upper traps are
differentiated from kind of the middle
traps
and the lower traps as you can imagine
starting inferior
excuse me starting superiorly and
working inferiorly so it's generally
broken down into three regions
they have some kind of synergy
synergistic roles together
so the major uh things that we'll see
are elevation of the scapula and
clavicle
that'd be for the upper fibers elevation
upward rotation
and retraction of the scapula for kind
of the more middle fibers
and then for the lower ones depression
upward rotation
and retraction of the scapula so we see
some synergy there but slight
differences as well
again this is here for your information
i would not waste a lot of time
going through the origins and insertions
to the point where you can announce them
verbatim that's cool if you can and
that's awesome
i can't do it and i have a phd in this
stuff so that should tell you something
right
so here it is for there for your
information to reference at a different
time
now some of these muscle actions are
things that you should be at least
rudimentarily familiar with so if i was
to say
true or false the rhomboids are involved
in scapular retraction
you should pretty readily know the
answer to that some of the other ones
like which ones do
downward rotation upward rotation still
in your benefit of knowing but maybe
lesser importance but definitely the
gross movements like elevation
depression
protraction retraction you should be
able to answer those pretty readily so
this might be a good thing to look at
if you haven't looked at that before
let's go on to the next one
so here we can see what these muscles
actually look like so no big surprise
that big one leading up to the neck
over by the clavicle that's the
trapezius from the anterior view
we can also see the serrated anterior
under the armpit kind of kind of
up in the upper rib cage here it gives
it that nice kind of jagged saw blade
mountain range kind of look
on the right we can see that pec major
which is really really hard to see in a
lot of anatomical diagrams
if you actually look at the diagram they
actually cut the pec major
by the humerus and then over by the
sternum so that you can actually see the
pec minor
and the way it interacts on the scapula
which is pretty cool
and then last but not least we have a
posterior view where we can see the
trapezius from another angle and we can
see how big it is right it goes all the
way up to the back your head
and goes all the way towards your lumbar
spine i mean it's huge it's gigantic
we can also see the levator scapulae
which are going to be involved in that
scapular elevation
and then of course we can see the
rhomboids which are going to be very
important for
scapular retraction so just in case you
haven't seen these before here's just a
quick
version of what some of these look like
hopefully you've seen them before
all right let's go on to the next one so
here is a diagram of the bones of the
shoulder
girdle and shoulder complex here and
we're not super super concerned with all
the landmarks in this diagram
there's just a few that are worth noting
and we've kind of highlighted here for
you
so first off the shoulder griddle has a
number of joints that we should be aware
of
the first one that i want to point out
is the sternoclavicular joint
which is where the clavicle meets the
sternum right sternoclavicular
and you can see that on the far right
hand side of this image so we see the
manubrium of the sternum
interacting with the uh clavicle on the
kind of the opposite side
we have the acromioclavicular joint
which is where the acromion
actually interacts with the clavicle so
acromioclavicular acromion
clavicle and then last but not least
down here which we're going to talk
about
a little bit later is the glenohumeral
joint which is where the humerus or the
arm bone
actually interacts with the glenoid
fossa of the scapula and this is going
to be our nice ball and socket joint
where
our arm will be able to rotate around
and do all sorts of cool movements
the other joints in here aren't quite as
mobile obviously as you probably have
guessed the sternoclavicular joint the
ac
joint don't move around too much and
when they do separate it becomes kind of
a problem
we can also see some other landmarks
here which we're not going to spend a
ton of time
talking about the bicipital groove the
lesser tubercle
greater tubercle on the humerus this is
where a lot of action
in terms of insertions occur for a lot
of the muscles acting on the humerus
there it is i knew it was coming and so
this is kind of what we're looking at at
least from the bones perspective now
once we know
how all the muscles kind of interact on
these bony structures
we have a pretty good idea of what types
of actions they'll be able to do
so that's something that i encourage you
to play around with in your free time if
you're really really interested in these
topics
find the origin insertion of those
different muscles and see if you can do
like a little mini vector analysis and
see what the line of pull on those
muscles would be
and that would make a lot more sense as
we discussed this all right let's go on
to the next
so here are just a friendly reminder of
some of these movement terms right so if
we're talking about something that does
scapular elevation
that would be where the scapulas are
raising superiorly right towards the
head so i'd be doing kind of the
shrugging motion
so an example of an exercise might be
like a dumbbell shrug that's scapular
elevation
when they come back down to anatomical
position
that's what we generally call scapular
depression and usually at least i
physically can't i don't know anyone who
can
but usually depression doesn't tend to
go to below
anatomical position unless they are
forcibly moved below that so typically
when we're talking about scapular
depression we're talking about kind of a
return to anatomical position
unless by force moving below that but
typically it doesn't happen too much
on the right hand side we see
protraction and retraction this is one
that's going to be very important for us
as we talk later on
where we're going to actually see the
scapulas being protracted meaning kind
of coming
forward and kind of winging my back out
and then if we're talking about
retraction
we're pulling my scapulas back together
right a good example of an exercise
where we'll be doing some scapular
attraction
might be any of our rolling variations
like a bent over row where we start
protracted
and move into a retracted position right
and then last on here is the rotational
ones the upward and downward rotation
the rotation ones are simply where we
have the scapula
and it's moving up and turning out
that's upward rotation
downward rotation is kind of the same
thing as before a return to anatomical
position
so sometimes people get a little bit
confused on this one you can think of
upward rotation simply as as the scapula
is kind of elevating
and then the bottom pointy end of the
scapula is turning kind of laterally so
it's kind of moving up
and out like this really easy and then
downward rotation is typically when it's
returning to anatomical position
or in some cases if you can really
torque your shoulder you'll actually be
pointing that pointy end of the scapula
back towards the medial side of the body
and then here's just another graphical
representation of what some of that
stuff looks like
same thing just a different diagram
hopefully it makes some sense so we kind
of
like to review some of these terms i
know we talked a little bit about it in
the first lecture
we want to hit it again in the second
lecture just to be clear so whenever we
say
hey protraction retraction abduction
adduction we always know what we're
talking about
okay so what we find is that typically
the movements of the clavicle and
scapula generally are complementary to
movements of the humerus and so we
usually say that the shoulder girdle
and the shoulder joint are coordinated
and um
there are some kind of exercise examples
where we might see like isolated
movement of the clavicle and scapula
without
corresponding movement of the humerus
but those are few and far between
there's only a few
examples that i can think of off top of
my head where we actually are moving the
scapula without really moving the arm
around too much right
typically in sport and exercise all of
those movements usually involve movement
of the humerus
and then a corresponding movement of the
clavicle and scapula
as well so here's just some examples
right if you were to throw a ball
it's very difficult to say like i'm
actually moving the humerus by itself or
i'm moving the scapula by itself they're
coordinated right
same thing with like trying to make a
tackle and somebody in football or rugby
trying to
do a counter movement jump or any number
of other examples so what we want to
keep in mind is that yes the scapula and
clavicle do kind of have their own
independent movement characteristics
but typically they are complementary
meaning like synergistic two
movements of the humerus which we're
going to talk about in a little bit here
all right let's move on so here are some
examples
of some movements that we've already
talked about we have like abduction
adduction flexion extension all these
things
and so typically what we're talking
about in those movements is movement of
the shoulder joint that glenohumeral
joint right
but what we also see is even though i
might be abducting my armor we might
just think okay well it's just there at
the humerus right
we actually also see a corresponding
movement at the shoulder girdle as well
so in this case if we look at abduction
where i'm moving away from the midline
of the body
right not only is my humerus moving out
but i'm also seeing elevation and upward
rotation
of the scapula so they are coordinated
and synergistic so it would be incorrect
to
assume that those things are happening
independently throughout that movement
and so we see more examples of that as
we go through right so for adduction
kind of the polar opposite as i move to
the midline of the body i'm going to see
depression of the scapula and downward
rotation back to the anatomical position
if i'm flexing the shoulder which would
be my arm coming out like this
we'll see elevation and upward rotation
of the scapula
vice versa if i'm extending meaning
moving back or even hyper extending like
going back behind the midline of my body
we'll see depression and downward
rotation of the scapula
and then for things like horizontal
abduction and adduction it's a little
bit different this is something that i
think people get confused
and we'll talk about a little bit but
for horizontal abduction which would be
moving away from the midline of my body
we'll actually see scapular retraction
so if i'm moving my arm away from the
midline of my body in a horizontal
direction
i actually have to retract my scapula to
do that and in order to bring it back to
the midline
i have to protract my scapula to get it
back in place
makes sense so take a look at this one
it's going to come back later to give
you a friendly reminder
let's go on to the next one so when
we're talking about the shoulder joint
now we're generally referring to that
glenohumeral joint which is where
the humerus joins the glenoid fossa and
that nice
ball and socket type joint right this
joint can do
all sorts of fun different movements and
it can do a pretty unique one that we'll
learn about in a second called
circumduction
so when we're talking about the shoulder
joint we're generally referring to
all the muscles and structures resulting
in movement of the humerus which is that
main media arm bone up here right
so generally anything that's going to
act directly on the humerus which there
are many
so we know that there are a number of
different
muscles and structures involved in
moving the humerus
what we have to keep in mind is that not
all of them are necessarily
generating large gross movements or not
necessarily prime movers meaning
the muscles that are primarily involved
in generating the movement we have some
really big muscles that do them
and we also have some smaller muscles
which can do small movements
but sometimes just play a role in
stabilizing that shoulder joint itself
and we're going to learn a little bit
more about that as we go so we kind of
have a good mix of
small muscles which can do finite
movements and stabilize
and we have big muscles which can also
stabilize but also generate
really really gross movements like
horizontal abduction adduction stuff
like that
but there's another one all right let's
go on to the next one
so one of these groups is very common
for most people is the rotator cuff
right the rotator cuff group is a
collective group of about four muscles
and these are relatively small muscles
that act on the scapula
or actually excuse me start usually
start on the scapula and act on the
humerus
and they're generally involved in
stabilizing
the shoulder joint against unwanted
movement so we have four muscles and we
can see the same kind of chart here we
have origins insertions and actions for
all of them
so we can see supraspinatus generally
involved in abducting the arm the
infraspinatus
external rotation subscapularis internal
rotation
and then teres minor external rotation
so again
we're going to show a graphic of these
in a second but if you look at the
origins and insertions
and you're ever confused you can do that
little vector analysis and say okay well
if i start here
i finish here and the muscle can only
move in this direction i can figure out
what that movement is going to be
so let's go on to the next one here here
we can see what this looks like where
they kind of line up on the scapula
and we can see a lot of these kind of
are pretty big they take up a really big
chunk
of the anterior or posterior side of the
scapula
so we can see the infraspinatus right is
infra
below the actual spine of the scapula
whereas the supra is above
supraspinatus is above that spine and we
can see a couple other ones like the
teres minor right
so again if you haven't seen this before
it's just meant to introduce you to this
idea
now keep in mind although they look
really large compared to things like the
latissimus dorsi
the trapezius the pec major these are
relatively small muscles and they're not
going to be generating really really
gross
huge forceful movements these are
primarily going to be involved in
stabilizing the shoulder joint
through dynamic movement so very very
important role
just less in terms of generating
powerful large gross
forceful movements okay so here now we
can see in this next chart
movers of the humerus so we can see
there's a number of different ones up
here
so movers of the humerus really really
big muscle groups involved here so what
we can see is again
origins and insertions for all these and
again we don't want to go through
because i know you don't want to hear me
just read off this table that's
obviously really boring
it's there for your information so it's
there for you to reference later on if
it ever comes up
and we can see the actions for all these
different things so
if we're looking at the first one the
latissimus dorsi the lats right that big
huge fanning muscle of the back that
gives you that nice cool v-tapered look
right
what are the primary roles there where
we can see it's involved in extending
the shoulder
abducting the shoulder retracting the
scapula a little bit internal rotation
of the humerus and horizontal abduction
so
horizontally moving away from the
midline of the body teres major actually
shares the same insertion point i
believe and has a very very similar role
and it's like right in there with the
lats when we see a picture of in a
minute you'll be like oh man that looks
like it's almost the same thing and it's
close but not quite
and that's involved in extension of the
shoulder abduction of the humerus
retraction of the scapula and internal
rotation of the humerus as well
next we have kind of a collective group
the deltoids so most of us are familiar
with the deltoids especially if you're
involved in gem culture
obviously right so when we're talking
about the deltoids it's a really kind of
big fanning
broad area of the shoulder and generally
we break it down into three groups kind
of like we did with the trapezius
so first we have the anterior portion of
the deltoid sometimes we'll call the
front delts
or the anterior delt right and that's
this front portion here on the anterior
side of my body
now keep in mind not nearly as big as
the latissimus dorsi right
our delts we're talking about like
muscle groups the size of like
fingertips they're not really quite that
big
but they do span pretty large area maybe
not compared to the pec
and the lats but relatively speaking
compared to like the rotator cuff
muscles pretty big
so the anterior delt is going to be
involved in abduction
reflection and internal rotation of the
humerus
the medial delts are that lateral
portion out here kind of right in the
middle medial
right in the middle that's going to be
one of our big prime movers for shoulder
abduction meaning out to the side here
right
and then the posterior delt is that back
portion that posterior portion of the
deltoid
and that's going to be involved in
abducting the shoulder as well it's
going to be more involved in extending
the shoulder
and externally rotating that humerus so
we can see this big kind of group of
musculature
they all have a commonality in that they
contribute to abduction
but we can see some slight differences
on the anterior and posterior side of
the deltoids in terms of which muscle
actions they do
resulting in their differences in origin
and insertion points right
so pretty cool stuff and then last but
not least on our list
pec major only trained on mondays
remember that that's mandatory
we know that the pec major is that big
huge huge chest muscle that all of us
are trying to practice
flexing in the mirror the rock's really
good at that i wish i could do it like
the rock does there's a lot of things i
wish i could do like the rock does now
that i think about it
speaking publicly one of them making
videos anyways
getting back to it what does the pec do
well the pecs involved in flexing the
shoulder
adducting horizontally adducting and
internally rotating
that humor so lots and lots of stuff
there so let's go on to the next one
real quick here we can see
where these muscles are on the body
right so in the anterior view we can see
the pec major that big
beefy muscle from the sternum all the
way up to the humerus right into the
armpit that's pectoralis major
above that we can see the deltoids and
we can see it from both the
anterior view and then if we switch to
the posterior view we can still see the
deltoids because it's that really wide
fanning group of muscles right
so on the front side we get a view of
the anterior and medial fibers and on
the back side of the posterior view we
get a view of the medial and posterior
fibers
and now we can also start to see the
latissimus dorsi from a couple angles
and we can see how big that muscle group
is it's gigantic
and we can see right above it which
looks like it might be part of the lats
but it's actually covered up by the lats
so in this picture we actually have to
cut the lats
away or cut some of the muscle like the
trap away just to actually even see that
teres major which looks very very
similar and plays a very very similar
role
slightly different so if you haven't
seen these before this is just meant to
introduce you to where these are on the
body
hopefully you've seen some more anatomy
stuff before then before this lecture
all right let's go on here's just a
friendly reminder again of some of these
movement terms and i just want to
reinforce them because this is what
we're talking about today we're talking
about shoulder
so if i want to talk about shoulder
flexion that would mean from anatomical
position
moving my arm straight out in front of
me like so
right so kind of like doing a front
raise type exercise
if i was to do shoulder extension it
would be the opposite of that i'd be
moving back towards anatomical position
and i can even hyper extend my shoulder
pushing it back beyond the resting
position
so flexion is kind of up extensions
all the way back towards the midline
right on the other hand we can do
abduction and adduction so i like to say
ab duction or
adduction because they sound so similar
a b duction is to abduct to take away
so that would be my arm moving away from
the midline of the body
a deduction like adding would be to add
it back
to the midline of the body so away back
to the midline
we can also do medial and lateral
rotation so lateral rotation would be
moving my arm
or my humerus and rotating it away from
the midline medial rotation would be
moving my arm
back towards the midline of the body so
away back towards
and then one kind of unique movement
that we can see with the shoulder
is this weird circumduction so the name
circum
circle is kind of a circular motion
where i can actually rotate my arm
360 degrees basically if i could not
quite 360 but pretty close right
so this is a combination of doing both
flexion extension abduction adduction
and some rotational characteristics so
it's kind of a hybrid of all of them
and it's one of the few joints that can
actually do that really effectively so
it's kind of unique so we can see
the shoulder is actually capable of the
circumducting moment movement from front
to back or the other way around
okay just want to be clear on those
terms so
one thing that i think a lot of people
get confused about when we're talking
about movements of the shoulder is when
things
become not necessarily in the
prime typical anatomical direction
one of the problems that we see a lot is
people get confused when we move into
horizontal movements whether i'm lying
supine
and doing a horizontal movement or
standing up and doing horizontal
movement
so i think one thing to keep in mind is
always keep those directional terms in
the back of your mind
so a lot of people will say like well
this is always abduction right
not necessarily right abduction means
away from the body so if i'm actually
lying
on my back right abduction would be to
actually move
away like this so a lot of people just
say like well the upward phase is
abduction right
what about like a bench press or
something like that if i'm doing a bench
press
the upward phase is actually adduction
in the horizontal direction why because
my humerus started out to the side and
is now moving towards the midline
so one thing to keep in mind is just
don't always take the
diagrams as your only understanding
right you should understand
things like abduction and adduction from
their definition standpoint meaning
either moving away or towards the
midline and then when you see something
funny like a horizontal movement
you can say okay is it moving towards or
away from the midline ah now i can
properly identify this movement
and not just base it on the pictures
that i've seen right all right
going on the next one here's that graph
again or table i should say
and now we kind of get a pretty good
idea all right so if i'm doing these
different movements of the humerus
there is a corresponding movement of the
scapula
excuse me and clavicle as well so again
they're coordinated
if i'm doing abduction right it's not
just my humerus movement around
it's this entire girdle between my
scapula my clavicle the humerus right
this whole thing is moving around
and there's a corresponding movement of
all those uh
soft and hard tissues so good thing to
reinforce
good thing to always look at and it's
going to come back and help us out in a
little bit here
so let's move on now i just want to give
you some examples of things that you'll
see in exercise and sporting context
one of the problems that a lot of people
will have is they'll see an exercise
or they'll see a sporting movement and
the first thing they want to do is
figure out like which muscle groups
those are being
which are which muscle groups are being
used so that you can go and train them
more right obviously
the problem that we see a lot of the
times is kind of a miss or
identification or an improper
identification of what is actually going
on
in that movement thus leading to an
improper diagnosis of which muscle
groups are being used or how to train
so one of the things we want to figure
out right is what is the actual
movement that is occurring is the person
abducting are they flexing are they
extending
are they internally rotating medial
rotation ladder rotation
what's going on well if we can figure
out and describe accurately
what those movements are now we can go
and reference those handy tables that i
put together for you
and figure out okay well if this
movement is occurring
i know that only a certain group of
muscles are responsible for generating
that movement
therefore i can figure out which muscle
groups they are and which muscle groups
i can train to make them stronger right
so for example if the shoulder or the
humerus in this
particular instance is internally
rotated it is
likely that the subscapularis is
contributing to that movement
because internal rotation is one of its
primary actions
right so that's kind of the process in
which we want to go through and identify
first we have to figure out what is the
actual movement
then we start to think about okay well
which of the muscles that i know of
can generate that movement at least in a
concentric way
so we can apply the same process to the
prime movers and supporting muscles and
structures
of all sporting and exercise movements
so let's go on to this next one
first example easy one hopefully right
lateral raise so we have the dumbbell
lateral raise we start at the side
work our way out up to about 180 degrees
with a clavicle or so roughly the same
so what are the correct
movement terms and this today we're
talking about the shoulders we're going
to focus on that
what are the correct movement terms
going on here any guesses
all right first off we got some shoulder
abduction going on right so we started
at the side
moved away from the midline well if i
know it's abducting i can figure out
which muscles actually contribute to
shoulder abduction
let's take a look so what would some of
the agonist muscles be
well probably all the deltoids to some
capacity the anterior medial and
posterior
medial deltoid probably taking a big
brunt of them and we might see some
contributions from the supraspinatus
why because those muscles contribute to
shoulder abduction
now tricky question can you describe the
downward motion
for me think about
now what you should be thinking about is
not only our directional terms but also
our muscle contraction terminology
at the same time so would it be accurate
to say the downward phase
is adduction yes it is you're still
moving
towards the midline of the body right
would it be appropriate then to say that
if i'm adducting
after doing this lateral raise that i am
using
my shoulder adductors oh this is where
it gets tricky
not quite so in this case what we're
actually seeing
is the downward phase is still being
controlled
by the ab ab adductors now they are
doing that eccentric muscle contraction
they're generating force
and they're lengthening although they
are moving towards the midline they are
technically adducting
the abductors are still the primary
muscles involved
in controlling that movement now the
adductors can play a role in stabilizing
that movement and giving some
co-contraction
but in this case right the big movers
are still even on the downward phase
are still going to be the a a b ductors
the abductors so it gets a little tricky
so we want to make sure we're also
thinking kind of about vector analysis
gravity control all those things like
that so in the lateral rays
our prime movers are generally the
medial deltoids and a little bit of
assistance from
the other deltoids as well and the
supraspinatus and
on the way down even though we're doing
adduction we're coming back
those same muscles are still controlling
the movement with an eccentric
muscle contraction makes sense if that's
not making a lot of sense
go back and review the muscle
contractions we talked about in the
first lecture series and i think that
will help you understand this a little
bit better
if not post those questions on rp plus
and we'll get you going
all right let's look at the next one lat
pull down
one that we see all the time so can we
describe
the movement terms accurately in the lat
pull down
let's take a crack at it so what do we
have we see some shoulder extension
and then we're also seeing a combination
of scapular depression
and downward rotation right cool well
if i know that i can figure out which
muscle groups can do those actions right
now it's called the lat pull down folks
hopefully it's not rocket science here
right
but which muscle groups are involved
well certainly no brainer the latissimus
dorsi that's going to be
really really big generator of the force
for this movement it's going to be
helping pulling that
shoulder down into extension and pulling
it back right
but we're also going to see some
contributions from the teres major
probably a little bit from the lower
traps and the rhomboids as well
as we pull our scapulas back into
position at the bottom end of that
movement
makes sense see how we're kind of
breaking it down where we say there's a
movement
i'm not sure what's going on can i
identify what's happening appropriately
at the shoulders
yes can i identify the muscle groups
that generate that action
yes i can't absolutely all right next
one
bench press again only performed on
mondays national bench day
what are the correct movement terms well
in this case this one's a little goofy
because now we have a horizontal
component we're kind of outside of our
traditional
anatomical position right so what we're
actually seeing is we're starting
with the arms out at the sides and
moving towards the midline as they come
up right so in this case we're actually
seeing horizontal adduction
as our prime action here right so we're
going arm started at the side
and essentially our finishing close to
the midline that's horizontal adduction
and then we're also going to see as we
come up typically some scapular
protraction as well
now most of you know with really good
bench technique you don't want to
completely protract your scapulas out
but it's a normal part of the movement
in order to generate this horizontal
adduction i have to protract my scapulas
out a little bit right
so now that we've identified the
movement can we figure out
the agonist muscles involved of the
shoulder absolutely so we know that the
pec major hopefully is no brainer just
like the lat pull down pac major is
going to be involved in that bench press
we also know that that deep pec minor is
going to be involved and then to a small
extent we're probably going to see some
synergy with the anterior deltoid as
well
makes sense hopefully not too
challenging those are good exercise
examples
let's do a sporting example one of my
favorites
spinning back fists yes you guys like
mma
kickboxing muay thai yes all right so
what's going on here in this example so
our exercise examples are pretty cut and
dry make a lot of sense right this one's
kind of wacky
so let's use that same approach to
figure out what's going on with the
spinning back fist
so what are the correct movement terms
well essentially i am starting from
probably a fighting position
and then i'm moving my arm out and
across
right so i'm moving away from the
midline of the body
i'm horizontally a b ducting abducting
out
and in order for me to horizontally a b
duct
i have to also retract my scapula so now
i know what the movement terms are can i
figure out which muscle groups are
involved
absolutely so we know that the posterior
delt is going to be a big part of that
the latissimus dorsi the rhomboids and
then probably several sections of the
trapezius
are going to be contributing to that
whipping arm around movement
as i try and punch that other guy in the
face right
make sense so this is just a basic
example of things that we're going to
keep talking about
in our movement anatomy series we
started with the shoulder it's really
complicated
and we're going to work our way down so
next time you see me we're going to talk
about the elbow
so thanks for joining me today rp plus
rpu it's been a pleasure
i will see you next time
