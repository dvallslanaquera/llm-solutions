how long does it take for muscle growth
to plateau
according to this 2017 review study out
of the usa it plateaus quicker than you
think
based on an array of experiments
examining the time course of muscle
growth the authors make some bold
statements
regarding the lower body muscles they
say
these studies support the hypothesis
that a large percentage of an
individual's muscle growth potential
will likely be achieved within the first
three months of training
they go on to say it seems unlikely that
individuals will increase their muscle
mass by appreciable amounts beyond what
is gained by the time of plateau
regarding the upper body they say
initial statistical change in muscle
size from baseline often occurred prior
to weeks four to six of training
with a plateau three to four weeks after
this initial response they go on to say
it can be expected that muscle growth is
unlikely to meaningfully increase
further in a trained population
many would agree these statements seem
extraordinarily surprising and perhaps
controversial
in this video we're going to examine the
research behind these statements with
the aim of answering the question
does master growth plateau far quicker
than we think
let's get into it
[Music]
let's detail some of the research that
led the authors of that review study to
make the statements they did
first we have this 1999 study out of
japan which had 37 untrained individuals
perform these exercises with these
training variables
both the men and women of the study saw
a significant drop-off in quadriceps
development by the eighth week of
training
furthermore
the men in the study saw notable
drop-offs in biceps and triceps growth
by week eight
while the women in the study also tended
to see a triceps growth plateau by the
eighth week a 2011 study out of the usa
had untrained mentoring the leg press
and leg extension with these training
variables
an established thigh growth tended to
level off after six weeks of training
a 2013 study out of brazil had subjects
trained eccentric leg extensions with
these variables
and found directors for morse growth
tended to level off at the eight week
mark
a 2015 study out of england had subjects
trained leg extensions with these
training variables
and found the vastus lateralis grew well
from week zero to week three it did not
really grow much further from week three
to week 6.
now
progressive overload was applied in
these studies so a lack of progressive
overload cannot explain the plateaus
[Music]
the studies just overviewed are highly
interesting and collectively support the
author's conclusions
that muscle hypertrophy shows signs of
plateauing and notably dropping off
within three months
yet are there studies opposing this
there are two
a study out of japan all the way back
from 1970 had untrained men trained
maximal isometric biceps contractions
with these training variables and found
muscle growth did not show signs of
plateauing across 100 days
another 1996 study out of switzerland
had untrained men trained leg extensions
with these training variables
quadriceps growth continued to increase
consistently across six months of
training
thus we do have some data indicating
muscle growth shows no signs of
plateauing within three months despite
this opposing data the other study
suggesting muscle growth levels of
notably within three months still exist
because the results are so surprising i
know it can be easy just to ignore the
data and pretend it does not exist
however
this is not good scientific practice so
i don't believe we should discard or
ignore them
rather i think we should assess them a
little further and try to evaluate their
limitations
and as we'll see in a second there are
notable limitations with the data and
from them we can derive some useful
conclusions that can help you yourself
limit plateaus
[Music]
a major limitation with the studies
observing signs of plateauing within
three months
is none of them mentioned factors away
from training and this includes
nutrition
given the subjects were previously
untrained and given no nutritional
instructions it's reasonable to assume
many were not eating optimally for
muscle hypertrophy
this matters as both caloric and protein
intake have been shown to modulate the
amount of muscle growth you experience
a 2002 study out of the usa had
previously untrained men weight trained
for eight weeks
and found subjects consuming a 2000
calorie surplus gained around three
kilograms in body mass
and virtually all of this was fat free
mass
another group eating at approximately
calorie maintenance saw much lower
changes in body and fat free mass
a 2019 study out of brazil found in
competitive bodybuilders higher calorie
consumption around 6500 calories
produced greater muscle mass gains
versus a lower calorie consumption
around 4 500 calories
this review study summarizes calorie
surplus recommendations for untrained
and trained folks
protein intake is also notable
this 2018 meta-analysis out of canada
observed on the basis of 49 studies that
intakes up to 1.6 grams of protein per
kilogram of body weight enhanced
fat-free mass gains
with all this in mind we may arrive at a
different interpretation of the studies
finding signs of plateaus within three
months namely the data may demonstrate
untrained individuals can see
significant muscle growth while not
optimizing variables outside the gym for
three months or so
but to experience appreciable
adaptations further
optimizing variables outside the gym
nutrition being a critical one here
likely becomes progressively more
important
another limitation of the studies
demonstrating muscle growth plateaus
within three months
is that there was minimal variation in
the training variables used
except for the fact progressive overload
was applied
all other variables including exercise
selection volume and rep ranges were
maintained
exercise selection is potentially a
notable one
all the studies had subjects trained
their muscle groups with largely only
one exercise
it's possible training a muscle group
with a few different exercises in a
program is beneficial for sustaining
long-term gains
but more research is needed to verify
this
at the very least though performing a
few different exercises per muscle group
in a program does tend to grow more
regions across that muscle
demonstrating this is a 2021 study out
of brazil
a non-varied group performed the same
exercises for their muscle groups across
three sessions per week
a varied group on each of the three days
per week performed different exercises
per muscle group
before and after eight weeks of training
growth of the upper middle and lower
regions of the rectus femoris vastus
lateralis elbow flexors and triceps was
measured
overall
though gains in some regions were
similar between groups the varied groups
or more gains in other regions
thus
exercise variety can cause growth in
more regions of a muscle
with regards to rep ranges training with
a single rep range potentially could be
sub-optimal for hypertrophy
now
most studies lasting 12 weeks or less
find muscle growth to be similar between
training with a single rep range or
using a mix of different rep ranges
but one study with a 9-month duration
recruited previously untrained women
with one group using the same rep range
across three sessions per week
and another group varying their rep
ranges across three sessions per week
ultimately
increases in fat free mass were greater
for the group varying their rep ranges
now i should mention this is a single
study and more research is needed to
verify whether varying rep ranges truly
promotes greater muscle growth in the
long term
volume in the form of sets performed is
also a notable factor
there's emerging research suggesting in
trained individuals modestly increasing
the number of sets performed enhances
muscle growth
for example a study from usa had trained
men who back squatted an average 165
kilograms trained their quadriceps with
a variety of weakly set numbers
fundamentally their results established
that those who grew their anterior thigh
the most were the individuals who
performed an average six more weekly
sets for the quadriceps compared to what
they were doing before the study
lower responders less individuals who
grew their anterior thigh less only
performed one to four more weekly sets
for the quadriceps compared to what they
were doing before the study
[Music]
another 2022 study out of brazil
recruited trained men and had them
trained the unilateral leg extension and
unilateral leg press twice per week for
eight weeks
with one leg each subject individually
performed 20 percent more weekly sets
for their quadriceps than what they were
doing before the study
with their other leg all subjects
performed a prescribed number of weekly
sets for the quadriceps this was 22
weekly sets
it was found vastus authorized growth
was greater for the leg performing 20
more weekly sets
so a progressive increase in weekly sets
20
seems to be beneficial for muscle growth
an interesting point is for eight out of
the 16 subjects the prescribed number of
22 weekly sets was actually more than 20
percent of the weekly sets they'd been
performing for their quadriceps before
the study
it ranged from being 30 to 120 more
weekly sets than usual for these
subjects
yet
results still favored the leg that
performed 20 percent more weekly sets
this finding emphasizes that larger
jumps in the weekly sets 30 to 120
percent are not necessarily better than
more modest 20
increases in weekly sets for muscle
hypertrophy
therefore these two studies suggest
modestly increasing the number of sets
you perform may be an extremely
effective way to get past plateaus
all of the studies finding signs of
plateaus understandably had subjects
trained week after week
yet as we've explored in a previous
video there's some research suggesting
training breaks may be effective for
restoring responsivity to training and
perhaps enhancing long-term muscle and
strength gains
for example
this study from japan had mentoring the
barbell benchmarks with these training
variables
one group trained for 24 weeks straight
a continuous group while another group
trained for six weeks rested for three
weeks and repeated this for a total 24
weeks a periodic group
ultimately growth of the triceps and
pectoralis major as well as bench press
one rep max strength gains ended up
being similar between both groups
this was possible because the continuous
group rate of gains gradually slowed
down in other words they were nearing a
plateau whereas the periodic group
despite losing muscle and strength
during the three-week breaks gains
muscle and strength at faster rates
during their training weeks
the training breaks taken by the
periodic group may have re-sensitized
their body
thereby explaining their faster rate of
muscle and strength gains during the
training weeks
for more details on training breaks
check out the full research breakdown we
did on it
but i should mention more research is
needed to truly establish the
effectiveness of training breaks but the
current research is promising and an
individual may wish to experiment with
it depending on the interpretations of
the data as well as their feelings on it
in summary we do have research showing
muscle growth may show signs of
plateauing within three months of
training
yet i don't believe this data proves
muscle growth truly plateaus in this
time period
rather i believe the data demonstrates
an untrained person can see great gains
while not worrying about dialing in
other factors for three months or so
but to experience further appreciable
gains dialing in other factors such as
calorie and protein intake becomes
progressively more important with
training experience
as we know the subjects in the mentioned
studies likely did not optimize
nutritional factors
moreover training factors also matter
exercise and rep range variation are
potential strategies for better
long-term gains
though more research is needed to
validate this
emerging evidence also suggests that
modestly increasing the number of sets
you perform may be helpful for getting
past plateaus and enhancing muscle
growth
finally
training breaks could be beneficial for
re-sensitizing your body to training
stimuli
due to everything we've overviewed in
this video
needless to say i don't agree with the
conclusions of the review study we
mentioned at the start of the video with
a well-designed training program and
lifestyle i think it's very likely
individuals can see appreciable muscle
development across numerous years
moreover we see this in the real world
individuals can see notable improvements
despite having numerous years of prior
experience
