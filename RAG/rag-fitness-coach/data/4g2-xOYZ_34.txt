yes so the first sets like a
potentiation you've done that in a power
up thing I'm sure work up to something
either like 10% above your working load
or ride at the working load do a couple

that just to like Prime the nervous

actual working sets so now when he goes
back down to 315 for his working sets
it's just going to
float good stuff
