hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's video is about an
interesting psychological topic ooh
here we go
the title is think small the small and
the subtitle is the self-fulfilling
prophecy of natty gaintaning i'm just
firing off twitter shots at everyone
today
is that how twitter works is it all just
beef and at ing someone um i'm not on
twitter no no hold on i'm nominally on
twitter because i think my facebook auto
reposts to twitter i haven't checked
twitter in one and a half years there's
nothing on there for me uh anything i
have to say as you clearly know as a
subscriber to this channel is uh way
more than 280 characters
in any case here's the thing this is a
thing that happens
enough for me to make a video about it
i'll put it to you this way
there is an idea that some folks fall
into usually they are drug free which is
a very good thing
and they fall into this idea of well i'm
drug free and that means i can only gain
muscle
incredibly slowly
not totally inaccurate but could lead to
problems
and then they you know go follow some
other folks on social media and they
learn about gaintaining which is a
fucking stupid idea in most cases huh
huh if you want to be really jacked
and they go well fuck game changing
sounds really good and they think like
the following they say okay i read some
stupid blog and i realized that because
i'm natty and i've been training for two
and a half years stop the presses i can
only gain like a pound of muscle in a
year so what they do is they essentially
make a plan that plans to gain almost no
weight
because like why would you gain five
pounds
and then lose four pounds to only gain
one pound why not just gain like one or
two pounds or shit two pounds over the
year if you gain two pounds over the
year then maybe you can do a one week
fat loss phase a real mini cut mini mini
cut and lose the one pound and get a
pound net right
the result of this process is that you
gain barely any muscle at all because if
you start out pretty lean unless you
gain an appreciable amount of weight
gaining muscle requires simultaneous
burning of fat which is two different
largely antagonistic pathways and you
get a whole lot of nothing done and
once these folks not all of them many of
them they try to maintaining shit they
barely gain any weight on purpose
and
here's the self-fulfilling prophecy part
they go well fuck i barely gained any
muscle it's because i'm natty and they
scroll through their ends to feed and
they find people that are either have
good genetics or actually doing shit
right or on drugs or some combination of
three and they talk mad shit like at
guy who has muscle
steroids lol
you know insert
insert insult about sexual orientation
that's all i'll say i would quote them
for beta but that's gotten me in trouble
on instagram before
here's the thing there is another
alternative
you can do the following you can say
okay i'm natty
and it is what it is and i think maybe i
can gain five pounds of muscle this year
not one but five
for many people especially in years gee
three to six of your natty career i
think the average person can gain
something like gee close to five pounds
of muscle per year
a lot of people can gain more than that
but for the love of god very many people
dare i say most can gain five pounds of
muscle a year in their year two or three
to year six of training it's a thing
that's probably very likely if you look
at nati gain rates and all that stuff we
have another video on what you can
expect to gain who covers that in super
depth
and what this person might do
is over the course of 14 weeks
they plan to gain eight pounds okay
moving up eight maintain to drop fatigue
for uh four weeks or so and then over
the next six weeks they die down six
pounds
right
so that is a net gain
of you know oh i don't know
something like
you know well so hold on so they repeat
this twice throughout the year right
because it
only took up half a year each time
and
maybe
maybe is the result is that they gain
three pounds of muscle each time and
there's two of these phases in a year
and maybe that's like six pounds total
for the year
and
the reason that they gain this weight is
that they actually tried their best they
said okay i believe that i can gain
muscle and i'm gonna gain weight on
purpose slowly meticulously we're not
saying go on the fucking cookie diet and
blow up 50 pounds and cut off
you know 49 and have one pound left
nice easy slow muscle gain phase a
little maintenance phase a little mini
cut repeat that twice
and they actually tried to do it by
purposefully raising their body weight
which for anyone who's not a beginner or
not very over fat is the number one way
to ensure your best foot forward with
muscle gain purposeful gains and body
weight but you're not going to be 180
pounds jacked if you weigh 170 without
purposefully gaining weight unless
you're just a big eater and then you're
not gaining anyway because you're just
accidentally mass gaining
so
there is a possibility that you may just
gain one pound of muscle like you do the
mass you do the your maintenance you do
the mini cut it looks like you gained
almost no muscle and you do it again and
you just gained a pound okay
if that's the case and just over a year
of training you gain only a pound of
muscle
maybe it's time to
rework your nutrition or your training
maybe it's time to reconsider hobbies
because like fuck man if you're getting
a pound of muscle a year i don't know
man you could be you could have all
kinds of other physical hobbies you
could play ping pong you could play
table tennis wait same sport you could
play scott what's that shit old people
play uh
racquetball
badminton that's a fun sport
racquetball you can play all kinds of
racket sports
and
especially racquetball is a great place
to meet friends especially if they're
relatively wealthy 50 year old men which
i'm always into meeting i have expenses
folks and i'm in my 30s i don't have
that much money as you all know my
lamborghini fund is basically empty and
if i was to meet a uh gentleman several
maybe even in their 50s a little a
little silver daddy maybe he could uh
you know for an exchange of pictures of
me videos of me maybe even all sorts of
other services
double wink at the same time that we
could work out some sort of deal where i
get paid
uh i don't even know what the fuck am i
saying anyway
if you're getting a pound of muscle year
fuck
if you're a high level competitor and
that's just like what you're working
with cool otherwise maybe consider
switching hobbies going down to
maintenance volume and just enjoying the
fuck out of other parts of your life
but there's a very good chance that that
won't happen there's a very good chance
that you gain two three four five six
seven plus pounds of muscle in that year
and go god damn it if i had only done
this earlier and purposefully tried to
gain weight and didn't fall from the
main gaining bullshit or gaintaining
where the fuck it's called then i would
have not fucking spawned my wheels as
much and that would be a really cool
thing
don't let being natty
make you think that you're just gonna
gain ultra slow yeah eventually after
seven years sure but like if you run the
kitchen sink of gear after seven years
of running the kitchen sink you also
gain slow if there's no magic like you
know five grams of fucking steroids it's
not like well if we go up to six like i
don't know you might just die there's
like an even chance that that'll happen
don't let this become a self-fulfilling
prophecy where you shoot your goal so
low
that you're not even executing the
process that would result in your goals
being attainable if they were higher so
gain some fucking weight don't eat 14
pounds of cookies overnight but gain
weight slowly half a pound
a week or something like that it's
totally great get to a maintenance phase
after like three to four months do a
little mini cup for six weeks burn that
fat off see what you're working with do
it a few times you may very well be
ultra pleasantly surprised
and if you're really pleasantly
surprised maybe you can get down to the
racquetball courts and meet yourself a
silver daddy i'll be there i'll see you
there don't you fucking take my men from
under me if you come and try to seduce
the old man that i'm going to be trying
to say
i know jujitsu
i'll see you next time
