okay what is going on everyone uh so in
this video i'm gonna be speaking with dr
eric trexler and we're talking mostly
about why it is that our metabolisms
slow down as we lose body weight and how
we can prevent that metabolic slowdown
from happening and then we also talk
about what to do once the diet is over
so we can improve our recovery and
prevent excessive fat gain as we look at
the question of whether you should
reverse diet or just immediately
increase calories and enter a bulk right
away after the diet is over we also talk
about so-called starvation mode and
metabolic damage comes the idea that if
you dieted before and really suppressed
your metabolism then your metabolism can
become somehow damaged and so then that
can prevent you from losing weight down
the road so we talk about whether that's
a legitimate concept or not uh we also
talk about rapid weight loss or crash
dieting and a bunch of other surrounding
topics as well and i think that as you
guys will see eric is a really smart guy
he's published dozens of peer-reviewed
articles in scientific journals he's
also a pro natural bodybuilder himself
and a strength coach so he has a ton of
experience not only in the lab but also
in the gym himself and in working with
clients so i think that this is a
conversation you guys are really going
to enjoy and benefit from and also for
the record this is going to be available
on my podcast so if you just search for
the jeff nippert podcast on itunes or
stitcher and then you can find it over
there and i will have timestamps both in
the description box and in the comments
below so if you want to jump to whatever
topic that sounds most interesting to
you then feel free to hop around uh so
without further ado i hope you guys
really enjoy this conversation with dr
eric trexler all right so guys i'm here
with eric trexler eric thanks for being
here man yeah thanks for having me on
before we we hopped on the call here i
was actually looking at your research
gate i was trying to dig up that paper
you wrote i think was 2013 on metabolic
adaptation with with lane norton um
and i was scrolling down trying to find
it and i was like holy crap this guy's
been super busy the last few years
he published a lot of stuff
yeah yeah it's been very busy but um
but yeah i mean you probably saw in the
titles uh a lot of the papers are stuff
that
i'm just really interested in you know
like
doing stuff with bodybuilders doing
stuff with fat free mass index a lot of
really popular supplements so
it's easier to be busy when the topics
are
are relevant and really mean something
to you you know
when was it that that paper came out um
i never did end up getting all the way
down
to it
uh so that came out in 2014 okay it's
actually the first paper that i wrote as
a grad student
yeah i really remember it because at i
think i remember
if not the day it came out like the week
it came out because it was so
hot at that time in the community so
controversial because everyone was
arguing then about metabolic damage and
metabolic slowdown and all this stuff
and that was kind of like
the paper that sort of addressed it and
clarified things from a scientific
perspective so you say yeah i mean it's
funny that you say that because i just
wrote a big article i don't know when
it'll come out on uh stronger by
science.com but i kind of mentioned that
like there was a minute there where this
stuff seemed controversial but it just
really isn't you know what i mean
um
and so in the article i basically say i
refuse to acknowledge that this is
controversial in any in any way because
it's just not there's a lot of science
there
and i thought because it was such a
heated
kind of conversation at the time
when it got published and it was open
access so anybody could get to it i was
like some people are gonna be you know
really annoyed with it um but
if you kind of
take a very objective look at it there's
really not a lot of controversy there
and so there was not
no one kind of messaged me and said
you're an idiot or anything like that
which is always good
that was deflected onto other people on
other message boards probably yes yeah
well and it was deflected to people
that were either not being careful with
the claims they made or weren't being
really nuanced with how they framed it
um so you'd start getting very
sensational kind of interpretations of
it and that's where it starts to get
controversial right right i find it
interesting because now here like five
years later you're pretty much the guy
to go to on all these issues with
metabolism and metabolic slowdown and
and all this stuff and i guess it all
started with that paper
yeah yeah i mean i i wouldn't i wouldn't
claim to be the guy i'm one of the guys
there's i mean i'm pretty sure lyle
mcdonald's been writing about this since
i was in high school yeah um you know
lane
knows a ton about it eric helm so i'm
one of the guys but it it's certainly a
topic that whenever people bring me on a
podcast it comes up a lot yeah i've seen
you on a few of them so just to get
everybody up to speed here we're going
to be talking about mostly weight loss
and basically what happens to your
metabolism and your body more generally
as you lose weight and how to prevent
bad stuff from happening so you can
continue to lose weight and then after
that i'd like to focus on
what to do after the diet is over so as
to like either maintain that level of
leanness or not have this suppressed
metabolism
you know at least to the best of your
ability so
um before we do that let's get everyone
up to speed on the metabolic adaptation
paper and we can kind of use that as the
framework to then move forward in terms
of how the the literature has progressed
from there and then move into practical
applications so maybe you can just lay
out
the components of metabolism so
everyone's on the same page with that
and then how is it that metabolism
changes as you start to lose weight
yeah so um
components of metabolism let me knock
that out first
when we look at metabolic rate we're
looking at a combination of things it's
resting metabolic rate
uh the thermic effect of feeding
uh we're looking at exercise activity
thermogenesis calories we burn
exercising and then non-exercise
activity thermogenesis
which is often called meat
um so those are the component components
of metabolic rate now when we lose
weight
um we will expect that our total energy
expenditure the sum of those components
will go down
and there's
you know
body mass is metabolically active so if
we have less body mass especially lean
mass we would expect a lower rate of
metabolism
but what we see in the literature pretty
consistently and this is why i say it's
really not controversial
is when people lose a substantial amount
of body body mass their total energy
expenditure drops more than we would
expect it to
um and and that's accompanied by changes
uh that we talk about in that review
paper that go all the way from the brain
down to the mitochondria so i mean huge
control centers of the brain that are
tremendously influential in everything
we do all the way down to you know
microscopic components of our cells
so basically you start losing body mass
you start to see some hormone changes as
a result um
anyone that's been through a pretty
rigorous diet kind of has felt these um
these are hormones that control our
energy expenditure certainly but they
also control our
uh you know hunger our ability to build
muscle uh reproductive side effects when
you start to get really lean
so we see this whole milieu of hormonal
changes and ultimately drops in
metabolic rate
and those drops in metabolic rate
[Music]
you know the thermic effect of feeding
goes down because you're eating less
food that's kind of what you signed up
for when you diet
we see changes in muscle efficiency that
could affect exercise activity
thermogenesis
we see small changes in resting
metabolic rate for sure
some of those are due to adaptation some
are due to just being in a deficit at
that time
and then certainly non-exercise activity
really takes a huge hit so when you look
at the truly adaptive component of
metabolic adaptation that's where
non-exercise activity thermogenesis
really is uh the primary one that we
focus on
so to put it in kind of a
nutshell
we expect metabolic rate to go down as
we lose weight but there appears to be
an adaptation that takes place that
makes us more efficient at burning
calories
and
intuitively it seems like it's
essentially a response to prevent
starvation you know there's
an evolutionary basis by which we would
want to be more efficient with energy
when we start to
uh either have
acutely low energy availability and you
know as far as our body knows it means
we can't find food and we're kind of
screwed
and then certainly when our body fat
stores get low
that means we've been unable to find
food for quite a while and that is a
very direct threat to our survival as an
organism
right right um a couple of things there
i'm just going to recap real quickly
one thing that came to mind is people
are often under this assumption that
smaller people have have faster
metabolisms and and bigger chubbier
people don't but i would say all else
equal a bigger body is going to mean
more
energy expenditure in general right so
as you lose mass and as you lose weight
your metabolism is going to get
slower just simply as a function that
you have less
energy
expending mass available
absolutely yeah i mean
in my lab over the last six years i've
measured resting metabolic rate
a billion times
and
the one thing that can help me guess
about where it's going to be is just
your body size and
resting metabolic rate really there's
not a huge window of fluctuation it
pretty much is mostly determined by your
body size so when someone uh you know we
did a study with uh
uh
people undergoing bariatric surgery
weight loss surgery who were very large
and uh
their resting metabolic rates were quite
high you know what i mean and then
so yeah the idea that like you know
people who are bigger or have more body
fat that it's because their resting
metabolic rate is low uh there's really
not a lot of evidence to support that
right right so
when you diet you have this
first thing which is just that you're
getting smaller so you have
a slower metabolism simply as a function
of that but then you also have this
adaptive component so it actually slows
down more than you'd expect just on the
weight loss alone right and you're
saying you're saying that most of this
slow down is probably attributable to
neat which i've talked about here before
but it's basically anything that burns
calories that's not formal exercise
right it's activity but it's not actual
exercise
yeah without question neat is it's not
the only thing that adapts but it's it's
the biggest overall influential factor
right right um so so that should be a
pretty good recap you said you also have
uh
exercise activity activity thermogenesis
takes a bit of a heat or a bit of a hit
because your body
becomes more efficient while exercising
doesn't burn the same number of calories
and then obviously the thermic effect of
food even though that's kind of a small
slice still takes a hit because you have
less food coming in so you're going to
burn less calories digesting that food
yeah and i think that pretty much
accounts for
all the factors that contribute to slow
down
i would say pretty closely
yeah i mean there's a little bit of a
reduction in resting metabolic rate
right right um but
a lot of that basically disappears once
you're at
weight maintenance or once you're at
you're you know no longer in a calorie
deficit we see that that
basal or resting metabolic rate
component picks up pretty quick right so
so how long does it take for these we'll
call them negative adaptations to happen
does it happen you know one week into a
diet or 12 weeks in or is there any way
to predict when you're going to start to
see this slow down
um
so they have there's a lot of different
changes that occur and they all change
they all occur over different time
courses
so um
you know some of these things you know
you'll start to see acute hormone
changes within hours of going into a
calorie deficit you know
um
when you look at leptin that's the
hormone that is
without a doubt the most influential
hormone when it comes to metabolic
adaptation
leptin tends to fall off
really precipitously within the first
four or five days and then it kind of
starts to flatten out it still continues
to drop but there's two very clear
phases there's like the first week or so
where leptin completely drops off
and then it starts to drop at a much
more
linear kind of slope
other things kind of increase as the
duration of the diet goes on
especially as you get leaner and leaner
and leaner
and so you know things like
as as a male reproductive
side effects you know kind of that low
testosterone
that's very common to see
you can get away with with dieting for a
while before that starts to really
really hit you um at least in my
experience and you know looking at
research as well but
that's one of those ones that over time
the leaner you get the more the weight
loss is going forward the longer you've
been in the deficit that's where you
start to see testosterone really start
to drop off so
some of these things take hours some
take days some take
months right
in my coaching experience it seems to be
it almost seems to be an individual just
based on the anecdotes i've seen it's
like some people i can put them in a
pretty you know reasonable deficit like
20 or whatever and
they
lose weight fine on that up until a
certain point like if they're a guy
maybe when they hit
seven or eight percent body fat then it
just like all of a sudden it's like
things really start to slow down whereas
with some people it almost seems like
right away as soon as they start the
diet it's like you immediately have to
start
increasing or lowering the calories
almost right away because their
metabolism seems to adapt very quickly
is that something you've you've noticed
yourself is there any literature to
support like individual differences in
metabolic adaptation
um
there's a great deal of research
looking at kind of the inverse of that
so looking at when we over feed people
some people are tremendously resistant
uh
to weight gain
and what we'll see is their energy
expenditure just goes through the roof
when we try to overfeed them i would
suspect that if you're training
reasonably well and trying your best to
eat a lot
um and failing to gain weight you're
you're you know you probably call
yourself a hard gainer
is that still a term people still say
that okay i think so i've been out of
the world for a while um
but i would imagine you know a hard
gainer who's really doing well and
failing to gain weight is probably one
of those people that when we over feed
you your energy expenditure goes up uh
quite a bit and and there is evidence to
indicate that the opposite is true that
that some people
seem to have this really tremendous
adaptive component when they start
losing weight
other people um really don't seem to
have as severe and an adaptive component
and
you know
they they're kind of looking around at
their peers going like why are you guys
struggling with this weight loss like
i'm doing fine um so i i'm not certain
if there's any research showing
that that's the same person
that the person who struggles to gain
weight
uh when overfed is also the one who
struggles to lose weight when underfed
but i would expect there's at least a
reasonable amount of carry over there
just in talking with people who've
coached
a large number of clients you know
they'll talk about how people that
really really suffer from the metabolic
adaptation during weight loss when they
start to overfeed them once they get
back to their normal body weight their
body really doesn't like to budge too
much above that
and i would speculate that
i'm probably
close to being one of those people um in
the sense that you know
my body you know i usually like to walk
around at like 175 or 180.
if i get
5 or 10 pounds below that i'm
immediately starving if i get five to
ten pounds above that it's like i cannot
get a bite of food in
um
now you can push through those cues
big time um you know i've dream dreamer
bulked and got huge and fat and gross
and like that was fine um i i felt
horrible the whole time because my
body's cues were just kind of saying
like dude this is it's too much for you
um and then at the same time when i die
it down um
you know
you kind of get to that place where your
body's saying okay i'm starving
and you can still push through that and
you can still lose weight it just it
sucks you know
um so so my i'm
my personal experience with it is that
i'm probably one of the people that
likes to stay in a pretty tight range
and i i kind of see
some adaptations going on in both sides
you can still push through those but but
they're there
right so let's narrow in on the
adaptation component now so is there a
way
or is there a series of ways that
you can reduce the amount of adaptation
so that you can continue to lose weight
or break through these stalls and so on
and so forth
uh yeah so there's
i would say whether you're someone who
adapts a lot someone who doesn't adapt
too much that certainly the goal should
be to attenuate it as much as you can
you know i i don't know
a lot of people that are completely
immune to this it's just exactly how
much
you're going to suffer from this
so there's two approaches you can deal
with the causes or you can
deal with the effects you know and
when it comes to dealing with the causes
what we're talking about there is
you know
basically that the things contributing
to this are how big is your energy
deficit uh how long have you been
dieting and how lean have you gotten
um
you'd like to keep getting lean so we'll
leave that one alone like there's not
much we can do about like
that's just it is what it is but
i would suggest that in terms of dealing
with the causes a couple things you can
do are
try to
have a slower rate of weight loss in
general so a smaller
acute deficit at any given time
i would expect the body to resist that
just a little bit less
and there's obviously
data showing that weight loss with
slower rates of weight loss tends to be
more favorable when we look at hormones
when we look at the loss of lean tissue
things of that nature
another thing you could do is implement
refeeds or diet breaks
um and they're they're both the same
kind of general idea is to take a break
from being in a deficit um let your body
kind of
do its thing at maintenance for some
amount of time and then you reintroduce
the deficit
a refeed is usually going to be
one or two days a week
whereas a diet break is going to be like
a week or even two weeks that you are
going back to maintenance calorie
consumption
the more i look at the data on it i
would say if you're doing a refeed thing
it's probably nice to do two refeeds in
a row
um
you know we talked about how long does
it take for metabolic adaptation to
happen
um we also have to consider if we're
doing these non-linear approaches how
long does it take
of being at maintenance to actually see
anything meaningful happen and i would
say one day's probably not enough
um
when it comes to diet breaks there's
some really cool there's a big study
called the matador study that got
published i think last year and what
they did was two weeks of dieting two
weeks of maintenance kind of on and off
and it did appear based on their data to
attenuate the magnitude of reduction and
metabolic rate
so i would say
dealing with the causes that's what you
can do take your time try to be
if you if you can afford
taking some pauses throughout diet
breaks seem to be a really good thing
for that
now dealing with the effects i'm sorry
were you going to say something yeah i
was just going to
pause on that for one second because i
i've
they covered that matador study i think
in the the mass research review which
you've you've written for and they
sponsor my channel so it's my
listeners should be familiar with it um
one of the downsides of
doing the diet break approach as opposed
to just the straight deficit approach is
that it took i think something like
twice as long to actually get there so
like at the at the end you did have
better outcomes in terms of you know
metabolic preservation or whatever you
want to call it and i think they
actually did see better fat loss as well
but it took them twice as long so it's
like if you're someone who doesn't want
to be dieting for for 24 weeks but
rather diet for 12 well maybe the diet
break approach might be slowing you down
in some sense right
yeah oh definitely it will if you spend
half your time at maintenance it's going
to take you twice as long yeah you know
um
so i think the the question there would
be what do you plan to do with this
weight loss
so if you're trying to induce anything
resembling sustainable weight loss
i would say take your time you know
what's the rush if if you're trying to
make this your new body weight for a
meaningful amount of time take your time
with it
put in the types of strategies that can
help you maintain that long term
now if you're dieting for 12 weeks
because you have a photo shoot and you
really don't care how rapidly that
weight comes back and you know three
weeks after your photo shoot you're
comfortable
with being right back to normal body
weight i mean you know i'm being uh
extreme there but
if you aren't trying to maintain this
for any meaningful amount of time i i
could see a case where you'd say screw
it it's going to be 12 pretty bad weeks
instead of 24 kind of bad weeks like
that makes sense to me i can get on
board with that so it just depends on
what you're trying to do right right
right um and i suppose it also depends
maybe on how lean you're actually trying
to get because just you know using
myself as an example like i can probably
get down to like maybe just below 10
uh body fat without really having to do
any diet breaks or having to suffer too
too much a reasonably low set point um
once i try to dig below
the eight percent zone
i feel like i would respond actually
much better to diet breaks and it's just
going to take me so much longer just
simply as a function of me wanting to
get leaner uh so it yeah it depends on i
guess where your end goal is also
yeah yeah i would say what you know what
you're
what body fat you're trying to get to
and also how extreme
uh the overall magnitude of weight loss
is going to be
um you know so
you're looking at you know how close to
that minimum like four or five percent
body fat level are you but also how far
away from your normal body weight are
you you know what i mean so so if you
were walking around
and you were like 360 pounds
uh and you're trying to lose really
substantial amounts of weight
that might be an instance where you'd
say you know we are just because of the
sheer magnitude of weight loss
the first portion sure just go ahead and
get rid of the weight quick but at some
point as you're really far below your
kind of settling point that you were
maintaining at that's where you might
say okay we've done the initial phase of
fat loss like you said getting down to
you know everyone's got a number i can
get down to this number very easily and
then maybe once you get there that's
when you would start implementing it and
you can kind of have the best of both
worlds where
you you make the quick progress that
doesn't hurt
and then once you start to get to the
kind of grinding portion
that's where you would implement
something like a diet break right right
in the studies they kind of have to
split them up into two strict groups but
in the real world you can say well i'm
gonna diet linearly with with no diet
breaks until i get to that sticking
point and then once i get there i can
use this as a tool sort of thing
yeah yeah um so i didn't want to
interrupt you too much there let's get
back to you so you addressed the the
strategies for the causes now you're
going to talk about the next part
yeah so so
once you kind of deal with what can we
do to actually attenuate the causes of
the problem then we start looking at
what are some of the peripheral effects
that we run into with the problem
um
and so
certainly based on the hormonal changes
we see
uh we're going to be concerned about uh
you know the potential loss of lean mass
um
looking at just the general state that
you're in physiologically we're going to
be concerned about performance
decrements
and you know if you spend
20 weeks
or 10 weeks in this really kind of
crappy grinding spot where your
performance totally sucks that's not
going to be a good thing for your
outcomes you know if you're trying to
you know
get ready for
something important where you want to be
pretty
pretty lean you know single digit type
body fat for for a male
it's not going to do any favors to train
like crap for the last
you know
10 weeks of that of that phase
so
i think slow rate of weight loss helps
there we know that slower weight loss
based on research and resistance trained
people seems to help with lean mass
retention it seems to help with
attenuating some of the hormonal changes
that we see
it helps with maintaining performance
so slow rate of weight loss deals not
only with the causes but also with some
of those downstream effects
even in people that aren't getting
particularly lean
certainly you want to make sure you have
an appropriate distribution of
macronutrients
when you start you know people worry
about their macros in the off season but
it's like wait until you're like late in
a diet and then
you start to see like
i don't know what to do with these
calories because like you know you want
to have enough fat to support you know
fat soluble vitamin absorption and even
hormone production
you certainly need enough protein to
support lean mass and you want enough
carbohydrate to support your training so
that's where the hard macro decisions
get made and that's where you have an
opportunity to distribute those
effectively and really help maintain
lean mass maintain performance
throughout the diet
smart training is critical
if if you
train yourself into the dirt and you
don't accommodate your impaired ability
to recover when you put together your
training you're probably going to regret
that and exacerbate some of these
problems
and that's where cardio comes into play
too
i know for me the the best prep i ever
had was when i did virtually no cardio
uh in
i kind of wasn't sure if i was prepping
until i was halfway through
but by the time i was halfway through i
wasn't doing any cardio anymore
and i just
kept it that way because i think a lot
of people
they think
okay well calories are low so i'll just
cardio my way out of this problem but
you know there's ample evidence of
endurance athletes where we see that
even in people that aren't intentionally
trying to lose weight lean people who do
really excessive amounts of cardio have
some of these metabolic adaptation
issues uh even in the absence of of
really extreme caloric restriction i
think a lot of people fail to account
for the fact that uh
cardio is not just negative calories
it's also a recovery burden
and if you're training in the weight
room like crazy
and you're doing cardio as if you're
like preparing for a marathon
something's got to give there like you
have to try to manage your recovery
and not eating and having sleep issues
which are like two common things in prep
like you don't have a lot of calories to
work with
a lot of people struggle to sleep well
recovery becomes a very very very
delicate balance there
right right
um
okay those are great so uh i'd like to
circle back and just touch on a couple
of those strategies in a little little
more detail so first i want to talk
about
rate of weight loss so you talked about
dieting slow being a good strategy for
not only preserving metabolic rate but
also
muscle mass yeah the slower you diet the
you know the better your metabolism will
probably stick around and your muscle
will stick around better as well
obviously we've already said the
downside is that you have to diet for
longer but that might be worth it just
again depending on how lean you want to
get or when your deadline is
so let's just uh maybe break down what
you would recommend in terms of a rate
of weight loss like how how many pounds
per week what's the size of the deficit
how many calories should you slash that
kind of thing
yeah
um it's tough i i think with rate of
weight loss and another thing to keep in
mind is that it probably
shouldn't be totally linear like you
should probably be able to afford a
slightly higher rate of weight loss at
the beginning than toward the end of a
diet
um
i believe
uh
the numbers off the top of my head i
suck with because i always like just
make spreadsheets you know like i'll
plug them in and then i'll just like
follow it um i believe
i usually recommend like at toward the
beginning of a diet like one percent of
body weight
um
let me double check my my number here
yeah no worries that that sounds like a
reasonable figure to me though one
percent yeah if you're 200 pounds that's
two pounds per week right yeah pretty
good
i would consider that to be like you
know pretty moderate to slow i would say
yeah yeah so pretty moderate i usually
as an average that's about where i'm
like comfortable saying like one percent
of weight per week
um
if you're doing a totally linear
approach sometimes i'm even cool with
going down to as low as a half a percent
per week toward the later end of the
diet and if you're starting at a pretty
high body fat
i could even be comfortable going a
little bit above one percent toward the
beginning
another thing to keep in mind is
if you're implementing refeeds and diet
breaks toward the end you can probably
keep it at one percent
during your weight loss kind of chunks
and then go to maintenance
and you know do whatever time you can
get a four you can afford to get away
with it maintenance and then go back to
one percent right so
i i usually
kind of cluster around one percent um
but it just it really depends on the
context of how much fat you have to lose
how long you've been dieting and whether
or not breaks are a part of that diet
process but yeah anywhere from half a
percent to one percent is kind of the
really nice conservative spot that that
i generally kind of
promote right um
article
lyle has a a pretty famous article on
this and i think he outlines it as rate
of weight loss according to a percent of
deficit so like say you maintain your
weight on 3000 calories if you slash
i think it's 10 to 15 percent of that
that would be like a slow rate of loss
and then i think 15 to 20 percent would
be something moderate and then 20 or 25
and above would be like a pretty rapid
it'd be a pretty big deficit right yeah
and then when you look at like
starvation studies it tends to it's like
50 deficits like literally slash
calories in half so yeah i feel like
somewhere in the like like you said uh
around one percent of body weight loss
per week or like maybe in the 15 to 20
deficit range is like probably a
reasonable ballpark for like more
moderate styles of weight loss
yeah i mean a lot of times what i'll do
is uh
kind of make sure we have a a pretty
good idea of what someone's maintenance
is
um
and if there's enough time to play with
just drop their caloric intake by kind
of a
based on their body size
250 300
400 calories and just kind of see
what kind of weight loss we're seeing
with that because you know even if you
put a number out there
what you'll find is that
based on how different people adapt in
terms of overfeeding and underfeeding
you might
put in a caloric deficit that you expect
a weight to just start falling off and
there's nothing and you have to kind of
nudge it forward again so there and a
lot of times when people come in and you
think you know their maintenance
you actually don't um you know basically
what you're seeing is that they adapt
quite well to overfeeding
so
what you're seeing is kind of an
inflated maintenance basically their
body is kind of firing all on all
cylinders to maintain and kind of
make this high caloric intake seem like
a maintenance if that makes sense
and so
you know we can see people whose
metabolic rate is a little bit lower
than predicted based on adaptive
processes we can also see that in the
other direction so for some people that
are basically
well adapted to kind of an overfeeding
type caloric intake
eric helms and i wrote a
an article about this in like 2014 that
like sometimes when people say oh i look
at this huge change in my
offseason intake compared to my prep
intake you're looking at adaptation that
happens in both directions
so sometimes people
are you know they're they start over
feeding and they completely ramp up
their metabolic rate and their
non-exercise activity and they probably
train a little bit harder
and what you'll find is that it's kind
of an inflated perception of what their
maintenance truly is so
i think i think you're on the money
there with with the numbers you're
putting out and but the problem is like
you want to make sure that as a
practitioner a coach an athlete whatever
that you have enough wiggle room in your
mental approach to acknowledge this
might not pan out the way i expect it
and adjust accordingly yeah that's such
a good point it's so common for me to
see it especially with men
who have these super high maintenance
calories in the off season like they'll
be like i maintain on 4 500 calories and
they're still decently lean in some
cases um and then they're ready to start
a cut and they're like okay i'm gonna
slash 400 calories bring that down to 4
100 and that's going to get me losing
and it just doesn't because it's like
you said it's so artificially inflated
beyond their true maintenance that they
need to come all the way down to like
i don't know 2 800 or something in some
cases just to actually get losing right
and and that isn't a huge gap below
their true maintenance it's just that as
you've said you know that they're what
their perceived maintenance is so much
higher than the true one
yeah yeah
it's super common it's funny that you
say that uh i haven't seen it in a while
but it's it's especially common with
these guys who who have super fast
off season metabolisms or super high
caloric intakes anyway
yeah and what you're seeing there is
that they're probably they're you know
even their resting metabolic rates
probably through the roof when they're
when they're feeding that way but also
like their non-exercise activity is
probably just insane they're probably
just like rocking in their chair
like their entire work day like and you
see it like you'll make that initial
drop and they just stop being that way
but there's really no you're not seeing
any weight loss happening you're like
what's happening yeah and and that's
that's probably what's going on yeah so
so true yeah um
well one thing i want to just bring up
here is it it's it so
basically as we're presenting it is is
i would say like the modern old school
way of looking at it it's like lose
really slow and progressively and you'll
preserve your muscle and preserve your
metabolism
recently as i'm sure you know things go
in fitness circles there's been more of
a push towards like well maybe crash
dieting and faster rates of weight loss
is okay you don't need to freak out
you're not going to lose all your muscle
you can get really lean doing this as
long as you wait train and so on and so
forth um
one guy who's been uh talking about this
a bit recently is martin mcdonald i
don't know if you're familiar with with
his work but i think he has done several
uh
uh
he's written several article several
articles and has uh
dieted quite quickly himself
and um
what's your opinion on that i mean like
how
how important is rate of weight loss and
how much of a risk for you know not only
metabolic effects but also muscle loss
is a faster rate of of weight loss
in reality
um
i think
generally i advocate slower rates um
martin knows his stuff so i'm not uh you
know
attacking his approach in any way but i
think when you look at the literature on
rates of weight loss um it generally
would either show
it doesn't matter or it favors slower
depending on the study you find
and you know
when we're talking about when the stakes
are high and all else is equal i would
say
why not lean toward the direction of
what we've seen to be favorable in a
number of studies uh when it comes to
uh you know
changes in hormones and metabolic rate
and muscle loss or lean tissue loss
um
although having said that um
i don't
think that a fairly rapid rate of weight
loss is absolute suicide
in terms of of making progress like
what we might see is
you still got down to five or six
percent body fat but instead of you know
you basically walked on stage with maybe
half a kilogram or a kilogram less of
lean mass or something like that
that's not necessarily the end of the
world
especially if you're not dieting down to
ultra low body fats and especially if
you're not competing with you know a
wnbf world title on the line so
if someone is either non-competitive or
just not super patient and says
i don't want to spend
40 weeks dieting or 30 something weeks
dieting let's do this thing in 14.
you can make that happen they will get
lean they'll probably have to
use a bigger deficit than they would
have otherwise
but it's doable and they're not going to
completely shrivel up
and lose all of their lean tissue so
it's a viable approach that can work
especially when the end goal is not to
get absolutely as lean as a person can
get with the most amount of muscle a
person could possibly have
and when you talk about bodybuilding and
physique competitions the goal is
depending on your class but if you're a
bodybuilder i want to be the most
muscular person could possibly be
with the smallest amount of body fat
possible while still being alive
and when that's the goal i think you
have to really constrain your approach
to what seems to be most supported by
the literature right
i could see even just from the
performance side of things like the the
faster you're
losing weight by definition you're in a
bigger deficit it's probably going to be
harder to maintain your strength and
performance in the gym which might be
really a negative thing just in its own
right and then also from a muscle muscle
preservation perspective um yeah yeah on
that note what is your general
recommendation for
training when
in a caloric deficit do you kind of not
really change anything do do you focus
how i should frame this is should you
focus more on keeping the weight on the
bar and keeping your your strength up or
should you focus on you know keeping the
volume the same once you get to that
point where you feel like your recovery
is compromised
um the the major change that i make um
once you're in that spot where
you reach a certain point in prep and
i'm sure you've been there where
glycogen just isn't part of your life
anymore you know what i mean
like you remember fondly a time where
your muscles did in fact have glycogen
in them in your liver but that's not
your reality anymore and at that point i
usually like to tone down the high
repetition work
um just because
i'm sure you've been there late in prep
you put on a load you're like okay let's
do 12 and then you hit seven and it's
weird there's just nothing in the tank
like you don't feel like the burning and
the acidosis or anything like that it's
just
your muscles tap out yeah you know
so
one thing that i like to do is
shift my training volume
more toward doing sets that are higher
loads with lower repetitions
if you can maintrain if you can
shift your your repetition range lower
and maintain the volume
fine that's good but at a certain point
i am
you know pretty willing to acknowledge
like hey my recovery just isn't what it
used to be it's probably time to try to
maintain the intensity and drop the
volume just a little bit to see if we
can preserve what lean tissue is there
now i know i have seen people advocate
the opposite and they say when i'm in
prep i like to do high rep stuff because
the injury risk is lower
um and
i could see both sides but for me i just
i don't like getting into those super
glycolytic rep ranges where you're
relying on glycogen that just simply
isn't there
i i actually totally agree with you um
it's it's
funny because most people recommend the
exact opposite it's like oh you're in a
cutting phase you need to bump up the
reps to start burning more calories and
so on and so forth but
from my perspective that's just not
going to create that same tensile
stimulus on the muscle that i think
heavyweight would and if you have this
reserved capacity for volume that you
can tolerate it makes more sense i think
to allocate more of that towards heavier
loads that are going to generate more
tension obviously not like power lifting
style like one to four rep stuff but i
think that more in that like you know
reasonable
five to ten six to twelve whatever zone
makes makes more sense to me and like
you said kind of start to like wean off
the the really ultra high rep stuff yeah
and i'm gonna make uh an analogy here
that is not based in science but it
feels sciencey enough but
when you look at someone with a really
high vo2 max
like an aerobic athlete and for whatever
reason they can't train for for a while
the way that they
everyone in sports since the dawn of
time has dealt with that has been to
maintain intensity in workouts and just
sacrifice the volume
generally speaking what you can see for
a broad range of training adaptations
and a lot of different modalities is
that the way to maintain things
you know look at like a team sport like
a you know like an american football
team
their in their time in the weight room
often gets cut down during the
competitive season the way that they try
to deal with that is to keep the
intensity high
and simply sacrifice some of the volume
at the ex you know
save the intensity sacrifice the volume
because you can't have both
so i think that as a very general
principle
i think the body tends to do pretty well
with maintaining adaptations
when we keep the intensity high even if
we can't necessarily keep the volume
quite as high completely non-scientific
very analogous but
it's a thing that we see in different
kind of components of exercise
literature yeah it makes sense and
there's i i think you can i think you
can pass that as a science-based i mean
there's sports physiology papers on on
that sort of
measuring those sorts of outcomes even
if there isn't something on
exactly what we're talking about i feel
like it's not a stretch to extrapolate
it um but before we move on to the post
diet stuff so like reverse dieting
bulking whatever um i'd like to have you
comment on starvation mode because i
feel like that's a concept that kind of
ties into a lot of what we've been
talking about here in terms of
metabolic slowdown
is that bro science or is there some
truth to it
so
yeah
my understanding of like starvation mode
is that to me it registers as just like
a very dramatic
interpretation of metabolic adaptation
um
basically people say oh i'm in
starvation mode so you know i can't lose
any more weight or i'm even gaining
weight despite the fact that i'm in a
deficit that stuff there's no um there's
no basis for that uh scientifically
um
i i still like
there are responses to semi starvation
that are measurable
and that make your weight loss a little
more difficult and we call that
metabolic adaptation
but but when it comes to starvation mode
there's not a single person on the
planet who is immune to starvation like
you'll never run into a thing where it's
like
oh jeff you look terrible you've gained
a lot of fat what happened it's like i
just stopped eating you know like
uh
yeah it was a rough time like no it's
never happened and there's never been a
person
who it's like
you know
their strategy for weight loss is i
better start eating more calories every
day that doesn't
that doesn't pan out you know
so the starvation mode thing like you're
not losing weight because you're eating
too little i will never get on board
with that
[Music]
yeah i i totally agree it's funny and
you do hear it sometimes like you will
hear people give that crazy
counter-intuitive advice uh to avoid
starvation mode but it just makes
absolutely no sense um
and all you have to do is look at people
who are actually starving on our planet
and they all look emaciated
well and like the thing that kills me is
like
you like dogs jeff
uh i don't have a dog myself but yeah i
like dogs
i don't have one either but i like them
yeah and talk to any dog owner and it's
like i went to the vet
and my dog's too fat
so what did the vet tell you to do
put another half cup in the morning like
no every when when it's not us it's very
easy to make the decision say oh well
the dog's too fat it's probably eating
too much so we'll probably give it less
food
like it's very straightforward when you
look at like agriculture literature of
like fattening up livestock it's never
been a difficult concept of like
if you want them to be less fat feed
them less if you want to be more fat
feed them more
so i i just
because eating is so ingrained into like
everything we do and because it's so
personal for us
we don't like to let it be that simple
so we're like oh it's i'm doing
everything i can so it's starvation mode
or something but no like just whenever
i'm in like whenever i'm like
trying to convince people it's like
think of your dog
when it's too fat you just give it less
food and it works 100 of the time
um
one thing that i ran into because i've
covered this before and i've kind of
talked about how
almost exactly what you just said how
starvation mode is kind of this like
sensationalist
term to
maybe describe like an extreme case of
metabolic adaptation that doesn't really
exist but if you soften the definition
of starvation mode enough
you might in fact
be able to see that it does describe
these groups of people who are on very
low calories yet still not losing weight
and to them it might seem really real
like i'm eating 1200 calories today as a
woman for example
and i i've completely stalled and i'm
not even that lean yet that really seems
like starvation mode to them right um
however you know as i'm sure you know
but that there are other explanations
for why they've stalled other than
starvation mode for one they're that you
know they're as we've talked about their
levels of neat have probably dropped
they probably used to be fidgeting a
whole bunch and walking to and from the
car more often they just avoid doing
that now subconsciously
and also there's a whole other issue of
water retention that we could get into
but it probably tends to exacerbate as
you get leaner and leaner and uh more
fixated on your weight loss that isn't
happening so
yeah i would say those are probably the
two main culprits for starvation mode um
in reality
yeah and the water retention thing is
huge man like
cortisol absolutely induces water
retention
and no one has more cortisol than
someone who's weight training like crazy
dieting doing cardio like crazy
like crazy and is stressed out
like that if you were trying to like
induce
high cortisol levels those would be your
main cards you would play
and i remember one of my preps in like
2013 i made a calorie drop nothing was
happening and i i was at first pretty
frustrated and then a few days into it i
was like okay i'm just gonna not enter
the gym for about four days
and immediately like multiple pounds
fell off at a time where i was just chip
it was like late in prep chipping away
at the last few pounds
and it was just this enormous drop in
weight that was yeah i was just
over trained
not recovering and stressing out too
much about it sometimes the best thing
for that with these people who think
they're in like starvation mode is like
the most counter-intuitive thing let's
eat maintenance for a couple days don't
go anywhere near the gym and let's just
wait it out and usually that helps out
quite a bit right okay so there's two
other topics that they're pretty big
ones that i want to cover yeah i think
we can do it in the next in the next 20
minutes
that's the challenge so the first one is
medical is that you being polite and
saying quit uh quit rambling no it's
actually just like i feel like there's
so
many more avenues i can explore with
what we've already done yeah i really
like talking about this stuff and it's
been a while i i've been focusing so
much on training on my channel recently
uh that it's it's a pleasure to talk
about nutrition and metabolic stuff
again um
but yeah also
keep it keep it quick
so so metabolic damage is a is basically
we talked about it earlier but what
sparked all this controversy to do with
metabolic adaptation to begin with so i
think that the metabolic damage claim if
you're gonna define it like i think in
the most sensible way
is that it's literally what it says your
metabolism gets damaged to the from
previous weight loss so you lost weight
now your metabolism is damaged so
you say you regain your weight back
because you have a slow metabolism now
it's going to be really difficult for
you to lose weight again because it's
like a permanent slow down in your
metabolism do you think first do you
agree on that that definition of it
nothing's permanent jeff
in any context right
but no i i can't no
metabolic down regulation is not
permanent it is recoverable but more
egregious down regulations with very
egregious approaches to weight loss can
take more effort to induce recovery more
effort and more time
right right okay that makes sense so
what what is the the time course for
that recovery generally speaking
well recovery is multifaceted it
involves you know bringing hormones back
to normal levels restoring
components of both
lean tissue and fat tissue
getting metabolic rate back to normal
and total energy expenditure back to
normal
i would say
in the interest of being concise for
most physique athletes that are doing
things pretty logically you start to see
pretty sufficient recovery within four
to six months after a competition just
looking at case studies and looking at
some small studies in groups of people
there are aspects that take longer to
recover
even
one of the things that's like really
hard to recover and and often takes a
very long time is restoring normal uh
menstrual cycles and female competitors
and it's not a typical to see that take
uh
over a year
to come back and be fully regular
um so the time course depends on how
lean you got how rapidly you regain your
weight
um
how you manage your training load after
the weight loss phase there's a lot that
goes into it but i'd say
within the first four to six months a
lot of the recovery happens assuming
that you're not clinging to like
competition level body fat
um
but beyond that there are some aspects
menstrual cycle regularity um
restoring kind of a normal
i hate to use this kind of cliche term
but a normal relationship with food
and kind of re
re-uh
uh becoming more reacquainted with what
it feels like to have some fat on your
body psychologically a lot of times that
takes even a little more time right
on the metabolic damage point so
there's still a lot of people who
believe in this it was more in vogue to
believe it four or five years ago
people who were proponents of this
basically had two lines one was there's
some rodent research showing that the
fat cells have memory so basically if
you dieted to a really low level of body
fat before
you remember that and your body prevents
it in the future i don't know if that's
ever been shown in humans but there was
whatever there was that in rats and then
also there are all these anecdotes of
especially women who dieted to very low
levels of body fat put the weight back
on and now all of a sudden really
struggle to get it off again so
if
metabolic damage doesn't explain that
what what does and why do you think
metabolic damage doesn't explain it
um
i think
probably
so we look at a case of someone who has
more body fat than they expected and is
struggling more than they thought with
weight loss
so you know we talked about during the
weight loss phase what might be
contributing to that
it could be
water retention related issues
inappropriate management of the training
load it could be even sometimes people
aren't as good as they thought at
tracking their calories
those are things that could acutely
explain it when it comes to the
long-term stuff like we do see that uh
whether it's you know like human
athletes
that there's in some papers a
correlation between how many cut and
regain cycles they had and what their
bmi is later in life
um
i think what really tends to happen is
that
uh
the down regulation of energy
expenditure can persist for
an appreciable amount of time
and in many cases won't be fully
reversed until the weight or the fat is
regained and the lean tissue is regained
and it takes a while to regain the lean
tissue
um
there's some really cool evidence
showing that hyperphagia after copper
competition the or after weight loss
that kind of excessive hunger persists
until you've regained all the lean
tissue that was lost
i think in a lot of cases what's
happening is people are
dieting down getting lean
they are gaining
in some cases more body fat than they
lost or they're failing to fully recover
their lean tissue and it's putting them
in a spot where their their energy
expenditure based on their body mass
is still lower than they thought now if
they fully recover their lean tissue in
many cases they do it after overshooting
their body fat and so now when they when
they die it down
certainly it's harder to diet down from
a higher body fat than from a lower body
fat i think that's a big role also
there's some studies showing that
again if you don't really give your body
time to recover from a dieting phase and
re-establish
uh your normal energy expenditure at
your normal body weight
you know
down regulation and energy expenditure
can persist for up to years
if you maintain a reduced body weight so
in many cases i would suggest that
people who don't allow themselves to you
know kind of go back to a normal
settling point and actually maintain it
for a while they're probably already
they probably are beginning their prep
with some degree of metabolic rate
suppression and so i would imagine that
makes it look even more rigorous
uh when it you start
with suppression and then it only gets
worse from there so i don't believe that
there's some kind of metabolic
uh
permanent damage that can't be reversed
i just think that the more you kind of
the more extreme the adaptations are the
more thoughtful and patient you have to
be with actually facilitating recovery
before you begin the next weight loss
phase and if you fail to do that you're
probably going to start your next prep
with either a lower
energy expenditure or a higher body fat
right i've seen this myself quite a bit
in
bikini competitors who try to do
consecutive seasons so that they'll
they'll compete one year get get very
lean and then decide you know six months
later they're going to start a diet for
another show the very next year
and i'll find i would say the majority
of the time that they actually find it
much harder on the second prep than the
first prep and it's really easy i find
to just attribute this to metabolic
damage as well your you know your your
metabolism is still damaged from the
last prep but as you say it could very
well be due to the fact that they lost
muscle while they were dieting down the
first time six months later haven't
fully regained all of that lean mass
back yet might have even overshot their
fat mass so now their starting body
composition is worse the second time
than it was the first time
and that can lead to all kinds of
psychological effects stress you out
more make it more difficult for just the
simple fact that you have more fat to
lose uh and so on and so forth and then
also it could also be that um
in some cases maybe it does take a
little longer than six months for
metabolic rate to to fully come back to
normal um
so i i would say that depending on the
extremity of your diet you you'll want
to
make sure you have plenty of recovery
time before you decide to do the next
one if it's if it's more extreme in
nature
but i would say that mostly applies to
people who are getting really really
lean like quite a bit below what their
set point is i would imagine most people
probably listening to this are
maybe more interested in achieving a
good level of leanness where they might
you know have visible labs but not like
glute striations
um or you know define let's say defined
abs rather than invisible abs
what would be your approach for
maintaining that type of a physique uh
you know after the diet has ended so you
died it down you got your abs what do
you do now
yeah and that's a great point is that
you know
i often write about metabolic adaptation
and i always write from this like it's
hard to get out of your own perspective
and my perspective is probably a lot
like yours which is
i have to get rid of all the fat like if
if it doesn't hurt when i sit down on a
chair because my glutes still have fat
the diet didn't work you know what i
mean
so it's important to remember kind of
remind yourself that not
not everybody's looking for that and
really very few people should be looking
for that you know if you're not a
competitive
bodybuilder then why do you want your
glutes to be you know well-defined it's
it's it's too much
um
but no from that perspective it's always
important to remember that
the stuff we talk about with metabolic
adaptation is far
less in magnitude and the idea of
maintaining that body weight is far more
realistic and actually not a terrible
idea you know no one should be
maintaining five percent body fat
um
but if you want to get down to 9 or 10
and maintain it that's that's totally
fine and actually probably quite quite
doable for a lot of people
the way to do that would be again i
really think you want to deal with some
of these problems on the front end if
the goal is long term
sustaining it long term i would take a
slow rate of weight loss and i would try
to incorporate diet breaks if i could
and that's kind of part of the slow rate
of weight loss right i mean you're
essentially
i don't think you necessarily need to go
two weeks and two weeks like the matador
study but if maybe every fourth week you
go up to maintenance i think that might
be a middle ground that that you could
kind of shoot for
but i would say slow rate of weight loss
to deal with those problems on the front
end
and then once you get to that goal that
goal um
body weight
and you're trying to maintain it i would
say certainly immediately go to
maintenance calories across the board no
need for the non-linearity anymore
because the non-linearity is only
helpful because you must have a deficit
and you're trying to just deal with it
you know but if you're not losing weight
anymore you don't need a deficit and you
should just be in a constant diet break
where you're eating at maintenance but
just just to clarify by non-linearity
you basically mean doing refeeds or diet
breaks so you don't right feeds yeah
yeah yeah the only point of those
refeeds and diet breaks is to give your
body a rest from being in a deficit and
the only reason you're in a deficit is
because you want to continue losing more
weight
so i would say immediately get back to
maintenance if you want to have some
days that are a little above maintenance
just to kind of mix things up that's
where you could maybe do some non-linear
stuff just to
have maybe a low day to accommodate like
a big cookout you're excited to go to
right
but i would say get to maintenance and
this is where i would say you can
probably
start creeping up your caloric intake
just a little bit
keep an eye on your body fat or your
body weight
um
and your body fat you know but keep an
eye on your progress i i think some
people can get away with kind of if
there is any metabolic adaptation or
metabolic suppression present
with a very patient approach you can
probably increase your calories at a
slow enough rate that you are
accommodating that
uh with
you know essentially subconscious
increases in non-exercise activity or
maybe restoration of maybe a small down
regulation of the resting metabolic rate
um
so this kind of leads us into the
concept of reverse dieting right
and the one thing i always
really want to stress to people is that
reverse dieting is not a way to
supercharge your metabolism or give you
anything more than what you were born
with
all we're trying to do there is
basically
coax the body out of that suppressed
state by saying hey we're at maintenance
if not a little bit above you know we
don't have to keep constraining
resting energy expenditure and
constraining
non-exercise activity and i think in
some cases with people that respond
quite well to it you can see that as
they slowly increase their calories they
also are slowly kind of undoing some of
that suppression uh especially if
they're not at a critically lean body
fat level
right um
when it comes to
reverse dieting
let's quickly split this up into two
different groups so you have one group
of people who are dieting to get
shredded for a competition so anyone
men's physique bikini natural
bodybuilders whatever
uh
what's your approach after the the diet
so after the competition has ended for
them do you find reverse dieting
appropriate in that context or what what
do you what do you say for those people
yeah so uh
this is where i would lean more toward
recovery dieting
so it's kind of two sides of the same
coin in my opinion so like jeff
albertson 3d mj as far as i know kind of
coined the term recovery diet because
what they were finding
i'm kind of putting words in their mouth
but it seems like they were finding that
people were obsessed with this very slow
increase in calories after getting
extremely lean
and they were basically not facilitating
their recovery from prep sufficiently so
if you're getting extremely lean
and you're doing anything resembling
like a competition prep you should be
doing something that's more
more resembles a recovery diet i think
there's a lot of factors that go into
how quickly calories should be increased
after a weight loss attempt
a lot of factors um now if you're a
bodybuilder
who got super lean
and you are not going to compete again
for a while
and you are not at your genetic limit
for muscle growth or you know muscle
mass
it's really hard to justify
spending that much time at such a low
body fat with all the hormonal
adaptations that come with it
you need to get into a spot where your
body can actually start making
improvements and putting on lean mass
and recovering from what you just put it
through
that is a very different circumstance
from a person who
has no intention to gain you know
substantial amounts of lean mass beyond
what they have they're at a very
reasonable maintainable body fat and
they don't intend to do any more weight
loss or weight gain cycles in a long
time
that's the case where you could maybe do
a much slower approach
increase calories just a little bit but
you're going to reach a limit like
you're not going to reverse diet until
you're like you know what i'm
i'm still an eight percent body fat but
i eat you know 6 000 calories a day
um i mean maybe if you're training like
an absolute monster maybe
but
in most cases all you're trying to do
there is you get down to the the weight
that you want to maintain at and you
just kind of see what you can get away
with you know some people can probably
coax their their uh caloric intake up
just a little bit and start to undo a
little bit of suppression that's present
and they might say you know what with
this process of trying to kind of
titrate my caloric intake up a little
bit now i can afford a couple hundred
more calories a day which is not
negligible you know
maybe 100 or 200 or something like that
just gives you a little bit more wiggle
room in the diet but you know i i don't
like to set people's expectations to
this idea that they're going to
get down to really low body fat levels
reverse diet gain no fat fully recover
and now they're like five percent body
fat and eating until they feel sick
i i don't see that as as a reality uh
for any significant number of people
yeah there's really no way to shortcut
it i i've found like even if you were to
say reverse your way up to four thousand
calories you'd still feel terrible
because your body fat would be so low
and you'd have to expend so much energy
with cardio which you'd barely be able
to get your way through i mean either
way being at that very depleted state
regardless of food intake is gonna suck
uh it's for most people it's gonna feel
yeah
and well like i mean what we're seeing
is that these effects are because we are
we have low availability of energy
and if you are very very lean and not
gaining fat you still have low energy
availability i don't care how many
calories you're putting in clearly
what's happening is that you're burning
all of them so as you said you're still
miserable and you're still not recovered
right now i want to talk about reverse
dieting in the context of let's say
someone like myself so
at the moment i'm running something of
an extended mini cut
i don't want to commit to calling it a
cut
so it's an extended mini cut but in any
case
once i get to the point where i feel
like my abs are a little bit more
defined i'll probably end the the cut uh
so i i would imagine somewhere in the
you know eight nine ten percent body fat
range is where i want to get to um
now at this point i'm not gonna i don't
feel like i'm really gonna need a
recovery per se so i feel like the
recovery diet wouldn't really be
appropriate in that context but yet it
would be cool to try to maintain this
level of leanness the best i can while
still eating more because even if i say
feel the same and even if it's only just
being burned off through extra
expenditure
200 extra calories 300 400 whatever
however high i can push it is still more
food that i get to eat so it's still
positive and it's still probably going
to fuel my performance a little bit
better so
in that context i feel like a kind of a
slow reverse diet actually is a good
idea um assuming that your goal is to
stay leaner right
i would say that is kind of the
perfect
picture of like
where it makes sense to do a kind of
slower reverse diet is you're not at a
body fat that's absolutely brutal it's
potentially maintainable
and
you know you're comfortable enough that
you don't need to recover from what
you've done
that is where it makes sense to say
again the way i view reverse dieting is
can we just kind of induce a little bit
more
inefficiency with how we're using
calories just to buy us a little bit of
wiggle room in the diet it's not going
to make you feel different
it's not going to
induce any kind of recovery which you
won't need
the only other you know really great
application aside from just trying to
re-establish a settling point or
re-establish kind of a a maintenance
level
the only other time i can really see it
making sense is if you are
a
really high-level bodybuilder or
physique athlete that hasn't you
basically have decided i don't intend to
gain any more lean mass
i compete frequently
and so basically what i'm trying to do
is
because i compete frequently i need to
stay kind of with shot of of my stage
weight
or i'm at a point with my muscle mass
where the only thing i could feasibly do
to perform better as an athlete is to
come in leaner and leaner each time so
if your sole focus then is going to be
on
getting absolutely as lean as a person
can get
and you don't really need to take an off
season of muscle building which few are
in this position but i could at least
theoretically see a case where you say
you know what we will delay recovery a
little bit assuming there's no like
clinically relevant symptoms that we
really are concerned about
and we'll take our time and make sure we
really do this the right way so that
next time we're on stage it'll like
will be so lean it'll change the world
and will forever set the standard for
what a physique looks like
that's a very rare case but i think your
ex your kind of application is perfect
yeah yeah
shout out to the one person listening
who who this yeah
yeah i'm sure you're out there somewhere
well man that has been super informative
it's been a real pleasure to chat i feel
like i'm gonna need to get you on again
and talk about some of your other work
because this is just such a small sliver
of it um what i think i'll do is link
your your research gate profile uh down
below so people can go and have a look
at some of the other stuff you've done
and i know that you're you're working uh
with uh stronger by science now writing
articles over there and curating
research and that kind of thing so i'll
link some of your work there as well and
you wrote a really nice piece uh
summarizing a bunch of this stuff uh for
the mass research review um only
subscribers will be able to get it but
i'll i'll put the link for that down
down there as well uh people would like
to check it out but eric thanks so much
for your time man
yeah thanks for having me um yeah anyone
that wants to get in touch um i'm trying
to be better about being on social media
since i'm not living in the lab anymore
so uh you know reach out to me on
facebook and instagram and twitter and
all that stuff and i should have a very
very very long thorough article about
metabolic adaptation
refeeds and reverse dieting um it's done
i just don't know when it's gonna
officially come out but um keep an eye
on stronger by science.com
and uh it's it's basically
like
i think close to 20 000 words of
everything i've ever thought about
basically everything we just discussed
amazing um well if you can get it out
before saturday i'll link it otherwise
uh great i'll do it later but anyway man
it's been a pleasure i'd love to get you
back on and chat about some some
supplement stuff so and anyone who's
listening um you can stay tuned for that
eric's tremendously knowledgeable about
supplements so uh something we can talk
about anyway man uh thanks for coming on
uh make sure you guys show eric some
support go over check out his social
media platforms and send him a message
let me know you enjoyed this show leave
