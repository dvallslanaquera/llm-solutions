hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and i have something very
special to offer you
super foods
their foods oh but wait there's more
they're super
or maybe that's all bs let's take a look
at what the science
has to say
that term has been muddled by politics
recently okay what is a super food okay
because
tons and tons of claims you go on the
websites here's a funny story my dad
watches these youtube videos hi dad
and uh a lot of times
uh he'll click on the ads
which is nice as it fractionally makes
us a little bit more money feel free to
click on some ads yourself why not
lamborghinis don't pay for themselves
and
sometimes he gets ads from people like
dr gundry or whatever some stupid
motherfucker who can't tell his own
front of his hand from the back of his
hand yes i hope you hear this sir
well challenge you to fisty cuffs just
joking stay calm and these guys these
charlatan doctors are all about super
foods and good and bad foods they're
like one of the fucking doctor gundry
guys like tomatoes don't eat them
they've got lycopene or something like
that tomatoes are gone they're bad
imagine say seeing someone in italy who
lives like 98 eating tomatoes and you're
like idiots committing suicide in any
case
these like dr oz doctor this doctor that
they all love super foods blueberries
and peaches and the one food you don't
know about acai berries i do jiu jitsu i
know all about acai so
the problem with superfoods is first of
all they don't have a definition because
they're not a scientifically cogent
concept
do superfoods have lots of nutrients
do they have healing properties
do they have a lot of nutrients per
calorie because like a pizza actually
has a shitload of nutrients but like for
how many calories it gives you
you know an apple has more nutrient per
calorie i don't know nobody knows
because there's no definition it's just
a bs marketing term made up and used by
charlatan doctors some of them actually
quite reputable medical doctors in their
past lives and i guess at some point the
switch just flips and you're tired of
doing cardiac surgery and you're like
fuck this i could just make fake
supplements and make 10 times the money
yahoo what i'm saying kind of feeling
like if this whole evidence-based shit
doesn't work out i'll just sell the fuck
out
guys if i'm gonna sell out please in the
comments below tell me how to do it what
am i selling here
fusion powered dildos
fusion powered sex machines
fusion powered pocket
vaginas mean the list really goes on i
have all sorts of ideas all of them
fusion powered and sexually related in
any case it's just not a scientific
concept so when people are like hey what
do you think about superfoods there's
nothing to think about it's like saying
what do you think about ghosts be like
you know what i'm saying when i see one
i'll let you know
or will i because the ghosts are
ready to even do that if they can't
interact with if they float through
walls how can they
contact you is it that because you have
a soul
who knows oh do they they turn on and
off their shit their pass through who
the fuck knows as much evidence for goes
to superfoods i'll tell you that much
here's the deal there's a little bit of
validity here just a tiny little silver
lining of literally
occurs in all bullshit concepts at the
end of the day
you can't just sell bullshit you gotta
code it
in a silver lining of truth and then
people swallow it and then it bursts
open in their intestines and they're on
the plane thinking oh shit this is how
i'm gonna die oh wait that's just me
smuggling coke from venezuela anyway
some foods truth
are healthier than others on average on
average and in context
so veggies fruits whole grains lean
means healthy fats shit like olive oil
on average is healthier for you
then if you eat that predominantly then
if you eat junk food predominantly oh
what dr mike jung food doesn't have a
definition sure is fucked up highly
palatable food that is often high in
sugar high in saturated fat low in
vitamins minerals phytochemicals and
fiber so like most of the things you get
at mcdonald's or a bag of chips
or i was going to say a plate of ice
cream
fuck that would work you'd have to eat
it very fast otherwise
it melts
so absolutely some foods are healthier
than others
but
a couple things first
even junk food is okay if the
preponderance of your intake maybe 75 or
so comes from healthy foods so like if
you eat mostly really good diet like for
lunch you have like salmon and fucking
brown rice and broccoli for breakfast
you had kind of a similar meal and for
dinner you have a great meal and then
like you're watching tv and you have
like half a pint of ben and jerry's but
you train hard enough to burn it off
earlier that day like
i don't fucking you're not gonna die
you're totally fine like it's just not a
thing that food is just some kind of any
amount of junk food kills you that's bs
and certainly no amount of apples and
oranges can counterbalance in some way
some negativity you added with other
food
if you meet your macros and calories and
eat mostly healthy sources you're
totally good there's no more super to
add to that
at the end of the day superfoods are
a subcategoried in a bigger list of what
i like to call one-shot fixes or like
this turn-key fallacy and fitness many
other pursuits where this one solution
just fractally overtakes everything and
makes it all better there is no anything
like that short of something like
advanced science has to take a long time
and make like the drug semaglotide is
almost a turnkey for hunger management
it has its own downsides of course but
like that shit took scientists years in
a lab to engineer and make better and
better for multiple generations you know
i'm saying it does not just hang it off
the fucking tree in the amazon and if
you really think that those are
superfoods go ahead and eat that shit
and see if you don't just die the next
day or shortly thereafter in any case
superfoods are bullshit i won't even do
the arnold voice this time bullshit i
had to
i want i'm pro super foods i want there
to be super foods
i want
a world
in which grandma's real sick
she's in the hospital
and you're about to go visit her but
they make the first super food ever and
they feed it to grandma let's say it's a
jello or the hospital they like the
jello and grandma cuts into it and she's
like oh
that's quite good she's shaking very
weak
and and after she finishes the last
bite of jello
real superfoods this is what i'm
advocating you come in and you're like
grandma
i'm so sorry and you kind of want to
talk to her maybe one last time but you
walk in and she's floating
three inches above her bed electric arc
circling her body and she's like
nobody can tell me anything anymore i am
power
and you're like god damn is there any
jello left over i'll see you guys next
time
you
