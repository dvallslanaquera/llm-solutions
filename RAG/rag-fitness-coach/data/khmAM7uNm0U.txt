only a few years ago there was this idea
they could only grow muscle during sets
of 8 to 12 reps for hypertrophy rep
range lots of studies have now suggested
that this is false you can optimize
muscle growth doing sets of anywhere
around 5 to 40 repetitions provided you
get close to muscular failure in fact
using a variety of rep ranges might even
enhance muscle growth overall by
stimulating hypertrophy via different
mechanisms
