hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and I want to ask you a
question are sarms the real deal do they
work what do they do Scott the video guy
is laughing right now
because this is a video we just kind of
had to put out because lots of you find
folks in the comments are asking Dr Mike
what about sarms well here you go not
that long of a video but there's not a
lot to say
sarms
you'll hear about them in the comments
section of every YouTube video even
things unlike how to grow plants there's
always one bro in there that responding
to no one will be like I don't fuck
takes steroids man I do sarms hey what
about sarms what do you think about
sarms sarms creatine and sarms hey what
about SARS for my girl bro
well bro here's what about sarms
selective engine receptor modulators
are drugs intended to generate uh
anabolic effect muscle growth effect
similar to that of anabolic steroids
but with very very truncated very
minimal side effects
sounds pretty cool
here's the reality as of the Year 2023
early 2023 maybe some cool shit will
come down the pipe first many
unfortunately actually have comparable
effects to anabolic steroids sorry side
effects comparable side effects to
anabox damage which kind of blows we
thought they were going to be side
effect free they were not
secondly some are pretty legit and like
they have liver toxicity effects and all
that stuff so they're not risk-free a
lot of people takes arms thinking like
fuck it I'm just on sarms whatever it
doesn't matter
and sometimes it doesn't work out that
way
huge swaths per actual peer-reviewed
literature of Psalms on the market are
still faked fake fucking sarms which
come in one of two varieties generally
one nothing no active ingredients two
or all steroids
usually Dianabol D ball Winstrol almost
never osarms actually VAR because VAR is
more expensive and if they're gonna fuck
you in the ass they might as well do it
for cheap
so a lot of people are like hey mom's
arms my nipples are small enough sex
drives like crazy I gain 10 pounds of
bloat my lifts have all gone up by 50. I
love sarms and every lifter has ever
used gear I was like yes yes sarms
that's what you're on
now lastly
some are absolutely effective and
relatively safe
but which ones and which brand version
is still up in the air there's not a
consensus yet that I'm aware of about
which brands and which sarms really are
like the go-to low side effect high
yield
reasonably Dependable that you're
getting what you're getting in the
fucking can type of shit now if you guys
know of any brands or any drug names or
anything like that that you've heard or
can cite a reference to that's like this
is well vetted this is the real deal etc
et cetera by all means share them in the
comments and then the rest of you who
are skeptical look that shit up and see
if it's if it's vetted out because some
people like yeah man fucking dildo Labs
puts out a great sound product I use you
Google dildo Labs just one insane guy in
a fucking dumpster that makes his own
gear and you're like yes science
so do as you wish
but in 2023 at least early 2023 sarms
are not yet the Golden Fleece of
anabolics
maybe they will be soon maybe other
drugs will come in and be even better I
can't wait for anabolic drugs that grow
muscle that don't have a fraction of the
side effects of steroids because steroid
side effects are awful
I think it'll be a great thing I just
don't think Psalms are dependably in any
Grand sense there yet
so that's what I think about sarms feel
free to ask any follow-up questions you
like I'll get in the comments I'll
answer a few and um if you need feet
