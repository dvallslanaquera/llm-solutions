foreign
that was just a cough
oh my God my legs dude that was good
[Music]
what up RP YouTube I am here with brie
who is two things one a current champion
of NPC show who will be getting a pro
card soon and two still my training
partner you guys recently saw a video of
me and her training together
unfortunately my late training is over
with for my prep I have a show in about
a week and a half so she has to train
legs alone today but for me and Dr Mike
are here for moral supports to cheer her
on and put her through hell because she
has about how many more weeks of heart
training before
and it's what show is it USA's yeah USA
so three weeks until USA just means she
has about four or five hard Lake
sessions left one of which you'll be
doing here with us okay
I'm excited Mike
folks there's a mentality that
bodybuilders close to contests have to
put on and embody and that mentality you
may think is a lion oh wolf no tiger no
bear get out of here miniature dogs why
because the miniature dachshund is not
very big it doesn't have a lot to go
with so it has to compensate with anger
anger that as it's pushed further gets
more intense every try to come up closer
to me laughs
that's how we're doing shit today kick
it
so Bree is my training partner meaning I
do her training for her
um we oftentimes train the same things
and like I said we talked about this in
the other video we did together
sometimes at the ad in volume for her or
she will add in other muscle groups to
the day she does a five-day split and I
do a six day but we always train
together so today what she's doing is a
lying hamstring curl it's her lighter
hamstring day so we're actually doing an
intensity technique on this one where
we're mild rep matching she'll have
three or four sets I'll have to look at
her program
um three or four sets first set she's
going to get the tone and then the next
two sets she'll rep match probably gonna
suck but she's here she's ready for it
yes
good
now you my rep 15. spicy a couple sets
Okay that's doable yeah I think yeah
yeah it doesn't look good I like this
machine
yeah it's uh it's very very smooth light
but it's smooth as fun it's very smooth

culture at one point cardi B claimed
that she neither Cooks nor cleans

does not cook no it does not clean but
it does destroy quadriceps everywhere it
goes and it decided to wander into

oh my God my fucking legs dude that was

you pushed Shard on this this looks like

look what vaping did to this

now I should not be sweating this much
a minute ago Brie was hanging out with
her friends at the movie theater hitting
this fate and now look what happened
folks you listen to me when I say this
Nicotine kills
hey girl you trying to hit that shit
I'm better now
foreign
dude I've been doing 25s on that fucking
machine yeah I know
don't look at me I don't know what's
going on
I know how to work with prisoners you
never hear their complaints for help
I'ma Drake that shit
I can't help you
as I mentioned earlier oftentimes we
will throw extra volume in for Bree uh I
don't need more glute volume Bree does
to an extent so on both of her leg
sessions we add in either a lunge or
thrust variation
we did have lunches today but she had a
little uh issue in the back portion of
her hamstring where her glute is
she's weak
so we are going to do a Thrust today
probably barbell since we don't really
have too many variations of that here
she uses a machine and dragon layer that
is comparable to this so she'll be
elevated shoulders up on there and I got
a little pad for her
her nice and frail waist because you're
so lean
but it's going to be a giant set 50 reps
total we might take some weight off
we'll see this should be fine
two
let's get ten three
[Music]
four
five way to hold that Peak six
seven
[Music]
eight
nine
ten
good shit
stop
I made an audible because the machine is
a little different we're doing actual
hip thrusts but we're just going to do a
superset the lunges she decided felt
pretty good so we're going to do
bodyweight lunges after we do about 10
to 15 on the hip thrust she's gonna do
two sets here that'll make up for the
volume that we were going to do on the
machine hip thrust I would do a dragon
layer but uh she's enjoying it so far so
let's see how this next set goes
don't cave over too much stay upright
yeah there you go
[Music]
turn all the way back
slower on the way down
yeah there you go there you go
long steps go go
yep and all the way back and you're done
quick what the fuck quick come on come
