one push-up and then back to the knees
slow
[Music]
up
good glad i said one
let's do three total
[Music]
yo youtube what's up i'm dr mike this is
chad caudill
oh i got it right got it ifbb pro men's
physique
and
the judge just told him he listen you
got really good shape you got everything
going for you but you need a bigger
chest
guess what we're training today back
just kidding it's chest
you're good to go you're ready to go
yeah let's rock it oh yeah let's do it
exercise number one is the cambered bar
bench press very unique setup most gyms
don't have a camera bar if you're
personally familiar with the owner of
your gym i'm gonna go to the gym the
next day even today and just start
bothering the fuck out of them to get
your camera bar it's incredible it works
great for squats it works great for rows
it works great for especially chest for
bench pressing because there's a good
decent amount of literature now to show
that a deep stretch under heavy load
provides a crapload of hypertrophy in
the chest as a muscle the way it's
inserted
it's exposed to deep stretch incredibly
well and this movement is fucking brutal
big thing is though at a super deep
stretch like that if you
use anything less than your 5rm or you
bounce out of it the chance of pectoral
rupture is low but much higher than you
want it to be so what i would say is
always pause for a big big second at the
bottom and at least do sets of five reps
probably more like sets of ten to
fifteen that's what we're gonna do today
multiple sets we'll see how chad likes
it
up
three perfect self-paced no more
commands
take your time down there
four
chest
five
smooth
smooth
six
big chest
yes
seven keep going let's get ten
eight big chest big chest yeah there you
go
nine chest up chest up chest up
good
one more
chest
press go go go go go go crap
for the most rhetorical question ever do
you feel that in your chest yeah
good stuff that feels amazing take a
nice break and we'll do it
i need a bar like that
six control on the way down
chest up
up
seven more you got this
stop
oh yeah rack
that's one wrapping reserve if i've ever
seen it
good stuff getting a little pump getting
a little pumped man i feel like i'm
already fully pumped yeah excellent all
right all right so a huge huge tip for
chest training
is what i call exposing your chest to
the tension we know that tension under
stretch grows a muscle
so
when you're pressing any kind of press
machine press dumbbell press
especially barbell pressing
there is a way to press where you press
with your shoulders forward and your
chest caved in and you're kind of just
actually preventing your chest from
getting stretched you're saving your
chest more for tries a lot more work for
front delts that's not exactly why
you're doing these movements so a big
deal is to borrow a technique from the
power lifters take your shoulder blades
and move them back retract your scapulae
and then arch your back a little bit to
lift your chest up and then as you move
the bar down or the machine down or the
dumbbells down reach up with the chest
to open it into the movement it will not
feel good in the sense that you will
feel weaker more exposed your fibers
will start to pull apart it'll hurt more
in the good way
but that
stretch that pain that exposure shifts
the load incredibly to the chest at its
really length and position
you will get the biggest pump of your
life
and then you're gonna go home and you're
gonna say hey grandma guess what
happened to me today and she was like
what you learned how to archer retract
or expose your chest to low and you're
like what the fuck how did you know that
and she's like i i don't know ever
everything
thing she's ai four two more
up
one more you got this chad big chest
press
flawless
amazing
so it really is just genetics on my
chest not growing
genetics is a huge thing
next up incline dumbbell press
gonna be lots of technique tips here
so
probably four sets of
10 to 20 reps more like 10 to 15.
and one thing i want you guys to pay
attention to is that when you have the
technique set right and chad is
six to 250 pounds pro bodybuilder
he's going to be using weights that are
not the 150s they're not the 180s like a
lot of guys like to sling around
with good technique you don't have to
use a lot of weight to get a good
stimulus and that's really the key let's
get it done
seven
hey these are phenomenal way to go deep
oh shit nine one more
slow control
smooth
lock it
wrap
oh
that cambered bar bench takes it out of
you yeah it's like doing these with no
chest left over
good stuff feeling pretty good on the
chest with those excellent that's how
fire it is shoulder stealing okay and
everything
four
control
five two more slow
up
six one more chad let's do it
slow slow slow big chest
up
in push them in yes
good stuff good stuff
let's uh
i'm gonna reduce the weight for the next
two sets okay so we can get some more
repetitions 55s
this will be set number seven
for chad's
workout 250 pounds
pro bodybuilder fucking enormous 55
pounds
on the incline dumbbell press
yes chest is a weakness but i don't know
i like this motherfucker that's a big
ass chest compared to damn near everyone
certainly everyone walking around
if you use proper technique
if you take your sets close to failure
later in the workout it is absolutely
not shameful at all
to use lighter weights because as
someone who is interested in hypertrophy
in looking the part
everything here in the gym is just a
tool to get jacked and if the proper
tool for the proper rep range happens to
be a dumbbell that many would consider
like oh we are 55 i thought you'd do
more
that's okay that's okay because we're
here to grow and that's it if you want
to impress people
get into the rack
set up just above knee height
put 18 plates on each side
barely pick it up scream a lot
and then that one girl you're always
looking at she's going to come up to you
and she's going to be like look i don't
really say this ever to people at the
gym but
we should go to your place to have sex
because i want to have sex with you
right here right now but i understand
that socially this is not acceptable and
you'll be in the car probably a cargo
van that's what you drive and then
you'll be on on your way to your house
to to get
fucking laid you're the man
ready
six
deep stretch yes
seven more
more
chest up quality only
[Music]
and ride it down as if you're going to
do another chest up chest up hold for a
second hold
rack
[Applause]
excellent
that's the thumbnail
there you go all the way to the left
thank you so much chad
[Music]
[Music]
good again slow
[Music]
one more i'm right here with you
slow slow slow
up up
up
i got it
go forward right away
push-up position
look forward into the mirror
right there close grip look forward

up
full lockout and then down
up
and to your knees
and again three more
one slow
up
two take your time
last one
slow
big push
go go go
that's it good job tell me you feel that
in your triceps you didn't tell me about
that one yeah sorry it's a little
surprise
all the sets will be like that
super dirty i
honestly like
that i knew i had to say something
before you started and i was like as
soon as you start i was like ah i was
like should we just have them do
straight sets i'm like you didn't drive
all this way to do straight sets so
third exercise triceps we are doing
skull crushers with a super awesome
little weird cambered bar you can go
super deep and superset two push-ups a
lot of times there's a kind of a problem
where if your triceps are super tired
and you go into push-ups because your
chest can take over can actually drive
most of the pushing and it ends up being
more chest work and maybe not as good of
tricep work however if your triceps are
really super pre-exhausted and you take
a close grip and your elbows are in
there's just no way to get around a
brutal fucking tricep stimulus
especially if you focus on them and go
slow on the way down it will destroy you
try this shit at home make sure
grandma's around to spot you otherwise
you could end up on the ground with your
face in the ground then grandma comes in
and she's like what are you doing junior
and i'm like i don't know grandma i
haven't thought this joke through so
here that's it
let's get four total here even if you
