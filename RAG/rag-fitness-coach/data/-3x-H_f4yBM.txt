hey folks dr mike ezratal here for
renaissance periodization
nucleus overload training you've been
asking about it
and i'm answering we're going to take a
critical look
upsides downsides so on and so forth now
before we start
different folks have different ideas
slightly of what this means
we're sort of shooting for the average
so i'm really sorry if i mischaracterize
it i promise it wasn't on purpose
i did some interneting to try to find
out what it is that it really was
i found out some stuff hopefully i'm not
too far off the mark so today we're
going to talk about what nucleus
overload training
is what are the potential benefits to it
what are some unanswered questions about
it
and what are the potential uh upsides or
sorry potential downsides or those
benefits
unanswered questions downsides and then
lastly should you try it because you're
probably thinking
should i try let's get started so first
of all what is
nucleus overload training it's
essentially
and there's a lot of ways to skin the
cat the cat hates all those ways by the
way it's miserable
um it's training with a lot of volume
and intensity
what you can term an unsustainable
amount of volume and intensity
in the long term okay and this is
usually done for a period of several
weeks
to a month and potentially more will be
charitable and say two to four weeks
but some of the programs call for six
weeks plus
that's a whole level of insanity that's
a bit different but it's really just a
ton
of psychotic training which may be a
good thing maybe that
right the idea here the hypothesis
is based on myonuclear domain sealing
which is pretty well vetted and here's
what it is the amount of muscle
uh or sorry the amount of muscle volume
a single cell nucleus
in a muscle cell can control is limited
the easiest and actually
almost homologous analogy here is
one city government can only control a
city that's
so big right if you have like one city
government one municipal building one
courthouse one place where the ambulance
is parked one fire department
how much area can it actually help like
if there's a fire
half a mile away one fire department you
know
little town with a fire department can
handle it no problem if that town grows
in size
without adding any more control centers
like municipal building
fire departments so on and so forth
water treatment plant
if that stuff grows out to matrix style
pre-robot battle cities of a hundred
miles you're looking
one fire department and you've got a
fire 90 miles away
let that motherfucker burn because we're
not getting there on time to do shit
right at some point
a city can get so big that it needs
multiple control centers multiple
regions to do stuff think about new york
city
yeah manhattan has its own shit
brooklyn's technically a part of new
york
but brooklyn has its own fire department
with its own multiple stations and so on
and so forth
things have to sort of fractal out
because central control centers
only have so much reach just the same
way
literally almost exactly the same way a
cell nucleus which is the control center
of the cell to some extent
can control and sort of manage and
keep well functioning only a certain
volume spherical volume around him
when a muscle grows bigger than that it
decays
in function quite rapidly great thing
evolution thought of that shit already
so at some point when your muscle cells
get to a certain size
growth stops it doesn't really stop but
growth no longer happens
by just the addition of a cell volume
outside of one nucleus what happens is
there's satellite cells all around a
typical muscle cell and usually they're
like
the full-size nucleus but not a lot of
stuff around it and it's kind of dormant
it doesn't do a whole lot
when this myonuclear domain this total
volume that one nucleus can control gets
big enough
some signaling occurs and it's like hey
wake up we need help
so essentially another fire department
opens up
20 miles away and voila you get the same
level of coverage
this nucleus essentially floats into the
cell and now instead of having one
nucleus here
with a bunch of stuff around it that it
can control this new nucleus myonuclear
addition
occurs satellite cell maturation occurs
now you have two nuclei
and they can control well double the
area or something or a lot more area
so muscle cells grow essentially in two
ways and muscles grow in two ways
they go grow through expansion of just
regular myonuclear domain
when the myonuclear domain hits its
ceiling of like what this is just too
much to control
the satellite cells proliferate in and
help the whole thing to get bigger by
addition of myonuclei okay
once added the myonuclei because like
if you started with the total volume you
can't grow beyond
with one nucleus when you have two
nuclei you can grow more volume now
so now your body will grow more muscle
as long as nuclei keep being added
nucleus overload training hypothetically
allegedly boosts growth
by taking the satellite cell
incorporation process
and making it go faster so maybe you
grow a certain amount and then the
myonuclear domain comes and the growth
really slows and then nucleus is like
hey
hurry up and help me out in the other
nuclear like oh what's going on
i guess we'll get in there our own do
fucking time brush their teeth
and floss and put on three outfits take
one off so on and so forth
man the uh nucleus overload training
claims
or hypothesizes that it can get those
myonuclei to help out
faster that as soon as the growth starts
to slow
per one unit nuclear volume then
the satellite if you do this kind of
training the idea is
boom the satellite cells incorporate
more rapidly and then voila
you get this part and then boom boom
boom and all of a sudden you're getting
much more jacked
much more quickly allegedly okay
so what are the potential benefits of it
assuming we sort of know what we know
with sports science so far
so assuming there's no crazy magic that
happens
what are the potential benefits of it
cutting it no extra slack whatsoever
well first of all is functional
overreaching pretty well documented
process
when you go beyond the muscle's normal
ability to recover in a brief time
you can get really really impressive
gains if you pull back right after
a super compensation model of
hypertrophy really push the pace
then really pull back and you get a
large measure of muscle hypertrophy
confirmed in laboratory with multiple
studies
the thing is this process in a real
world probably only works well
if you exceed your maximum recoverable
volume which is the whole
point of this um for like one or two
weeks in two weeks geez
that's a lot if you folks watching have
ever been
in excess of your mrv truly training
hard
um two weeks in excess of mrv is like
hell
okay you don't even know what's up and
what's down anymore and it's dangerous
because you can get
into what's called non-functional
overreaching when you bounce back
but the bounce back just corrects the
muscle you lost bouncing up
you don't want to be in that part so
three weeks
that's psychotic that's probably going
to be non-functional right
one week of overreaching may be a good
idea so potentially
by doing nucleus overload training or
something like it for one or two weeks
you can get this big rebound effect and
gain muscle on the net balance
so nucleus overload training which from
now what i'm going to call
not right not
is very likely to lead to overreaching
because it's just a ton of training
all the same time so it might help boost
muscle growth in this context
especially if you're in a situation
where you thought your mrv was this but
it's really that
if you've been underdoing your volume
for a while
for a variety of reasons maybe you
started out with low volume maybe you
trained with a training partner that
just had a lower mrv than you
and it turns out your mrv is actually
here nucleus overload training either
goes here or even here
and all of a sudden you're doing a ton
more volume like oh my god nucleus
overload training is gonna be fucking
jacked this is unbelievable it's magic
it's the nuclei the satellite cells
i'm a fucking science project this is
sweet well maybe what's going on is
you've just been under doing it a ton
and the people that tend to benefit the
most
if you read the forums which i do all
the time
i have no friends if you look a lot of
the people that are benefiting
from nucleus overall training are ones
that weren't really pushing the pace
with volume to begin with and they're
actually under doing it by longshot so
here
big potential benefits right now what
are the unanswered questions here
because i said earlier if we don't
assume any magic well here's the magic
the mechanisms of nuclear edition are
just not well established
we don't have a good replicated reliable
time course
for when do we reach a myonuclear domain
how long after reaching bionuclear
domain ceiling or sorry the ceiling
how long after reaching the ceiling does
it take for satellite cells to be
incorporated
um how hard do you have to train if you
just train normally do the satellite
cells normally incorporate every time a
myonuclear domain ceiling is hit or
a satellite still incorporation
especially profound
when you go really above your ability to
recover is it like an emergency valve
that only really turns on when you go
psychotic
or is it one of those situations where
if you just train normally
which means occasionally really hard it
happens anyway we just don't know
right so if you're going super hard for
weeks and weeks and weeks
weeks you're kind of risking you know
we'll talk about
what risks you're taking in a little bit
um
to bet on an unknown right because if
you tell someone in the gym someone's
like dude
this is your third week of like doing
insane volume you're like
yeah like what's the upside here like
what's this for
like well you see satellite cells and
fucking myonuclei and someone what's
that like i don't really know
like you got any studies about that like
no they actually don't have any studies
about that
like okay so why are you doing this
again you're like i i'm not really sure
okay maybe it's worth a try but it's not
confirmed enough so
some people are selling these methods
and hey listen more power to them
be a little skeptical about like hey is
there a ton of science backing it i'll
save you experience the answer is no
and that might they might still be
correct because science can catch up
but it's not this obvious thing like oh
yeah we know for sure that if you train
like a cycle for four weeks and then
take a de-load
you grow tons of muscle because this
exact myonuclear pathway occurs
bullshit because we just don't know that
at all right
and here's the real kicker you get a lot
of growth out of training hard
you're like fucking nuclei it's the
nuclei right you have no idea
if when you get impressive growth
results if it's mostly from
the expansion of just the normal you
have a normal nucleus and you're way off
your myonuclear domain
and if it's just the normal expansion or
if it's capped the normal expansion it's
the addition of satellite cells that
gives you that extra growth
there's no way to tell with our current
technology unless they piece you apart
and
well they don't put you back together
after that unless you're getting muscle
biopsies
you have no idea what the mechanism of
that growth is when they say what's
nuclear overload training
here's this crazy program the crazy
program can work but then you're not
actually sure
that it's the more rapid incorporation
of new nuclei
that's actually doing the work you have
no idea and then it's like yeah maybe
this program is good because it's high
volume and
you know high frequency or whatever and
that's good for its own sake but it
might just be like through conventional
pathways that you still get better right
maybe and here's the thing if you're a
beginner
you have probably filled so little of
your myonuclear domain
most of the beginner gains you get
remember noob games are these are the
most impressive games you'll ever get
most of those are within domain right
you're not adding a ton of satellite
cells
in many cases as a beginner or as many
as you would be potentially later
because you don't need them your muscles
are small and they have plenty of room
to grow
as an intermediate and advanced it's
almost always
going to be a combination of the two
because as soon as you add in a
satellite cell
nucleus it's got its own domain that is
now expandable
but it's absolutely possible that while
this satellite cell's
domain new domain expands to its limits
another satellite cell is incorporated
here on this side and it starts its
expansion and this expansion has already
stopped
it's all happening at the same time and
this is why
when you grow muscle your muscles kind
of just steadily grow
and grow and grow it's not like nothing
happens nothing happens nothing happens
satellite cells come in and then three
weeks
later you're like ah like that's not how
growth works
it's a more smooth and gradual process
because probably most things are
happening at the same time
which is to say and i don't want to be
talking mad shit here though i'm
getting started nuclear overload
training
nucleus overload training and ot his big
claim is like
this is how the growth is happening it's
through this nuclear pathway of addition
it's charitably we don't know not
charitably it's definitely a combination
of that and regular growth but that
doesn't sell it doesn't sound as sexy
so it doesn't make the headlines right
now
what are the potential downsides this
potential benefit is like functional of
reaching you get some
fucking mad gains there's definitely
some unknowns potential downsides
here we go non-functional overreaching
which is when you do all this crazy
psychotic work and then you get worse
and then the rebound you just get back
to where you were is very possible
it is especially possible with two or
more weeks of going beyond mrv
beyond your maximum recoverable volume
if training feels like it's
unsustainable and you're getting weaker
that's a bad thing if you get weaker for
two or three weeks straight
you're probably just losing muscle
that's really bad and there's no upside
to that
right again that's not the only problem
so that's a big problem by itself
problem number two
is rushing into super high volumes risks
injury quite a bit
nothing crazy but it's certainly you're
only advice for again something that may
not be clearly beneficial
and you're rolling them pretty hard so
here's what i mean if you're normally
used to doing let's say 10 sets per
muscle group per
session or let's say 10 cents per week
this is your normal volume
your systems and tissues are used to
that sort of thing connective tissues
especially
if you find a nucleus overload training
program online
and then the next day or the next week
you go to 30
right around here you may be getting
hurt
because your connective tissues are like
holy fucking shit they're getting hit in
the face all
left and right and center it's just too
much to recover from
if you want to ramp your volume the best
way to do it
is to start from 10 and then try 11 see
how it feels
and then try 12 and see how it feels and
then 13 see how it feels and then deload
and then try 11 again and then 12 and
then 13 and the 14 and then deal just
like that
and then slowly over many many months
and years you find where your best
volumes are your best volume ranges
for growth that if you're used to 10 you
go to 30
that's just bad news again you might
slide by
you probably will with no injury and
you're like hey it fucking worked or
you slide by with no injury but you're
still into number one so you lose muscle
and then it sucks right that may very
well happen but it's a big risk to take
it's a notable risk and i want you guys
to be aware of that
lastly getting to a high volume is
already injurious
or probabilistically more injurious
staying at a really high volume
is an additive independent factor for
injury so like
if you're two weeks into this nuclear
overload training and you're like hey i
didn't get hurt
continuing for three or four weeks is
like
continuing to be in a super high degree
of danger
right it's like one of those uh it's one
of my favorite um
little like things from the movies that
are fucking insane
is when like a guy's like in a submarine
or in a submersible suit
and he's like going down to fix the oil
rig and like he's going way too low but
he has to to save whatever fucking oil
workers
and it gets down to like 50 meters below
like whatever depth it says on the side
of your helmet not to go below
and the suit's like and he's like oh
shit they're fucking
the needles past the red and then he's
still at the same depth like 50 meters
below where he's supposed to be and then
he's like
all right all right nothing's happening
we're good
right and then he just works there for
two hours but the fuck every minute you
spend
is another minute for the shit to just
go bam right
like if you're in a building god forbid
and it partially collapses
and you're like oh my god fuck fucking
these people are falling out of windows
and
shit's collapsing and then you catch
like on some kind of like you know
still like partially erect wall you're
like okay
okay we're good everyone go back to work
like no that's fucking crazy
you don't go back to work you calmly try
to get the fuck out as soon as possible
so in this scenario when you go to 30
sets or whatever crazy shit you're doing
with nuclear overload chain
if you don't get hurt in the first one
or two weeks okay you dodged that bullet
but then there's a guy with a machine
gun a volume shooting your ass for the
entire time that you're up there
you're just rolling the dice casino
style to try to get hurt
not a good idea certainly an idea that
requires stepping back and wondering if
it's worth it and to that end lastly
number five should you try it should you
try nuclear overload training well
nuclear edition probably happens in
normal training we have no good reason
to believe
that normal training doesn't add um uh
nuclei
okay and and we have a bonus point
training as we at rp recommend starting
at relatively low volumes and slowly and
smoothing
coming up to very high and sustainable
ones touching them briefly and then
coming down
that super high exposure a week or so at
mrv
probably if there is something to that
really hard training stimulates
nuclear overload that covers that base
anyway yeah i understand if you always
do 12 sets
you never do 14 or 16 you may be missing
out on some shit but if you start with
around 10 you go to 16 or 18
man 16 18 is probably going to fry you
up enough to do whatever it is nuclear
oral
training claims to do anyway and
in normal training because you only up
an mrv for like a week or so you don't
risk non-functional overreaching right
that's a big deal it's awesome to go
hard and to go for
as long as you can survive but beyond
that point it's fucking stupid
it gets you hurt and worst of all it
costs you muscle
can you imagine having the hardest week
of training of your life week three of
overreaching
and then in retrospect you're like yep i
lost muscle that week
i mean it's one thing to train easy and
not gain muscle
you know nothing wager nothing lost or
minimum
wagered nothing gained uh if you train
as hard as fucking human impossible all
that blood sweat and tears
to lose muscle move the fuck are you
doing in the gym that's literally
backwards right
if you do psychotic programs which cram
your volume like crazy and then extend
it out for forever or for a long time
weeks and weeks and weeks
you're just risking for like a pretty
significant risk of muscle loss injury
so on and so forth so
that's not to say you can't try it i'm
not contradicting myself i fucking
promise
here's the deal you can try nuclear
overload training you can even try it
if you see a program online you're like
oh i'm going to try that you can but
here are a couple recommendations of how
to do it responsibly
for your best interests at heart here's
the deal
ramp up to it if someone says hey listen
here's the program
30 sets is what you want to be if you're
at 10
dude try 12. try 14 okay a week later
two weeks later try
16. two weeks later try 18. and at 18
you might be like the guy in
the fucking dive suit where you're like
crinkling in on yourself and like fuck
that
30 i can't even see that deep fuck that
right
and and then you pull back to eight or
to six
relax recover grow and you're like oh my
god that really works and you realize
you're overreaching only needed to go to
18 sets and 30 was just some
wild dream that was going to be a
disaster or you keep wrapping keep
wrapping keep ramping and you get
incredible results of course deal it
every now and again
but like you get up to 30 eventually
months later
and you have the best gains of your life
hey success and another option is you
get up to 18 or 20 and you just get
really tired really fucked up nothing
happens
you pull back and dealer you just get
back the gains you lost you're like well
look if 18 to 20
was too much what the fuck would i be
doing 34 that's nuts
right so at least ramp up into it
because there's
no rush and the ramping in addition to
finding out if it's even a good idea
takes that risk of that excessive first
boost
and reduces it substantially which is a
really good thing
next risk is the one where we stay too
high for too long so here's this one
don't go longer than two weeks with
ultra high volumes way beyond your
maximum recoverable volume
if you're super fucking fucking beat up
just
out of this world like barely eyes open
coming into the gym to do something
don't do that don't push past the limits
for two weeks
that's dumb it's gonna result in bad
things
unless you're one of the super lucky
ones and you can survive it and be
okay that's not how pro-bodybuilders
make gains that's not how anyone makes
gains
unless you're super super lucky it's
just a formula for high risk of injury
and just a shitty fucking time and
probably no muscle gain to show for it
or a minimal one
or an amount you could have done with
much less training okay if you have ego
problems go join an mma gym and get
punched in the face
when you come to the gym to do
hypertrophy training do your best
because remember you're there to grow
muscle not to challenge yourself
arbitrarily you want to challenge
yourself take up
marathon run it's way harder than
anything you can do in the weight room
afterwards deload big okay
don't do if you survive a block of of
this crazy training
don't just go back to normal training
deload take at least a week of
really easy training that's when a lot
of these things are going to express
themselves that's maybe when you get
a lot more muscle growth and the
realization of this muscle growth occurs
and you drop all the fatigue you've
accumulated so the next program you
start fresh
can actually be fresh instead of taking
all that fatigue during the buildup
and carrying it over into your next
program poisoning that next program as
well
right after that deload assess your
results so that you know
either damn i'm onto some good shit i'm
going to repeat this every now and again
or then this is good shit but it was
really fatiguing so i'm going to repeat
it
very rarely only when i'm in the at the
top of a masking phase eating a ton of
food resting a ton
or you're like that was fucking stupid i
didn't get shit out of it except a bum
knee
i'm not probably going to do that again
for either a long time or ever
or you know you get halfway through and
you have to deal it because you got hurt
or you got burned out and you're like
well fuck that
so be intelligent be smart those are the
same thing
ease in don't rush
that one program that's gonna solve all
your problems and get you those crazy
gains you never thought was possible
does not fucking exist i don't sell it
we don't sell it on rp
nobody else has it either good
programming
is about finding out the basic general
principles
of training harder the last time there
you go a little greg does that
impression for you it's too easy it's
iago from aladdin you guys don't know
that already
training harder than last time making
sure that
the eventually you hit failure and
eventually you're really challenging
yourself
deloading and repeating picking the
exercises to stimulate your muscles with
minimum fatigue to your joints so on and
so forth
and playing around with whatever volumes
starting from the low end
going up a little higher whatever
volumes get you your best growth
that's training and all that requires
knowing the principles and then
customizing them
them to yourself nobody has a
pre-packaged program
to sell you that's going to solve all of
your problems for you at once or get you
this miracle growth you've never gotten
we've got programs in rp i fucking
design them shits and the only thing i
can say for them is
they do that process i just described
calmly slowly carefully and they work
pretty well
right i'm fucking trying to sell you
guys programs and all i can say is they
work pretty well there's no miracles
what do you think i'm gonna say about
programs i haven't made folks
be patient do your best don't fall for
bullshit and if you're gonna try some
crazy shit
ease into it see you next time
you
