big push
yes that's it
good stuff good stop wow you guys need a
pillow underneath right all right here
we go
[Music]
Jimmy house
built like a brick effing house
it shows up to the gym today and I'm
like just kind of walking past and he's
like
get out of my way bro and I was like I'm
sorry
what
so he knee barred me my knee flew off my
shit because he's a black belt in Jiu
Jitsu no joke and I was in the bathroom
just like oh at least he's on a ton of
drugs stupid drug addict and he's like
I'm actually drug-free and I was like
can you just leave why are you in the
bathroom I'm in here crying I locked the
door he ripped the door off the hinges
but then as he was about to do a final
finishing blow Amazo AKA Jared feather
ifb Pro teleported in picked up Jimmy
teleported him to the Moon let him cool
off for a bit teleported him back couple
seconds of out of breath and then he was
like why don't we just just hey let's
just do a push workout so we can get
chest really messed up maybe a bit of
triceps and everyone was like okay
fine
so let's just do that right now let's
just go do that
[Music]
exercise number one is the cambered bar
bench press
looks like that except for the camber
really tough exercise critical to
descend slowly and take a pause so you
maximize that stretch under load
you might not be able to touch your
chest
if you can go for it but if you can't
just go as deep as you can and as you're
coming down you want to reach your chest
up to meet the bar which means you have
a nice arch in your back but firmly
planted on the seat feet really stable
to generate a lot of power and stability
and then you're good to go we're going
to be doing sets of oh five to 15 reps
eight to twelve more likes and um
I'm sure it's gonna get crazy hacks are
gonna be pretty destroyed after this and
then probably another pack exercise
let's do it
big arch
one more
let's go nice balls reach that chest
oh yeah
thank you
great thank you in regards to minimizing
the explosion that's just a more like
time under tension is what or safety
safe okay exploding out of that big of a
stretch could be the last exploding you
do with a full pack okay sounds good
once you get really big and strong
especially with this variation you want
to ease it up and then accelerate okay
at the bottom is cool with regular bench
but with that big of a stretch it'd be
something
probably you'll be safe
but the fraction fractional probability
of injury goes up
um it's important to have your pecs
still attached to your body right
definitely for power lifting because
you'll never press heavy ever again
uh and for sure for bodybuilding because
the pecs look weird when they come apart
that was fucking great oh thanks
you doing any more top sets
we'll go down
[Music]
[Music]
bottle of testosterone oil yeah wait
wait
it goes in the eyes right 100 then you
can see you told me you drink it
[Music]
yes
big chest
yes one more let's go
oh shit one more Jimmy all fucking day
big chest reach
[Music]
one more you got it keep going reach up
yeah
[Applause]
oh that was beautiful
yes nice yes dude hell yes
foreign
yeah let's do some dumbbells Mike isn't
training today because he did the two
and a half to one Paradigm two and a
half weeks of hard training and decided
he needed a dealer week so he's just
still living all week after two weeks so
nothing
[Music]
seated barbell shoulder press
is not an exercise we'll be doing today
I'm just sitting down because I'm tired
you guys real talk I'm old I'm getting
old I hate when people say that shut up
old man still gotta train
anyway rants aside incline dumbbell
presses hit the clavicular portion of
the pecs the cues we're going to be
looking for here are big reach up and we
want the dumbbells to come to the
outsides of the shoulders they did a lot
of Jiu Jitsu yesterday so I can't move
my fucking shoulder but it would look
something like that big reach
pause at the bottom for that super deep
stretch sets up 10 to 15 10 to 20
anything less is going to end up being
a requisite of stability
for that low of reps that high of a load
that we cannot achieve with dumbbells
dumbbells are inherently unstable and
thus better for slightly higher reps
because the lower rep training is only
best when you can get stable enough to
produce maximum forces because lower
reps are for producing maximum forces
because with dumbbells you really can't
get that stable sets of five to ten for
the dumbbell press not the smartest
thing in the world
good control
we chop
deep pause
yeah one more at least
reach up deep
oh shit hell yeah that's good enough
good enough look at how big as fuck
Jimmy is big ass packs big ass arms
could you imagine a world in which you
walked up to him before his workout and
be like you do an incline that Mill
press you'd be like yeah look how much
you pressed bro what are you thinking
he's gonna say 131 41.50 he says 70.
proper execution good technique slow
eccentric deep pause to outside the
chest means you don't have to dumbbell
press Ultra fucking heavy
and you still get these maximum amazing
effects minimum stress on your joints
maximum stress on the muscles it is
fucking humbling the ego will not like
it
[Music]
foreign
yes
oh and that extra milk
oh amazing
[Music]
yep
big reach
deep yes
one more one more one more one
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
huge chest yes
one more
[Music]
break break break that's it that's right
no thank you let me tell you guys about
the RP hypertrophy app with over 28
preset programs already in the app you
can choose to make your own you can
modify an existing program or you can
just run the programs exactly as they
were written by me personally this app
programs everything for you exercises
weights sets reps frequency the whole
thing after every single workout on
every single week the app adjusts to
your unique parameters with every single
input we have over 250 exercises in the
app with detailed video tutorial links
to every single one you never have to be
confused about technique or form ever
again I'm guessing right now you're
pretty interested in the app download
the RP hypertrophy app today
all right last exercise for today's push
workout is cable tricep push Downs
supersettered to some close grip
push-ups and I think we'll probably try
a deficit so let me see if I get some
blocks for a steps to push up with
ouch pain is impending set of 15 to 20
here on a first set hopefully and then
uh all the way down probably about three
or four sets really get some good tricep
volume one thing you can take away from
some of this advice is
when you do chest first but you have a
chest tricep session or you want to give
good stimulus to triceps a lot of times
it'll be like three sets of chest in the
first exercise three sets in the second
and then like four or five steps for
triceps in the last why because you're
already tired but you can make up some
stimulus by just doing a higher volume
of work at the end give that some
thought let's go do these push Downs
beautiful
[Music]
yep one more
[Music]
on the body
yes
as if you're gonna do another oh okay
you're good you're gonna go go go go go
you're good okay push-ups
go
deep
strict
one more Jimmy
deep
let's go big push
yes yeah that's it good shit good stuff
good stop wow you guys need a pillow
underneath right all right here we go
so terrible let's go Jared
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I need to stand up all the way out okay

[Music]
amazing right away
another one let's go
[Music]
another one right away go slow
one more small up
what the fuck was that lock it out Jimmy
all the way one rep there you go
good stuff and
oh
that was awesome thanks bro thank you
Mike amazing amazing amazing effort
you know what they say is get you a man
that can blink
we get you a man that can do slow and
controlled eccentrics and Myra tricep
push-up super set
and you'll be eating good you got two of
them got two man I'm breaded up I'm
manned up
anyway
Jimmy what do you think
I think my biggest takeaway from the day
was the alteration on the dumbbell
presses as far as for one kind of taking
my power lifting setup out of the
equation not being as
uh driven with my legs but still using
my legs to get to an upper body position
that allows full range of motion
like I was telling you with the bigger
dumbbells I generally press neutral to
try to get down lower but then after
talking to Jared and some of the
alterations that he makes to still go
really flared but not necessarily let
the dumbbells get in the way that's
something I'm going to take home for
sure
and then going for something like a
isolated cable push down go into true
failure with that and then go into more
of a compound body weight movement to
put push even more volume to the triceps
like the push-up that was a huge
takeaway for me too and just
understanding what true failure of a
muscle group is is something that I
think I've gathered the last couple of
days so I appreciate you guys for that
awesome you did incredible thank you
Jared you're looking big
me
kind of washed up done I'm done lifting
forever we're never going to be back
this last video on this channel it's
been real we'll see you guys never peace
can we ever deal with thoughts like
thoughts you shouldn't have maybe like
jacking off and like think about a girl
but then like 10 turns into a guy at the
end or your mother nut you really like
it grandma
of course not honey
[Laughter]
