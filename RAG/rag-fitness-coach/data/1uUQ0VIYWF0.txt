this is my worm hold up
hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization charlie john and jared
feather oh and also works for team paul
rom but you know what i'm saying we're
in the mix with all that ish
on the other hand we're doing a push
workout today we got inclined camber
guard bed what click bait at work
and then we have some push downs and we
have some dips jared's going to do a
little bit more chest work maybe charlie
will as well i don't do so much chest
work because my chest is really
sensitive and big and it would just get
too sore
we're going to do this vlog style which
apparently you fucking young tik talkers
love
and there's going to be minimal edits
there's going to be us warming up and
walking around and talking to each other
and you can really feel like we're
friends
only we're not friends because we don't
have friends this is sham it's all
corporate facing we don't even charlie
doesn't even speak english he memorizes
lines for dating
he doesn't know what they mean so when
you guys think like oh there's a
chemistry you know charlie and jared
and jared hates everybody sort of live
so anyway love you guys all let's do
some
branch press
you guys good you guys good yeah we
didn't prompt charlie he's just yeah
let's do it
first exercise incline very slight
incline
cambered bar bench press
why incline because i can't do these
flat i can't reach all the way down
and when i pull an arch flat my back
doesn't like that interferes with my
back days
incline auto archers for me i don't have
to use my musculature arch because
gravity does that
and the movement feels pretty good if i
do this
for sets of 10 to 20 reps
and uh with a nice pause and everything
jared's behind the camera talking that
ish
so who knows what he's saying let's get
it done oh this thing feels really close
is that okay
my shoulder hurts
you're such a fucking
bitch mike i'm just better than you at
everything show up i'm so good but i'm
always hurt but i could be better but i
don't want to lift
goddamn
shouldn't go that low it's bad for your
knees
all right guy at the gym you shouldn't
lock out either that's also bad 3ds also
what's your target reps at least 14 to
20. i want a set of 20 at 225. holy shit
you just go as low as you can and take a
nice pause
he's ready
[Music]
18 something
nice
good job you get like an extra inch of
stretch which i'm sure is pretty
valuable yeah you can feel that extra
shit right oh yeah
that feels nice
scott real quick just before you
continue to film jared
not there's not a number of these thick
professional looking cords that will
make up for your shitty videography
[Laughter]
so everyone knows how you actually treat
good shit like the shit you deserve
[Music]
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
where am i
[Music]
so
[Music]
fuck yeah jared
[Music]
what's the spider web up there good good
let's go get stronger for the spider to
not kill you
the spider's also doing canvas
shut the fuck up
you gotta be stronger you gotta scare
them away jared
guys
don't you remember i'm a fucking bitch
and i'm afraid of spiders god damn
i usually do two chest movements
and then flies
right yeah so i'm doing chest fly chest
oh you're more okay here we go are you
cool with that yeah yeah i'm doing like
a sandwich what compound isolation
jerry are you serious what can you free
motion fly
why i do push downs on that i thought
you're doing
no no dips are third
push downs
are you sure you can do push downs over
there
push downs on the free motion
look the free motion's ideally designed
for flies i don't like
the free motion for flies at all this is
way better
this isn't because this when you come up
like this after you get put to pass here
are you doing these kind of most
muscular flies yeah that's dumb you need
more lower pectoral
your lower pack small
i was just
doing an incline after this
also i've been with you and put my shit
in you're keeping it high i'll dom in
with you sure that's good yeah okay i'll
just switch in
all right folks
done doing cambered bench
we're on to
the guys are doing flies
but i have a slightly different workout
so
i'm doing
cable tricep push downs
my shit is in the
10 to 20 rep range
mile reps
myo rep match so the first set i do
normal straight set get maybe 20 reps or
so the second set is going to be my rep
match probably two sets
super sensitive to volume right now just
took a little half deload
i'm ready to go the guys are doing flies
so a little flex magazine photo shoot
type shit let's do let's do it
[Music]
uh
[Music]
what's up for your warm-up
[Music]
um
[Music]
i mean crossfit 91.
come on baby come on
winners win
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
all the cutie juices
hey goosey
bye gucci
[Laughter]
[Music]
nice
what is it 50
70. i assume you're gonna cut that into
the clip
charlie goes outside
play the audio
all right i did cambered bar bench
incline
my rep push downs
and then it's dips
i just need to do a total of 40 reps of
dips
um however many sets it takes already
one set did 10. see how many i get on
this one
dips after a
ton of push downs are really weird so
hit your triceps a ton my muscle
connection is crazy but like you just
can't do that many because your triceps
are a huge limiting factor which is
awesome and they feel like the limiting
factor every single rep but you can't do
as much which is kind of cool
because like if i do dips fresh i can
put these weights on and stuff
this kind of simplifies it maximum uh
same as fatigue ratio
minimum load on the joints etcetera so
that's all good stuff let's do some dips
and i don't know what the guys are doing
fuck these guys the guys did incline
then they did
flies
off with cable and then they did some
incline dumbbell press so they had much
more of a chest focus because they come
in later this afternoon i do just
shoulders and biceps they're gonna do
shoulders biceps and triceps so little
different ways of skinning the cat but
remember the cat hates all those ways
[Music]
ah
[Music]
yep
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah come on
[Music]
oh
that's it for triceps
but i have some grip
forearm curls to do i superset them
forearm curls on the free motion machine
it's a little
forearm push aways
on the free motion machine three sets
each one's a super set
let's get these done
no particularly in-depth reason
why they're at the end of my push
workout
when they interfere with
the least but they're not tired from
pulling
big forms make your
every pose look cooler
and
guys like it girls like it
grandpa sits next to you on the plane
you loose honey can i touch your
forearms
you win
[Music]
oh
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
