bend your knees slightly if you have
stronger adductors point your feet
further out if you have stronger vast
lateralis or quad sweep point and move
forward stick your butt out slightly to
engage rectus femoris more form a fist
with your hands excluding your thumbs
anchor your thumbs into the side of your
torso the exact point of which it should
be done will depend on your build but a
good starting point is around your navel
height bring your elbows out to the side
until they are in line with your torso
from the side
this will flare your lats
take a big breath in then take shallow
frequent nasal breaths to maintain your
vacuum and abdominal positioning
make sure your knees hips shoulders

so hard that you lose positioning can't
hold the pose or start shaking

forget to smile
