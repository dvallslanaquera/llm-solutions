[Music]
yo what up it's me Dr Mike Jared feather
ifb Pro and uh I was like yeah we need
somebody on the channel but there's got
to be a few things
bikini
training lower body but um he's like
well a lot of her her her and I was like
somebody with an old school British name
like some 1920s some Titanic type shit
and Miss Evelyn here
is oh so fancy my word Evelyn darling
you feeling good I'm feeling great and
that's the last time you're gonna say
that shit for the next hour hit it
all right show us what you think of sumo
Squad is
no that's tying your shoes Evelyn that's
not a suit that's not a cinema thought
these look really good so one thing I'll
say whenever people Sumo Squad is that
they hear Sumo and they think wide
stance it's a wide stand Squat and human
spot's a little different put your feet
a little more narrow
and then point your toes out a little
more and then it's going to come from
the hips so your knees always track
outward so basically push it out your
knee out towards your pinky toe open
your hips a whole bunch
more open your hips yeah open your hips
open your hips
[Music]
up so as you start to squat down really
force your hips open it's going to be
uncomfortable almost
open even more even more even more out
out out yes yeah two more squats
exercise number one
the position here is toes out
really letting your feet come out as you
go down and pushing your butt as far
back as possible to get that big stretch
on the glutes we like a slow eccentric
we like a pause at the bottom to really
accentuate The Eccentric and the stretch
loaded position which are very very tie
divertrophy you accentuate the top and
the squeeze there's not a whole lot
there that causes a ton of muscle growth
not nearly as much as a big deep stretch
and a slow eccentric these are brutal
most people think they can do a lot of
weight until they do it properly and
they can either do a lot of weight nor
is it feeling any fun but your glutes
get huge and you go to the grocery store
and you're like
and the boys are like oh my God is that
like really like yeah it's real I'm real
I'm a real woman oh yeah do you want to
like do it and you're like yeah what if
I do I'm like okay fine

[Laughter]
I've been training bikini girls a long
time
you are one of the fucking rare girls
that can push this hard thank you you
were you weren't kidding and so on the
next sets I want you to go to that place
again you know when you start nodding
now
we want you to think now the fun starts
okay now I can do more okay because if
you can't stand up we just got you we
got you we'll just pull it right out
here you're not getting hurt the worst
thing that happens is your quads hurt
like shit and you run out of air you're
tough as fucking nails
let me tell you guys about something
about being tough when you're training
it doesn't matter how much you screen
you cannot scream or you can scream a
ton if you cry it doesn't mean you're
not tough or that you're pushing
yourself in that you are tough you can
cry or not cry it doesn't matter what
really makes you tough in training is
this is when the Reps get really fucking
hard and your whole body is not a no and
your coach or your inner demons or
whoever the hell is around Dr Mike I'm
an RPI purchase app says do another one
do two more do three more you go you
know what yes yes I don't care I don't
care I will fucking die here of course
die is metaphoric because nobody's
fucking dying in the gym I will push
myself to my limits because I want
Ascension more than I want to just stay
the same that's tough whatever it
doesn't matter how much you're lifting
50 pounds 500 pounds when it's one more
rep in the fucking tank one more rep
loaded into the clip you fucking do it
and then you do it again and you do it
again because you don't care if you live
or die you just care one more rep that's
tough this Evelyn is real tough It's
actually quite impressive it's just way
tougher than me I already said it for
you can't make fun of me now
let's go do actual RAR training the
chest it's open
speed
and one one last one
last one slow open open
big chest wait
up fast go go one more bonus round one
motion yes yes the answer is yes hit it
right now no rest slow okay we're here
to get all fucking days
stand up stand up stand up rack oh my
God that's so gorgeous
somebody trying today
that felt so good
guys
[Music]
next up we are going to do good mornings
which means it's a stifling and deadlift
with a bar on your back so you're taking
a nice comfortable stance feet shoulder
width apart toast a little bit out
you're gonna push your butt back and
you're gonna take your butthole and show
it to the corner between the ceiling and
the back wall
like that would you keep your chest up
your tummy out and your knees are going
to want to go forward but you're going
to want to push them back
pain in the hamstrings is how you know
this is right and if you need more pain
you push your knees back more butt back
more arch your chest up more and it's
going to be everything slow on the way
down quickly what sets two on the lower
sets of five to ten I can talk I promise
it's my job
so that's a five to ten reps Evelyn is
beyond warmed up so we're just gonna get
her and uh apply her first set right
away be stable
up one last one hit it
[Music]
spot back there you go he's back one of
them he's back one inch lower and it
holds for a second
and then up
good job
[Music]
solid solid solid also feel bad in your
hamstrings yeah yeah
good good yeah good so what do you do to
like stay in shape
two last ones here let's go
push the butt back as far as you can and
the knees back too
he's back more
yes up one last one hit it I want this
one deep and I want you to hold it for a
second at the bottom begin come on go go
go go go go go
[Music]
I stop knees back deep come on
hold
hold and up wrap
[Music]
gorgeous oh yeah
just awesome hell yeah good stuff
that was very humbling you did great
[Music]
oh hey guys
Evelyn's doing great
sumo squats good mornings now it's pain
time as if that wasn't
lunges
with a barbell
Jared's gonna warm her up right now and
then we'll get to it
the thing with walking lunges is how
Jared does them which is the better way
you focus on using your back leg only as
a pivot and anchor just so you don't
fall and all of the load goes through
that front leg or as much of it as
possible why because the front leg here
is the one getting the glute stretched
this is where the glute hypertrophy
comes from the back leg is the
supporting leg so we're going to have
her stay nice and upright slowly come
down all the way using that front leg so
you're going to be looking at me why is
she struggling and then she can do a few
more reps I thought she was struggling
mostly it's because on the few reps that
she started a struggle she was cueing
her front leg only and that's really
hard then she pushed more of the back
leg it got easier we're going to re-cute
her for that front leg she ended up
getting multiple approaches to failure
for the glutes which is amazing
[Music]
better
stretch front leg only no back leg
assistance there it is yeah
all right
[Music]
last one
good
stuff you're going up more weights
consider that a long warm-up
is going to be much heavier you're going
to do it the exact same way
[Music]
press
[Music]
do it again go go go go go
[Music]
again
don't speed them up
[Music]
let's go
and
up there not help me get it dude this uh
I'm gonna get a heavier weight yeah this
is ridiculous it's like 80 reps song as
fuck super strong
I feel that 20 pound difference
oh it's 90. just kidding
good right away go come on front leg
him hurt
[Music]
good right away go go go go go go go go
[Music]
good again go go go go no nodding no
nodding just go slow
yeah
up again a couple more reps and you're
done you're definitely
make it hard on yourself
that's why you're here oh yes exactly
again go great yes go go go two more
steps and you're done slow
up one last one go
slow come up on that front leg no
bullshit up
fuck yeah
[Music]
WordPress cool
[Music]
open open open
keep going keep going keep going
God damn this that's up
lunges are done that was brutal tough to
watch easy to coach last exercise is
going to be the leg press just two sets
here with a little RP patented squat
bullshit don't tell her afterwards of
course and uh she goddamn she works hard
she's gonna be tough sets of uh 10 to 20
reps probably my rep
you've been on the channel before you
know how it is if you haven't stay tuned
because this is going to hurt so many
reps that you can do wait three or four
seconds breathe a little bit at the top
and then more probably two my rep brakes
like that within each set two sets total
would grab her get her out have her do
some Sumo Squad and they hit those boots
a little bit more at the very end
when you're done go
[Music]

very hard I want you to stand right over
here I'll show you again and you're
going to face that one you're going to
take your sumo squat position and you're
going to have your hands up and you're
going to do as many squats as it takes
