hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization healthy eating made simple
video number two
making balanced meals so
last time in healthy eating number one
which if you haven't seen you should
before watching this
we learned what healthy foods were and
we said that
you should just be me eating more
healthy foods and less junky stuff
totally cool
does that mean that you can just have
like a meal of apples
and peanut butter like it totally can
absolutely
but for a best possible health we can do
a little bit better than that
and that is building actual meals
and each meal checks a few boxes for us
so
once you're used to picking healthy
foods you know what they are you've
gotten into the habit of going to the
store buying the right stuff so on and
so forth
you should probably begin to have a
little bit more structure
okay to your meals so your meals now
that you're eating most of them should
begin to have a few
core ingredients first and most
important is a core of
lean protein which means a lean protein
either vegan
or the animal product of some kind um
that is a portion about the size of your
fist so like
my fists are i guess medium sized this
much salmon or this much
uh you know chicken or this much turkey
or something like that this much
lean tofu whatever you like to eat that
should be the core of every single meal
in addition to that something like 8 to
12 ounces
of some kind of dairy product or protein
shake or vegan protein shake or anything
else you want okay
so at the core of each meal we start
every meal with protein super important
to keep your muscularity up to keep your
energy up to keep your
everything your blood sugar stable so on
and so forth protein is great and it
keeps you super super full
so good start there second
ingredient is a serving of veggies now
it can be anywhere between roughly the
size of your fist to four times the size
of your fist depending on how many
veggies you want to eat
no wrong answers between the two some
people like to eat a lot of veggies i
think they taste good they fill them up
a ton and really crush hunger
some people they don't like veggies a
ton but they should make an effort to
try to eat at least a small minimal
serving size of that
it is best that your veggies are either
grilled
steamed or raw and all of those are
totally fine you just don't want to like
soak them in a ton of fat and then say
hey it's a veggie i ate a french fry
technically veggie
that doesn't count right so the more
fresh the better grilled and steamed are
totally fine as well
once you have your protein and veggie
core you can
add either whole grains and or fruits
and or add healthy fats right whole
grains of any kind work super well
whole grain breads are totally fine
fruit
is best fresh not blended into a shake
because that gives you less fullness and
make you more hungry later
and not like doused in syrup or
something like that so like canned
peaches
fresh peaches awesome healthy fats nuts
nut butters avocados
oils of various kinds are totally cool
and if you cook
some of your carbs or some of your
proteins in oils that are healthy
you're getting sort of two two birds
with one stone perfectly fine
now the protein core and the veggie core
especially the protein is not mandatory
but a really good idea
right but how do you know how much fruit
or grain to add
uh and how much added healthy fats to
add if any
those are dictated by two things hunger
uh in energy level needs if you're
running low on energy have some more
carbs if you're
uh running low uh if you're pretty
hungry have some more carbs or more fats
totally fine
and preference okay some folks would
like to eat lots of healthy fats
but not so many carbs totally fine some
folks 50 50 some folks mostly carbs
very few fats that's 100 fine you can
even have meals
that have protein and veggies and no
added whole grains or fruits
totally okay or ones with no added
healthy fats that's 100
fine no wrong answers here no big deal
either way
now veggies and snacking a couple of
questions that are going to be super
common so we'll just preempt them here
like we're talking about making meals
are snacks bad you can totally have
snacks but we prefer that they meet sort
of three criteria
first try to make them protein based
protein bars and shakes
are really really good because they
check that protein box for us and they
keep us fuller longer which means if we
have protein based snacks
won't be as likely to increase our
calorie consumption because snacking
like on goldfish or something like that
not real goldfish the cracker
snacking on real goldfish should be
quite quite quite a horrific thing to
see in real life
so if you're snacking on goldfish all
the time you know the carbs there they
don't even make you very full there's no
protein core
all of a sudden your food intake is
exactly the same for the day except all
plus the goldfish you're hypercaloric
you end up eating too many calories for
what you're burning and then you're
gaining weight you're becoming less
healthy right but if you have a protein
core for a snack that's a really really
good thing
number two make sure the snacks are
healthy stuff okay
potato chips and soda in a candy bar
crappy snack so when you say snack that
doesn't mean you divert completely from
your philosophy of eating mostly healthy
foods
keep your snacks healthy there's tons of
options there and lastly
we would prefer that you only snack when
you really
needed to fit your schedule you can't
fit in a meal thus you have to have a
snack
if you have time for a meal it's
probably better to have a good
filling whole food meal for long-term
sustainability of these healthy
practices
next question do you have to eat veggies
every meal
grandma said you do mom said you do you
don't
okay if your evening meal for example is
greek yogurt and fruit
amazing you don't have to put broccoli
in there that's
awful okay but for most main veals
uh for most of your main meals try to
get some veggies in they're really
really good for health
they crush hunger so if you have more
veggies there are very few calories
all of a sudden you're not as hungry and
you can have a lower calorie environment
that provides you all your the nutrients
that you need veggies are chock full of
nutrients
it's good all around
that's it for making basic meals it's
that simple now the transition from just
eating healthy foods
all the way into you you have core meals
and you know how to make them and every
time you eat you know that you got to
have your protein and your veggie and
your carbs and fats
that can take for some people a week or
less and for others it can take a month
or even longer and there's no rush and
this is going to be the last slide for
almost every one of these series
because there's never any rush we want
you to take all the time you need to
transition to healthier eating for the
long term for the forever
versus rushing and trying to do a good
job and then falling off the wagon and
all of a sudden
you're eating hot dogs for lunch again
with fried hot dogs and
no bun i don't even know what you're
doing all right
four once you have your meals that
you're eating
core good meals with healthy foods
you're ready for your next diet change
so you're eating mostly healthy foods
and you're eating those healthy foods in
well-balanced meals
the first part of that how to eat
healthy was covered in the last video so
feel free
to go back how to construct good meals
balanced meals was covered in this video
once you are there and you're eating
these good meals
we can do a little bit better still and
we'll see you then for our next video
in this series
