last day
of the video series
it's saturday for us
which means we have a push
shoulder bicep and forearm workout but
typically we do shoulder biceps and
forearms
on their own session
split off
it would be am pm but
pushing for charlie and i especially
and for jared as well by the way jared
had to run here to catch a flight
was going to insert some kind of excuse
column white trash we already know he is
for charlie and i especially the amount
of physical work we have to do to
stimulate chest and triceps because
we're so glued in from our power lifting
days and technique and because we've
been working on our stimulus to fatigue
ratio so much and because we're pretty
fast twitch for our chest rollers
triceps that it's just not a ton of work
so if we did this as an am pm session
the am session would be done in like 40
minutes so we'd look at each other and
be like okay i guess we'd have to come
back later today so we can combine them
and it's not a problem because the
systemic fatigue from the push session
is so low we can hit shoulders biceps
and forearms after and not be limited
systemically thus it's not junk falling
thus it's effective so that's the deal
let's join in let's have some fun first
exercise up is going to be machine chest
press we got us a nautilus machine chest
brush feels oh good thank you nautilus
company is amazing or whoever bought you
cybex life and so that loads you now
in any case after that quick preview we
are going to do inverted skull crushers
and my rep style of course and then
after that we're going to do some dips
our triceps are going to be so pretty
exhausted charlie and i typically use
weights for dips we don't have to
because we're just going to be half dead
it's going to be awesome take a couple
cool picks and videos of us pumped up
rest just a tiny bit five or 10 minutes
and then hit up shoulders biceps and of
course
forearms yeah yeah yeah let's do it
[Music]
charlie i'm going to do four sets of
10 to 20 rep rep range
always a pause always controlled
eccentric
chest presses targeting the chest and
triceps of course then we move on to
triceps after with some inverted skull
pressures
let's get the work done
[Music]
um
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you might want to wait like 30 seconds
fuck it got to me right here wrong
huh oh i fucking saw right here
trespass is done four sets
now
three sets
of
maya rep style inverted skull pressures
set the bar to whichever height gives
you the reference you want
my reps means you can rest
several seconds between the little mini
sets each one going close to failure
first set
i hit 25 reps
after that
i did as many many sets as it takes for
the other two sets
to get to 25 each time
so
tough a lot of approaches to failure
huge tricep pump
the way you progress on this typically
in the short term is to add reps every
week once you exit your rep range let's
say
you got more than 25 you got to start to
get 46 and that's not that hard
then you take the bar and put it lower
if you can do this next to the ground
good technique
for a sense of 20 plus
if i have big ass triceps
[Music]
you go charlie milk them out
[Music]
getting pumped
yeah
good
hey folks dr mike here with charlie jung
jared feather team full rom
we want to hear your guys feedback on
what are the advantages of having a
coach
charlie hit it because jared is also i
don't think i just do
right
how liberating is that i don't think i
don't have to worry about what i'm doing
if i'm doing
enough about if i'm doing too little
just i just
as long as i trust the person
that's coaching me hashtag trust yeah
trust which you know if you hire a coach
you just trust them right
you're paying not from one of your
stories a few weeks ago would please go
on
um but yeah uh yeah it's just and that
alone
the amount of stress reduction you get
from that
it's
it's worth it man yeah
ugh
[Music]
mile wraps
why you do me like that
oh
oh
oh
oh
it's time for dips
four sets no wait
super deep stretch i'll be pausing mine
charlie may choose pause for dynamic
super deep stretch control a lot of
people ask how much should i tilt should
i push my feet back feet forward should
i stay upright stay bent it's all down
to you and where you get the best image
figure ratio for chest and for triceps
people also ask a question of or dips
for lower packs are they for triceps
they're for both they're for both
let's get them done
[Music]
[Music]
jared what's the advantage of having a
coach you've been self-coached your
whole life okay you do talk to joe
jeffrey you talked to broadway i just
started talking to you talk to charlie
how do at least those conversations in a
pseudo coaching bouncing ideas matter
how yeah it's awesome you get to uh
you know
verify if what you're thinking at that
time was uh
kind of like a off-the-cuff thought or
if it's like something that you're
sitting there logically thinking out
you present it to your you know your
friends or whoever you're consulting
with and you know they can tell you
things you maybe didn't think about um
offer you
different ideas but
you know having a plan in place and then
auto regulating is the most important
thing
and the coach gets to help you
unregulate so the conversations we have
are the auto regulation and it's awesome
it's quite objective too yeah it's great
it's very objective so it's like i set
the plan in motion i know exactly what i
need to do i know exactly where my
volume is going to change from like this
rep range to this rep range where i'm
going to start including intensity
techniques i know when my diet's going
to change usually generally
and then whenever certain changes are
approaching that's when i call some
friends or you broader you even talk to
charlie a few times about stuff
um
and just kind of like hey here's what
i'm planning going forward
uh what do you think about this you know
this uh sort of switch up because i
thought thought it through and maybe
this is better at this period of time
you ever seen that video on the internet
it's called switch hitters switch
hitters do you know what that is it
sounds like a porn it's an adult it's an
adult genre yeah it sounds like i just
had to say it yeah that's great please
go on
and then we uh we switch it and it's
great i come over it's fun time
[Music]
how many was that
[Music]
[Music]
yes
[Music]
chest triceps and front delts are over
now it's time for biceps shoulders and
forearms for biceps first exercise
is
this kind of sort of easy curl looking
attachment for the cable curl i'm going
to be doing my rep sets three sets
based on my progressions over the last
couple weeks i have a straight set of 22
reps nice high reps i have another uh
one of these earlier in the week which
you already saw in an earlier video much
same exercise but heavier
22 reps and then i come back and hit it
another two times
trying to get 22 again however many rest
breaks that takes charlie's going to do
a similar thing
yahoo
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh
that hit it
work out it's getting tough
free motion
basically kind of y raises
t raises i don't know crossbiter to get
the stretch for the side delts all the
way back and all the way down hit some
of the back which is cool some of the
middle and upper traps
but it really does hit the side delts
because as you pull back that is the
prime mover
four sets
maya reps a lot of volume
a lot of stimulus this is my last
productive stimulative workout for the
entire prep season
i compete in a week so i'm gonna fucking
turn it up this is charlie second to
last week of this prep
let's get it done
[Applause]
oh
[Music]
fuck yeah
last exercise today
forearm curls
it's uh
just another variation cool to do on the
free motion no crazy advantages this
isn't a life hack just getting forms
done some other way a bunch of different
ways to do them good nice good full
range of motion real quick back to back
to back very minimal rest
[Music]
it's coaching coaching is an
unbelievable thing
because of what charlie said it can
really destress the flock out of you and
it can give you guidance and wisdom from
someone who has known before another
thing that's interesting
is the idea of having a community of
like-minded people around
to help push you to help pull you back
to answer questions to look at videos of
techniques to look at your diet to set
you up with a plan
and that's exactly what we're doing at
team full rom in our facebook community
there
um
we've been doing it for a little bit now
it's been pretty successful we've got
some people in the forum and what do you
guys uh what are you guys gonna tell
people so they go sign up and give us
money okay well what we do all full rom
is basically like i treat it very much
like my coaching so if you have
technique uh questions people are
sending the technique through i'm
sending them zooms i'm making sure that
they know exactly what i think they
should fix other people are watching it
they're making comments on it things
like that so it's very cool it's very
interesting and i i enjoy it a lot you
get
tons of training resources right away
like literal programs to do we even
picked jared and i designed all the
programs we picked the exercises and the
way the rp setup works is you can unpick
them if you don't like them so yes you
