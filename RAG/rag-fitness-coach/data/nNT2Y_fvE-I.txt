hey folks doctor mike here for front
sounds puritization welcome back
to the fitness myths series
and uh
question can you out cardio a bad diet
no that's why it's a myth but hold on we
can do better than just yelling at you
here's what we're going to do we're
going to take a look at the claim
specifically i'm going to talk about why
it's wrong we are going to cut it slack
and talk about the grains of truth it
might have and then we are going to end
up at best practices and what you can
take away from this video to actually
get more jacked and leaner and to
finally make friends
so
the claim
a lot of times it's kind of like this
people say shit like well endurance
athletes eat whatever they want and
they're still skinny and lean so like
you don't need to follow a diet to get
lean um
some truth in there
and a lot of times that transfers into
like man i don't want to do anything
about my diet i'm just going to work out
a lot more
let's find out
how that's a problem because it sounds
like you know activity intake maybe
there's a balance but hold on
first
reasons why you're probably not going to
out cardio
and eat anything you want diet reason
number one if you're eating junk food
which you almost certainly are if you
have some predilections against
controlling your diet
getting in a crazy amount of calories is
so easy to do
right like
we'll have a later video in like a year
or something where we break this down
more specifically but
if you have like three extra donuts
at the office christmas party you have
to run like eight miles or some shit to
burn that off
motherfucker you're not running eight
miles i'm not running eight miles fuck
that
right
if you look up the calories that foods
have
and you can go online and do this
yourself you go up and like get a
calculator there's all free online of
like if i weigh x y z amount of weight
and i'm this gender and i'm this height
how many miles do i have to run to burn
a certain number of calories it is
upsetting it's really cool in the
bioenergetic efficiency sense because
humans are so efficient
like
for like four apples you can get you can
power a human for like five miles of
running it's incredible
right uh on the other hand it was best
because we were designed in evolutionary
environment with food was very
constrained so we got really good at uh
doing a lot with a little problem our
current environment for most of you
watching probably all
is like food is almost free essentially
at the grocery store costs like a
nominal amount like how many hours do
you have to work through the day if you
make minimum wage in order to feed
yourself
for a day it's like half an hour or
something and then the other eight hours
or seven and a half you just you can
just eat to your heart's delight right
and so it turns out that yeah the body's
super efficient and it's just a lot
easier to eat the calories than it is to
burn them off
first point and why this whole like i'll
just eat whatever i want i'll just do
more usually falls through the cracks
point number two even if you could do
the work
training that much
is hard as fuck and takes an
unbelievable amount of time
almost everyone quits trying to do this
because if you really just eat whatever
you want you're gonna have to train
hours and hours and hours of hard
training in order to burn that off like
if it's already part of your lifestyle
to train that much
this video will seem weird to you anyway
because you're probably already in good
shape
because you're already living this
lifestyle but you're probably not you're
thinking not you specifically i don't
want to offend you the viewer but people
that say i'm just gonna out cardio this
diet fuck you know fuck worry about my
diet i'm gonna train really hard
they're usually
not the kind of people that are
currently training very hard
certainly not hard enough to get really
ultra lean without caring about the diet
at all
and
when
we say hard we mean
if you're just eating fuck all and you
don't have a low appetite to begin with
you need to be at a competitive
endurance athlete output levels training
levels daily weekly monthly levels in
order to stay lean eating that much food
that thing that it takes
to be an endurance athlete and fucking
grind the toughest people on earth
is what 99
of people that don't feel like cutting
their calories don't have
willpower okay so the reason you're
saying fuck it i'm not gonna control my
diet
i'm just gonna fucking do more activity
it's cause you're a little bitch
and you don't wanna fucking control your
diet because
to paraphrase ct fletcher you won't have
what it takes
you're gonna be that same guy
that also runs eight miles every day get
the fuck out of here no you're not
you're gonna do an extra three sets of
bicep curls motherfucker and you're
gonna stay gigantic
plain and simple
point number three
in a positive light now that i've
thoroughly insulted everyone listening
controlling your diet is not that hard
all right you can just eliminate most of
your junk food if you're the normal
person in america or western europe or
asia and you eat a normal amount of junk
food you just take almost all the junk
food out
you've bought yourself like
miles and miles and miles of not having
to run
so if you would have kept that junk food
in it'll be like okay you can keep this
in a still lose weight you have to run
five miles a day
okay okay okay what if i take out like
these three twinkies that i eat every
day or a little bit ice cream and
cookies and chips oh and don't forget
about the laffy taffy i love the fucking
candy my kids have it i have to have
if you take away 90 of that shit
congratulations you now have to run half
a mile a day to lose the same amount of
weight wait a minute
i have to run four and a half extra
fucking miles to have like three fucking
twinkies fuck that
how hard would it really be for me not
to have three twinkies a day like i
don't know
for weeks i wouldn't even remember that
i used to have twinkies i might feel
better not having them
versus be like i have to have my
twinkies non-negotiable okay
run four and a half extra miles like but
right now oh yeah start now you'll be
asleep by the time uh you'll be bedtime
by the time you're done
but i but i just had the i had the
twinkies just now and then i'll have gi
distress if i run like okay great we'll
just start tomorrow tomorrow you run
nine miles total because it'll be four
and a half miles behind like fuck
controlling your diet is not that hard
a lot of people think oh man i'm dieting
i have to cut all the carbs all the fats
fucking all the proteins too fucking i'm
just gonna starve that doesn't have to
be like that all you have to do is cut a
little bit of pro a little bit of fat a
little bit of carbs mostly from just
eating less junk or not at all
can you eat much less junk food for 12
weeks on end
probably
can you run 10 extra miles a day for 12
weeks on end no
almost certainly no the answer is no
point number four
so basically sorry real quick just to
end up point number three
when people say i'll just work harder
and thus don't have to control my diet
they don't understand what harder really
means
it's like saying oh yeah i heard you
like made it into the navy seals
congratulations i heard that was hard
it's not hard
it's insane
is it that hard then almost no one does
it ta-da right you don't want to like
make a plan
that is the
logical or analogical equivalent of like
yeah i'll just like uh just join the
navy seals fuck
i don't you know it's someone's like hey
do you want to take like a gun class and
some tactical fighting classes like i'll
just try it for the seals like
all right
why like yeah just like when i go in i
go all out you're the fucking man
have at it i'll see you in your navy
seal
point number four
sciency point
there's a thing called ponzer's paradox
herman poncer is the gentleman that
discovered it slash
sort of put it into the light
and it's the idea that humans
through the process of evolution have
adapted to do the following
if you ask them to do
10 percent more activity per day than
they normally accustomed to not much
changes they feel great they usually
lose weight and
oftentimes appetite doesn't even catch
up so they lose weight and get healthy
and all this other stuff
if you ask humans to do 50 more activity
than they're accustomed to it's going to
make them quite a bit tired and they're
not going to feel like doing a whole lot
more in their day so they're neat not
exercise activity to their genitals it's
just the normal jovialness moving around
starts to reduce just like it does on a
super uh crazy fat loss diet and all of
a sudden
you're doing you know 50 more formal
activity let's say you multiplied your
cardio by 50
the rest of the day is going to
automatically your body is going to
reduce how much it's moving it even
lowers its body temperature to some
extent and then all of a sudden you're
not burning 50 more than you
were like you thought you're burning
maybe 25 or 30 percent more
now here's the real kicker
if we drag that 50 excess up to 100
doing double the work that you normally
do per day double the calorie burning
let's see normally you burn 3000
calories as your maintenance we ask you
to burn 6 000 per day
it is almost impossible to continue that
for a long time because the amount of
fatigue most of it is actually not sort
of physical fatigue it's psychological
by what's called a central governor
model when your brain realizes that
you're working your ass off it just
shuts the rest of your body down to try
to work you less
so if on paper you said okay i'm going
to do
10 times the cardio so i can burn 6000
calories a day the rest of the day
you're going to be like
oh i have to go to the microwave to get
food
where's my reaching stick you'll
literally feel like that if you've ever
been around a lot of ultra high level
athletes in an overreaching phase what
do you guys do in your overreaching week
if you follow like the
the custom training templates at rp like
week number five motherfucker you ain't
going anywhere you're like fuck this i
don't want to move because i have to do
way too much training in the training
room in the gym the rest of the time i'm
just fucking switching off it's almost
it is like subconscious to unconscious
so if you're trying to double your
output it is unbelievably hard to do
it's kind of like uh
you know theoretical physics the closer
you approach the speed of light the
heavier the object gets so like if
you're 0.9 the speed of light the object
that used to weigh like uh well let's
say like 10 ton spaceship now weighs
like
12 tons or some shit and then you're
0.99 the speed of light it weighs like
200 tons and your 0.99 speed light it
weighs almost infinity so you like the
same engines that pushed it to 0.9 the
speed of light have to push it to 0.99
except they're pushing an incrementally
heavier object you sort of never get
there that's a similar thing what
happens
overly dramatized of course with
ponzur's paradox the simple way to sum
that up is as you ask the body to do
more activity it just sucks more and
more dick at trying to do that much
activity and it just tells you to shut
it down it will shut it down unless
you're actively have a calorie tracker
on at all times and if you stick to your
calorie tracker at all times it's going
to be brutal and 50 times harder than
you thought because on paper like i'm
burning 3000 calories now i'm like uh i
can easily eat 5 000 calories like that
no problem so i should be able to easily
burn 5000 i'll just do that work that's
not how it works it gets ultra fucking
hard and most people quit
period
most people can't out cardio a bad diet
even if they had the willpower and if
they had the willpower it's just like
two weeks of them trying to burn on 6000
calories a day and then overreaching
overtraining hospital trade
if only it were so
all right that's the bad shit that's why
this approach is probably not a good
idea however there are some grains of
truth that can inform our approach to be
a little bit better in other ways if
we're going to make a logical approach
we can still take some some little gems
from here first one
at the margins
you can eat more food than you otherwise
would if you're more active
so if you normally burn 2 000 calories a
day you can change your lifestyle to
burn 2 500 per day
and thus without at all reducing your
food intake it's still 2000
you're now losing like a pound a week
amazing it can work like that if you go
to 3 000 it doesn't quite work that if
you go to 3 500 you're gonna fucking two
weeks later you're gonna be way too
tired to do anything so at the margins
or small amount
you can get away with eating more food
if you're willing to do more activity
but remember it's a small margin away
from your normal intake
second point
you can lose tons of weight and tons of
fat
by being of a very high activity level
so don't let ponzor's paradox really
trip you the fuck out you can have a
sustained higher level of activity than
normal substantially higher just not
exotic not extreme
especially if it's something you enjoy
that's a sustained part of your life
okay if you like go to kickboxing class
or you walk a bunch of you have like
eight dogs because nobody wants to be
your friend you walk fucking eight dogs
around
you love it it's a part of life you
don't even notice like oh shit i had
like 18 000 steps today amazing right
that it's totally possible to keep doing
that right
and
the best way to go about this if you're
already super high activity is if you
want to lose some fat just peel back the
junk on your diet a tiny bit be like all
right for the next eight
weeks i'm just going to have no junk
food only good stuff because it's hard
to eat as much good stuff as junk food
and i'm just going to be as active as
ever
that works really well
you can get massive changes while still
eating a ton people come over your house
you're eating like tons of fucking brown
rice and salmon and avocado and people
like the fuck i thought you were in a
fat last time you're like oh i am i love
it like what the hell you're eating a
shit load of food like yeah but i like
super active and also i don't eat like
10 cookies before i fall asleep because
that's what really makes people think
it can work
at the margins
and lastly
really really impactfully losing fat
while at a moderate high moderate to
high activity level not ultra high
that's too bad not moderate because we
can do better moderate high activity
level
and eating plenty if you lose fat in
that circumstance plenty means just
a bit of a deficit
it is likely one of the best possible
ways to lose fat why because it is very
sustainable you can sustain a high
output it's just really great for your
health it usually makes you happier if
you're like hey you want to go to the
beach you're like no it's going to do
too much work you're like yeah fuck yeah
i'll go to the beach and pop some kids
fucking
beach ball
guys that way that's called a beach ball
the big that's all it's called it's no
other special technical name i'm unaware
of
but remember guys i'm from russia
originally and in beach ball you know we
have our own term for that i'm just
kidding
i don't know if in communist russia they
manufactured anything that looked like a
beach ball because we had almost no
beaches and fun was not something we
prioritized in any case
you all was energy
pop kids beach ball throw kick sand in
his dad's face you know make sure dad's
not gonna beat you up
and you're good to go right so it's
super sustainable to be high active it's
actually less sustainable to be low
activity you're just like missing out on
life from being a fucking
recluse piece of shit all the time so
it's really super sustainable to
moderate high activity
if you're eating plenty you are way less
likely to encounter severe diet fatigue
severe diet fatigue can occur from way
too much activity even if you're eating
plenty but if it's just a bit more
activity than usual and you eat still
plenty you can lose lots of fat and
actually feel really really good huge
mistake people make is they their
activity goes down because they start to
you know get uh basically in a diet
constricted sort of hunger mode
and then once they do that
they bring their food down even more to
compensate and then they just sit at
home and shiver and do this and
everything sucks and the highest
possible diet fatigue is from doing shit
like that so if you have a high moderate
level of physical activity you cut your
food down just a bit you are you can be
super lean and be like fuck i'm not even
hungry i don't even want a rebound
amazing amazing amazing amazing and
it's way healthier than doing less
activity and weigh less food so if you
keep your food up and you keep your
activity way up that whole process of
first of all living like that and second
of all losing fat like that is just way
healthier for you psychologically and
physiologically so there's a lot of good
stuff here
how do we wrap all this up and how do we
view it together so what are the best
practices
first and this is really a big deal i i
want to put two finding points on it
diet always comes first
any attempt at a body composition
alteration
which doesn't at some point look at diet
is fucking stupid
no bodybuilder on stage today i'm
willing to say it's no bodybuilder
it's
doesn't watch their diet of course they
fucking watch their diet first thing
they watch
so if you hear someone say this i
remember your friend like yeah thinking
about dieting but i think we should eat
whatever or just like train more please
try to talk them out of that because
they're missing the biggest possible
piece of the puzzle that could fuck over
all the other pieces of the puzzle
and they're gonna be none the wiser
because they think oh yeah i'll just
train more not how it works so ignore
diet at your peril
number two
when you're trying to lose fat ideally
have your activity level in a moderate
to high range what does that mean it
means like 10 to 15 000 steps per day
for most people
that's a really good sweet spot it means
you know anything above 15 000 unless
you're weight or something you're used
to it it's going to fatigue the fuck out
of you at least for the first two weeks
anything below 10 000 feels totally fine
but you could be burning more fat
anything between 10 000 and 15 000 on
average and don't get too hung up on
these numbers feels like oh i i really
am kind of moving around a lot but it's
not bogging me down because it's not too
much it's that sort of maximum
sustainable amount of high energy output
and it fucking works so that's point
number two
get your activity to that level and then
when you modify your diet you'll only
have to change it a little bit you'll
get great results
when you're trying to lose weight
point number three
get in
get it done get out
this means that instead of being like
well just keep my diet the same and do
more activity and some time i'll lose
weight as well look for the next 12
weeks i'm eliminating all junk food
and i'm reducing my dietary fat so i'm
eating mostly carbs and like healthy
carbs and proteins and veggies and shit
like that
if you count it all up and it adds up to
the calories that's even better
if you do that is it going to suck yeah
it's going to suck a little bit you
don't want to live like that but with
dieting you're living like this you get
in
get your weight down
get out and now you live here
as opposed to being like well i'm not
looking for a permanent lifestyle change
or just eating a whole you know eating
whatever i want and doing a lot more
activity you're not going to survive
that
so when you're trying to lose weight
don't think of all i'll change this as
something that'll sustain me forever
that's not how weight loss works weight
loss works as you make a change you
alter and then you go back to a little
bit more of a normal lifestyle keeping
much of the activity and physical
resistance training and good dieting
practices in but having a few cookies
having a
some junk food here and there that's
sustainability so dieting big rule is
get in do it right get out don't be like
oh yeah like if i just increase my
physical activity whatever i'll be
leaning like a year or some shit you
could be lean in three months get in get
it done
because a year of anything is just gonna
wear on you and you're probably gonna
quit most people quit
and
yes
you can
move more
than otherwise and you can eat more both
at the margins right
but remember that controlling your
eating is much more powerful based on
what you do or don't eat you have a huge
range of calories you can modulate
whereas physical activity fuck it's just
a lot harder to modulate calories
especially if the food is high calorie
density like junk food just eliminating
it or reducing it has such an
easy ability
sounds like a fad sounds like an easy
ability to just really cut a bunch of
body fat off in weeks and weeks and
weeks and go right back to eating junk
food just a little less and then
maintaining
so yes in an ideal world you would just
not have to change your diet you could
do a little bit more activity and get
ultra lean the problem is it doesn't
work like that in most cases controlling
your diet very well staying at a high
level activity and only bringing your
diet down enough that it causes fat loss
is the best way to go folks let me know
what mistakes i made what i left out
see in the comments peace
you
