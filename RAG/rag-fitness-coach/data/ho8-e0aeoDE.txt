folks welcome to
the q and a it's dr james and dr mike
what's going on my man
james not only am i ready for q and a
i'm ready for t and a oh i'm always
ready for some tna
it's an excellent website called tna
flicks
i would recommend people look it up
it's full of adult content tna flicks
very nice well i have to admit i am
still buzzing i don't know if you caught
ufc
261 this last weekend but that was a
thing banger from
from the prelims all the way to the end
i hadn't been like
that amped about a sporting event for a
long time
yeah it was intense uh
uh chef jinka bullet valentina
her performance was one of the most
dominant ever against the challenger it
was insane it was like
why are we here what is going on it
looked like
just like um like when a newbie shows up
to like a practice and you just just
completely maul them
and just like it just was just like oh
damn
and it was funny too because like that
was the one area they thought andraj was
gonna have
the maybe not the upper hand but the you
know maybe a tactical advantage was the
grappling and valentina was just like
i'm just gonna beat you at this just so
everyone knows i'm the queen of
this division that's intense
had some sense great uh great uh game
theory move
like sports strategy move of just like
because literally in her interview and
josh was like we were literally
preparing only for a stand-up fight and
this was like really shocking
and it's kind of like yeah even if your
ground game is good if you just weren't
preparing for it at all it's kind of
like what
it's a shock then you had the opposite
problem with vidal and usman where uh
moss fidel was just waiting for the
takedown so much he neglected the
striking
right and then just took a straight one
down the middle and bang
out actually level of everyone else oh
no no what i thought was most impressive
did you catch the nominess fight
yeah dude the way she threw that kick
where she was just posturing it was like
going to be that that inside leg kick
because whaley was really heavy on that
front leg
yeah rose shows inside leg kick whaley
steps back because she sees it coming
and then rose just raises up and throws
it up top and just smacks her
i was like question mark kick or
whatever um no she just hit she just
showed like
low and went high the question mark
could usually kind of turn over and then
i see jared can do it he can show you
how to do that's really a neat uh but it
was just one of those like
half like a millisecond thing she makes
the decision and just
boom knockout that was like so
impressive it was oh riley was real
pissed
i know i know i would call that a mildly
only mildly controversial stoppage
because really i didn't think it was
controversial
way lee got rocked but
at the as soon as the ref pulled apart
her last hammer fist and pulled him
apart whaley literally just sprung
right back up and it was kind of like
she was already on the way up and it was
like
she wasn't really knocked out like
people have been rocked that bad and the
ref lets him go at it
but she did take a few undefended hammer
fists to the face
and that is like that's why i said only
mildly how many you say controversial i
would say that in a different universe
if they let it go
i could see whaley recovering completely
turtling up repositioning
and the fight continuing i think it was
a very good judging call
whaley can't really be pissed about that
but it was like
yeah you know did she knock her the
out completely
no but you don't have to be knocked out
completely for it to get a tko that's
the thing
right so totally totally yeah i'm still
buzzing that one was crazy
i also have some fun facts for psa for
dog owners i had a whole bunch of weird
 happen lately so i thought my dog
hammerfest had gotten marijuana toxicity
because she was all
wobbly and weird and we took her to the
emergency vet
and they were like yeah this is kind of
what it seems like she probably got into
some marijuana
and it turns out my doggie daycare lady
had the same thing happened to her dog
like two weeks ago so i was like okay
she probably got into whatever doggy
daycare lady had
at her house and she's gonna have you
know this marijuana toxicity and that
makes it look
like they're drunk and they can't they
can't move and they're just
uncoordinated and they just they can't
walk they can't go to the bathroom it's
just the whole thing
yeah it's it's sad um so they gave her
like the treatment
and they said keep an eye on her and see
what happens she doesn't get better for
like
this today what ends up being the fourth
day she's still like all up
so we go to the vet again different vet
their normal vet
turns out she had a tick she had tick
paralysis
and if it goes on for a long time uh it
can actually cause them to
stop breathing and die so folks if you
have
drunk wobbly dog be aware tick paralysis
is a thing
and and that's that's that's my bad
because i think we
we probably missed one of her um flea
and tick medication dates and
you know it happens and she's so fluffy
i couldn't that
i couldn't see a tick anywhere so if you
have a dog
and they look like they're drunk be
aware of ticks
did they find the tick they did and they
uh
they tested her blood and everything and
she's otherwise healthy and they said
yep
take paralysis and they said it you know
at our vet they said you know it happens
maybe like two times
a year at the most they even took a
video for educational purposes and asked
for permission
oh wow yeah cause it's rare um so but
yeah
it was a little bit of a scare there so
hopefully she'll she's getting better
now
she's just she's still sleeping she
should be better within 24 hours once
they remove the tick and then they give
like an anti because the tick releases
like a neurotoxin so it has to clear so
they give you like a little bit of
medicine and um
usually within 24 hours they bounce back
so right now she's taking odd
yeah crazy right
yeah so make sure you get your dogs to
tick medicine
all right questions
let's do it first up
is oh sorry
i just realized when i pulled it up so
we had there was like a hundred comments
about the
keck thing right remember last week we
were like what's up with the kek
so like a ton of people commented on
that and i wanna
i just wanna jump on this because
normally this would be my wheelhouse
right
so it's a world of warcraft thing and
i'm sure people are like james is nerdy
ass should have known that
well i played all the warcraft games
except for world of warcraft and this is
going to be contentious
for you warcraft people but i
played everquest 2
and d and d online those were my mmorpgs
i never got into wow so that's why i
went over my head missed it
yep so i felt
i felt like i needed to address that
because everyone people jumped on that
apparently that was the most upvoted one
and a couple other people made the same
comment yeah
that's uh went over my head that's for
goddamn sure
[Music]
all right first up is kade howell's
first
question oh he's got two two high
rollers
yeah but we're not gonna answer the
second one because that is we have a
whole video series on that uh
uh he says what's the difference between
progressing through a med cycle
conservatively over the course of five
to six weeks
versus a shorter three to four week
muscle cycle with more aggressive load
last
run progressions are beginners best off
training conservatively in terms of
proximity to failure whereas advanced
folks need to be a bit more on the
aggressive side i would say no
so two things one is at the end of the
day progressions need to be decided as
much of an autoregulated manner as
possible
so if you're hitting the rir and at
or just above the reps that you need
your weight progression is good
if it's too easy and you're hitting too
many reps and you don't want to add that
many reps then
you need to progress faster in load if
you are progressing so fast and low that
you
can't can't hang on to your irs or even
your reps at all then you're progressing
too fast
they're uh you know volume progression
same idea
like you can say you know if i'm not
getting any pumps or any soreness or
whatever i probably should add volume
and there's not really a whole lot of
wiggle room on that
and if you're like just barely
recovering from like your monday workout
to your thursday one
and you get a mondo cycle pumps and
super crazy everything then adding any
volume there is just a real stupid idea
that doesn't make any goddamn sense
now within those uh auto regular
progressions of relative effort
and volume there is wiggle room
there is a wiggle room what we would say
is
if you're on a maintenance phase or not
changing body weight
then the middle of that range is best if
you're in a massing phase
start out conservatively but it's okay
especially later towards the end of the
meso to get a little bit aggressive
within reasons still within the
autoregulated paradigm
because on massing pushing forward and
ahead is really good and your body can
take it
and i'm cutting i would recommend going
on the lower one-third of that
algorithm and if you guys have the
hypertrophy book the scientific
principles of my perfect training
which they have a whole chart about what
how you should be adding sets in rr
and there's pluses and minuses in there
it's like add one to two sets
right so you would like add one set if
you were cutting add two sets if you
were massing something like that it's
not a strict rule
but like you can go a little bit more
aggressive when you're massing you can
always go conservative there's pretty
much no downside of that
but if you want to go a little bit
aggressive on massing is cool and
cutting is probably not a good idea
and that's probably how i would see that
and beginner advanced i think
beginners they should be progressing
actually we've had multiple videos on
this and it's in the book
should progress only on technique uh and
not on actually anything else so if your
technique is stellar
you progress uh if your technique is not
stellar you do not progress it doesn't
matter how
the aggressive not aggressive so on and
so forth so uh that's
that's kind of the deal with that i
think yeah really good thorough answer
there and just just to kind of reiterate
something that mike is saying like you
you make these decisions based off needs
right you don't just make them
arbitrarily and say well i'm going to
take a moderate progression
on this one the reality is it's like how
long do you need to go for
in order to hit whatever landmarks that
you're hitting so in the case of
beginners you're mostly focusing on
making sure they have good technique
maybe increasing some load as they have
demonstrated excellent technique over
time
and that might allow them to train you
know like a
10 week meza cycle it's very feasible if
that is is gonna happen
whereas somebody who is more
intermediate probably is not going to do
that now is that just something as cut
and dry as like okay well training age
dictates the length
no it just happens to coincide with
those things that uh that trait that
results
that are as a result of your training
age in terms of how strong you are your
recovery needs
your volume landmark needs etc so again
like
the reason why mike says these things
are individualized not a regulator is
because you don't just have a
one-size-fits-all approach to
things like progressions and you know
mesocycle lengths it's something that
you always address on the individual
basis
and sometimes don't make sense you might
have individuals who fall outside of
kind of the norm in terms of their
training age and their needs so you
always take it on the individual level
next up just scroll down is henrik
anderson our good friend
hold on this guy's this guy's talking
 about me over here
ever hear of a comb or a hat
rocky evans i'm assuming you're a man
and a man who is concerned about another
man combing their hair
needs to get a job or a career and focus
on something else there you go
masturbate more or less have some
ambitions other than criticizing my hair
all right uh henrik anderson says does
calorie distribution matter as long as a
macronutrient distribution is good
for example i consume about 25 to 30
percent of my calories in the first
two to three meals of the day for
adherence reasons while i consume the
rest of my calories in the remaining two
meals
this is both for training and rest days
uh i train in the evening so the
calories are clustered on my workouts
quarter metal hencefulness muscle
protein synthesis does not need carbs
and or fats to be stimulated that i
would disagree with that
oh yeah that's questionable there total
caloric yield of a meal absolutely
absolutely has an effect on how much
muscle you're gonna be growing out of
that meal you just eat a meal if you're
protein and you're in a deficit
almost all that protein just gets burned
up for energy it's nothing stimulated at
all
um therefore as long as i distribute
protein evenly doesn't matter yes
are any gains left on the table if i
distribute my calories as i explained no
because your
distribution doesn't seem to be insane
um and i think that you can make up a
lot of muscle growth you didn't have
earlier in the day by having more of it
um and as long as your protein is
distributed fairly even you're good to
go
i just wouldn't do anything crazy super
pulsatile like if you had like
20 or 15 or 10
of all of your calories total in the
first half of the day or the first
three quarters and you had one big-ass
meal at the end i think that's probably
like
slightly sub-optimal people try to do
 like that um
and also training in the evening and
then having a shitload of food before
you go to bed there's some pretty decent
research on modding now that circadian
rhythm lies that's not the greatest idea
might not lead to as much recovery good
sleep muscle
building and fat loss as potentially
having at least 50 50 split of food am
pm
maybe not anything more than like 40 a.m
60 p.m
at most in most cases and even better to
have maybe 60
percent in the morning 50 or 40 at night
i think it's probably a little better um
and it says does your answer change if i
was on a calorie deficit and a calorie
deficit it's less of a problem because
you don't eat so much that it interferes
much with your sleep in the evening and
actually that can be an advantage
because your nice little uh serotonin
doubt and you can get some good rest if
you a lot before you sleep so in a
calorie deficit
your method is not uh as big of a
trade-off as if you did it all the time
uh but i would say that trying to move
to a little bit more of an even
distribution
uh is probably going to be a slight
benefit in your case unless you're at a
deficit and then i think it all probably
washes out
james yeah and in this case and this is
like a question of like um
kind of optimality versus practicality
and in this case like
he he prefaces this question by saying i
do this for adherence reasons so i think
like
doing an imperfect program consistently
very often will
you know outweigh doing a perfect
program that you can't do consistently
so in this case like even if you don't
have the optimal spread
if this is something that allows you to
do it in a way that you can
you can do consistently and then make
changes that have impacts down the road
i think that's perfectly fine like could
you maybe have a slightly
different spread sure but if it's too
much fuss for you to maintain it on a
daily
you know daily basis then it's not worth
your time so i think it's fine i don't
think it's a huge deal
i am curious about um i mean i know what
menino is kind of getting at in terms of
like you can just have
protein and that does stimulate protein
synthesis but that is like
a very narrow scope of that issue you
know that
it does seem to be potentiated by
carbohydrate intake
and some other things so um but yeah
getting back to that i think i think
it's fine
the only thing i would say is like if
you're in a deficit and then you find
that like the the spacing in between
your meals
starts to become increasingly you know
painful for you
then you might consider changing it up
but if you can do it
keep going
next up is jeremy
all right
[Music]
hey guys quick question when tracking
progress slash performance
you in parentheses mike jesus
just to make sure that i'm excluded from
the case yes
often say to try to beat the reps from
the previous week do you think it really
matters if i try to be total rep
average reps percent or beat the reps on
every set compared to the previous week
this is a great question this actually
has a very easy answer
the average is absolutely the correct
answer because you can have some sets
where you underperform sunsets for your
form but if the same number of sets was
done and the average number of
repetitions at the same load
is higher or the repetitions are the
same but the load is higher or some
combination of the two
you're golden now i don't want
to say that the answer is total rep
it can be total rep if the same number
of sets are done but then the total wrap
and the average give you the exact same
parameter
if you just say total rep that's a bad
deal because you can actually be getting
weaker over time
just adding more and more sets to make
up for the fact that you're weaker you
sure as hell get a
similar amount of stimulus each time but
then you can no longer use your
progression system for tracking it's
just that application of stimulus so you
could be like oh man i used to be able
to get this in 10 reps and now i'm doing
it sets a five like that's not good
that's a good you need to deload before
way before that happens that's why total
rep is the best answer average reps is
and beat the reps on every set uh is is
not required because
some sets are good some sets are bad i
would say the goal should be to beat the
reps like by one on every set
but if you have a bad set one you know
one set and then you can make it up
forward on the next one that's totally
fine
that's totally that's totally cool i
think james yeah i absolutely agree and
actually i just had a client
who um this was their first time doing a
mass
after like a really long time of like um
progressive weight loss right so it was
like very exciting like okay it's mass
time right
and this person no surprise was making
like
really really rapid gains in strength um
and so it was becoming increasingly
difficult
for them to gauge rir and one of the
problems that they ran into was they
had this like hard hard-line goal to
beat reps on every set uh
every single exercise every single
session
and what ended up happening was uh this
person like prematurely overreached on
several exercises as a result of like
having to recalibrate with the new
gains that they were making and having
this hard set rule of like beat
every time so like it's kind of like a a
soft goal right it's not a hard goal
like yeah if you can beat
every time while still within the
constraints of your r
that's great but if you're just dead set
on beating reps every time
and throwing rir out the window and
things like that then you're going to
set yourself up for these unfortunate
kind of overreaching situations so
you know i think it's it's an okay soft
rule it's just as long as you don't take
it as a hard rule of like always have to
win because then
at some point you're going to hit a
plateau and then you start going down
right there's no
at some point there's nowhere else to go
i thought
i saw a really great movie recently
called hard rules
oh was that was that on tna flicks maybe
what if it was much better than the uh
than the first one soft rules
oh that's interesting that was a
frustrating one
tough to film all right
uh next up is a little scroll down
forest
nash fitness on the way down here
michael concepcion says we need to watch
neon genesis who do you
think you're talking to
who do you think you're talking to of
course i've seen neon genesis
that one my own way blew me away
it's for those of you who haven't
watched it it's it's it's an anime um
but it's like a really
deep one and so you watch the fir you
watch the show
right and it's like wow that was crazy
and you have to kind of think on it for
a minute and then you watch the movie
which is meant to wrap up the show
and it's just it's it's bananas i'm
hoping to watch the remake they just
released the last of the
remake films in japan so hoping to see
them
what was the guy's name forrest
something fitness there he is
hey docs firstly i just want to say
thank you so much for all that you do
i've been following recommendations for
the past year plus
and doing so has absolutely
revolutionized my training and the way i
coach my clients very cool for us star
pleasure awesome glad to hear
my question is about loading ranges for
the sldl and good morning i have been
training for years but only started
doing these exercises properly last year
i'm relatively tall six foot one
weighing 185 centimeters
i have long femurs relative to my torso
perhaps
my world yeah not my world
uh that's the opposite of my world
perhaps it is because of my
anthropometry
but i find that i can get very sore from
slds and gms with very light weights
for example three sets of 10 to 15 with
35 kilograms of the good morning gets me
sore for two or three days i feel a lot
attention to my hamstrings deep painful
stretch during each set but because the
weight is so light i feel like i
never truly get close to failure i have
the sensation i can always do more
uh do one more rep however when i've
tried increasing the weight
significantly to get close to failure
i tend to feel it less on my hamstrings
and more my lower back i know that my
muscle connection doesn't everything but
it does seem like sfr on these
experiences is better for me with
lighter weights forrest you're doing an
amazing thing of answering your own
questions
using interesting and not a dig this is
a good thing
using a perceived stretch less tension
doms as a proxy for stimulus and of
course lighter weight equals less
fatigue
my current strategy is increasing the
weights very gradually while continuing
to practice technique
but i'm just wondering my lack
approximator to failure in the meantime
is a problem
and if so what should i do about it many
thanks in advance for your advice you
can provide for us you're doing
absolutely the right thing please
continue to train in exactly the
training range you have
and add five to ten pounds every now and
again to it and eventually that light
will be pretty heavy but never give up
the technique
uh that lets you hit your hamstrings and
get them nice and sore over a few sets
because then you're absolutely doing the
right thing
that this is where one of those like
tension is everything and you gotta
do progressive progressive progressive
and mind muscle is for
 piece of and insert you
know homosexuality reference here kind
of thing
like people say like that and then
you watch them do
something and you're like so you feel
that in your hands like oh no man i feel
it everywhere like sweet you're a
 idiot so
if you're getting reliable
exercise after exercise
um session after session week after week
month after month soreness
doing something man you know 99 problems
with stimulus is not one of them
on the other hand if you're using real
big weights and you're like i don't
really know if my hamstrings are doing
anything
my back is tired that's really just much
more of the wrong answer
if you came out with a completely
different question and you said hey guys
like
i normally train heavy and but i feel it
mostly in my back and i don't really
know what's going on with my hands but
sometimes i try light and it feels
amazing but i don't want to give up
heavy
it would be more difficult for us to try
to convince you to stop going heavy
uh but you're already doing the right
thing so rock on james
yeah i absolutely agree with dr mike
here you are on the right track now i
will say
the good morning i think is a really
good illustration of this problem where
um i feel like with the sldo it's kind
of with that one as long as you are
conscious of your your back posture if
there's not much
room for fudging it outside of just
rounding your back and doing a shitty
sldo but if you're conscious of that
you know either that you either you can
pick it up or you kind of can't uh
whereas look with the good morning i
feel you on that you can kind of schmidt
around a little bit more and just kind
of oof it up with your back and
your knees a little yeah bend your knees
a little and kind of there's a lot more
um opportunities for those types of
errors so the good news here is that
you are working in a range which is
getting you sore right and
hitting the muscle that you're trying to
target what i would say is since you are
relatively new to these exercises so we
could effectively call you you know
not to be condescending in any way but
we say you're a beginner on these
movements which is fine
what you will find is that the
supporting musculature will
start to build up as well over time so
what you will find is that
for now you're doing sets of 10 to 15
before you really start feeling it in
your back well at some point
your back your glutes and all these
other muscles are going to start getting
stronger just as a result of you doing
that particular movement
and then what you'll find is that they
stop being as much of a limiting factor
or as much of a contributing factor in
this case
um when you are doing the movement just
because you're just building up
everything that goes into that sldl or
that good morning
and what you'll find is that sooner or
later you won't feel like you have to
oof it up with your back
or as much anymore and you'll probably
start moving into heavier weights as you
have trained this movement we'll say for
maybe
two or more years and what you'll find
is that you might actually start getting
better sfr maybe in the five to ten rep
range which is maybe
more kind of common for those faster
twitch muscles like the hamstrings
and you might be able to use those
heavier weights and maybe only need to
do like
one or two sets of let's say six to
eight reps on an sldl and then you're
done
so like for example like um i don't know
about you dr mike i can speak for myself
but if i did a set of 15
on good mornings or sldls i
might die it's it's there's a there's a
chance of death at that point it just
won't
it just doesn't work um and that's why
that would prevent me from continuing
before i could do that so for me the
heavier weights are actually better
yeah and my hamstrings would be so
utterly destroyed that i would not be
able to train hamstrings for
probably a month and i i'm embellishing
a little bit but you get the idea
and as that's just the result of
training age right in this case where
we've developed the muscles to to do
that and actually the best sfr tends to
be in a little bit of the heavier rep
range
but what you are doing as a beginner is
perfect because you're using light
weights
you're using good technique and you're
still getting a good stimulus on the
target muscle so
keep doing what you're doing and kind of
the what i just reiterating what i said
is over time what you'll find is that
you'll have less and less problems with
other muscles interfering like your
lower back for example
and you'll probably find that using
those heavier weights actually ends up
being better and better and better
as you tolerate it with that that same
good technique
yep yep yep yep
next up andrew atkisson
let's see there you are gotcha super
docs what are your thoughts on only
doing abs while cutting and i'm doing
massing
or doing all the time and benefits or
disadvantage just above you thanks
okay look the reason why i laughed right
it's just funny because
the first one only doing abs while
cutting so like
if there's kind of a conundrum with that
thought process right because when
you're cutting
you're not probably not going to be
growing any substantial amount of muscle
anyway so then you would ask like why
why train abs at all at that point
and that so i think with the abs
more often than not it's a question of
do you want to train abs
to potentially make them bigger if the
answer is yes
probably some amount of abs all the time
is a good idea
in terms of massing whether or not the
abs are a focal muscle group like if
you're doing any type of ab emphasis
that will determine how much that you're
doing
any other time is going to be
essentially like a maintenance level
amount of ab training so if you're
cutting or if you're on maintenance then
it's just basically like an mv or
slightly better
um for apps the question is like do you
want to train abs and that's that kind
of is the first
the first funnel right because you could
just not train abs at all and that's
fine too
yep agreed there's a slight addendum to
if you start training abs at the
beginning of your cut
just because they're so untrained they
might do some growth during sure
sure if you have a pop out and then
you'll be nice and then during the mass
you don't train them because you have
better things to do than train abs
but uh and that's just if you if you get
to the place at the end of your cut
where your abs are big enough
and you've been training them during the
cut then the answer is that's great
try not training them during the cut and
see if you still have awesome abs you
probably will
most bodybuilders don't train abs at all
uh and they got ripped abs i never
 trained my abs and i had a whole
six pack of veins and everything
because the fat loss is really what
causes abs stuff unless you have really
small abs you want it bigger
and then if you really have small abs
you want a bigger try really training
them like james said through the mass
and cut and then you'll really
get a chance to have much bigger abs and
then maybe you'll like that look better
yeah you could make a case that like
hitting an mv for abs regardless of how
frequently you train them throughout the
year
is essentially just stepping into the
weight room and training like you might
not actually have to do
a lot of direct work to hit an mv for
abs assuming you're doing some kind of
like
maybe dead lifting squatting any of
those types of movements you just train
your midsection so hard i have
i would have a hard time justifying
specific ab work if you really just
didn't want to train apps so that's kind
of what we said like just choose whether
you want to do it or not
yep
all right next up is
feasel the red z on my computer
or yup magenta whatever that is zachary
says you often talk
that any individual's mv mev mrv can be
higher lower than the volume landmarks
do we know if mv
any vmrv are normally distributed wait a
minute who
wait i gotta remember yeah no he meant
he's
they are the volume landmarks he means
as published in our various like our
recommended
ranges yeah okay yeah yeah so or guesses
as to where we think they are for most
people
uh do we know if they're normally
distributed we don't
i would bet all the money i have that
they are because complex biological
traits especially
traits that intersect not only with
genetics which is already
uh the highly pleiotropic uh and then
tons of lifestyle variables and
everything is almost all those end up
being
very very normally distributed so i've
got everything i have that all of them
are absolutely normally
distributed
um and that's that's that's a good bet
for almost every single biological trait
uh especially trait that has relatively
complex inputs it's just gonna be
 more distributed
so yeah so which is to say for those of
you folks that aren't super big on
statistics
that means that most people are within
some general uh you know
five to ten set a plus or minus from
what we recommended
and very few people are outliers but the
tails are pretty long
and then some people can have an mrv of
like 50 cents for mac per week and they
do everything right and everything rir
and those people absolutely exist
so some people say like man volume
lineups are i can do 50 sets
they just don't understand statistics
and understand that they're an outlier
um so when we say and they're probably
not an outlier either
they're probably not an outlier but they
can be an outlier too
right and then and then there's also
people that say like you know if you're
doing more than 20 sets a week or
anything you don't know how to train and
it's like that's
that's probably true for most people but
not true for all people uh so it's uh i
think that's the
word on that uh james you got anything
to add on that no
only what our our former mentor used to
say in that
you're special just like everyone else
it's like everyone else
all right next up is big c
sun big c sun got it
better better live up to that name son
yeah oh yeah
hey docs thanks for all the great work
you do how do you go about measuring
body fat percentage i've used
the navy calculator as well as height to
weight measurement chart
height to waist measurement chart i'm
just never positive if i'm actually
getting a good point
before bulk because when looking at a
picture of what 10 might look like
i can never tell if the people are
flexing or not they are they always
are let's just assume that from now on
or uh or not so it's difficult to use
the mirror
okay we'll resolve that a sec uh i know
people store body fender for me as well
yes
i'm 5 8 140 150 depending on leanness
i've often got waist measurement to
around
29.5 to 30 inches doesn't mean much of
anything because wastes are hugely
genetically determined some people just
have bigger wastes
bill kasmeier with zero percent body fat
will probably have a 45 inch waist
just because he's gigantic um
don't start with the strong man i
get too pumped yeah yeah sorry
i could see i could see abs slightly not
flexed and pretty well flexed
so here's the thing um it doesn't you
don't have to get to 10 to start
rebulking
you can start bulking 15 you can even
start it from 20. the only
logical thing of bucking is this is
three-point comparison one
get as lean as you like to see yourself
and like that's literally just up to you
point two is don't get sloppy fat with
 hanging off your body
okay like if you can't see your abs at
all flexing for most men that's probably
you're probably too fat
right and you probably don't like to get
that fat either so that's another answer
and part three is make sure the
difference between the first point the
second point gives a nice long
at least 16 week consecutive runway of
good
quality mass gaining so you don't pick a
point in which you're like all right
well the fattest i want to get
is shredded with no veins and the
leanest i want to get is shredded with
veins
and there's a three week period of
massing between those two and then i
have to recut
don't do that so make sure a nice
big difference between the two and you
can get as lean as a very very lean
as you know if you you know if you have
abs and veins you'd be totally fine
you'll regain just fine as long as you
don't have a weird
food disorder eating and you're not
waking up hungry in the middle of the
night then there's no such thing as too
lean
and then there's really no such thing as
too fat unless you're sloppy and your
health is bad
and number one is you don't like how you
look um you know uh you know in a
competitive bodybuilding
um way to answer this question there's
just one little proviso
is don't get so out of shape that makes
your next diet very hard
so don't go above you know pretty
decently clear abs when you flex
but for everyone else those those three
things i just said
start where you like where you think
you're nice and lean and where you like
where you're not too sloppy and then
anything in between just make sure you
have a nice long at least 16 week
consecutive runway with no mini cuts
between the two gaining it like half a
percent per week maximum
and then you're good to go james yeah
very good answer just to kind of
specifically answer the first part how
do you go about measuring body fat
percentage
uh big c we pretty much exclusively
don't
and even with my clients i you know i
used to
entertain when they would go get uh you
know what's it called the
accent dexa but there's the other one
they like the inbody
not botpod like the in body or some
whatever it is the uh bia thing
uh oh yeah baa that sucks yeah um
anyway so what i have found and my
opinion has changed on this over the
last couple years
is that i tend to find that doing those
actual body composition measurements
whether it's decks or
pick pick you choose whichever one you
want uh i find that it does more harm
than good
it just this is just riddled with so
much error
even if you do it under relatively
consistent conditions it still has like
incredible amounts of variation in error
between measurements and it just causes
people to go
insane and make just totally outlandish
decisions
so i think using the more subjective
measures that dr mike outlined in this
case
is actually better than what we would
call the objective measures which would
be like
getting a dexa or skin folds or bod pod
or bi
any of those things normally as
scientists we would say
you want to lean more heavily on the
objective but
at this point they're just so not
reliable
or actually we should say not accurate
and not sufficiently reliable to make
meaningful decisions that i think the
subjective
is probably your best bet and if you
want to have a more objective measure
just use your body weight
and that seems to be just fine so i know
that sounds kind of
you know antithetical to what a
scientist would say but we're just not
there with the body composition
measurements that you can do so i don't
don't waste your time mike and i don't
do it outside of maybe just for shits
and giggles and we certainly don't
require our clients to do it yep
yep all right
i was thinking chi like um you know
yeah yeah internal energy cheap but oku
type
all right michael chi says hi docs i'm a
few weeks into my mezzo and while
performance match slash speed is still
generally improving
i find myself systemically or mentally
fatigued two-thirds
through the workout such that i just
don't feel like pushing through with the
last third of the session
for example if i plan to do six
exercises in the session the first
four great but by the end of that i'm
ready to quit rather than finish up the
last two exercises
do you have any recommendations deal
recovery you have to grind out etc grind
it out because if your performance isn't
falling
then you're not actually you know you're
fatigued but not fatigued enough to
interfere with much of anything
so until your performance continues to
be matched or beaten you do not deload
when your performance becomes smashed or
beaten you can do
recovery half week or deload or whatever
is best based on a variety of other
questions we'd ask you for that scenario
so uh yeah i'd say grind along
training's supposed to be hard you're
not always supposed to feel good about
it
james yeah so i agree and i'll just add
one more on that is that um
if you haven't if you have some
flexibility in your training frequency
per week
maybe consider adding another day and
that way you can have whatever those
whatever those exercises that tend to
get put on the back burner they can have
their own day where you're maybe not
quite as fatigued
uh you know two thirds of the way
through the session i know maybe you
already have your frequency laid out in
the most optimal way and in that case
grind it out and maybe even consider
removing some of those exercises if it's
causing you to systemically like
overreach prematurely
if not as mike said like it's hard to
justify
uh doing fatigue management measures
when your performance is going up or at
least staying the same so
at that point you just gotta bite down
and and do it what's uh what did what
did david
our friend david used to say ain't
nothing to it but to do it
um all right
next up is brown b blair
monkman got it blaire
asks can we have a breakdown of linear
periodization general benefits and
disadvantages versus conjugate and dup
so for that i would refer you to an
article
that greg knuckles and i co-authored
actually two articles we co-authored
for juggernaut training back in i think
2015 and they still hold true
uh i think the article something the
title is like there is
only one kind of periodization and so
linearity and variation which is what
conjugate is
and dup which is very conjugate as
variation in either training systems
uh or rep ranges or exercise goals
dup is variation in volume and or
intensity under
uh relative effort you know these things
all appear in a program every good
program has an element of linearity for
example
if you have a conjugate program which
doesn't get harder over time your
program is stupid it doesn't
work
so you could look at a conjugate program
over several weeks or months and say
well it's getting harder over time kind
of like a
dude in a line isn't that linear but i
guess correct right
but also if you linearly increase
everything every session then every
single workout would have to be harder
than the last
including workouts with unrelated muscle
groups that would be kind of insane
so pure linearity is really
stupid fatigue management alone makes
that not a good idea
variation makes it another not a good
idea so every program has some conjugate
elements to it
uh or some dup elements to it we're
basically variation of some sort
introduced to either upkeep various
fitness quantities you don't want to
decline
simultaneously push two fitness
quantities in a known trade-off with
each other
uh or manage fatigue uh so
every linear you know every program is
based as a linear idea of we're starting
from worse and we're going better
and then because of the demands of
variation and the benefits
in it the demands of keeping up certain
qualities and the demands of fatigue
management
you're going to have some what's called
positivity in the program it's going to
go up and down up and down there's going
to be some different exercises chosen
some different energy systems trained in
various fractions so then
periodization is just actually called
one thing now it's just called modern
periodization
so what james and i were taught in
school we actually got literally our
phds in this
uh and we don't say linear periodization
versus
uh conjugate or gp leader periodization
some other problems with it's not really
periodization it's linear progression
uh that's just a a mild just real
pedantic
notion but it's it's more than that
actually i mean
you nailed it on you nailed it on the
head so linear periodization is not a
thing linear periodization is like the
exercise science bastardization of
modern periodization
this is where you have when you have
exercise scientists looking at sports
stuff in a lab and they have no
clue what sport training is
let's test it with undergrads that don't
know how to lift right and that's then
this
might sound like um like uh what am i
trying to say like
like like you're at your sport physical
your sport physiologist what do you mean
exercise physiology there's a big
difference right
if you say linear periodization to any
sport physiologist they're going to
like shake their head at you and be like
there is no such thing as that that is
not a thing
periodization is inherently non-linear
what you are talking about is what mike
just said which is like a linear
progression right which
even in that case like nothing can
progress linearly indefinitely so
all forms of periodization and
progression are inherently non-linear so
it's just one of these weird things
i hate that it's it's just out there and
it's because you have
unfortunately you have like people in
exercise science and exercise physiology
who
dubbed the term not really understanding
what they're talking about i mean really
what it comes down to is periodization
is just the
systematic sequencing of your training
variables to meet some predetermined
goal at some predetermined time
that's really what periodization boils
down to in a nutshell and it includes
all all those elements of things that
mike already said right there's
there's an inherent non-linearity to it
there's auto-regulation like there's
pre-planning there's all sorts of stuff
that goes into it it's just silly to
think that like there's these different
methods of periodization
when the reality is you just have like
intelligent training that is meant to
systematically get you to where you want
to be
in the timeline that you want to get
there that's periodization yeah
let me find oh here we go a very related
question which we'll just answer now as
well
uh ronald suarez if you want to
you probably have to just type this in
james because he's out
suarez very spicy
oh god damn it
similar question so he says for
bodybuilding to use any other
periodization models
like block linear undulating conjugate
are those more for performance athletes
so there they are no longer there's just
only
there's only modern periodization which
uses
linear elements block elements
undulations and the
atten the attention to multiple fitness
characteristics at the same time
which is conjugate uh you know like they
used to be called different methods of
periodization or methods
and that's really just not a thing uh
because you know you go to louise
simmons himself
and they say what kind of appetization
model uses he's a conjugate
you pull out his you know record of his
lifting or whatever one of his lifters
for last
you know six months and it looks like on
all the exercises the weights are going
up over time be like
looks linear to me louis he might not
have anything to say about that
um and you know you you would you would
you would go long and far
in actual sport practice uh with
strength finishing coaches that know
things
to find a purely linear model uh applied
to an athlete
like we just would have five pounds we
just always add five pounds but no
deloads
no no sometimes out of regulation like
that not none of that you only train one
fitness quality at a time like yep
that's it just add five thousand pounds
like
that's nonsense and you know we're not
gonna justify that with calling it a
model
that's a notion you know it's literally
a notion of an idea someone thought is
true but didn't put it properly to
actually test
so uh yeah so yes we in bodybuilding use
what's called modern periodization and
our entire book
scientific principles of hybrid training
literally explains that whole thing and
how to apply it
so uh give that a shot and i think you
might really like it
so i'm not trying to beat this horse
dead but like again if you ask this
question to
sports scientist sport physiologist
you're gonna get that same head shake
and we say like there's no such
periodization models don't exist
what what you are referring to is what
we call
evidence-based practice that's what
periodization is right
we're saying are you doing things to get
you are your athletes or yourself
to where you want to go in the timeline
that you want to do using
like the scientific resources available
as well as your own data collections and
anecdotes and putting all those together
that's evidence-based practice that's
periodization
there's no like this model that model
that's all just like craziness
that it's made its way into kind of like
the mainstream
terminology but it just it's meaningless
that's the thing so if you when and i'm
not i'm not trying to bash any of you
guys asking this question
what i'm just trying to illustrate is
like these things are meaningless and
they're just meant to be
like to get you to look up louis simmons
articles and stuff like that really what
you want to find out is like
what is evidence-based practice what are
the modern ways
of altering your training over time to
get what you want that's periodization
periodization is synonymous with
evidence-based practice
it's not synonymous with like these
other silly models and like conjugate
methods and all this
yep yep
last one for the day coming up is james
just put this in your find because
there's no way you're gonna find it
all right c-h-i-l-u
oh yes oh thai chili coorie
god damn psy says my understanding of
dynamic double progression
is that you try to hit some rep target
and if it is hit then you can increase
load
there are typically three methods of
testing this rep target that i'm aware
of
first is uh first method is first set as
many reps as possible
second method is last set as many reps
possible third is some rep target on
every working set that is not
necessarily our b10
which method do you recommend three by a
long shot i'll tell you why
biggest problem with first set amrap is
that that is hard as and if
you do it every day in your training or
every week
then you just the stimulus fatigue ratio
sucks last night mrap is tough because
you're not
regulating for how many sets you did
before in a good progression system you
volume will be
variable week to week and you look after
five sets versus after three sets you
get a different number of reps and it
doesn't necessarily mean you're weak or
stronger
and then number three is some rep target
another working set you should already
have
not necessarily our p10 which you should
already be doing and then towards the
end of a progression towards the end of
a mesocycle if you
really start to leave your rep range
behind and of all the sets or
at least first few then you know to
either increase that load now
or wait until the next message cycle to
increase the load and do another run
progression
so that would be my best answer james
yeah and so
like don't i can understand why
something like a if you if you see
like dynamic double progression
like that sounds cool right but it's
getting you to
like focus on things that are maybe
superfluous or just
not like so if let's just say you picked
option one to me the first thing
aside from the like just being very
fatiguing and hard is like that's your
injury risk is gonna be through the roof
you're making a max f a max effort when
you're the most
fresh like on everything that you every
exercise
every session that's nuts that's a
that's a recipe for getting hurt i'm
telling you
um last set it's just meaningless at
that point you have no idea
um so yeah i mean like it's uh what i
guess what i'm trying to say is like
if if you said hey dr james dr mike
what's dynamic double progression i'd be
like that's just some some guy made
up
i have no idea what that is like
literally that's just not it's just
literally like
if i was like hey have you used like the
dildo rir
conversion and they'd be like well
doctor james said dildo rio convert it's
just
means nothing it's just some i made
up right so just keep that in mind i'm
not criticizing you
like mrv
but anyways all i'm saying here is like
just don't um i don't know
don't buy into like hype and like you
know yeah yeah no
that also like struck me as like i just
wanted to answer it gingerly and be like
yeah like look like you can
there's a right way to do this this
system but uh
you know at the end of the day it's fine
way to do things but there's costs and
benefits and
it's just it's kind of like naming
things when they just
exist in a more grand architecture of
total understanding and you could be
using all of it
it's like it's like if you have options
to have like mashed potatoes rice
beans or pasta and you have options of
meat like you know chicken
fish steak etc and three veggies you
could say like hey are you using
you know are you using the chicken rice
method or the pasta steak method
right like there's all kinds of
different options there actually you
combine and
they all have their ups and uh ups and
uh and downs
so it's it's the same thing as conjugate
versus linear versus like block this and
that like you should be using kind of
all of them
in there in their moderation so is
dynamic double progression or whatever
refine system to use totally but there's
other stuff you could be missing like
altering loads uh predictably or
proactively altering loads that can be
really cool but yeah to your to answer
your question
not only is this probably the best
number three is the best way to use
dynamic double progression
but if you use any other system of
progression number three is a good way
to go about it uh
doing amraps all the time it's just
really fun when you're a beginner
intermediate
um and when you necessarily don't really
know even how to train hard but when you
start really understanding a trained
heart and you're really really strong
and you get a couple bumps and bruises
along the way the am raps start to seem
like a real stupid idea uh
unless you do them like maybe once a
month or something yeah
that's that's like the funny thing where
it's like you don't have to do amraps at
all like you could just not do it and
so like sometimes these hot words or
like you know little trendy fad things
automatically pigeonhole you into this
idea of like should i be doing amraps
it's like you don't have to do that at
all
if you just have like a fundamental
understanding of some basic things like
the scientific principles of training
i understanding you know basics of
training volume frequency intensity
things like that then you can kind of
throw that stuff
out the window and say like why am i
pigeonholing myself into this weird
system that i don't need
yep yep 100 that's actually true for a
lot of different sciences
um like it used to be like there was
this thing called evolutionary
psychology
uh it's just psychology yeah it's like
unless you don't
believe our brain and mental capacity
has evolved then
what the is wrong with you uh in
economics there's
uh you know are you a classical
economist a liberal economist are you
keynesian
are you an austrian economist it's like
well it's just modern field of economics
and all those schools had
a lot of good stuff to say even marxian
economics are some really excellent
insights that you can use
in moderation in a very specific context
that are absolutely spot on you know
so it's one of those things where
there's naming things it's cool and
it's really great to do that eventually
you have to learn the underlying
principles of what's going on
and then you don't so much need as many
names as you need names for specific
concepts
as opposed to specific methods so uh so
that's the deal
um i absolutely agree there hey mike uh
economics triggered me
you're a bjorn lomberg fan are you not
huge huge baron longboard fan
so i just read his like one of his more
recent books um i think it was which one
uh it was i read i read cool it but i
think the new one is false alarm
um yeah that was really good but anyways
um the reason that came up was because
he was on jp's podcast and they had
they had interesting talk so check that
out if you uh if you have some free time
i love what i posted your longboard
reference on my facebook every now and
again i used to
and like psycho leftists come out of the
woodwork and they're like he's wrong
he's an idiot
he's dumb and i'm like okay can you
explain to me logically why he's wrong
and they just never can
they're like okay you're misinterpreting
the data and you're like like which data
specifically using ipcc models
exclusively
and they're like he's just not crazy he
doesn't think the world is gonna end
tomorrow but he's just really reasonable
uses trade-offs
as the only person asking what proposals
cost versus just what they propose to
benefit
and it's just like dude if you disagree
with your line board if the margin is
great
but as a look of the major philosophical
disagreement you're not a logical person
there's
not much else to say so there was like a
really funny point in their podcast so
like what jp was saying was like so
you're presenting this like
model of saying like can we can we
measure like the input outputs
economically of all these decisions
and um he's like you know there's some
flaws in that thinking but he's like
here's the thing
if you want to criticize that particular
analysis
you got to come up with something better
and jp spent like the good part of like
an hour
trying to critique that like like a
really hard nose like okay i'm trying to
pick apart
what you're the way that you're trying
to describe these decisions and he
literally was just like i really can't
think of anything better so the burden
is on you
to come up with something better if you
want to be a hater on it right and he
was just like
for now this is like the best that we
can come up with and uh and it was a
really interesting talk
well it's also like gee you know he
doesn't economically
and compassionately inputted cost
benefit analysis yeah it's like how do
you beat that
like what what else are you plugging
because basically just for those of you
who are not in the know and you can look
up john lobber he's got some great short
videos
a couple ted talks he's basically a guy
where like you know there's two
main camps that make the most noise in
global warming specifically he's written
a lot about other environmental issues
camp one is like hey man global warming
is a 5g
bill gates invention
white power and you're like i knew you
were i knew that was going with that
and then uh the other camp was like
we're gonna die greta thundberg
 let's de-industrialize and
everyone's gonna die the globe
warning starts tomorrow and we're gonna
 the earth is gonna burn out mel
gibson movie
and then in the middle is bjorn lomborg
somewhere between those two points
saying hey guys like man-made global
warming is almost certainly real
and it definitely has downsides that can
be measured in human cost and a variety
of other costs and economic costs
like if we want to fix them how much
will it cost to fix them and then let's
evaluate all these
policy proposals like the paris accords
the kyoto protocol
and see how much they're gonna fix
versus how much they cost
and a few of them it's like the total
expense of global warming over the next
hundred years is like
you know like something like 10 trillion
and some of these programs cost like
300 trillion and you're like explain to
me how that's a good idea
like we literally get the same benefit
for like in two orders of magnitude more
cost
and it's kind of like you know the
people that respond to that are never
like mathematically responding they're
usually like well you just don't think
the world is gonna end and he's
like no i think that's a low probability
event
like the international panel of climate
change continues to say
every single time so it's like it's like
a purely it's like an exercise scientist
talking to like a psycho gym bro or like
a hippie who thinks your
weights are going to kill you it's like
well you know let's look at the data and
let's look at the trade-offs and make a
logical decision
i mean bjorn longboard is just funny
because people try to paint him as like
a right-wing conspiracy that's
right he gets clumped in with them for
some reason yeah later he was living in
the united states
exclusively vote for the democratic
party he's from denmark and he's
openly gay
like boy oh boy that's a clan
member if i've ever seen one
so it's one of those like inconvenient
people talk about it giving you truth
it's inconvenient
for the psycho environmentalist left and
you know the
the the psycho right doesn't see him
because he admits that global warming is
probably man-made in large capacity and
that we should be doing something
reasonable about it and those people
like reasonable but
freedom man and then all of a sudden no
one's thinking so
check out jordan longboard he's
great and uh yeah if you guys want to
see some like funny
i say funny i don't mean them they are
funny though you get a laugh
well it's like it's it's yeah i i did
actually ha ha but that's cause i'm a
bad person but anyways um
there's so on cool it and in false alarm
there the two that really struck me
was when he talked about the deaths of
polar bears and like i don't want to
spoil that that part was like
hilarious
and you'll see why if you read it and
then um the
um global warming effect on human deaths
which i don't want to spoil it
is also hilarious when you actually
read the uh statistics and stuff so um
anyways uh sorry for the tangent there
but uh
mike was talking about economics that
triggered yeah yeah no and like uh one
of the
also the awesome things bjorn lombard
does which is great in any field
and this is something that in our field
a couple of people stand out
is doing really really well metal
hanselman's does this really well in our
field and eric trexler and greg knuckles
do it really well
uh people just take certain things for
granted because people repeat them
enough and meno and eric and greg
often times on different sides of the
aisle but because is that really true
and they look into the data they're like
that's not true at all or they look into
it like oh yes that is true
um your number does that incredibly well
on a bunch of environmental issues and
global warming specifically
because a lot of times you hear in
the media is just designed because media
is just
for-profit entertainment every single
media company's for-profit entertainment
company
is trying to get you to watch and
they'll say that's not technically
wrong although it's just
wrong by omission and all of a sudden
you're not really getting the truth like
um you know many of you may be under the
under the uh understanding which
completely reasonable given media
exposure
that you know like um sort of stochastic
or really really hardcore
uh crazy weather events are increasing
in in volatility
and frequency and you know they're
really bad oh my gosh
i know where you're going with this yeah
oh my god jordan is like that's
interesting let's look at it
statistically if he looks at it he's
like this is not true
because some context in which it is true
in most contexts which is just not
and then at the end of the day you're
like like
it's like it's like if you had a story
about every shark attack uh
you know every year like an in-depth
like cnn nightly news one-hour special
all you would ever see is shark attack
stories you'd be like look like i know
the world's a up place but we
have an
epidemic of shark attack whereas like
the number of people
statistically that are dying of shark
attacks is falling all the time first of
all and second of all time
it's just like nothing it's like more
people die choking on toys they're not
even their children's toys that they try
to swallow the shark attacks
they're not even children it's like it's
totally insane so a lot of times when
you see stuff on media
and you feel this like energy from the
media and i mean this like in a in like
a real hippie way
like a negative energy of like you
should be really scared of this new
thing is what's hurting your children
tonight 11
you should always be really skeptical
and be like i wonder if that's really
true on the net balance
what the trend is is is it a problem
that used to be worse is declining is it
rather stable is it going up
is it even a problem at all and a lot of
times when you read books like
longboards and multiple other people
stephen pinker etc you realize like a
lot of the you hear in media
is not an outright lie but it's amazing
it mis paints the world
to some significant extent to seem more
bombastic and shocking
and yes and sometimes just not the case
you know it's like let's take the v
sorry real quick james and i'll shut up
mainstream media to scientific
understanding the world
is really a lot like no offense no
offense no one's gonna be offended it's
like the shreds is to exercise science
like like if that's where you learn your
science like my dad literally watches
all the ads on all our videos james my
dad watches all the ads
and he'll he'll message me he'd be like
hey this v shreds program is it good i'm
like
you can skip those come on amazing it's
amazing they've actually bought
supplements from this dr gundry guy
who like says your gut's going to kill
you they're we bought the supplements
i'm like
but like that's what you're getting
exercise science wise is like
that's that's the reality that's what
media is so just a quick teaser just on
the note dr mike was making about the
media so like one example is the media
will often report
storms and how much total damage in
terms of money that they
uh they elicited right and so one of the
funny like
just a funny thing in one of bjorn's
books i remember which one but he
basically looks at the historical data
on storms
and for the most part with a few
exceptions the number and intensity of
storms
over the last like couple hundred years
is about the same
it's just that humans keep moving into
more storm or fire prone areas and so
the more expensive
with more expensive so the damage
keeps going up over time and then the
news media will report that and saying
like
look at all the money that has been
spent on storm damages or wildfires or
all these things and it's like what
about fires
the incidences are the same more people
just live in wildfire areas now
do you guys remember the california
wildfire crisis straight up never
happened
california's had statistically almost
identical wildfires for the last hundred
 years
like they've had like weight like in the
past 200 300 years ago by the
archaeological record or whatever
california wildfires that make today's
fires look like nothing like
 cataclysmic it's just
 california it's just now people
live in the middle of nowhere
they have a little house
and the fire predictably comes every
 year they're like oh no our
possessions and it's like
right on man like if you ever see
housing in miami
you're like your house is at sea level
and they're like yep like what's gonna
happen next hurricane comes like
i'm gonna be interviewed on cnn and say
how this is a tragedy and you're like
so it is so it is yeah so check uh
there was a we should get we should get
some kickbacks here for plugging bjorn
uh welcome bjorn
yeah yeah check back check that out uh
he also has his on
audios which is how i list
all right do how we do on questions are
we done we're done we've been done we
actually hit 11 today because then we
have those two periodization questions
and i want to make sure we sort of like
set the record straight on that
ah okay well let's do a little little
housekeeping and we'll close out so
somebody asked on i didn't address it
while we were on this but somebody asked
about the the law enforcement thing i
was working on
i uh just broke the ice on that so
you know like when if you have tried
writing before usually you sit on an
idea
for maybe a year or two and you have all
these other ideas and you're like i know
how this is going to come out and you
just got to start
at some point and that's where i'm at
now so i just started so
that's going to be on the way probably
in a couple years uh
my book is still being worked on by mel
but charlie got the cover art done and i
think it looks really good i'm going
gonna send the figures off
to uh what's his name to get those
worked on so we're
on our way but it's gonna be a minute uh
dr mikey got anything
the guy from the philippines you mean
antonius is that his name yeah
yeah yeah yeah we have this guy who does
our
graphic design for rpe who lives in the
philippines
and he's on a completely different
reverse time schedule than we are so
like one of our people that's in charge
of this is like
antonius is like a magic production
machine he's a genie because we send him
things at 6 p.m
and then things not nonsense things that
should take like five days and that
the next morning at 8 a.m use your inbox
of all things completed and you're like
do you not sleep what time is your night
and how do you
do this so quick it's unbelievable
international international trade is
unbelievable
it's just hyper talented people just
everywhere in the world and like somehow
he works for us
and like you know we pay him what by
philippine standards is a
inordinate amount of money
which he more than deserves
because he's like he's a freak i
understand how he does nobody
understands how he doesn't
um it's gonna be really really
unpalatable when you realize he employs
is like
like a team of ten they changed children
to do the artwork
out of that one nike style it's like
it's not a sweatshop because they're all
like on
tablets with like you know it's air
conditioned but they can't leave
they're chained to the tablet jesus
christ
this this episode is ending we're just
spiraling here
i'll make it not as bad but uh you know
you know the artist banksy james
yes the the graffiti person yeah yeah so
like uh i've
in stephen pinker's book blank slate
there's a uh
they cite a couple of sources for this
uh opinions and one of them is like i
think you journalist named adam gopnik i
believe
and uh they talk about post-modern art
and they bring up banksy as one example
and like you know like banksy is
always like like a nuclear reactor and
the kid playing with sand in the
foreground
the gas mask on and like one of the
critiques i think by adam gotnik was
like
this is like uh wildly obvious
that's not controversial like
wait wait wait does this painting mean
pollution is bad it's like oh
like holy oh my god
so it's one of those like i could see
banksy making a thing where like we're
on our ipod or on our ipad but we're
like
handcuffed to it and it's like wait wait
wait hold on does this mean like the
ipad's addicting he's like yeah like
bro oh my god how did you know this and
how are you so able to put it in art
this is some high level
einstein banksy
those algorithms are literally made it
to be as like addicting as possible
folks they just you like feeding you
what you want
technology it's amazing it's amazing
except it's bad somehow
yeah all right dr mike any any up rp
