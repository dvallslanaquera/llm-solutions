welcome to the second video in this
series
now first of all i want to thank
everyone for their feedback
and for the likes the subscribing and
everything else
uh i really appreciate it it's been
a pleasant surprise uh to see how many
people were supporting
and yeah without further ado i'm gonna
try to address
some of the feedback from last video um
some people said the microphone
should be adjusted a little bit so i've
tried it out and some people said i
should try
different angles some people said i
should try
uh more vlog style content which i'll
get to eventually
for now i'll stick to just training
videos to get used to editing to get
used to
recording talking on camera that sort of
thing
so yeah without further ado here's the
training
uh so tuesday am basically pull
i started some chin ups there's
baseballs i did some curls
and some drugs i didn't record the last
two um
this week is three reps from reserve
so a bit closer to failing last week
and during a pretty harsh deficit like
this one
what i find is
i can't really increase strength much i
can maintain it fairly well
on most exercises i think typically the
exercises that see the biggest decrease
in strength
tend to be exercises like bench or
squats where the range of motion can
sometimes increase
during weight loss and where typically
getting weight
makes you stronger on them so if you
look at the correlation
for example between
weight class and dead not that lift
squat and bench strength
they're pretty closely correlated which
doesn't necessarily mean that gaining
weight
is going to help you but it does seem in
my experience and in a lot of athletes
experiences
like gaining weight is pretty helpful
for squatting and benching
but for stuff like that lifting where it
doesn't really change range of motion
that much
uh it doesn't really make much of a
difference for strength
so yeah for now during my cut i'm mostly
just aiming to maintain strength which
i'm doing fairly well
um moving on in this session
did some legs did some uh rdls
lettering some micros i do seated light
curls twice a week and lying lick curls
once a week
i think seated leg curls as i described
in last video are a little bit better
than limelight curls
as an exercise for hamstrings so
unless i've been doing seated light
curls for a very long time
and they grew quite stale i would
typically emphasize
seated leg curls a bit more than
line-like curls
then i moved on some hack squats i find
generally speaking i find like pressing
hack squatting and smith machine
squatting
and belt squats as well to be feasible
in the
10 to 20 rep range but one trick i find
very useful
is to breathe all throughout the
eccentric
until you reach the bottom of the wrap
so for example here you can see me
breathe until
a few inches before i reach astro grass
and then i take a big breath in and
brace for the concentric
and then exhale when with the top of the
wrap again
i find this helpful to make higher rep
sets
like the 10 20 rep range still product
for muscle growth
because if i just brace at the top and
hold my breath
through the whole rep i'll find i
failure because of my lungs a lot
earlier than failure because of my quads
and so doing that can help make higher
rep ranges productive for like pressing
half squatting smooth squatting
then for my am session on wednesday i
started off some incline benching
i'm using this machine for a few reasons
the first one is
i have a shoulder injury i injured my
shoulder ribby around a year ago
in a pretty gruesome home gym accident
where i was inclined benching and
the rack i was using just flipped and so
i had to throw the bar off of me
and in the process it was around 80
kilograms in the process
uh heard a loud
tearing noise in my left jeweler and uh
for six months to 12 months i had pretty
bad pain in the left shoulder
which i slowly was able to overcome but
it still means like on some exercises i
prefer having a bit more stability
just to avoid getting a range of motion
with my left shoulder
that i'm not comfortable with that's
also when on this exercise for example
you can see
my left and right shoulder arm quite
symmetrical that's nothing to worry
about probably for muscle growth
but it does reflect itself in some
exercises for technique uh likewise for
these
i typically find i'm a bit weaker on my
left side again
i think that's because to some extent i
wasn't able to train my left arm
shoulder as productively as my right one
for a while
um and i also avoided overhead
extensions for a while because
i wasn't able to do them pain-free um
but yeah now i'm slowly getting back
into it and i don't have much pain
anymore
so yeah i'm pretty happy about that so i
did some overhead extensions afterwards
and then i finished off through some
machine flies
it's my second time in like maybe ever
doing these and i'm a pretty big fan
i think they stretch out the chest
pretty well the machine allows for a
pretty good setup
and while you don't get as much peak
contraction range of motion
or shortened range of motion as you
would for a cable crossover
you do get a pretty long range of motion
and it feels like the stretch
is almost the hardest part of the range
of motion
and so because we know that training a
muscle group with longer lengths when
it's more stretched
is pretty good for muscle growth this
exercise i think is a pretty is a pretty
option
um so yeah i quite like it
i also found myself being surprisingly
strong on it
first time using it i was able to go up
to around 100 kilograms
and the stack goes up to 130. so yeah i
quite like the machine
i get a good pump from it a good stretch
and so
yeah i'd recommend you give it a shot
especially if
you've been using cable crossovers for a
while for example and you're not getting
much out of it anymore
then next session for my pm session i
started with some barbell rows
uh i'm using a plate to increase range
of motion slightly i find that otherwise
i don't get quite enough range of motion
i'm using a belt just to
make stabilizing my spine a bit easier
and then
i moved on to some pull downs
now personally i can start seeing some
more definition on my back
than i was until a few weeks ago
um i've lost around
seven kilograms in the past
six weeks ish seven weeks and so that
might be why
um here you can see me using straps just
making sure my forms aren't limiting
factor
and getting stretch then i moved on to
some other arrows
uh i can go surprisingly heavy on these
i i think i'm using 25 on each side
which should be around 55 60 kilograms
i'm not sure how the bar is
um again using straps just because it
allows for three reasons
it allows a bit more freedom as far as
wrist positioning goes because the
straps are
my anchor point to the bar and so i can
position my wrist a bit more comfortably
and two also because i want to make sure
my forearms aren't limiting factor
especially with bars like these where
the knurling and the grip isn't as good
i think using straps can be pretty
beneficial then i did some curls
i realized the angle here isn't ideal
but i didn't have my tripod on me
so so added some curls i
typically prefer a shoulder width grip
for most exercises because that tends to
maximize range of motion
and that applies to curls to an extent
as well i think if you take too narrow
grip
you typically don't reach for elbow
extension at the bottom
and too wider grip and people find
uncomfortable
then next session my am session for
thursday i started off some sumo squats
for me sumo squats are just a bit wider
stance than usual
so someone else's sumo squat might look
a lot different from mine
but that's just how my sumo squat looks
i probably should have set up the
safeties a bit lower here
i noticed on some reps most reps in fact
i sort of touched the safeties um which
made a bit unstable
then i moved on to an exercise that i
think is quite underrated for
muscle growth city squats
so the reason they're underrated is
training the quads
in the more lengthened position like you
would in
a here you can see me saying hello to a
friend
um in a squat at the bottom of the squat
or bottom leg press tends to produce
more muscle growth
and so having a lot of tension at the
bottom is likely a good thing
which you don't really get in my
extensions because leg extensions almost
always
aren't a full range of motion exercise
like you don't get a fully lengthened
quad like you would in a squat
and so i think having an isolation
exercise that trains the rectus femoris
for information the rectus femoris is
one of the four heads of the quadriceps
that also inserts at the hip which means
when you're squatting for example
because it also acts at the hip it can't
be very active
or get stimulated much from squatting
like the
same thing for like pressing same thing
for hack squatting and so leg extension
is training pretty well
uh because it's an isolation exercise
which means the rectus femoris is able
to
work pretty hard during light extensions
and the same applies to city squats
so because it's a full range of motion
exercise for the quads
it's a single joint so it's only using
the knees essentially
and because it puts a lot of tension in
the most stretched position of the quads
i think it's pretty underrated and i
think if you're strong enough to do them
in the
10 to 20 or 20 to 30 rep range it can be
quite beneficial
as a sort of isolation exercise for
higher repetitions um
so yeah i'd definitely consider using it
more often the
stability component can be a bit of an
issue if you have a cisco
machine which some people have access to
i think that can be a great option
then i moved on to some line light curls
again as i said
i do see it like throughout twice a week
like those once a week
next session for a pm session i trained
chest and triceps mostly
i started off some 30 degree incline
dumbbell pressing
i get some 45 degree
pressing in earlier in the week with a
smith machine close grip pressing you
saw me do and then i get
30 degree inclined lumbar pressing once
a week um
chest and arms are probably my weakest
body parts
and that's because when i started
training
i didn't really focus on them very much
i
preferred lower body training for a
variety of reasons
and i did some back training as well but
i didn't really focus on arm training or
chest training
that much i found it pretty
uncomfortable and so now
those two are probably my weakest body
parts
so if i when i begin doing
specialization training i'll likely be
focusing on chest and arm growth
for a while so then i moved on to some
cable crossovers which you can see me
right now
uh key points get a deep stretch and
also get that extra
range of motion by crossing your arms
over which you don't get in any other
exercise
um and so i think it's very beneficial
to do it here
the next exercise was preacher tricep
extensions
uh the reason i was including these
well the reasons i suppose are several
fold the first one was
it's a pretty stable exercise which for
dealing with my shoulder injury and
preventing sort of flare-ups
was pretty helpful i wasn't really able
to do many skull crushers at the time
because that was pretty
painful in my shoulder and this mimics a
skull crusher fairly closely
while being a lot more stable and wasn't
as painful my shoulder like the angle
your shoulder is at for example is
around 90 degrees
which is around the same it would be in
a school crusher and so i think if
you can't do scorecrush for some reason
then this can be a pretty good
alternative
uh as you can see on this machine you
can grind out pretty hard
and so well that might have looked like
oh that was complete failure
i actually had at least one or two more
reps of me um probably closer to three
i find that with preacher curls and
preacher tricep extensions
you can grind out reps a lot more than
on most exercises
then i did some calf raises on a leg
press machine
i'm usually not a huge fan of these i
personally get
a lot of foot pain when i do higher rep
calf raises
and so i find typically heavier calf
raises
or body weight calf raises whack out
better
i get less foot pain um
but yeah given that i'm able to do these
fairly heavily it was fine
i wouldn't go much above 15 reps
personally some people can go way higher
and be fine but personally i can't
so then for my saturday session i
started off some kale rose
neutral grip for back training because
your back is a pretty complicated
uh body part i suppose like there's a
lot of different muscle groups from
lower traps the mid traps
the rhomboids the upper traps the
lats teres major and so forth elevator
scapulae
that like you probably want to use a
variety of grips and a variety of angles
to make sure all of those muscle groups
get pretty good stimulation across the
week
and so for me you can see me using uh
neutral grip cable rows you can see me
doing overhand pull-downs
neutral pull-downs um
yeah you can see me using a variety of
grips then i moved on to some cable face
pulls
i did them once already this week
earlier in the week
um i think on tuesday but i did them for
heavier reps
whereas descending them for higher ups
um
i think typically putting
light to work after lighter work so for
example here on tuesday saw me do chin
ups
heavy chin-ups and then heavy face pulls
and today you saw me do
moderate rows and then moderate or
lighter face pulls
i think that makes sense um if i were to
do
heavier rows and then go to face pulls i
would feel quite fatigued for my face
pulls
and so even if i were to try and do
heavier wrap ranges like say the 10 15
rep range
it wouldn't be as heavy as would be
productive and so let's say you're
trying to get
a variety of intensities say from 30 to
85 percent of 100 max
then you might not be able to go quite
as heavy as you usually would if you did
higher rep work before face pulls and so
i think grouping together your heavier
work for back and delts for example
and then your more moderate work can
work pretty well to get a variety of
intensities
and we know that different intensities
so different weights
um say for example thirty percent versus
eighty percent of max
10 to stimulate muscle growth via
different pathways and so using a
variety of
intensities and rep ranges is probably
best for muscle growth overall
and so i think grouping those
intensities together can be pretty
helpful
now for this exercise i actually
unfortunately during my third set of
these my right director
got strained a bit it's a somewhat
recurrent injury
it feels like lower back strain though
i'm obviously not qualified to
self-diagnose
this same injury has happened a few
times in the past it typically occurs
during
fairly random exercises i've had it
happen while doing good mornings audios
squats shrugs and now curls usually
the bark is worse than the bite it's
quite painful during the first few hours
or days
but then recovers quite quickly
typically within a few days i'm able to
train
completely pain-free again in this case
i was supposed to do a lower body
session
for my pm session but instead i tried my
hardest not to freak out
slash catastrophize it since that's to
my knowledge
one of the worst things you can do when
you get injured
and instead i made some modifications to
work around it so instead of training
lower body i trained
uh chest and front delts and triceps so
you can see me in that session right now
i was supposed to do the session 24
hours later
but because i took a rest day on friday
i felt pretty fresh going into this one
and so i trained upper body fast
i decided instead to delay my lower body
session by 24 hours
so i was training legs on sunday in the
evening instead
so he saw me do some machine benching
some smith machine over pressing and now
some
cable push downs um if you've paid
attention to an extent to the rep ranges
i've been using
you should be able to notice that for
most body parts if not all body parts
i get a variety of replicasim as i
discussed earlier
getting a variety of intensities and rep
ranges probably produces more muscle
growth than sticking just to one rep
range
and if nothing else it is more fun um
always doing the same rep range can be
pretty tiring mentally it's just a bit
of
every session looking and feeling the
same whereas if you include a variety of
painters it can be a bit more
entertaining and more fun
so then i moved on to some unilateral
calf raises
uh you'll notice by contrast
for my calves i tend to stick to mostly
five to ten intensifier buck that's
because
individualization so for different
people you're going to have to
modify certain training principles
slightly so in my case for example
if i go above around 15 to 20 reps for
my calves i tend to get a lot of foot
pain and
that prevents me from going close to
failure
and getting good stimulus and so
sticking to mostly lower rep ranges and
heavier weights
helps out with that and allows me to get
a good cal stimulus for other people
that's probably not the case
and they should probably stick to
including all rep ranges so the 510 rep
range the 10 to 20 rep range
and the 20 to 30 yard range but for me
specifically as an individual
that's likely not the best choice and i
think doing mostly a heavy wrap work is
better
so then i started my sunday session in
the a.m with back
uh that was as planned and with some
pull downs
then i moved into some machine rows um
i can definitely notice myself getting a
bit leaner now like you can see some
hamstring separation
which is nice um
on these i was somewhat worried i would
get a lower back flare up
but i didn't i focused on keeping my
spine pretty
pretty static during this exercise um
i think some machines allow you to get a
full range of motion and to flex and
extend your spine
but on this one because i just don't get
enough range of motion
i can't actually do that and so i have
to stick to just moving my
elbows so to speak um
then i moved on to some dumbbell upright
rows
i personally like these a lot because
they allow a bit more freedom
on my wrists and shoulders as far as
moving each limb individually goes
which makes them a bit more comfortable
in my shoulders and wrists but then
other people might find that different
but i think on principle
dumbbell exercises tend to allow it more
freedom and so for most people
they can be more comfortable than
barbell or easy bar variations
so as you can see i go around
shoulder height and then come back down
then i moved on to some
incline dumbbell hammer curls if you
noticed earlier in the video
i was doing some incline curls as well
but that time same sort of principle as
with the face pulls where back then i
was doing
lighter work so i was doing 15 to 20 rep
walk whereas in this case i'm doing
10 15 rep rock um i think hammer curls
typically
allow themselves to be loaded a bit more
heavily and so i think
using heavier weights and using
typically heavy rep ranges
gives you a nice uh spectrum intensities
by having
pretty pretty heavy work from your
hammer curls and then
quite a bit lighter work from your
supinating curls for example which tend
to be a bit weaker
so that's one thing you could try and do
then i did some dumbbell wrist curls
uh fairly heavy and then finally for my
sunday pm session
uh going into this session i was feeling
a bit rough with my lower back
and so i replaced high bar squats three
times five by 10
and smith machine split squats for two
sets with just four sets of
split squats i personally find
split squats to be quite easy on the
spinal extensors aka lower back
and so i decided to move higher squats
from the session and focus on split
squats instead
split squats and squats target pretty
similar muscle groups
i find that split squats give me as much
if not more
stimulus and squats for my glutes at
least
thus i only added one set to my split
squats i also added one set to my leg
extensions as you can see here
to make sure my quads got sufficient
volume i was able to complete the
session
nearly pain-free since then my lower
back has recovered pretty well
and it's barely noticeable now hopefully
going into this next week of training it
shouldn't be much of an issue um
as i said in the past it's only taken a
few days at most
to recover fully and so i'm pretty
optimistic about my lower back recovery
for the next week finally i finished the
week off with some seated like girls
um in the lightest rep range
i did some trap ball rdl's and some
light curls
twice earlier in this week the trap
rdl's in the heavyweight range and the
light curls in the modern
range and so this time around i needed
to get all my intensities in and
i did them in on the sealed leg crawl so
i did 20 30 reps
but yeah that was essentially my
training week um
i'm now 21 weeks out from my
bodybuilding comp
i'm around seven kilograms pound total
so i'm pretty happy with how weight loss
is going
i've got two weeks left of this cut
metal cycle
and then i'm moving on to a maintenance
or a slight surplus phase during which
i'll be specializing on
chest and arm growth for around
five to seven weeks and then i'll be
finishing my prep
for my show i'll be cutting for around
12 or so weeks straight 12 14 weeks
straight
into my show but yeah that about wraps
up this training week
