hey folks it's me dr mike for
renaissance periodization as usual if
it's your first time to this channel
sorry for the awkward intro that's how
we do things here all right so this
series is called bs not supposed to
swear in the beginning of the youtube
algorithm or something like that in any
case today's topic that may not be as
true as people think is
just eat less and move more
to lose weight
and hold on i thought that was true
let's back up a little so first
when some folks talk about losing weight
and they're rendering advice to somebody
baby wants to lose weight probably never
ask them for advice
they'll say things like we'll just eat
less and move more that's it
or if you give any kind of technical
advice
even remotely technical advice or
specific advice on instagram or youtube
or facebook or fuck swipe or
grinder
people will comment on that advice and
be like just eat less and move more bro
keep it simple like okay sweet
and that's true but it's not exactly
actionable advice for people who are
struggling to lose weight that's like
having a you know a combat situation
with one military versus another and you
tell one of the sides like just destroy
more enemy combatants and equipment than
they destroy if you're simple like uh
yeah that's the big idea isn't it
fucking idiot
how do we do that that's the real
question so what is better than telling
someone well just eat less and move more
giving them actionable tips that filter
down into letting them do that for
example you could say hey
have you tried replacing regular soda
with diet soda that works really well
have you tried getting a step tracker
oh you guys will ask so i'll answer this
is the my fit i like to keep the chinese
communist government appraised of my
position at all times that's a joke
um get a step tracker pack it at 10k
steps a day
amazing advice that's the move more part
park anytime you go to the store you
park from the furthest possible open
spot and because all of the further
spots are always open that's by
definition an easy thing to do you walk
to the story walk back that increases
your steps in an easy way you don't even
have to do formal exercise another piece
of advice
pick a regular physical activity that
you like to do and will continue to do
and ideally pick it with friends to do
it with that will sort of take you to
task and be like hey like we're doing
paintball again it's saturday where the
hell are you that way you make it
regularly in physical activity that is
enjoyable becomes a regular part of your
life because all the meta statistics
they've done on people who have lost a
lot of weight and kept it off a huge
vast number of them have really awesome
physical hobbies that they enjoy and
thus they don't have to be corralled and
poked into doing any more physical
activity than they want which in some
cases when you're tired post-workout is
like any physical activity at all
another thing you could say is hey eat
mostly veggies fruits whole grains
healthy fats because if they do that
automatically their calories tend to
come down as opposed to eating mostly
junk food you can also tell them hey eat
much less junk food
and a lot of people will be sticklers
and what do you mean by junk food dr
mike you know when you see it it's like
the one supreme court justice tried to
define pornography now we can actually
be more technical with junk food
definition outside the scope of this
video but yeah less junk food almost
always results in weight loss because
you just can't eat as much non-junky
food because junk food is designed to be
super high calorie and super delicious
super easy to eat over and over and over
another piece of advice
you can tell them is say hey get a scale
and the rp diet coach app patented
designed by yours truly and set a five
percent weight loss goal over ten weeks
and then set a maintenance goal after
that for six weeks and then repeat the
process five percent weight loss over
ten weeks that sounds easy that's half a
percent a week great easy is better than
hard because there's more of a chance
that they'll actually succeed at it in
their first run
all of these kinds of pieces of advice
i'm going to do an arnold impression
later so i'll start now all of these
advices that's right plural
they're actually shit that works as
opposed to telling people something that
is true on a surface level
but there's no advice behind it right
so
yes all of these things actually result
in more movement and less caloric intake
but they also give specific actionable
tips and these are tips that work
right as opposed to tips that don't work
so for example if you just tell someone
hey just eat
less
and their diet is almost all junk food
which tons of people in america that's
actually their diet
when they eat less
the junk food
opens up a calorie deficit but the junk
food they're eating already makes them
so rebound hungry you know they can't
eat just one potato chip type of thing
that they end up just like getting super
fucking hungry
even with a very marginal cut in
calories and then they fail and they go
up it didn't work for me calorie cutting
didn't work for me a lot of people say
that they actually commented all the
time on social media calorie counting
didn't work for me like
yes because you didn't pay attention to
food quality and you didn't choose the
foods that were very satiating but you
could give that advice but instead you
tried to opt for the simplest advice
that was also ineffective right
why are we saying all this because brow
beating people with the resultant
physiology of what's going on
and not giving them helpful advice that
actually gets them there is drumroll
i'm gonna queue up my arnold
bullshit
no
stop it yes no yes yes no that's right
i'm a really shitty arnold impression
press the button and get the impression
box machine in any case
you can always do both if you really
want to tell people the grand
architecture of what's going on you can
say hey
at the end of the day weight loss is
about eating less and moving more and
here are some tips on how to get that
done and then you check both boxes of
being physiologically correct and
actually giving helpful advice which is
not bullshit and it's good and you're a
good person and then you can um you can
walk down the street happy as a clam
smiling
and you look at a neighbor and you smile
at him and he kind of doesn't smile at
you and you're like i wonder what that's
about it turns out his whole family has
been hacked to death by him they're in
the basement he's just biting his time
until he uh has a shootout to death with
the police see you guys next time
[Laughter]
that gets the comments up scott
dude somebody's gonna read the comments
before they watch the video like what
the fuck was this video about
