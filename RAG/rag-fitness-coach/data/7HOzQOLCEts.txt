hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i mean
what else would i be for i'm on the
renaissance parisian channel i don't
even know why i keep saying that but
i've got good stuff instead of just
cheesy jokes folks today's video
is about hypertrophy training talking
about establishing training quality
before moving on to concerns largely
of training quantity there's an order
here all right
so we all get a ton of common questions
about training these are probably
questions you have had yourself i
certainly
have had them and i get posed these
questions to me all the time on
instagram youtube so on and so forth
questions of quantity such as how many
reps should i be doing
how much weight should i be lifting how
many sets should i be doing
how fast should i be progressing these
are all excellent questions of
quantity but before you focus on trying
to answer them in
super high res you want to do the due
diligence of making sure
that your quality of training is super
super high
all right what does that mean so we have
three pillars of quality within each
working set
of what is considered a quality set we
did this all super in-depth explanation
for them in the last video in the series
if you
want to open up this playlist scroll
back to the last video it's the one
about all the stuff but basically
the three pillars of making sure each
set is high quality is to make sure you
have really really good technique
to make sure that your reps in reserve
are relatively low you're pushing close
to failure training hard
your relative effort is very high and
that you have a good mind muscle
connection which means there's a tension
and or burn in the target muscle itself
minimal bs with the joints and no other
muscles or body structures are holding
you back from
really pushing that muscle target muscle
heart it's like if you're curling and
you're like oh that's a great shoulder
workout
bad mind muscle connection for the
target which is the biceps
biceps should be burning and tons of
tension in them during a set you can say
okay that's a pretty good mind muscle
connection so if you have all three
then you have a high quality to your
training
now before you ask the question
of how many reps should i do and the
question of how much weight should i
lift those two questions specifically
before you ask those it really really
benefits
to consider checking your technique
first okay what about your technique
first of all your range of motion
okay if you say how many reps should i
do and you do half reps
well i could cut those reps in half and
do four range of motion it would be a
totally different answer
and better for you okay how much weight
good god like if you're cutting a range
of motion how much weight should i lift
is a
vastly different number and will
probably get you hurt over the long term
if it's inappropriate so first like if
you ask me hey how much weight should i
be using on the squat
if i want big legs the number one thing
i want to know beforehand
is what's your range of motion like the
second thing i want to know
is what's your stimulus to fatigue ratio
like as far as technique
are you hitting your quads hard right
and not hitting your other muscles super
hard so that they're limiting factors
because
before i tell you how many reps to squat
a weight or before i tell you how much
weight to put on the bar
if i'm training you in person i want to
see your technique
and make sure that with incrementally
higher loads just warming up
you're feeling it in your quads or
you're supposed to be feeling and
they're limiting factor
and it's not wrecking your hips or
hurting your knees or your ankles
once we figure out that technique that
gives us a high stimulus to fatigue
ratio
then we can start to explore how many
reps and how much weight because our rom
is good
and our safari is good right but
we have one final factor in that
technique mix to be concerned with
its reliability can you consistently
replicate that range of motion and that
exact technique that gives you the best
stimulus to fatigue ratio you can manage
reliability is huge you guys have no
idea how many folks i've trained over
the years that i'm like
here's how we squat we spent 30 minutes
developing their squat like oh my god i
feel my quads this is great
and i see them in the gym a week later
and they're doing it like they're
squatting like oh my god it's awesome
i see them a month later they're
starting to cut their depth they're
starting to like lean forward or back
using their glutes too much not enough
quads and i'm like god damn it
and then two months later they're doing
the same dumb bullshit they always have
and they're like
hey man like what do you think about my
progression motherfucker you mean
regression
you got worse right so make sure that
not only is your range of motion really
good
make sure your stimulus to fatigue ratio
the exact way you position your body
to hit the muscles you want is good and
also make sure you're reliably holding
yourself to a high standard of technique
over and over and over and over again
when you have good technique by those
metrics
then we can get about specific rep
numbers other than just 5 to 30 reps per
set
so if you if you send me an instagram
video or instagram buddies or whatever i
don't know you have instagram friends
followers some shit
if you send me a video and you're like
hey how much uh you know how many reps
should i be using on this exercise
in the exercises dog shit technique i'm
straight up not going to tell you an
answer i'd be like you know what i think
focus less about reps and more about
fixing your technique when you fix your
technique usually that happens in the 5
to 10 rep range anyway
this is enough reps to give you good
practice but not so many that get tired
and start practicing the wrong technique
so technique development really is just
in the 5 to 10 rep range once you have
good technique
then i no longer give you a generality
of like oh 5 to 30 reps of hypertrophic
then we say ooh
on this exercise i bent over rows this
number of reps is usually best
and all the other ranges are not that
great for the following reasons right
but you got to get the technique first
before you say how many reps or how much
weight you're using 100
next the question of how many sets
should i be doing we have to check your
reps in reserve
your relative effort first okay to
answer the question of
are you getting enough out of each set
right
if for example your rir is six
instead of somewhere between zero and
three which is seemingly the optimal for
gains
right six reps everything means your
average working set you're ending
six reps before you go to technical
failure that's real easy
if you're actually training so easily
and then you say to me hey
dr mike or just mike in the street i'm
just like
right you say hey mike how many uh sets
should i be doing
of leg presses per workout or per week
and if i never bother with seeing how
far from failure you're taking the sets
you could tell me like i normally do 10
sets of workout three times a week
i'm over here thinking you do zero to
three alright i'm like how's this
motherfucker still alive
holy crap your quads are gonna be like
overcooked chicken like blasted in the
microwave and
pieces of quad in the microwave right 30
sets of
actual sets of hard leg pressing oh my
god that's insane to do a week right but
i might be just be baffled but then i
might do the better thing
the number three recommendation here
just go back a second be like hold on a
sec
let me see you doing a set of leg press
okay and then you know you're like
pressing pressing pressing and then you
look around and you you hit the racks
and you're like
that's a set like no it's not there's no
blood in your eyes
you're not training hard enough so if i
give you a recommendation if you give
yourself a recommendation off of volume
that is from a very very high rir that
means really far from failure
kylo is confusing with our ir if you're
going real far from fail
way too far from fail percent any volume
recommendations are gonna be some
combination of the following
very different than what you would
normally see or what you would normally
have if you were training properly
and fundamentally just wrong right
because then you're doing what a lot of
other
folks on youtube have accurately
described as like fluff volume
like someone's like yeah i do 18 sets of
delts right
every workout you're like show me and
they're like
one set you're like that was a warm-up
right and then you showed them how to
actually train
myself and jared feather and charlie and
a bunch of the folks in our little
gang of hypertrophy bandits when we get
a chance to train someone in real life
folks ask us at the gym like hey can you
watch my set
don't ever do that shit to yourself
don't ever ask us to watch your set in
the gym especially if you're training
legs
just for a world of hurt you're going to
find out when the set ends and it's
going to be according to us not
according to you
because you asked for the help so then
people are like yeah i normally do like
six sets of leg press we've had people
do two sets of leg press and be like
i think i'm dying we're like that's
probably true you should probably go to
the doctor right now
right so real high quality sets means
your total set numbers can come down a
lot which is great you have to piss away
a ton of time in the gym
and it's also great because now you know
your quality is established first and
all the questions of quantity are going
to be true
right asking how many sets to do before
you make sure that your sets are not
only good
technique but also close enough to
failure to really count
is like asking like uh what are your
best milkshake recipes if i'm using shit
as the number one ingredient i'm like
well let me think i've made a few shit
what what no stop using shitty
milkshakes all the recipes suck
if in the comments you would like to
recommend a good shit milkshake recipe i
could be proven wrong
right but if you start with crap
anything you make out of it is crap if
you start with good stuff
super hard sets with good technique then
whatever you make out of it is going to
be that much better
so give that some thought
now lastly for the quality sort of
checklist
before asking the question of how fast
should i progress
because people ask that all the time
like how much weight should i be adding
workout to work on how many reps should
i be adding how many sets should i be
adding over the weeks right how do i
progress
so we need to make sure especially if
you're more intermediate advanced lifter
that you are in touch with some
semblance of your mind muscle connection
okay what does that mean that means are
you progressing
by just moving weight and focusing on
the numbers
like you could do 10 squats with 300
pounds one week
and then 12 squats with 100 pounds
another week and then 14 squats with 300
pound another week so on and so on
when we actually look at your squats
you're just doing whatever it takes to
go low enough
and get up high enough the last three
squats in every workout are like
cantilever squats where you're like
being reborn with just your lower back
and everything
rounding it looks like some kind of car
accident in slow motion people like
what are you training there and you're
like uh survival like so not quads like
i don't know
i don't really feel anything when i
squat that's not a good idea you want
all of your efforts to be targeted at
the muscle or muscles
that you're actually interested in
growing so
don't just progress and add shit add
shit add shit what you want to do is
focus on the target muscles to give them
their best stimulus okay
once you're clued into your mind muscle
connection which means that every set
you do you never let yourself get any
extra reps any extra reps
that are not zoning in on the muscles
you want them to zone in on
like you guys know what i'm talking
about do a good strict set of leg press
and someone's like do you feel your
quads in that you're like i only feel my
quads the
entire universe was a quad at the end of
that set right you're never
finishing a good strict set of leg
presses with good mind muscle connection
someone's like
feel your quads you're like uh i don't
know my knees hurt like that's bad news
right so when you can focus in on the
muscle itself
you let progress occur organically
in the context of a high mind muscle
connection focus so your number one is
to focus
and then the sets and reps sort of or
sorry the reps in the load
kind of determine themselves based on
how you're doing so you only add load or
reps or sets
to keep the workouts hard and a bit
harder over time for accumulation but
fundamentally
each time you come into the gym you're
not like i gotta do ten reps you're like
i do
high quality every single rep and if i
get to 10 reps at this
rir that i'm targeting awesome and if i
don't something is a miss
but if you're doing things right and
you're targeting the muscle itself over
time progress is just natural
as you gain muscle as you gain strength
as you gain fitness right
chasing numbers is a good idea but never
for their own sake
you always want to be aware of the log
book you always want to be aware of how
strong you are and that you're
meaningfully adding strength over time
but you never want that to come
at the expense of a mind muscle
connection if you finish a pr
on squats or let's say you finish your
pr on skull crushers
like i did it fucking strongest of all
time for me
and someone's like all right yeah so a
great hit for your triceps right and
you're like i don't know man towards the
end i'm just kind of eating out reps
however i could
that is not hypertrophy training i'm not
sure what that is because you're using a
non-strength exercise and a non-strength
rep range
to do strength training because there's
nobody handing out awards for like hey
you have a high work capacity in the gym
good job like the ceo of dell computers
isn't like next to you in the rack and
sees you do a
skull crusher pr or 115 for 16 reps and
the elbow's flared and i'm using triceps
he's like
son i've never i've never seen anyone
try that hard on a stupid assistance
lift in their life
i'd like to give you a million dollars
right now you're like gee whiz mr dell
thanks so much that's just not happening
right so focus on the target muscle and
let the reps and sets
or let the reps and load determine
themselves and how do you add sets well
if you're doing a great job
focusing super high ir great technique
mind muscle connection
and you do four or five sets and it
barely gets you sore it barely gets you
a pump
you know the quality is not an issue
then you can add quantity right but
oftentimes when folks such as myself are
like pro
adding sets we only add sets when we
need them a lot of times we don't add
that many sets we start out with a
really low set number
and we add a few sets here and then over
the course of the measure why don't we
add a lot of sets
because the sets when done right mess
you up so much assuming so much must go
with you don't need to do a trillion of
them
to get really really great results so
summing all this up
before you ask what how much of what
should i be doing before you ask how
much in the gym how much load so on and
so forth
make sure that what you are doing the
ingredients we're baking in are high
quality
your technique your reps in reserve and
your mind muscle connection
right then you can focus later on the
nitty-gritty of exactly how much what's
my mrv
so on and so forth do i add two and a
half pounds to the bar
or five pounds or do i add a wrap or do
i add two so on and so forth right
yeah technically you have to answer some
of the how much questions
to even as a beginner when you don't
have any things checked in because
you're like i just don't know
literally where to start but don't over
invest into specifics start with the
basics low ball the basic quantities
do sets of five to 15 reps on average
low rep
uh in reserve relatively close to
failure three or less and like
three to eight sets per muscle per
session and then really spend your time
focusing on perfecting your technique
making sure you're training hard enough
percent and getting a little bit of an
idea at least of that mind muscle
connection
as you really establish a high set
quality then all the nitty gritty of
okay
can i go five to thirty reps uh do i
have to start at three
sets per session or can i start at two
or can i go to ten instead of eight
all that stuff starts to become much
more pertinent
and much more worth your time right so
tldr if you ask me or anyone who knows
their shit
how many sets for quads should i be
doing then i see you squatting
and like there's a pool of lava under
your ass and you don't want to burn
yourself so it better not squat any more
than
six inches down right uh i can't
actually give you a good answer
nobody can until you fix your quality so
get on to fixing your quality
then assess your quantity and at the end
of that whole process
you'll be enormous so giant that you'll
barely be able to touch your own face
you just be crying but you won't be able
to wipe off
your own tears folks thank you so much
see you next time for the next video
