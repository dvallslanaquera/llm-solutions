if you see a fitness coach doing this
with their clients or if you've hired a
fitness coach and they're doing it with
you
or you see anybody else in the gym doing
this in general that is a clear
indication that they have absolutely no
idea
what they are doing
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i want to
explain one of the
absolute worst mistakes i see being made
in the gym
over and over again it makes absolutely
no sense at all and it genuinely will
significantly reduce the effectiveness
of your workouts i see
personal trainers doing this with their
clients i see training partners doing
this when the other one is performing
their set and it's just
legitimately painful to watch if you're
new to the channel and you're looking
for straight ahead

fluff and gimmicks don't forget to

so that you don't miss out on any future
videos and let's go over this
so uh let's set the scene here okay bob
is performing a set of barbell bench
presses and he's aiming for
uh let's say eight reps so the first
reps are pretty easy
rep four and five are a bit more
difficult now he gets to rep
six and the weight is getting more
challenging the bar speed starts slowing
down a bit
bob is starting to really dig down deep
and uh push hard for those last few reps
and at that very point his uh trusty
training partner let's call him
i don't know vince what's going on guys
vince sees that bob
is starting to struggle a bit and so
naturally he thinks well my
training partner is starting to struggle
so that means that i should help him so
vince puts his hands on the bar and
starts assisting bob with those last few
reps and the harder the lift gets the
harder that bob is pushing
the more assistance vince ultimately
gives they finish off those last three
reps and they re-rack the weight
rest and repeat now this is something
that i'm sure you see in the gym all the
time yourself
and for probably a reasonable percentage
of people watching this right now
this is probably something that you're
currently doing in your own training
whether it's you and your lifting
partner helping each other out
on the bench press or maybe one is doing
uh let's say leg presses and the other
is pushing on
the sled from behind or one is doing leg
extensions or leg curls and the other
has their hand on the pad
helping to lift the weight up and down
or maybe it's overhead dumbbell presses
and the spotter has
their hands on the lifter's elbows to
help press the weight up
to put it bluntly this is truly one of
the
dumbest mistakes you can possibly make
during your sets
and that's because it completely defies
the entire logic of muscle growth
now if you're still a novice then it's
completely understandable how you could
be making this mistake
you know you're still learning the ropes
you're still piecing things together in
the gym
and it's a natural reaction to feel like
as the spotter
you're supposed to be doing something to
help out and you also want to make sure
that your lifting partner is safe of
course but you know the fact that i see
personal trainers doing this all the
time and not just average
run-of-the-mill
you know certified personal trainers at
your local planet fitness
but even supposedly higher level
trainers where they actually have their
hands on the bar
and they're assisting from the very
first rep of the sets that's where it
just
really frustrates the hell out of me
because it's such an obvious fundamental
mistake
and it just shows a complete lack of
understanding of
basic training principles okay when you
perform a set
the entire goal of that set is to get to
those last few very difficult reps
where you are pushing or pulling as hard
as you can and the muscle is being
challenged
right up near its maximum strength
capacity those are the stimulative reps
those are the reps that trigger your
body to adapt
and to build new muscle tissue in
response all the easier reps leading up
to that point are only being done
in order to get to the point where
you're performing those last
probably three or so highly challenging
reps that's what actually
flips on the growth machinery inside of
the muscle your body doesn't adapt to
things that it can already do
relatively easily it adapts when you
present it with a workload that it isn't
yet optimized for
so that it can become optimized to that
workload in the future
so if the mentality of the spotter is
that once it starts getting difficult
that's my cue to jump in and start
helping
it's ultimately the most
counterproductive thing they can
possibly do it's literally the complete
opposite of what is best for the lifter
at the very point in the set where
significant muscle growth is about to be
stimulated they're jumping in and making
the weight lighter and less
challenging and they are preventing the
lifter from truly getting in
those last few really stimulative reps
the lifter is
right there about to hit that point and
the spotter is actually stopping them
from getting there now obviously there
are varying degrees to this
uh some spotters are worse than others
some give a ton of assistance way too
early and they genuinely
destroy the effectiveness of the entire
set altogether and
others might give less help to where the
set is still
stimulative but it's just less
stimulative than it could be but
the bottom line is that as long as the
lifter is
not in any kind of danger so the weight
is moving along and the form is still
solid then the spotter really has no
business at all putting their hands on
the bar
and assisting with the reps period not
only does it make the set less effective
but it can also be distracting as well
you know when you're focused and you're
exerting yourself maximally and then all
of a sudden there's a pair of
sweaty hands right in front of your face
that can actually throw you off as well
and then on top of that
it also prevents you from being able to
track your progress accurately if your
spotter is giving assistance on every
single set even if it's only
a small amount of help on maybe the last
couple reps
you have no way of measuring exactly
what percentage of the weight you're
lifting
versus how much the spotter is lifting
and so you can't track progressive
overload properly
you don't actually know if your training
performance improved over the previous
sessions because you don't know how much
weight you're actually lifting
so it's just wrong on every possible
level the only real purpose for a
spotter would be
for safety reasons uh if for some reason
you're lifting really heavy on a given
set on
a more precarious exercise let's say
like maybe an overhead dumbbell press or
maybe on a barbell bench press where
there are no safety catches it's really
only a select few lifts where that would
even apply
either that or just for general
motivational purposes you know if you
have a training partner
and you guys are there to encourage each
other and pump each other up
or if you are a trainer who actually
knows what they're doing and you're
assessing the person's form and you're
giving them certain form cues during the
set but that's really it
the only exception where spotter
assistance would make sense would be for
more advanced lifters
if they're employing certain
high-intensity techniques like
forced reps or slow eccentrics things
like that let's go again
but those sorts of techniques should
only be used sparingly in the first
place and usually only by more
experienced trainees
so that's the rant for today okay stop
giving unnecessary assistance to your
training partner
stop letting them assist you and if you
see a fitness coach doing this with
their clients
or if you've hired a fitness coach and
they're doing it with you or you see
anybody else in the gym
doing this in general that is a clear
indication that they have absolutely no
idea
what they are doing and if you want to
