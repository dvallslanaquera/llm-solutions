when you're actually in the training
every single set you train at least to
three reps in the tank
when the bar starts to slow down and
really fight you
at least that hard if I watch you do a
set at the gym and you're like and Iraq
if that's a work set that's not a
 work set that's a warm-up
at least three reps in reserve and or
really at most if I'm saying that
properly and potentially all the way to
failure and beyond that doesn't mean you
have to go to feeling and Beyond to get
your best growth but it should be hard
the bar should notably slow down and
fight you at the end of every single set
