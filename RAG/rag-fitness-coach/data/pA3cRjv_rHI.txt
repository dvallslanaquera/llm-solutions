folks we're back with the the shit
bi-weekly q a i almost said weekly q a
look at mike's flexing on me he's
already trying to posture me down for
this week's episode god damn it
listen to me james i'm in charge this is
my show you're just the guest michelle
i i'm actually not in uh and we uh scott
hoon's the sound guy or as we call him
around these parts daddy i'm not in his
good graces at the moment because we've
been working on the audiobook for mel's
book the habit building book and
audible is just a pain in the butt so
i've been bugging scott lately like i
need the dbs adjusted on all these files
who recorded it
um scott did
oh sorry who voiced it oh i did i well i
i read the the book and then there's a
few parts where mel walks people through
some of her worksheets and then her and
i did like a q a at the end like an
interview i gotcha that's funny
you shouldn't say that like it shouldn't
if you know because like my audible blah
blah blah book title you know by melissa
davis and it should just stop there it
shouldn't be like like voiced by james
hoffman you should just be like mal it's
like hello listen to me
but it's with a god your habits are bad
you're not doing it
yeah so uh scott is probably
ruining me at the moment just like oh
like fucking james painting my ass
i'll hopefully hears this yeah two more
yeah he's going to be muting me the
whole episode
for the questions
to
the questions away
all right
so first up is
a stupid gentle person frame of me
oh god
n-e-c-u
why don't you just type that out in
there james all right
nonsense oh there we go
are you from uh from the fucking
warlord uh is this uh someone from
tatooine i was taking the same thing let
me guess it's a fat loss question jk
hey look that's in there already
walk on nola slugs if it fits your
macros one huh
was like he reads like some like
precision nutrition thing where it's
like fats are they bad for your health
he's like
[Laughter]
he's pounding frogs
from the thing maybe like james hoffman
is standing in front of jabba's like
fucking pit and and the translator
robots like sir jabba would like to ask
you why you said that obesity and health
cut-offs were what they were and you're
like sir java please
i'm here to report the evidence it hits
the button tosses me into the rancor pit
like no
i love it all right
so naku asks dear mike and james please
debunk the next two quote-unquote myths
that is bad after workout gummy bears
are
i like that those are immediate those
are already myth level
you know what i mean like it's not just
like oh somebody said this these are
already nuts
for instance i am eating five eggs
uh 30 grams protein and seven rice cakes
40 grams carbs after workout is it true
that my post workout is really bad
because as a beginner not pro
bodybuilder i have no intentions to
remove beautiful yolks
which is fat and slows absorption after
workout which means i sabotage my
progress terrible gummy bears after
workout insulin spike quick carbs
scientifically proven
as a second myth and it's becoming quite
a thing now have you heard about it well
we may have been
a part of what generated that myth uh
quote unquote uh so let's just cut to
the chase
um
because you're a beginner you can eat
whatever fuck you want after workout
doesn't matter as long as it's protein
and you're fine and it has carbs in it
that's a big bonus and if it has like
not a ton of fats then yeah there's like
a tiny marginal improvement but i
wouldn't worry about any of that so i
think you're good to go as you get more
and more serious about training you may
want uh slightly and slightly
higher marginal results which means you
take your post-workout fats down to a
very low amount if you're curious i'm
not going to google it for you but
there's at least one research paper that
mechanistically proves that a high
intake of fats post workout actually
shuts down
muscle growth to some pretty significant
extent mind you this is i think i
believe just only fats and at a very
high dose but um there are other
mechanisms and thoughts about that so i
would say if you're really really
serious you you know keep your fats
legit like not psychotically high i'd
say your fat calories should be lower
than your carb and protein calories so
like if you split it up into three
macros and how many calories come out of
each fat calories should be lower than
your proteins and carbs and that's how
james and i give you the nod of like
you're trying
if your fat calories are higher than the
other ones that sweet you're eating food
and you know and look over the long term
if your daily macros are good it's not a
big deal
as far as gummy bears hey listen
they're a quick digesting carb source in
the context of uh having them with a
protein shake specifically whey they're
actually an excellent post-workout
source and there's nothing wrong with
them i wouldn't call them a myth it's
just a thing
uh james
yeah absolutely you nailed it on the
head so uh neko or however we say your
name here really like you don't have to
worry about this too much unless you're
as mike said like your training starts
to become more intense because you're
getting more and more jacked and your
demands go up really like i think that
where this is the most important is when
you are training multiple times per day
and your recovery kind of in between
sessions can be limited by your
nutrition right so if you are just
training let's just say like five times
a week like a normal human being would
you don't have to worry about this a ton
right there is a marginal benefit to
having like high glycemic infest digest
excuse me high glycemic carbs from fast
digesting proteins after your workout
however that benefit is pretty small so
it's not really a huge thing to fuss
over
if you are somebody who is like a
collegiate soccer player who maybe does
a practice session a training session
and maybe a conditioning or skill
session maybe three training sessions
per day mike and i would be more
inclined to say yeah you need to really
think about minimizing your fats after
your workouts and really getting those
glycemic carbs but for somebody like you
uh you don't really have to worry about
it too much if you want to be doing like
your best efforts as mike already said
think about reducing your fats post
workout and entertaining the idea of
higher glycemic carbs but you could also
just keep eating like the the rice cakes
and that would be completely fine like
if you wanted to change what you were
doing you could just switch from eggs to
egg whites and that would be like a
perfectly fine adjustment you wouldn't
have to really do anything from there i
know you still want to eat the yolks and
that's that
personally i think that's fine even if
you're training like six times per week
if you're doing kind of beginner level
training
keep doing what you're doing
boom
next up is i believe it's mr henrik
anderson with again a trillion up votes
mr anderson oh i spelled it wrong but i
still found it
all right
all right
i'm about to enter a very stressful
semester school work and life in general
to save time i started incorporating
more intensity techniques for smaller
muscle groups such as stealth calves
biceps forms et cetera however my
questions are do intensity techniques
result in horse hypertrophy compared to
straight sets if volume and intensity is
equal uh some combination of almost
certainly not slash we don't know james
agreed so far totally
for the question above does your answer
change based on muscle in question belts
versus quads for example yes actually it
does
uh intensity technique for intensity
techniques for
a very large very fast twitch muscles or
have a lot of faster stretch fibers
hamstrings
uh spinal erectors quads glutes
sometimes you need to really um
make some long rest times with those
muscles to really tap into everything
and intensity techniques can sometimes
violate the four factor rest model that
we've talked about if you don't know
what that is just feel free to youtube
in like
rest
rest breaks israel tell or
rp for rest like number four um and
you'll get something but basically it's
there's scientific principles birch
retreating right over by the book well
you know a lot of this is like if you
bought the book it's kind of uh it comes
with it so
yeah you know like basically like your
cardio could be limiting your muscle
contraction versus your muscle
contraction itself
and that's not good because then that
could result in such not so great things
so like if james and i are flying you
know let's say we get to england for a
seminar and we have to train in the
morning and then go do seminar stuff and
then come back at night we only have two
hours of train james and i could easily
do
like a fast delt bicep workout tons of
intensity techniques but if james or i
come up to each other and go like hey
i'm trying to smash quads here we got
like 45 minutes we're gonna be like uh
what's your plan
yeah like some of that stuff and also
safety things like you're warming up
just takes a while because you don't
want to fuck up uh
yeah like mike said sometimes the
systemic fatigue can be overwhelming for
the bigger muscle groups and frankly and
this isn't meant to sound like a cop-out
to anybody but like pain like if you're
doing fucking quads like sometimes those
techniques are just awful for that
muscle group and you're just like fuck
this this sucks too much and you know
rightfully so like some like could you
maybe get away with doing like drop sets
or maybe mile wrap some like a knee
extension or something like that yeah
sure um but then again that's maybe not
like the best bang for your buck in
terms of a quad workout for that day so
i think um yeah that's that's a tough
one on some of those bigger muscle
groups
next is do intensity techniques cause
more systemic fatigue than straight sets
generally no uh if the stimulus is
roughly the same then the fatigue is
probably roughly the same
um
so i wouldn't bet on that sometimes
actually less sometimes they cause a bit
less of both
so the stimulus isn't as great but the
fatigue isn't as great but so the big
thing about intensive techniques is they
save you a lot of time
uh but generally you know they don't
really
muck up the stimulus to fatigue dynamics
um
next one is which muscles would you
recommend i use intensity techniques on
which would you not recommend
uh well like sort of like we said i
think the you know chest
back
glutes quads hams
i'd probably leave to normal training as
much as possible the other stuff can be
intensity basically smaller muscles
james
am i missing anything there
no i think that's good and there's also
um
i think there's depending on which
muscle groups you're choosing there's
also like a safety consideration because
like i'm imagining like doing some kind
of bench pressing variation or something
like that and it's like yeah good good
luck um
you don't want to get stuck or drop the
weight on yourself but yeah usually i
find that the smaller muscle groups tend
to just be a better pick for those
especially if you're just doing it
because you're in a time crunch um you
can do it on the bigger muscle groups
but again like cardiovascular
limitations pain limitations and then
safety limitations should starts to
factor in
yeah
and then lastly
do you recommend any other assign
time-saving techniques slash strategies
that will worsen our perfect results
well compound alternating supersets
generally
aren't great for my personal results i
will say that because you're in a
stressful semester
probably james is going to say this
anyway but i'll beat him to the punch
this time you might just want to take a
maintenance phase you know like bingo
yeah but um and then you can do real
real short workouts and not worry about
at all actually it's probably our best
recommendation for you
because you got to wonder like all the
other fatigue stimulus coming in if you
try to get equivalent hypertrophy
there's a lot of stress coming in and
stress actually reduces hypertrophic
outcomes whether or not your training is
higher or lower it'll still do that so
you might kind of like be
you know it's kind of like you can go
across to see the island in any weather
but you're choosing to paddle faster
during the storm like maybe just wait
till the storm's gone and you can
go so
uh
i think that's a great strategy
yeah yeah any other time-saving
techniques don't say my reps don't
forget about my reps they're great for
time-saving techniques and they work for
a lot of stuff even on things like hack
squats and leg presses but uh that being
said man you know i think i think this
is a real good time for me against james
yeah whenever we get into like the time
saving techniques i think that always
opens up the can of worms of like
why do you need why do you need time
saving techniques do you have other more
important things going on and that
generally goes to that next level of
like maybe you should think about taking
a maintenance phase now there are times
where like yeah life sucks you're going
to have uh jobs school family stuff
going on and sometimes you you just need
to bang out some workouts and they're
not going to be the best workouts in the
world and you just got to get them done
that's when like the the super sets like
mike said can be really useful
other times like if you don't really
need to be doing hard training and you
have to maybe have to think about a
little bit like do i really need to be
doing a cut or a mass phase right now
um and a lot of the times you think like
you know no i don't i could actually
just do a maintenance phase from cruise
and i've had tons of clients of my own
who were in dental school who were in
law school who had families who had
other things going on and we're doing a
cut and they finally are just like yo
i can't do this and i'm like i don't
know how you did it this long like let's
just do an agent and they're like and
then they do maintenance for a month and
they're like oh my god this is amazing
this is so great why didn't we do this
before like yeah i know
so it's totally fine it's not a cop-out
yeah
absolutely give that some thought
hendrick all right next person actually
james can you scroll down one i want to
see what that rust thing says
console cadets
can you can you open it up
there's one sorry yeah question
um
dr mike is my hero rolling on the floor
laughing
no cap which crystal and i uh just
recently found out means i'm not lying
that's the truth
uh another slang for you james there you
go
uh
it's something hood motherfuckers say a
lot because i think they assume
each other is lying
i don't know
they say like way too much uh want to
meet him in real life he and dr james
are smart as hell but they are funny as
shit yes
all right
i've been bodybuilding enthusiasts on my
life one of my goals is to compete in a
bodybuilding show just to get experience
i have been powerlifting and hypertrophy
training since i was a teenager i'm now
27 would still consider myself an
amateur what advice would
give to someone like me
who would like to compete in a show but
has no experience i'll have that advice
in just a sec i understand a little bit
but i'm sure there's more to know
outside of the obvious ones thank you
guys
uh if you exactly read this message ps
dr mike when you have your beard you
look like zangie from street fighter
thank you
uh i made this joke before i found out
you were actually from russia which is
cooler and even funnier another
interesting thing is our beards are
actually quite rare in russian uh people
like a clean shaven face in russia which
is there are like archetypes or
stereotypes about russians from
americans that are some of them are spot
on like most of them are fucking
alcoholics uh and some of them are just
work way off base um most russians
actually don't live in the wilderness so
the whole thing like oh bears regular
thing in russia like almost no russians
have ever seen a bear and most of them
do they'd freak the fuck out and run
away it's like canadian it's like
canadians like oh you guys live with
bears to be like what the fuck are you
talking about we live in toronto so uh
anyway we go on i'll tell you what my
exact piece of advice to you is hire a
coach hire coach uh somebody like steve
hall from revive stronger and his team
jess and the other folks that work there
uh they're really really good they work
with drug free people they're really
gonna meet at your level they're gonna
do an awesome job i would say sam
okanola uh jared feathers booked up all
to shit uh samo canola pretty booked up
um unfortunately probably for some time
um
and i think with someone for the first
show i think if you get into a couple
shows in reaching out to sam and jared
and rp is a really good idea i think the
revive stronger folks are just really
what you're looking for um but highly
highly rather bring on that james yeah i
was going to go the same route i'll just
add one layer on top of that you
definitely want like a prep coach in
terms of the training and nutrition
stuff but also a posing coach if you've
never done it before it's a little weird
so get opposing coach too
uh all right next up is vasil gillef
p-a-s-i-l
only one by seal as far as i know there
we go
okay i'm in my fourth year of training
and have a decent foundation physique
wise at least i would assume so but my
upper body is lagging behind
aesthetically due to my narrow shoulder
girdle and average bicep tricep and
shoulder insertions
i wouldn't say average is lagging behind
but okay
i'm facing a dilemma should i after my
cut run the rp shoulder and arm
specialization or not
is there too much of an opportunity cost
for back and chest which also
which i also want to grow a lot more yes
i also want bigger everything and i
consistently have noticed i cap out
systemically at 150 to 120 cents so good
good to know which gives my shoulders
and arms two to four average mrv
uh as per rp guidelines uh you know so
let's see the first thing is this is all
really a value judgment up to you
then it depends on how soon you want to
have a balanced physique if your balance
physique goal is for between seven and
ten years from when you started training
which is when most physiques quote
unquote mature if you're doing things
right then you don't have to worry about
shit right now and for the next several
years you can just train all around if
you like want to be in fuck boy shape
within a year i would start training
shoulders and arms more you can consider
the shoulder arm specialization you
should also look at some of our other
specialization stuff we just came out
with and potentially will be coming out
with something within the next few
months that is really really going to be
up your alley for specialization but
it's super top secret james and i just
started talking about it and uh
it's super top secret so i can't say
anything else so maybe hold off on that
purchase i can't believe it taking money
out of our own fucking pocket
um
but uh yeah
yeah i would say it's really just up to
you but give that before you will james
before you answer your version the video
you have right next to it is a predator
meets
psycho in mma
that looks a lot like tank abbott and
maybe don fry oh it is not for i called
it i just saw his back that's how good i
am in mma i can just look at a nice
muscley back and know who it is oh my
god oh sorry that one
uh
you know i don't remember i'm gonna
guess john fry uh i'm surprised to scare
motherfucker i would never fight that
man he still is a scary motherfucker
um let's see so um so real quick just
side tangent and i'll answer your
question the seal uh i don't know about
you guys but i am very excited about the
pay-per-view this weekend we're going to
see the rematch from like 17 years ago
of nick diaz and robbie lawler what a
shit show oh what a shit show nostalgia
fight that is so i am i was on that card
valentina shivchenko's defending against
lauren murphy and uh
uh volkanovsky's uh fighting uh ortega
for the belt
oh wow yeah russians
chef chef jinka is probably not losing
for some time huh
no i don't see her losing to anyone
frankly and i wish she would have
distanced herself from amanda nunes
because i think valentina is probably
one of the best mma athletes ever um but
i think she doesn't quite get that rub
because she lost to amanda twice and i
mean i think i think of valentina would
have just been like the 125 pound best
fighter ever
she would get so much more credit but
she fought amanda at 135 and lost to her
twice and so she always gets kind of a
snub from from amanda um and the thing
with her too i think i looked at the
odds she's like a plus like 1300
uh favorite right now which for those of
you who don't bet that means you need to
put down thirteen hundred dollars to win
one hundred dollars
uh to make money on valentina for this
upcoming fight so that's a huge
advantage yeah and i think lauren
murphy's at like an eight-to-one dog
right now so it's actually not a
terrible idea to just throw like 20
bucks on lauren murphy because you'll
get a huge payout um
in order to in order to make any money
off valentina you need to have a big
bankroll
so yeah i'm excited for that one
hopefully you guys will watch as well
okay sorry bastille um one thing that i
have done with my clients especially my
male clients who are kind of in a not
exactly the same but kind of similar
where they're like i really want to you
know get the kind of the fuckboy look as
mike says um but i'm not sure if i want
to just not go all in on some other
things a lot of times what i'll just do
is an upper focus right where um maybe
put a little bit of extra juice into the
the target ones like arms and shoulders
but still train chest and back really
hard and then basically just put you
know abs
quads hams glutes calves any of the
lower body stuff at uh like mv levels
and that usually works really well you
could probably milk out some of the
other gains while still making some
pretty significant progress in your
target area so one thing to consider is
just doing like an upper specialization
maybe not as narrow as just like an arm
and shoulder specialization especially
if you're only about four or four years
in you could probably kind of still get
away with that
boom
[Music]
mike s
is up next
it
oh fuck
oh i just pushed it arsenal i just
looked at the upvote number not the uh
actual thing well
here we are oh wow all right
so
uh mike s asks or says would love to
hear the story and mindset behind the
dollar sign tattoo which one is it this
one there it is look at them delts um
it is a symbol
from the book
uh from a book by the author and
philosopher ein rand
and
it is um
what's it called
basically just stands for
what comes pretty close to being a
religion of mine uh sort of not so close
uh it's objectivism
basically it's a philosophy that's like
the real world exists doesn't matter how
you feel about it
and uh working hard and diligently at
solving problems makes all the wonderful
things you see around you
and hoping and wishing and dreaming
doesn't do shit
and productive people are the
cornerstone of our society so i would
say
somebody like jeff bezos or elon musk
are just better period and the more
people it could be like them
the better because they produce an in a
very actually objectively calculable
higher value for society than everyone
else i'd also views capitalism
as a very good thing generally
the capitalism is a thing that has the
double thank you moment if you buy a
soda at 7-eleven
the cashier thanks you honestly for the
money because they need it more than the
soda and you honestly thank them for the
soda because you by definition needed
more than the money
and capitalism is then win-win and is
amazing and it produces probably
everything you like in this life except
for like you know the love of a of a
child which sex produces i'll have you
know that's how children are born which
can also be purchased through capitalism
sure you can adopt children and pay for
not condoms and do i mean sex
sex can be purchased through capitalism
sex that makes a child difficult to
purchase but certainly people do it all
the time um
so
yeah uh iran has so my other tattoo is a
gear
um
that uh is from another iran book
and uh yeah let's give it a shot
uh
and
that's it oh it just took to preempt
some responses in case you get finicky
in the comments
uh how do i say this politely
almost every objection to objectivism is
a red herring
because the people who critique it are
usually just deep down
leftists at heart and
we feel a lot and mistake it for
thinking so if you're going to put in
comments that say that ayn rand is a bad
person on a personal level uh it's
actually um
ad hominem attack it's already invalid
if you're gonna say that objectivism has
problems i probably agree with you to
some extent
and uh if you're gonna say it's
completely defunct system then you're
probably wrong in multiple levels and i
probably won't be commenting because uh
just get basic economics by thomas soul
or any other base geek on book read it
and then you'll probably have slightly
different view
uh
yeah
that's that let's beat that one today
all right next up get these dr mike
personal questions out of my face no
honestly i'm never i'm just gonna read
these from now on
uh i couldn't give a shit about myself
personally but andrew atkinson atkinson
atchison atchison
definitely has a question mr worthwhile
all right
hi doctors i have a question about
cardio especially in a cut it's average
with the cardio across the week for
example instead of
one 90-minute cardio session three
30-minute sessions or six 15-minute
sessions i wonder on both health
benefits between them and also the
calorie burning benefits are cutting too
many thanks always
for me english mate in it bravo
yes that was good yes i don't talk like
that haha andrew of course you talk like
that
you don't have to be ashamed of it we
know you're
you're a fucking from south london
you're one of those guys that wears like
a fur coat even though it's
30 degrees celsius outside because
you're a vip as fuck
what are they called chavs that's what
you are in code it is jeff's
boy fuck off there's a there's like you
know basically like the same kind of
person as conor mcgregor
in english style
he got busted for throwing a very shitty
first pitch at a cubs game recently
man's probably never thrown on
ball throwing sports are not exactly
ireland's bag yeah
i thought he was going to fight one of
the players or something like that or
pissed off he actually like almost got
into like he got into like a tiff with
machine gun kelly at one of the fancy
award shows why would you ever do that
machine gun kelly would be killed by one
punch this is an insane proposition
especially from like maybe the most
accurate punch thrower of all time
like yeah jesus christ maybe machine gun
kelly was talking about shit who knows
maybe
who knows maybe connor is just doing it
i think he's just like a what are they
uh what they call him in ireland knacker
like knacker yeah just a person of low
social status
all right
so
to answer this question i think it's so
first of all the best way to cut in a
cardio context is a cutting that has the
highest stimulus to feed ratio the
stimulus is calories burned the fatigue
is the fatigue accrued while doing
cardio
so being that that's the case generally
speaking the optimum cardio if we're
really going to talk about it is
spreading it infinitely or near
infinitely to where you wear a step
tracker and then all your cardio just
gets done pretty random pass throughout
the day that's probably the lowest
lowest fatigue you can get cardio same
calorie burning
i think everything else generally comes
down to how it fits into your lifestyle
because it's such a small concern in the
other case that i would say look at look
if you have one 90-minute cardio session
monday nights are free and you're really
pissed after working and that's which
when you grind you put in your music you
put in a movie you fucking get it done
that's awesome three 30 minute sessions
or six fifty minute sessions
are just as effective roughly
maybe they have a little less fatigue on
average on the physiological side did
you potentially carry more fatigue on
the scheduling side where you look up
and you're like shit i still have to do
50 minutes of cardio today fuck why
don't you cardio every day this is so
stupid so if it's not super fatiguing
spreading it out more is best all the
way to the limit extreme of having a
step tracker then you spread it out sort
of throughout the entire day
and then generally speaking on up just
purely on paper physiology
one or two long ultra long cardio
sessions probably not the best because
it generates more fatigue than we would
like but if it's best for your schedule
it really just comes down to that which
is honestly why james and i outside of
our very highly elite clients that need
to worry about like maximizing leg
muscle
when people ask about cardio we
generally say like whichever way you can
get it done is 97 of the way there to
optimality
uh james
yeah yeah that was very good answer um
so kind of on dr mike's point here i've
been just doing an experiment with
myself so i'm not trying to say this is
the
right or wrong way to do it but it's
just food for thought so i've been using
a step counter on my watch lately which
is something that historically i haven't
done so you know kind of somewhat new
for me and i've definitely been noticing
like my step count can be pretty low if
i don't make an effort to like go and do
stuff which is kind of alarming because
i always just assumed i was living a
very physically active lifestyle but it
turns out i'm actually a bit of a couch
potato when i'm not training um so
that's kind of the funny part so here's
the strategy that i've been using um i
have the luxury of being able to work
out at home so i'll already preface this
by saying i have a home gym so this is
practical for me probably not for
everyone else um so what i have been
doing is i've been pairing
uh step counts and i've actually been
using some of the things from dr davis's
habit book shameless plug
and what i've been doing is i have a tv
set up by the treadmill and i will do 15
minutes of cardio just you know normal
list style cardio and i will allow
myself to watch whatever shows or movies
that i'm very compelled to watch so i
watched all of the neon genesis
evangelion rebuild movies which i'm a
big fan of that series and i would only
allow myself to name
lame i would only allow myself to watch
them in 15-minute chunks and only when i
was doing cardio so what i would do is i
would go in the morning i would do my
the first thing i would do is i'd wake
up take the dogs out and then go do my
15 minutes of cardio and i would just do
that as my like warm up and then i would
do my first session in the morning which
is the hardest stuff for that session
take a break have some meals throughout
the day i would come back at a later
time
pair that with again watching the show
that i really want to watch i'd watch it
for another 15 minutes and then i would
do my pm session and that automatically
gets my step count up to like 7 000 by
like noon which for me is great at that
point and if i don't do that i might not
even get to 10 that day so that's just
something i've been doing as kind of
mike said to spread it out almost at
like an infinity level of just saying
okay i can do a little bit of cardio
every time i lift and if i split up my
lifting sessions and force myself to do
a few more steps i can really get that
step count up and if i pair that with
some kind of habit forming um you know
behavior modification like okay i really
want to watch the show normally i would
just sit at home and binge watch the
show now i'm going to prevent myself
from doing that by only doing it when
i'm uh doing my cardio session so think
food for thought those are different
strategies that you can adopt to kind of
get the step count up a little bit
yeah those are great
those are fucking great
um i i have all sorts of stuff like that
but my uh step tracker watch which is my
fit by the way people ask me all the
time and it doesn't fucking matter um
isn't fucking phenomenal because i can
be just 100 objective on my physical
activity throughout the day and i just
don't have to be like oh am i being too
lazy like fact i am not
or i am and i have to go fix it um
all right let's actually uh i'll knock
off another one of the questions this
one actually got i never saw it thanks
youtube algorithm right the one right
below where to query wherever oh my
goodness
uh what benefit do you think deep tissue
massage has for recovery at ranger
prevention it subjectively feels really
good this is really really good when
they do it on your cock
at least from the adult films i've seen
it's such a fun it's such an easy porn
category yes to like start with massage
and then like all of a sudden she's
either joking oh wait but uh okay i
think it's just hilarious it's like too
easy i like that category i'm not gonna
lie i will say okay this is way too much
like way too much real talk um whatever
fuck it um
you know it's like uh if i'm jay and the
d
and i'm and i'm sober i usually just
whatever i roll with a fantasy
and if i'm if i'm
high on edible marijuana which i
again is legal in the states in which i
do it
sometimes it's amazing right it's just
way better than a regular job yeah
other times your boy gets into a mindset
it doesn't mean i have that mindset
generally cool to hang out movies seem
awesome everything is a fantasy then i
start watching porn and the first thing
i notice i'm like oh yeah she's gonna
massage him and get out of his cock you
know i'm like waiting for her to do it
and i'm like you know
this is an unbelievably terrible
technical massage he's delivering like
if i was that guy i'd be like lady what
the fuck am i paying you for she'd be
like oh i'm gonna give you a hand job
you're like right right but like that
should just be hand job price because
what you're doing with my back is like
just like
it's an embarrassment like nobody taught
you how to put your weight in like which
muscle it which tell me which muscle
you're massaging right now you have no
idea it's just awful and i can't buy in
i'm like this isn't a massage therapist
this is an adult film actress and then
i'm out dude i have the same problem
when the rules are reversed when it's
the guy massaging the girl right and
instead of actually like doing the
massage they just go right to finger
banging i'm like that's not a massage
that wasn't like a sexy scene that was
just never been trying you're not even
trying yeah i'm like no this one's done
unreal all right so james uh
oh he says it subjectively feels really
good but i wonder if you guys have any
insight on this this is all you james
please take it away
yeah so deep tissue massage is used for
a variety of reasons
most of which i think are
questionable at best so where do i think
that there is maybe a potential benefit
here
i think that there are some forms of
massage and deep tissue massage
which can allow you to um exert a
greater range of motion for a short
period of time which might allow you to
do something that has a more permanent
effect on the muscle or joint in which
you're working so what that means is if
you are able if you get like a massage
deep tissue in particular
and that kind of frees up
uh kind of a locked up body part for a
lack of better phrasing let's just say
like for whatever reason like you one of
your scaps is like really tired or uh
your hamstrings are really tight or
something like that and just have a hard
time like with stretching and just not
doing it for you sometimes you can get a
temporary relief with a deep tissue
massage that might last a little bit
longer than something like foam rolling
where it will allow you to now
move into a greater range of motion and
that's great and that will give you the
temporary relief that you're looking for
it also just down regulates pain to some
degree which is just another kind of uh
it's like taking tylenol right where you
the problem's still there you just don't
notice it as much
but in this case if you can move around
a little bit more where you can benefit
from that is now you can actually do
either rehabilitative or just standard
resistance training exercises which does
cause a permanent change in the
flexibility mobility characteristics of
the joint and muscle that's where you
get a lot of bang for your buck the way
that most people do deep tissue massage
is they're like oh i'm really stiff or
may uh
they just think it does a lot of things
that it doesn't they go and get a
massage they feel a little bit better
right it does have somewhat of like an
analgesic effect in some ways really
it's just down regulating your pain in
that area and no actual changes are
really occurring unless it's followed up
by some type of either therapy or
training so what you have to do in this
situation is kind of pair both of those
most people go get a deep tissue massage
and they're like that was great and then
they go lounge around and relax the rest
of the day really ideally this would be
a good time
if somebody's working on a specific area
for you you're going to get a temporary
benefit of just being able to move that
area a little bit more freely and that's
when you actually want to think about
doing whatever um
and what the reason i say rehabilitative
is because at this point if you're
getting a deep tissue massage you're
probably having a problem it's not just
something you're doing practically and
if you're doing it prophylactically it's
mostly a waste of time um it's it's
something you can do if you are having a
problem and then i would pair that with
like whatever your physical therapist or
someone else whatever activities they
have told you to do for whatever area
that you're having trouble moving around
but in terms of like normal exercise
conditions normal exercise non-injury
situations i would say uh
mostly a waste of time unless you enjoy
if you enjoy it by all means
just just enjoy it and just know that
that's what you're doing and that's fine
yeah
um
[Music]
man
there's a whole i've shattered to say
industry
around the promulgation of deep tissue
massage specifically for athletes
yeah what fraction of that do you think
is like if it disappeared tomorrow and
athletes put their time and money
somewhere else would be a huge net
benefit for athletes
i don't know because i feel like it's
one of those i feel like
athletes would just they would just
gravitate towards the next thing it
would just they would just move on to
some other weird thing you know what i
mean
it's just those type of people who are
um and i know a lot of people who are
high level athletes and i won't name
names and they ask me questions about
this stuff all the time what do you
think about massage what do you think
about graston i'm like
are you doing first here's what i've
learned mike as i always ask them first
are you currently doing it
because normally what i would say is
like now that's dumb and then they're
like
my massage therapist says right exactly
then you get into that exact situation
so now i say like are you are you
currently doing it more often than not
they'll say yes and i'm like do you
think you get anything out of it they're
like i'm not sure and then i'll say
something to the tune of like i don't
think you're probably getting anything
out of it unless you feel really
strongly that you are and if you all if
you do feel that way keep doing it if
not you could probably let it go
yeah
yeah
[Music]
all right
next up is
robzim1000 what
r-o-b-z-i-m
what
okay
let's see in it rob's in
[Music]
raw bism
oh rob ism
oh there we go
now we're in business
all right
oh
there's a question
hi doc i have a question regarding
quantum development i've been looking
for movements or methods to target my
vastus lateralis specifically but if i
myself flooded with information or
possibly misinformation i don't know
where to begin i'm assuming that
progressive overload with suitable
compound movement to hit all of my quad
muscles at once just the best answer and
i'm putting that into practice already i
would like to target my lateral quad for
a secondary movement in hope of
achieving a wider look for my legs is
this possible i've read and been told
about close leg squats or presses
pointing toes inward on extensions
hacked squats
sissy squats or putting my heels on a
plate i've done some trial and error but
it all feels the same and slightly
awkward neither of you have any go-to
moves or definite do's and don'ts
thank you been following for about a
year love the content i'd love the
frugal references classic anime world
man you already got one on this episode
okay i'm gonna just make one point and
then dr mike's gonna hit no why don't
you start this one off james well i was
only going to say that like you can kind
of tell that you have some goals and
you've been kind of trying to play
around with some different exercises and
techniques and he says you know it feels
slightly awkward
that's normal whenever you pick up a new
movement or you're modifying a movement
that you've been working on if you if
you've been doing normal leg presses
then you try to do close dance leg
presses if you've never done a hack
squat before it's always going to feel
awkward and shitty probably for like a
month until you get into like a really
good group and and i think dr mike even
has a couple videos on this or at least
has talked about it at nauseum you got
to give those movements some time to
kind of give yourself time to learn them
find your groove modify and
individualize the technique so that
you're feeling it in the areas that you
want to feel so just because you get
under a hack squat machine and you're
like ah
this felt like a bad session today don't
give up keep working on it keep trying
and you might find that yeah that
actually does hit the area that you want
really bad um that was the only point i
wanted to make on that real quick
yeah i mean there's some theoretical
very little research evidence some
theoretical consideration to say that if
you keep your feet relatively close
together
uh specifically if you keep your toes
from pointing out a ton
maybe it will recruit more elasticized
fractionally than the other quad muscles
now
that's saying a lot it's going to make
almost no difference but if you want
some kind of difference then closer
stance feet poured pointed a little bit
more straight than you're used to
definitely don't point your feet in
that's a fucking bad idea for your
joints
um
and i would say that's probably your
best bet feet
close to each other leg extensions or
sorry feet pointed in leg extensions
i don't know man that would grind my
fucking knees to a pulp but if it works
for you sure try it i just wouldn't go
extreme with the feet and
just keep your feet a little bit more
straight so if you normally squat like
this do this and then squat with a
narrower stance
and even squat something should be left
to how you're biomechanical if they're
ready to do them so maybe hack squats do
this leg press do that
and uh i think that's probably your best
bet but really a lot of this comes down
to um
yeah there's really only a few movements
for quad specifically where i think that
you can really distinctly tell a a
regional difference like knee extension
is a really easy one right you feel that
in the medial part of the quad for sure
you don't really feel it all over
whereas like kind of all the other ones
like most of the squatting variations
the leg pressing variations you're
feeling it largely all over the the main
the whole main body of the quad it's
very difficult to say like this region
versus that region and i'll tell you
what my friend rob robism
uh general strategies to bring up your
quads like just putting size on your
quads are probably going to take you a
long way i think unless you are you know
someone who is at the advanced level of
bodybuilding kind of like the uh if
you've ever watched pumping iron
actually arnold makes a couple really
interesting points about this um but
like unless you're at that level you
really don't have to worry and pick and
choose so much like very muscle specific
regionally specific exercises for your
muscles i think that the big sfr ones
are the ones you want to find learn and
stick with and maybe and maybe they they
overlap right maybe you find that again
maybe hack squats
it took a little while for you but they
were one of your best sfr movements and
they just coincidentally caused the
lateral part of your quad to blow up as
a result right so don't think too much
about like picking and choosing the very
regionally specific areas think about
like what's giving me the best sfr for
my quads as a whole and that's going to
take you so much further than those oh
much further
adam conrad
that is a very
hot man sounding name
sounds like some motherfuckers mini
astronaut or some shit
all right
hey docs if a protocol says three by
five at rpe seven slash three rir
do you
a do rp7 for every set
dropping the weight if necessary to hit
a seven every time
b start with rp7 and keep the weights
the same letting it increase char be
eight and possibly not or maybe only
increase by one
c end with our p7 and do a weight light
enough that you chose
choose a weight where the last set is
our p7 so as read most protocols i would
say if they do three by five and rp
seven there's one of two options
probably 50 of them maybe 45 let's say
just have never thought of the
complexity you're asking and they
wouldn't be able to tell you
the other 45 bringing our total up to 90
would probably instruct you to do option
a
modifying the weight every time to
continue to hit a seven
i've seen charlie
train our our friend and training
partner charlie train with our with rp
scale from a few good coaches and that's
how they did it like ever since rp7 so
like you know if your first set is rp7
but you feel really potentiated feel
free to go up and if you feel tired go
down every set seven
um and then 10
is some other thing that the coach will
clear up with you when he says
rp7 i really mean an average of seven so
the first can be an rp8 the second v7
the last one could be a six or the other
way around
um
so your best bet is
in good faith assuming there is
knowledge conveyed
i would say it's it's option a adjust
the weight every time do he keep hitting
us
james yeah sorry i was confused on that
at first so the thing is the reason i
kind of scoffed at a was because um i
forgot that they're using a three by
five so whenever you see a fixed rep
scheme it's very hard to assume that
you can have a fixed like
uh relative intensity scale using the
same
the reps generally can't be fixed if the
rir or the rpe is also fixed usually one
has to give at some point or it's very
unlikely that you're going to see that
across an entire work load for an
exercise it's not very hard to hit if
you're really trying like it can just
really put you in a state of like fuck
was that 7 or 7.5 you know like
it's odd advice
so like the way
the way i would tell you to interpret
that is to when you see three by five
that's kind of like assume an average of
five reps across the three sets so maybe
it's like six five four right something
like that and then you would just hold
the weight and rir constant and the reps
would adjust themselves that would make
the most sense to me um i generally have
gotten away from doing the fixed reps
because it causes so many confusions in
this in this realm though there are
instances especially for like athletes
who are stupid um
it's just easier to do it that way
um but yeah i would say assume that the
the three sets of five is like the five
reps is like an average um
to shoot for not necessarily like a hard
stop at five
yeah
anyway hopefully that helps adam um
clearly james and i don't like that um
nomenclature
we don't think about it we're snobs
about it so don't feel bad
all right mehmet
from what is almost certainly turkey
whoa
he sounds like a game of thrones
character
sweet
all right hey docs i can do around 20
sets on a single workout before being
limited by my time and my tiredness
that's a good way to put it i work out
and someone's like still got energy at
the end you're like want to do more like
nope time still uh run run is
less plenty time like tiredness i'm done
i work out six times a week and
generally do a total 120 sets a week and
generally train 10 to 12 different
muscles in my body like everyone else
lol like a lot of people
is it better to do 10 to 12 steps for
each muscle with no phase potentiation
or or mvv to mrv for certain muscles and
just mv mav for the ones
we put them in back burner if my goal is
maximum hypertrophy all around my body
by the way an intermediate lifter i
think as an intermediate you you start
to detect something
that is the muscles that if you're just
training everything in media mrv at some
point you're going to be in a situation
where
you uh can't start at med or you can't
hit mrv
and a muscle really feels constrained
based on trying to prioritize all of
them
and or the total fatigue you're
experiencing is so high systemically
that you have to lower the total amount
of training you're doing all of a sudden
you can't fit all the muscles in between
med and mrv so then you would start to
take some muscles down to mvmv
crop other muscles between med and mrv
and begin the specialization slash
prioritization
type of approach alternating every few
mesocycles which muscles you take on and
put on to the take off and put onto the
back and front burners uh so i would say
this if you are training
in
uh your way that you're doing it and you
feel like you're really giving every
muscle do justice like you're really
pushing it to the max at the end of the
meso and the systemic fatigue is not
preventing you from pushing muscles you
need to further then you think you're
good to go so for example
if you're pushing quads and glutes hard
and you're relatively advanced you'll
notice that you can't do that and push
your back hard as well should be like
how am i supposed to bent road twice a
week if i deadlift once a week and then
do slds another time a week and then do
back squats twice a week was yeah there
is no answer to that question the answer
is you can't do that
so i had that exact epiphany like early
in my career just like why why why can't
i and i probably had it about the same
time like i feel so weak what's going on
yeah and that's one of those things that
that
for program design class i used to be
able to tell the people apart that
actually lifted versus the ones that
didn't there's people that didn't
actually lift but knew programming
pretty well they're like you know
deadlift squat bent over oh three times
a week like okay no one's gonna do this
program no one any decent level of
development is going to survive the shit
so if that's you and you need to back
off and do legs big time for a few
months back take it easier and then the
other way around after if you don't if
what we just said is like actually i can
train everything pretty well then you
don't need to do prioritization phases
you're fucking golden
yeah that's a very good answer um so
mimet i think like you kind of know the
answer to some of this all right i could
tell by the way your question is phrase
like do you ever think that we're going
to say
no face potentiation or not training
from me to mrv is good for maximum
hypertrophy doggy you know the answer
you know that we're going to say you
need to do those things right
but like mike said this is an issue of
like kind of measuring where you're at
with training age measuring your time
and resources and maybe specializing i
think that um this is also a good time
to consider
uh your sfrs of the movements that
you're choosing you might find that
you're doing so many sets and it's
taking a lot of time because the sfr of
the movements that you have chosen are
poor or maybe you could individualize
them to raise the sfr so you could
actually have
more time and or resources to do other
things definitely a good thing to think
about but yeah at some point you will
probably have to
abandon the idea of making all-around
progress and having to start making more
specialized progress through
specialization phases but before you get
there if you haven't thought about your
movements for a while if you find that
you're doing you know five sets per
exercise and multiple exercises per
muscle group per session and it's taking
a lot of time maybe start thinking about
like what are some movements and stuff
what are some movements where i get a
huge bang for my buck so instead of
doing like
five sets of incline bench press
can i get the same kind of stimulus from
doing two sets of dumbbell flies like
so that frees up quite a bit of time and
resources for you so things like that
think about it rory
yeah great stuff
bradley
rid i can't yeah type in bradley and
you'll see
[Music]
bradley puppies poppies
in that his avatar is it jesus
jesus
it looks like a creepy person in a
hoodie
bradley asks
what would you recommend for increasing
someone's back squat when they have long
legs and a short torso
make back squats very taxing on the low
back
and lift at home so they do not have
access to a leg press or other such
machines
so now now let's get to the point here
the question will be answered as written
did not ask about quad stimulus it asked
about increasing someone's back squat
the answer to that is do a fuck load of
posterior chain work
because your posterior chain is probably
going to limit your back squat
performance because you have to lean
over so far
you can work on your ankle mobility that
helps you lean not as much you can buy
weight lifting shoes that helps a ton as
well
then you can just do traditional squat
work and get away with it fine but i
would say lots of stiff legged deadlifts
and especially lots of good mornings not
lost numerically but a lot of focus on
doing them well and getting stronger on
them
because your lower back and just your
torso in general is probably the
limiting factor in your squat you can do
more posterior chain focus
then you can probably squat a fuck load
more than you are now
um that's probably my best answer so far
uh james
yeah there's certainly going to at least
be you know some synergy and some of
those muscles too like your glutes will
get a lot of work which will help your
squat your back obviously um so mike
answered the question as written i think
you could also approach it from like a
face potentiated standpoint of having
some different specialization phases or
maybe trying to bring up your quads even
more with doing some non strength
specific exercises um
but that starts to get a little bit more
complicated right so i think as written
that's definitely the way to go
boom
games that's it man that's everybody oh
my goodness i saw some people uh were
giving me some love on my rifle choice
thank you very much
very appreciated hopefully you guys are
enjoying some shooting sports as well i
shamefully bought another gun mike i'm
ashamed to admit it oh there's no shame
i got it was cheap it was a it's
basically like a
it's like an ar platform 22 and just 22
is so fun and easy to shoot and it just
makes life a lot easier too yeah it's
cheap as fuck i'm really easy to find so
shame i know i know all the guns
okay so wrapping up great questions this
week dr mike any housekeeping
[Music]
on a new thing can't talk about it
so secretive
will
change lives
it will
it will what is it um
in grandma's boy like jp how's your new
game coming along he's like people will
bow to it yeah okay okay right on um
let's see i'm working on some secret
stuff too but uh one thing that's not a
secret is i'm gonna actually hopefully
later today i'm gonna have all the if if
audible cooperates i'll have all the
files for mel's audio book uploaded so
the evidence-based habit building book
should be available
on
you know uh audible probably within a
couple months pending nothing goes wrong
it's currently available on paperback
now as well you can find that on amazon
so if you guys enjoyed the ebook version
or you were waiting for a paperback
version that's out and then if you're
wanting an audio version just give it a
couple months and hopefully that will be
done
boom all right folks thanks again for
the questions really good as always and
we will see you next time
peace
