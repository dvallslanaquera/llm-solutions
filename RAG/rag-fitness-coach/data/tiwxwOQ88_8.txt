hey folks dr mike izmertel here i said
my last name right
thank you for renaissance periodization
which i also assume
is the correct pronunciation the best
exercise for your biceps
doesn't exist what the best exercise
anytime you see that shit on youtube or
instagram and someone says the best move
for pecs
the best exercise for your legs is a
myth
what the hell that means a bunch of
fitness influencers are wrong
that couldn't possibly be let's find out
why it is first we're going to talk
about the exact nature of the claim
we're refuting today
then we're going to talk about what
makes an exercise bad what makes an
exercise
good asking can a certain exercise that
you think is your best
can it be your best forever can you
truly have a best exercise
what about individual differences can a
bunch of people all have one exercise be
their best
and lastly very pertinently how to
choose
the best exercise for yourself for the
occasion for the situation
here are the claims people say shit like
the best glute exercise
or the one must do exercise for your
biceps are you doing this exercise for
your shoulders if not
you're gonna have tiny shoulders forever
people legit say shit like this
especially on youtube
all the time as it turns out it's mostly
bullshit it's got a little bit of a
grain of truth but it's mostly crap
so some people say this exercise is bad
never do it
and some of you may look at videos like
this i sure as hell did and think fuck
i shouldn't do that exercise what is
that guy's name hey
scott are we allowed to mention
youtubers by name or some kind of legal
shit going on there
athlean x that motherfucker says shit
like that all the time
you do an upright row and there's a
nuclear detonation in your shoulders it
kills a village of people in africa
that's how i understand biomechanics
turns out that's not true but but but
there can be for you an exercise that's
not a great idea
what are the check marks that we get
what is the checklist to say an exercise
is unwise
first obvious when it hurts you okay the
pain
can you have pain and exercise and it's
fine and it goes away when the pain gets
worse
with every rep with every set with an
increase in load
it's probably not wise to continue doing
without any modification
especially if pain doesn't get better
over many weeks
it's the same or it gets worse not the
lactate burn not the tension kind of
pain
pain in the joints pain and the tendons
and pain in a way that you know is no
bueno okay if that's the case maybe it's
not the best exercise in the world
now it could still be the best exercise
you're just doing it wrong but we'll get
to that later
point number two it doesn't subjectively
seem to stimulate a whole lot of muscle
growth by the way this whole thing is
for muscle growth with strength it's
very very similar
lots of sets of this exercise that's not
the greatest for you cause an
underwhelming series of events
for example the tension in the target
muscle especially
lower ups is just not very overwhelming
you know someone's like hey try this new
leg press
doesn't it fuck up your quads and you're
doing it for like sets of eight and like
can you feel the tension in your quads
you're like
not really i don't know like i feel it
in my glutes a lot
that is not a good exercise for your
quads now maybe it's the technique
that's the problem but a sure as hell
isn't a good place to start
if you're doing lots of sets of the
exercise and the burn in the target
muscle at higher reps just
isn't there okay someone said try this
new bicep curl you're doing it for a set
of 25 and you're getting close to
failure and someone's like oh burn right
you're like yeah in my forearms
not in my biceps bad news maybe not the
greatest exercise in the world
many many sets of it don't get you a
really good pump okay you know it's a
really good exercise when you do two or
three sets and your
shit is blown up completely if you've
done like eight sets of
these weird flies you're trying on a
bosu ball or something and someone's
like your pecs really pumped up you're
like
no matter of fact they'd probably be
this pumped if i did three sets of
regular flies like holy shit that is not
a candidate for a good exercise
after many sets the target muscle isn't
much weaker there's not a local fatigue
because look if you're
really stimulating a target muscle a ton
it should get weaker over many sets
if something's happening to it and after
the workout
if there's no soreness at all maybe it's
not the greatest exercise now of course
none of these by themselves
is a big deal if you do five sets of an
amazing exercise and you don't get sore
that doesn't mean it doesn't cause
muscle growth maybe it did maybe a lot
maybe the most
but if an exercise really doesn't cause
a lot of tension doesn't cause a lot of
burn doesn't cause a lot of pump and
doesn't get you sore
after the workout gee whiz you know it's
not really clear it's doing a whole lot
you probably feel like it's not that's
probably correct
next when an exercise causes tons of
fatigue and maybe it actually trains you
pretty well
but the rating of perceived exertion is
massive you're super tired after it
interferes with the rest of your
training
it just takes heaven and earth to do and
you get something out of it but maybe
not an incredible
incredibly good trade-off the stimulus
may be good but the fatigue is so high
the ratio of stimulus to fatigue is just
not great
maybe it's not the world's best exercise
right someone's like hey you're gonna
get a huge back doing rack deadlifts
and you do rack deadlifts it just fries
the fuck out of you it feels like you're
fighting a lion every time and someone's
like
feel out in your back you're like yeah
but i feel just as much with bent rows
or with regular deadlifts and i don't
get us tired
maybe the rack deadlifts for you for you
not for everyone is not the best
exercise in the world
and lastly when it just doesn't seem to
improve much over time
you've been like doing hack squats for
months and months and months and your
hack squats just aren't going up the ton
your leg presses are going like crazy
squats are going up when you put it into
other exercises
they improve but this exercise just
doesn't seem to improve when you do it
over time maybe it's not the best
candidate
for actually being an effective exercise
because if it's effective it should be
making itself stronger over time
and thus it should be going up over time
if an exercise doesn't really move the
needle
then maybe it's not the best exercise in
the world
now that's all the stuff that can make
exercise for you in a specific situation
not the greatest thing ever
what about what makes an exercise good
it's actually a much shorter list
when it causes limited or no joint and
connective tissue pain
when there's a killer tension and or
burn to the target muscle
like if you're doing a kind of bicep
curl and you're like oh my fuck my
biceps are going to blow
out of my arms that's a real good thing
and if your elbows feel good during that
time
holy shit you found yourself a good
exercise and
with volumes not being so high
especially if you first started doing
the exercise
two three or four sets of the exercise
if they cause nasty pumps
tons of local fatigue they could do
three sets of squats and someone's like
are your legs tired
i don't think i can get up i someone
needs to call 911 to get my ass home
i can't use my legs anymore that's a
good sign of a really effective exercise
if you do 10 sets of some shit you can
jump up and down after
maybe it's not that great and if you get
crazy soreness like you do
you do a dumbbell flies properly for the
first time ever with a deep stretch
you do two sets of that shit and you're
like oh i feel okay two days later
you're like ah
ah what the hell happened to my pecs
like something definitely happened some
damage was
caused damage maybe not directly causing
hypertrophy but it sure as hell was
caused by a high degree of tension
metabolites which themselves do cause
hypertrophy
so when basically the real tldr on this
is if an exercise can be feel real good
on your joints and connective tissues
but can
fuck your muscles in the ass it's a good
thing that's probably a real good thing
right in addition to that if an exercise
causes relatively little systemic
fatigue or rp requirement
like you can get a real good chest
workout doing like decline bench
putting four plates on that shit and
having this really low range of motion
super fucking hard it's hard to
stabilize
you gotta fucking arch and retract and
it takes like a ton of like effort to
just like psych up for these big loads
you know your chest like gets a good
stimulus and everything's fine or
you can try just as an example i'll get
to the point where why all this is
individual anyway
just as an example if you do deficit
push-ups someone puts a 25-pound plane
on your back and holds it there gently
you do push-ups to like between blocks
or between dip stands or something
and you get this crazy big stretch it
doesn't feel like the sets are very hard
you finish you set and you're like i
don't know i feel a little tired like
systemically but i feel still
really strong but your pecs are blown up
like crazy to get super sore
you know maybe it's the same stimulus
for each one but the fatigue is way
lower for that
you know for the deficit push-ups and
then
because it's less systemic fatigue it
poisons the rest of your program less
it's a better exercise right because
remember yeah stimulus is ultimately
what we're going for
but fatigue matters if for noaa the
reason that if you get tons of fatigue
it interferes with other shit you know
do you want big back or big biceps well
if you choose the right back and bicep
exercises
you can have big both because if you do
back exercises that really fuck you up
systemically
your bicep training later might be just
like what like sending it in or just
like i don't know i'm mailing in this
bicep exercises bullshit
like i'm not getting out of this because
i'm so fucked up but if you do really
good back exercises that have a huge
stimulus
but low fatigue then after your back
workout later that day or just that
later that session you can get
really awesome bicep work and get both
so fatigue matters it's not just
stimulus
and lastly if an exercise checks a bunch
of these boxes
and gives you great higher strength
gains in whatever rep rate you're
working over months and months it's a
good thing
like if the leg press pumps up your
quads makes them sore all that stuff
you're just adding 10 pounds every week
for like 16 weeks straight
holy shit it's really difficult for
someone to say like that's not a good
exercise for your quads like really
my quads are stimulated like shit my
joints feel fine and i've put 150 pounds
on this exercise
for over the last year of training it
man that's a good sign you keep going
you know you can only leg press so you
know so much weight with small quads at
some point
if you started leg pressing at 300
pounds and eventually you're like
pressing 450 with the same technique
you will have bigger quads it is a good
exercise so all those are good
checklists
now if you find a really good exercise
and it's your best exercise for say
quads or chest or biceps or forearms or
whatever
can it be your best forever
can that exercise always be your best
well you can rank order all of your
exercises
on stimulus to fatigue ratio the ones
that stimulate the most fatigue the
least you put towards the top
you have your number one sfr exercise
two three four et cetera all the way
down you can do this for every muscle
group at any one point
and then you will have a best exercise
for that muscle group say okay quads
high bar squat with a belt definitely
the best stimulus to fatigue ratio for
me you know
maybe the same for you just as an
example but
with months of training that best
exercise because duh you're going to
want to do that exercise a lot as
the you know dominant exercise in your
program or at least one of them
training stainless happens an exercise
has a high sfr
at first and then as you train it more
and more the you actually learn how to
do
a better technique with it you find the
groove and your stimulus fatigue ratio
actually starts
rising and then after a few months in
many cases
it starts falling again because it gets
stale your joints start to get a little
worn down in that particular movement
it starts to get really boring your
pumps aren't there as much your tension
perception isn't there
the exercise gets stale fatigue goes up
stimulus goes down and thus the stimulus
to fatigue ratio of that previously
highest sfr exercise here's like two
three four five six it starts to fall
it starts to fall and at some point
another exercise
will have a irs fr so you'll do high bar
squats for months and months and months
that's just a simple example of just one
exercise
and then someone's like hey why don't
you do hack squats you're like yeah the
sfr is not that great you're like well
is your sfr for hybrid squats great like
it used to be
but lately it's been like man like my
joints are kind of feeling it i feel
like i'm trying really hard but the
tension in the muscle isn't that high
let's try hack squats you try hack
squats and holy fucking shit
i am pumped like crazy the tension is
unreal
my joints feel great i'm super excited
about this this is awesome
now hack squats are above hyper squats
and now it's a good idea to switch more
of your training
to hack squats in that case because they
have a higher sfr
and good news getting away from more
squatting doing less squatting and more
hack squatting in this case
actually resensitizes your squat because
the longer you don't do something
the more it all sort of fixes itself and
then after a while
the stimulus to fatigue ratio of your
high bar squat is rising so as you do
hack squats at first when you start them
they're a little bit better than hybrid
squats
and as you do them they rise and then
they fall so
six months later your hack squat is down
to back to normal levels and falling but
this entire time your high bar squat has
been rising
so after six months you may make the
switch again to where high bar squats
are now better again
than your hack squats and if you throw
leg presses and maybe lunges into the
mix or
you know pendulum squats or belt squats
you can rotate exercises
every few months as they rise and fall
in sfr
as soon as they're not the dominant
exercise in sfr you trade them out for
something better
that means that you can have great
training well
sort of forever but you can never truly
say
that any one exercise is your best
exercise
people will say like so what's your
favorite exercise this is the question i
fucking hate
i know i'll see some of you
motherfuckers on instagram you ask me
this is a joke
see there you know what's your favorite
exercise for back
what's your favorite exercise for legs
like i have dog shit answers that are
only partially correct
which is to say the exercise that's the
most often highest sfr
but at any one point if you see videos
of me training you'd be like so you said
camber
were your favorite back exercise but
here i see you doing dumbbell rows or
here i see you do barbara rose why
it's because camber borrows are
currently not my best because their sfr
is low because of stainless now they'll
be back eventually
but it's not even true to say that for
anyone individual there is a best
exercise
there's a candidacy group of a top three
to five exercises that are always the
best
but it's not true to say that it's just
number one the best it is ridiculous to
say there's a best exercise for chest
for an individual as it is to say you
have a truly favorite food
because you fucking don't you may think
you do but you eat that shit for three
or four weeks straight
you'll fucking hate it or at best you'll
be like i can't do any more pizza i know
it sounds crazy but try eating pizza
fucking maybe don't try eating pizza for
three weeks straight
but if you do you might just not be in a
pizza and then you go to that same
italian place and you order pasta and
someone catches you like i thought you
said pizza was your favorite like
yes it was until i ate too much pizza
now i want pasta right
same exact idea here so when people say
like
exercise you must do or everyone's going
to benefit
that's not true even for the individual
it gets worse
individual differences matter between
individuals there's even less common
ground
for what can be considered a best
exercise people ask me what i think the
best exercises are for quads and i give
my usual list
that may not be true for everyone or
even most other people why
because other people have different
muscle shapes they have different
pinnation angles of insertion at their
muscles
they have different limb ratios limb
lengths fiber types
and nervous system operations so that a
great exercise for one lifter the high
bar squat for me because i'm built
almost ideally for that shit
can be a terrible exercise for another
lifter if you have really long femurs
if you're not super flexible in your
lower body and if you have a really
short torso the high bar squat is going
to be straight
dog shit for your quads i know it's
crazy it's my favorite exercise but it's
true how do you know what the best
exercise is for you
only an individual evaluation of your
stimulus to fatigue ratio
which if you want the technical answer
just type in stimulus to fatigue ratios
retell into youtube
and a video will come up where i talk
about the entire concept but the real
quick thing is
is it causing a ton of tension is it
causing a burn is it causing a pump is
it getting you a little sore
and is it easy on your joints is it easy
on your
uh performance for other exercises and
doesn't beat you up a whole lot
systemically
if an exercise is pretty easy to pull
off but it gets your ton of stimulus
your stimulus to fatigue ratio is high
myself any other youtuber can't tell you
you're doing the exercise that you're
not supposed to be doing
if someone says look lateral raises are
dog shit with adults you pick up lateral
raises
and after a few weeks you're getting a
fucking crazy pump and tension in your
shoulders
no joint pain remotely you're getting
more and more reps every time and
actually having to use the heavier
dumbbells
who the fuck is going to tell you
lateral raises are a bad idea for side
delts what the fuck
like your side delts literally gets sore
every other session
and they get huge pump and you can't
even raise your shoulder to brush your
teeth later at night
really who's going to tell you it's a
bad exercise for you it's a good
exercise
for now until and unless after several
months it becomes stale then you switch
it up
to another exercise right so from one
person
there's no best exercise for multiple
people there's for sure no best exercise
which is why this is a huge
huge dog shit myth now some exercises
even for a population of people tend to
have better average stimulus to fatigue
ratios which is why when people ask me
hey what quad exercises should i be
doing
i say try high bar squats hack squats
leg presses belt squats
and uh pendulum or lever squats
our lunges in the mix sure but there's
some glute not as good of quad
leg extensions great tool in some cases
but really don't produce
super high forces because you're not
it's not a compound pushing movement
it's just an extension
so it has its utility i wouldn't put it
in the top five now are some people leg
extensions their best exercise for sure
but for most people you're gonna find a
very rare person
that doesn't respond really well to at
least a few of those top five exercises
and
what about like bosu ball one-legged
squats how many people
is that for them the best quad exercise
maybe zero maybe one or two ever
so some exercises really are worse for
almost everyone it's kind of like saying
you know what's your favorite food is it
a taco bell burrito
or is it like the finest french dining
that i of course make because i'm a
french chef you guys remember that video
you know all most people would say it's
fine uh french dining
and some you know relatively rare people
would say a taco bell burrito is the
best which i i personally agree i would
much rather have a taco bell burrito
than stupid
fucking fancy french food so there's no
saying this food is better than the
other necessarily
but like if you throw in a piece of dog
shit into the mix and be like all right
french food taco bell burrito or dog
shin someone's like well it just kind of
depends bro some people like dogs who
the fuck likes dog shit
or your dog might he shifts it out and
eats it i've seen dogs do that it's
really fucked up you know dogs are
satanic animals when they eat their own
shit but in any case
like a piece of dog shit socks for
almost everyone so it's okay to say look
don't do don't eat dog shit it's bad and
it's okay to say like don't do bosu ball
squats with
one leg in the air and one leg up your
ass because it's probably not a good
quad exercise
but when you say things like this is the
best exercise or this exercise is for
sure terrible for everyone and that
exercise you're talking about is an
exercise that works for a lot of people
then you're in the wrong then you're in
that youtube bullshit club and you're
saying some shit that's not true
all right so how do you choose the best
exercises
for yourself because this is all nobody
gives a shit theoretically about all
this crap
it's all coming coming down to the
individual what's best for you well
you can take the allegedly best
exercises that some of these youtubers
with all good intentions
um are saying are the best and just
assume
charitably that they mean best average
stimulus to fatigue ratios for a
population
try them for a mesocycle evaluate their
stimulus to fatigue ratio
while you're doing that you want to make
the technique on them yours
so some some people say do lateral
raises like this some people say like
that
some people say like this some people
say that way try all the methods try the
method they recommended first
but then if you notice that if you put
your pinkies down a little bit or if you
put them up a little bit
then you actually get a better sensation
if you're squatting they said squat with
your feet like this
you try it like this you try it like
that you try it like this
figure out slowly which method is best
to get your stimulus higher and your
fatigue lower and then you can make the
exercise yours
which is to say you can really give it
uh as much of due diligence as you can
you're really steel manning the exercise
you don't want to refute it you want
effective exercises so you want to
tailor the exercise a bit more
to where it's maximally effective for
you if
after all that tailoring which usually
takes a few weeks if the sfr is starting
to climb it gets really high and it's
really good exercise
fucking sweet you found a gem keep it in
keep doing it until the sfr is low from
stainless and then you can replace it
however you can also do this for
exercises that a lot of social media
influencers
say might not be a good idea or don't
recommend right or that they say is a
bad idea
so when people say like don't do upright
rows it's nuclear death for your
shoulders
okay heed that wisdom but maybe try some
light upright rows try it with a bit of
a different technique
and you may find that when a certain
range of motion sometimes a very high
one
shit just fucking blows up your side
belts blows up your traps it feels great
on your elbows it's not super high
effort and you're like
i'm just gonna keep doing this and work
with your grip grip here here here
find a grip that works to minimize joint
discomfort and maximize muscle
activation
and all of a sudden six months later you
built way bigger shoulders doing upright
rows whenever cocksucker on youtube
and their mom says they're bad for you
guess what you're not more jacked than
they are you're definitely more jacked
than their mom
do what's right for you experiment slow
and steady always known in the stimulus
fatigue ratio never assume a single
exercise is bad
or single exercise is good it's whatever
works for you
folks i've ranted myself into an early
grave
see you next time
