hey folks Dr Mike here from Renaissance
periodization and today's the BS topic
is that Stevia is safer than other
artificial sweeteners
wait that's BS yes yes it sure is all
right
so first of all
is it Stevia or Stevia
me I'm saying stevian here's why it's a
make-believe word so we can pronounce it
however we want I guess all words are
make believe Stevie doesn't really have
a anthropology associated with an
ethnography of the word I assume doesn't
exist but if it's Stevia sorry but also
not sorry because that sounds like I'm
talking about some guy named Steve you
know what if your name is Steve and
you're listening to this certainly there
are hundreds of you statistically named
Steve listening to this
um I don't want you to be implicated in
what I'm about to say so it's Stevia and
if your name is stev you got it coming
Point number one lots of people claim
that Stevia is the safer sweetener it's
healthier than aspartame and Sucralose
and a bunch of the others
if you look at the actual Health Data
the direct scientific research there is
zero support of this and as far as I
could find
and in fact much more research later
couldn't could actually prove that
Stevia is safer but that research
doesn't yet exist
so we're
there's a notion that stavier is
healthier it is not even couched as a
hypothesis it's not even cautious guess
it's it's a thing we just know to be
true which is a note
number three point here is on short-term
gut health
Stevia is actually in at least one study
has been shown to be worse than
aspartame oh and uh the PubMed link is
right there in the study if you want to
copy it down
write it down in your notebook
Pro tip if you're watching this on your
phone just pause the screen zoom in and
your phone will be able to uh
if you screenshot it and go to the
picture of that it'll be able to just
highlight that right up go right into
Pub and read that study
so
in this
study Stevia had some pretty large
changes on gut microbiota also again
probably not concerning you got
microbiome is insanely adaptive
but Aspartame is essentially undetected
in exchange
so of all of the health data we do have
we have this tiny little piece in which
Stevie is actually worse than aspartame
which is supposed to be the silent
killer of a generation
so if there's not really a lot of
evidence or actually any evidence at all
actually you know the margins negative
evidence for Stevia being healthier and
safer for you than other artificial
sweeteners or castevia is a natural
sweetener oh
Stevie is a non-nutriff sweetener which
means it basically has no calories just
like sucralose and aspartame but those
two and the many others they're
artificially constructed and designed in
a laboratory where estevia comes
directly from Mother Earth uh herself
why the love for Stevia because it's
natural and that's literally it it's
just pure bias it is the argument from
nature fallacy or the naturalistic
fallacy however you say it it's that
folks do not fall for this crap go by
Logic and evidence do not go by what
feels right because that's actually just
called Prejudice and bias and it's maybe
wrong
stop telling people Stevia is safer and
healthier just because it's natural
there's tons of natural stuff that's bad
for you like snake bite and just merely
existing outdoors and there's tons of
artificial stuff that's really good for
you like air conditioning and wow the
warmth of a TV dinner in your hands
isn't that nice I don't hold it too long
it'll burn you
any case there's one guy that it's like
digging the fitness industry and it's
like a movie star he said something
about Stevia once that I thought was
like it was just really
It's really informative you know someone
just says something you're like man you
really just summed it up oh and it was
Arnold and he said see you guys
next time let me tell you guys about the
RP hypertrophy app with over 28 preset
programs already in the app you could
choose to make your own you could modify
an existing program or you could just
run the programs exactly as they were
written by me personally this app
programs everything for you exercises

thing after every single workout on
every single week the app adjusts to
your unique parameters with every single
input we have over 250 exercises in the
app with detailed video tutorial links
to every single one you never have to be
confused about technique or form ever
again I'm guessing right now you're
pretty interested in the app download
