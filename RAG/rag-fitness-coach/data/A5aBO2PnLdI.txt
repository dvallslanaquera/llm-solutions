low testosterone levels can be one of
the worst things for males you're more
depressed you're shy from
competition do you know as an actor that

testosterone part of the Reel you do
like a curtain call or whatever and
they're like we need someone pathetic
looking to suck on camera like well it's
exactly up my alley also if you wear a
turtleneck you for sure have low
testosterone having high levels of
testosterone feel it feels very good oh
finally finally it happened to me I'm at
a shady Hotel pool hitting on Hired Guns
Scott rank these quick I mean
they're all tens from the back tens from
the
back look at how healthy and fertile I
am by subconsciously flashing you my
entire grill ah
