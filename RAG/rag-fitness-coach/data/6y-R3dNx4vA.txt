even if you straight up ignore
everything else okay every other little
muscle building nutrition tip and all
these other youtube videos that you find
and you just focus on these three things
you will build muscle at or near your
maximum potential
not to mention that it's going to make
your life a hell of a lot simpler in the
process as well
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and today we're
talking about effective muscle building
nutrition
and specifically we're going to cut
through the bs and boil things down to
the three most important steps that you
need to follow okay the three
nutritional steps that truly matter in
the real world and that are going to be
responsible for the vast majority of
your gains
now nutrition is a subject that can be
overanalyzed and over complicated to
death and that's exactly what so many of
these experts here on youtube try to do
they give you
a million different little guidelines
and hacks that you supposedly must
follow in order to get results and all
it does is confuse people
create more dietary anxiety and make the
process that much more
difficult and a lot of the time these
experts don't even truly understand the
terms they're using in the first place
and they're basically just reading them
off a teleprompter in order to sound
intelligent
ketones are also what is called a
histone d-acetylase
inhibitor insulin is anti-catabolic
because it decreases what is called the
ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activity
that's just simple that just has to do
with something called the s-glute one
transporter a20 directly prevents the
modulation
of nuclear factor kappa b so check this
out first of all you throwing too many
big words at me
okay now because i don't understand them
i'm going to take them as disrespect
foods you must eat foods you must avoid
foods you must combine foods you must
never combine
the perfect macronutrient ratio the
exact time of day to eat
the times of day when you must never eat
etc etc etc it sounds compelling
um that this stuff is delivered using
the right terminology and
supposed scientific references but in
reality most of this stuff is just
unnecessary over complication
and the more complicated you make things
the higher your chances for long-term
failure are going to be
because the less likely it'll be that
you'll actually stick to your diet long
term
not to mention that it will just make
your day-to-day life a more stressful
experience because you're constantly
trying to micromanage every little thing
that you consume
the goal should be to make things only
as complex as they absolutely
need to be before i dive into it if you

out to more people so that they can get
the proper guidance they need as well
and it also keeps me motivated to keep
on producing this free content so
spank that like button and let's get
started okay number one on the list the
most important factor for effective
muscle building nutrition
is consuming sufficient protein yes i
know that's not
the groundbreaking advice that most
people want to hear it's not very
exciting
but this here isn't about giving people
what they want to hear it's about giving
them what they actually
need to hear okay number one is protein
now if your goal is to lose body fat
then total calories would be the number
one factor because you can't lose fat
without being in a calorie deficit but
when it comes to muscle growth
technically it is possible to build
muscle whether you're in a calorie
deficit or a calorie surplus as long as
you have a proper training stimulus in
place
and you're eating enough protein and so
that's why i would consider protein
as the primary factor if there's one
thing you absolutely must do
it's to consume enough high quality
protein to support muscle recovery and
growth and fortunately this is actually
pretty easy to do i've mentioned this
guideline
a million times before but around 0.8
grams of protein per pound of body
weight each day
is all you're going to need to gain
muscle at your full potential if you
want to go higher than that just out of
preference that's totally fine
but 0.8 grams is a safe minimum when it
comes to maximizing your gains
and as long as you're basing uh your
main meals around some sort of central
protein source like most people already
do
you know a basic protein and carb
pairing and then maybe some optional
vegetables
are optional healthy fats depending on
how you're choosing to lay things out
if you're doing that then hitting that
0.8 gram figure is usually
pretty easy to do for a 125 pound person
that's 100 grams of protein daily
for 150 pounds it's 120 grams 175 pounds
is 140 grams and then 200 pounds would
be 160 grams
and since protein needs are technically
based on lean mass
if you're more on the overweight side
then you can go even lower at around 0.7
or even 0.6 grams per pound of body
weight
depending on just how much body fat
you're carrying and if hitting those
numbers is difficult for you for
whatever
reason then you can just add some
protein powder in to very easily
increase your protein intake you know if
you're having
one to two scoops of protein powder a
day in combination with your regular
solid food sources then hitting that 0.8
gram figure should not be a problem at
all
for me i just put one scoop in my
oatmeal in the morning and then one
scoop in my yogurt at night combine that
with
two solid food sources during the day
and getting enough protein is a complete
non-issue
forget about all these crazy guidelines
some people give you telling you that
you have to consume
250 or 300 grams plus of protein per day
at least 40
of your calories have to come from
protein i drink a shitload of shakes i
do three sometimes four shakes a day
if you want to consume that much and it
fits into your total calories then
that's fine
but it's not a must and we've got plenty
of data now to support
uh that more moderate protein intakes
are enough to maximize protein synthesis
and we have more than enough real world
evidence for this as well
now keep in mind that you can only
stimulate protein synthesis up to a
certain limit after
a single protein feeding and so for the
very best results you ideally don't want
to be lumping all of your protein down
into one single meal but this usually is
not an issue
since very very few people would even
want to do that in the first place
i'd say that two separate protein
feedings per day should be the minimum
some people who are doing intermittent
fasting might fall into that category
and that for fully optimal muscle
building nutrition you should try to
space your protein out into three or
more individual feedings
now total protein intake for the day as
a whole is by far the most important
thing so
even if you did only eat one single meal
or two meals you're still going to
achieve great results don't get me wrong
but if maximum muscle growth is your
goal then go for three or more
separate protein feedings per day so
that you're stimulating protein
synthesis multiple
times from there the rest of your
macronutrient breakdown is really just
going to be a matter of personal
preference
there's no magical carb to fat ratio
that you must follow
you know if you want to eat a bit more
carbs and a bit less fat or a bit more
fat and a bit less carbs that's fine
as long as the total calorie content is
the same then
the specific way that you lay your
macronutrients out is not going to
matter at the end of the day
just make sure that you're getting in
enough protein trying to micromanage
things down to the exact macro is
totally unnecessary for most people
it'll just create more stress and
increase the chances for dietary burnout
okay if you want to roughly estimate
that's fine
but as long as the total protein is
there then the rest should just be laid
out based on your own individual
preference
and by the way if you're tired of all
the confusing and conflicting nutrition

all right step number two
involves calories once again nothing
special or groundbreaking here
but what we're doing here is simplifying
things down to what truly matters in the
real world and not just over
complicating things
for the sake of it now like i said
before if you're eating enough protein
and you're training properly and your
calories aren't excessively low
then whether you're in a deficit or a
surplus you're still ultimately going to
gain muscle to some
degree gaining muscle in a deficit is
especially
doable if you're starting out more on
the overweight side and you've got a lot
of stored fat
that can be used as extra muscle
building fuel or if you're a beginner
and weight training is a novel stimulus
or if you are a more experienced lifter
and you're returning from a training
layoff however if your body fat is
already within a low to moderate range
and you're past that newbie phase then
you do need to be in a calorie surplus
if your goal is to put on muscle and
gain strength at your maximum potential
yes you can still gain muscle at
maintenance or in a deficit to some
extent
even if you are more experienced but
just because you can gain muscle in a
deficit it doesn't mean that it's going
to be optimal and i think a lot of
people
overlook that you know they just hear
this idea that you can gain muscle
without a surplus
and they just take it at face value
without considering that yes you can
gain muscle without a surplus
but with a surplus you're going to gain
muscle more effectively
if you're training hard in the gym and
you're trying to pack overall size and
strength onto your frame at the fastest
rate
you need those extra calories to enhance
your recovery and give your body
all the raw materials that it needs to
build muscle at its maximum potential
you are not going to build muscle at
your maximum potential
if you're in a deficit and you're
already relatively lean however
just like with protein you really don't
need that much okay you don't need a
huge surplus where you're force feeding
yourself all day long
and slamming weight gain shakes and
trying to cram in extra calories at
every possible opportunity
[Applause]
200 to 300 calories above maintenance
per day is enough to gain muscle at your
full potential
and as i've said so many times before
going beyond that amount is not
necessary and it's actually
counterproductive
because the extra calories are just
going to be stored as fat now 200 to 300
calories is obviously not a huge amount
so you don't necessarily need to be
tracking this precisely you know for a
lot of people out there
the weight training that they do is just
going to naturally spike their appetite
up a bit
and then they'll just automatically eat
a bit more during the day without even
really thinking about it and as long as
they don't go overboard on total
calories
they'll still consistently gain muscle
without putting on excessive fat and
without having to
specifically track their calories
however the main point here is to just
be aware
that if you want to gain muscle
optimally you do need to be eating in a
calorie surplus and that that calorie
surplus should be relatively modest
to prevent excessive fat gain you
shouldn't be putting on any more than
about
two to three pounds per month at the
most and about half that amount for
females
if your progress has stalled um you're
not gaining body weight your strength is
plateaued in the gym
then it means that you're not in a
calorie surplus and you need to bump
your food intake up slightly
and as a side note if you're not putting
on weight and you're finding it hard to
get in
all the calories that you need each day
aside from just eating more food
in general one simple thing you can do
is to just increase your fat intake
fats have more than twice the caloric
value of protein and carbs and they have
the lowest
thermic effect as well and so adding in
some more fat to your diet is a very
easy way to bump your calories up
without having to consume very large
volumes of food
nuts nut butters seeds healthy oils
coconut
oil dark chocolate these are all really
good sources that you can add in for
some easy extra calories
and if you want to get some ideas in
terms of calculating your current
calorie maintenance level then i'll link
an older video of mine
down in the description box which
explains how you can get an initial
starting point in place for yourself

so far and you're new to the channel

loop on all of my future uploads
and lastly we've got point number three
the third muscle building nutrition
guideline on the list
this is just something that i recommend
in general to anybody on a fitness plan
of any kind just for the sake of optimal
overall health and performance
and that is to base the bulk of your
diet around nutrient dense
minimally processed whole foods you
don't need to obsess over this idea
of eating clean 24 7. okay you can still
have your favorite treat foods in
moderation
you can still have cheat meals or even
full cheat days here and there as long
as you don't go overboard
but the majority of your diet try to get
that from whole foods
there are no individual foods you must
eat there are no
muscle building superfoods okay none of
that nonsense just focus on whatever
minimally processed whole foods you most
prefer i mean if you do sign up for the
custom program over at shawnell.com
custom i'll provide you with a sample
meal plan and a list of foods that you
can use as a reference
now if your primary goal is fat loss
then this guideline is especially
important because whole foods are going
to help to keep you satiated while
you're in a calorie deficit but for most
people who are actively focusing on
gaining muscle and they're eating in a
surplus generally that isn't going to be
a big factor it might be for some people
but the main reason for this guideline
for eating whole foods
is to make sure that you're getting in
the fiber and the vitamins and the
minerals that you need
for maximum health and performance and
recovery
and as an estimation something like 80
to 90 percent
clean food and then 10 to 20 treat food
that's a good
realistic breakdown that will cover all
of your general health needs
while giving you the dietary flexibility
to live a normal life and enjoy your
favorite foods and go out and
you know have a restaurant meal with
your friends without worrying about it
maybe have a few drinks here and there
if you desire okay you don't need to be
perfect with your nutrition that's only
going to create
unnecessary stress and it's not going to
get you better results anyway
and if you want to fully round this out
and make sure that your micronutrient
needs and your omega-3 needs are being
fully met
then i would recommend checking out
microcore and o3 prime
these are from my sports nutrition line
real science athletics and i personally
use them every day to make sure that my
nutrition is 100
on point microcore is our multivitamin
that was tailored specifically to hard
training lifters
with the most important vitamins and
minerals they require in the highest
quality forms and optimal dosages
and then o3 prime is our re-esterified
triglyceride fish oil which is the
highest quality form you can get
to ensure that your epa and dha levels
are in the ideal range and these are two
compounds that have
pretty much an endless list of different
benefits in the body so this is a really
solid pairing to round out your overall
eating plan

the question of how to eat
to gain muscle effectively as unsexy as
those steps might be
they really are the main things that you

consume enough daily protein eat in a
small calorie surplus
and base your diet mainly around
minimally processed whole foods that is
the
vast vast majority of the nutrition side
of things
right there i'm not saying that those
are the only contributing factors and
that you can't tweak things further
and experiment a bit to find what is
absolutely ideal for you as an
individual
but no matter how you slice it these are
the primary factors that are going to be
responsible for the vast majority of
your results
