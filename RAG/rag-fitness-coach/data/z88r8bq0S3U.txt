supplements and hydration muscle gain
dining made simple video number five
i'm dr mike for renaissance
periodization let's get right into it
so all videos one through four got us
really awesome baseline plan
and we're just about ready to start
learning how to manipulate our macros
and calories of course to gain muscle
but before we start
what about supplements and hydration
people talk about them a lot
hypothetically hydration is very
important
should we really be concerned with these
things and if we are to what extent
let's get through this i'll tell you
right now there's not a lot to this
firstly because supplements just don't
do a lot there are a couple of
supplements that are worth your look
that may very well help the actual
muscle gain process
first is whey protein it can be used
as an intra or post workout with
potentially some carbs
it is a small effect if you're eating
enough protein over the day whey protein
is really unnecessary
but it may offer small advantages
especially if you're having trouble
choking real food
down whey protein is highly anabolic and
is a great protein source to put in like
meal replacements and stuff like that
carb powders gatorade powerade vitargo
all those other carb powders they can be
taken intra during or post workout
because they're simple they're super
high glycemic
and they're very easy to eat if you're
having trouble pushing a ton of food
carb powders can be a big advantage
and that's their primary advantage in
muscle gaining
uh this is especially true if you're
having sort of maybe not digestive
problems but there's just it's a lot of
food
and uh you know let's say you eat three
hours before your workout
and it comes time to work out and you're
still feeling full if you eat half the
food you usually do
same amount of protein same amount of
fats but half the carbs three hours
before
and then maybe half an hour before you
slam like 25 or 50 migs whatever or
milligrams good god
um grams of you know say gatorade powder
or power rate over target or something
like that
30 minutes later you're gonna have an
amazing workout with a super great pump
but because those carbs are so easy to
digest and so rapidly digesting
you're not gonna feel that burden of
like oh god i'm gonna throw up from all
these carbs that i had a little while
ago so
something to definitely think about in
addition to that some people after a
really hard training session
can't eat until like an hour later much
better to get some whey protein and some
of these really glycemic carbs down the
hatch immediately after training
drive home and a lot of them have such a
high glycemic index that they make
go through a cycle of rebound
hypoglycemia they go in the blood so
fast you get a big insulin secretion
and then the blood sugar drops and then
you're super hungry again so have one of
these
shakes on the way home from the gym when
you get home take a shower your dirty
bastard when you get out of the shower
you'll be like oh you know what i'm
actually really ready to eat by the time
you put your food together you're really
ready to eat and then it goes down
awesomely
because if you really just wait an hour
you go home you shower and then you sit
down to have your food
that's an hour of eating you could have
done an hour eating of eating you've
missed
and that's a really anabolic hour
post-workout it's not like crazy special
but it sets up a lot of good things
later
so if you need carb powders and protein
powders to do that i do it all the time
it works really really well
it might work well as well for you what
about mass gainers well here's the thing
mass gainers
are almost always a minimum amount of
fats a ton of these glycemic carbs
and a bunch of protein per the most of
which the majority of which tends to be
whey protein
so it's kind of like our first two
categories here combined to form mass
gainers
here's the thing about mass gainers
they're really good for like pre
or during or post workout to just smash
the calories and make it so you
you can tolerate eating the amount of
food you have the rest of the day
and still not like be throwing up all
over yourself or just quitting the mass
gaining process
for folks that have don't have a huge
appetite or maybe their digestive system
just isn't that powerful
they can get into a situation where they
just can't eat any more food
but the scale hasn't really moved up in
two weeks and like what the hell is
going on i need to eat more but i can't
that's when you take your regular food
that you are eating and you add mass
gainers on top of that
okay because a lot of people what they
think is mass gainers think two things
one
mass gainers can just replace your food
that's actually correct but
why if you can just eat whole food would
you take a mass gainer sometimes it's
cheaper and if that's the case
that's totally fine if you're lazy to
eat that's totally fine
but generally speaking just eat a normal
diet and
you don't have to replace your masking
or stuff something that's just something
you put on top of your regular diet you
squeeze in
to a pre-workout intro and post or maybe
just one of those three
to get a few more calories in without
just like throwing up all over the place
or quitting the diet
another thing people think about mass
gainers much more prevalent and much
obviously worse is a bit catastrophic
but
it's just inaccurate is that mass
gainers offer some kind of like
unique special independent pathway by
which to grow muscle so for example
if you're talking about like let's say
anabolic steroids
food and stuff makes you grow just
eating normal food
anabolic steroids take all that food
you're eating and the rest of your body
processes
and make them grow more muscle even
still by completely different pathways
right
however a mass gainer if you're eating
enough food
it doesn't do anything more than this
food all mass gainer can do is if you're
supposed to be eating this much food but
you can only eat this
a mass gainer can easily more easily get
you up to here
that's it so like i i you know back in
the day i've trained with a few folks
who'd be like hey man i'm going to start
a masking or what do you think i'm like
you're not going to get these drug-like
effects out of it it's not special it's
just more food
but if more food is something you can't
really do
mass gainer is a really good idea some
people like needlessly poo poo them like
you don't need a masking or just eat
whole food
or a mass gainer right if you can't eat
any more whole food
mass gainers go down super super easy
they digest really quickly generally
speaking and they're a really good
option they're just an option in context
and they're not magic they're not going
to revolutionize your body it's just a
little tool to use that's pretty effect
that's it creatine creatine works really
well builds muscle really well
i would started a week before your gain
phase that your weight can plateau out
because you'll gain something like an
average of five pounds just in that
first week of creatine loading into your
muscle cells
uh it will temporarily increase your
weight and when you stop taking creatine
your weight will fall off
right you didn't lose any muscle you
just lost body water inside your muscles
here's what you don't want to do you
don't want to start your muscle gain
phase and start tracking and
manipulating calories and start creating
any time during that time
because what will happen is your body
will go up by like five pounds oh my god
i'm gaining weight this is great you'll
be like oh my god i'm getting way too
fast i got to reduce my calories
remember that's body water
it doesn't say anything about your
tissue so start creatine a week before
then start tracking measuring and you'll
have a stable baseline okay
so that's just the only thing with
creatine creation monohydrate is the
best most tested most reliable source
some of them work probably okay some of
them probably don't work at all like
cree alkaline probably doesn't do
anything
so creatine monohydrate optimum
nutrition's a fine brand
you get like a kilo of creatine about
hydrate powder for like
like 20 or something it lasted like a
year and a half
and uh you know timing isn't a really
big deal you can put in your workout
shake you can take it in the morning you
can take it at night
as long as you consistently take
creatine it doesn't matter what time of
the day you take it
creatine works by adding up inside your
muscle cells and then having a stable
baseline
above the normal amount it doesn't have
an acute effect
so it's like if you take creatine before
the workout you're like yes i'm superman
you won't feel anything it doesn't
increase performance the short term
four or five days after you start taking
creatine you're gonna have bigger palms
get more wraps and anabolism is gonna be
triggered better
stimulants stimulants can help
you power through really high demanding
muscle gain workouts they can
caffeine is the most common one of these
it's the main ingredient in pre-workout
so on and so forth
use as few of them as you need to power
through the workouts because here's the
thing on a fat loss phase you're running
on fumes stimulants are great
on a muscle gain phase you're running on
hundreds of grams of carbs you probably
don't need
a pre-workout and if you do just try to
use as little as possible
here's the thing watch your intake and
timing of these things because they can
mess up your sleep and sleep is so much
more important
even than how hard you train to your
muscle gain that you don't want to
fuck with fat in addition to that your
hunger levels remember stimulants
really for many people harshly reduce
hunger
and a lot of times these pre-workouts
that people sell the ones that come in
the scoop out of the container
each scoop is like an inordinate amount
of caffeine that really really drops
your hunger
what ends up happening is you take a
pre-workout you do your workout you get
home
your pre-workout's still well in your
blood and
you just don't eat a whole lot of food
you can't stuff yourself anymore like
you know you would before and all of a
sudden yeah you're having great workouts
but your overall calorie levels per day
are dipping
and you're not gaining as much muscle so
use these things judicially
understand their downsides and their
limitations
all right that's it for supplements are
there some other supplements that might
work guess we'll cover a few in just a
bit
but mostly that's it and most of the
other supplements just don't do much
or much enough to be worth the money or
scientifically we can't be sure of them
so we're not going to tell you to do
stuff that's not scientifically very
well satisfied
what about hydration a lot of people say
hydration's super important muscle
growth
bullshit hydration is important to keep
your ass alive
and that's really important for muscle
growth but beyond keeping you alive and
beyond keeping you performing well in
the gym hydration doesn't do
basically anything at all for muscle
growth so if you're peeing off yellow
relative
relatively frequently or if you're
peeing clear relatively frequently
then you're good to go there's no reason
to worry about anything before you have
a hard workout especially something like
legs you can have like you know anywhere
between eight and 32 ounces of some kind
of low calorie no calorie fluid
or some kind of water or something just
to top off a few hours before
to make sure you're internally hydrated
and you're good to go right
uh and and that's really it and you know
when you're thirsty during the workout
have drinks of water and throughout the
day just drink normally to thirst as
long as you're peeing
uh yellow or uh or sorry off yellow
almost clear or clear you're good to go
right
what about salt and water intake should
you track it
if you track your water intake and you
roughly normalize your salt intake
you can make sure to not mistake
waterway fluctuations for
muscle gain or muscle loss so for
example
because because fluid intake and
especially coupled with salt intake can
really throw off your body weight
results
if you go and have a cheat meal at
chinese buffet
and you the next day weigh five pounds
more okay that's not because the chinese
buffet gets you extra jacked although it
might
it's because you had so much salt at the
chinese buffet and you got so thirsty
drink so much water when you came home
that your muscles and your subcutaneous
space and everything else in your body
is just storing more water if you know
that that's the case if
let's say you had a week where you ate a
lot of junk food
and you gained a lot of weight that week
don't be like oh i got to ease up off
the calories
go back to your normal diet eat your
normal amounts of salt in your normal
roughly amounts of fluids and then
you'll realize that after four days of
that you lost almost all the weight you
gained if not all of it
like shit the reason i was so heavy
during that week for a few days
was because i was bloated off all the
salt and all this water right because
when you have high salt foods
your water intake automatically goes up
in most cases because you get thirstier
so if you know that you just know not to
get really itchy
when you you know have a ton of salt
water or for example
let's say this you know you had a big
week of cheating
and you were gaining pretty well or like
your body weight's looking really good
and then you go and you go back to your
normal intake and your body weight falls
a lot
don't after three days think oh shit
like i'm losing muscle i'm losing weight
because i'm so much lighter
give it a little bit give it a wee give
it to to see how that new lower salt and
water environment of mostly clean eating
does does you pretty well because after
two weeks you know first you might have
dipped down
but after two weeks you might be gone up
a little bit and then your calories are
good
so just know that so you don't get any
weirdness and make sort of the wrong
decisions or make hasty decisions for
that
for that matter in summary
there are no magic muscle gain
supplements other than the ones you get
from the eye of the trench coat behind
the gmc
and hit wink wink okay the usual
supplements whey protein creatine and
stuff
they work but they have to be used
diligently and they're not super
crazy revolutionary okay you don't have
to tell everyone you're on creatine at
the gym and expect them to be like holy
shit you're gonna be
you're gonna be like eating weights you
know tomorrow is crazy big as you're
going to get it's nothing revolutionary
you just do it over time and it makes
the results a tiny bit better
nothing beats food and no supplement
beats consistency of intake
the person that's going to be huge is
the guy that trains really hard and
consistently eats at a slight surplus
and eventually he's going to be massive
the guy that sort of eats at a slight
surplus sometimes sometimes at a deficit
sometimes the maintenance
and misses meals here and there but he's
like i got creatine nitro xos
i've got pre-workout psycho joker
edition i got
fucking mass gainer 5k 3d
g c abc that guy's probably going
nowhere i literally know
dozens of people like both of those guys
and the guys that eat consistently and
train hard are enormous now
and the guys that do all that other
bullshit and really over valley
supplements they went nowhere fast
right just to cover your nutrient base
as a multivitamin can be a good idea
better idea well a more needed idea when
you're cutting because you could have
some slight nutrient deficiencies not a
big deal with massing but it's a good
habit to have all the time
hydration is not a big deal just stay
regularly hydrated
uh with just like you know fluids with
your meals like get one of those mio
drink mix thingies and
get your shaker out and put in 32 ounces
of water or 28 or something
squirt a couple of shits in there mix it
up a little bit and then you have like a
really awesome flavored no calorie drink
that you drink with your
rice and chicken and pasta and stuff
like that and then voila you do that
with every meal and you're super well
hydrated and you have a little extra
fluid before you go to the gym
a bunch of fluid during the gym after
you have more fluid and that's it you're
good to go no reason to overthink the
stuff
that's all the basics in next video
video number six
we are going to take our current plan
that we have and make sure
that calorically it has a surplus
created
and we'll see you guys then so i'll see
you next week
