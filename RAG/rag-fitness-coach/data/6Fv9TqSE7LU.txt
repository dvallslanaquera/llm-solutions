hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today's quick tip
is on how to or not to use weed
for your recovery from hardcore training
the topic everybody wants to know about
and by everybody i mean potheads like
you
so
when we are 4 20 and it
4 20 is that a verb is it a date
april 20th
earth day something like that in any
case
weed has upsides and downsides as does
any other variable introduced into any
kind of system
here we go
upsides for weed as far as recovery from
training is concerned
first it helps you or can help you relax
big deal relaxation is a huge wellspring
of recovery awesome it basically
switches you to parasympathetic style
nervous system output and that really
sets up the stage for a ton of recovery
another thing is that wheat can help you
sleep which is a huge deal because sleep
is the most powerful recovery tool that
you have as a matter of fact
eating a high protein diet with plenty
of calories and then sleeping a lot
that combination is like the thing that
heals you and grows all your muscle
and
if appetite is not your thing and you
have trouble eating enough to put on
weight or to recover
then weed can help you eat which is a
big deal and potentially a really good
thing
now
as big of a smoker and toker as i am i
have to admit there are downsides
first downside is that
weed may wig you out either during or
sometime after you were high and it can
cause you to be nervous and paranoid and
all these other weird things and
speak to your ancestors that are angry
at you when you close your eyes every
time that that's ever happened to me
hope they're not around right now in any
case yeah like it can be a bad time so
weeds relaxing and then you know take a
couple puffs off a joint and you have no
idea who you are for four hours you may
not feel super relaxed
next
if you use weed close to bedtime it may
reduce your sleep quality while
expanding your sleep quantity then on
the net balance it does not the greatest
thing for your sleep and thus for your
recovery especially at a very deep level
you can get sleep
if you're high on weed but a lot of
times you don't enter into super deep
rem sleep as often
and that's not that good
so
potentially a downside there
in addition to that in a lifestyle sense
weed definitely during and even for a
day after can make you lazy
and uh just averse to getting shit done
shit like work which you need in order
to buy food to get bigger
and even training which you need in
order to stimulate your muscles to have
them have a reason to grow so uh you
know a big downside there is if you're
using weed to recover but it ruins the
fucking rest of your life that's kind of
shitty and a huge potential downside of
weed for many people is that it can
cause you to overeat junk food which of
course potentiates a ton of gains of
muscle but also unfortunately a fat
so if you're going to toke up smoke up
you know use dope as they'd probably say
in some bygone era of anti-drug
proselytizing
i have a few tips for you on how to
there none of this is dogma now this is
religion but just a few tips that you
may consider trying to use to if you're
gonna use uh thc and by the way this
applies to smoking what do the young
kids do now vaping
i think vaping is cool i don't even do
it i'm just like if i see someone vaping
i'm like that guy's cool you know i
don't hate myself because i'm not cool
but real recognizes reeler
and of course edibles fall under this
category as well so if you're going to
use these things take a few tips with
you and see if maybe they work for you
so a first tip is
and this is something i use in my life
as well
i never ever ever in a million years
ever use
any kind of drugs at all
and uh
marijuana if i haven't done my work and
my training for the day yet i do my work
my training and then as soon as i have
no more responsibilities then i'm saying
your boy is on cloud nine but until then
i would recommend that you save that
shit for another time so very distinct
time of work and training at a very
distinct time of relaxation where you
may choose to use weed
another one is especially if you're
dieting or especially if you tend to go
off the deep end and eat just like
five bags of chips and fall asleep if
you're on weed i would recommend having
your meals pre-prep beforehand or in the
fridge or something or just have
arrangements they're like oh yeah like
i'm gonna go to you know have an alarm
on your phone that says go to chipotle
and order the following your friend
drives you over you're like hello
chipotle employee i would like the
following you can barely read your own
text but it's good enough have a plan
for what you're going to eat and
pre-made meals are a really good way to
do this so that you don't end up like
you know eating only candy bars that
night and no protein that actually can
happen
if you are on a fat loss diet you're
very hungry try to figure out how wheat
affects you
for some people
when they're on weed they're so busy
like taking in sensory experiences they
don't even eat anything that's totally
fine for some people they can eat food
normally and it's not a big deal for
some other folks they're really hungry
already and they're super dieted down
just that taste of food on weed is so
good that they just keep going and going
and going and fall off
so if you're in that last category if
you're really at the tail end of a fat
loss diet and super starving maybe don't
use weed until you're out of that
one or two weeks after
your diet ends recovery period then
reintroduce the weed again and then have
your meals and and so on and so forth
i would stop consuming any kind of
products with marijuana in them about
three hours before bedtime at the
closest to bedtime because then it
cycles through and it doesn't fuck up
your sleep as much if you like
toe toe toke
make sure to put it out because you
don't fall asleep or join your mouth and
burn your whole house down including
your own body
if you take token then uh put out the
joint and fall asleep that can put you
to sleep but it's a lower quality sleep
and
unless that's the only way you get to
sleep and you probably should be seeing
a professional for that uh not
recommended so if you're decent sleeper
i would say weed and asleep i would
spread out um perceptually like when
you're taking a shower before you go to
bed this is my international symbol for
showering get at the armpits uh you
should like be feeling like ah i can uh
do
some calculations in my head i can do a
job i have a good perception of actual
reality like if you're getting ready for
bed and you're like
super loopy like you're still high as
fuck and your sleep is probably not
gonna be ideal at least for the first
third or half of that night
and lastly be ready to feel a little
groggy the next day it doesn't mean
something crazy happened
and it usually wears off by the first
third or middle of the day and later
that day you feel super super awesome
but uh just know that it's coming so you
know you can contextualize it uh other
than that you know what i'm saying
enjoy
and uh yeah weed
weeds cool if used responsibly and after
all your work
is done how lame is that
just ruin your life smoking weed all the
time
anyway see you guys next time
