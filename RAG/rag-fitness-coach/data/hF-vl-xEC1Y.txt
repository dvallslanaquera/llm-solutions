[Music]
hey folks dr mike jared feather carlin
and carol
yes they are professional physique
athletes and yes they have a lot of c's
r's and l's in their name isn't that
strange strange world today you know
what else is strange
massive mega ultra back workout coming
their way and maybe a little bit of
delts after and maybe not a little bit
of adults but actually a lot of delves
scared yet
they don't get scared these are cold
serial killing merc
ladies i was going to say another one
that wouldn't be too nice to say hey how
about i shut up but we go work out
sounds good see you then
[Music]
first exercise on today's agenda is a
superset it's going to be barbell road
to chest superset to bent row
carlin as we mentioned she is one week
post contest actually carol is doing
another competition this year
and she is in her final messa cycle
before the show so as you guys know we
like to put in a lot of intensity
techniques supersets being one of those
this is going to limit the axial load
for the rest of the week because the
road to chest portion is a lot harder
than the bent row so when you do that
first you're actually taxing a lot of
the back musculature to then go into the
heavier compound which is the bent row
so this first exercise is going to be
the superset and then we'll do a giant
set and a little bit of lat pull downs
and a higher rep wrench but for this
it's going to be basically 10 to 15 on
the on the
road to chest and then 10 to 15 on the
bent row and
three sets good last one
up

the back machine i'll take care of all
this
[Music]
finished bent row superset now it's time
for machine rows more roaring volume the
lower back gets real tired with that
bent row superset so now we're taking it
out of the equation and making sure the
emphasis is all on the upper back lats
and all that other musculature including
the mid-back including the part of the
spinal erectors that arches the mid-back
and then lets it round under tension
we're gonna be doing a giant set which
means a set total of reps i think it's
like 55 total reps ladies have as many
sets as it takes to get that done they
alternate back and forth let's hit it
16 get to 20.

got a back palm yeah okay
cool
[Music]
pull downs
mom loved him grandma loved him and you
know what even great grand mammy loved
them because they're so effective
they're not super sexy they need to be
done properly you can do them with a
completely upright torso and swing the
bar down on your shoulders like this you
can also do them leaning back both are
highly effective they just hit slightly
different parts of your back our best
advice for us highest stimulus to
fatigue ratio for you so if your joints
and lats and back feel better doing them
like this do them like that if they feel
better doing them like this do them like
that you can even do a few months of one
way in a few months the other just treat
them as two separate exercises the
ladies here are gonna do oh three to
four sets of about 10 to 20 reps of pull
downs we happen to use the mag grips
they're an excellent choice but one of
many other excellent choices so if you
ask the question are mad grips better
flats the fuck out of here with that
dumb ass shit yes they are a fine choice
but not the best choice because at some
point they might not agree their elbows
and shoulders they never do with mine i
fucking personally hate them but that
doesn't mean shit for you because you
might love them and if the muscles are
getting stimulated and joints are nice
and safe it is the right answer folks
enough of me blabbing
let's train
good
stretch
good big stretch
good big stretch
like a machine keep going good three
more come on touch
one all the way down
yeah touch and one more you got this
easy day today stop chest up just up
just up just stop and that's it good job
great
like a machine
step right here you got it all the way

[Music]
all the way down
the chest there you go two more
one more all the way down let's go let's

have to boss at the bottom
perfect
perfect that's it
let's go go carol go
[Music]
that's it that's failure that's it good
good good that's all we ask
very
[Music]
good back is done we're on to delts
super arm laterals they're amazing
they're not the best they're just
another great tool
try to keep your hands as close to
parallel to the ground as you can if you
point the thumbs up just to keep your
shoulder safe that's fine but don't
point them up on purpose try to keep the
shit parallel and then up to here and
the huge critical factor is to slow the
eccentric because you get a ton out of
that don't just do this crap and
remember on the way up it's not from the
hips it's just from the shoulders all
right about four sets three to four sets
here 10 to 20 reps each time and maybe a
little drops it just to ghost dumbbells
this exercise screws you up so much you
might not even be able to do this
normally
good
slow
