this meeting is being recorded folks
we're back it's the
q a i almost said it i almost did it i
almost screwed up
i thought i was nodding for you to say
it because i'm stupid enough to be like
yeah it's
like yes it's the question and answer
nar
mike are you at your beautiful new home
in michigan
i am as you can see it's three feet wide
and
this is the whole home you see it night
right now that's it's good it's really
good the bug situation in michigan is
interesting they're more
summertime yeah it's ruthless yeah and i
grew up in michigan
but i didn't grow up uh this far outside
of the
uh city of detroit this is a bit further
outside
and gee whiz you know the bugs there's
biting flies they follow you and try to
kill you
and that's not cool um
we have we have like flies we don't have
a lot of like mosquitoes and have you
seen the like did i show you the fly
bait traps that i put out
no oh yeah mel was talking about that
dude they're
fucking disgusting so the first
like the first ingredient if you look on
the label is like putrification agent
this is fucking this is bag you fill it
with water and
it just attracts flies they go in they
die but then the dead fly smell actually
attracts more flies
so you go out and you look at it you're
like oh there's like some dead flies in
there and then you come back and there's
like 10
000 dead flies in there and it stinks
it's awful
um but it can help if you're having like
a lot of flies
you just got to put them away from the
house like like 20 feet from there right
the flies go to that first and and
hopefully
go there and die instead it's a one-way
one-way door sort of situation
exactly but then yeah like a week later
you'll be like
what smells like rotting fat guy in my
lawn
yeah dude it's but there's no flies but
there's no fly so it's trade-off like
rotting fat guys smell or no flies
so you guys got over there okay
everything's good everything's good and
i'm as a matter of fact just ready to
get
started on these questions that's how
good i am
hell yeah let's do it
all right our first contestant is
the greek trojan the greek trojan
okay oh he's got a lot yahoo
all right so he says
less a direct question but a long-term
suggestion for future content
i'd love you to do a maintenance video
series for trainees who more or less
reach their goals and fitness-wise and
are doing it for although i'll structure
it
i understand basically like maintaining
volume keep mess of ours high but it'd
be useful to see considerations in terms
of motorcycle design variation etc
people want to maintain their physique
slash strength slash fitness stability
without necessarily becoming advanced
trainees
an unsafe topic that probably won't
generate massive amount of views but
it's one i'd love to see explored thanks
for everything you do
you know it's in it's actually in the
docket to get this done it's already
listed
um but it won't get done for probably a
few years because we have that many
videos
in reserve uh ready to be made ready to
be recorded a bunch of them have been
recorded already
so it's uh it's a thing and
eventually we will get to it but uh just
a quick
um guide is the biggest thing is how
little volume and frequency you need to
maintain a physique
it's all together different for we need
to get there so imagine like
you know if you got there doing six days
a week of training for
an hour and a half each time with four
days a week of training
and 45 minutes each time you can
maintain your physique for sure for a
long time
so it's it's like that and so the
biggest problem the biggest mistake
people make
is they think like no it's got to be
more than this and it's usually not
james any quick insights there yeah yeah
and so that's
so that's kind of coming at it from the
minimalist approach of like
what do i need to do to just maintain
but for a lot of people who reach their
fitness goals and i would throw myself
in there some people just enjoy training
but they just don't want to
necessarily push it to new levels and go
through the pain and suffering that that
requires
so from a training perspective i mean
you kind of can you can kind of span the
gambit of like
pure like kind of maintenance style
training where you're just doing it just
enough to kind of keep what you have
or actually just doing you know pretty
rigorous training but maybe not always
pushing up to your mrv or
maybe not always pushing certain body
parts to mrv like your back or your legs
for example and maybe you choose to push
other ones
so a lot of the training stuff is kind
of it can be doesn't have to be but
can be very similar to what you were
doing before and a lot of the stuff um
kind of
works itself out with the diet like if
you're just not doing quite as much
fussy stuff with your dieting
you'll tend to hold your body weight
stable anyway and that's where a lot of
it comes so it's just kind of
pick your poison in terms of how much
training you want to do
like if you enjoy training you do more
if you don't really like doing the
training then you do a little bit less
and then kind of hitting your stride
with like what is a good healthy
lifestyle in terms of your diet how much
meal prep
and stuff do you do you want to do or
don't want to do and kind of go from
there
yeah yep yep yep yep
all right next up is henrik anderson
oh boy he is
delivers every time i spelled it wrong
but i still found it
he says do my reps stimulate the fast
twitch muscle fibers
can my reps be a substitute for sets in
the 5 to 10 rep range
for example this meso i'm doing good
mornings in the ten to twenty range poor
so far with five to ten
god what uh what's wrong with you we're
all different
and uh hamstring curls in the 10 20
range as well if i do my ups and my
hamstring curls will
provide enough student life for the fast
twitch fibers that's meso one more
example train doubts in the 510
range simply does not work for me well
my reps stimulate the faster fibers
enough for optimal hypertrophy so
first of all we don't know for sure if
high rep training actually stimulates
the faster fibers significantly less
we know very likely that very low rep
training doesn't stimulate the slower
twitch fibers potentially enough
but we don't know if the reverse is true
because as you get close to failure the
faster fibers end up kicking in anywhere
now there's a little bit of a problem
there where though
in my reps you would think okay each
little mini set three or four reps
you know all the other fibers are
pre-fatigued maybe the faster fibers are
going to be the ones that we rely on the
most and there's some truth to that
however
as you get more and more fatigued your
faster fibers actually recover less well
between mini sets
than your slower fibers so they may
actually start
to really not contribute much so i don't
think my reps are the answer
to faster twitch specific hypertrophy i
think faster fiber specific hypertrophy
in my view can't be done with anything
short of such a five to ten now that
being said
if you do you have to remember another
thing faster fibers are very sensitive
to volume
and they just don't require a lot of
volume so even
when they're active at the tail end or
through the middle part of sets of 10 to
20
in almost every case that's going to be
100 enough to get them to grow as big as
they're ever going to be
as long as you're getting close to
failure and training really hard now for
some folks that are so fast fiber
dominant
and the aerobic system is so not so it's
not that great
that for them their best sfrs actually
occur in sets of five to ten
uh and not in sets of ten to twenty for
some exercises like the very exercises
you described
the thing is if you don't get great sfrs
in those ranges
that kind of means you're probably not
stimulating a whole lot of growth in
those ranges either
and don't worry about it if you just do
the ranges with a little bit of
diversity
and you do mostly the ranges that give
you great stimulus to fatigue ratios
i wouldn't worry about fiber types or
anything like that you're probably doing
damn near
almost everything you can do for the
optimal hydrotrophic response
so that's my takeout yeah really good
and then you can also kind of periodize
even
even just taking like this the snapshot
of the good morning you could kind of
periodize that across several mesocycles
where
maybe five to ten isn't your jam maybe
you split the difference and you say
okay i'm gonna do like
eight to fifteen on mezzo one just
because the lighter weights tend to be a
lighter weight tends to be a little bit
better and then maybe you
really hit your stride in meso two with
your 10 to 20 and then you kind of go
from there on meso three to figuring out
which direction you want to go
but yeah there are that's that is kind
of what mike's the thing is what mike
said is there's really no way around
lifting heavy weights for that faster
twitch specific hypertrophy and i don't
think that's something like those
intensification techniques can
necessarily kind of
circumvent that i would say i'm sorry
i'm beating this to death and i
i already like giggled at it but good
mornings 10 to 20. man i have a hard
time with that one that
i would i would um i would play around
with that a little bit more and see if
you can do it in a way where you could
load it a little bit heavier
because at that point like your
hamstring curls are covering
that rep range really really well i mean
that particular exercise is meant
for you to use a shit load of really big
muscle mass
uh sections of your body like your lower
back your glutes your hamstrings
so that's like idea ideal for loading
heavy i know it's an awkward movement
for a lot of people
my suggestion would be to maybe play
around with it maybe split the
difference and see if you can do like
sets of like
8 to 12 that are pretty stimulative for
yourself
super super good advice next up is
rhino spelled r-h-y-n-o-m-e
got it all right it's a pretty simple
question
dear doctors when i do overhand lat pull
downs the long head of my triceps will
fail before my lats am i defective
no that's actually common for quite a
few people it's
usually common it's usually my
experience and i gotta tell you if
you're doing lots of pulling
with a full range of motion especially
at the stretch really going like this
with your pull-ups and pull-downs and
really stretching out with those
it is um the long head gets so much work
that when people do a lot of overhead
tricep work and so you gotta hit the
long head long again everyone's obsessed
with the long hand
probably because that's the only head
they know and they think it's some kind
of mystical thing
it's like vmo man you gotta hit your vmo
like what did it take
like shut the fuck up why don't you name
me another part of the quad they're like
oh
it's like exactly go to go find yourself
so cue
yeah i don't know so the long head in
most folks that are training their back
properly we get so much stimulus from
pulling
you don't need to train it by itself so
you can do skull crushers and things
like this you can do push on this thing
like this you can do dips and things
like that but overhead
tricep work unless you find it has a
really great sfr isn't one of those
things you need to do
because the uh triceps are covered with
a long head
so well in pulling so there's nothing
wrong with you and i would say it's just
a great tricep workout
and if you just keep lay off the
overhead tricep work
and keep doing multiple sets of pulling
and do some underhand work and stuff in
ways that
maybe your lats are pre-exhausted or
actually just you know first
to fail then i don't think you're
missing out on anything it's kind of
like hey cool this exercise also really
stimulates this one super well
yeah so your tricep can get conditioned
to that activity
however i would say if um if you're
finding that you're leaving a lot on the
table
as a result of your triceps giving out
then it's worth playing around with some
other stuff and you might just say like
that's just not a great
movement for me for this reason and my
triceps just not quite conditioned to
take that beating
and then like mike said you can try some
underhand variations some close grip
variations maybe a neutral grip
stuff like that and see if that see if
that works really the ultimate question
is like you know
could could you be doing more back
training or could you have higher
quality back training
if this was not a limiting factor and if
it's not a limiting factor then just
keep keep doing your thing and it's not
a big deal
if it is then it's worth playing around
with a little bit
yep next up is forest white mash sorry
hold on
i'm noticing this this video and i'm
sensing an untapped market
how do prison inmates get big strong
inject 298
000 views mike we need to open up a new
division of rp called
rp prison marcos rodriguez already
volunteered to run that division really
see we could get like government
subsidized funding
it would be amazing prison workout
the prison workout program pwp
nice more acronyms
all right a man who may be in prison we
don't know
forest nash fitness
got it all right he says hey docs
what are your thoughts on supersetting
biceps and triceps in an arm focused
workout
i know you usually recommend against
antagonist supersets other than to save
time
it's definitely not an issue for me
since i have no friends and live for the
gains however i find the systemic
slash cardio fatigue is usually pretty
minimal for these exercises and doing
them in an alternating fashion ie sets
of curls rest every 45 seconds
sets of push downs rest 30 45 seconds
repeat gives me an awesome total arm
pump and i love doing it
i've also heard from matt hansen but
there could be some antagonist
potentiation benefits of training this
way
why imagine it wouldn't be super
significant my question is do you think
it'll be less optimal to train
as i described above rather than simply
doing all my sets of biceps
then moving on to doing all my sets of
triceps thanks for being the best
well thank you so much for the kind
words forest mash
so i will say that there is a great
there's a really good reason to try to
do
some of that uh i wouldn't say cross
potentiation so what happens is
when you're doing a curl your triceps
are still somewhat active
in most folks especially untrained
people and they actually pull back down
on the joint
when you're trying to activate your
biceps maximally and it results in less
load being lifted
that's not so great from a strength
perspective because it lets you handle
less load
or do fewer repetitions but from my
personal perspective your biceps still
have to overcome the pull of the triceps
so generally speaking they still get the
same stimulus because they have to pull
against either musculature or load
and they still reach as close to failure
as they would and so on and so forth
so i would say that that uh antagonist
potentiation benefit is
really likely to result in a big
difference in hypertrophy
or difference at all that being said you
know if you really like the full arm
pump that's cool
however a lot of times especially if
you're training triceps and your biceps
get pumped it actually limits the range
of motion and the stretch
your triceps can get especially as you
get bigger and
what i would do is ask you to check out
how set for set sephora sets after set
your repetitions go in the bicep and
tricep movements
with a classic traditional amount of
rest versus the amount of rust that
you're giving them in the alternating
superset
if the alternating superset basically
results in rather similar performance
and you're getting great pumps i
wouldn't worry about it you can do
either way but if you like gotta be
honest like
when i do supersets my reps are cut by
one-third if i just rest the normal time
and do the
the the muscle groups by themselves then
you know i don't know it's not that's
not something perhaps that that's wise
to do
uh you know that really is an argument
for making sure you take that 30-45
second rest
make it longer um maybe you can do that
but still do alternating
uh sets of biceps and triceps but just
rest a long time between
i would say one of the downsides is that
is that it might interfere a little bit
with your mind muscle connection
because you uh after doing sets of curl
curl curl curl
you might actually be learning how to
curl better without any distractions
and you get much better mind muscle
connection set up yourself to set after
three or four sets you're getting the
best mind muscle connection or if you do
curl extension curl extension curl
extension it's kind of a mishmash
maybe you can get a good mind muscle
connection but maybe it's like oh
i have to retool for bicep curls
not getting into the groove as much so
that being said i would say the vast
majority of the reason why people do
supersets in real life
uh like arm supersets they just want
their arms to look as big as possible
um in one workout which is not usually
something that's
either muscle group splits like biceps
and triceps on their own day
separately or push legs pull splits
actually allow
um and they're we're trading off
psychological benefits
and we're saying those are more
important than potential physiological
benefits so again if your performance is
just as good
it doesn't matter if the performance
suffers because you're super setting
if your mind muscle connection suffers
then i would say super setting is
fun and makes your arms look really cool
temporarily but
long term it may not add as much that's
my take
yeah i totally agree with dr mike here
it is common for a lot of people for
like your triceps and your biceps to
fall on the same days like i know that
happens twice
in my uh my training week um so what i
would say is like if it's something like
if
do what dr mike said first and foremost
and just make sure your performance
isn't totally tanking
i have not worked with anyone where it
didn't
tank let's just put it that way like if
you ask somebody to do the supersets it
always tanks that's just how it goes
like
if it doesn't tank for you that's fine
that's good then you can roll with it
um that being said if you wanted to
incorporate that strategy
i would maybe limit it to one session
per week
so that the other sessions you have more
traditional just set and rep
schemes for those muscles so you know
they're getting hit as hard as they
feasibly can
and then you might be have if you have
another session where you're doing the
super set
you know it would be effectively like a
light or kind of pump up style session
for that week which is also okay
it's not necessarily a bad thing but it
is a bad thing if you could just be
either doing a lot more sets and reps
and or a lot more weight
uh not doing the supersets so just
play around with it a little bit and see
how it goes like if the numbers are
comparable then cool have fun with it
but again if you're using that method i
would keep it to one session per week
very good insight next up is
tomare t-o-m-e-r
all right i can't hate i've been i've
been internationally i know
that's because you're also lame
impulsive just kidding
folks don't get on me about that all
right from
a hypertrophy perspective is it worth it
to do some top sets of two to five
wraps on compounds bench spot deadlift
in order to drive more progression so
i'll i'm just gonna nip this in the butt
right now because not if this is not i
have to comment on this as it goes
it doesn't drive more progression it
just does
it makes you stronger that is to say
your ability to lift either for one rip
max or sets of three to six
but it doesn't make you better at
lifting in the hypertrophy ranges
themselves
certainly it violates this principle of
specificity if that was going to improve
your ability to lift night perfect range
more than
hypertrophy lifting itself like sets of
5 to 10
will make you as good as possible in the
short term at least five to ten
and there's no reason to believe that's
different in the long term in this
particular case
anyway so it doesn't drive more
progression let's let's move on
and if it will drive a progression it
doesn't there will be more total volume
sets times weight times reps used in the
workout although volume counts
through sets uh
so here go ahead james yeah so the the
effect of the weight
in that equation is insignificant
compared to the
changes you would see from the number of
sets that you do and or the number of
repetitions you do
so if you're just doing a pure like this
is like a very
basic basic exercise science volume load
calculation
you have somebody doing sets of let's
say 225 versus 275 and you were looking
at the differences in volume you'd say
oh the 275 was a little bit more
okay do two sets this time now the
volume's like
you know literally double at this point
you know see what i'm saying so
that's probably not the best way of
stimulating volume
and as mike said it's it's it is a
diverging goal in terms of strength and
i would also say a very significant um
trade-off in terms of injury risk
potential from doing more standards yes
yes brilliant and then he says so i
guess my question is assuming sets are
equated is more total volume
leading to more tension hypertrophy
responded
when reps are same but weight is up well
you
reps can't be the same and weight up
because if weight goes up reps have to
go down if we standardize reps in
reserve
so if your weight is the same
or sorry if your reps are the same but
you can increase weight a lot and
you were just doing sandbag bullshit
junk volume before so that's no good
and he says for example if one is weak
or trains for hypertrophy will he
benefit from one and two strength mesos
so that he will come back to hypertrophy
his total volume will be higher
thus more tension on the muscle equals
mutual if actually we can set up this
experiment
you have someone trained for a strength
for eight weeks and you have someone
trained for hypertrophy weeks
and then afterwards who's doing more
volume i guarantee you the person who's
practiced doing more volume is doing way
more volume as a matter of fact i was
just at the nsca conference giving a
talk and
we're talking about this specific thing
with bradshaw feld and brent contreras
and brad said you know there's just one
study that's kind of interesting and
maybe there's something to getting
stronger before you get bigger
but then brett said look like the girls
that i have that go for strength for
eight weeks
then they transition hypertrophy they
don't even hit their maximum reptiles
they're like oh my god like
i used to do this for 12. i can't even
do it for eight and eventually after a
few weeks they
break the all-time pr's and go on and go
forward then it's literally there's a
specificity thing there where like if
you get good at sets three
you're not really good at sets of three
and it's gonna take you some time to get
back to sets of ten
you could have just gotten better at
sets of ten by doing sets of ten the
entire time now
the silver lining to this is that
occasional strength training potentially
is one of the tools
to delicious lowering volume allows you
to re-sensitize the volume come back
bigger and better and really get a good
progression going
so as long as you do that which can be
done with low rep strength training for
like you know two to four weeks
at a time that is really good for you
but is there some kind of magical thing
by which getting stronger makes you
bigger
is there a magical thing by which
getting bigger makes you stronger yes
because you're adding
tissue and you can make that tissue
stronger is there a magical thing by
which getting stronger makes you
bigger it's just not clear that that's
the case any more than just
getting bigger will get you bigger will
get you bigger and remember there's a
big opportunity cost here too
when you're training for strengths
assuming you're not a beginner
you're not going to gain any size that
time and this is someone who maybe even
trains for size the entire time you know
you're going strength size and they're
going size size
even if their second size meso isn't as
productive as your second size meso
which is say your first because you're
training for strength the first one
that doesn't matter because they gained
a shitload of size in their first one
that you haven't gained at all
so there's no way that one of your size
mesos is going to be better an
absolute gain than two of their size
mesos so there is a nuance there where
every now and again every few months a
two to four week low volume period is
really a great idea
outside of that it's just not clear to
james and i why
in god's name you were trained for
strength and trust me james and i used
to do it all the time we just got dick
out of it
we looked at the literature the
literature says probably get dick out of
it
and then practically there's all kinds
of concerns nowadays i almost never do
it and almost no good bodybuilders do it
when they know what they're doing
because it's just so high so much more
luxurious
like you know imagine pulling your pec
uh doing sets of three in the incline
bench
and someone's like why did you do sets
of three and you're like to like
potentiate potential size gains like can
you explain the mechanism you're like i
don't know
like wow sweet you just tore your pack
for what you're like i don't know i
get it it was just fun to go heavy and
uh yeah it's fun to go heavy it's
something different
yeah i think honestly and i'm gonna
speak frankly here this is not to judge
anyone we're all in a different place
and it's okay
the vast majority of the reason people
try to do when they do traditional
hybrid for training and they say now i'm
gonna go train for strength
it's just really embarrassing how much
how little of the weight they're
handling
in hypertrophy movements like someone
who is going to be hack squatting
135 for reps of you know 15 or sets of
15 reps
you know they might go to low bar squats
and do a straight cycle or two
to do like you know handle 225 to 275
and low bar squat
they sort of like feel like an adult
male or an adult female
whereas the hack squat just one plate
and change is just not doing it for
their ego remember ego is a very very
different thing
than actual results so i would say that
this is not clear that it's a good idea
and has some downsides as well james did
i
that i could hit most of the boxes or oh
yeah absolutely it was a great response
and i think
you know we we kind of touch on this
every now and again it's it's easy to
conflate
strength training and hypertrophy
training because they do seem to overlap
quite a bit but you know in strength
training the amount of weight on the bar
is the driving force and the indicator
that progress is being made so it's good
when you're looking at like okay how
much weight am i lifting because that's
that's basically a a direct measure of
the outcome and the thing that's
potentiating the gains that you want
in hypertrophy training it's just not
the same the amount of weight on the bar
is simply there to get you in the rep
ranges and
sfr zones that you need to be in uh
sorry let me rephrase that it's the
weight is basically a proxy for the
the rep ranges in the intensity zones
within the constraints of the rir
that you're using right so if you need
to hit an rr of three and roughly 15
reps
it doesn't matter that you just put the
weight on the bar that gets you there
that's all that matters in hypertrophy
training whether or not that's going up
or down like is
i don't want to say inconsequential but
it's not as important as making progress
in things like
reps and volume over time so it's a hard
thing to get out of your mind because in
strength training it's
weight goes on the bar and if the
weight's going up things are going well
in my perch retraining it's just okay i
have some rep zones i have sfr
considerations
and i just need roughly the right weight
to get me there within the constraints
of the rir
that i'm using and it's it's tough i can
see why people are reluctant
to think that way because sport training
and strength training are kind of the
opposite
100 very very common
seduction away from what's probably
optimal yeah and it's tough it's tough
on the ego
all right next up is perry battles
perry battles who battles oh my god
it is that's such a funny name
all right gary asks he's got a lot going
on here oh look
he's getting trying to squeeze in
multiple questions perry shame
shane bell he says ring the shane bell
he says hey docs i'm assembling a list
of graduate school to apply to and i
really appreciate your advice
i'd like to eventually study human
performance in athletes my current plan
is to pursue a phd in home performance
sport physiology and i was wondering if
you have any advice concerning one where
to apply to two
has i could take to study sport
performance after graduation
uh oh it was just one and two okay um
and two paths i could take to study
sport phones after graduation
i chose the phd because after talking to
some grad students my impression is to
do
hd right off the bat versus doing a
masters then a phd save some time it
provides better odds of getting teaching
slash research
assistantships that last one is false
letters not true yeah
relieve you of that entirely it's
actually backwards if you have a
master's degree they let you teach
earlier
uh i don't have any debt from my
undergrad and i would love to keep it
that way if possible
okay from speaking with professors in
several different institutions the
picture i have acquired of researching
human performance is that there are
several routes
one get a job at small to mid-size our
institutions you're enough to bring tons
of nih nsf money
try to get funding from supplemental
companies companies that make wearables
etc it's my understanding a lot of
studies on weight training
can be done fairly cheaply this makes
sense to me number two get a job at big
r1 university essentially put your
human performance studies in a public
health wrapper tough to do and
uh yeah good luck putting any human
performance in that at all
um okay let's let's keep going james
we'll let you
circle back here for example instead of
studying vo2 mostly endurance runners
you may primarily study
in for example diabetics looking at
respiratory exchange that's just not
performance at all
um it might be by primarily you mean
solely then yes
uh number three be really phenomenally
amazing and get hired by a professional
or national team
that doesn't get your phd at all
so that's a completely different path
than an academic path
really yeah i mean you kind of you're
kind of talking about academics and
one and two and then three is like a
just profession you know you don't even
need a phd frankly
um but there are opportunities but it's
it's those those are diverging paths is
my point yeah
obviously my first thought was to seek
out jedi master mike but alas you don't
teach in any phd programs that i know of
please like me if you do
my current list includes indiana
university or currently finishing
undergrad etsu which does have a phd
program lehman college which does not
the usf for university of south florida
which i think does and i think that's
where
jay hoffman might be teaching a
different jay hoffman
and thank you for all your awesome
content cheers i'm gonna give my little
blurb here try to help you out perry
great question um
and then james will slaughter all of
your dreams like
like unsacred cows so uh
number three so so the number three
there should really be
pay at least part of your phd program
you'll get some tuition remission for
teaching at the program
you may get full scholarship there's
always a couple available
and most programs uh and then you go to
a mid-sized not r1 institution that's
where etsu falls in
there's a one program that i would
recommend you look into you do not
include
and that is the one at auckland new
zealand that's where calms is
i think they do the occasional phd um
maybe not even the occasional and
there's a lot of phd programs in sport
performance in the united kingdom in
australia
and they always take international
students so i would really encourage you
to look through there
you can reach out to a gentleman named
jackson pios who is i believe doing his
phd right now in australia
and there's um a gentleman named milo
wolff um who's actually one of my
interns
and great guy knows a ton of stuff has
edited
our hypertrophy book and stuff like that
and he
is doing a phd in england and there's
actually quite a few phds in great
britain that are support performances
and i don't know about the funding
situation but sure is something there um
and then what else do i have to say
about that
the you almost certainly for all these
programs have to get a master's degree
first
so uh grad students in something like
psychology
or neuroscience they almost just go
always undergrad right to a phd program
nobody gets master's degrees
in our field generally in most places
they don't even accept you if you have
an undergrad yet you have to have a
master's to be accepted
to a phd program so i'll throw that one
out for you for most
schools but at the end of the day you're
going to want to really like what you're
doing you're
really interested about it um i'm not
sure the quality of the program
lately but etsu is always a place to
consider you will get an education has
put sport performance first um i've
heard decent things about yeah usf
lehman does not have phd programs as far
as i'm aware there'd be news to me
because i do teach there um and then i
would look internationally
and that's i think all i have to say
about that james
um yeah so like my opinion has been
changing
on this recently i actually would be
inclined to
to not encourage as many people to do
the academic route because i think a lot
of the universities are
turning very shitty and charging lots of
money and not giving
students skills abilities knowledge that
they are paying for
that's not totally true in all
situations and i think ours is our field
is
still doing an okay job but the the fact
of the matter is is that
you can do a lot of this stuff without
having a phd um and i would actually
tell a lot of people unless unless you
learn almost all of it
yeah unless phd is a bucket list item
for your life
it's actually not worth it i would i
would just tell when i was when we were
working at temple and people were asking
about doing the phd and they were like
oh
i'm thinking about it's like if you're
thinking about it the answer is no
right it's like are you do you fully
intend to get a doctorate or not that's
really like
where the that that issue stops that's
my take on it
um so just to address a couple of your
points here right i'm looking at one and
two and i'm
i'm not trying to condescend in any way
but let me just assure let me just tell
you one thing right
this is when you are finishing your phd
and you're looking for jobs
you're not going like hmm i've got like
the
top pick over here cream of the crap
over here the first
institution that says yes is where
you're going period
end of discussion if it's dildo college
in new jersey
you're teaching at dildo okay i love
that place if you get
if you put out multiple offers and you
get two yeses like
you are phenomenal right good on you
most likely you're gonna put out like 10
and maybe
one says yes that's how this usually
works now once you get your foot in the
door
then it's easy to move around when
opportunities open up but
you know i'm just looking at one and two
it's like get a job at this get you're
just gonna get a job wherever there's a
job available and that might mean
teaching
like you know biomechanics and exercise
physiology and then maybe having your
own
kind of line of research that you're
running maybe not maybe piggybacking off
something else
so that's that number three right um
this is another one where
the the state of sport physiology
strength conditioning sports science
in the united states in particular is
such an old boys uh
club there's there's no situation even
if you graduate
with a phd and you have glowing
recommendations
zero chance that you're going to get
hired by a national team or a
professional team
unless you have an abundance of in-field
experience like that's just one
actions too knowing those people you
have to know somebody so unless you
had been running strength conditioning
or interning or
pursuing some type of internship on your
own free time
um that's just simply not going to
happen
organically as a result of just
graduating that's going to be something
you're going to have to like really work
hard at
um so that also being said you could get
that you can get a master's degree and
find yourself
in that same opportunity and frankly i
think maybe even more likely because
i think there's more opportunities for
getting a a a
a master's degree in like an exercise
physiology related field
in a lot more places which opens a lot
more opportunities for getting an
internship with like a university
strength conditioning team versus like
only being able to go to one or two
places and the competition's really high
so
yeah um i james i i misread this
question
i answered most of the first stuff i i
didn't realize he said
uh for speaking a professor of several
institution the picture i've required of
researching human performance
is that there are several roots i think
he's talking about at least get a job
so he's not talking about his phd
program he's talking about after his phd
program
oh i think maybe i did the same thing
so yeah so i mean it's actually not
clear to james and i i think that the 3d
really phenomenal amazing
and get hired by professional
international team is after
he met after the phd get a job at r1
after after look listen
once you get your phd you can do all
kinds of stuff including being an online
coach like
like james hoffman over here you know or
like james mostly used to be and
james and i now do more of like running
the company stuff we don't really do a
whole lot of coaching
but you know there's tons of coaches we
hired rp that are phds and there's tons
of people are phds that do their own
coaching companies and all this other
stuff
you wake way more money and have way
more fun doing that
uh than doing r1 research about diabetic
people
unless you really want to do r1 research
about diabetic people
so you don't you know get a research to
just get a job at a university or sorry
getting a phd
just get a job at university is like
holy shit like you know you're gonna
make like
57 000 a year after four fucking years
of brutal school
hey good luck you know it's um you know
good god i mean
i i unless you are absolutely psyched
on basic research and a little bit of
applied research
um i wouldn't go into academia after you
get your phd
so i guess there's kind of two questions
there it's what do i do
because he goes back and says obviously
my third first thought was to seek out
mike you don't teach any phd program so
it makes it seem like it's all one
question about phd but
in the middle here perry's talking about
getting jobs um
i would try to figure out what you want
to do before getting a phd
and this first two the only answer is
do you want to do this stuff and if the
answer is
not really here's here's another one
i'll give you a third one go to a small
school
which has you only be a teaching
professor and then minimum research or
no research community
uh service and teaching and then like
that's what james and i did
i did that at ucm and uh and temple and
jamestown at a temple
and then that was great because we got
to do our side business the entire time
until they got so big that we
it didn't make sense for us to go and be
at school anymore so
i would say that third option is really
really awesome unless you really like
your research and if you really like
your research
then you know gee i get doing research
in sports sciences
is pretty tough but i think number one
is your best bet
uh and then good luck but you know small
to mid-size r1
forget about r1 if you want to do sports
science you got to do r3
so i think we actually i think you see
in the beginning he was talking about
like where to apply to school and paths
to take so i think we split the diff we
i think we got it yes yeah we got both i
think
like so like mike was saying like you
kind of have two diverging paths which
is like do you want to be like public or
private sector right you're like if you
want to be in academia or do you want to
be working in
kind of a field of strength conditioning
or sport physiology stuff like that
and those just diverge at some point
right whereas if you want to
be a researcher then you will reach out
to
a program and you'll find professors who
are doing research in the field that you
are interested in
and see if they have a phd program and
see if they're taking applicants and
then kind of go from there
that's like that academic pure academic
route we're like okay i actually do want
to do research
i'm going to apply to a program so the
men so my mentor is kind of
within the ballpark of the field that
i'm in um and then
then apply right whereas number three
like if you want to work in strength
conditioning like
you can get a master's degree in
exercise physiology or
any of those related fields but what's
more important at that point is like
getting some connections
getting your feet on the ground and
finding some some
uh either teams or programs where you
can work with athletes that's probably
going to be
more important because it's like it's a
fucking old boys club at the end of the
day so it's
what did our friend david used to say
he's like it's not it's not who you know
it's who knows you damn that's wise as
shit
yeah i can't take that i was david he
was full he was full of those gems he's
gonna be like the ultimate dad someday
[Music]
he's gonna have so many fucking
one-liners and zingers um
yeah so again i think we're kind of kind
of
just to reiterate like think about what
you actually want to do
so like mike and i actually really
wanted to teach
which is why we did the third option
that mike proposed because we don't
really
want to do research um but we enjoy
teaching and kind of
disseminating science to other people
and so we got out a lot out of our
our degree because we were professors
for several years and we got to teach a
lot of students
and at some point we found that the
private sector was
in many ways more responsive and
certainly more lucrative than the public
sector and so we made a career switch
but
i think a lot of the opportunities that
we have now are results of us making
those choices and doing the things that
we did early on in our career
yeah yeah
all right earth
earth savior that's very pretentious
just let you know earth savior captain
planet over here
yo her savior hey save this
all right he says should you stop
cutting if you develop wear and tear
issues
have been experiencing elbow discomfort
a couple of months which although it
hasn't gotten noticeably worse it's
irritated
by pressing and pull up so it isn't uh
healing either after a week eight weeks
of cutting
i decided to deal for a week in order to
pay close attention to which exercise
irritating elbows that i could make
technique adjustments and architecture
where necessary
i've now chosen to do a maintenance
phase for a few weeks so that i can
decrease frequency or pressing exercises
the main culprit
was i was doing some variation of bench
press three times per week i like to
finish off my planned 12 week fat loss
phase my thinking is that a few weeks of
maintenance will desensitize me to
volume
therefore i'll be able to retain my
muscle at a lower volume if i choose to
continue my cutting
i'd also like to shift most of my chest
taxes to the 20-30 rep range for my
elbow sink however i'm not sure
whether i'm likely to lose chest size by
doing this i could save you that one if
you're training hard
hard sets of 20 30 you're not gonna lose
any chest size and he says do you
both think my plan sounds like a fine
idea or would it be better off
maintaining for longer
two-thirds length of fat loss stage
before cutting again as always thank you
both so much in advance so to the length
of the fat loss phase is just to
resensitize your hormones and hunger and
psychology for more dieting
if you're just gonna do another four
weeks dieting you could just kept going
and the fact that you took some
maintenance to heal up your tissues is
totally fine
i would say that if you do a raw and
real assessment
and in that assessment you come to the
conclusion that well
i think my elbows are going to be just
fine for the next four weeks then yeah
after you finish a little mini
maintenance four weeks of dieting is
great you can make a wrong real
assessment or even after one week of
dieting your elbows just start to like
um you know bleed out of your ass for
you then i would say it's time to end
the cut
go do some active rest really re-figure
your configure exercises do some
maintaining do some slow massing
make sure all the elbow stuff feels
completely and then later on
do another a serious fat loss phase
that's a little bit longer than this one
so i think your plan is great as long as
your elbows actually
don't get much worse through that four
weeks of cutting you plan on doing james
yeah great answer i so just to make a
point like the the issue here is
probably not
the cutting itself so much as either
your technique or your frequency or your
exercise selection on the sounds like
the bench press
i mean three times a week is probably
okay for most beginners maybe early
intermediates but once we get that kind
of intermediate intermediate stage i
would personally if you're doing chest
three times a week
i'd like to see like a heavy press maybe
a fly type movement and then maybe a
lighter like dumbbell press or incline
press or something
along those lines for this exact reason
because your elbows can only take so
much of a beating with the pressing
most people will run into this problem
if they if they
are doing like a barbell bench press
variation three times a week so
um the cutting can kind of help you you
know sorry
not going on maintenance for your diet
can help you like recuperate a little
bit but it's kind of
it's really not the issue at hand which
is like you probably need to go back and
look at the things that are causing the
elbow flare-ups
and adjusting those that's probably
going to have more of an impact than the
diet
because really if you're if it's like
okay well these two bench press
variations that i'm doing are really
fucking up my elbows but if i do like a
cam bench press
10 to 20 it's perfectly fine well you
can just do that and keep cutting at
that point then there's no reason to
stop cutting
yeah that's that's exactly correct so
but cutting nonetheless once you do have
problems can't exacerbate things so it's
your fault whether or not you want to
keep going but what you did by taking a
little below to mental maintenance phase
i think is
super super wise you may have to do more
than that but
at least you did a really good start
it's good to nip those things in the
butt before they become like unbearably
bad
next up is riley just writing r
r-i-l-e-y really
oh fucking royally uh how to know when
you can go for another half week instead
of taking a full week deload
also doing only a halfway deload is it
on the front uh
end or back end of the week i.e starting
mesotouring the second half of the week
or ending
one after the first half so which half
of the week doesn't matter
you just have to make sure that your
half week
deload is a very light uh
weight and very far from failure and
very low volume okay
don't just like do uh one less set or
something and say oh i took it easy
because you just maintain the fatigue
instead of dropping
secondly i'll tell you this your half
week of deloading if your fatigue is
pretty decent
will buy you one and a half to two weeks
more hard training the second time you
do that in the meso it'll buy you
another week of heart training the third
time you do that a meso it'll buy you
another half week of hard training and
the fourth time you do it
just doesn't buy you anything because
your fatigue is so high half a week just
doesn't cut it
how do i know this my last nas mesocycle
was a sum total of nine weeks
and i did two uh half week deloads and i
regretted it because i should have just
done
fucking two mezzos um it's just i was
traveling a little bit
i had some stuff come up and it was kind
of like oh halfway i feel great um
i would say that half week is probably
something you use no more than once
and the real question is so now that we
know you usually don't use it more than
once in a mezzo
the only question is okay so it says one
and it buys you one and a half to two
weeks let's say one and a half to two
and a half's an average of two weeks
of progressive training after itself on
average
that might not occur for you so so then
the answer of when to do
that meso sorry went into the halfway
dealer is really quite straightforward
do you have more than two weeks left if
the answer is yes and you're really
overreached
half week's not going to cut it it's not
going to bring you to the finish line if
the
answer is you have two two and a half
weeks or less then yeah halfway could
probably do you really good
uh so that's kind of how i think about
it now that's just fair general advice
uh specifics the situation or your own
recovery nothing beats that
you might be a person that's done this
before and it easily buys you two and a
half weeks
so then you're good to go and then maybe
you can do more than one in a meso
i would just say the incremental
benefits really start to deteriorate
after you one of them
because azure fatigue it's really high
half a week just doesn't cut it when i
tell you guys this i was so
overreached at the end of this nine week
mezzo that i only started feeling good
uh after one and a half weeks of active
rest and then only in the
the latter end of the two weeks of
active rest was i like all right
here we go i was literally one and a
half weeks into active rest
and i was looking at weights that i had
to do just for active rest which was
easiest bullshit ever and i was like how
do you want to be in here yet i don't
want to be in the gym
i only got the thirst back like on that
last weekend holy fuck was i overreached
half week deloads are like very
judiciously used
but they just it's about our whole
venture dr stone right doesn't do what
you think it does
um it's just there's something about a
weak deload which gives you so
much more life um it's almost like
a stupid analogy is if you're hiking for
like
40 miles in one day how much does it
help you
to set up a picnic in the grass in
between the various like miles
like sitting on your ass in the grass
with no soft padding no ability to sleep
no ability to rehydrate a ton
nobody really relax you're still in the
sun you get like a sandwich and
a coke and it's like okay you do that
for 30 minutes how many more miles did
that add to your potential walking for
that day
three to five like you're not getting 10
more miles out of that ship
and then when you're on mile 37 if you
do a 30 minute break how many more miles
does that buy you for the day
one or two and if you do a third time it
buys you another half mile and then you
just collapse because there's nothing
at that point that a little picnic in
the grass in the hot sun will do for you
fatigue is so high you need to go to
home or go to a hotel
and sleep in a bed for 12 hours after a
shower and the biggest meal of your life
and then you're ready to go another 10
or 20 miles so
it's kind of like that it's just some
things just you really need a big reset
which is why james and i
are always for auto regulated plus
pre-planned progressions because some
things you can't auto regulate your way
out of you need a way bigger break
than auto regulation alone would call
for james oh actually that last point is
i was waiting to ask you about so like
for me
a half deload is a strategy that you
would use in an
auto-regulatory fashion not a
pre-planned fashion so i don't know
riley
i'm not sure if this is the angle that
you were coming at this question
uh but i was imagining somebody saying
like okay i'm gonna plan to train for
four weeks then take half a d
load and then you know try and push a
few more weeks after that
that i think would be kind of a misuse
of that strategy
um really you should just plan your
message length so that you can just
train continuously until you can't train
and you deload and rinse and repeat
this would be one where you found
yourself in a situation that you did not
anticipate and you just need to do a
little bit of damage control that would
be my take what do you think dr mike
uh i think that's very good you can
pre-plan
uh half week deloads but the next
question is
why are you doing that you know um
scheduling if you're like look
the way my vacation works this time is i
gotta put in seven weeks
so can i do four weeks half deload and
then finish off like two and a half
weeks the answer is probably yeah
but if you have a free open schedule i
would just trade hard hard hard take a
whole week of deloading
because again all week deloading is like
a really good night's sleep after a big
meal
it heals you in ways at a qualitative
level that little naps can't
just can't do i guess even better
analogy i should have made instead of
stupid marathon
walking analogy is naps versus full
night sleep
can a nap if you're like on a trip
around the world can naps give you
the ability to go from being on a
24-hour cycle
to maybe surviving a 36 hour cycle yes
but can you nap your way to a 48 hour
cycle and still be sane at the end of
that
you need some sleep sleep you need to
get in a couple rem cycles at a time
and there's no number of one and a half
hour naps that you can
close the gap for a full two days of
being awake it just doesn't not gonna
happen
so it's one of those yeah or meth meth
is good for that too
yo yeah you'll be awake but you won't be
saying
you won't be arrested either just be
awake
exactly all right next up
is actually
sir get fidel good
god s-i-r-g-i-t
ah i'm trying to get there we go
okay circuit yeah what
yeah it's quite an avatar too oh yes
he says hey docs what are your thoughts
on pre-workout supplements what
components do you look for in them any
particular standards and products in the
market i will
bow out for this one dr james hoffman uh
yeah
i mean man pre-workout is it's an excuse
to do drugs
right that's really what it is folks um
no i
it's yeah it's uh i don't look for
anything in particular um
so with pre-workouts people respond very
differently so the one thing that you
probably want is
you know caffeine right that's that's
really what you're going for in that
after that there's all sorts of other
bullshit that they put in there like
creatine
different types of creatine most of
which are probably trash um so at that
point like
creatine is kind of hit or miss because
if you're already taking creatine mono
it's like okay well
whatever trash creatine they put in
there doesn't do shit
um sometimes they'll have beta alanine
and
niacin uh which is if you like to feel
like you have
fire ants all over your skin um that's
great if you don't want that and
some people are more sensitive to that
than others like they can cause like
really
severe flushing and um uh more pain
sensation so that's kind of hit or miss
depending on if you like that or not
um yeah i mean really it's just like
you're just taking a really big dose of
stimulants at that point you can get
largely the same effect i don't know
what it is like there seems to be like
people think that like having a whole
pot of coffee is somehow
like worse than getting the equivalent
amount of caffeine from like a
pre-workout you know what i mean there's
like some weird stigma with that
so i don't know pick ones that you like
some have like thermogenic agents that
make you like really hot and sweaty
um if you're into that the thing with
pre-workout
i like pre-workout i'm like like i like
i like like that like kind of
amphetamine fix kind of you know feel
but really it's just an excuse to give
you something to take like a something
that makes you hot sweaty gives you a
boner and makes you take a huge shit
which i mean coffee can largely do that
so i don't know i don't really look for
anything in particular
there's just a couple that i like i do i
have found some that um
didn't sit well with me i was using the
total war and i started to get like
fluttery chest every now and again so i
stopped using that one because
probably it's probably not great um yeah
uh what else um super pump
back in the days to use super pump and
you just give me the super dump
and then they came out with like super
pump max which was just basically like
if you guys have ever seen a dog drink
ocean water and they just have the
continuous spray of poo
coming out their butts that's what super
pump max is basically
um yeah that's really all i got on that
one um it's just
use use the ones that you like that's
you're really just getting your caffeine
fix at that point
yeah they're all caffeine delivery
mechanisms
at the end of the day there's just not a
lot of
anything else that you know
i don't want to talk that shit too much
but that's basically
at the end of the day that's what that's
what it is it's just a way to get
caffeine
still all kinds of other shit in there
most of it just doesn't do anything
yeah they'll say like oh it has all this
like no pump stuff and it's like man
that doesn't do shit
um i'm trying to now now i'm thinking
about it like
they put so much crap in that stuff oh
yeah
you're really just getting it for the
flavor really just pick the flavor that
you like
and the color and the color the worst is
when they have exciting flavors but
the color is like just white or gray and
you're like this sucks suck dude i'm not
convinced this is strawberry this is
white i don't care how it tastes
mm-hmm i heard the flavors were just the
colors i had the bang one
uh that one's okay it's like it doesn't
it doesn't hit
like a truck like some other ones do but
it works
it's fine truck yeah already like a dump
truck hello shorty
all right last but not least excellent
question here
from david parker looks like
it looks like a real estate manager you
might look like a money a legitimate
person
yeah if you get
ill sorry i'm sorry to interrupt you i
can't leave this one alone look right
below
rhone john relationship expert
whoa cool that's his handle
dude i want to know how to do
relationships
we're late in the game we needed your
help before now we're married fuck yeah
what the fuck man we could have been
married to better people honey i'm just
kidding
uh oh we're gonna have to wrap up this
webinar
[Laughter]
all right all right so david parker asks
if you get ill during a cup sore throat
cough sniffles
uh sorry coughlin's cold sniffles do you
jump back in to maintenance calories
until you feel recovered yes
what about the flu maintenance for a few
days longer just to be safe
i'll nuke my immune system for shred
city bruh
gem best jim bro impression
impersonation voice side note there
should be a bro mic
character in the future rv videos i'm
sure he'll be making up and making his
appearance right people like russian
mike
bro mike's a very well practiced man um
all right so uh here's the deal
we'll give you more than you asked for
because we'll talk about training as
well as diet
if you get mild sniffles during a cut
until you feel better and this is a
really good time to do something like a
half week
deload deload on your training and go to
maintenance calories until you feel
recovered why because normally
on mass phase you might be able to train
through a little sniffles and just get
better on a cut your immune system is
already teetering on the brink of dog
shit
and if you push it then you may get sick
sick sick stick and then that'd be
really bad
if you have flu-like symptoms which is
to say like systemic symptoms not just
local nasal throat stuff but like fever
chills etc
what you need to do is go to deload
slash activerest
of course consuming uh maintenance
calories until you feel
real good and then slowly ease back into
your fat loss that's my best take on it
i think you can get away with more
aggressive things in many cases
and i think in most cases that's really
really fucking stupid so actually
i was prepping for my bodybuilding show
this past year and i got covered 19
before i was going to do a show in vegas
and i ended up having to go do a show
in florida because i got a covenant
positive code 19 test and i felt all of
kova 19 when i got it i was like
are they i i suspected i had it i walked
into the uh
the testing center and they're like yep
you sure do have it and i was like
literally
already like water depleting that day it
was friday the show
was supposed to be saturday and i was
like god damn it so i basically just
went into
a deal deload uh eight at maintenance uh
calories
and got plenty of rest and then about
half a week later i was able to start
training in my garage at home
and then half a week after that i was
kind of ready to go do do big things and
i
of course i waited the requisite amount
of time in order to you know develop
antibodies and go out in public but then
i was
training full blast uh if i had kept
pushing it and i haven't done the show
et cetera i could have you know been in
the hospital or something like that and
that's probably not going to happen to
you you're probably going to get you
know you're not going to cope with
you're probably just going to get
regular flu
i'll tell you what guys and maybe james
has stories about this i know i do
um the regular flu if you don't let it
run its course and you keep pushing it
can turn into like a three-week ordeal
where you feel so fucking bad
and then you lose tons of muscle and
strength and everything
you know you'll lose muscle and strength
one way or the other you can lose a
little bit of it
by going into active rest and just
chilling out and doing a super super
easy training
or you can lose a bunch of it and take a
month or two to come back depending on
if you pull back soon
or not so i would say that's kind of the
rules of the game
james yeah i think that was a great
response i think just um sometimes to
like i i'm very much of the opinion like
don't especially if you train at like a
global gym or a public gym like
you know don't be an asshole and get
everyone else sick just because you want
to go to the gym
but sometimes like if you um i've
noticed this with myself
and mel in particular you might be
getting kind of like you wake up and you
maybe have a little sore throat kind of
like the pre
sick symptoms you're not like full on
sniffles yet but you're like oh i might
be getting sick and you kind of know
like tomorrow you're probably gonna be
sick
but sometimes if you just have like a
good night's sleep and a relatively easy
day you can kind of shrug it off and
the next day you're largely you're
basically fine um so
i would say you don't have to be um
hyper conservative in this regard like
if you're having
some like pre symptoms but you're not
like full-on sick yet i think you
probably
just kind of carry about your day as
normal maybe take like a an easy year
training day or day off
and then if the next day you feel normal
then you can just keep going
what i do what i just wouldn't want is
for somebody to be like oh i got a
little scratch in my throat today i'm
not gonna train for three days and i'm
gonna throw my diet off and do all this
other stuff when the reality is is like
as long as you
you know have a relatively uneventful
day and don't have a lot of stressors
going on
you might chug it off and you might just
carry on as normal so just you can keep
that in the back of your mind but also
again like i i
like i said i'm i tend to not appreciate
when people come into the gym
sick and get everyone else sick too so
there's a there's a delicate
balance to strike between those two
things
boom and uh
yeah i don't want to say better safe
than sorry but on the margins
a little bit better safe than sorry so
feel free to push it
but when you know you're like oh i'm
really not feeling good don't keep going
because you're just going nowhere
and it's not like you know i'm tough
like you can be tough and do smart shit
instead of be tough
and do dumb shit shit yeah i agree
was that it for questions that's it dr
mike did you happen to catch ufc this
last weekend
um i was going to make a really shitty
joke in conor mcgregor's experience i
was going to say i didn't have a chance
to hobble over
no no i didn't catch it but i heard it
was all sorts of interesting
yeah the the most of the cards were like
okay it was fine and then
the main event was definitely
interesting um you can kind of
i watch the video back a couple times
and i think where he
throws the rear teep kick dustin goes up
to block he doesn't really like check it
but i think connor catches them right on
the elbow
i think that's where he gets hurt so
injured and i think you can kind of see
he's kind of like
um that's my my take on i've watched it
a couple times i'm not sure could also
have been like he might have already had
an
injury there from training camps or
whatever or he was also kicking really
hard i don't know
if you've seen but the first couple
kicks he threw were really hard he might
have actually injured himself just
kicking dustin there
it's totally possible um but it was
interesting he was very inglorious and
kind of shameful on defeat
unfortunately was just talking really
yeah i mean like part of me doesn't
blame him because it was a horrible
injury and it's
all you know the spotlight's on him and
it's really it was more about him than
dustin so of course he's going to be
flustered and pissed off but he was like
saying how he was going to kill dustin's
family and he was calling his wife a hoe
wait a minute before or after the fight
both actually
no after yeah yeah yeah
it's uh it was very like i said very
kind of inglorious unfortunately for him
it was like not
not a not a great moment he was just
talking shit the whole time it was he
was talking shit before
in the pre-fight conferences and all
that stuff and
uh yeah not not a good book
yikes you know a lot of people say that
like
ronda rousey and conor mcgregor talk
that shit because they're master
manipulators and they know how to get
the ratings in the millions
um and i think that might be true but
then there's an alternate hypothesis to
consider is that there are pieces of
shit to begin with and they just fall
right into who they're supposed to be
yeah um just like math comes off you
default back to your your normals so
yeah
who know right and they're like oh yeah
it's all for the likes or the
money or whatever but you know when you
fall into something that easy and
there's also like they cross the lines
that again you could say
maybe they're crossing line for money
like when you you know talk shit about
someone's family it sure gets them going
and it gets the fight numbers up
but then again like if you're really a
calculating manipulating person
maybe you would be like yeah know i'm
going to do what it takes wwe style
but i'm not going to go further than
that and get like retail sonic yeah
challenge great that but you know maybe
that's uh
maybe that's not enough so i don't know
i'm always
like ronda rousey made some kind of
tweet where she like said something
about the olympics or something she was
like
oh like the olympics cool like you know
she's like if you want to see
sportsmanship go watch the olympics they
sure could use the views
um uh you know and i i just like my
first response in my own head was like
hey remember your face got broken into
50 different pieces and then you never
won
another fight again who the fuck are you
by the way like hey like you're good at
one thing is
punch people in the face and then and
then doing that arm bar thing and
now you can just have a good whole whole
time of shutting the fuck up and being
nobody again so
it was kind of like they were like oh dr
mike that's really mean like well she
said mean things too now we're all being
mean isn't it fun like oh it's not fun
when it's about you
so it's kind of like you know it's
either all in good fun or it's not you
know so
it's so funny when people like people
get pissed at what connor's saying and
look hey man you know he's just being a
sportsman like
so am i you know like he's talking about
shit so why so
yeah well and like you it's like you
also don't wish people to have horrific
injuries because like whether you like
conor or not or whoever else it's like
they've got families kids and stuff it's
like
nobody wants that so that's a lot of the
narrative was like well
karma's a bitch right like you talk all
that shit now you're hurt it's like no
it's it's
a fucking sport it's a fucking sports
contest first of all like
everybody runs the risk of injury it can
happen and nobody wants it to happen
and it's very unsatisfying for both
parties because you know like i was
rooting for dustin but now it's like
dustin doesn't get the nod because the
narrative is like o'connor got injured
rather than dustin defeated him you know
so it sucks
it's unfortunate but yeah it was an
interesting card
agreed next fight card james hoffman
versus dr mike
ufc 5000 panjitsu rules
oh man i'm gonna lose trying to pull
that deep half you're gonna get that
finger and butthole folks hanjitsu is a
sport developed by james hoffman and his
illustrious wife dr moser davis where
the
it's like jiu jitsu but the rules are
that you get a lot of points
for trying to essentially you know grab
somebody's genital region
and you have to be the defense for those
grabs
uh the the what is it is finger in
butthole an instant submission or is it
just like a shit
it's like five points like right off the
bat right like soft to her collar from
that so
you know a lot of jiu-jitsu positions
traditionally just a really
really like you know inverted guard
you're just not playing that anymore
because i mean
somebody can rack up 20 points on you
before you know what's happening
so panchitz is a tough sport you can't
clinch in that position either right you
can't defend
no and then also like you get uh you
have crab guard right
where it's like you like model like a
crab and that's a crab guard's really
good because nobody you you've got the
you got the claws and if anyone's going
to be talking that shit they're getting
a claw
i'm sure our listeners are like what the
fuck are they talking about are they
talking about someone's gonna talk
about jitsu um if you ever see chad
rusty smith in real life
he's in on a joke so just be like hey i
heard you a panjitsu world champion he's
gonna laugh he'll get a laugh out of it
yeah
all right is there any housekeeping for
for this week
uh no housekeeping but uh maybe some
exciting stuff ahead that i can't quite
talk about yet but might be unfolding in
a few weeks so
wait and see folks wait to see but tons
of really really good youtube content
coming your way i will tell you this
okay
so a little housekeeping uh we have
recorded something like
nine training videos in the dragon's
lair in las vegas before
uh we moved to michigan so uh there's
lots of cool stuff coming up and some
really zingy characters so
oh is your is your michigan gym up and
running yet or still still work in
progress
it's not uh so basically we're going to
have like a little private training
facility here
um that's not it's not a public gym it's
not a private gym it's just a youtube
studio slash home gym
it's quite large we'll unveil it when
the time comes but it's still two months
out
we're still like receiving equipment got
to put flooring in it's already
insulated the structure's up
got to put electricity in and also stuff
work in progress but at some point we'll
make a really cool youtube video
introducing the you know i'll probably
call it like a renaissance gym or
something like that it'll be really neat
can i get a key fob to entertain
damn it dude our guard dogs are
instructed to shoot
that's like right they do have guns
they're just going to be doing one of
those guard bulldog is the worst
possible guard dog because he just
doesn't care if you come in or go
and if you come into a house which has a
bulldog you're probably going to get
like
slobbered on and cuddled with and not
attacked funny enough like
you know like tweety bird and sylvester
the cat remember like spike the bulldog
in those cartoons
yeah yeah like what the fuck did you get
a mean bulldog i've never seen a mean
bulldog in my life
speaking of looney tunes i didn't
realize they were making another space
jam movie
oh it was lebron right yeah i saw a an
ad or a commercial for it i was like
what the fuck
are you serious that makes sense i got a
funny joke for you that's uh
not appropriate off-camera joke all
right folks we have off-color jokes to
make we're getting out of here thanks
again for the questions make sure you
guys upvote questions that you like
before submitting your own and then if
other people like yours they'll upload
them too so that's pretty sweet
until next time we are out of here peace
