so out of everything noel has said so
far i think
this is the single most valuable one
because very few guys want to talk
openly about this
yet it's extremely common in the fitness
industry and it can actually cause a lot
of problems for people and sometimes
very serious problems
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and chances are that you've probably
seen this dude show up in your video
recommendations at some point by now
noelle daisel he's pretty quickly become
the fastest growing fitness youtuber
ever in history at the time of this
recording he's averaging 16
000 new subscribers per day which is
complete and total insanity and i've
gotten a lot of dms from you guys asking
about his content because if there's one
thing that we know about online fitness
it's that having tons of views and
subscribers doesn't necessarily
correlate to the quality of someone's
actual fitness advice
so i went ahead and watched pretty much
all of his videos because they're mostly
really short clips
he actually got to start over on tiktok
and then posted the content over to
youtube
and today i'm going to play some of his
videos and give you my reaction
i think some of it is really good some
of it is not quite
as good but either way nothing at all
personal here
noelle seems like a genuine guy who
truly wants to help people
so this is just me responding
objectively to the actual information
itself with the goal being as always
to help you achieve the very best
results from your fitness program
so even if noel's content doesn't
interest you personally
i'd still recommend watching this video
all the way through because it is going
to contain plenty of useful
training nutrition and supplementation
information either way so let's jump
into it and i've sped his clips up
slightly just to make this a bit more
time efficient i am sick
of fake influences my issue with it is
that these people's lifestyles and
physiques are mostly unattainable i've
never claimed to be natural but know far
too many people that do
when they're not or even had surgery but
on social media claiming to result if
their new
lifestyle changes or they just straight
up pay someone to perfectly manipulate
their pictures or buy likes and
followers to get paid brand deals for
products that don't even believe it so i
don't think there'd be any surprise
that this would be something i'd be uh
totally on board with now it's not like
this is some kind of
groundbreaking new information a lot of
fitness content creators do address
these subjects as well
but i think because noel really fits
that sort of enhanced bodybuilder
stereotype
yet he's talking about these things
openly in a sincere down-to-earth way
i think that's what causes people to
really pay attention
and that's what's driving the mass
appeal of his content and that's
definitely a very positive thing
especially over on a platform like tick
tock
where you've got that massive younger
audience who really need to understand
the truth about how the fitness industry
works because
it undoubtedly is a complete [ __ ] show
in so many ways
rampant ped use fake natties unrealistic
body fat standards
photo editing surgeries garbage products
that are then sold based off of those
things
and so the more and more people who are
exposed to this kind of message
the better storms have been all over
tiktok lately but what are they they
research chemicals marketers have
similar results as steroids without the
side effects i hear a lot of influences
psalms
arms arms but did they tell you the
long-term effects i'm guessing not
in my opinion as a teenager or young
adult the risks outweigh
the result again this is absolutely a
message that more and more people need
to hear there are just so many of these
goofball
fitness influencers just recklessly
promoting sarms to their audience with
their
10 off discount code and saying that
it's going to give them steroid-like
gains without the side effects when in
reality
serums can still be potentially
dangerous they still have a wide variety
of potential downsides
and the long-term effects still aren't
known because they haven't been
extensively researched
this is effectively how to lose weight
don't follow fair diet
the only reason is work is because
you're following a calorie deficit
yeah so no matter what specific diet
we're talking about whether it's
keto carnivore low carb paleo
fasting fruitarian breatharian
at the end of the day it still comes
down to the calorie deficit
none of these diets are going to give
you some kind of special fat burning
advantage
it's just that they all have certain
rules in place specific foods or
macronutrients that you're going to cut
down on or
completely eliminate or windows of the
day where you can or can't eat
and those things indirectly end up
reducing your overall calorie intake now
that doesn't mean that all these diets
are necessarily bad
but just keep in mind that you don't
have to follow any sort of fancy
over-complicated dieting strategy in
order to get results
no individual foods or individual
macronutrients are the cause of
fat gain on their own the cause of fat
gain is consistently taking in more
calories than you're burning
and the solution is the opposite you
don't need gimmicky fat burners
or a waste trainer chances are if it
looks too good to be true it most
probably is
yeah obviously no argument there there's
just so much of this [ __ ] on
tick tock and instagram nowadays and it
really is crazy how many people
actually fall for this stuff now you
could argue that that's just natural
selection at play
but i would say that having noelle's
videos circulating around on those
platforms to help combat this stuff
that that definitely is a good thing
it's time to boost your metabolism i
recommend eating five to six smaller
meals per day
this is the principle of more consistent
and regular eating so if you prefer to
eat five to six small meals a day then
that's totally fine
but just keep in mind that eating more
frequently doesn't boost your metabolism
okay this was standard bodybuilding
advice
like 10 plus years ago but it's been
pretty thoroughly disproven in the
research at this point
as far as fat loss goes as long as
you've got that calorie deficit in place
then the way that you specifically space
your meals out during the day that's not
going to make any real difference
to your results fat loss is about what's
happening in the bigger picture
not in these little small windows of a
few hours here and there so if you
prefer
larger meals less frequently that's okay
too just go with the daily meal
structure that you enjoy most and that
you're most likely going to be able to
stick to
since school never taught you how to do
taxes i'm going to you're going to need
taxes i'm going to teach you how to get
a double d manchester pinch press
this isolated exercise is going to give
you that cleavage now i know a lot of
beginners out there are going to think
uh you know well noelle has a huge chest
and so this must be a great exercise and
i see you guys pumping these out all the
time in the gym but i
promise you that noelle's chest
development was not a direct result
of doing these little pinch presses and
that the majority of it if not all of it
would have come from other
more basic movements this is actually a
really deceiving exercise because it
really
feels like it's hitting your chest hard
but that's only because you're squeezing
your hands together and flexing the
whole time
most of that sensation that you're
feeling is not a result of the pecs
actually being
directly loaded by the resistance if
anything this would be more of a triceps
movement because your elbows are tucked
in
and it's more elbow extension as opposed
to bringing your upper arm across your
body which is what the chest
actually does and aside from that
there's no way to
specifically target your inner chest
either you can target upper and lower to
some degree
but not inner and outer the bench press
is king so i like to take it slow
follow along with my timing so yeah
barbell presses are obviously
an effective all-around chest building
movement are they the king of chest
exercises
i would say that if you're not a power
lifter and if hypertrophy is your
primary goal
uh then dumbbell presses are probably
going to be the better choice overall
because they put your wrists and your
elbows into a more natural position
and they optimize the line of pull on
your pecs but you can just try
both a barbell press and a dumbbell
press and see which one you personally
prefer
or you can just include both of them in
your program a more vertical pull
will work your lat whilst the horizontal
pull
works more your inner upper back yeah
that's a good point
if you're doing pull downs and you're
leaning back with your chest up and your
lower back arced
then that's really going to hone in on
the upper back muscles whereas if you
stay more upright then that will help to
bring the lats more into the equation
but also keep in mind that if you want
the lats to be the primary mover in the
exercise
then not only do you want to have your
torso upright but you also want to be
using a narrower grip with your elbows
tucked into your sides
so that you're focusing on shoulder
extension which is the main function of
the lats
your forearms might be affecting your
leg and back development your forearms
are much smaller muscles
though they can be strong as hell but
when doing a grip intensive exercise
like a deadlift your forearms are most
likely to fatigue first this leads to
early failure
and lack of gains so you can work on
your grip strength alternatively there's
some way around
it would be to use lifting straps yeah
this is something i definitely agree
with
and i've talked about it many many times
over the years if you're doing
rows or shrugs or deadlifts and your
grip is giving out before your back or
legs
then ultimately you're completely
short-circuiting the exercise and you're
making it way less effective
because your forearms are what end up
being the primary target so don't listen
to some of these
hardcore lifters who try to tell you
that lifting straps are for [ __ ] or
whatever
you guys are a bunch of [ __ ] if
hypertrophy is your main goal
and your grip is giving out on certain
heavier lifts then you absolutely need
to be using straps or hooks
if you want those lifts to be effective
for the actual muscle group that you're
trying to target
and then if you want to build up your
raw grip strength you can just
incorporate separate grip movements on
the side and if you're enjoying this
video
then you can also give that like button
a little squeeze for some extra
forearm flexor stimulation here's what
you need to consume post-workout after a
big workout
you're gonna need to give yourself a
nice insulin response you're going to
need
an easy digesting carbohydrate to bring
on that insulin response you're also
going to need to get yourself a high
quality
protein to help boost that protein
synthesis and recovery so this one here
is pretty outdated advice the whole
anabolic window post-workout shake
approach um this was standard
bodybuilding advice back in the day
and if you want to have a liquid
post-workout shake and that's fine
but it's definitely not a must either
chicken and potatoes or steak and rice
that's completely fine too and most
importantly you really don't need to be
buying some fancy overpriced
post-workout carbohydrate powder in
order to spike your insulin okay that's
a total waste of money
and you can easily get all the carbs
that you need from regular whole foods
not to mention that carb powders are
pure empty calories as well additionally
you could throw in some bcaas
some glutamine creatine or even
electrolytes so creatine is of course a
solid supplement
the specific timing doesn't actually
matter but you can have it post-workout
if you want
but bcaas and glutamine these are really
just unnecessary and they're a waste of
your money
your regular daily protein intake is
going to cover all of your bcaa and your
glutamine needs
as long as you're getting somewhere in
that 0.8 gram per pound of body weight
level or higher per day and just dumping
extra bcaa and glutamine powder on top
of that
is not going to give you any extra
benefits and i did find this
post-workout shake video a little bit
confusing because
not long before this video he posted
this one i'm on a whole nother level
so i'm not quite sure what's going on
there what are the best workouts to burn
fat in case you didn't know
there aren't any these burn 800 calorie
workouts that you see all over social
media
are somewhat misleading the calories i
burned during the same workout would be
different to you and it's because of
these variables
the best approach to weight loss is
having a base of cutting calories and
any workout you do is helping you burn
off calories
the food you eat and calories you burn
determine your results yeah totally
agree on that
uh most people way overestimate how many
calories they're actually burning
through cardio okay you're not going to
do one of these
youtube or instagram or tick tock hit
circuit workouts and burn a thousand
calories or 800 calories or
even 500 calories most likely now cardio
has a lot of overall physical and mental
health benefits
but from a pure fat loss perspective
just remember that it's
one tool in the toolbox and in most
cases it's more of a supplemental tool
with your diet being the most important
factor to focus on this might be why
you're not losing weight this is a
tablespoon of olive oil that you cook
your chicken with that olive oil
almost has the same amount of calories
as the chicken itself you need to
account for absolutely everything you
consume these small things could throw
you off your progress in a big way
super important tip here that a lot of
people overlook they think
oh cooking with olive oil is good
because it's healthy fat and my trainer
told me that if i want to lose weight
then i should eat more healthy fats now
obviously consuming enough dietary fat
is important for overall health
but again calories in versus calories
out is what fat loss comes down to and
oils
are the most calorically dense thing you
can possibly consume
one tablespoon of olive oil alone has 14
grams of fat
or 126 calories which is just an insane
number of calories for that really small
volume
and most people are probably using a lot
more than one tablespoon if they're
cooking with it
if you're gonna use anything for cooking
then just use a tiny bit of cooking
spray okay just a really quick
just to coat the pan and in case that
wasn't clear and you need another
demonstration zoom in here
ready just like that millions of guys
suffer from body dysmorphia
and we don't even acknowledge it i get a
lot of messages every day from guys that
are depressed because they are not tall
enough have bad skin but going bald
or skinny overweight or you don't have a
small pp they perceive these as flaws
causing them depression anxiety and low
self-esteem whilst most of the time
the floor doesn't exist or is grossly
exaggerated we act like tough guys with
muscles
testosterone but this sort of stuff does
affect us and we need to acknowledge it
instead of suppressing it there is a
fine line between wanting
self-improvement
and body dysmorphia but if you're not
sure do some research or see a medical
profession
so out of everything noelle has said so
far i think
this is the single most valuable one
because very few guys want to talk
openly about this
yet it's extremely common in the fitness
industry and it can actually cause
a lot of problems for people and
sometimes very serious problems if you
get overly wrapped up in the uh
sort of aesthetic side of things you
know you're spending hours and hours
scrolling through
perfectly optimized pictures of enhanced
lifters on social media
it really does start warping your
perception of reality because your
standard for what an impressive physique
looks like
gets massively inflated and then the
standard that you have for yourself
also inflates along with it so even
though you might have a top
let's say one to two percent physique
relative to the general population
a physique that the average person would
look at and consider top tier
you might still feel completely
inadequate because you're constantly
comparing yourself to the top
0.0001 percent so
this is a topic that i could easily
dedicate an entire video to and i
probably will at some point
but it's good to see noel talking about
this given how big of a following that
he has and how many people probably
need to hear it so all in all i would
say that i definitely agree with noel's
content on an overall big picture level
just in terms of
you know the overarching message that
he's putting out there most of it
is pretty basic straightforward advice
but because he got his start over on
tick tock his audience is naturally
going to skew more towards those younger
beginners and so
even though it might seem like pretty
simple stuff you know eat more protein
train hard stay consistent get a proper
sleep
that's actually the kind of advice that
his audience needs to hear
the most now where i would disagree on
um is some of the more specific
practical advice
the overall sort of training style seems
to be more on the
enhanced bodybuilder side of the
spectrum which probably won't be ideal
for most
natural lifters there's some outdated
nutrition and supplement information in
there as well
and if you do want to grab a free
program from me based on the principles
that i would recommend for natural
trainees
then you can visit shawnell.com custom
just fill out the form there and i'll
send you back a structured step-by-step
workout and diet that you can follow
based on your current physique and your
goals the link for that is up here as
well as down below in the
description box but overall i definitely
think noel is a positive force in the
fitness space
and that on the whole the stuff he's
putting out is definitely gonna help
