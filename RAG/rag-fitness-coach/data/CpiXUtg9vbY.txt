welcome back to the fifth episode of
this series
in today's uh vlog i'll discuss a few
things
including how many different exercises
should be used for a given body part
balancing life and training slash
contest prep
considerations for meal frequency and
also diet set up
for me personally so first up how many
different exercises
should be used for a given body part i
think
there are a few considerations here the
first one is
how complex the body part is
for example a muscle group like
say the bicep which
does have the three functions namely
elbow flexion
shoulder flexion and wrist supination
quote unquote
um for a body part like the bicep over a
muscle group like the bicep
you do need a few exercises to make sure
that you
stimulate all the fibers pretty well but
at the same time
because it's not such a complicated
muscle group and it's made of
you know if you just consider a bicep
two heads and then two more elbow
flexors
it's just not that complicated as far as
functions go
that you just don't need that many
exercises to cover all your bases for
muscle growth
you can still make the case that you
should use more exercises
than needed for hypertrophy because it
can reduce
overuse injury risk but at the same time
if you're only looking at it from the
perspective of making sure all the
fibers are hit
you probably don't need to worry too
much about having more than two or three
exercises
but then when you look at the body part
like the back
and to be fair calling a body part at
the back is a very broad term
it's made up of a lot of muscle groups
from the lats
to the tears major um rhomboids
lower traps mid traps etc um
and so for the back for example you will
likely benefit from having a bit more
exercise variation
because there are a bunch of functions
going on from shoulder extension to
shoulder horizontal
uh adduction abduction sorry
to a variety of other functions and so
if you want to make sure you train your
whole back properly
and maximize growth overall it probably
does make sense to at least
three or four exercises for the back
overall um
can you get away with less yes is it
like to be ideal
probably not just because of how
complicated the back is and once again
the same reasoning applies to preventing
overuse injuries
as it does for bicep now certain body
parts
do seem to be a bit more prone to
overuse injuries than others
for example the calves don't seem to be
that prone to injury
while to overuse injury risk whereas the
chest shoulders tricep or arm work more
broadly
can be a bit more prone to overuse
injuries
and so for the body parts that do see a
larger increase in overuse injury risk
with
fewer exercise selection fewer exercise
selection fewer exercises being selected
for those body parts it probably doesn't
make sense to have a bit more exercises
rather than a bit less
i think for most body parts most of the
time
you have a sufficient amount or number
of exercises at your disposal
that you don't ever really need to worry
about running out of exercises
for example for your bicep there are a
lot of different exercises because you
can switch around the grip you can
switch around the tempo you can switch
around
the barbell easy bar dumbbell so
implement machine
cable and so forth but then for certain
body parts like cabs for example
cabs is an interesting one because on
one hand
they are not a particularly complicated
body part
they do mainly one thing which is a calf
raise essentially
and they don't suffer from too much
overuse injury risk
but they also don't have that many
exercises that you can train them with
properly at least so
typically you want to stick to maybe one
to three exercises
per week for the calves um
partly because of how simple they are
because of how low injury risk well
overuse injury risk is
and because of um they're just not being
that many exercises overall
so if you were to use more than two or
three in a given mesocycle
you'd pretty quickly run out of exercise
to switch to
so yeah those are essentially the main
considerations i think for how many
different exercises you should use
i guess one more consideration would be
how much volume does that body part need
typically the more volume a body part
needs and or benefits from
as far as growth goes the more exercises
you want to do
as you do more and more sets for a given
exercise for example let's say i'm doing
dips right here
as you do more and more exercises for
dips more exercises sorry sets
each set becomes marginally less
effective because
the fibers you're hitting with those
sets have already been stimulated by
previous sets and so you know after five
or six sets of dips
how much more growth can a seventh set
really add
the answer is not that much and
sometimes you can even reduce growth
because of how much you're over trading
those fibers
and digging yourself into a deep
recovery hole
but then if you switch exercise a little
bit place the focus on different fibers
et cetera
that can help you get a more complete
stimulus get more muscle growth overall
and so if volume is pretty low like
let's say you're doing five sets a week
for back which is pretty low
you obviously won't want to do more than
maybe at most two to three exercises for
back because at that point you'd
literally be doing one set per exercise
um and so i think typically the higher
volume
is for body part the more variation
you'll want in exercise selection
so yeah i think those are the main
considerations um
on to the second topic for this video
and that would be
balancing life and contest prep or in my
case
training and uh doing steps or cardio
so i think contest prep can be pretty
rough on live schedule when you consider
especially doing am pm sessions and the
sort of
lifestyle that requires
you can get away with doing not much
cardio or not many steps or not much
need
but that typically does require um a
lower energy intake
and a lower energy intake can be rough
as far as hunger management goes
and so i think typically if you do have
the time for it and
you're willing to do it getting a lot of
need in
a lot of steps in can help with hunger
management and because hunger is
probably
almost certainly the main reason people
fail accomplish prep
i think managing hunger is like the main
obstacle
so yeah in my case i'm doing around 15
000 steps a day on average
i'm training somewhere between
typically six and 10 sessions a week
which does take up a lot of time so
it's been a matter of scheduling my time
fairly well
combining my steps slash neat with
socializing um getting sort of
sometimes doing q and a's on instagram
listening to podcasts
learning stuff um
because otherwise if you do have like a
full-time job and
you're prepping for a show it can get
pretty rough as far as time management
goes
and so i think making making your cardio
double up as some sort of productive
non-lifting related um tasks as well
like for example in my case seeing
friends or um
learning stuff about research methods by
listening to podcasts
or doing a q a um that sort of stuff can
help
and it can prevent you from having
contest prep take over your life
so that's very nice um i guess the last
topics
i wanted to discuss for this video were
a considerations for meal frequency and
to be
my own diet setup and how i make it work
in practice
so i think for meal frequency and how
many meals you have a day basically
um
there are a few considerations the first
one is making sure you have
sufficient amount of meals in your day
to you know get at least two to four
high quality protein feelings with a set
amount of time between feedings
um to maximize muscle protein synthesis
or muscle growth essentially
um so that typically requires at least
i'd say three meals a day uh you can get
away with two but i probably won't
optimize muscle growth
i think a range of maybe three to six
meals was pretty well
then a second consideration is managing
hunger especially during a cut
or what have you um in my experience
and in a lot of clients experiences
unless the client is quite
muscular and has a very high food intake
or calorie intake or very high need
having fewer but slightly larger meals
tends to work out a little bit better
for hunger i think
in my experience and some clients
experiences when
we try and have more than say maybe
four or maximum five meals a day in a
deficit
it can become pretty um pretty sad as
far as meal size go
and so i think typically having
maybe three to four meals in a deficit
or while cutting
and then typically four to five
in a masking phase or in a bulk works
out pretty well
um i do think in a cut you'll need to
time your meals a little bit better than
during a bulk
during a bulk because you're in a stop
plus typically you have a bit more
protein you need anyways
and so timing your protein feedings
properly isn't super important
because since you have so much food in
your system
you'll be pretty constantly digesting
food anyways and so
even if your meal timing isn't perfect
you're still going to have a steady
titration of amino acids into the
bloodstream and so forth
and likewise for carbs where even if you
don't time your post-workout carbs
perfectly
just because you're having so many carbs
period throughout the day
and digestion doesn't take place
instantly um
you won't really start with curry so
during a cut typically you have to be
more a bit more mindful of meal timing
and
making sure you're timing your meals
properly in relation to both your
workouts and to the previous meal
so yeah i'd say three to four meals
in a deficit and maybe four to five
in a surplus maybe a bit more or a bit
less depending on circumstances but
overall i think
those guidelines tend to be pretty good
and they don't tend to
be too stressful or too impractical for
most people
which is another consideration to have
if someone's a really busy
client or person having them consume
five or six meals a day can be pretty
rough
especially if their lifestyle isn't very
bodybuilding or fitness
related if someone's quite deep into
fitness or bodybuilding
and or their family and friends are then
oftentimes they can get away with
having pretty frequent meals because
their
environment allows it and it's sort of
rewarded by their friends and everything
but if they're working a full-time job
in a very non-fitness context
having more than three or four meals a
day
can be pretty challenging just because
most
jobs or what professions lifestyles
having children etc
don't necessarily allow for having that
many meals
and so i think that's another
consideration when determining meal
frequency for a person
um i guess another consideration is also
how many sessions you're having a day
so if you have one session a day
typically you can get away with fewer
meals whereas if you're having two
sessions a day in that case
replenishing glycogen and recovering
between sessions
becomes a bit more challenging and a bit
more important and so
yeah typically that's useful i guess one
more reason why
you would want to have more meals in a
surplus versus a deficit
is because some people do struggle to
get in enough calories in a surplus
and so when you're massing
and your surplus is pretty big and your
overall calorie intake for the day
is pretty large getting in your
required calories via just say three
meals
that can make those meals really really
big and make that a real challenge to
get through
because on one hand
you do need to get in sufficient
calories across the day but at the same
time
there's only so much food you can eat at
once while let's say sit down now have a
meal
there's only so much food you can eat
now while sitting down
before you can't eat anymore your
stomach's full and what have you
and so separating those meals into
smaller but more frequent meals can sort
of give you a bit of an edge in
being able to eat those calories and so
that's one more reason why i think
in a surplus it can make sense to
have more meals than you would in a
deficit
finally i guess with that other way i'll
explain my diet setup
typically if i'm deep into a mass i'll
have
five meals a day sometimes that fifth
meal is just carbs
sometimes it is carbs and protein it
sort of depends on
um whether or not i'm trading twice a
day if i'm trained twice a day
oftentimes that fifth meal
is just like sort of carb heavy uh post
workout meal
after my first session of day um
in a deficit typically i stick to four
meals a day because i do
still have quite a bit of food overall
to eat and generally speaking
energy consumption or calorie intake
should scale with meals i think
um so the more you're eating overall the
more meals you should be having to
separate that out of
not separate divide it up in so
i have usually four or five meals a day
um depending on if i'm masking or
cutting
and then what i do is once a week i meal
prep
some protein sources and veggies
for example i have one meal that's uh
boneless sauce so with
beef mince um first vegetables tomato
sauce etc
and i prep that once a week i slow cook
it and then i store it in the fridge and
freezer
just divide it up in seven portions um
and then for carbs what i do is i have
a rice cooker in which i make either
white rice brown rice
occasionally i have a slow cooker as
well which i use for sweet potatoes
depending on typically if i'm into a
mass i'll um
into a mass sorry focus on
rice or more calorie dense carb options
but then if i'm more into a
cut where hunger is an issue then i'll
focus more so on
stuff like sweet potatoes that has a bit
lower
um calorie density and is a bit more
satiating per calorie
than rice's so yeah i have i prep those
vegetables and protein sources once a
week i store them in the fridge and
freezer
and then day to day i just prepare my
rice and or carb sources like sweet
potatoes
so that i can have them ready to go and
just eating meals like that
so typically two out of my four meals
are rice or
corn source heavy maybe three and then
one meal is like a smoothie
where i have fewer carbs um and
typically that meal is
had when having carbs isn't as important
anyways that about wraps up this video
um i hope you enjoyed the conversation
or discussion i suppose
about exercise selection called this
prep and life balance
and considerations for meal frequency
and my own light setup if you did enjoy

there'll be more on the way um
so yeah thank you for watching
