4am come on again what
what the fuck is he saying I'd say I'd
like to see a bit more eccentric control
from these Nordic curls that is the only
point of the exercise why is Mark
wearing white gloves on that Michael
Jackson workout I guess I will say that
he doesn't age this could have been
posted in 1988 and he would look the
same technique could use some work Mark
says God did stay prayed up at perform
inspired but the at is separated from
performance fired so it's actually not a
tag that link that works folks when you
post on Instagram make sure you're not
reeling off of cocaine when you do it
shit you say may make sense to nobody Mr
Mark Wahlberg all love and respect just
me shooting the bullshit
