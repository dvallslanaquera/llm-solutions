dr mike here for renaissance
prioritization
too much technique focus is a bad thing
what but is this the news lying to me
again
maybe let's find out
first of all
just to set the record straight good
technique is a good thing it allows you
to do a couple of really awesome things
first it allows you to target the
muscles that you want with precision if
you have shitty technique it's kind of
like is that your lats doing that or
your biceps or your triceps or your
quads in the fucking nose great
technique allows you to take the muscles
you want to train and target them really
really well
in addition to that
it allows you to be safer lower risk for
injury and it imposes less chronic wear
and tear on the joints holy shit win win
win win so far
in addition to that
by isolating more of the muscles you
want to use
when the exercise calls for it
it allows you to reduce the demand on
your synergist muscles reducing their
fatigue and saving them for their own
sessions if you have dog shit technique
on the bent overall and you're using
your glutes and hamstrings a lot it's
going to make your glutes and hems tired
for the day after when they have to do
their homework but if you do very strict
bent over rows with really good
technique your glutes and hams are saved
to have their own awesome session later
on
point number four lastly
if
you can have really good technique and
zap the target muscle
usually the external load how much
you're lifting can be much lower than if
you use bad technique that lower
external load with good technique allows
you to have less systemic fatigue
overall which just
keeps you training hard and hard and
hard for weeks longer allowing you to
get better at everything and become more
jacked which if you didn't check earlier
is the whole point of life now
that's all really good technique's super
important
but there are ways to take it too far
for example
in g ways i think we have
six examples
number one
worrying about
using other muscles too much
when it's not a thing you should be
worried about the grand example of this
is folks who are trying to alter their
execution their technique
their velocity
for like lateral raises or any other
kind of shoulder move because they want
to decrease the involvement of the traps
here's the thing
is your problem really that your traps
are too big
or that your delts are too small
if the problem is that your traps are
too big i feel you this is a legit
concern fucking crickets because none of
y'all motherfuckers have traps that are
too big sorry single person out of 5000
that has excessively large traps uh
you're the exception of course
if you have shoulders that aren't big
enough you don't need to be worrying
about what the fuck your traps are doing
you need to be concerned about what your
shoulders are doing and if your
shoulders are still limiting factors who
gives a shit if the traps get hit it's
like worrying about a glute pump from
squats when your target is the quads did
you also get a quad pump oh yeah was it
the best quad pump you ever had yeah so
who gives a fuck about the glute pump
your glute's too big well no i don't
care well then you're good to go is
there a way you could squat that gives
you an even bigger quad pump but less of
a glute pump squat like that but here's
the thing a lot of times
if you way overthink the technique you
end up turning the squat into more of a
sissy squat and then it targets your
quads
targets your glutes less for sure jack
we did that but then because you're no
longer stable and flat-footed and you
can't use as much load it actually
targets your quads less it doesn't allow
them to work as hard so then you kind of
kill the goose that lays the golden eggs
worry worry be more concerned about
getting a ton of juice out of the target
muscle way less concerned about oh or
other muscles also contributing as long
as that target muscle is good that's 90
of what we want anyway
point number two ways to do too much
technique focus
worrying about unrelated limb positions
this is such a fucking thing and as soon
as i tell what it is you're gonna be
like oh my god it's like half of all
exercise comments what do i do with my
toes on the bench press legit question
i've asked before in power lifting that
might be a good question because you
want to get as much hip drive as
possible into the lift
body building for like incline bench
press what do you do with your toes what
fuck are you on your mind if you're
thinking about your toes when you're
benching i can almost certainly tell you
thinking about the wrong fucking thing
you need to be thinking about two things
am i pushing the bar hard with good
technique and maybe are my upper pecs
feeling it that's it you're thinking
about your toes holy shit the fuck does
that have to do with benching
another one uh sometimes when you row
automatically when it gets hard when you
try to touch your tummy you'll curl your
forearms in this way
people are like well you shouldn't be
doing that you should be keeping your
forearm straight here's the thing
when your neural drive is maximized you
try to pull as hard as possible to
activate as many of those big ass parts
of your muscles those motor units of
your lats of your mid traps of your
erectors to fucking contract as hard as
possible your body does some automatic
shit and this is one of them if you're
gonna focus a ton on keeping your wrists
straight you're going to reduce that
central drive to your back muscles a
fuck load so what's going to happen is
yeah you're going to keep your wrist
straight but you're going to activate
maybe 80 or 90 of which you could have
gotten out of the muscles of your back
if you simply allowed your body to do
whatever the fuck it does normally and
focused on good technique and just
fucking pulling with those muscles and
okay yeah it does this bullshit at the
end
upside you get way better activity and
stimulus and growth of your target back
musculature
downside
you do this who gives a shit you ever
seen someone drop out of a program like
yeah man my back was coming up i was
rolling the world except my uh foreign
flexion just got too fatigued i tore a
bunch of tendons in here and i'm just
fucking
homeless
on the streets of san francisco it's
never fucking happened people worried
about the weirdest shit don't worry
about that other small bullshit are you
fundamentally having good technique is
your back not doing this great now
fucking pull and don't worry about the
minor shit really really really
important thing to do
another one
i've gotten this one a lot which way do
i point my feet on leg extensions or
hamstring curls like imagine like
looking at big romney or fucking you
know some other pro bodybuilder be like
oh man his hands are huge i bet he
points his toes in xyz direction fuck up
out of here your hamstrings have almost
the identical activity no matter which
way you point your toes there's not a
biomechanical reason
or just even speculative reason why that
would change a whole lot
and if that's the case set your toes
wherever the fuck you decide
and
just start curling or leg extending and
just do whatever because if during the
curl leg extension you're okay i'm using
my hamstrings but but i gotta make sure
my toes are like this or like this or
like that or like this if you worry
about that shit too much again the
central drive to your actual target
muscle is gonna reduce as you think too
much about toes don't worry your toes
won't hypertrophy point in whichever the
fuck way is comfortable and do what it
takes for the actual target muscle
another one
is worrying about concentric velocity
remember the correct answer for
concentric velocity for hypertrophy is
anything between maximum or up to like
three second concentric velocity but
some people that maximum really freaks
them out it looks to them like it's a
violation of the mind muscle connection
or they read somewhere that like reps
have to be slow for hypertrophy that's
bullshit by the way and i'll get a lot
of critique can you guys tell i'm
fucking butt hurt by the criticisms on
my own instagram so i'll do um hamstring
curls lying hamstring curls the way the
force curve is set up on the machine in
order for me to be able to touch my you
get full range of motion and touch my
heel to my ass i have to do a maximum or
close concentric velocity like so the
shit looks like this and then slow
because the slow eccentric is a good
idea boom slow boom slow and that
concentric boom a lot of people have dr
mike shouldn't you slow down why i don't
know exactly right there's no good
reason to slow down if so a lot of
people say like well i gotta curl like
this why fucking put some oomph into it
if you put oomph into it if you try to
go fast a lot of times that's a little
bit better than trying to go slow just
trying to go fast when the weight is
heavy you're tired enough that it's not
impossible really generates a fuck load
of the kind of tension that grows you
because if you're like this all the time
yeah maybe it'll work but maybe you're
not even getting close to failure
because you're so worried about being so
slow that the gym is a place of
controlled violence it's okay to fucking
let the demons out as long as
biomechanically and exercise
physiologically it's fine and it's fine
so if you want a bench
fast on the concentric fucking do it
don't worry i've got to keep my elbows
exactly like this and bench super slow
you will reduce the total activation of
the muscles you want and the growth
won't be as good plain and simple
another downside another way too much
technique focus interferes
is if you worry about ultra minor
positioning
when targeting muscles okay
what hits the lats best underhand grip
neutral grip or overhand grip
notice where all the changes are
all the changes essentially stop
at the fucking elbow
is my upper arm changing at all when i'm
doing this no it's fucking not even
moving so people are like well what kind
of grip is better for lats
with it
to a two percent detection of difference
it fucking doesn't matter so grab that
shit with whatever's comfy whatever
feels good for that month or two and
fucking go hard on it if you're like
i want to like you know some people have
the the handles that rotate
and instead of just letting
just forgetting they have hands putting
in the versa grips and just pulling with
their fucking elbows to get their back
to go
they're like okay i gotta go like this
so they're pulling hard and it's going
like this because that seems to be what
ash actually optimized the movement and
no i gotta go back in uh if you can give
a compelling reason to yourself how that
insistence on being parallel will
somehow maximize the exercise fucking
sweet do it but if you don't have a good
reason you're just really worried about
which way should i be positioned don't
fucking worry about it just pick a
position that feels comfortable it feels
like you can really contract your
muscles and use that for a while and
here's the thing people are always
looking for the optimal well is this
going to get me more jacked or this or
this all three you can do one for one
month one for another month and one for
month after and then recycle there's
nobody stopping you
next
avoiding lockouts
because well you know
the lockout it's bad because
the bones
we already have a video on this avoiding
lockouts is fucking stupid unless it's a
good idea
for an actual reason
not just because reasons actual good
reasons if you don't have one don't
worry about avoiding lockouts lock out
to your heart's content
lastly and this is a huge one this
consider this its own section
a lot of folks who are doing a lot of
this kind of stuff super overly
concerned with technique
what they do is as their loads get
heavier or as they approach failure more
closely over the weeks
they'll start to feel like their
technique is falling apart now mind you
to 99 out of 100 external observers it
looks fucking just fine
nonsense it's off
what they'll do is they'll say okay i'm
currently 80 pounds 80 pounds goes well
85 goes well 90. it feels off i'm gonna
go back down to 80. no no i'm going to
go to 75 so i can really get the
technique right and then work my way
back up that kind of paranoia and that
need to renorm your loads all the time
to feel the good technique again
literally prevents progression
it makes you stay well shy of failure
and well shy of challenging loads for a
much larger fraction of your training
than if you just push it and try to
conserve your technique into the
stratosphere of heavy loads and close to
failure training
you just get less done that way and less
of a stimulus like how many guys who are
paranoid about technique and constantly
take their squat back down to just the
bar have fucking enormous legs
there's a reason for that they're by
design not trying to get enormous legs
because they're freaking out all the
fucking time
all right
so if you do a ton of this then we all
do it to some extent even myself
as
as immaculate and mistake-free i am in
the gym
huge downside
you're gonna reduce your top-end motor
unit recruitment like the biggest
gnarliest parts of your muscle that grow
the most you may not even activate them
or hardly activate them at all and thus
your most growth prone muscle fibers end
up missing out you just don't get as
jacked
big downside number one
big downside number two is you cut your
progression short because you're
constantly renorming when anything is
heavy enough or close to failing enough
to really challenge your technique
and
you renorm every time and it leads to
less muscle growth over time than you
could have had now mind you in most
cases you'll still get more jacked
you'll still get stronger but there'll
be an alternate you in the universe and
if the universe never collide that
motherfucker will bitch slap you back to
the ground because he's more jacked
because he did what it took instead of
being super paranoid about excessive
technique shit
now
okay i just talk shit for like 20
minutes
how do we become better at this well how
do we avoid these things simply not
doing them maybe not good enough so
here's the deal
first
before you do any technique before you
plug in and go for a set
reduce your cognitive load you're not
thinking about shit that has any
technical relationship to not increasing
your stimulus to fatigue ratio
so if you're like hey which way do i put
my feet on hamstring curls i'm like
which way have you tried like a bunch of
different ways i got you are any of
those reliably more stimulative or
reliably less fatigue like no
then it probably doesn't matter
okay
so then so then just don't think about
it put your feet where the fuck is comfy
and don't even think about it think
about your i got an idea hamstrings and
the rest of your technique and how hard
you're working instead of that shit
because as soon as you eliminate
thinking about shit you don't have to
think about your job in thinking about
technique and doing a good job in the
set is 50 times easier so first
take away all the shit that's that's
needless that has nothing to do with the
actual muscles being involved or there's
no uh impingement on them which way do i
hold the fucking lamp pull down who
gives a shit pick one stick to it
next
focus on your technique
super well
at the entire time during the set
but before that
set your technique up in your head of
what you're gonna do
lat pull down okay i'm gonna pull to my
sternum i'm gonna stay mostly upright
i'm gonna be big stretch at the top
big contraction and
clavicles down at the bottom everything
down and then back up okay okay i know
what i'm doing because if you know your
technique ahead of time you don't have
to like invent new technique concerns
halfway through the set like oh should
it be keeping my knees in know
everything you're gonna have to do and
then it's easy for you to just do it
when the set comes so rehearse ahead of
time
then when you're doing this set push
each set hard
what that is guaranteed to do is two
things one get you jacked
middle finger
and two
it's guaranteed to get your technique to
start slipping
at various times when the fatigue hits
you during the set
it's gonna start slipping here's the
challenge and the next point as your
technique slips
during
the end of the set or during heavier
loads or even in the middle
focus on bringing it back
how the fuck do you do that
within each set you can bring back to
good technique by slowing your eccentric
hitting the right positions on the
eccentric
forcefully coming back on the concentric
and maybe locking out for a second
taking a little bit of a shake like so
for example
if you're close grip benching
and your shit is flaring way too much
and that's no bueno
finish the wrap
all right reorganize
still the set come down elbows and
elbows and elbows and elbows in push
elbows and elbows
in and i'm up and then down back again
if your technique breaks down during a
set there's no reason to think that you
can take a quick little rest at the top
or bottom of a rep or even take kind of
a mental break by slowing the eccentric
to be like okay when the concentric
starts again i'm going to push the right
way not the wrong way boom you can
always bring yourself back right you
don't do this by slowing down the
concentric or by stopping the center
point technique was off you can make
adjustments on the fly it's not that you
can make in order to be a high level
trainee in order to get your best
muscular gains you have to do it on the
fly like the perfect rocket to be shot
to go to mars or some shit doesn't just
get that angle completely correct from
the beginning and just shoot in a
straight line there's always adjustments
here's the deal when you're when you're
firing a rocket it's
all this thrust going you're a million
pounds of thrust the other direction
that's fucking chaos you still have to
make adjustments in that case they don't
slow the fucking rocket down to make the
turns the rocket's speeding up and they
still make the term that's how you have
to think of your training
that's why going doing good technique is
so fucking hard
that's why it's so impressive when big
guys with a shitload of weight still do
good technique
is because it's a constant battle to
rain the technique back in and there's
nothing wrong with that
you don't do it by stopping the set you
don't do it by slowing down the
concentric you do it by slowing down the
eccentric and maybe taking a little bit
of a breather between
reps and going again reminding yourself
what has to be done
between sets so you finish a set and
your technique was good it got a little
out of hand but then you brought it back
between sets
note what positions you have to have and
take note what technique you have to
execute in order to have an even better
next set be like okay rep number five my
elbow started flaring now i'm gonna be
on the lookout for that so all the reps
after rep three i'm gonna be like elbows
in elbows in and your next set is 50
times better so not only are you good at
managing technique within the set
between sets you're prepared you take
notes from the set before you prepare to
do better on the set afterwards
and
your progressions meaning you know five
more pounds every week a wrap here and
there every week
they should end due to a very excessive
fatigue right or a very poor mind muscle
connection or a very crappy stimulus to
fatigue ratio they should not end
because your technique breaks down
to paraphrase chad wesley smith
phenomenal powerlifting coach and
strength coach in general
when you're lifting your heaviest
ideally is when your technique should be
the best
the idea that oh well i'm going hard and
heavy the technique breaks down bullshit
it wants to break down and stuff for you
to bring it back
if you're ending your progressions like
yeah put five pounds in the bar here and
there but like it got too heavy my
technique broke down
no
you put more weight on the bar and maybe
your mind muscle connection started to
deteriorate maybe your stimulus fatigue
ratio started to rate try to get them to
come back good technique
but if they don't they yeah okay shit's
too heavy shit's too out of hand i'm
gonna stop doing this exercise stop
progressing maybe like progress slower
or maybe choose another exercise and go
totally fine
your technique
at least as externally visible
anywhere between five reps and 30 reps
should basically look the fucking same
i wave my own flag here but some of the
comments i get on the instagram when i
post my actual training videos is like i
can't tell if this is like a gif on a
loop or like you're actually training
every time i see that i'm like oh that's
nice to hear because you should be like
a fucking machine and the only thing
stopping you should be the load itself
not the fact that you're like oh my
technique broke down when i go this
heavy
doesn't matter how you go your technique
should always be excellent it should be
a matter of personal pride for you to
push that and here's the last
the last word on this and it's very
pithy watch out
good technique
only helps you grow muscle
if it survives the foray
the movement into hard training
that should be your goal to develop
excellent technique and an ability to
control it
that you can actually use to train hard
with
if you are the world's best sniper
when there's no chance of you receiving
enemy fire or getting discovered
and then when you become
when you are put into a combat scenario
and you completely break down
you're not the world's best sniper
you're the world's best uh competitive
entertainment shooter or something
the real world's best sniper
they're accurate when there's people
looking for them bombs going off shells
flying by and they still fucking hit the
target that's how you have to view your
technique the purpose of good technique
isn't to look good in your warm-ups in
the first couple reps and then when you
try to go hard it breaks down you go oh
shit i guess i better go light again
what light for what you're not going to
get jacked like that the real way to get
jacked just to have excellent technique
and as you go closer to failure and the
weight gets heavier your technique stays
and it stays and it fades away and you
bring it back and it stays and it gets
better over time
that's how you get jacked challenge
yourself bring the realistic technique
not as other bullshit fluff that gets
the job done under control with hard and
heavy training if you can do that see
you at the top of mount jacked that's
all i had to finish it off see you guys
next time
