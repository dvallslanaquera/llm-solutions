but this idea that you should only
perform the exercises you enjoy
or that every set of every workout
should be fun okay if your goal is to
maximize your potential and achieve the
best results that you can
then that is straight up [ __ ]
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to give you
seven signs that you yes you
are not training hard enough in the gym
if you want to gain muscle to your full
potential
and these are not going to be technical
things related to rpe or rir
or progressive overload and they have
nothing to do with muscle pump or burn
or soreness
since for the most part those are not
reliable indicators for effective
hypertrophy
training okay today i want to just give
you some simple direct signs okay subtle
things based on
my own lifting experience and from
coaching other people and just from
observing other people in the gym that
indicate that you probably aren't
pushing yourself hard enough
and that you need to dig a bit deeper
and increase your overall effort level
and since effort is the primary factor
it's the most
uh baseline stimulus for gaining muscle
that everything else gets built on top
of
it's critical that you make sure that
your effort level is landing in the
right zone
otherwise you might just be wasting your
time altogether or at the very least
progressing at a much slower rate than
you're truly capable of and
some of these might sound a little bit
weird but i'm being 100 serious with all
of these
and let me know down below in the
comments as you watch this if you agree
with these
or if you have any to add of your own
all right the first sign that you're not
training hard enough
is that you're performing your sets
without any moment of pause beforehand
so maybe you're thinking about something
unrelated or you're checking your phone
or you're
having a conversation with someone in
the gym or whatever and then without any
hesitation you just grab the weight and
start pumping out your reps
now if you're truly training with the
level of focus and the level of effort
that's necessary
for optimal muscle growth then you
shouldn't be just mindlessly jumping
into your sets like
that you should need a brief moment to
pause
to clear your mind to mentally prepare
for what you're about to do
and to establish exactly what your goal
is with the upcoming set so what did you
do in the previous workout for this
particular set
and what is your goal this time you know
which muscles are you trying to target
are there any form cues that you need to
remind yourself of here
how close to failure are you aiming to
go i'm not saying that you need to
analyze every set to death
but there should be a quick you know
5-10 second mental preparation before
each set
where you're clearing your head of
distractions and you're honing in on
exactly what it is that you're trying to
accomplish
the second sign that you're not training
hard enough is that you never feel any
sense of
nervousness at all before any of your
sets in my opinion if you're really
truly exerting yourself with a high
enough level of effort
then on at least some sets some of the
time or even entire workouts some of the
time
you should feel a little bit anxious
beforehand because you know that what
you're about to do is going to be very
difficult and very
uncomfortable if i'm about to do say a
high rep
compound leg exercise to failure or even
just very close to failure
i genuinely feel nervous before i do
that i'll usually have to sit there
for a little bit to gather myself and
you know get just the right song on my
playlist
my heart rate will noticeably increase
before i even start the set
because i know that this is going to be
really physically and mentally tough so
if you can't relate at all to what i
just said
you know if you never feel that
sensation ever if you're always just
perfectly happy and content
to perform your next set regardless of
the exercise or the muscle group or
how much weight you're lifting then
you're probably not training hard enough
in the overall picture
for maximum gains now i'm not saying you
should feel this way all the time
but on at least some sets some of the
time especially on those big compound
exercises especially for leg training
where
you're going really close to failure or
even all the way to failure or you know
maybe where you're going for some sort
of
important pr unless you're a legit
masochist who enjoys pain
you should be a little bit anxious at
least some of the time the third sign
that you're not training hard enough
is that you've never been in enough
discomfort on those last few reps of a
set
where the thought enters your mind why
the [ __ ] am i doing this to myself
is this even worth it now some people
might not agree with this one you know
if you just genuinely have insane levels
of motivation
and very high pain tolerance and gaining
muscle is an all-consuming passion for
you
then maybe you never question things at
all but in my experience
i know i'm really giving my all when
sometimes here and there the physical
and mental discomfort
reaches a high enough level to where my
brain basically just gets hijacked by it
and starts pumping out all these
conflicting thoughts to try to get me to
stop you know why are you doing this to
yourself
just put the weight down and rest give
yourself a break this isn't necessary
etc i think if you really are genuinely
training hard
that mental battle should be taking
place every now and then
just a general sort of internal conflict
where one side of your mind is urging
you to stop this madness
and the other side is saying no we're
going forward no matter what and to
where you really have to dig down deep
to get this side to win the fourth sign
that you're not training hard enough
and this one might sound a bit goofy but
i'm actually dead serious here
and that's that you're not making ugly
ass faces on the last rep or two of your
sets at least on your more challenging
heavier compound movements i really
think that if you're able to keep your
face totally relaxed
and you're just chilling all the way
through and you don't need to grimace
and
contort your expression and sort of grit
your teeth because of the discomfort
that you're going through and because
you're really trying to reach down and
find that strength to get those last
couple
uh very difficult reps then those reps
aren't really that difficult to begin
with
if it's truly difficult then it should
pretty much be an automatic reaction
that you can't even help again at least
on the more challenging exercise all
right the fifth sign that you're not
training hard enough
and this is along the same lines as the
previous one and it might sound even
more out there
but again i'm being quite serious and
that's that you never let out
let's call it involuntary primal sounds
of any kind during your sets
[Music]
now please don't be the guy grunting
loudly across the gym on every single
rep of your workout
including your concentration curls
because you think that it makes you
appear hardcore
but i think that if you're truly
training hard if you're really pushing
your limits and having to
exert yourself with maximum force to
keep that weight moving
there should be some reps of some sets
here and there where some type of
involuntary grunt or curse word or other
primal utterance or at least an
abnormally large gasp or a sigh of some
kind
automatically exits your body without
you even thinking about it
the sixth sign that you're not training
hard enough and this ties in with the
last few points
but it's something that i commonly hear
on youtube and social media and it's
this idea that
the best training program is the one you
enjoy the most or
if your training isn't fun then you're
doing it wrong or something along those
lines
now yes there's absolutely some truth to
that okay if you genuinely hate every
workout that you're doing
then unless you're some extreme type a
hyper motivated outlier
it's a hot [ __ ] nice heatwave
mother nature's a pissed off
[ __ ] but guess what so am i
so who gives a [ __ ] you're probably not
going to stick to it and yes you should
strive to make your training
as enjoyable as you reasonably can to
get the practical result that you're
after
but this idea that you should only
perform the exercises you enjoy
or that every set of every workout
should be fun okay if your goal is to
maximize your potential and achieve the
best results that you can
then that is straight up [ __ ] for
any major life goal that you want to
achieve whether it's in the realm of
physical fitness
or business slash career or athletics or
whatever else
you are going to have to do some things
that you don't want to do things that
are not fun
things that are not enjoyable things
that straight up suck
balls if all of these processes were fun
and enjoyable all the time
then everybody would be out there
walking around peeled and shredded year
round
that's just not how things work in
reality again if your goals
are more on the general health and
fitness side you know to achieve a
decent physique and some decent strength
gains
that's totally fine and yeah you can
probably make the vast majority of your
training fun
in that case but if we're talking about
those people who really want to push the
envelope
and take their bodies up into let's say
that top one to two percent zone
i would say that if you're genuinely
enjoying every set of every exercise of
every workout
then you're just training too far within
your comfort zone and then the last time
that you're not training hard enough
relates to after the workout is over so
how do you feel do you truly feel
like you gave your best effort can you
clearly feel that the muscles you worked
are uh significantly disrupted from what
you just did
do you feel a clear sense of mental
accomplishment was the workout
uh difficult enough that you're actually
looking forward to going home and
relaxing now
in my experience i can tell a lot about
my effort level based on
the sort of general feel of that
post-workout period if i
really truly push myself hard then
usually once the workout is finished
i'll feel a pretty strong post-workout
high you know those feel-good endorphins
will really be flowing
i'll actually be glad that the workout
is over i know that i did enough so
there's no sense that maybe i could have
done more i just know that i'm done
and all i want to do now is go home and
eat and chill out basically
and when i do go home to eat and chill
out that post-workout high
is still going and i just feel generally
accomplished and happy with the effort
that i gave
now this is something that's obviously
going to vary depending on what exact
workout you're doing
you know whether it's a heavy lower body
day let's say versus whatever
maybe your easiest workout for the week
is and it might vary depending on where
you are
in a training cycle but you get the
general point here after your workout
do you really feel like you worked out
or do you just feel like it was a minor
blip in your day
and you could just go ahead and do a
bunch more physical activity right after
if it's the latter then you're probably
not training hard enough
um there should be an obvious sensation
in the hours after your workout that you
significantly
threw off your body's regular mode of
functioning uh for lack of a better term
