man down you gotta leave you gotta leave
him behind ethan let's go
this is like a roller coaster that just
killed one person but now you're getting
strapped in
hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
i'm here with a few fun friends you may
not recognize
ethan suplee actor known remembered
for such titles as remember the titans
except
he's lost a whole bunch of weight and
gained a crapload of muscle and that's
given him a big ass ego
to try to step to charlie he said i want
to train
legs with a bodybuilder and we gave him
like a regular small body but he's like
no
he swiped him aside he's like charlie he
goes i want charlie
he got it so now they're gonna go
toe-to-toe head-to-head
crazy psycho leg workout i can't
administer something like this by myself
so our buddy jared feather here is going
to help us
bring the pain say goodbye
to ethan simply
[Music]
all right folks first exercise up today
is the lying leg curl get the hamstrings
out of the way early
not necessarily the best or worst idea
it's just an option
it lets us get the quads in later
because a lot of times after super hard
quads you're just not doing anything
anymore
hamstrings first with a nice isolation
movement doesn't mess with the quad
training much
it's a great hit great stimulus to
fatigue ratio for hamstrings we're going
to be looking for a full range of motion
reps very very close to failure oh
rep range just 10 to 20 we'll see where
they fall i give like ethan like a 50 50
shot today of surviving
or dying right on floor we'll see so tap
the butt control on the way down that's
it
like i said i think it might have been a
little too high on your on your ankles
see where it's at on this yeah you might
have just you might need to screw
forward on the pad a little bit
i don't know if you got a new battery at
all damn ethan's cabs are on a whole
different level freaking huge yeah there
you go
you can move forward even more there you
go
beautiful you don't have to hold it up
there just gentle touch
boom that's it yeah i have an advanced
directive
there will be no resuscitation
three four
five you gotta charlie twelve let's go
thirteen let's go two more fourteen last
one touch that butt
good rest for a second rest rest
two go rest
one go touch
that's it good job
no i'm not saying i would rather be dead
that's not what i'm saying at all
don't hurt me you mean what ethan
nobody's coming to help you it's just
you and the in the leg curl that's it
two don't don't speed it up let's go
three
quality yes four
come on control that e-cigarette come on
you gotta five
rest for a second rest two go
one and last one up yeah
that's it very good very good
so that was kind of the warm-up for the
workout because the leg presses next
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so what we're going to do is they're
going to perform a certain amount of
reps and it's going to be relatively
close to failure
by that time that they get pretty close
to failure we're going to pause at the
top lock the knees out no rack
do a few more and repeat that process
until we get a rep achievement
so there's a certain rep achievement on
the set we're trying to hit that and
we're going to rest pause until we get
there yep in this case it's basically
sets of
well the first one's going to be like 30
and then ass fatigue falls off
so essentially we're flirting with
failure four or five times during
a single set that is a massive massive
hit if you're gonna count the sets wise
make sure to auto regulate
two or three sets of rest pause is not
the same thing as two straight sets
it's the same thing as maybe five or six
these guys are in for it let's do it
do you get nauseous when you train like
some things sometimes okay then you're
definitely gonna notice that
i just you know i already feel it
eight nine
rest go
one two
three four
rest four
one two
three one more come on let's go
rest that's 24 30 is the goal
yes charlie yes let's go three one
two come on motherfucker we said three
push rest
two one
two more and you're done two more and
you're not gonna fucking reach for the
fucking handles
yeah one more
oh hell yeah that's what's up
trying to escape his body
no no no yeah yeah this is good
so this is going to be high reps for him
which is good
then you're definitely getting nauseous
today
man down you got to leave you got to
leave him behind ethan let's go
this is like a roller coaster that just
killed one person and now you're getting
strapped in
internal cues there you go much better
just a little deeper
yes seven control
eight nine
rest open all the way up i'm not gonna
fuck with you hey
go out motherfucking did i stutter go
one deep two there's no rush it's
training
let's go three excellent
four find a way come on ethan five find
a way to get these fucking reps
six let's go ethan
seven deep
breathe rest ethan training not moving
quality four go quality
[Music]
yes one get deep
two come on now three
control on the way down go control yes
breathe you have two more two when
you're done you gotta go deep ethan
but we're not counting them only
counting the good ones come on two left
yes one beautiful last one
up push wrap
[Music]
ethan that's fucking awesome that was
good shit
probably one of the best sets i've seen
at lake brest oh yeah sure
let us collect ourselves for squatting
hey what do you mean you're not going to
make it i mean you're on team
bodybuilder
fuck are you going to lose to an actor
he's faking all of this
how about i fake that i win no he's
better at baking than you
because you're not you're not an actor
scott you edit this okay
there's only so much we can do on an
editing room floor
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
third exercise is a squat we're doing a
safety squat bar just because charlie's
really jacked and has trouble grabbing
the regular bar at this point uh here's
the deal
sets of roughly five to ten reps why
because at this point they're so
fatigued their quads are so beat up
that they get close to failure real soon
with a relatively light weight
so we're gonna focus on really really
good techniques finish off a great
workout with a couple of sets of squats
super deep super strict let's do a good
job
[Music]
two you want to stop all the way at the
bottom
three very good
four very good eating no valgus
yes big chest come on
yes six gotta pause and we won't count
them
up seven right here gotta get ten

[Music]
[Applause]

[Music]
up fuck the bar let's go
up
[Music]
up
well folks we tried to kill
ethan and charlie one of ethan's clones
for sure died
maybe a few charlie well
you've seen the tape he did a fine job i
don't know who won this but i think
i think jared and i are pretty sure
nobody wins these things
i think we won we definitely won by not
doing
a fucking thing it's so easy to say go
do one more rep
anyway before anyone calls us out folks
thank you so much thanks so much for
even and charlie
ethan got a great chance to train with a
real bodybuilder
we'll ask him in a bit how he feels
about that
there's definitely a 10 on the
not working out as a zero five as the
average tennis psychosis this was a ten
i listen i i feel slightly guilty
admitting this but i
work out on my own and i don't
know that i ever pushed myself this hard
this was
really tough you know the workout was
hard um
i hated it uh felt like i lost a little
by myself
seven out of ten seven out of ten yeah
he did great he did great yeah he kept
up he actually did an extra set then
i did so you know props to him you know
he manned up it's the last weight
it's fine though it's all it's all
relative my man all right
but yeah no that was fun it was great we
got a good workout in
uh i feel so vulnerable right now with
him saying that was a seven
so if you ever feel like you want to
give up in the middle of the set
this is what i think you're already
there you're already doing it
do you want to throw away the last few
reps you did finish off strong do it
that's it that's all there is to it just
do it you cry about afterwards
