three one more bonus round
oh my god god sitting this one out
hey folks i'm here with joe sulliman and
brianna taylor
[Laughter]
hey folks clearly i'm dr mike
joe sullivan world record holding power
lifter brianni terry
also a world record holding power lifter
and guess what
love is in the air because they're
together
i guess physically also together at
various times in the privacy of their
own home but here's the deal
to quote the great philosopher ja rule
love
is about pain anyone care to do a jaw
rule impression quickly
anyway i think it's just a lot of
grunting yeah what does he do he's the
guy that
uh yeah anyway
where's ashantia that's what i want to
know in any case we'll look for ashanti
while we're doing a mega crazy psycho
girl versus boy
lover vs lover arm workout to death
these folks are both elite power lifters
so when we set arm workout they looked
confused and wandered around aimlessly
for a while
because they didn't know they had arms
today bodybuilding strikes back
and love turns into death let's get it
done
[Music]
hey folks all right so first exercise
for arms is going to be skull crushers
we actually do triceps first because
with sufficiently muscular people
if you pump up the bicep a lot first it
actually limits the range of motion on
triceps which isn't that great
triceps first then biceps not a hard
rule it's something interesting to
follow
skull crushers we're going to go for
sets of 10 to 15
straight sets relatively heavy we're
gonna go for it oh
auto regulate two to four sets per
person and then after that we're gonna
move on to our next tricep exercise
which will be light and i'll talk to you
guys about
that then see you then all the way to
the chin
and up go one more you got one more i'm
right here with you
i think i can upgrade row 95 let's go
maybe
slow slow press
more one more let's go joe elbows in
gentle touch big press one more
let's go elbows in
that's what we call zero rir very good
very good
very good good stuff can i lift my head
or is that cheating
you shouldn't lift your head because he
was cheating he was doing that he was
cheating just a little
bit good no bullshit swinging around
straight press linear yes
again go go go go go
great start we're just getting started
bree let's do it
press press good more
slow slow control press
one more at least easy all fucking day
elbows in
go and that's it good stuff
very good very good raise my head like a
bitch
oh this is getting personal
new rp service rp divorce court you feel
me for when shit doesn't go well in
training
so check this out joe your max bench
is he has benched 507 pounds in
competition
that requires very strong triceps with
the very specific technique we're using
on skull crushers
this motherfucker is using 95 pounds
total for sets of 10 to 15
two reasons for that one it's a new
exercise for him
and the neural learning patterns can
catch up quick he'd be at 135 plus
within a few weeks
however he's not going to be at 200 plus
or whatever the fuck because a lot of
people think they skull crush a lot
because they do the shit wrong if you
keep your elbows in if you go all the
way down to slow control you don't need
much weight
so if you think you're stronger than joe
fuck it use more weight than this but
you're probably not
so use better weight and use good
technique you're the fucking man let's
do it
elbows in stable
and up good one more high quality
elbows in elbows in
in in in in i'm with you go
go go one more last one you know i gotta
fuck with you elbows in
in in in triceps
touch gentle
[Music]
isn't that funny being just fucking rag
dog
four joe got ten
five slow
six
[Music]
you got this do your best slow
up up
joe's not joe's not mic'd up but he
wanted me to tell you guys something
just so
to make this seem fair joe has like a
weird medical condition
which throws him off balance it's
because his his um
genitals are so big that it's hard for
him to balance and which is why his
strength on the skull crusher is not
that great i have to lift my head
otherwise like i'll i'll get in a uh
inguinal
hernia it's and the kids used to make
fun of him when he was younger like why
do you have like
like a fucking gallon of milk down there
like what the fuck is going on
and it's a tough life but he got big and
strong to protect his
inner soft gigantic genitals with an
outer shell of toughness
all right folks so overhead tricep
extension machine thingy
this brand is by arsenal which usually
makes incredible equipment
joe and bree are going to do something a
little interesting today they already
have their heavy lower at work
this is going to be for higher reps the
first set they're going to do
is going to be like oh somewhere between
10 and 20 usually 15 and 20.
then without a whole lot of rest maybe
five seconds i'm gonna change
the clip for them to go something like
two-thirds the load
which gives them an extra five or so
reps to really burn it in
it allows us to flirt with failure for
longer it allows for the metabolites to
build up higher
you know all the good things about
growth get magnified a little bit
not anything super magical just an
interesting way to trade every now and
again
we're only going to do three sets on
this because it's really like six sets
because each one counts for like
well it's like four sets or something
like that or five cents because each
counts for like one and a half steps or
something like that
one more joe slow slow
slow up up
rack
right away five last five of triceps is
the last reps of triceps
slow one all the way down and a nice
pause
no rush good
[Music]
three take your time
slow
up up up up that's it that's the last
one
very good very good very good
[Laughter]
you're like you're like purple
there's no blood
holy shit oh that's all right last set
bree
joe please do the honors plus the
business 40 when she get right
why do people say that i don't know why
can't your second set be your best year
first up
very good slow
[Music]
up two more don't look up there's
nothing to see up there
good elbows elbows
up and one more slow
up yes stop controlled
four four one
two good technique you can try hard just
do a good technique
three and last one of the day slow
touch up good
beautiful beautiful beautiful
very good
not like that folks who did better on
triceps
some of these folks might have had
better technique some
reach closer to failure some might have
done objectively more
load and or reps but the only way you
really figure out who did better is to
hit a side tricep right now
and let you decide whatever i don't even
know how to decide there you go
yeah oh yeah why not
all right i think that solves it
all right here's the deal folks we have
a few things
world-class power lifter world-class
power lifter
barbell squat rack
yes we are curling in the squat rack
what's your best squat
uh 480. 480 best squat and yours is
8 22 8 22. i feel like if anyone's going
to talk that shit
about curling in the spot rack they're
nowhere to be found so let's get it in
bicep time yeah yeah let's do it ready
yeah
yeah yeah you guys are curling machines
i got no critiques
hard to fuck this up i don't know people
fuck it up all the time
curls are gonna be done for like oh
three or four sets
about 10 to 15 reps per set roughly nice
heavy stimulus
later we'll do some cable stuff that'll
be higher up more drop sets etc
so let's get the heavy work done yeah
slow
rest last one
slow
and rack good job
good stuff very good i mean you look
good man you know like
whatever bree whatever you know like my
wife and i are looking for a third so
like
these are excellent excellent excellent
excellent
that was less than excellent control the
shit
good like a machine not an athlete like
a machine good
all the way down rest just one more but
it has to be good
yes slow slow
slow slow wrapped
[Music]
ah it goes from like okay this is
good that's bullshit yeah well you did
the bullshit part
yeah yo what up scott video guy
kind of looking good baby my wife and i
were
kind of looking for a third so you know
what i'm saying
great two more
rest two
good and one right now
slow one last one
go
good stuff very good stuff
yep elbows right in the hips awesome
good slow
good now is when we start to focus
no swinging only biceps good
one more before we rest only biceps
good slow rest for a second
talk your elbows go
what the fuck was that
yo bree you know what i'm saying joe
whatever fuck him
my wife and i are kind of looking for a
third so uh yeah
[Music]
the drop set it's a fun technique it
works really well
usually save it for like one time per
training session
every few mesocycles what you want to do
is we're going to do as many curls as it
takes to get to between 10 and 15
reps very hard probably failure or very
close
we're going to descend one weight down
the stack
and with less than five seconds rest
we're going to proceed
until they're good and ready
nice and cooked usually about three to
six of these is good
an interesting uh thing is if you get
low enough on weight
you end up just getting tired
neurologically but you can sort of like
still move it around
so true failure doesn't even really
happen and at that point you're hardly
recruiting any motor units anyway so
we're gonna do like three to six of
these
it's gonna be really fun time and
remember here with curls with cables
because there's stuff you can't do with
free weights
we wanna make sure we do the nice arc
out so we're actually going to start
with the bar in front of us
and we're going to arc like this to the
face and then control slow
i'm going to arc and control slow
and that will lead to lots of pain and
then jacked arms and then friends and
happiness
one more go yeah so
that's it a good rest breathe
[Music]
when minimum four one
control two all the way down

yep three rest at the bottom for a sec
