hey folks Dr Mike here from Renaissance
periodization and I'm here to talk to
you about the stupidest reason I've ever
personally heard for using steroids and
that is to try to get girls
this presentation is entirely
hypothetical
because I have never seen a girl in real
life let alone gotten the uh
ones to go talk to her I assume that's
what you do the girls but any case I
digress here's the thing
there are tons of bad reasons to do
steroids and many people maybe most use
them for terrible reasons but I had a
question on a recent video that really
just you ever read something on the
Internet and just goes like right into
your fucking brain and you're like ah
committee about this so here's the video
it was a video of one of the earlier
ones we made about steroid downsides and
trade-offs and costs and all this bad
stuff and you're gonna you know die
sooner and you're gonna be dumber and
someone was like yeah for sure I feel
all that but I actually have the quote
here I want to use them because I want
to get female attention like the jacked
guys at my gym seem to get
oh boy
this is so off base
this assumption and this logic that I
had to make a video about it because
believe it or not humblebrag not so
humble brag coming up I'm the most
jacked guy at most gyms unless I'm at
like Dragon's Lair where there's all
pros and I'm not exactly women in the
sea of you know what
clearly it is because I'm five foot one
that's my official height God decided to
put various parts of my faith where they
don't belong
but
I do have some insight on this
and it's one of these things where you
see someone genuinely wholeheartedly
believing something that couldn't be
further from the truth in this case rare
forever very far from the truth I just
had to say something so here we go here
we go here we go the big question here
a couple of questions off is will
getting more muscular get you more
female attention
very generally the answer is yes
but
huge butt maybe that's the kind of girls
you're into huh comedy
it's
just by a bit more on average
female attention from being jacked
versus not jacked it's a small change
and it's only to a point and that point
is if you gain a certain amount of
muscle and then gaining past that you
actually get into the neutral zone of
the last 10 pounds of muscle you put on
had no effect on how much you were
pulling in and then after that it's
actually less and less it gets tougher
to get laid as you get more and more
checked
on average of course
another very interesting thing that I'm
gonna this is a hill I'm gonna fucking
die on
I mean technically I'm a scientist so I
have to say all of these are tentative
conclusions and I will absolutely change
them in light of better reasoning and
evidence but I think there's some good
reason and evidence here
the point of peak male attractiveness
physique wise
for the average hot girl and what she
prefers let's say in the modern Western
world
for sure in the Asian world because
Asian girls tend to like guys that are
significantly less muscular
is achievable
by the vast majority of people within
five years of completely drug-free
training
just to Anchor this in your mind okay
because I will give reasons and blah
blah blah in specific numbers and a
second we'll get into this but if you're
having trouble believing this you are
part of a subculture Fitness which is
different
very very different and we can get some
Illusions as to about what is that most
people like
it matters a shitload to you that you're
jacked and shredded and veiny in the gym
and you're looking in the mirrors but
the girls around you in the gym are at a
uh Scott's video where where do people
meet girls when they talk to women
bars clubs disco texts
saloons
getting an old Wild West here get shot
it's kind of hot fished with some guns
in any case
regular people regular hot girls even
Fitness hot girls
think that Brad Pitt from Fight Club is
like
the bee's knees
he's like heroin thin fuck I'm starting
to sound like coach Greg over here Brad
Pitt you got his that is not an he's not
a jacked guy
at all and if you look at all the
celebrities that females like the most
oh let's see Justin Bieber could just
straight walk into a fucking crowd and
be like you you and you my place now for
casual sex and they'd be like ah bro
Justin Bieber weighs like my fucking leg
does we are in a mass delusion in the
fitness Community about what it is that
is Peak attractive for the purposes of
attracting females in this case if
you're a male if you're female
and you're watching this you see a
better uses of your time just on to the
next I ain't got nothing to say it's
gonna sound nicer be pleasant or even
makes sense in any case
here's the thing
if you're about six feet tall
all you have to weigh at a relatively
lean around 10 body fat
is
175 pounds or so
and that's pretty fucking close
to what the average hot girl thinks is
the hottest physical shape for a guy now
I didn't say anything about the face or
the income or the personality we'll get
to that later well I say two things I
know about each one of those and we move
on
with just on physique alone it doesn't
take much
now if you want to get bigger than that
by 10 or 20 pounds it's probably going
to yield about the same amount of female
interest or appreciation just uh in a
different way like oh like hey what do
you think about Connor like he's kind of
he's kind of big but I like that like
that's like 180 190 or whatever
at six feet if you get to above 200
and keep going relatively lean you're
into like the muscle fetish girls that
really like Jack guys but like they're a
small fraction of all attractive girls
that you probably into and the
attractive girls that are not muscle
fetishes they're like less and less
inclined to believe that you are very
attractive anymore and it'd be like hey
like what do you think of like Connor
and they're like I don't know he kind of
looks like the rock is like too bad
direct quote all right so
let's try some other Heights I ran the
numbers on this here's how it looks
this is going to potentially shock you
but here we go
150 pound male physique at five foot six
that's how tall I am IRL that gets you
an ffmi of about 21.8 which is like damn
near Five Points below where they start
to think you might be taking steroids
this is not an overly jacked individual
fat-free mass index by the way for folks
who want to Google that
at five foot six so if you're five six
which is my height weird
if you're around 150 pounds lean you're
kind of in that zone of what the average
girl who likes guys and is attracted to
them seems to think is probably really
best now an average is a huge bandwidth
tons of different kinds of girls no
worries but if you're really like gonna
take steroids to improve your physique
to get the girls they get at least got
to be shooting for the highest volume of
girls possible you can be odd to take
steroids to get like this one percent of
really weird girls and if you're into
that hey fucking juice up fuck and fuck
off whatever but if you're really
serious about like I just want attention
from females you could have the logical
thing to do is to become as attractive
as you can be to as many people as
possible and that means if you happen to
be five foot six which is never grew
into an adult height like me
all you do is you weigh 150 pounds with
some ABS okay about 10 body fat and that
already puts you into above average
muscularity
150 a five six
man do you really need steroids for that
the answer is maybe but highly highly
unlikely
if you're six feet tall it's about 175
pounds and if you're six foot six first
of all you would swim in this shit
because bitches love a tall motherfucker
but all you got to do is weigh about 200
pounds
NBA players
200 pounds at six six that's actually
like a like a pretty stout NBA player
right do those guys have problems
pulling it in you aren't getting me how
many how many girls you ever seen like
yeah like an NBA I had a maybe a black
tooth skinny
a lot of people think NBA guys are
muscular they wear the jerseys they got
the Nelson like oh my God he's so big
like no he's not and you're over here
killing yourself about it but the
reality is
our standard our community standard of
what we think a guy should be is kind of
infinite like if you see a guy who's
like five foot six and three forty lean
you're like yes calves are small though
but if you say you know 150 five six you
you're like what is that Harry Potter
impersonator get out of here but in
reality your boy Harry is pulling that
shit in you feel me ain't got no problem
we got a wand and shit bitch zap
in any case that those are the numbers
and you can you can be skeptical of them
please I encourage you to do so
give them some thought
Google some celebrities
Google models male models
that's a real job by the way I used to
be a male model for some time I don't
like to talk about it it was very
traumatic it's an exploitative industry
Google their heights and weights to the
extent that you can get verifiable
numbers you're going to be like oh shit
I'm already the most Jack male model
that's ever been it's a real thing folks
it's a real thing now here's the thing
for some people within five years of
drug free training these numbers will
actually not be attainable reasonably
maybe they're attainable in eight years
maybe 10 maybe never okay
and for those people
steroid use may have a net attractive
improving effect to the opposite sex
but before we get to being like yep
those guys should use steroids we have
to ask a more intelligent question which
is
if the goal is to get laid more or well
I'm sorry to presuppose uh we'll put
this more PG to get girls to like you
more so you can go on nice dates meet
nice young ladies that are career
oriented and have everything figured out
and even hold out your hand on a walk
through the park afterwards and my lady
and you walk off uh and it texts them
two days later like a respectful person
that's what you're into then
yes you could have a number of things
you could do like taking steroids
absolutely is a fine idea uh not really
but maybe uh but you could also do a
bunch of other things to improve your
attractiveness right that's the whole
goal here presupposed in this discussion
is like I want to take steroids that are
more attractive so that I can track more
more ladies right
everyone else okay so if you have a
physique that is already meeting these
standards or is above or just below
and you've gotten there drug free we've
only been training for two or three
years and you're damn near there do not
use steroids to attract women to become
more attractive to women because you can
do it without steroids and without all
the fucking awful side effects and let
me tell you there's a ton all right so
here's the thing
first
second
there are other ways to increase your
chances of
interacting with the opposite sex and
officially
we'll get to that in a sec but first
steroids are not something you just do
and then what happens is your body
becomes more muscular and then what
happens next is you wake up in a room
full of adult film stars most of them
female
some of those boys in the uh on the
videos then they look pretty cute I
wouldn't say no if you know what I mean
I'd say no but I'd be playful about it
in any case you you don't just like take
drugs you wake up in a group and origin
you're like oh I did it finally here's
what really happens
here are the downsides first downside
that came to mind it's real It's
relatively frequent erectile dysfunction
fucking serious
Nancy's finally like oh my God Rob asked
me out and later she's like you want to
come back to my place and Rob's like
yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah I want to do
that
just take me you're like uh
yeah
can we just like
Junior High this shit I got hands
fuck you Rob
I want a working member she'll say next
in my voice strange
Ed not fun not remotely fun not some
shit you want to get into it is a very
common side effect and I'm not giving
you the nih.gov bullshit we're like you
look up what a stero is doing like
they're gonna give you pimples on your
friends break up with you and you get
cancer the next day like Ah that's all
over exaggerated but the baby shit is
real as shit without putting too fine a
point on it you know what I'm saying
it's got the video guys it's getting a
little hot in here
not hot enough for me to get erection oh
moving on health shit if they're bad for
your health legitimately does not help
your game
mood shit holy crap
typically you would go to a club or a
bar to interact with people in a jovial
way like hey what's up oh my God Rhonda
from work hey
if you are
more gear or any gear versus being drug
free you're more likely to become
a bit more silent it's a bit more like
this
will you fucking stand at the bar and
you're like oh damn it I bet I could
fucking beat up every single bouncer
here
and then Karen from Earth's like hey
aren't you that guy Jen from work and
you're like yeah so what if I am and
she's like okay and she just fucks off
and you're like uh come back I'm I used
to be nice when I wasn't on gear
yes steroids can improve your confidence
but a lot of times it's confidence in a
not so nice way not Life of the Party
confidence more like approaching a 405
pound death of kind of confidence John
no you guys pick up girls not exactly
the the kind of vibe you want to create
in addition to that we'll go further
steroids make you more masculine in your
mood and even in your brain processes
which I suppose is the same thing but
you end up being less communicative less
empathic you're able to clue in on
people's emotions a bit worse and
um sort of give give and take with
people like uh you know if someone's
like oh I'm not having a bad day today
like if you're not on gear you're like
oh man that sucks like I really feel bad
if you're on lots of gear uh and they're
like I'm having a bad day you're like
yep
it's tough sometimes you're like okay I
know
you seem mean and focused and angry
that that's kind of what you're like so
not ideal next legalshit hey shit is
illegal right so if you're like fucking
I'm gonna buy steroids and get laid more
or you go online here like buy
steroids.com yeah it's a site from
Indonesia should be safe agents bust
down your door it's probably not gonna
happen but you might get things that
aren't steroids in any case because
they're illegal it's all a bunch of shit
you just probably don't want to do
it's a huge cost is what I'm trying to
say
another thing is the real life of taking
steroids is injecting sucks traveling
with your gear I don't even know how
that works
who's got time for that shit it's awful
it's not he said One does not simply oh
I take a pill and boom right rejecting
files and needles and swabs
yeah so like if you get a girlfriend
girlfriend you're gonna have to tell her
sooner or later
she's like hey so like this guy's like
on my Instagram he's super Juiced up
it's gross and you're like uh yeah yeah
fuck that guy she's like I would never
date a guy stare at user and you're like
I would also never date a guy who you
steroids just to agree with her but like
you're gonna hide your vials or some
shit it's all nonsense and lastly
steroids cost money which you could
spend on other things that would get you
laid at a higher Roi can I say late
again
men are terrible
question
what other levers
Casino Style
can you pull
to get more female attention to become
more attractive to the opposite sex to
potentially get more dates I'll say it's
very nice
that maybe have fewer downsides
than uh using anabolic androgenic
steroids and holy shit I've thought of
at least seven of them again this is all
entirely theoretical I have yet to speak
to my first woman hey Scott the video
guy you talk to a lot of girls is it uh
scary
you know it's like a roller coaster it's
like after you get over the first hump
it's just smooth sailor but what about
the flip roller coasters that the flip
as after the first hump
that's that one crazy night in Vegas you
don't tell anyone about you tell your
pastor five years later
and he walks out of the booth and throws
up and you're like holy shit I guess
confession has its limits
in any case here we go if you want to
increase female attraction
yourself is the node that is the
attractor there's a couple things you
can do that have diddly dick to do with
taking drugs and getting more jacked and
they're generally much more effective
here we go one
confidence
uh maybe the most maybe the thing
females are attracted to the most
certainly top two or three things
they're most attracted to
and it's a trainable skill
uh I have a shitload of it now I can
back and talk to anyone I don't give a
fuck clearly
but like when I was in high school early
college holy fuck shit I was introverted
like this do my fucking homework I did a
lot of homework I know all this fucking
science shit but I had hardly talked to
people but I realized that confidence is
really important actually had a girl I
liked to tell me that directly and I was
like noted and then for several years
later I was like this kind of mean
something
something you can work on it's something
that's like training you expose yourself
to
and one of the ways to increase your
confidence is actually Point number two
which is to practice your conversational
skills
like it's so funny right
the point of becoming more attractive is
so you get to talk to girls in a way
that's like hey just like for fun and
then maybe go somewhere but we do this
in the gym for 80 hours a week and this
and fucking get jacked and then you come
up to a girl and she's like oh my God
your doctor I love that and you're like
ah nothing to say your conversation
skills suck great conversation skills
can close a fucking deal up easy they're
super super powerful and mega mega mega
trainable you just get good at this
stuff there's tons of guidebooks and
stuff back in the old days people would
read shit like you know social dynamics
the game pick up artists that's all
conversation skills and confidence and
you get them both through intelligently
applying the principles and it's I was
gonna say exposing yourself that's not
exactly what I meant certainly a way to
do it land you in jail
um just getting in and getting the
volume of interactions I talk to you
know easy to start out with someone
super nice talk to Grandma be like hey
Grandma what's what's going on try to
hold a conversation and talk to grandpa
and then talk to you know like the lady
down the street that's always nice to
you and then at least three people
you're talking to that you're pretty
decent at and then talk to someone in a
grocery store just like talk to the
cashier for a second and then you're
good I can talk to people I've got some
things to say and you try to talk to the
girl at the gym you shit your pants
physically literally right there on the
gym floor everyone laughs at you they
point you go in the bathroom you cry a
lot it's all right go out there and talk
about how big of a shit you took in the
gym yeah I'm that guy that did that shit
see now we got confidence here's the
thing I'm not just blown blowing uh air
up your skirts here this shit works way
fucking better than getting Juiced out
of your mind it just does I wish it
wasn't the case you would be swimming in
the shit I'm jacked out of my fucking
mind here this stuff just straight up
more important and trainable which means
that if you're genetically an introvert
you could be like the cool kind of like
doesn't say a lot but always says kind
of the right shit type of person this is
world's your oyster you can be really
really good at this stuff
number three humor bitches love to laugh
at some shit and I have I got nothing
else going for me getting a little few
laughs I still think of Nick have never
spoken to an actual female but
hypothetically it could it could do
great humor's a big deal also trainable
also potentiated by confidence and by
conversational skills you're starting to
see there's a bit of a um kind of a
coalescence between all these things
that make you drum roll social
which is the whole interaction of trying
to get laid is social just might as well
actually train the thing you are going
at like some people will be like hey I
want to get as Jack just possible you
know sweet what are you doing they're
like push-ups and sit-ups like I got you
you're doing like a push-up and sit-up
contest later like nope why don't you
like lift weights and do cables machines
and things that actually make you
optimally jacked like I don't know fuck
that all right so it's just as stupid to
just be in the gym training for girls
whereas most of the thing involved after
they let you into the conversation is
conversation shit which you should be
working on if you really really thought
this through
number four these are mostly like uh
statistical elements of what actually
determines attractiveness but there are
ways to leverage yourself in into uh
improving your chances here so one is
something called local status
um females generally in a group pay
attention to who the alpha is but it's
not necessarily Alpha and like that
where's the Ed Hardy shit you know and
has like one of those God the video guy
probably has that right now one of the
Beards cut off like this a little trim
beard brothers that's not necessarily
Alpha it's like if you're the top
trainer at your gym for example like and
and people know you're just a really
good personal trainer another personal
trainer girls the other girls are
training they're kind of keep an eye on
you they're like oh that's that guy
Kevin yeah I've heard people talk about
him and all of a sudden your status with
them goes up because in that local
little Zone you're kind of the fucking
you're kind of the Big Man on campus
right and that's definitely a thing and
it's a matter of not being Alpha like
okay nerd and pushing people soft drinks
out of the way it's a a matter of just
generally competency like you're you're
kind of the best or one of the best it's
someone thing and some little area I'll
tell you this if you're the best guy at
math in your college math class fuck I
said the wrongest thing ever since like
one half of a girl at the average math
class let me back up
psychology the hell now we're in the
money if you're the best person in your
psychology class at Psychology class
there are going to be a few girls that
are going to be like way more interested
than you than you had expected because
you're the fucking man you're that guy
in a very small scale and it's often not
that hard to do just by working on
something and becoming really good at it
in addition to that there's Global
status which are ways of representing
status that apply uh not just here not
just there but kind of more around the
board even around the world so things
like a high income job
right bitch sees a tax return she gonna
end up at your house cool Wick please
don't show random people your tax
returns but you know what I'm saying if
you're pulling in that paper holy shit
you could look like fuck all you know
that's not the classic that's my like
that's my goal in life is because short
shriveled up Jewish man with a gazillion
dollars by 18 supermodels around me I'll
just start hiring supermodelists my
butlers
my wife will approve and then you you
fucking made it but there's tons of
people like that in real life you're
like who the fuck is that asshole that
award sure ain't shit be like it's the
guy that owns half the Hollywood oh oh
and girls actually think that's
attractive Money Talks it's a thing it's
definitely a thing and you have a choice
in how much money you make you can
become profoundly good at something and
offer your services in the marketplace
and just end up fucking making way more
money than you were now which increases
your value perceived value to the
opposite sex
um in addition demonstrators of
previously High income like lots of
what's called stable wealth you get your
get your house get you a car like you
know there's a very different
conversation where you're in a bar let's
say in like New York and uh you know
you're just talking to girl and she's
like so like where are you like where
are you from like do you live around
here like very different conversation
like yeah remember the couple buddies
here a couple streets down it's cheap
but it fucking works and the roaches are
actually my friends versus you being
like well actually I like um I don't
think I've kind of like a I have a piece
of land and in Westchester and yeah it's
a bit of a commute but I Love This Bar
you know bitches like got dollar signs
for eyes at this point like holy shit
what the fuck bit of land
do you have Butlers do you have a
Lamborghini oh you're not Dr Mike get
out of here in any case industry Awards
I know crazy like if you're the best
neuroscientist in a given year at some
awards thing you go to the banquet later
people look at you different you're
fucking rank one that's important
military stuff huge you grad you you
finish out you you know your time in the
Navy and you get your dress blues or
whatever
that's a real thing man in uniform I'll
take me a piece of that and of course of
course Fame
if you're famous famous not me stupid
internet not for real famous Scott the
video guy famous for example uh wait no
that's Infamous uh you know like if
you're uh
Scott with a a leading male today that
we consider famous I'm so out of touch
Thor guy
Helms
worth
the heck is his first name
what about Chris Evans Chris Evans
Captain America I mean like if you see
Chris Evans comes up to the average girl
in a coffee shop and she's seen any
Marvel movie and he's like hey how are
you I just kind of noticed that um I
just didn't want to be rude she's
instantly going to urinate herself and
be like just just take just take me away
just fucking take me away I want to be
your wife
maybe that's too much attractiveness
anyway celebrity's a thing you can
really aim to be a celebrity that's not
likely it's not really like a planned
goal but you sure shit can do a great
job at your work accumulate a lot of
stable wealth and then realize that shit
yes taking steroids is significantly
easier but accumulating wealth and
getting a great job have zero downsides
on the net balance it's just all amazing
taking steroids is like plus is a
minuses at the very best next this is
gonna be the lamest thing I ever say it
just happens to be true fashion and like
how you do your hair
pull a decent amount with women
sometimes out ranking even physique I'll
put this in a very very fine point
fraction of women that can resist a man
in a well-fitted suit is zero this may
be not something you knew this is
something I didn't know until relatively
late in my game so to speak
he's like what does an attractive girl
wear to really get attention I mean like
that's kind of gonna know like short
skirt and fucking the boots to go up to
whatever fuck them you know what I'm
saying yeah duh
holy stuff
what does a man wear to attract a woman
the most most men will be like
basketball wrong posing trunks wrong
well-fitted suit a well-fitted business
suit for some damn reason probably to do
the status and wealth
just it affects women differently
who's that guy I know I don't know just
someone important I want him I want him
I have to have in any case
that's some shit you can get into why am
I saying this because like you might
have 140 pound physique at five foot six
or ten pounds away and you've been
training for eight years it's just not
on the genetic lottery for you to be 150
pounds of five six which is ideal male
jacked right and you think fuck fuck
fuck like I had to take steroids now uh
hold on a sec what about just like
getting you some well-fitted clothes
getting your hair done and your beard
done right and shit like that it's some
shit I've never done and never fucking
will do is totally outside of my fucking
area of shit I do but it works man it
works if you're really serious about
getting laid more that's the shit
that'll work way better than juicing to
the gills
lastly
on this note of things you could do
better that would get you more female
attention than using steroids is what I
call targeting your best Roi archetype
okay yeah ideally we're all fucking Thor
from The Avengers and we're just like
physically walk on fields of vaginas all
the time
yes great but
there are so many ways to present
whatever it is that you have in your own
way that's optimized for attraction
especially to Target a specific
sub-population of females that you may
be interested in that you don't have to
completely change yourself to optimize
your attraction for attractiveness
rather so for example like there's a
shitload of hipster girls which some of
them are fine I see I've seen a hipster
bitch in a coffee shop you're like what
up you know what I'm saying I'm not into
that hipster shit but hello the problem
is that won't work because usually in
hipster guys but if you're a hipster guy
and you got the whole beard oil shit
going on and you're not in the greatest
shape but you can talk hipster bullshit
you wear all the right clothes those
girls are into you like way more likely
and if you just optimize that version of
yourself you're going to be swimming in
that hipster-ish you don't have to go
out and get like six foot seven blonde
Scandinavian model girl cause like that
she's great but there's tons of other
great stuff going on that just fitted to
your Architect no you're not a
professional basketball player or a
fucking billionaire CEO it may
realistically be out of the very
unlikely for you to attract you know
kind of like you know Elite blonde model
or some shit but there's a lot of fine
ass women out there that are into some
different shit and they may be into some
of the shit you got going on because
there's all shapes and all walks in all
sizes that fit squarely into very
attractive and you're not trying to
attract the whole world
just a small fraction and then voila
right there is a type of girl out there
that very likely already likes what you
have going on you take what you have
going on get a bit more confident a bit
better conversational skills
a couple of canned jokes I'm kidding a
better sense of humor get you some
status through doing a good job
accumulate some wealth put on a
well-fitted suit holy shit well maybe
the Hipster girls might not like to see
whatever well fitted Scott what a
hipster guys wear that like uh for the
record hipsters Namaste I love you guys
but I'm a rat
when you have a flannel shirt that's
five sizes too small for your body
and the top button is buttoned up to
here so I think you're choking to death
and you have them skinny jeans on Scott
you know what I'm saying yeah
pointy boots would you leave the wicked
witch some shit them boots for but any
case you put some of that shit on you
while you're doing your best life you
got that confidence that's it hipster
girls is this a whole talk about how to
pick up hipster Girls by accident what
have I created
in any case all right here's the thing
what have we established and what is the
grand conclusion first
most guys most guys probably you can get
to Peak General attractiveness physique
for themselves
naturally within five years of training
and a serious attempted dieting is just
a thing again Brad Pitt and Fight Club
not an impressive physique
just Hollywood shit but that really is
the physique most girls are like Ah
that's great be like don't you want to
be a bit more muscular no not at all God
damn that's a low bar oh fuck here's a
guy that girls think is super hot
Tom Hiddleston uh Loki from The Avengers
is like uh super fucking attractive
that's like a fucking rail do you think
I can take steroids and lifts are you
kidding why right so put that into
perspective
second for those folks that can't get up
to that muscularity or leanness for
genetic reasons within you know
naturally within five or whatever number
of years they've tried
the return on investment on non-steroid
levers of Attraction things you could do
like improving your humor confidence
income Etc are just way higher than for
steroids
and uh in the reality Point number three
is most guys that use gear just really
aren't doing it for girls uh they're
just off on their own shit somewhere and
turning into a comic book while everyone
has a normal life and family and loving
friends and you're just gonna fucking
him doing this and you seem to think
that's great so it's kind of a big
illusion that like oh yeah you want to
be attractive use drugs like that's not
how that works and that bodybuilder guy
that is uh you know that Fitness chick
keeps talking to it turns out that uh
you know he doesn't even want her
attention because he's so Trend out of
his mind he just wants to work out and
she's like what are you doing later he's
like the vote away from me I'm curling
later you're like oh did he do that to
get her like no no no she's just weird
and into guys that are super jacked and
um
trying to understand this is really
tough because most of us think like
especially watching this channel I mean
I think if you're more jacked better
things happen to you in real life it's
just better to be more jacked but it
turns out getting more Jack just gets
you more jacked and not predictably a
whole lot else of them strength from
cross-sectional area stuff like that but
um guys comparing who's more jacked
is kind of like girls comparing brand
names of clothes
like he may walk in let's say with a
girl that you're friends with to a gym
and you're pretty jacked and there's a
guy way more Jack Jack whoa look at that
guy and she's like what do you mean you
look at him I'd love to look like that
she's like ah that ain't me and you're
like what but in a similar way girls
like will judge other girls for wearing
some kind of off-brand like um those are
not real Gucci pants girl and I'm like
what the fuck is Gucci it's just some
shit my Butler's buy with their
Lamborghini salaries I don't even know
what it is but most guys couldn't give a
flying fuck could you imagine you see a
fine ass girl at the gym fuck the gym
you see a fine ass girl at the barn like
God damn and you you know a girlfriend
friend that's a girl that you're with
it's like oh my God she's really wearing
that brand you're like what are you what
the fuck gives a shit she's like are you
like Ugh she's gross y'all because she's
wearing like cheap stuff like fucking
that hair who the fucking read a brand
for me who gives a shit
same idea
guys are into Jack guys girls are into
brands
goes that way so if you want to go this
way you got to meet somewhere in the
middle and luckily it just doesn't take
a Herculean physique to be able to do
and you can probably get there without
drugs at all so if you're thinking of
using steroids and other performance
enhancy substances to get more girls
think again yeah just kidding 1980s drug
propaganda out of the way seriously
think about it again and uh there's a
really good chance that you don't have
to do anything like that and there's way
better stuff you could be doing so that
you don't end up like me
I first forgotten
I don't think anyone's ever talked to me
certainly not a girl
that's luck out there fellas see in the
