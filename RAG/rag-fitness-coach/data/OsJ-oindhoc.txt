hey folks
welcome back to rp plus rpu
rp everything dr michael jotel here for
hypertrophy concepts and tools
advanced implications of sfr
lecture number 13. let's take a look at
what's on the agenda the content slide
is really big you can read it in your
own time if you want to pause the video
but basically what we're going to do is
a look at how the stimulus to fatigue
ratio which we've already defined in our
earlier video and really really explored
how to calculate it
and what it means we're going to find
out this time
how it intersects and interplays with a
bunch of other programming variables
like for example reps in reserve you
could ask a question
how many reps in reserve per set leads
to the best stimulus to fatigue ratio
that's a question we can ask and today
we'll answer it
what about exercise technique how does
it relate to sfr what about exercise
selection
we've already talked about some of these
some we have never talked about for
example frequency
per session volume all of these have
answers as to which ones
give you the best stimulus to fatigue
ratios not so great ones and the worst
ones to avoid
let's dig in and really explore this
super super advanced
intricate concept so first one
is the relationship of the stimulus to
fatigue ratio to reps and reserves so
essentially
what's the best stimulus to fatigue
ratio we can get
if we're asking the question of how
close to failure should we go
all right and it turns out that probably
a good guess is about two reps in
reserve
on average gives you the best stimulus
to fatigue ratios the best sfrs
why well anything much easier than that
the magnitude of the fatigue probably
isn't amazing isn't great you know it
wasn't uh very high so no worries
but the magnitude of the stimulus is so
low that the stimulus to fatigue
shows up not being so great right on the
other hand
you get the best stimulus possible
more close to it if you go to failure
and even a bit beyond failure
probably causes even more stimulus per
set so you could ask the question of
uh well gee you know if the stimulus
just goes up the cholesterol failure we
get it even beyond
why isn't sfr that great
at failure and beyond well the answer is
the fatigue goes up too
and unfortunately fatigue goes up faster
than the stimulus goes up so while
an rar2 set is pretty stimulative and
not so fatiguing an r0 set is
more stimulative by a small margin but
much more fatiguing
so that it turns out that the stimulus
to fatigue ratio
is not that great when we're pushing at
failure or beyond
but since this is an advanced lecture
let's get into the nuances
so time for the super intricate
discussion because
2r is a cool average but we can do
better than that
so it turns out at the beginning of a
mesocycle
when you're very primed for growth the
sensitivity of your muscles to a
stimulus is very very high
which means we can get an absolutely
high level of muscle growth stimulus
with much less relative effort proximity
to failure
than we would have to normally in the
middle of a mesocycle let's say
so at the beginning of a metacycle you
train just a little bit and thus get
just a little bit fatigue but you get an
impressive amount of stimulus
later on you have to train harder and
harder and harder to actually get less
and less and less stimulus even though
you
you keep trying to uh get as much as you
can and thus the fatigue cost
starts to go up so it turns out that the
beginning of the metacycle
the best sfrs might actually be uh
found at rirs of three and maybe even
four so the beginning of met cycle the
best stimulus to fatigue ratio might
actually be found
with three or four r which is maybe one
of the reasons why we say it's a good
idea to start them
right on the other hand
we have to note something that we say
okay
if the sfr is the best at three or four
and begin why don't we just keep doing
those types of rirs and just
finish the metacycle at three or four
rir sets just
you know do multiple many many sets to
make up for
well the problem is is that we have a
rising level of anabolic resistance
throughout the entire mesocycle
you great you get very easy growth in
the first microcycle in the second
microcycle you have to do a bit more and
train a bit harder to get the same level
of growth and so on and so forth
and notice even if you manage to get the
same level of growth
every single microcycle of a meso which
we can probably get pretty close to
doing
what is the fatigue doing at that point
well as the mesocycle
as the accumulation phase moves on just
cumulative fatigue rises every single
time
and forget about cumulative fatigue at
any one point if we're getting closer to
failure
right because we have to continue to
present a challenge and we have to
increase the load so on and so forth
if we get closer to failure whether it's
by just chasing overload or
by trying to outrun cumulative fatigue
we're going to end up
summing greater and greater and greater
acute fatigues to that cumulative so
not only is cumulative going like this
but acute fatigue adds to it every time
so it goes like that
which means remember sfr is stimulus
divided by fatigue if the stimulus is
basically the same but the fatigue is
like that
then sfrs decay every single microcycle
your best stimulus to fatigue ratio is
almost always found in your first
microcycle
of an accumulation not on the second
certainly not in the fourth or fifth or
sixth that's when it's
really really really bad so
a huge huge point is that
absolute on an absolute level of if you
just calculate the raw number of sfr
stimulus to fatigue relationship
the absolute level of sfrs falls from
microcycle one all the way until you
have to deload usually you see load when
the sfr has
fallen so much that it's almost not even
productive to keep training
right so that's definitely a thing that
absolutely happens
however we can say okay that's a fact
and we can go back and recognize okay
anabolic resistance is increasing every
single micro cycle
which means that if we continue to train
at three or four rir every single micro
cycle
at some point the anabolic resistance is
so high
our driver of stimulus at being three or
four rar
is just not high enough to cause maybe
almost any growth or starts to cause
very little growth
mind you we've got cumulative fatigue
going it's
taking the new the denominator of sfr
and jacking it up the entire time but
our numerator is falling
unless we push it harder so while sfr in
an absolute level
goes down throughout the accumulation
phase if we have to zoom in on any
single micro cycle and ask
what is the optimal rar to get the sfr
as high as it could be
relative to all other rars we could have
done in this let's say
microcycle three the answer is the rar
needs to get higher to get us the best
relative
sfrs the entire time it's a big big
brainy idea
but the conclusion of that is this your
best sfrs
at an absolute level are always going to
occur in the first or second microcycle
of amazon for sure
and they fall later and then you dealer
but
in any given microcycle as the
microcycles get
through accumulation the best sfr
generated in any single microcycle is
going to be
of a decreasing rir which means three or
four reps in reserve was the best sfr
you could have done in micro one and
also absolutely the best
in micro two it might be like two or
three rir because anything lower
the raw stimulus magnitude is so small
that the rising fatigue gives you a not
so great sfr
so essentially as we go from micro to
micro to micro
we should probably decrease our rirs
which is to say go closer and closer and
closer to failure
until the last micro cycle getting like
one rep away or at failure gives you
your best sfrs
for that microcycle versus any other
sfrs or that you could have done with
other rir so if you're like ooh
last micro cycle let's do an rr3 nope
awful sfr rar3 only gets you the best
sfrs if it's done in the first
or second microcycle not in the last one
of an accumulation phase
and you could say well crap so we have
to go closer to failure as we push
but the absolute level of sfr still
falls absolutely
and if you say well hold on a second why
don't we just go to failure in the first
micro cycle
well then your sfr is going to be not as
great as it could be
because you're going way too close to
failure right so we say well
hold on why is that a problem because
the fatigue is too high it's not the
stimulus magnitude that's the problem
right if you do a microcycle one and you
do a really really
you know rr0 all the way to failure your
stimulus magnitude's great it's just
your fatigue is too high not by a lot
but just by a little bit so if you do
three or four r it's better
but three or four ir is kind of like
sitting here as far as raw stimulus
magnitude
and zero rar might be sitting here and
if you can think of fatigue or anabolic
resistance
that occurs every single microcycle that
builds it's kind of like a
rising uh like tide pool of water that
makes a minimum level for when something
is tenable or not are really worth it
so if you you know you're up here with
one rir or zero rar and here's three or
four ir
right here it's good when the tidewaters
of fatigue aren't over it but at some
point at like
two or three micro cycles in the
tidewater start to go over
right and then this three or four reps
in reserve
starts to have a really crappy sfr
because it's just not enough stimulus
to overcome anabolic resistance and now
you're growing this much muscle
and getting not a crazy amount of
fatigue but a good sizable portion
if you're getting really close to
failure the only thing that ends up
saving you
is the fact that your fraction of muscle
grown is much bigger yeah you have more
fatigue
but the fraction of this versus this is
still better than
this tiny thing versus that even though
it's lower fatigue absolute
so let's turn around a little bit it's
it's a pretty detailed concept
right and we can expand it one more so
not only
through a mesocycle do sfrs on an
absolute level fall
okay but this is probably the case as
well for a career
so the best stimulus to fatigue ratio to
use on beginners on
average in a mesocycle is like three or
four which means beginners can start at
ri are like five or six like remotely
not even close to failure they get great
gains
demonstrated in a bunch of studies and
you don't have to go super hard and if
you do
you're actually paying a little bit too
much fatigue cost for the stimulus
you're getting which is better
but just not worth the fatigue cost as
you go from beginner to intermediate to
advanced
the rer optimality starts to probably
change for sfr
so that your best stimulus to fatigue
ratio when you were beginner might have
been oh three or four on average on
average
when you're intermediate it might be
around two which is why we use that
figure
when you're advanced this is not for
sure but based on all the theory you've
been talking about it's
speculative but likely that an advanced
individual
oh seven to ten years training plus
typical ifbb pro
zero or one rir might actually be
their best sfrs what
that means they might start a microcycle
with just one or two reps in the tank
and then in the middle
oh sorry start a mesocycle with one or
two reps in the tank in the middle of
the accumulation phase they might be
one rep in the tank or failure and then
they might do one or two weeks after
probably just one of going beyond
failure and doing uh
you know intensity techniques like you
know someone helping you up with a
concentric and then you do the centric
by yourself force reps so on and so
forth
crazy idea but for them their anabolic
resistance is
so high that nothing but the most
absolutely high raw stimulus magnitudes
might overcome that in other words in
super plain language if you're a pro
or if you're an advanced lifter you
might have to train so
hard you just have to pay the fatigue
cost for it because anything lighter
you're like man i wish my fatigue was
way lower
if i trained not as hard sweet but for
you now training not as hard maybe gets
you no growth at all
so you know if we have a stimulus of
zero it doesn't matter what the
denominator is
you're doing real bad on your sfr right
anything else would have been better any
tiny number would have been better than
zero
so as you go from the beginning of your
mesocycle to the end
your sfrs drop nothing you can do about
that
but you can help it a little bit by
increasing
sorry decreasing your rars going closer
and closer and closer to failure
roughly starting at three and ending at
zero if you're a beginner
you might even start at five or six and
go all the way to two or three reps in
reserve
great if you're intermediate you might
start at three or four and go all the
way to zero
totally fine if you're advanced you
might start at one or two and go all the
way
to beyond failure right and notice
the other big implication you get your
best sfrs
when you're a beginner right and you get
decent sfrs when you're intermediate you
get dog shit sfrs when you're advanced
and somebody can be like oh
that sucks well it's just reality and
it's the fundamentally muscle growth is
constrained by a variety of
physiological processes it just gets
harder to do
you know people will say like oh man you
know what's his name on the pro stage
looked great if he adds another five
pounds of muscle next year he'll come
back and just win the olympia look
adding five pounds of muscle at that is
you have to move heaven and earth
whereas for beginner adding five muscle
five pounds of muscles like i'm gonna
show up to the gym
twice a week you know for the next six
months and i'll have 10 pounds of muscle
right so and we'll come back to this
later at the end of this lecture
a really really big point that yes your
sfrs will fall over the career but you
can do things like everything in this
lecture
to keep them higher than they could have
fallen if you weren't worried about this
kind of stuff
all right sfr and exercise selection
some of this is review but basically
point number one here is
you gotta know which exercises for you
lead to the best sfrs uh on average and
do them more often
right so first you gotta rank them like
if someone says hey what is your best
sfr do you get more out of leg
extensions hack squats or leg presses
and you're like
i have no idea well then how are you
supposed to be choosing the best
exercises right
i'm sure you guys have done like maybe
you're traveling and used a different
kind of uh
bench press machine or some chest press
machine and you're like i swear to god
the only thing this machine does is it
wrenches my shoulders and elbows and i
don't get a pump and i hate it
who the fuck designed this thing right
bad sfr but then you might travel and
see some other machines and maybe you
have them at your gym maybe you don't
where it's the perfect track
unbelievable pump oh my god this is like
a direct connection to my chest and my
shoulders and elbows feel
great right that's awesome so if you
have a ranked
list of lifts which do better for you
then worse you're way ahead of the game
and then you use mostly mostly the ones
that rank the highest
but here's the deal some somebody could
ask the question of like well so we have
a ranked list of like let's say one to
five best sfr exercises for each muscle
group
why don't we just use the number one
right why do we have to use number two
and three well
first of all first of all because we
need variation because variation is
beneficial just doing one of anything is
a bad idea for a variety of
reasons uh principle variation uh is is
uh important and we can't just say we'll
just do the best exercise forever but
there's something a little bit more
intricate here that is very interesting
if you overuse the same exercise it
starts to go stale
the staleness itself decreases its sfr
until it's not as good of sfr as the
exercise it used to be better than
so your ideal exercises will change you
don't want to get to that point with
exercises where you have to change them
because they're so stale they suck
any sooner than you have to so check
what you can do
is in your program at any one time
whether it's per week from as a cycle
per macro cycle
have a couple exercises in there for the
same muscle group
the top four sfr exercises not just the
top one
so a quick example on how staleness can
drop sfr well
we have the the three and three three
raw stimulus magnitude factors
and the three fatigue factors and we can
just compare them uh
how they rank on uh you know on sfr and
see how stainless affects every single
one of those so
mind muscle connection okay almost the
definition of staleness and the regular
arsenal of thinking about lifting
is an exercise feel still because i
cannot get as good of a mind muscle
connection i ever do curls
like you've done dumbbell curls for like
six months and you do them you're like i
don't really know what these are doing
anymore
i don't even know if i'm using my biceps
or what the hell's going on i hate it
right so staleness by overusing the best
sfr exercise
drops the mind muscle connection which
of course lowers the raw stimulus
magnitude
even fatigue is identical lowering the
raw stimulus magnitude decreases so far
and now maybe easy curls had this sfr
and regular barbell curls had this one
but now after the mind muscle connection
has been reduced maybe we're here still
worth it though so let's keep going what
about the pump
okay stale exercises give you less of a
pump require more sets to get the same
pump they used to
down shrinks are sfr once again what
about muscle disruption the ability to
really really disrupt the target muscle
right well if an exercise is stale what
ends up happening is you do like eight
sets of it it used to be like you did
six sets
and afterwards your biceps were like oh
my god like somebody's wrong with me you
used to try to brush your teeth and
you're like i'm having a muscle spasm i
can't do this right
good indicator that you cause some
growth if your muscles are fairly well
disrupted and maybe even they get sore
but how sore do you get after using
exercise for six months
even how much disruption do you feel in
it like you do it eight sets of curls
and you're like
and someone's like what do you hear your
biceps like all fucked up right you're
like i don't know my elbows hurt
my biceps feel fine not a good sign down
shrinks your raw stimulus magnitude and
of course of course
goes down your sfr and now we might even
have a tie
right where barbell curl straight black
cars normally aren't our highest sfr
but we've brought this sfr of easy curls
basically to a tie so now we could sort
of use both
this is when you show up to the gym when
your training partner's like hey do you
want to trade out exercises
you're like yeah i feel still feel easy
curls are like least as good as anything
else they're not like stale stale but
like
maybe a couple weeks we'll see right
another metacycle
we haven't even gotten to the fatigue
stuff yet what does stainless do to
fatigue
joint and connective tissue disruption
oh my god almost another definition of
stale exercise is once it really starts
to bother your joints
yeah hack squat was great but now your
knees hurt every time you do hack squats
and like you don't really feel that leg
press on your jim's corner but you're
like man
i'm starting to feel like i want to do
that leg presses at least my knees won't
hurt
right all of a sudden
whatever exercises we've been doing that
had our best sfr
might be less now and now that leg press
or that barbell curl
that you didn't want to do because at a
lower sfr now it has the absolutely
higher sfr
oh that's pretty cool right but it might
only like you know
as soon as you start using it it starts
to go stale itself and then you know
this
gets not stale so you'll be like you
know let's alternate week after week
after week of these two exercises
because they're about equivalent
uh maybe you don't want to do that
because that violates uh
some specificity concerns so let's see
what the other fatigue factors do rpe
how much something essentially
psychologically beats you up how much
effort it takes
right and that's the thing like uh
remember fatigue is also psychological
if you're doing an exercise especially
with you've built up to doing really
heavy loads on it
and uh you're really in tune with how
the exercise is supposed to be done
but it's also stale as shit you're gonna
feel like you're working really really
hard you're gonna be doing these cable
curls
oh my god like get me out of here i hate
this right it takes so much effort to do
these things
but if you do a new exercise because of
the novelty you don't have to use as
much load
and because it's psychologically
enjoyable because it's different your
rpe rating of perceived exertion is just
not that high
so all of a sudden you're taking less
psychological and neural fatigue from
the same exercise
so boom sfr shrinks one more time if
stimulus continues
right and of course unused muscle uh
strength fall off
how much an exercise affects another
muscle after it you know it might not
uh change a lot unless your rpe is so
high for this exercise now that's stale
that it drains the living shit out of
you and you have to
really pump up a lot of central drive to
do it and get through it
and then you go onto that so for example
let's say you're doing an exercise you
just
fucking hate because it beats up your
joints it takes a ton of effort to do
takes a ton of effort to do a pump etc
etc etc so for the same rust stimulus
magnet
you have to do a ton of work just
physically more
volume right how much does that affect
your strength in the next exercise
right as opposed to doing like three or
four sets of barbell curls and getting a
gnarly pump and then doing lateral
raises and be like this is great
you're not doing like eight sets of easy
curls you feel like shit and then
lateral raises you're like man i can't
even i'm tired i can't do these that
much
your strength falls off on that second
exercise in the unused muscle group so
essentially stainless and don't get this
twisted this is exactly what i mean when
i say it
affects every single part of your
stimulus to fatigue ratio
by dropping it so if you have three or
four or five
top sfr exercises don't worry that like
oh we gotta really do this one and fuck
all these they suck no
no no we wanna do this one for sure but
we want to keep a couple of these in the
rotation as well
during any particular let's say two of
them during a particular mesocycle or
several
and then once the sfr for these drops
the sfr for these is going to be higher
and we might do these two and give these
a break to re-establish the best sfrs
very very very straightforward all right
technique stimulus and fatigue ratios
affect
or rather exercise techniques effect on
the sfr first of all
really important question to ask every
time you want to know this is
what is the target muscle with this
exercise right because it's really hard
to gauge sfrs even
not even by calculation just in your own
head somebody could ask you like hey
like
are you doing like a close grip bench
and someone's like how does that uh hit
your muscles and you're like super well
and they're like yeah like your chest
and you're like oh i thought you meant
triceps like that's why i'm doing this
right it's okay to have a muscle an
exercise hit multiple muscle groups
um it's totally fine i would say that if
you're
really serious about hypertrophy
training and especially if you're
listening to this lecture and plan on
implementing a lot of this stuff
every exercise should have a one
priority muscle group which you really
think about
during the time the mind muscle
connection and the technique is designed
to hit
that muscle and if other muscles are
also hit great so for example
you could do close grip bench in your
case you might use it for triceps
and when you use it for triceps when
you're lowering it you're like triceps
triceps triceps triceps keep my elbows
tucked in
triceps lock out powerfully right yes
your pecs will be contracting
they will be getting a hypertrophy
stimulus yes you have to integrate your
pecs
work on that into your total weekly
volume landmarks for sure
but how you calculate sfr because you
are purposefully doing triceps like you
say okay close grip bench is for triceps
that's why i'm doing it today because
i'm training triceps
then it'll help you make sure that you
get the most out of exercise for the
triceps
okay so super important to pick probably
one muscle group
and then let the others collect what
they will right and then once you have
whatever exercise you're focusing on for
that you know number of sets
you can slowly experiment with technique
to try to improve the stimulus to
fatigue ratio
and it's really quite simple especially
with mind muscle connection that's your
first start
but not the only one right whichever
exercise lets you feel the tension
throughput at high weights a ton or at
low weights
feel the crazy burn exactly in the
muscle you want
whatever technique gets you there that's
probably a pretty good technique
like imagine someone saying hey man i
want you on the leg press to go out real
wide
and then just do these half reps with a
ton of weight and let me know when you
feel your quads you do a whole set
you're like i never found my fucking
quads i never felt any tension through
my quads i felt it through my adductors
my glutes
and i never got any lactate or anything
like that no burn
like that sucks but you take your leg
press and you put it uh you know legs
together and low on the platform all of
a sudden you're doing you're like oh my
god my quads are first of all gonna
break off of my legs
at heavy weights and then at lighter
weights i feel like there's some kind of
like something frying literally inside
my quads
right help help help that's a great
thing so mind muscle connection is your
biggest tool
to get to altering technique it's like a
sensor for you it's a guide
right you don't know where your best
technique is but you could sort of be
like where's the best mind muscle
connection you experiment a little bit
and when you find that
that's probably going to be a good thing
but there's other ways to check too
what gives you the best pumps right
we talked about the the burns thing what
gives you the best pumps is really good
what seems to disrupt your muscles the
most after training so for example you
can try a technique on the chest fly
you walk out of the session and like
right after the session you're like i
don't know my chest's like
pump whatever but it feels more or less
the same i don't feel like it fried it
uh and then a couple hours later it
feels fine and a day later there's no
soreness
but if you find a technique on the chest
fly in which afterwards oh my god
there's something wrong with my pecs and
they're like sitting there and sometimes
they're like contracting myself like
holy shit i fucked something up which is
good right
to a point and then you get like a
little bit sore the next day and you're
like wow okay whatever like grip with or
whatever i changed
seems to be hitting me more and of
course the fatigue stuff
joint and connective tissue soreness how
rpe like you could find
a way to use the bench machine which is
not even that hard
but you get a gnarly chest pump awesome
versus like you have to grind like shit
and then your chest doesn't do anything
so sfr same stuff i'm not going to
review what the multiple components is
the highest gross stimulus magnitude you
have and the lowest fatigue magnitude
you could have
all the little techniques make a small
bit of difference now here's the deal
if you're fundamentally doing good
biomechanics in the exercise like full
range of motion hitting the target
muscle generally
don't go crazy and be like i gotta
change my technique every day
to get the best sfr just be aware of
shit that's obvious
and you can obviously change to do
better and try to keep the changes
around to see
if it consistently gives you good
results because one day it could feel
good one day not it's not much to
conclude so i would do it a couple of
micro cycles
probably a mesocycle or two in a row of
a specific kind of technique
see if it compares well to another so
for example stuff you can do
body setup like uh arch or or not on an
incline like on an incline bench you
could take a really big arch or not see
which one is better for your upper pecs
that you're targeting
grip width right you know like is this a
medium grip bench or is this a medium
grip bench or is that a medium grip
bench or is this a medium and this is
close
well that's up to you and your body's
built differently than everyone you
could grip like this and get an awesome
chest pump and your elbows don't hurt
you could grip like this and you get a
shitty chest bump in your elbow shirt
like shit it's clear which one has the
best sfr right
and it's all about what's best for you
if someone can tell you hey try this and
if it doesn't work for you it sucks
i've actually trained with a few i could
be professional bodybuilders and ran
through with them through their
exercises and it was really fun and i
learned some cool stuff
but some of the exercises they were
doing this fucking sucks and it's not
that it sucks
they thought it was great because it was
great for them i didn't like it because
it didn't work for my body
right entire exercises or the specific
kind of techniques they were using
easy one as foot width how wide do you
squat how why do you put your leg press
why do you put your leg curl totally uh
super super individual which everyone
has the best of so far
toe angle right a lot of people when i
do all leg curls um
i point my toes out and a bunch of
people ask me like why do you do that
i'm like that's just where they go when
i feel my hamstrings the most
that's it there's no fucking magic i'll
point it this way send me membranosis
and all that shit
like that's way way way too specific if
you want to go on those tangents fine
just make sure you don't trade away
overload for me
i could overload better feel the muscles
better my knees and
everything else hurt less if my uh toes
naturally go out
you can experiment with a bunch of
different stuff yourself
how you end up putting yourself into
various positions is another big one
just an example
so for example for triceps if you're
doing skull crushers
you can sit back sort of sit your arms
back away from your triceps so when
you're starting the movement your elbows
your upper arm moves up and then you
break at the elbows or you can sit the
weight into your triceps by breaking
down this way and then going that way
same thing as with a squat if you sit
into the squat kind of forward into your
quads and then down
versus sitting back away from your quads
and sort of back
away and down from the quads the whole
time there's actually not a right or
wrong here
because if you sit too far forward into
your quads and your elbows you get
nasty elbow pain and knee pain if you're
doing for squats
on the other hand if you sit way back
away from your squat
you probably won't get any knee pain you
might get hit pain though because your
back starts to round or
you just don't feel your quads that much
so your fatigue could go down but your
stimulus goes down too
so it's a it's for you to find that best
ratio of k
if i sit into my quads a little bit it
fries them but it doesn't hurt my knees
so that's all up to you and here's the
thing as long as it's safe fundamentally
there's no right or wrong here right
very limited person-to-person transfer
which is why a lot of questions you can
see me on my instagram doing this and it
kind of looks like i'm a rude asshole
i'm trying not to be
people say like you know dr mike why do
you grab the bar like this or like that
or why do you do that with your feet
almost always it's like who gives a shit
right now it's it's
for sure everyone thinks that when
people do particular techniques it's for
a very very very good reason
and it can be but sometimes they're
personal a reason like this is just what
gives me the highest stimulus to fatigue
ratio
and then they ask well what should i do
you should start maybe where i start or
we're just some fundamental stuff it
feels good
and then play a little bit here and
there to see which one fits you
best right last point on this big point
glad i didn't forget to look at that
your techniques can change through your
career
especially if you get much bigger or
much leaner
right i used to have the best possible
sfr for my squat
by grabbing close just like this then my
fucking
biceps and forearms got so goddamn big i
have to hold the bar out here
because if i hold the bar here i
literally just get unbelievable elbow
pain and i'm like okay this is awful
right where you do your pull downs some
people
can't their lats and shoulders are so
big they can't touch
their chest with pull downs and you say
well that's wrong it's not wrong it's
the lowest they can possibly go
all kinds of different stuff will change
as you get bigger when you get
leaner you'll be able to squat deeper
and leg press deeper than you ever did
before
that might even mean you could move your
feet down and closer because you don't
have to make as much room for your gut
people say like why'd you change your
leg press technique
well i can do this now and it works
better if you tried to do that before
your
simply your hips would come up in your
lower back round right so essentially
don't get glued to one technique as like
okay
this is exactly how i squat and
everything else sucks
for a month or two for a block that'll
be totally true
but if you notice that one technique
just is not getting you the same sfrs as
it used to
play around with a little bit of other
stuff and a lot of times it's not really
like a mystery
like when it starts to hurt your elbows
to try to grip close together
what's the answer it's probably not grip
even closer right it's like okay let me
go wider and then wider than the wider
and eventually out super wide
another hilarious thing is is it better
to grip the bar like this or just put
your hands over the bar
well ideally it's better to grip it
because you get more stable
and some people say like like mike like
why do you put your hands out here in
the bar i would love to fucking break
the bar but i can't because elbows are
going to fucking kill me
so another interesting thing as you go
through your career the absolute sfrs go
down but relatively speaking at any one
time
you gotta pick the best technique for
them right and a lot of the pros that do
partial range of motion
if you look they're actually doing full
range for how big they are they just
can't fit anymore
all right sfr and set numbers
per exercise so if we're doing
leg press do we get better sfrs on
average if we do two sets of leg press
or like four sets of leg press or maybe
like six or maybe like eight
well generally speaking the highest sfrs
on average especially for beginners
intermediates
are going to be with the lowest set
numbers because
there's a certain amount of anabolic
stimulus to collect
right and it takes a certain amount of
effort to do so and you're very
sensitive
you have a certain amount to collect
total when you start training session
as you do one set you might collect like
30 or 40 percent of it set number two
collects
you know another 20 or something like
that so you're well halfway to it
all the other sets collect less and less
and less of it but all the other sets
are
approximately equivalently as hard
certainly pretty hard
and it ends up being that the raw
stimulus magnitude of the first set is
this
and the fatigue is that raw stimulus
magnitude the second set is going to be
lower
much lower but the fatigue is like a
little lower maybe but comparable
right so your sfrs don't degrade like
this
with more and more sets of the same
exercise but they kind of like sort of
hang in there and then they start to go
down
right so after a while we're gonna see a
decline now
you could say well doesn't that mean we
just need to do a few
different uh you know uh exercises like
sort of all the time
uh let's say instead of doing six sets
of leg press
we do two sets of leg extension two sets
of leg press two sets of squats same
number of total sets but we always
change the exercise well
there's downsides to that too so for
example there's a warm-up downside
uh especially for my muscle and
technique adjustment
you start to do leg presses your first
set's going to be great but you're like
you know what my feet were out too far
on that
you bring them in a little bit they're
going now that i have a pump i can
actually move my feet out a little bit
again
and i can lower my hips and every single
set you probably notice this in your own
training
if you do like four sets of something
every single set the mind muscle
connection feels a little bit better the
technique
fits a little bit better so our sfrs are
sort of mitigated they don't fall as
fast as we would think
if you change exercises altogether
you're now dealing with a bunch of the
fatigue very little anabolic stimulus
left to collect because a lot of that's
just specific to the muscle not the
exercise
but now you sort of have to re-warm up
like if you were instead of doing
four sets of leg presses you did two
sets of leg presses and then move down
to leg extensions
the first set of leg extension is going
to be good but it's going to kind of be
like oh that was a good set but i should
have had my feet a little wider
and then the second set's a little
better than the first in that sense and
it's sort of like this
little pains of adjustment right it's
almost like this
if i always make race car now just from
goddamn reason i don't even follow
motorsport but it just makes sense
if you got a guy who is in the lamont or
something 24-hour race
and he's got his car and he's racing his
car
and the car you know accumulates fatigue
right um
you say should he dump his current car
and switch to a new car
halfway through the race the argument
for yes is like the new car is not going
to be as worn down
bolts are uh tighter or so on and so
forth but the problem is he has to get
used to a new car
of course like he will he's a fucking
ball or race car driver he's probably
used that car before
but man in the middle of a race man that
you know you as a race goes on you start
timing your turns really well
exactly for the car you're driving you
switch your car the first couple of laps
maybe the first dozen laps are
awkward as fuck and it's just a cost you
don't have to pay
so switching exercises too soon to
pursue new ones does
not improve the sfr and might actually
degrade
right so sfr stays pretty stable for an
exercise for a while and switching
exercises won't help
but at some point the sfr goes down
probably to essentially like
an acute stainless where you do so many
sets of an exercise that it's not your
technique isn't better anymore
you just want to get off the fucking
thing if not for just psychological
reasons but also because you've
sort of rewormed the same joint
structure so many times you're like man
i don't really wanna
i can't incline bench any more than this
right or the particular fibers you have
sort of allotted now you've pretty much
maxed them out anabolic signaling wise
and it's time to switch gears a little
bit switch angles to get a new fresh
super group of fibers that haven't been
super stimulated so like
if you've been inclined pressing for a
while maybe it's time to do some flat
pressing to get the fibers you want or
if you like pressing for a while maybe
it's time to do some light extensions
and some squats to get some fibers that
you weren't focusing on right because
their stimulus allotment hasn't been
nearly filled yet
when does this happen we have no idea we
have some idea
educated guests from dr james hoffman
and myself including jared feather
probably like after about five or seven
sets of the same exercises if you think
about it from your own real world
training
you can probably remember that that's
probably pretty true like somebody could
say hey dude two sets of leg press
let's switch exercises i got a couple
more sets
after about four or five sets of leg
press if someone says let's switch
because you got to do let's say 10 sets
total that day anyway
you're probably pretty inclined to be
like yeah i feel like now squatting will
be a fresh take and the sfr will be
really good maybe the first set of
squats will be that great of sfr but
after that i'll really catch my groove
it'll be awesome so i'll do like four
and four
right but if someone was like hey you
got a leg press for eight sets
fuck after like set number six you may
be like man
i don't want to be here anymore you
start to avoid
the biggest concentrations of stimulus
and pump and the biggest uh
uh essentially you start to avoid the
mind muscle connection will get you the
most because you're already trying to
get away from the exercise and
you you know you your sfr might degrade
on the fatigue side because your knees
start to hurt a little bit there's only
so much like pressing you can do in the
same session
so essentially after about five to seven
sets probably need to change
but after two or three sets before two
or three sets there's probably no need
to change and it might even lower your
sfr
after five to seven probably need to
change and you can use this right away
in your programming
so if you know if you have an uh an
average number of sets you have to hit
per session
you can figure out how many exercises
you're going to use usually it's like
just one or two exercises what you don't
want to do is use three exercises for no
reason
or just one exercise for normies
all right now
not per exercise but per session per
muscle group can we have to train
chest what is the sfr
optimized at as far as number of sets
for
chest or for quads in one session well
for beginners and intermediates
especially for beginners
sfr is maximized with low set numbers
okay so your first set remember there's
that total amount of anabolic stimulus
to collect
your first set is tough but not really
fatigue-wise much tougher than the other
sets
it collects most of it already it is
essentially the low-hanging fruit
sort of uh kind of problem phenomenon
right this happens with almost
everything
like what's the easiest food to reach in
your fridge it's the food that's there
first
okay is there anything special about the
food in the back no it's just you have
to reach around stuff and until i eat
this food here that other food's tough
set wise it's just the same way you get
most of your growth
from the first set not that there's
anything magical about the first set
it's just that the most
easiest growth triggering pathways are
just here and they're like
that's it hit me up as soon as you hit
up those pathways you get more
resistance from hitting other pathways
and just how much effort you have to put
in to continue to stimulate muscle
growth just goes up
right so the best sfrs are usually at
the low set numbers
for set seconds and so on and so forth
right
now you could say aha aha
that means we have to do very few sets
per session and just do lots of sessions
but that's uh an interesting solution
that doesn't work
because we've uh have good literature
and very good theory
to suggest actually the literature shows
this that the more frequency you do
the lower your sfr is for any given
session okay
so there seems to be no way around this
you can have a relatively high volume
session of
dog shit sfr towards the end or you can
have three low volume sessions with the
first hund
great sfr the second one shittier and
the third one also shitty
and then all of a sudden your average
sfr there's a kind of a middle range
there where you can't really just
obviate this problem so yes
your frequency should be a good
frequency but as long as you're in a
general frequency range the per set
and per frequency all essentially
cancels out and you're left with roughly
the same sfrs right
and if you have to have a certain volume
whether it's you spread it in a bunch of
sessions or in one session you just have
to deal with sfr for example
let's say your minimum effective volume
for a particular session
is five sets like if you don't do five
sets of chest you won't grow four sets
doesn't grow your chest it's just
maintenance for you at this point right
you could say well you know my sfr would
be the best at four cents
no it won't because because zero growth
you get zero net growth your sfr is
fucking zero your sfr first starts to be
good at five sets
or even if you look at just hypersort of
very hypothetical
uh sfr of like if i could grow yeah then
of course you would grow more from the
first
set and the second set but that's just
not enough so if someone comes to the
gym and they're doing six sets of chests
you could be like a like a wise ass but
you know you get your best sfr so the
first two sets and they could be like
well i need six sets minimum to grow
what do you think about that you're like
word up fam i got nothing for you so
remember sfr
is the king of all muscle growth
measurements
but it's not the only one it's not the
only concern
fundamentally raw stimulus magnitude
trumps everything
because that's actual muscle growth
being stimulated yeah there's a fatigue
component
but sometimes you just have to get a
certain amount of raw stimulus magnitude
and if you're willing to pay
incrementally higher and higher fatigue
for it sometimes that just you just have
to
do it so people will say you know the
best bank for your buck is low volume
programs totally
but if you want a certain total raw
stimulus magnitude a certain total bang
you're just going to have to pay out a
certain number of bucks period
right it's like someone saying to you
you know
if you ship a package from philadelphia
to washington dc which is just not that
far away
you only pay 10 bucks you know per per
mile or i don't know like
10 cents per mile on the truck really
good that's pretty good
right and you say okay well if you send
a package
from philadelphia to kansas city you
have to pay
15 cents per mile not 10 cents per mile
it goes up you're like right right okay
so it's a worse deal like yeah
better bang for your buck to ship it to
washington dc okay and your response is
what if i have to ship a package to
fucking kansas city though like yeah
yeah
you just have to do that then that's it
right so yeah ideally
we do lower volume programs and people
say this all the time like you know
you'll see like uh teenage articles like
low volume programs are the best or low
low number of sets per session
sure but if you have to grow more than
that yeah you'll have to deal with dog
shit sfrs to get enough raw stimulus to
make a difference in your physique to go
where you want to go
right people also say like hey your
bodybuilder like eating six meals a day
is not mandatory for gains
for sure but it is mandatory to look as
good as you possibly can if that's what
you want
that's just what you have to do right so
sfr after the first set even if a new
beginner let's say
sfr would start to drop off definitely
but it doesn't drop off nearly as much
as we would think
because it's mitigated by some factors
so there's a warm-up component
right um essentially when you're not
warmed up
your fastest switch fibers don't even
activate so if you don't warm up super
great your first set
is like a very good set but a lot of
your really fast switch fibers didn't
even turn on towards the end
then when you do your second set you're
more warmed up and you get more faster
fiber recruitment and all of a sudden
hypertrophy is pretty similar and this
fatigue is pretty similar your sfr is
still kicking it it's still hanging in
there
even after the first set and the second
set right mind muscle connection we've
been through this before mind muscle
connection improves
every single set up to maybe like five
sets so that mitigates the drop in sfr
another sfr is not going like this after
sentence sentence set you might be going
like that just dropping a little bit
there's a higher effective reps fraction
right so if you do
15 reps on your first a set and you do
seven reps to failure on your second set
remember that those cause a very similar
amount of hypertrophy as far as set
descent
is concerned primarily because much not
most or not all much of the hypertrophy
is caused
by the you know the last three or four
very difficult reps the effect of reps
so to speak
well if you have a set of 15 reps and
only the last let's say five are very
effective
your next set because you're so tired
for whatever reason after you know
you're
you might have 10 reps but then your
fraction of effective reps here
is one third and the 15 your best set
but in your not so great set your
fraction effective reps
two reps that are not as great is one
half that's actually a better fraction
right that's one of the cool things
about behind the uh bergey fagarelli's
my reps training system
is that as you you know your first
working set is 20 reps or something but
then it's like five five five three
three three and then you quit
all of those mini sets are like very
hypertrophic for how many reps you're
getting
now it turns out they still accrue more
fatigue than stimulus compared to the
first set
but not nearly by as much as you would
think which means the sfr doesn't just
drop like that after the first set it
hangs in
pretty good region for a while and
another one is a local
systemic fatigue ratio we'll cover that
one in depth when we talk about
um different muscle group training
procession and how that happens
but essentially local fatigue is uh
accumulated with every single successive
set you do one one after another after
another systemic fatigue is just
accumulated over the course of any
session
as far as time is concerned so if you
say okay i can only do two sets of this
you get a certain level of local fatigue
and a certain level of systemic if you
increase the number of sets you're doing
here yeah you'll get more systemic
fatigue
but you'll get more local fatigue too
and your ratio of local fatigue to
systemic fatigue
starts to get a little bit better as you
pound the same muscle over and over with
multiple sets
and remember local fatigue does cause
hypertrophy to some extent
systemic fatigue doesn't but as that
ratio improves it keeps your sfr from
not
getting as bad okay so
all that taken together it means that
for
beginners our sfr starts at one set it's
the best
and then again maybe by like oh four
six sets it's pretty low for
intermediate person
we have another interesting problem here
right
so well we're going to cover it here ooh
we're going to save it for a little bit
we'll cover it now
we'll review it later too too juicy to
spill so
intermediate person they have a problem
which is yes the first set is
stimulative
but not stimulative enough to pass that
anabolic threshold that we have built
up so if you just do one set at a time
right and even with a really good
frequency
you might cause zero muscle growth
because it's not
beyond the minimum effect of volume and
for an advanced person you might have to
do two or three sets
as essentially almost in some technical
sense like warm-up sets
they're definitely contributing to
hypertrophy drive but no net hypertrophy
until you do like a fourth one
and that's the first thing that gets you
over the the spill
and gets you to where you need to go
right so what ends up happening here
is the sfr for beginners starts very
high and immediately drops off but not
super quick
the one for intermediate folks starts
actually a little lower
crests at two or three sets hangs in for
a while and then drops off at eight ish
or something like that
for an advanced person the sfr might
actually climb to where it's highest at
four or five sets
and then falls off after that we'll talk
about that a little bit but from an
absolute perspective let's say just for
the average intermediate
after about eight to twelve sets the sfr
no longer does the slow drop it starts
to drop
really really fast one reason is that
neural fatigue is always going up
neural drive goes down your nervous
system's ability to get as much
juice out of especially the faster
twitch fibers of the muscle that are the
most growth prone
starts to go really really poorly and
then your your idea of what a
working set is is it's just not working
all that great plain and simple so there
starts to be a big downside to that
um the collection of muscle growth from
each set starts to go down so basically
you're you'll get this much muscle
growth to stimulate total your first set
might do this your second set that
up up up to here you know when you're on
your eighth and twelfth set or whatever
you're like doing this
right you're getting real close to the
top and you might even go over the top
to where it's negative
right but you have these tiny little
fractions to collect but what's what's
the fatigue of each set it means the
fatigue of a working sense about the
same as it was for the first
as it is for an eighth so you're
bringing this much fatigue into your
eighth set
to collect this much hypertrophy your
sfr sucks
right another problem your mind muscle
connection starts to degrade after a
certain number of sets after 10 sets of
chests i don't even know what you're
training and you don't know what you're
training either
you do it flies and someone's like do
you feel your chest i honestly haven't
felt my chest in the last like three
sets we did
right so that degrades which is really
really bad a lot of that degrades due to
excitation contraction
deon coupling or decoupling it's
basically
you have the nerve tells the muscle to
contract when you have enough junk
you know the nerve is really tired and
you have enough junk in the uh
in the synapse there and then your
muscles are really poor at receiving
signals now because there's metabolites
everywhere and parts are broken
uh all of a sudden the nerve's not that
good at telling the muscle contract
anymore and you just don't get as much
stimulus right
so for most people in training
three to eight sets per session
especially for the intermediate uh
probably gets your best per week sfrs at
normal frequencies
so if you come in and you do only one or
two sets you might have actually had a
better sfr
taking the whole week into consideration
because we know that added frequency uh
creates problems for sfr
um three to eight sets per session
probably because oh you know if you're
doing one or two it's probably not that
great per session if you're doing
14 and 15 it's probably not that great
three to eight is probably have your
best sfr
that doesn't mean that you only do three
to eight you might have to do 10 sets
per session just to get enough
hypertrophy
or you might have to do more sessions
than it's optimal for sfr
just to get your ostingus management but
the closer you can get to it
the better next one
sfr and muscle group order within a
session we've already explained this a
little bit so
just to to finish it up here's the deal
hypothetical example is it better to do
four sets of chests than four sets of
back then four sets of chest then four
sets of back sixteen cents total and
exercise chest back chest back
is it better to do that letting the
chest and back rest every little while
for you know 10 minutes or whatever
while you're doing the other muscle
group or is it better to make adjacent
training
eight sets of chest and then eight sets
of back and then later in the week do
eight sets of vacuum later eight cents a
chest
as we're training chest as we're
training 16 sets
simplest way to put it systemic fatigue
which does not contribute
to hypertrophy and lowers your sfr
goes like that
as you're training your chest
your local fatigue in your chest goes
like this
and remember local fatigue is a little
bit hypertrophic
because metabolites are hypertrophic
because the disruption is hypertrophic
because the pump is hypertrophy
because the fraction of effective reps
begins to rise that hypertrophy
now of course local fatigue has its
downsides too after too much of it is
accumulated but at least has some
upsides
so if we're looking at a ratio of local
fatigue to systemic fatigue we want it
as high as possible the higher this
ratio is the better our sfr is
if we do some chest
and then switch to back that's eight
sets okay
at the end of those eight sets systemic
fatigue is exactly as high it would be
after end of any eight cents
but you never summed a ton of local
fatigue in either one of these muscle
groups because you split them up
now we go with those four and four and
move them over and now we do four chests
and four back again same exercise now
16 sets our systemic fatigue is fucking
crazy would be anyway
but we start doing chest and we've lost
a bunch of local fatigue because it got
washed out
and now we're doing chests where the
local fatigue is not not that great but
the systemic is as high as it ever was
so that ratio starts to degrade which is
not great
so if we're training a muscle group as
soon as we begin to train it
there's something to be said because of
that local systemic ratio
keep pounding it it's like letting an
opponent get up after you punch them
don't let them get up
go tackle them back down and finish the
fight so to speak
because the more you can rain punches
the more at some point you're going to
finish the job
and if you get up and they get a chance
to regroup you have to do that many more
punches to finish the job
you may have noticed this in your own
training that if you split up a bunch of
muscles within a training session and go
back to old muscles
you don't get a sore you don't get as
good of a pump that's a sign that you're
not
summating enough actual stimulus acute
fatigue never gets that high
but the systemic is always a problem so
when you have a choice
it seems like by a small margin you
might want to favor
when you do chest and back together do
your chest finish it do your back and
you could say but dr mike
hold on that means we're training back
last all the time that sucks it totally
does
that's why another day when you train
chest and back you do back first
and chest second that way you get the
clustering effect of training the muscle
groups contiguously
but without the downside of having one
of them take over the other completely
next up this one's really
straightforward sfr a number of
uh sets per session okay so
as you do more work your systemic
fatigue goes up
that sucks that lowers your sfr
and as you do more work with some
caveats that we discussed already
your stimulus goes down terrible
so the more number of uh you know the
more you do as far as
uh sets per session kind of the worse it
gets on average now
however somebody could say okay that
means that we should do as many
different sessions as possible but we
have another problem if you do three or
four sessions
sessions per day so you come in and do
five sets and leave and then come back
to the gym let's say you live at the gym
is that better well there's a problem
there because your stress hormone levels
are kind of always elevated
and there's no distinct time to relax
that becomes
uh you know a problem for
parasympathetic downtime essentially
you know humans aren't designed you
could also try this with sleep for
example
you could try work for four hours sleep
for hours work for our sleep problems
human beings are not designed like that
maybe no systems are designed like that
seems like physiological systems on
planet earth like distinct stimulative
times
in very distinct prolonged times of no
stimulus relaxation or recovery that's
fundamentally the sr or the sra
principle stimulus recovery adaptation
and because once you get into the gym
and you get warmed up and you get pumped
you're pretty good that warm-up effect
that rise in catecholamine levels that
like
i'm ready to be here if you just do five
sets and leave
these catecholamines hang around and
catabolize for no reason for an extra
hour every day
if you do like three or four sessions
but if you only do like one or two
sessions
they rise you train hard they fall and
then you relax
and repeat so too many sessions that's
actually not a good solution to this
problem but the answer sure as hell
isn't one session per day
so if you want to ask yourself what's
the optimal number of sets per session
anything beyond 20 is probably not great
and you could say oh holy shit
if i only train four times a week i have
to get 30 sessions 30 sets every session
in order to make sure i get all the
hypertrophy you need that's totally fine
remember
sfr is cool but raw stem is what you're
going for fundamentally like you just
have to go with some muscle and you
can't train more than four times a week
that means you're gonna have to bite the
bullet a little bit it's okay there's no
solution to that problem
unless you want to use more sets or
sorry unless you want to use
more sessions in which case you for sure
should and then the question to be asked
well how many is too many
i would say the most number of sessions
i would prescribe
based on reading literature and working
with a bunch of athletes and just
thinking this stuff through
is probably 12 per week that is to say
one day a week i firmly believe should
almost always be used for dedicated
total rest remember that sra idea
and then you could potentially have a am
and a pm
every single day of the week steve hall
from revive stronger trades like that
jared feather has trained like that many
times i've trained like that to be
honest i couldn't survive the
the 12. i've done 11 sessions i've done
nine sessions
very very fruitfully nine sessions means
three of the days i train once a week or
sorry three of the days of the week i
trained once
and three i trained twice right but
certainly the answer because the fewer
sets you do in any one session
the better the sfr is for that session
the answer is almost never
trained four times a week there are pro
bodybuilders that train four or five
times a week
i can almost certainly assure you that
they could be better if they trained
more times per week in olympic
weightlifting and other sports like that
that's unheard of
right top people in brazilian jiu jitsu
olympic weightlifting wrestling they all
train multiple times a day
sometimes one a day sometimes two a day
sometimes three days if the sessions are
especially very easy
but almost nobody does four or five a
day training because that tends to do
all those things we talked about that
are bad all right
weekly volume and this is kind of a uh
much shorter talk than it was going to
be because of rehashing that
that whole uh dead zone concept mv to
mev
so for beginners the lower the volume
the highest stimulus to fatigue ratio
which is to say you know each additional
set brings uh
lower and lower stimulus rate each
additional set brings higher and higher
fatigue so sfr is best on set number one
so if someone asks you know what's the
most efficient way to train for a
beginner i would say
train like once a week and for a couple
of weeks you'll get
really efficient gains sorry efficient
uh
economical gains by sfr fast sfr
so you put the least amount of work in
get the best results for that level of
work not best absolute results
and then eventually you do two sessions
a week and then three and then four and
then so on and so forth and build up the
volume there so the lower the volume
better one working set per week and then
eventually two working sets four or five
six blah blah blah
for intermediate advanced we have that
problem we talked about earlier where
here's your minimum effect of volume
here's your maintenance volume
and the anything up to about five sets
per week could just be going from
maintenance volume
to not yet minimum effective this is
what we call in the how much should i
train book
uh the dead zone the volume dead zone
between maintenance volume and
effective volume it's more volume than
you need to maintain
but um not enough volume to do anything
for you uh as far as growth it's kind of
like um
you know if you're like really really
hungry for a meal and you want to have
like a really good quality meal
and someone's like hey do you want to
wait for the sushi place to open or do
you want like this half of a stale
cheeseburger
you're like well you know nothing's
going to happen to me if i don't eat
right now so i'm above maintenance
volume for eating
if i have this halfway steel
cheeseburger it's not going to take me
to my minimum effective sort of
enjoyment of eating
no thanks right i'm sure you guys have
done this before where someone's like
you can have a snack now and you can
wait you're like
fuck it i'll wait because this is dog
shit it's in between some kind of zone
of like yes it's technically food
but also it's awful so it doesn't hit
any of the boxes
right so when you're intermediate the
best safaris don't actually occur at the
lowest volumes
they occur at volumes just above your
minimum effective and when you're
advanced super advanced
they also occur just above minimum
effective but your main effect is now
real high
so for super advanced athletes their
best sfrs are actually at very high
volumes because
nothing short of those volumes is going
to grow them
pretty straightforward
weekly frequency very straightforward
if you have too low of a frequency you
excessively damage the muscles each
session
right you try to do 15 sets of chest on
monday and then repeat next monday you
get so much damage that half of that
goes to chopping off growth and you
don't get the best sfrs
on the other hand if you have a very
very high frequency you decided you're
gonna do
train chest eight times a week or
something like that especially joints
and connective tissues cannot seem to
keep up with that sort of thing
so what ends up happening is that also
drops your sfr so
the best sfrs are probably somewhere in
the middle of frequency
which is like two to four sessions per
muscle group per week
in many cases not all sometimes you can
do less sometimes you can do more
that's a really good shotgun approach to
where your best sfrs are going to be
sfr and weekly exercise selection number
this answers the question of okay
i have three quad workouts this week do
i do leg press squat leg extension or do
we do squat squat squat or do i do
uh you know leg press leg press leg
extension which one of those is better
from an sfr perspective well if
you switch exercise every single session
you
might miss out on some technical
improvements because if you do squat
squat squat you're practicing the squat
every single time which is a good thing
your technique improves and your sfr
might improve as well
but right that might just be a
mitigating factor
uh you you might not have such technical
improvements that are so awesome
and also you have an overuse problem
there where if you squat three times a
week
yes you might get a little better at
squatting and better mind muscle
but also you're overusing so your
stainless builds up faster and also just
your joints can't take it after a while
and that drops the sfr by itself even if
you know the muscle doesn't feel stale
so
it's probably okay to use like
the same exercise twice in one week so
you could have like heavy bent rows
monday
lighter bent rows after pulldowns
wednesday and then when you need to do
another horizontal movement friday
maybe do machine rows or something like
that so it's okay to double up on
movements but any more than doubling is
probably not great
and if you switch movements every single
time especially with super high
frequency you might just run out of
effective movements
or you're switching movements so much
there's some directed adaptation that
becomes missing there so
if you have lots of sessions more than
two it's okay and maybe even optimal to
reuse one of the movements
for the same general plane uh reuse it
once which is to say do it twice a week
but i probably wouldn't do the same
exercise more than twice a week even if
i was training with high frequency
similar exercises fine probably not the
same one really really minor point there
all right sfr
and cumulative fatigues over the metals
and blocks
we already know over the career of the
sfr falls but no surprise here
over the mesocycles okay over the meso
itself
and over the training block fatigue
rises over the weeks and weeks and weeks
period at first your raw stimulus
magnitude is pretty stable
because novelty is a good thing but it
can be
too much of a good thing where you're so
novel you can't even so new exercise
you haven't even learned how to recruit
your fastest twitch motor units because
it's so unstable and weird for you
as you get more practice of it weeks and
weeks and weeks you can recruit it more
which is why you see strength go up real
fast in the first couple weeks
your nervous system they say you know
your nervous system learns to use it
better
that's another way of seeing and it gets
more juice out of that muscle which is
another way of saying your raw stimulus
magnitude goes up
so the first mesocycle might be really
good raw stimulus magnitude your second
might be even better but your third
starts to get worse
because of that stimulus as fatigue
decreases your pumps your mind muscle
metabolite and so on and so forth right
so
fatigue goes up exponentially especially
with every metacycle
especially for joint and connective
tissue component of fatigue
so d loads huge big picture point
d-loads are critical to resetting sfrs
if you don't de-load can you still make
gains that next week probably but your
stimulus is going to be like that and
your fatigue is going to be like that
it's just stupid take a de-load so your
stimulus starts to be like this and your
fatigue starts to be like that and you
can rerun the program again
right and then low volume and active
rest
uh blocks or sorry phases between blocks
or within blocks
before your next training block of three
or four messes at a time
probably a really good idea for
resetting your sfr
fundamentally we have a conundrum here
right here's some really cool sort of
mathematical implication your sfr
falls every single week that you're
training in an accumulation
but if you take a load it's um
your have terrible sfr because the
stimulus of a dealer is effectively zero
it's the worst possible thing but as you
do that week
your sfr potential goes back up and then
you do it again so it's kind of like
uh oh here race car analogy happens to
be the perfect analogy there's analogous
on every single front
it's the pit stop analogy think of
dealers like pit stops
right if you take a pit stop do you lose
laps
fuck yeah the other guys are doing this
and you're fucking sitting there it's
awful
but your sfr so to speak your ability to
keep doing good laps
is rising the entire time like every
bolt they tighten your ability to do
laps goes up
so it's not time wasted it's time used
so another way to ask the question of
how often should i deload is
what's going to give you another
mesocycle of good results
is it taking a week to reset or
is it not taking a week and just going
another week to keep going
right so when people ask a lot of times
hey
how do i go from doing a four week
accumulation to a five week accumulation
another way to ask it is how do i get
this much extra gain using a whole
fucking week to do that by the way
this much fatigue where i could just
deload get
no gains but fatigue goes down and then
restart them as where i get this much
gain but this much fatigue
so is it good idea to think about how do
i stop having two mesocycle
accumulations or sorry two week
accumulations which is awful
and go to three and four that's worth
the trade-off that's worth the pit stop
right that's like going around you've
been doing two laps and you need to pit
we need to change something so you can
do like 50 laps in pin
but if you're doing 50 laps and pitting
ask yourself how do i do 75 laps in
pitting
you'll have to admit that that means the
laps 50 through
75 those last 25 flaps suck you don't
want to do that you just want to pit
so that sort of plays out the deload
isn't just to get rid of the fatigue and
so on and so forth
it's to reset your sfrs higher the
dealer should prepare you for another
couple of weeks of awesome training
which means there's a balance there for
most people it occurs around four to six
weeks
so big picture
you have to train to get a given raw
stimulus magnitudes find a melee the
reason you come to the gym is to
simulate muscle growth fatigue is a
byproduct it should be discussed as such
but fundamentally you're getting the gym
to get some amount of muscle you have to
do
whatever inputs it takes to get that
amount muscle frequency volume etc and
some of those
are not for the best sfrs they're just
not so you won't be able to get your
best sfr so don't
worry about it too much i wouldn't say
don't worry at all right worrying's not
productive don't even consider yourself
a ton with it
know that it's there within what you
have to do
like we have to do a 500 lap race so
we're going to have to pit
three times what would be the ideal
number of pit stops from an sfr
perspective
let's say it's one it's not three but
that would be one if you raised 150
miles not 500 so you have a certain
amount of training to do
so some sfrs are chopped off for you
automatically
get the best sfrs you can by considering
all the stuff
and then go from there folks that was
immediate
we'll see you next time for lecture
number 14. peace
