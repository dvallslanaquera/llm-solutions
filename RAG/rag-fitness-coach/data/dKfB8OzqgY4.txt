[Music]
folks i'm dr mike this is janae marie
krashaleski
yes hell yeah i got it right and janae
made a terrible mistake she showed up
for a back workout full rom style janae
how do you feel uh
before going into this uh knowing i made
a mistake excellent and that's the first
step on the way to recovery folks let's
get into it we are going to do some
vertical pulling we're going to kind of
see what we've got going on warm up we
got some cool toys to play with and then
we're going to end probably with smith
machine bent rose that's kind of the the
staple today it's going to be pain it's
going to be suffering
it will be beautiful
[Music]
are pull-ups a good lat movement yes
they're good back movement in general an
amazing lat stimulus the thing is in
order to get pull-ups done properly you
should be able to do at least five to
ten of them on a first set again full
range of motion big stretch at the
bottom stretch out those lats
chin over bar at least that's how you
count them can you do them to your
clavicle if you're a real baller you can
even do them arnold style to your lower
chest touching every time that's if
you're like the strongest pull-up person
in the world either way standardize the
motion control the eccentric do a good
job so it's five to ten if you get
stronger and you're doing sets of 10 to
15 15 to 20 start adding weight we're
gonna do about three or four sets here
we'll see how janae does
yeah motherfuckers didn't know you would
get some karate kid shit boom let's do
it all right so a set close to failure
only good ones if you can't touch the
chin the set is over okay
good big stretch
excellent
oh yeah
fuck yeah one more
last one coming up
[Music]
yes slow
stretch
let go
perfect
good shit good shit very
good this is what janae is drinking
during her workout now
i'm a sports scientist so i know what it
is
do you know what it is
think of your answer go
anti-freeze yes you know what i'm saying
because we're on that cyborg shit
you want to be a machine
you got to do machine shit
a solid five here
i literally haven't trained back in
months so your back is literally fucking
big for 19 months
beautiful control
perfect
excellent
good one last one get your shit together
janae
go slow
slow slow all the way down slow big
stretch
and that's it
good stuff
good stuff very good are we done no
get the fuck off
pretend you can be done that time you
know what i'm done with you
you guys will notice that when janae is
done with her last concentric portion of
the pull-up i remind her to keep slow on
the eccentric all the way down to the
full stretch the stimulus you can give
on the eccentric on your last drop is
quite high your muscles are already very
fatigued they're very prone to damage
they're very prone to stimulus the last
thing you want to do is after you finish
the concentric of your last drop is just
kind of dump off the pain is so great
and because you've accomplished the reps
it's easy to be like i'm done fuck out
of here but if you milk that last rep it
gives you just a bit more growth already
up there you might as well get the
growth give that some thought for your
own training all right ginny good
technique
easy money
good
[Music]
up up up up
slow
slow
slow
full hang for a second
and relax good stuff that's it that's
all for pull-ups
excellent
[Music]
we are going to try
some pull-downs a little bit differently
than many folks have done the pull down
the first thing you guys get to do is
laugh at how inadequately tall i am
watch this i said
i can't reach
so in order to do demo i have to get up
oh like this and i'm scared of heights
so this is doubly bad
i grab is the handles janae you're of
adult height so you'll be fine
grab the handles
and then i take a little slide down
and what we want to do once we get nice
and cozy
is normally i would pull to the clavicle
but this gives us a good angle an
opportunity to pull down to the lower
part of the sternum so at the top we're
pushed forward and stretched you can
lean back a little bit when you go back
whatever's comfy but at the end what we
want to do is put the shit down here
so big stretch and a gentle touch right
below the chest
that really kicks the lats into high
gear that's a technical term
machines are scary let's see what janae
thinks about this down here or lower yes
no no give it a shot again
good stay more upright the entire time
yes
just like that big stretch
yep at the top i want you to lean
forward as it stretches lean forward
okay gotcha and then at the bottom like
this yes yes absolutely all right
uh let's get close to failure okay uh
only good technique big full stretch at
the top
mini arch and a full touch at the bottom
okay try to get your hands to push like
this
it'll help you contract the lats a
little bit okay
and just fyi i'm already a failure in my
father's eyes
it's fucking weird
don't worry girl we're all failures
all right slide under very good nice and
stable
beautiful
don't hold it down there gentle touching
come right back okay
yes perfect

folks
one last exercise left three sets of
smith machine bent over rows y smith
machine just a variation far a bunch of
rows are still king smith works just
fine the cybex smith we have is
incredible
it is uh
so smooth that many analogies have been
made
as to how smooth it is but since you
know i don't want to go off on any crazy
tangents i'll just shut the fuck up and
tell you
three sets of 10 to 20 reps on the bench
of a row let's meet up with janae see
how she feels about it boom
[Music]
hey do you want to like go on a date
with me
okay
hey
we're going on a date cool
yeah
[Music]
here's we had a little problem a little
problem ski come follow me here
so the smith machine is a fine piece
the problem is
how you're supposed to get full range of
motion there's a whole lot of space here
as the lowest it goes we have to solve
this problem by elevating the floor
making a platform
now a lot of platforms are too big
but guess what isn't too big
shut up
mega-sized pizza dough
that's how
grandpa did it
that's how dad did it
a lot of you guys don't know
i'm actually pure 100
sicilian heritage
so hey
fucking pizza no problem
we put the pizza dough
here
and we can get any elevation we like
even to a deficit good quality set all
right focus on the big eccentric at the
bottom
don't let the ship punk you out it's
going to want to keep doing this stay
nice and upright big chest at the bottom
gentle touch big chest at the bottom and
then shoulders down okay chest up
shoulders down okay
we're shooting for like
g you know 15 to 20 good reps
zero momentum zero hip hinge okay
no more okay
big stretch good
two keep the chest up
yes
three the whole time
four
perfect five
six chest up
yes
seven
eight perfect cadence
nine
ten chest up
11
12 no bullshit strict only
13 that's it 12 rack
good
very good
having trouble finishing that
contraction yeah yeah do you want us to
make it easier for you somehow so you
feel better about yourself
no
self-hatred isn't gonna change
good
good keep that chest up
yes
perfect
stretch
yes
good
good four more
one chest up
two
let's get it together one last one go
that's it very good
very good
all right so a lot of you've been asking
me all sorts of questions like hey mike
if i want to attract someone at the
other end of the gym how do i
while keeping the community safe
show them that i like them the answer is
quite simple you see
let's say you're the camera you're the
person looking at me and i'm between
sets
oh hey uh yeah i'll just kind of
it's no big deal but got hanging hams
you don't have to say these things but
if you whisper themselves them to
yourself it's better and then at some
point this person will probably walk
over like watch i'll do it to my wife
watch this check this out where she
no big deal just hanging around hanging
hams
i'm sorry did you say something what you
think about these hanging hams
oh is that what those are yeah yeah
100 fun
success
good big stretch

two big stretch
three big stretch
chest
up good
two more
one more good one
fuck yeah one more let's go janae
yes again one last one
good technique good that's it that's it
solid how was it
surprisingly difficult for the amount of
weight we're using yeah because of all
that rom shit huh
folks i only have one selling point for
team full rom
if you want to use pathetically light
weights so that nobody's ever impressed
with your lifting but you want to look
jacked look us up we're in the yellow
pages all right folks that was a workout
nice simple straightforward back workout
janae how'd it feel awesome
excellent all right a woman of few words
but you know what i'm saying so much
of this anyway before i get cancelled
