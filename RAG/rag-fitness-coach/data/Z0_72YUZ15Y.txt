hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization healthy eating made simple
video number six
weight loss phases doing them right
if you haven't seen the other five
videos they're in this playlist please
watch them they're super awesome i was
in them so they have to be great yikes
give them a look and then we're gonna
pick up so where we are
after these five videos we know how to
eat healthy
okay we know how to choose healthy foods
we know how to make balanced meals we
know how to count macros
we know how to eat in a stable pattern
day to day so we're super used to our
awesome schedule
and we know how to take the right
supplements and hydrate properly
now once you're rolling with all these
there's a pretty decent chance that
you're already within a healthy weight
range
and you don't have to gain or lose
weight to be healthy and you're kind of
done
you just continue to eat this way a
later video of ours we'll talk about
balance and how to make sure you balance
all the rest of your life but
honestly you're 95 of the way there
however
your weight could be stabilized even
after making all these
awesome changes a little bit outside the
range it could be below the range it
could be above the range
we're going to learn today in this video
how to get your weight into
that healthy range or closer to it now
the healthy range what is it
it's different than those insurance
tables you saw when you were a kid
that's an ideal weight for a man who's 5
10
this thing is ideal there's a huge broad
range
at every height of individual for men
and women
this table is a good representation of
it it's from our book of renaissance
periodization understanding healthy
eating there's going to be a link in the
description you can check that book out
if you'd like
let's take an example okay for someone
who is
five foot five let's say a female that's
five foot five
it is very likely that if someone is
between 105 pounds at five
five and all the way up to 180 pounds of
five five yep
that they're as healthy as they can be
and weight loss or gain doesn't make
them any healthier
okay now if you're a female and you're
five foot five
and you're above 180 if you're 230
pounds
it's likely that losing weight will
significantly improve your health
but as soon as you get below 180 in the
average case
it's not immediately apparent that
weight loss is going to make you
healthier if you're super athletic
if you're just heavyset if you're jacked
then
you may be a female who is five five 175
the best health of her life in losing
weight might make you
no healthier thus making it relatively
pointless it could just be done for
aesthetic reasons at that point or it
can make you even less healthy
and on the other end if you're 105
pounds at 5'5
it's very possible that gaining a little
bit of weight could make you healthier
but 50 50 maybe not now if you're a
female and you weigh 80 pounds at five
foot five
getting larger will almost certainly
make you healthier
so that's going to be our first quick
topic
gaining weight how do you gain weight to
become healthier so if you're under the
healthy weight range
for your height gaining weight will
likely make you healthier not always
so you have to confirm with your doctor
first but if you're under the range the
doctor may say yeah actually gaining a
bit of weight
especially muscle is a really really
good idea to probably make you healthier
right so while being physically active
as much as possible and preferably
highly preferably doing resistance
training which tons of our other videos
on this channel describe
you want to eat your normal healthy diet
per video number fives
if your videos one through five you want
to eat your normal healthy diet like
that but you're going to make a couple
of changes
you're going to add in larger portions
specifically if carbohydrate-rich foods
and fats whatever fits your taste have a
bit extra there
and you can feel free to add two to six
depending on how much weight you want to
gain and how much
junk food you want to eat two to six
purposeful fun meals which can be pretty
junky or they can just be
pretty healthy but of very high calories
on top of your weekly intake so maybe
you eat your normal days food and then
you give ben and jerry a call and they
show up with a pint of ice cream you eat
half a pint
you put in the fridge you eat half the
next day and so on and so forth that way
you can slowly gain weight
into your healthy range potentially now
there's many more details we can go into
tons of our other videos on this channel
cover
how to gain weight there's a nutrition
for muscle gain video you can just type
right into the youtube
rp or renaissance preparation nutrition
for muscle gain it'll come up
tons of videos super in depth here's the
thing though
most people that are unhealthy in the
modern world
are unhealthy for a combination of
factors which usually don't involve them
being
too underweight sometimes that's the
case and if that's the case
this is part of the solution but many
more times
those folks are unhealthy and one of the
contributing factors
is they're a little bit on the heavier
side sometimes a lot on the heavier side
so let's take a look at the much more
common problem
of being a little too heavy and thus
potentially losing weight to become
more healthy three-step process here
really really straightforward step one
confirm with your doctor that weight
loss is safe for you
that this is a good idea and that it
will likely improve your health because
it could be other stuff going on that
has nothing to do with your weight
if you're within the healthy range
losing weight may not make you healthier
at all and as a matter of fact it's
likely not to so if you're within that
healthy range and if you take a look
back a couple of slides
see where you are on that height chart
really weight loss comes down to just an
aesthetic preference if you want to lose
weight just to look leaner or thinner or
whatever
totally fine your call but in many cases
weight loss just isn't the answer to
improved health
probably in most cases but if you're
well without outside that range it may
be as
part of your solution for better health
confirm with your doctor and then move
on to step number two
what you're going to do is you're going
to take your current diet and you're
going to subtract away
daily fat and carb macronutrients and we
learned that in one of the videos how to
count those macros and convert them to
calories
and you're going to create a 500 calorie
deficit so remember fats are 9 calories
per gram
carbohydrates are four calories per gram
you've got to remove enough grams of one
or both or the other
to make a 500 calorie total deficit less
than what you're normally eating so if
you're normally eating 2 500 calories a
day
you've got to take some carbs and fats
out to get to 2 000. perfect example now
if you're significantly under 150 pounds
maybe just remove 300 calories
if you're significantly over 250 then
maybe remove as many as 700 calories
because you want to keep on pace
relatively to your body weight now
here's a real big kicker
you want to continue to stay just as
active as you ever were if not
more so to keep that burn side of the
equation
up and then the intake side of the
equation falls down
and you will absolutely lose weight and
because you're active and hopefully
resistance training and eating super
well
you're gonna lose almost exclusively fat
and no muscle and your health will
improve
step three is to just repeat this
process every day
sticking to that 500 calorie deficit
that new diet you have
for about six to nine weeks at a time
less than six weeks probably isn't
enough to make a really big dent in your
body weight and your health
nine weeks and more especially for
beginners like you
is a bit too much to bite off to chew
and you want to start with a solid diet
between those two
and then you're going to ease up and
we're going to talk about that next time
during
the six to nine fat loss diet weeks
where you're purposefully manipulating
your diet to lose fat
you want to probably stay away from most
junk food zero junk would be an idea so
just stick to the healthy stuff don't
worry junk food's going to make a
comeback later on
when you've lost the weight and kept it
off for a little bit of time
you want to make sure to weigh in
probably a few times a week to make sure
you're on track
if for two weeks straight you're
actually not losing any more weight or
you're losing it very slowly
then what you can do is reduce your
carbs and fats
another 200 to 400 calories you probably
only have to do that once maybe twice
and then boom the six to nine weeks is
over
you've lost a considerable amount of
weight considered a lot of fat and you
are now
healthier now quick shameless plug
before we continue and wrap up this
video
the rp diet app which has sponsored this
video in a sense
can do all of this for you just type in
all your information it literally tells
you what to eat and
plugs you in and it measures all your
stuff for you all you do is step on the
scale
tell it how much you weigh and it auto
adjusts everything no counting no
calories no 400 200 500 none of that
stuff you just do what it says and
that's it
right if tech isn't your thing you want
to print up a diet and put it on the
fridge
rp rather sensitization offers the
simple diet templates which are
literally pdf you print them out your
printer
it's the simplest ad you'll ever do so
if you want to offload that intellectual
work
totally fine give those products look
now i design those products i make money
when you buy those products i'll be the
first person to tell you
don't need them you can use them and
they're awesome and super helpful that's
why we made them but if you don't want
to use them if you want to run your own
diet in your numbers
by all means that's why this video is
made so whichever choice you make
do that for a six to nine week diet and
you'll almost certainly weigh
less significantly less something like 5
to 15 pounds less
depending on a few factors how large you
started how big of a deficit
so on and so forth now here's the trick
lots of people lose weight but so
precious few of them
keep it off in the long term to continue
to be healthier
and that keeping it off in the long term
that transition
from your old body weight to your new
one that transition from diet
to continuing to promote that healthy
lifestyle at that lower weight
that's a big trick that's going to be
the subject of our next video and i'll
see you then
