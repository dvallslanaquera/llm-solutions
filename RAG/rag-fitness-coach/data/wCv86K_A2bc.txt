and the whole idea behind bracing and
blocking is to generate an even amount
of intra-abdominal pressure around your
entire core if you were just a regular
belt or power lifting valve or even
worse a skinny weightlifting belt yeah
the bottom or the top is good but the
rest is not you end up feeling like not
your best not your most stable Etc so I
got this belt made and now they actually
make a version of this just for anyone
to buy a Pioneer it works so goddamn
well try it if you're a power lifter
they don't allow these in regulation so
don't get used to training with it you
don't want to go back after this
