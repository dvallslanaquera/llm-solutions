hey folks it's me dr mike for
renaissance periodization and i have a
quick tip for you guys a snack hack
if you will and you don't have to
because hacking's a stupid term that
applies almost nothing
unflavored
nuts nuts
how nuts
here's the deal
when nuts peanuts almonds etc
are salted
and or flavored and or
covered in chocolate they tend to have a
assortment of features and assortment of
features that follows them along for the
average person they are a weight gain
nightmare because you can eat like a
trillion of them and they still taste
delicious so you're much more likely to
overeat your calories
and oftentimes without even noticing
like a whole netflix movie is gone and
you're like oh i guess i just had 5 000
calories of um chocolate covered almonds
oops
and if you're trying to manage your
weight
and if you have some appetite
challenges
flavored nuts are usually a terrible
terrible terrible terrible choice
now on the other hand
if the nuts are unsalted and unflavored
roasted is fine but unroasted raw is
even better for this
a lot of times for their calorie level
they impressively crush your hunger for
hours afterwards
they don't really make you want to eat a
thousand calories of them like i don't
know how many times you've been around
someone who's like oh my god almonds
these are great like
are they really i have one handful of
almonds and i'm interested in never
eating almonds again for my entire life
not that it's a terrible experience it's
just this kind of like blarg i don't
know meh
and interestingly enough there is at
least some direct research
in which they let people free feed on
almonds which you would think like holy
fuck these people are going to get
enormous
they
actually did not gain any weight free
feeding on almonds because they got so
full eating almonds they ate less of the
other stuff they had to through that day
and voila no net weight gain even though
they had no rule that we can't eat more
than this xyz it was totally fine
and if you are living the healthy
maintenance lifestyle
unsalted unflavored unchocolated
nuts of pretty much any kind can make
for a great snack now there's a slight
caveat here
for some people
they are so cool as a cucumber they can
eat a couple of chocolate covered
almonds and never gain weight some other
people
any kind of nuts are two nuts too many
and even regular almonds make them gain
weight like crazy because they just want
more more more know which one of those
you are by trial and error you may
already know for now and then snack
accordingly
but hold on a second there's one last
type of nuts that i failed to mention
these knots
i had to see you guys next time
