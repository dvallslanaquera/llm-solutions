oh yeah slow controlled
and delts just notes
that's good enough
[Music]
yeah it was it was okay
[Music]
YouTube YouTube YouTube
guess what I have me today I have me too
ifbb Pros
not me this guy Chad Caudill he's a
men's physique ifbb Pro which is fucking
hilarious because he's enormous I'm an
open bodybuilder but I ain't shit Jared
feather is a classic physique Pro she
had quickly hit a classic pose to remind
them boom you see how classic that was
can you do a men's physique pose real
quick
the whole thing it's all about this so
last time Chad was here you guys saw him
on the channel we annihilated chest and
triceps and even hit a bit of biceps too
this time while actually on his way out
he was like back
and we were like well yeah didn't get
enough scheduled him in for some reason
he came back a lot of people not so
interested in coming back after the
workouts Chad is the fucking man he's
back here we're gonna do back I texted
him earlier today he was like hey do you
want a thickness priority workout or a
width priority he said thickness
thickness is in let's get to it
foreign
big chest at the bottom so a lot of
people will do them right but then
they'll kind of go like this at the
bottom big chest so that way you're
really the t-spine is like curved a
little bit upper back so here so the
navel
you touch the tummy every time full
stretch to touch the ground every time
but your back never moves okay zero
heaving zero hoeing too
zero hoeing zero don't leave don't help
you can hear but don't hoe right so
before you pick it up let me know when
you're ready to pick it up and I'll give
you some more cues
ready so before you pick it up don't
pick it up just lift your chest up arch
your back more more more now
just in that position touch the tummy
yes touch it you don't have to pause
more control yeah touch gently through
the tummy no pause touch and down
control control and then control The
Eccentric slow
great control Gentle Touch all the way
down there you go good lower back looks
great man that's perfect
yep control that last bit of range of
motion too all the way down go ahead and
one more
slow and rack that's it those are great
man very good a little different
Dr Mike I can't get a big back
what do I do
barbell Monroe for the last time the
answer
if you want to roll for the lats here's
how you do it pick the shit up make sure
your dick's in alignment bam
no dick no problem
Rose that's a
10 to 20 maybe even 15 to 20 reps here
for Chad probably about four sets he's
just learning the technique the super
crazy super ROM technique for the first
time you guys see the mild deficit he's
a fucking killer though he's got a down
pat it's gonna be a total back
Annihilation and that gives us the
overall massive thickness stimulus we
need why because the row hits the middle
traps lower traps rhomboids Tara's major
lats spinal Erectors there is actually
not a part of the backs that the rose
doesn't hit and what else even the rear
delts those rear delts that you're like
how do I grow them
materials right I do zero rear don't
work because all of my pulling makes
murder one of my best chest
two chest up
three keep going fuck it keep going keep
going keep going and no bullshit either
yeah
good next time when you hit your last
rep slow it as if you're gonna do
another one and even a little extra let
that eccentric fuck you up one last time
and then just like a beautiful full
stretch arm forward and stand your heels
yes
come over there you go you're a couple
more
two more let's go big chest
one more swing and stretch
slow and
perfect
get that question mark face like what
the fuck
I've been doing apparent rolls wrong on
my left everybody we were also until we
figured out yeah
it's kind of cool though right because
when you do metros typically people are
like I need four plates like no you
don't get out of here yeah
how much do you weigh right now 260.
260. listen up this is insane 260
ifbb Pro 260 pound men's cozy competitor
doing 135 pounds on deficit Row for sets
of 10 to uh for sets of 15 to 20 getting
fucked up
little bitch damn I mean I didn't wasn't
gonna insult you but shit delete this
part off camera CGI more weights on that
I can't be seen like this
one the foam weights around here
I stop at the bottom yes
feel your shit stretching out like that
boom
more
one more we just we just we just
that's it slow slow and
bent Rose is the easiest and most
unequivocal thing ever you're like yep
we're done
it's almost worse than like straight
looking deadlifts well shit I hate those
all right ready for the next workout
keep these you're gonna need these again
Comes This Way
[Music]
I want you to pause at the very fucking
top for a split second pause and then go
just like that every single time and
you're going to notice that that pause
Burns living fuck out of your back
towards the higher reps crunch yes and
then a big full stretch
yep every time it has to hit the bottom
gently touch the bottom
up and then down and relax that's it
four sets of bottle event rows Down the
Hatch amazing Chad's super pumped but
now we take the Erectors at least the
lower Erectors out of play by sitting
him down on a machine the prime row
which I love the prime row is actually
leveraged and one of the ways you can
use it to get a super crazy cycle
stretch at the bottom and then make the
top nice and easy you get that awesome
decontraction and a big stretch it tends
to hit the middle upper back a ton
rhomboids all the musculature around
there it's going to be beautiful again
we're going to be doing sets of 10 to 20
reps typically results in a really good
sfr for the back you guys are going to
see we're going to be a big focus on the
super stretch and a big focus on a one
second pause at the top with the chest
up he will be rounding his back at the
bottom arching is back at the top why do
that Dr Mike because your back does that
and against resistance your back rows
chest over deep yes two
three last one make it good
four pole slow slow stretch rack
[Music]
the chest
there you go I swear I can feel your
back growing from over here let's go
beautiful good stretch man
[Music]
gorgeous
[Music]
you're a big chest
[Music]
three more
one let's go
[Music]
two stretch
fuck yeah
slow deep gentle
fuck yeah these knee pads are awesome
you like that yeah it's just like
fucking sets you right in and you can't
go anywhere yeah
usually like this oh it's awesome yeah I
really like this machine though ha take
that Jared Jared Pizza I really like
this one
three more
one two
[Applause]
three
down do not unstrap strap in harder
strap in taking a little weight off
when your strap do four more reps
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
good
[Music]
yep two more
[Music]
let's go slow gentle one last one now
it's right
strapping strap in strap in super
lightweight no pause at the top just
gonna do ten ten straight
slow eccentric one tiny fraction of a
second at the top
then go go
a little bit of fun at the last set hit
it boom slow
two down
[Music]
three
[Music]
seven big chest at the bottom yeah eight
yes
[Music]
two more
nine one last one big stretch
10.
that's it
yeah
that was dirty that was nasty shit good
stuff good stuff we'll leave that here
uh what attachment Mike
you know why don't we do dealer's choice
or Jared's Choice what do we think if
you Pros seems like some of these
techniques are kind of new so getting it
down with a regular bar is really smart
that's true yeah
[Music]
just pull Downs um I don't know how to
do these super well
Jared will take over as coach
yeah this is how do you reach this
obnoxious I stand on the thing why you
look at me ask me how I reach it okay
I'm on my TV I'm at least your height I
grew up right on the uh right on the
bend I really come forward yep I'm gonna
stretch you up completely you should
feel this tear apart keep going keep
going like basically some math fucking
neck with the dog and then down like
this and all the other chest yeah
so that's why I said grab a little
closer it's gonna be hard to set your
chest there you try
all the way up Let it stretch you
forward and up four sets of bent rows
four sets of prime machine rows now
we're probably gonna do three sets of
lat pull Downs three sets is fewer than
four of course and definitely fewer than
eight that we spent rowing and it's at
the end of the workout so it's less
efficacious but that is the nature of a
thickness or horizontal emphasis back
workout which this is you can't
emphasize everything it's got to be one
or the other so we say why does he do
more pull Downs well that's for another
time in his workout maybe a workout
later on of the week maybe another
different muscle cycle where he's
emphasizing with TBH is wide as fuck so
that might not need to happen for a
while and uh yeah just three sets of
pull Downs 10 to 20 reps each time coach
Jared here is gonna again gonna be given
the cues because pull down to me is just
another opportunity to express my badass
three as a fucking wild animal brother I
can't be caged into this fucking
bullshit full ROM technique I'm out of
RP autofill rum fuck all y'all
come on baby yeah anyway let's do some
work
just up chest up chest up there it is
I'll stop that stretch I'm gonna pull
you for like a full second up up up
there you go perfect
yeah that's good
[Music]
oh my God that's it
ouch yeah it's like I don't know how I
want to stretch and my body won't let me
stretch it out this hurts
yes there you go lean forward
up and forward yes
the Big Stretch
there you go
that was a perfect record
oh fuck yeah
shit man
[Music]
all day
control that last bit of the range of
motion full stretch let it pull you let
it pull you and then up there you go
a couple more
stretch
big chest come on
chest up
slow stretch rack
good set
very good very good have some water have
a seat we will be on our last exercise
Scott can I move here can I move your
Gandalf staff you shall not film without
a thing to put your camera on to do this
that's what this is for you guys didn't
know your boys in Hollywood
[Music]
last exercise for the day it's back
thickness and stuff but Chad want to
build dealt stuff because you can never
have two big adults for men's physique
um super arm laterals of course myo reps
of course so we're going to do my rep
match we're gonna let him do a single
set very close to failure and whatever
reps he gets on that for the next three
sets after that four sets total he's
gonna have to match that first sets reps
no matter how many mini sets it takes
with three to five second breaks in
between full range of motion super
control on the bottom
ouch let's do it start down here
with zero momentum only with your
shoulders
elbows relatively straight or completely
straight dealer's choice
come all the way up as high as you can
and then slow it on the way down the
Temptation is to come up controlled and
then kind of Let It Go like this come up
under control and then slow slow slow
slow slow
and back up technique is number one the
first thing it's going to try to go on
you is this is going to start to get
fast we're going to yell at you for you
not to do that control the eccentric
cool let's get it done
[Music]
oh yeah come on four more
[Music]
let's go one slow
yep
[Music]
two small belts
and we're gonna no momentum delts there
you go three so one more we have come in
you got it you got it
good stuff
Chad did you get a count on that
ah 21. like four more was that was that
15. somewhere around there so it's a 19.
let's call it 20 or 20 that's fine
twenty twenty for my reps 20 for my reps
see you have another three sets of 20.
all right but you get a three to five
second rest break as many times you need
to take it in each one of those sets to
just get to 20. okay one more
off slow rap Jesus
V12
so what so how do you know it's gonna be
12. we're doing this a while you know
