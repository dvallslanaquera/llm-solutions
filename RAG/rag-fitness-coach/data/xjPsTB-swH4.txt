hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
uh here's a question how much stronger
do steroids make you a very common
question
and quite controversial
if you agree with what i'll be saying in
a little bit please comment if you
disagree please comment it boosts the
algorithm
it makes us the money and then we take
the money and we go to the lamborghini
dealership and and
usually uh um it's a couple of really
big penny jars i'll bring in
they count them and then i
i drive away
with uh
scott what's a good color for my next
lambo
you gotta go with the classic red like
you have the poster on the wall as a kid
audacious red
people are looking at you
and you're like wow
he made it or as a tiny dick or both as
is true in my case
except they don't have a lambo
yeah it's not a joke
says my
sex doctor
anyway steroids and strength so here's
the deal
this is a cheat video because greg
knuckles as is usually the case in his
utter brilliance has already probably
authored the definitive article on this
i would google it you know how to use
the google
and
it actually is uh greg now has a sort of
compendium of three articles
that sort of feed into each other it's
all linked in one hyperlink article so
yahoo easy for you to find
but
the core article here
mr greg knuckles did an excellent
analysis and essentially did the
following
he compared lifters in drug tested
federations
and compared them against lifters in
untested federations
and
saw what the strength difference was
with all the world record lifts and
national record lifts etc
and sort of uh tried to figure out okay
what's the percent difference here and
he found that there's roughly 10 now
it's a bit different for each weight
class a bit different for males and
females or some nuance there but an
average of about 10 percent now
you may
think yourself clever
and go uh
hold on doctor mike and by proxy greg
knuckles
everyone in these tested federations is
cheating
because they are stronger than me and
have to be cheating
and thus it's all bullshit
so yeah you might have some point there
are certainly some cheating going on in
natural feds but if you've been around
powerlifting especially in the united
states um
you know that uh cheating is just not
rampant in drug tested powerlifting
because like i've been around the sport
for a long time
there's just not a lot of people
cheating
um it because i know them
and uh they're just fucking drug-free
man a lot of them are like wacky no
offense like super anti-drug
irrationally anti-drug people that think
like vitamins are cheating and shit like
that
so and some of them do in fact hold
national award records
so uh and i know several people
personally that have broken national
world records drug-free and they are
legit drug-free because yes we are that
close and
not only would they tell me if they were
using drugs i may be the person they
would ask how to use the drugs and how
to evade the test something i have been
asked before i never render an opinion
on because cheating is fucking bullshit
but i have been asked numerous times by
people
uh in other sports and other contexts
and almost never was it in powerlifting
so
i don't think my personal opinion you
may disagree with it that cheating is a
really big problem and
in a huge way alters these numbers
however
uh yeah we'll say okay ten percent's too
low fine is twelve percent twelve
percent it's not fifty percent drugs
don't make you fifty percent stronger
it's not even twenty five percent
let's say it's half that still twelve
percent
okay that's not that much
weird now
another line of
evidence is a strong term for this
another line of generalization
is that
i've been on power lifting for a super
long time mr coach powerlifting used to
be a competitive power lifter don't
bother googling me i sucked
uh and i actually only ever competed
drug free but um
in an alternate universe i actually did
make the switch from
being drug free to not being drug free
and i continued and still continued to
do the core moves for years and for a
long time i was doing almost exclusively
core moves like squat bench deadlift etc
on drugs versus off never competed on
drugs but
uh gee whiz that 10 is
i didn't even get that much out of it
uh and and tons and tons and tons of
people have been around the sport who
have been both natty and on gear
most of them will tell you
like and not like oh yeah drugs barely
help kids stay drug free not that kind
of bullshit like they'll level with you
if you're cool with them and if you know
them well they'd be like yeah like
drugs definitely help
but just not as much as you would have
hoped
so when you know because if they say
like hey listen you know like the old
anti-doping campaign's like
don't do marijuana it's gonna make you
crazy and it'll feel terrible like
fucking lie you talk to people that use
pot or whatever and they're like it's
awesome you're like oh shit there's two
different stories here but you look at
the records and the difference between
nanny and uh tested and untested records
like it's not a big difference maybe 10
to 15 somewhere and then you talk to
actual powerlifters and they're like
yeah like i wish it was like a trillion
fucking pounds that added to my total
but it really just wasn't that much now
of course it was something and of course
it makes a difference but yeah like
maybe 10 to 15 and it's not like 25 it's
not 50
it's not crazy wild hopes and dreams
now
that's weight class equated so that
means that if you for example
take you drug-free and you lift in 165
weight class 165 pounds and then you
take drugs you may add hundreds of
pounds to your total but the primary
modality through which that occurs is
the addition of muscle mass now you're
198 or 181 and yeah you're totally
hundreds of pounds more but you're not
compared to those your old numbers
you're compared now to the 198 drug-free
world champion you may look over and be
like oh shit he's still stronger than me
fuck right so per weight class the
effect isn't big but how much can you
expect to add for yourself if you get on
steroids for example
it's actually much more in many cases
than 10 or 12 percent not all cases
because gee whiz you can add a shitload
of muscle now immediately the sharp ones
of you one of the sharp ones of the lot
may think oh hold on so that means super
heavier power lifters because they don't
have a muscle cap should have a bigger
difference between their untested and
tested uh varieties and that are sorry
tested and untested and because you know
they can add muscle mass and they're not
worried about weight caps well there's
another problem there so empirically
there's actually not a huge difference
between those two they're it's roughly
the same right about ten percent you
think fuck are all supers just on drugs
already that's not it i suspect it's the
following
when you get really really muscular
it decreases
your for lack of a better term
strength weight ratio
per like cross-sectional area of muscle
or per volume of muscle your strength
doesn't improve nearly as much as you
would expect and that effect tends to
exaggerate itself as you get bigger but
also you get into mobility and
flexibility problems for example
in the weightlifting moves because you
know some strength is displayed in
weightlifting moves snatch clean and
jerk
if you get big ass arms you actually
can't rack the cleaning you unsure
yourself can't rack a clean you can't
rack a clean
if you have enormous size legs and super
big chests and everything dead lifting
becomes hard because you're kind of
trying to deadlift around yourself
benching gets easier but hold on you
can't pull as much of an arch as you
used to so a lot of times getting hyper
muscular like supers that are on tons of
gear and ultra jacked they're not as
much stronger as you would expect
because they suffer from some leverage
advantages et cetera et cetera so
the super still don't win out in a big
way now of course it's a big deal 10 to
15 is a huge boost but it's not this
completely revolutionary amount it's
you're not going to turn into a
different person altogether and i'll get
more specific what i mean in just a
second
uh just covering steroids here but what
about like things like growth hormone
people ask oh but gh um gh tends to make
your muscles much more internally
hydrated which makes them look fucking
super cool i wouldn't be on gh of course
but uh yeah you just gotta have half a
pump all the time when you're in the gym
you have a fucking pump and a half
um
but that internal muscular water volume
boosts your body lead a ton it literally
boosts your lean mass which which water
is counted so on stage you look like a
fucking pimp because you're enormous
but you actually
are not much stronger if not at all
because the amount of actual contractile
tissue in your muscles is the same
now over time growth hormone helps grow
your contractile tissue but that puts us
back into the same problem within any
particular weight class he's just like
look if you're eight percent body fat
steroids not steroids it doesn't really
like you're just capped out you can't
put any more muscle on and then the
effects are marginal
yes uh growth hormone and other peptides
can reduce your injury risk in your
training they can help you recover they
do improve the process but not in some
magical way and the counterbalancing of
the increased weight and thus the
reduction of the strength to weight
ratio makes growth hormone just not a
real dependable strength drug especially
if you're heavier it can definitely part
of be part of a toolkit for powerlifting
but a lot of times you'll pull it out a
few weeks uh or a week before you
actually
step on the platform because you'll drop
a bunch of weight that way uh so it's
not it's not a miracle drug
unfortunately especially for strength
hypertrophy growth hormone is the bee's
knees it's it for strength it's
underwhelming compared to what people
expect from it
and that is also uh seen in powerlifting
culture so a lot of times you'll talk to
high-level polishers and be like hey
what about growth hormone the consensus
in powerlifting is kind of like
yeah
it's not like yeah for sure because
there are some drugs that are like
really dependably good at strength
increasing for example trend like trying
to learn acetate
most people will fucking just make you
nonsense strong that's where a lot of
that 10 percent can come from but growth
hormone very few people are like dude
you got to get on growth what are you
doing for powerlifting or for
weightlifting they're kind of like yeah
it'll help you recover and shit but a
lot of people
you know in the 80s untested power
lifters basically nobody used growth
hormones was not available to mass
markets and god damn they were strong as
fuck like almost as strong as the guys
today so it's not this not this really
big deal
uh another quick point just to you know
sort of fill the brain up
there are really big differences in
acute and chronic effects
so over time
steroids can put on more muscle mass and
make your training more productive and
allow you to handle more volume and make
you stronger strength you keep uh for a
long time and that's one of the ways in
which that 10 percent is revealed but a
small fraction of the 10
is actually in short-term dosing acute
dosing of steroids that make you
stronger in the minutes and hours after
you take them in the hours realm as an
example though many stereos do this halo
testing phlox and masterone you take
halo 30 minutes later you become
rather upset
in general aggressive excited strong and
you feel strong in a way that doesn't
make any fucking sense and it does boost
strength just by a few percentage points
but gee a few percentage points fucking
that's pounds and pounds on your total
another one is check drops the technical
name is mobolarone and this is a drug
you take this unreal liver toxic from
what i understand
and it makes you
not happy
angry combative and gives you a little
boost and that only works for like a few
hours right so yeah you can take
steroids right before strength
competition and they do fucking work but
most of their oomph comes from taking
them for months and months and months
before the actual competition even years
and slowly building actual strength
all right so what are some implications
from this cause some of the shit i said
yeah
yes i did move my dick and nuts out of
the way
um you know what i'm saying when your
shit's kind of fucking tucked in they're
all weird my legs pretty much touch so
i won't say any more about this it'll be
our little secret
implications some of the shit i said is
kind of like really hmm
i'll uh step even more on that pedal
here we go and i know young male focus
is going to give me a ton of hate sweet
bring it up
first question which is the implication
here
uh if we take it
that steroids only boost strength by
maybe 15 between tested and untested
records
uh
that means
we have to ask the question of are
nadi's really that strong because if you
look at the
uh tested records the drug tested
records
and you like to knock off five percent
off of them because you're like fucking
cheaters and shit you're still left with
like bafflingly high numbers like people
out there squatting 800 pounds drug-free
and shit like that
is is that true are they really that
strong yes
yes they are
okay
some people
why because genetics
is king
genetics and time spent training add up
to the absolutely biggest explanatory
factor by a long shot
as to who is stronger and who is weaker
ray williams
well i don't know personally seems like
a nice guy
competed drug-free i don't know if he
still competes i haven't kept up with
the sport in the last few months
ray williams was probably drug free for
all all if not all if not or sorry some
if not all to my understanding all of
his unreal record-breaking attempts like
1100-pound squat or whatever the fuck
with no knee wraps
he was probably drug-free that's my best
assessment now i know some of you guys
[Music]
there are freaks out there in damn near
every part of the world
and
if you are not a freak
can you take drugs just loads of them
fuck it
to become an absolute monster in
strength
the answer is almost certainly not can
you become much stronger fuck yeah can
you become stronger than all the natties
which is like kind of like you would
think that's the case right like in jiu
jitsu you have this illusion that
as soon as you get promoted from white
belt to blue belt just because you have
a blue belt on you figure like well i
should be able to beat any white belt
bullshit tons of white blocks will
probably fuck you up
if you're a blue belt you get a purple
belt you should be like well i should
never lose to a blue belt because i have
a pro belt wrong the distribution of
abilities and thus victories and defeats
crosses all the belt levels
a few days back i got submitted in
training by a fucking purple belt i'm a
brown belt i'm fucking dr mike look at
all those muscles and shit like that i'm
supposed to know things
nobody told him motherfucker he just
dropped me like i wasn't even there
this shit is real and these delineations
between bluebell black belt blah blah
the statistical distributions overlap a
lot and the thing is the biggest
distribution in strength is one of
genetics and time spent training you
give me someone with unreal genetics and
they train for a long time
they're going to be stronger than almost
everyone who's on gobs and gobs of gear
sorry i know i wish there was a pill you
could take or a fucking injection you
could take that would make you stronger
than every natty so you could finally
have something to say for yourself it's
just not a thing and if you don't
believe me insert the do it meme there
like you know if i was taking as much
drugs as you i'd be as jacked and strong
do it then do it you'll be the first
enjoy right now here's the thing
i wish it was the case
i wish you could take a pill because i'm
i'm fucking
super pro pharmacology duh super pro
freedom i think people should be able to
take whatever they want i can't wait for
there to be a pharmaceutical
intervention that really increases
strength to like an obscene level that
just leaves genetics behind this is just
not a reality and steroids aren't the
thing to do it do they help a ton fuck
yeah if anyone's like you know there's
bullshit comments like
some guy like deadlifts 800 juiced to
the gills and like it's all hard work
chicken and broccoli shut the fuck up
clearly he's got a little extra special
help a lot of extra special help but a
lot it's like 10 to 15
it's not 25 it's not 50
i'll put it to you this way if you're an
adult and you've been training for more
than five years and you're benching
let's say you weigh like 180 and you're
benching 225 for sets of 10 or so
the nothing in this world you're gonna
be taking
all due probability 999 times out of a
thousand
that's gonna get you benching over 400
for reps
it's just not a thing high 200s sure
low 300s maybe
high 300s
400s
probably not very very rare
because strength is a motherfucker and
even if you expand your muscle size a
lot especially if you ratio her weight
class
the difference is unfortunately
not as exciting as you would think at
the end of the day here's the deal
do your best to get stronger plain and
simple don't worry about who's on what
or do
but you know it's fun to speculate and
all that shit derek moore plays more
dates kind of shit but don't worry about
oh but if i took this this and that
if you do choose to hop on and
intelligently and legally a not in a
cheating way use steroids to increase
your strength
my personal advice to you like real talk
like fucking bro to bro don't get your
hopes up too high
and at the worst case you'll be
pleasantly surprised
folks
thanks for tuning in see you next time
so steroids make you stronger but not by
a crazy margin however they do add a
crapload of muscle size how much based
on what check out this video let me know
what you think
