hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance prioritization today's ultra
nerdy topic my popular request
is to chat about the difference between
synchronous and asynchronous splits
which one is best for you so first let's
define them a synchronous split is
really short for weekly synchronous
microcycles
and what that means is each day of the
week monday tuesday wednesday etc
corresponds to a specific muscle group
training session focus
so for example just an example
monday could be chest and back
tuesday could be legs and arms wednesday
could be shoulders and forearms thursday
chest and back friday legs and arms
saturday shoulders and forums sunday is
rest day every single week and then the
next week you repeat that exactly same
muscle groups where you have them weekly
synchronous split
the asynchronous split
sort of implied in its name
short for weekly asynchronous
microcycles
is the microcycles of your training
the many rotations you go through all of
your muscle groups until you come back
around to train them again when they've
healed
is asynchronous to the weak it does not
line up with the weak
so what this means is is that that
rotation does not last seven days
thus successive weeks after week after
week can look quite different from one
another
for example
monday you do chest and back tuesday
legs and arms wednesday shoulders and
forearms sound similar right thursday
you take a rest day
and then you restart chest and back legs
and arms shoulders and forearms
monday is now a rest day tuesdays chest
and back etc now look at that tuesday
last tuesday was legs and arms this next
tuesday is chest and back
it's different
because it doesn't align on seven days
it's as simple as that
now
it's a simple change but it has a lot of
implications
so
here is my best comparison for you guys
the synchronous split has some
advantages
here they are
one so synchronous split is just you you
know mon every monday you do xyz
everyone's due to xyz
it makes scheduling really fucking easy
someone's like hey what are you training
thursday you know for sure because you
fucking have done that every thursday
for the last three months or so
next
it reduces surprises
like
oh shit today's leg day
fuck i should have packed more meals or
fuck i should have an xyz or i should
have got more sleep last night but if
you know every friday is your hard leg
day every thursday have a routine
there's no surprises you get extra sleep
extra
meanness and listen to demonic music
when you sleep and wake up ready to go
for likes
next point is
with the scheduling and the surprises
mixed together you can be better
prepared for example
every tuesday i take my belt and my
squat shoes to work with me because i
every tuesday i have a leg workout after
but if you have a leg workout sometimes
tuesday sometimes wednesday sometimes
thursday sometimes whenever you have to
have like a pop-up thing in your phone
that says hey take your belt and your
shoes and like yeah that's not super
inconvenient but it's one more thing to
think about whereas if you just get into
a habit into a pattern it makes
everything super easy
it can make weekends easy because
you can purposefully put either harder
sessions or easier sessions or no
sessions on weekends and then when
someone's like hey can you do you want
to come with us to northern california
wine country or two around it's gonna be
really fun we're going two saturdays
from now
okay you look at your calendar and
you're like okay it's nothing for work
nothing for family looks like i'm free
so what day is that my plan because if
you're asynchronous you're like oh fuck
that's legs
fuck
no i can't go i want to but
there's gonna be legs and actually
before you can get to that part you're
like what day is that when you run a
five-day asynchronous split and it's two
and a half weeks from now you got to be
like follow up let me write the shit
down it's fucking it's hard right
lastly
you know the gym hours at your gym and
you know you're not going to show up
early or too late or some shit like that
because with an asynchronous split
there's a lot of fucking balls in the
air at the same time be like leg day
fuck yeah 6 a.m show up and it's
saturday and the gym is not open until
8. you should have fucking known that
but you normally don't come and do legs
at 6 00 a.m on saturdays because you
were doing other stuff for it's rest day
or whatever there's no consistency which
is a big downside
now the asynchronous split has its own
advantages first it can allow your
muscles to recover almost exactly on
time for example if you have a monday
thursday leg session and a synchronous
split if you're a little too sore to
train on thursday or too sore to be
trained optimally
you don't want to throw off the rest of
your shit you either have to take a much
easier session which isn't super
productive or you have to just train
through soreness which isn't super
productive or as productive as it could
be
if you're on an asynchronous like it
either way you eat a dick right and not
the tasty kind
on an asynchronous split if thursday
your legs are not recovered
you just rest one more day you're not
gonna throw anything off your whole week
is already thrown off there's no fucking
rhyme or reason anything anyway you rest
one more day you heal up big time you
have a fucking great workout friday legs
and then you just push back all the
other days a little bit no big deal easy
fix
and
to that point
so there's a couple of ways in which you
can when you cover or you can align for
optimal recovery actually three
one is
you can reduce your rest days if needed
if you're recovered early you can go
early
the other which i just mentioned and is
actually point number two i said that
i'll fucked up is you can take an extra
rest day when needed or even a few and
you don't really fuck up the whole plan
you just restart the plan where it is
the other way though is by picking and
choosing when you train your muscles you
can make an asynchronous split that
really aligns with muscle recovery
especially for some muscles versus
others for example
you may note that if you really train
your hamstrings hard there's no fucking
way you can have two hard sessions in a
week as you just get too goddamn sore
and either you're doing like two sets of
leg curls and that's a hamstring workout
which is kind of weird or you are doing
you know five or six sets and then you
just can't recover and you're too sore
and you're too weak to do it again so
there may be no intelligent way to train
hamstrings twice a week for you but if
you're on a five-day rotation you can
train your hams hard every five days and
voila that's all good workouts so it can
align better to optimum recovery if that
really is something you want
now what is the right choice
first thing i'll say is at some point
advanced trainers are folks that think
of themselves as knowing stuff about
training and coaches and stuff like that
at some point you should try both for
years and years and years i ran a
five-day asynchronous split like
literally maybe five years or longer
maybe seven years
and i did something like chest shoulders
and arms on one day
legs on another day day after that day
three was back shoulders and arms again
because you know shoulders normally more
frequency and then i would rest two days
in a row and then i would repeat and it
was great i learned a ton it was awesome
most of your real world clients business
professionals moms etc human beings that
live in our world of seven days
um
the synchronous split just works much
better for schedule so i would say
asynchronous splits i would just almost
never program them to real-world clients
like if you have a doctor client
and you're like do you want an
asynchronous split that's going to be
tough now
in some situations asynchronous splits
are great and then they can be actually
called what's called a floating schedule
a floating schedule is an asynchronous
split
that a really busy person can do where
they can cluster their training closer
together or spread it out as needed so
let's say you are training a doctor but
it's not just a regular doctor he's a
really high level surgeon he's going to
have surgery scheduled and other times
of office work and other times of
downtime
you might say hey like how'd your week
go last week did you hear all your
sessions and he's like bro i was in five
surgeries i've hit fucking dick like
that sucks like i sort of tried to do
legs and then i did part of my chest
workout and i just didn't train and then
i don't even know what to do because
i finished all my surgeries friday night
saturday what saturday's typically a
rest day what the fuck am i supposed to
do you give them an asynchronous
floating schedule and you say look
here's you got upper days and lower days
upper lower upper lower if you hit more
than four days in a row take a rest day
or two because it was just too much
fatigue so let's say when he's free or
is in the office he goes up or lower
upper lower upper lower or sorry upper
lower upper lower
rest rest upper lower upper lower rest
rest
if there's a surgery coming up on
wednesday he can do monday tuesday upper
lower wednesday rest surgery takes the
whole fucking day thursday friday upper
lower again or push legs pull any one of
those can work as a floating schedule
asynchronous floating split where when
they're not busy they fucking either hit
it hard or rest up and when they're busy
they just don't show up to the gym that
works super well way better than a
weekly split but not a lot of people
fall into that category some abso
fucking lutely do and for them the
asynchronous split is fucking superior
but for most readable clients it's just
not going to work that a weekly schedule
is better
most advanced bodybuilders
when they're on you would think okay
advanced bodybuilders certainly on an
asynchronous split well they're not on
the floating split because bodybuilder's
job is to train so i can make all my
training sessions i don't need to
fucking do brain surgery so that goes
out the window asynchronous split just
have some advantages but most
bodybuilders seem to be on a weekly
synchronous split
uh and a lot of times instead of saying
oh i'm not healed yet i can just i need
to push my weak up and it's gonna fuck
everything up uh you can just take a
recovery session when you need a break
or go a bit easier that whole week or
something like that so there are many
fixes which take the optimality of an
asynchronous split difference to
optimality asynchronous split and it
closes the margins by such
a large
fraction that you can barely tell the
two apart like do i love the fact that
we have a seven day week no from a pure
programming perspective for spring
current splits i kind of wish we did an
eight day week but that's fucking weird
because the sun and moon phases don't do
that shit the whole calendar be fucked
up i know bodybuilding's more important
than the sun fuck the sun i agree flat
earth but um it's just not gonna happen
seven days a week is the way it's gonna
happen and we can do such a good job
with seven days a week that the all
those other benefits that i talked about
scheduling and consistency and
everything they really do outweigh in
most cases right
for many
of the folks
that are in a high level bodybuilding
their
cardio
it's per week their supplements it's per
week
travel is a constraining factor
a lot of times for them the synchronous
split just works better
right
for you it'll also probably the
synchronous split
but you should try an async split at
least once just to see how you like it
and if you are in a situation where you
get really busy periods of work or
something like that and then lots of
freedom and really busy periods or you
are someone that works kind of
stochastically like a police officer or
a firefighter like if you're a police
officer and you're a fucking shootout
all day you can't exactly hit legs
if that's something that happens
relatively often at your job
firefighters again excellent candidates
for floating splits it's the type of
asynchronous split in which
you're not saying i for sure have to
make it every three days to do legs but
you're saying ideally i would but if
that doesn't happen i can just push it
or pull it one way or the other
that's my big recommendation so most
people as weekly synchronous splits i
currently train a weekly synchronous
split i love it it's great i know when
all my dates are coming up i can time my
nutrition and my recovery everything
like that
but
when i travel i'll do an async split
because like some days you're just
walking around pick a dilly circus or
whatever kind of shit they have in
london and you know your legs are too
tired you're like should we do likes
today no that's fucking stupid let's
push it off you'll get access to a gym
or you'll be on a train going through
europe all the countries of europe and
uh sometimes you can really fucking
train and sometimes you can so a
floating synchronous split is really
good there
different rhymes different reasons so
mostly synchronous in some situations
floating asynchronous and if you really
really love it a consistent asynchronous
split if you just dedicated to telling
the world's calendar to go fuck itself
