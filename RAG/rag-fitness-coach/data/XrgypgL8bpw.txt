Interesting research by McLaughlin found that
during maximal bench press attempts, bar paths
differed between novices and elite lifters.
They both lowered the bar similarly, a slightly
curved diagonal line from above the shoulders
to the mid to lower chest region.
However, the novices lifted the bar straight
up initially, and then back over the shoulders.
Conversely, elite lifters pushed the bar back
initially, and then straight up.
This technique seems to be substantially more
efficient in helping you lift heavier loads,
likely because it makes the exercise easier
on the shoulders.
