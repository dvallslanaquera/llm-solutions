go almost all the way up almost all the
way up almost all the way up down
control
[Music]
youtube i'm dr mike this is jen aguirre
this is jared feather and we were
supposed to train jen's back which is
incredibly wide and awesome but she
shows up to me she's like i want to do
hamstrings and i want to do some quads
and we had a fist fight jared and i lost
okay so now uh this is why i'm facing
this way because my other side is all
beaten by that's why i have glasses on
and yeah jared can't even see any more
gen one and we're gonna do
some lower body training get ready
because she's known for many wonderful
things and one of them is kind of an
absolutely absurd posterior chain
oh okay she's already gonna show it off
now well i was gonna save the best for
last but whatever this is just pure
exhibitionism folks i swear to god we're
still a fitness channel tune in let's do
the first exercise
[Music]
all right folks exercise number one in
this hamstring plus quad day is going to
be stiff legged deadlifts done properly
now of course the potential question of
is it an rdo is an sldl
the real talk is the same movement the
two terms mean the same thing there are
variations in how you execute them like
the super upright super tight one can be
called an rdl the one that's a little
bit arms lower and your back isn't as
lordotic can be called the sldl but to
be completely honest it's the same thing
and then bodybuilding and i heard every
training it's always rdl because the
point is to target the hamstrings which
means we take a nice arch in the lower
back you can keep your chest up doesn't
matter a whole lot make sure your knees
never do this make sure they never
completely lock out you want to keep
them in that nice little middle zone and
then all of the movement occurs right at
the hip joint until you feel a painful
slow stretch at the bottom then you come
up standardization is the key
slow on the way down is the key that
mind muscle connection we're gonna do
multiple sets of probably five to ten
reps why not more reps in that percent
because with stiff legged deadlifts the
hamstrings tend to respond really well
to heavy loads and if you go super high
reps a lot of times your lower back and
upper back start to round over and get
tired and your hamstrings are like man
and then your back's like i'm done so
it's kind of like the wrong muscle is
fatigued first and then we don't
actually get close to failure for the
hamstrings which are the target muscle
so multiple sets we'll see would all
regulate we've never trained it before
two to four sets somewhere based on how
she's feeling when folks get to do this
exercise the rp way for the first time
they're like oh my god i can't move
after two sets usually so we're not
gonna do a ton and then after that we'll
be back with the next exercise let's get
it done
knees back hold
up
one last one
big chest the whole time
milk those hams slow
hold
up now put it on as if you're gonna do
another and put it down go to the ground

i feel like we're gonna need

definitely and then leg curls
[Music]

good tension on the hamstrings
barclays back hips back hips back bar

up
up
as if you're gonna do another
arch back chest off slow slow knees back
yes and down
good shit we'll take care all the way
forward felt better than the last set
good good stuff collect yourself get
hydrated and then we're gonna do leg
curls okay awesome pick up pieces of
yourself off the ground i'm up
hell yeah
[Music]
stiff legged deadlifts are done we ended
up doing three sets of five to ten reps
she was she had a tough time but an
awesome time
a lot of those cues about like holding
the knees back because when you
are doing a stuff like a deadlift your
body automatically naturally wants to
let the knees soften so you can use more
quad and actually propel the bar but
that's not the point the point is to
expose the hamstrings to tension and
then you have to keep the knees back a
little bit more so she's super fried but
big emphasis on hands we're switching to
leg curls her lower back is fried
leg curls now after stuff like a
deadlift accomplish two things one main
thing they train the hamstrings more and
give them more specific volume but
they're no longer limited by the lower
back which is kind of fried and
this lying leg curl gives the lower back
a decent break so that when she goes and
does some quad work after this we have
one more quad exercise after this she's
not limited by her lower back and the
quads again get an awesome exposure so
we get a really awesome two for one deal
here oh two to three sets probably here
on leg curls maybe two to four
now it sets of 10 to 20 because with leg
curls low reps etcetera it doesn't work
all that great usually the stimulus t
ratio it's just not that awesome again
focus on the eccentric full range of
motion let's get it done
right tap light tap
that one didn't count rest
oh there you go hold on that one didn't
count two more
good
one more
we'll get another one rest rest breathe
breathe relax finish one strong
there you go and slow
and that's it good
okay
here we go beautiful
a little faster on the way down there
you go
excellent just like that
don't slam off the bottom light tap
better yes
there it
is that too much
perfect
oh fuck yeah three more
question good
all the way
two
one more

fuck it
good stuff good stuff
[Music]
i'll get set jerry what's your smith
i like slander smiths always but it's up
to you yeah i know for special choices
i'm not looking forward to this
[Music]
two awesome hamstring exercises
because the last one was lying leg curls
not really any lower back involvement
jen should be ready to finish off her
quads
the way her week is structured and we
sort of fit our workout with her on
youtube into that structure
is she has some emphasis days where
quads and hams and glutes get trained
throughout the week multiple times
but sometimes it's a lot of glue a lot
of ham a little quad and so on and so
forth with the other like sometimes a
lot of quality other way around today
it's a lot of hamstring sort of minimum
glute which the stiff legged develop
gets and just a bit of quads so we're
going to do three or four sets of smith
machine squats
feet
nice and far out super upright to hit
the quads again this also provides a
little bit of glute volume the
hamstrings are super tired but this
exercise really just takes them
completely out of the equation it's a
great movement probably sets of
five to 15 reps
probably not a whole lot of maya reps
because once the bar is on your back
with these the timer's ticking and your
energy is draining so you just got to
get it get it in get it done
multiple sets let's finish this workout
stronger support
at the bottom big area
up
keep going you're a fucking warrior keep

so
when we started the workout
after a set of stuff like a deadlifts
jen was breathing really hard she was
like
oh man that was tough and i was like
yeah feel free to sit down lay down
whatever you have to do to get rested
she's like she looks at me with this
laser look and she's like i don't sit
down
i'm not sitting down why not because i
just don't do that during workouts and i
was like okay that's what's up and i was
like jerry and i are like i bet she's
going to be sitting down at the end of
this shit and look at what you know we
have to make that left motherfucker sit
on down sit down
sit down so three hard sets of smith
machine squats
about
10 reps per set on average so at age 12.
one last set we lower the weight
significantly
she's going to do mini cluster sets
of
four reps with no lockout at the top and
then at every fourth she rests locks out
takes a couple breaths and goes again
unreal metabolite shit try it yourself
be safe good technique at all times
baseline is always good technique on top
of that we layer the effort the ground
is good technique
the tree of effort grows from it there's
nothing without good technique give it a
shot at home hopefully jen survives this
stay tuned
down let's go
quads come on is that okay yes
come up a little higher
and again good
and lock out
rest rescue
