hey folks dr mike is here for rp
plus rpu renaissance periodization and
the emotion of anger
which is typified by the miniature
dachshund as an animal
if you ever need a miniature dachshund
don't assume you can just pet them
because sometimes they get snappy
just like that they bear the teeth scary
luckily we're not talking about nature
toxins we are doing hypertrophy
advanced concept and tools lecture
number nine
progression within a mesocycle specific
instructions
and theoretical directions as to how to
progress within a mesocycle
for muscle growth so first we're going
to talk about why we're interested in
progression at all in such a level of
detail
the purpose of a progression which is
oftentimes forgotten or confused
talk about which variables we're going
to progress in that we're going to
address all three
progression variables implications for
training and programming recommendations
why are we interested in the details of
a progression
well uh let's say we have the perfect
workout
it's only perfect once because the human
body adapts and even after
uh you know any given stimulus is
presented our physiology changes
even if it's just a little right so
for the next session to be as close to
optimal as possible we probably have to
change some things
a lot of times it means doing more it's
not indefinite because we have to have
deloads and so on and so forth but a
little bit more of something
makes sure that we're on track to still
get the best and the best and best
possible stimulus
right if we undershoot this idea of more
and just do way less than we have to
then we just leave gains on the table
like you've just been from weeks and
weeks training way easier than you
should have been
if we overshoot more it's cool we might
get some good gains but we accumulate so
much fatigue so
fast that our med cycle ends up being
really short we have to deal with super
often it's not the best use of our time
it's also a little bit risky for injury
um and if we progress on the wrong
variable
we'll make it some optimal gains for
example uh just real quick and this gets
a little technical but most of you folks
are up to speed on this
if you only ever add sets but you never
add reps or weight
the reps in reserve for all the sets
starts to go up and up and up
to where you're doing like 20 sets with
10 rir by the end of your mesocycle
it's just like a fundamentally crappy
stimulus to fatigue ratio because you're
doing all this work for
not much growth whatsoever relative to
how much work you're doing so
how you progress not just that you
progress is also important
so the purpose of a progression
what's the point of regression it's uh
to have good training
what is good training good training
stimulates the most growth that we can
per session which is good per session
but it isn't so much training
that the next session won't be possible
so there's really a two-factor
analysis that we have to apply to how do
we have a great session
does it check the box for growing muscle
today yes
and does it set us up in such a way that
we can grow muscle in the next session
as well
okay in all sessions but the last one of
the mesocycle
or last of the accumulation phase which
is who cares we have deload
have to ask both questions because you
can honestly say like how do you get the
most growth in one session you choose
just as much as you sort of can
uh close to recover from you right to
your maximum adaptive volume
just a little bit over even for an
overreaching effect the problem is you
can't sustainably do that
multiple sessions in a row we don't it's
almost like this
if you're gaining weight and you have to
plan out all six meals and it's really
all six meals are really pretty big
you have to eat just enough food in
every single meal to really challenge
yourself really get full but be just
hungry enough for the next meal to still
be able to eat it
like if you double the food in the first
meal you'll
have to skip your second meal and then
you'll have to eat double again
then you'll almost certainly not be able
to do that and you're really behind
and by the time you get to the evening
you're supposed to just have one meal
you're behind like three meals or
something like that
it's just not sustainable you have to
give up on your plan right same kind of
idea
if you start with too much volume or too
much load or too many reps
um another problem is you get probably
too much damage
to get your best growth because you're
now you're above your maximum adaptive
volume
and you might only be able to do like
one or two more sessions before you have
to deload
what kind of hypertrophy program is that
we do two hard workouts and then a dlo
two hard workouts and then deal that's
kind of crazy
you know you're essentially deloading a
third of the year if you look at it that
way
not the best way to grow muscle in most
cases on the other hand you could say i
want to play it really easy and you
start with
very little volume load and reps
then you know it's under stimulative my
long shot you're just not growing much
muscle if at
all and if you say okay damn it i
undershot
let me get into the volume that's going
to be really stimulative you have to
make a big jump
right and big jumps are risky from an
injury perspective so
we have every sort of incentive to make
sure
that we get our progression well so we
can slowly ease in and all the time look
more and more of our program until the
fatigue is too high we deload and then
we repeat
right so we could say that training in
week one of a program
gives us good acute growth stimulus
and we're also able it gives us enough
volume and intensity and
sorry enough volume and load and reps to
give us a good acute growth stimulus and
enough of all those things but not so
many so that we can continue to progress
for another
old three to six weeks from here
without prohibitive fatigue accumulation
cutting off our progress
right uh a easy analogy to this in
addition to the eating food analogy
is um how fast should a marathon runner
run the first mile of the 26.2 miles of
his race um
fast enough to stay on pace uh to meet
his
uh timelines that he wants to sort beat
everyone right that's the equivalent of
a good acute growth stimulus right check
mark that i'm running fast enough to get
good results in the race but not so
because if you say that you could just
run real fast
you could start sprinting or shit you'll
be way ahead of a pack
but the consideration is and slow enough
so that i can go 26.2 miles without a
prohibitive amount of fatigue
accumulation and just falling over same
idea
and you know people say you know uh
training is a sprint life is a sprint
not a marathon like
there's some wisdom to that right
hypertrophy training is uh
not a sprint it is a marathon and weeks
and weeks and weeks of training
any one training session can't be so
crazy as to prohibit all the others
right
if we take a bit of an algebraic
mathematical approach we can say you
know
training in week one was the first one
on the slide what about training in week
n minus x holy shit math i didn't sign
up for this you sure as hell did this is
rp plus
all right we're some brainy
motherfuckers in here so n
is the total uh number of weeks in
accumulation
right so let's say eight uh we're
planning on eight weeks of accumulation
uh before deload week and then x is the
remaining weeks we have left in
accumulation
right so n minus x would be like let's
say it's
eight minus six so that basically means
we're at week number two
so training in week two is good acute
growth stimulus for that week okay we
have to make sure we check that box
and can continue to progress for another
x
weeks in that case six weeks right from
here without prohibitive fatigue
accumulation
because you can always turn up the
volume and be like well i can survive
another week like this but who cares
you're trying to survive for eight
right it doesn't make sense to go balls
to the wall and have to deal it all the
time
right from this situation
we know that if we start to hit very low
reps in reserve or go to failure
we fatigue spikes like crazy and we
probably have to deal with the next week
so we can surmise that reps in reserve
will usually either stay stable or
fall on any given week in most weeks of
training
right uh rer reductions cause growth
every time you let do less rar
for that session closer to failure you
cause more hypertrophy
but they also sap sustainability which
is okay if you're in the last week so
basically
you start a messa cycle at three or four
reps in reserve
and as you progress through the
metacycle your reps in reserve go down
to
zero or one and then you deal and repeat
right so how many reps in reserve should
be shooting for
two weeks out of the last well you know
rir 2 orio 1 something like that
if you're at four reps in reserve and
you're two weeks until you're done with
your program
you've just been undershooting like
crazy right and if you are going to
failure and you have three weeks left of
your program how are you supposed to
manage an overload with such an
unbelievable amount of cumulative
fatigue you won't be able to do
right so we can say rar usually fall as
most weeks of training go so we can
simplify all this
and condense it to say the purpose of
progression is to hit enough volume to
meet the growth needs for this session
but stay shy enough of mrv to continue
progression on track
and hit the target reps in reserve
for that week and in most weeks it's
either going to be stable
or decline it's never going to go up
okay and imagine week one
you had three rir week two you hit four
rar like where are you gonna use is it
gonna go easy and easy and easier until
you quit training of course not
right so you gotta either decline an rar
or
either stay stable sometimes okay so
that is the purpose of progression
by purpose of progression we mean that's
the goal we want as folks that are
training ourselves
i want to hit enough volume to meet
growth needs but make sure we're pretty
far from
mrv concomitantly far from mrv as we get
uh
further and further away from the last
week of our training cycle so as we
close our train cycle
make it closer and closer to mrv and
also every single one of those weeks we
want to hit approximately the ir
that is the target anywhere between
three or four hours we start
and zero or one hour when we end so as
we go let's say every two weeks then we
say you know
r3 for two weeks r2 for two weeks rer1
for two weeks r0 for a week and then
that ends that's like a seven week
accumulation
or it's just one week at a time and it's
a four week accumulation something like
that the details
not overly important now we know that's
the purpose of progression
which variables do we change okay so
again super quick review
hit enough volume to meet growth needs
for the session stay shy enough for mrv
to continue the progression as planned
and hit target rir
the volume is easy because we just do
that through sets
so when it says hit enough volume which
means growth needs number of sets
and we're going to titrate our number of
sets we'll have a formula for it later
an algorithm
what about uh hitting the r well we can
hit our ir
either through progressing in load or
progressing in repetitions in other
words
adding weight to the bar or adding reps
to the bar
when our load and rep additions
appropriate we're going to zoom in a
little bit and
talk about some specific times where one
is better than the other generally
speaking as long as you're doing hard
sets that is
as long you're hitting the reps in
reserve that you need there's very
little difference in all likelihood
between progressing by load and
progressing by reps
so one versus the other they're both
great tools sometimes one is better than
the other we'll get to that in just a
sec
we'll start with progressions in load
here's the deal why do we progress and
load again it's to hit the rs
that's it right if you don't add
something
rir will go up or stall for too long for
example
let's say you do a set of 10 with 100
kilos in the squat or something like
that whatever actually i set a 10 100
kilos in week one
at three reps in reserve so you could
have done 13 reps right
if you do the same set of 10 at 100
kilos in week two
you got stronger your work capacity
improved your neurology improved so all
of a sudden now it's a four rep and
reserved set
you're up to 14 reps potentially if you
wanted to that's not good
that is not an increase in stimulus that
it's a decrease in stimulus it's going
the wrong way that's further away from
optimal training
right so ideally we should be aiming for
at least three rir in that next week and
possibly even two ir
so how do we mitigate that well instead
of doing 100 kilos that second week we
go to 102.5 kilos
right and then same we hit it for 10
right and then that's a three ri r or we
can even go to 105 kilos in the second
week and that's a two
ir perfect either way depending on if we
want a longer shorter accumulation which
is just some
you know pluses and minuses to both
we're uh
basically uh one of those is uh
they're both totally cool and they're
both
meeting that uh check mark of at least
our stable
probably rnr's follow right super super
good stuff and
for hitting target rars load additions
are excellent
they're super excellent um in some
senses they're mandatory
so remember that our bottom end of the
hypertrophy stimulus range
is uh our overload range is probably 30
or so one rep max so you could say you
know i'm never going to add
any weight i'm always going to add reps
until you're doing reps of 30 plus
every set then it's probably too late
then you have to add weight so they're
mandatory
when load is at thirty percent one round
or lower for example on laptops you do a
hundred pounds for a set of thirty
next week you're not going to do a set
of thirty one or thirty two you're gonna
do
more maybe 110 pounds for a set of 26 or
something like that right
something more challenging that brings
you back into that range
also they're highly recommended but not
mandatory if in your case repetitions
would leave the target rep range away so
for example
you are trying to work in the 15 to 20
rep range on purpose for a certain
exercise
and you reach 20 reps in that exercise
because you've been adding reps
next week you have to add something do
you add a rep and go to 21 reps well
that's not in the 15 to 20 range anymore
so you probably want to add weight to
the bar to keep that in the 15 to 20
range an even better way
to stay in the 15 to 20 range if you can
is to never add weight at all
is to do like 17 reps on the first set
okay and then add weight every single
week by a little bit to just stay at 17
reps and have an hour
fall that's awesome because you're
getting right in the middle of that
range exactly how you want
um that being said
there's a very good chance that weight
additions are not magically better than
repetitions
um there's going to be a study that
some colleagues and i are executing
together a formal university study
that's going to address
if we can find a difference between reps
and
weight progression on hypertrophy but
all of the
indirect literature we have so far so
it's almost certainly not going to find
anything
um so people seem to think there's this
kind of like a lot of
um our practices and bodybuilding and
hypertrophy training are sort of
inherited from weightlifting and
powerlifting
and they're adding weight is better than
adding reps because the point is to get
stronger
as much weight as you can nobody gives a
shit how many you know sets of 10 you
did in the squat they care what your
squat max is they care what your cleaner
jerk max is
so we've sort of inherited that and
people think oh adding weight's good
anyway it's good it is good but adding
reps within a certain range in the 5 to
30 rep range
is probably just as good right so
there's no magic
um however on the downside of
progressing in loads sometimes
it's problematic to add load let's say
you have a 10 pound dumbbell and the
next
dumbbell up is 15 pounds you're doing
side laterals and you're doing sets of
10 to 20.
let's say you're going from you know
you've done a set of
uh 12 in side laterals with a 10
pounders
do you use the 15 pounders next week are
you crazy you'll do a set of four
that's way out of your rep range it's
probably dangerous for your shoulder
joints to be lifting that heavy and
isolation movement
so sometimes the weight jumps are so big
wrap jumps are the only way to go
so you might do the tens for 12 and then
13 and then 14 and a 50 and then deload
and then go 16 17 18 19 20.
and then finally when you're doing the
tens for like sets of 20 or multiple
sets above 15 reps like
21 17 15 15 14
stuff like that then you go to the 15s
and start hitting you know
10 11 reps with them something like that
and then start
again adding reps to work up through
that range right so that's definitely a
possibility
progression and load is not a religion
we're following it's just a good
progression tool
progressing in reps is the other option
right
same idea here so i'm not going to
belabor these points you can read them
if you want to pause this lecture
um if you don't add something rar styles
it goes up so if you do a set of 10 with
100 kilos
in week one a 3r the same uh same set of
10 again is just four ir it's not really
good
but if you add reps uh you can lower the
rar
or keep it stable so for example if you
do 100 kilos instead of for 10 you do it
for 11 next week that's
same rir so it's good stable or you can
even lower to ir if you do something
like 12 reps so it's really good
uh repetitions are excellent for hitting
rars so
in almost every way as good as weight
additions with some exceptions
when dumbbell weights and other weights
jump by really big fractions sometimes
even the pull down or the triceps push
down
the plates are like 10 pounds at a time
and if you're like doing push-downs with
50 pounds
jumping to 60 is the equivalent of like
doing 500 pounds of squat one week and
then going to 600 the next week that's
kind of insane right so
a bunch of different machines and
dumbbells especially have a situation
where
uh rep additions are almost mandatory
because weight additions would throw you
way outside of your rep range right
um repetitions are prohibitive
in sets of 30 plus reps like just like
we mentioned if you go above 30 reps in
a set
adding reps is just doing more work it's
probably not stimulating any more
hypertrophy
and uh they're definitely have their
limitations when you're crossing rep
ranges like we mentioned
you know if you're said you're going to
do the 10 to 20 range but now you're
doing
the sets of 21 22 23 you're really just
not doing what you said you were
it's time to add load um and the one
caveat here about rep
additions is you can really get into
them and it starts to be really awesome
and you can say man like you know i can
just keep the weight the same and add
the wraps it gives me confidence i don't
have to like
strain my tissues as much i think this
is a really good way to train i can milk
it out i can really get
sort of used to lifting one weight for a
long time get to build a bunch of work
capacity it's
a safe way to do that and build a bunch
of volume
and all of a sudden like when i increase
the load later i can sort of go through
that process again
it's totally cool except you remember
that sometimes especially when reps are
very low
uh repetitions are way way more powerful
way bigger fractions of the total
workload than weight additions or the
load editions
and it can get you into some trouble
with fatigue accumulation and injury
risk for example
if you're squatting 480 pounds for like
say sets of uh
six or something like that right um then
your 480 uh you do 485 the next week
that's uh 1.01 times the volume
very very tiny progression super
manageable like if you did 480
for six uh in a leg press next week
someone said
you know you recovered pretty well so do
you think you could do 485 for six or
for seven you're like
or rather for six again and be like yeah
jesus christ i might not even notice
that weight increase right
unless unless fatigue accumulation is
really crazy high
or i was pushing all the way to failure
i should almost certainly be able to get
that no problem on the other hand
let's say you know you heard somewhere
in rp plus their rep and weight
progressions are almost equivalent he
said okay instead i'm going to do 480
and instead of going to 485 and at 480
i'm gonna go from six reps to seven reps
okay add a rep it's just you're like
well whatever add five pounds or rather
up okay same thing uh
that is an increase in 1.16 times the
volume that is 16 times the volume
increase
by adding a rep then by adding five
pounds on the bar for weight
16 times so what you're saying is if you
successfully add
from six reps to 10 reps in a mesocycle
with 480 pounds
and someone goes from 480 to 495 or
something
and they're like i did great you did way
better than them but you also put
yourself at much higher risk
but this way if someone goes from 480 to
495 for sets of six and leg press call
let me impress that's good progress
someone goes from set to six it sets a
10 in the leg press at 480. holy crap
that's a different lifter those are
different size quads
because every single jump was basically
16 times the magnitude of the weight
jump if they jump by reps
be careful jumping by reps so if it
works it works
just have some um reference for it
understand that with low rep sets
jumping wire ups is a big
task going up by a rep when sets are
between 5 and 10 and even 5 and 15 reps
is a thing when you start jumping on
reps between sets of 15 instead of 25
it's really kind of equivalent to
jumping by weight and sometimes when you
jump by reps from 25 to 30
the rep increments can be even smaller
than weight increments especially based
on how much weight you're lifting which
can have an advantage right so just keep
all that in mind
all right those are pretty easy
progressions now
progressing in sets a little bit more
complicated but as we'll see it filters
down to something that's not
super over the top when you start a
missile cycle you probably want to start
right around your minimum effective
volume we already figured out how to
start manufacture volume in the last
lecture but a quick review is did the
session give you a palm
did you feel like you had to make a
challenging effort and did the session
make you soar
and you can rank these on a zero to two
point scale so like no pump at all is
zero points
okay pump is one point great pump is two
points same idea for
uh session effort and for soreness add
all these numbers together this is the
exact algorithm you can use it's a great
one
if you totaled zero to one then you're
under your minimum effective volume you
should probably be doing more volume by
a little bit
if you totaled in this uh in the system
in this algorithm if you totaled between
two and four points
then you're probably around your mev
you're pretty close and if you went five
or six
then you're probably over your mev how
do you go five or six let's imagine what
six is six
means you score a two point on every
single one of these that means you got a
great pump
you felt like it was a ton of work and
you got sore for a few days or
more that's not mev that's over mev for
most people right does that make sense
so if you look at this it makes a ton of
sense get to your mev
and then we have another whole algorithm
the rp patented set progression it's
going to be in the rp
hypertrophy book and here it is
it asks you two questions and there's a
one to four ranking scale for each one
and then you analyze the results after
so you hit your mev
and you're asking the question of how do
i progress how do i add sets from here
do i add sets from here right so in the
second week
you alter your training via this
algorithm question
for the first session that you did how
sore did you get
first answer is you get sword all second
answer is you got stiff for a few hours
or whatever maybe a bit sore but by the
next day you were healed
way in advance of your session for that
muscle group number three
is you got to lay outside muscle
soreness but it healed just on time for
your next session
so you weren't sore when you were trying
to train and number four is you got doms
and it wasn't healed and you had to
train when you were sore
in the next session okay and then what
about performance
number one option is you hit your target
reps
two rer or more above what was planned
for that week or you had to do two more
extra reps
to match planned rar what does that mean
that means
let's say you were trying to hit a set
of 10 you hit a set of 10 last week
and you increased the weight by five
pounds and you're like i bought a set of
10 should put me at the same r
except instead of that happening you hit
a set of 10 and you were supposed to hit
2 ir let's say or three rar and it was
legit five rer you were like oh okay
that was too easy
and then the next set you're like i'm
gonna push as many reps as i need to to
get to the the three rar that i want
and you end up doing 12 reps instead of
10 right
that is way way easy your performance
has
elevated significantly from last week
okay
so keep that in mind option number two
is
um you basically hit uh right around
the performance that you are expecting
so you hit your target reps at rir
planned
or one above maybe it was a little bit
better or you just do no extra reps to
hit your target rar or maybe just one
extra rep so like
you did a hundred pounds last week now
you're doing 105 you did 12 reps last
week at rar3
this week you hit uh rar3 but it was
like 12 reps or 13 reps or something so
pretty close to matching performance
um and then number three is uh you hit
your target reps but the reps in reserve
were a bit lower than expected so we
can't say this is a reduction in
performance because it's technically not
but we suspect we're getting damn close
to one so for example
you know 100 pounds for 10 reps last
week 105 pounds this week you're
expecting 10 reps
you hit 2 rir last week this week to get
those 10 reps you had to go
one rar so you're like uh okay i thought
it was going to be two r
or let's say you were expecting one rar
you actually have to go to failure
zero r to hit all those ten reps
technically you're not underperforming
because you still match your performance
but you're damn close so we're going to
have something to say about that in a
second
number four is real straightforward
that's our little mrv detector you
couldn't match your last week's reps
no matter what rar you did right we did
a hundred pounds for 10 reps last week
this week you did 105 for six okay you
just shit the bad right and this wasn't
six because you stopped four hours short
it was six because you went to failure
and you did six and that's all you could
do
right all right so here's where the
algorithm
we asked ourselves these questions
they're pretty straightforward not a ton
of wiggle room here
if you get a one on both so you didn't
get sore at all
and your performance was excellent
exceptional you probably add something
like two to three sets to that session
next week
like imagine doing uh three sets of
chest press you get
literally just no soreness at all and
the next week on chest press you were
like
i could do this forever right then your
volume in that last session was probably
just not a lot
and in that next session you should
probably add some volume
uh and it's probably a really good idea
so basically what ends up happening is
you add two or three sets you do three
sets of chest press maybe you go up to
five right you could go to four but that
could still not be enough because you
were so
way ahead of the curve chances are
you're so under stimulated it's okay to
add a bit more sets than usual
you're not going to score a lot of ones
on both sometimes it'll usually be like
ones or two so
if you do a one or two or a two on both
that means you're doing really well and
you're certainly recovering on time
but you're recovering on pace we want to
progress in sets so we just add like one
set to the next session for example
so you do four sets of of chest press
last time
you know you get a little bit sore or
not sore but you know performance this
time
or the next chest exercise you did uh
sorry next chest workout you did
you know your performance was good but
not uh you're not amazing uh
it's just like you hit all your numbers
but you know if you push it harder you
would be really fatigued
it's okay i'm going to add one set i
think i'm going to be able to adapt at
that speed and
gain hypertrophy there if you get a
three
on performance okay at all
uh or a three or four on soreness at all
uh then you don't want to add sets for
the next week so three on performance
remember is like you hit your target
reps but you i had a lower aria than
expected so you sort of
were like oh i mean i got the work done
but damn like i had to push it harder
than i thought
clearly that amount of volume from last
week
uh was already like close to where you
could recover from
adding any would be stupid because you'd
probably exceed your mrv so you're just
going to keep your volume the same
eight sets of chest fucked you up pretty
well last week so that this week you
barely got the work in
just do eight sets of chests this week
don't don't get napoleonic and try to go
too far
and then three or four on soreness means
like if you just recursive for example
you did eight sets of chest
and by the next workout for you know an
incline bench where you did flat you got
eight sets of flat bench
eight sets of incline bench a couple
days later you just
barely recover from soreness don't go up
in volume
you just barely covered let's do okay
let's
check that okay it's good we're gonna
keep this volume if our soreness
really is much easier next week then we
can start to add volume but if you're
just barely recovering
don't assume that you can just add
volume and be totally good right not not
a really good idea
and if it's a four which means there was
overlapping soreness that doesn't mean
we have to go back and reduce volume
like crazy but we certainly can't add
any volume
now easy one is foreign performance if
you get a foreign performance
especially two sessions in a row you
need some kind of volume reduction
you need a recovery session recovery
half week a deload something
because you are by definition over your
mrv
pause this video take a real deep look
through this algorithm
once the rp hypertrophy book comes out
in 2020
maybe if you watch this it's 30 20 20 um
then
you're going to see that and it's going
to be very very well explained
this is a really really awesome way to
program training
because it really just mathematically
tells you when to go up one to go down
based on your body's responses pretty
neat pretty neat
if all this sounds really complicated
you're like oh my god algorithms math
fuck that i don't want to do a rating
scale every time
we're going to super simplify it for you
if you're recovering ahead of schedule
like you're not as sorry as you thought
your performance is super awesome add
sets
if you are covering on schedules you're
just recovering from soreness pretty
well but not you know
just a day or two in advance of where
you're supposed to be
and if your performance is on track but
not crazy then
um you probably just don't add sets you
keep it as it is because this is really
really good training but close to your
limits so you don't want to push the
boundaries you add reps you have weight
to get to your rers but you don't add
sets and if you're under recovering and
you're not performing to
where you need to be then you probably
need to take a recovery session recovery
half week or deload
to reduce all that fatigue and then
slowly start building back up from there
right as far as implications from
training here it is first of all you
don't progress for no reason
right you progress to keep the sessions
as stimulative as possible
in the context of knowing that your
accumulation length needs to be a decent
length and you can't take
too much too soon okay great sessions
with a little bit of an eye for the
future
to have future great sessions as well
that's the purpose of progression
right so if the sessions are too easy
for their time in the meso then you
probably add
load or reps or sets or all of them to
make them more difficult
if they're a bit too hard you stop
adding so that your body's adaptations
can catch up and the
workload can be sustainable again and if
they're way too hard where you can't
perform them
you back off you reduce fatigue take
some recovery days and then you restart
the progression from there
quick example here last slide for
programming
recommendations there's just a sample
progression pause the video on your own
time and just look through this because
i
i can explain some of this but it's
really kind of apparent you just need to
like sort of look at it for a little bit
so for example
this i think illustrates every kind of
progression we talked about
we got uh week one week two week three
and this that doesn't mean we end at
week three just
just a sample here we got two sessions
so for barbell row for the top exercise
first exercise in this
two sessions look at the sets we have
week one we have two sets
week three you have three sets week uh
sorry week two we have three sets
we three we have four cents so we're
going up in sets let's see what's
happening with weight 185 pounds
in the first week 190 on the second week
195 in the third cool just a sample that
doesn't mean you go up by five
you do the analysis and see how much you
need to go by to hit my irs right
and there's the rs we go rar3 rar2 r1
sounds really good and then what about
the reps in this case because
we're increasing the weight and the sets
seemingly we're hitting the rars we want
without having to progress in reps for
the first two weeks so it's eight and
seven reps
then it's eight seven six right just
matching which is super great and then
the last week let's say it's week three
let's say we deload after
we can do 976 because we want that ri r1
right it's all about hitting those
target rars is really really important
and then we have on the next example is
a giant set of pull-ups
the g means as many as many sets as it
takes
to get however many reps we want so we
have
a weight of uh what was it oop that's a
typo
um the weight says three it should be
zero right so
zero weight zero weight zero weight
every single time we're not adding uh
any weight to our body we're just doing
pull-ups
uh we are doing 30 reps total on the
first
week 35 reps total on the second week 40
reps total on the last week
and there are reps and reserves two and
two and two so we're just doing uh as
many sets as it takes to get two reps in
reserve every single time
adding them up and and getting all that
together
and then let's see what a good one is ah
here's the last example i'll do and then
you can look at session two by yourself
pull downs last exercise on session one
the sets go two sets two sets three sets
so that's to reflect that we don't
always increase on sets right
auto regulation and the weight here
stays the same every single time 110
pounds 110 pounds 110 pounds
remember i said that sometimes the plate
stacks 110 to 120 is a big distance
sometimes
would really throw off your reps so what
do you do here instead of increasing the
weight
in order to keep the there's r here is
two then one then zero so something's
getting harder
right what are we doing well the reps
are 25 and 15 in the first week
26 and 16 in the second week then 27 17
and 14 in that last week
meaning we're adding reps take a look at
the other examples here
it's not rocket science it's just about
making things a little bit harder a
little bit harder a little bit harder
to do two things make our workouts good
every single time we step in the gym
and restrain ourselves enough so that we
can have future good workouts
later in the mesocycle folks see you
next time
our next lecture in advanced hypertrophy
concepts will be
the stimulus to fatigue ratio
spooky it's close to halloween we're
recording this so everything is a spooky
theme
folks see you later
