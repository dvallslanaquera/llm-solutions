you know six or seven sets on the leg
press six or seven sets on the hack
squat six or seven sets on the high bar
Squat and the Smith machine and boom
that's all your quads need and they
can't do anymore or they fail to recover
completely on average if your mrv really
is 20 you'll probably see some of your
best gains between 16 and 18 working
cents per week why 80 to 90% now is
there an argument that 80 to 90% is
something I pulled literally out of my
 absolutely could it be in some
cases 70 to 80% yeah could in some cases
it be 90 to 90 5% yeah also also yes but
we can be sure it's not two things one
set per week and a sure isn't 20
not every week because you will not be
able to recover week in and week out
sure shit's not 21 either that's for
sure not the case SC guy she's not 21
run oh was 18 the legal limit or some
 right not that you know anything
about that no sir oh boy I stay away
from all that
