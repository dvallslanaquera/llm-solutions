so if you're planning a fat loss phase
or you're in the middle of one right now
make sure to follow those guidelines
once you've hit your fat loss goal it's
so easy to screw this up and just flush
weeks and months of effort straight down
the drain
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to talk about a
scenario that i find
very sad and depressing to watch unfold
it's something that i've seen happen
oh roughly 4 million times over the
years and it's a fat loss mistake that a
very high percentage of people make but
hopefully by watching this video you
will not be
one of them and the tragic fat loss
mistake that i'm talking about today is
this
it's the person who makes the commitment
to lose body fat and get into better
shape
they overhaul their previous lifestyle
clean up their diet put in the work in
the gym
stay consistent track their progress and
ultimately get the result that they were
after
so far so good but the tragic part is
that because they don't know how to
handle the period of time
after they've reached their initial body
fat goal they just end up reverting back
in the other direction
and this can happen very quickly or it
can creep up very slowly over time but
in any case
because they don't have a proper post
cutting plan in place
they end up erasing either a good
portion of what they achieved or
potentially all of what they achieved
and in some more extreme cases
they might end up even worse off than
they were at the very start and this is
very depressing for obvious reasons
because all that hard work just gets
flushed down the toilet and it's also a
really discouraging thing to go through
as well
and this applies both to general fitness
beginners you know just overweight
individuals
who are looking to drop a larger amount
of body fat but it also applies to more
experienced trainees as well
those who are just doing a typical
cutting phase and trying to achieve a
leaner physique
in general now why does this happen and
what can you do to make sure that it
doesn't happen to you
well i'm going to go over a few
important points here and i'd strongly
suggest watching this all the way
through
because it could very well make the
difference between success and failure
with your fat loss program
over the long term so first off is just
sort of a general overall mindset factor
that you really need to understand and
accept
going in and that is that the same
general habits that you followed
to lose the fat those are going to be
the same general habits that you'll need
to continue following
in order to maintain your results over
the long term this is not about putting
in the work
getting the result and then just letting
loose and going back to what you were
doing before
if you want to have a lean strong
muscular healthy body
this is something you're going to be
doing for life okay yes once you've lost
the fat
then the calorie deficit ends so you
will be able to
increase your food intake and go back to
your maintenance calories and the
potential side effects
associated with that calorie deficit
will gradually subside
but the general overarching habits those
never end so basing your diet
primarily around nutrient rich less
calorie dense whole foods
moderating your overall calorie intake
you can definitely still have your treat
foods and your treat meals here and
there
but you are going to have to moderate it
you need to make sure you're getting in
enough protein
that your training program is consistent
and on point this stuff never ends it's
a new way of living that you're
permanently adopting
you're not going on a diet and then
going off it later on this is not some
kind of 12-week program
it's not a temporary fat loss boot camp
so
really hammer that into your mind that
you're fundamentally changing
your overall lifestyle on a permanent
basis and if you're not prepared to do
that
then you're just not ready for this in
general and there's a very good chance
that even if you do lose some fat or
even all of the fat that you were aiming
for
you'll probably still fail and fall off
track with this in the longer term
now to get a bit more specific and
practical the key thing here is that you
need to know how to navigate
that initial post cutting period there's
a sort of sensitive time frame that
happens right after you've reached your
desired level
of leanness that can really make or
break you moving forward and it's a
sensitive period because
you've been in an ongoing calorie
deficit and as a result of that
your metabolism is going to be down
regulated to a certain degree
so hormones that regulate hunger and
energy and fat loss
like leptin testosterone t3 those will
all decrease to some extent
and so your maintenance calories are
going to be lower than they were at the
start of your cut
on top of that your cravings and your
appetite are also going to be at their
highest
the intensity of that will depend on how
long you're in a deficit for
how big the deficit was and also just
how lean you are now
in addition to that you're also going to
have lower levels of non-exercise
activity thermogenesis or neat for short
meaning your body will just be
naturally moving around less throughout
the day which is a natural response that
your body
employs to conserve energy so you'll be
burning fewer calories from that
and since you've put in all that hard
work and you've accomplished what you
were after
mentally you're also going to be in a
position where it'll be very easy to
just justify kind of going off the rails
because you feel like you deserve it and
that you should reward yourself
and rewarding yourself is totally fine
to some extent in the short term okay
that's fine as long as you can keep it
under control but what happens so often
is that people
finish their cutting phase and then they
just start eating purely based on hunger
and cravings
all dietary tracking goes out the window
and they just end up going totally
overboard so if you want to maintain
your existing body fat
moving forward after the deficit has
ended and going into the long term
there's a few very important steps that
you need to follow here so first off
forget about slow reverse dieting which
is the idea of
slowly increasing your calories from
week to week until you get back to
maintenance
there's really no point in doing that
because if you only increase your
calories by
small increments of maybe five to ten
percent per week then you're still going
to be in a net calorie deficit for
several more weeks and if you've already
reached
your goal body fat percentage there's no
need to stay in a deficit of any kind
your goal should be to get out of that
deficit
and get back to maintenance as soon as
possible so that you can get your
metabolism re-elevated and bring your
hunger and energy
back into balance remember that your
maintenance calories are what it takes
to maintain your current weight and so
by definition you're not going to gain
fat by eating
at maintenance level however the key
thing to remember is that because you
now weigh less
and because you're going to have that
certain degree of metabolic adaptation
at play
your maintenance calories at the end of
a cut are not going to be the same as
they were when you first started your
cut
so you need to increase your food intake
in a
controlled way to make sure that you
don't go excessively high
now there's no way to know what your
exact maintenance calories are because
there's just way too many factors that
influence that
and it also fluctuates as well but the
idea here is to just
generally estimate so let's say you
finished your cut
at roughly a 500 calorie deficit which
would be pretty standard
uh that would have you losing roughly
one pound of fat per week since one
pound of fat contains
uh 3 500 calories in total in that case
you can just add 500 calories back in
or if you really don't know what your
maintenance level is then you can also
just use a basic body weight multiplier
to estimate this
so assuming you're currently within a
healthy body fat range now
then something like body weight in
pounds multiplied by 15
that will usually get you around the
right general level but again this is
just a rough estimate
the point here is to increase your
calories by a moderate controlled amount
that you're still tracking in some
capacity so that you can prevent
yourself
from letting your food intake basically
turn into a runaway freight train that
you lose total control over
which is something that is very common
so don't increase your calories too
slowly or too aggressively
just add back in a moderate size chunk
straight away that you think represents
your general calorie maintenance level
and keep in mind that even if it
technically is your calorie maintenance
level
you are gonna regain a small bit of
weight uh once you do increase those
calories a bit maybe
you know two or three pounds or so and
that's because you have more food in
your system
and you're probably storing more
glycogen and more water weight as well
so
don't be alarmed if you do put on a
small amount of weight pretty quickly
because that's totally normal and then
from there
remember that your calorie maintenance
level is also a moving target so
like we talked about already when you
eat less your calorie maintenance level
slowly decreases but the opposite is
also true
when you eat more it slowly increases so
maybe you finish your cut at 2000
calories
and you increase back to 2500 that
doesn't mean that 2 500 calories is now
your lifetime maintenance calories and
you'll never be able to go above that
it's going to slowly ramp up
as your metabolism re-elevates so start
at 2500 in that case but then over time
you can watch the scale you can track
your waist measurement and then slowly
add in more food and as long as your
weight is staying relatively stable
then you can just keep increasing it to
basically find the highest calorie
intake that you can get away with
while keeping your body fat levels in a
range that you're happy with
now the next point to keep in mind is
for those who drop the body fat
they lean down and now they want to
shift into a lean gaining phase and
focus on putting on more muscle
which is pretty common you know it's
honestly rare to get to a point
where you say you know i'm 100 satisfied
with my physique and i just want to
maintain it forever um that does happen
but
not that often very often after a
cutting phase is over you're going to
have a new goal and it's usually going
to revolve around adding
more overall muscle size and strength
but if this isn't done properly
then it can also be a death sentence for
your previous fat loss results and
that's because if the goal
is now to gain more size that mental
justification for overeating
it just gets exaggerated even further
because you're going to have those
higher hunger levels like we just talked
about
but now you're telling yourself that
you're bulking and that you need the
extra calories for building muscle
and that can just very easily send you
out of control into
basically an unplanned dirty bulk
because most people
don't realize how few extra calories it
actually takes to build muscle in the
first place
which is really not that much so you
might have someone who starts their
cutting phase at a
maintenance calorie level of let's say 3
000 calories they go down to
2 500 calories to start losing the fat
then maybe they finish their cut at 2200
calories
now they go right back to 3000 calories
thinking that that's their maintenance
level
since they're not accounting for the
adaptations that happen during the cut
and they add maybe 500 calories on top
of that for bulking and so now they're
eating 3 500 calories per day
when in reality their actual maintenance
calories are
maybe something like 2700 and not 3 000
and they only need
200 extra calories per day to maximize
muscle growth and not 500
and so a more suitable intake in that
case would actually be something like
uh you know maybe 2 900 calories rather
than 3 500 so they're eating 600
calories per day
more than they actually require and
that's going to add up very quickly from
week to week
when you consider that a pound of fat
contains about 3 500 calories
so if you finish your cut and now your
focus is on gaining muscle
you need to be realistic about what your
current calorie maintenance level
actually is it's going to be lower than
it was
when you first started and you need to
be realistic about how large of a
calorie surplus you actually require
to maximize muscle growth which is
probably no more than about
100 to 200 calories above maintenance
and around 300 at the most okay you
don't need a huge surplus
for building muscle and any excess that
you take in beyond what your body can
actually utilize for building muscle
that's just going to be stored as
fat now not everyone has to precisely
track their exact calorie intake
but i would say that if you're in that
post cutting period and you want to
maintain your leanness moving forward
i would say that tracking things to some
extent at least in that initial stage
is probably going to be a good idea for
most people now technically if you're
still a novice
then you can make gains by eating just
somewhere around maintenance as long as
you get in enough protein and your
training is on point
but i think that if you've cut down to a
relatively lean body fat percentage
let's say 12
give or take then for optimal gains i do
think a small calorie surplus is going
to be ideal
if you want the very best results just
make sure that you're keeping it under
control
so if you're planning a fat loss phase
or you're in the middle of one right now
make sure to follow those guidelines
once you've hit your fat loss goal it's
so easy to screw this up
and just flush weeks and months of
effort straight down the drain but if
you follow those simple tips that i just
gave
and you have some patience you'll be one
of the few people out there who's able
to
build a lean and muscular body and
maintain it over the longer term
