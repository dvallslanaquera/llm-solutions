more more nick five more
one this will be tough
[Music]
what's up youtube
i'm dr mike clearly guess who this is
mr nick shaw he is a husband he is a
father he is
a fitness dad
but he also has a tiny little side job
of being the ceo and founder of
renaissance periodization that's right
that's our whole channel when i do bad
i'm worried about mr nick shaw firing me
so i got to be on my best behavior
clearly i wore my best walmart red
sweatshirt today impressed
uh
it could do better
no can't we all always with the boss
nick shaw has been dieting for 11 weeks
and
thinks he's lean and soon the shirt will
come off and you guys will find out he's
here he's gonna do a photo shoot later
that'll that's the only fans stuff and
then before that him and i are going to
catch a push session he's just going to
jump in with me into my push session
chest triceps i'll talk about details in
a bit nick how are you feeling you uh
been along a long road
tired
hungry
thirsty
we're ready to train ready to train that
just about sums it up folks let's get
into it
all right
you
you scallywags
what does it even mean
why british why
first up
on deck
on set on fleek
show out see
i watch cheerleading documentaries
close grip smith machine bench press
good compound pushing movement my close
grip nowadays looks like everyone's
normal grip
because your boy got too wide to do this
shit
so you can just call it regular bench in
your own head if you feel like it's not
a close grip and you get upset you want
to post comments and say that's not a
close grip you can just post that
comment your head and respond in your
head with oh it's just medium grip
or you can post because you know the
algorithm loves the comments
um
a couple sets here
three sets for me we'll see what mr nick
shaw likes
after that we move into skull crushers
here also on the smith and then we start
super setting these calls towards the
end
with deficit push-ups oh those are
mighty fine
mighty fine let's uh
yeah and this is uh sets of
gee 10 to 20 reps on this one so let's
let's do it
[Music]
dr mike you may say
i thought you were going to do 225 for
reps on here why 275 for a warm-up
because my last warm-up sometimes
i like to do
more weight than i do for reps
because
it's a gnarly gnarly potentiator
gets the
nervous system
and its peripheral
counterparts in the muscle like the
golgi tendon organ google that shit to
really tell you
the rest of you like hey
this weight the working weight not so
heavy your sfr is better your technique
is better
give it a shot just slightly heavier
it'll work out super well
[Music]
[Music]
thanks
how close the failure do you uh want me
to go you want a good pump for the
photographer
so one one to two
oh yeah
[Music]
[Music]
two more
[Music]
beautiful
can you turn that way and pop up on your
calves
scott you got to get this it's strange
that's a lot of steps
burn the fat directly off the legs
so if you're an rp super nerd you
probably already know this but
nick just mentioned that like you know
he's like a crossfitter and stuff and he
does quite a bit of running first last
couple weeks of this fat loss phase he
was just trying to get like crazy lean
he stopped running and you'd think like
what uh running burns tons of calories
why do you stop running the inside there
is that there's an sfr stimulus to
fatigue ratio for cardio
the stimulus is how much fat burning it
incurs the fatigue is well how much
fatigue does it uh
concomitantly add and the thing is like
running is unbelievably stimulative the
raw stimulus magnitude of fat burning
from running is super fucking high
however the fatigue component the
pounding etc is also really high when
you get really really really ultra super
cycline sometimes running just doesn't
have the best sfr compared to like just
getting in a lot of steps at the end of
the day that's one of the main reasons
why organically
bodybuilders have mostly trended towards
incline walking and other
slow modalities low intensity steady
state because its stimulus fatigue ratio
is amazing it does not stimulate a lot
of fat burning per unit of time but it
basically hardly fatigues you at all
you can put in lots of time and the net
sfr is still better for incline walking
than something like running some people
say running is really good for fat loss
and weight loss they're correct
but at some point if you're really
really fatigued the sfr might not make
any more sense
oh that's great yeah these are a lot
longer respects than i'm used to so my
number's gonna be a little bit higher
sure
it won't be as much of a as a drop
so normally i train by myself so i
go a little quicker
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
yep
yep more
two more
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah fuck yeah
a couple folks were asking like hey are
you gonna put nick through like like a
death workout like he does everyone else
and
but being kind of really depleted at the
end of the diet i was like i don't think
i can really do that i'm pushing pretty
hard but
i push all the way towards a death
workout it
finds a greater chance of injury
being really fatigued a little
dehydrated all that stuff so
work hard but not
crazy crazy hard
hear that mike
that sounds like excuses only we're
crazy baby we're only crazy we're crazy
out here we're in the streets
that
is how you train
to crush your own skull
i've been working on it i got a lot of
skull to crush you know
you guys ever had a crush on your own
skull
you look at your skull and you're like
just i really don't mean to impose
what are you doing tonight
i know it's short notice
your skull is like um yeah let me uh
look i'm
i have a lot a lot going on right now
it's just like it's not you oh my god
it's not you
i just my life is
which is good right because i'm so busy
but like
i'd love to reconnect and you're like oh
no no no no that's cool totally for sure
i'm also busy and you go home and you
fuck just cry
cry cry cry cry cry
ah
[Music]
fuck
one slow
good
two one more slow
oh shit fucking keep going
[Music]
fuck yeah
[Applause]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
oh yeah two more
one more
go
beautiful
beautiful
doesn't look like a lot of weight on
there but that smith machine is a lot
heavier than it looks man
if you ever come down
youtube viewer and train with us
this cybex
ion series
smith machine
is i don't know
90 pounds heavier than
something completely insane it might be
70 pounds heavier than advertised
assuming this is a 45 pound bar it's
nuts
look at me
i'm a freak
so skull crushers after that
four sets of skulls too heavy too light
after the last light set of skulls
uh by the way heavy is like sets of
around ten
lightest sets of around 15.
great sfr for those light ones after
but the raw stimulus magnitude from the
heavy ones is unbelievable
last set of the skulls as soon as i'm
done i move right over to the deficit
push-up
and do as many as i can you know to
where i are
rest about 30 seconds and then hit
another set as many as i can
nick's going to
do the same thing
that's definite push-ups are amazing
nick and i are strong enough that if we
did them fresh we'd be like trillion
reps
but if we're doing them after skulls
after all this pushing holy crap
it really is an unbelievable movement
and
the way the push-ups are leveraged
actually
is you're at the most mechanical
disadvantage
super deep and as you come up your
vector in relation to gravity decreases
so it actually gets easier which means
that it biases the heavy stretch which
is oh
like sport science magical eagle came
down it was like
yes eagle i will do these sports science
things and he's like ah and he flies
away
[Music]
i
oh
[Music]
oh
let me check how many
just in case
i have to do a second one
allegedly 12.
i don't know what i'm gonna do 12.

four last one
push-up machine hell yeah
oh man
take a quick thumbnail here
[Music]
thanks for tuning in great workout trip
to train with you again it's been a
while it's been a while yeah a long time
nick and i came up in the industry that
sounds bad already
uh we were personal trainers in new york
city and we were training partners then
it was really good stuff and
we were nobodies back then and we're
still nobody's now i'm proud to
retain that title how are you feeling mr
shaw
better better better got some blood in
there and stuff yeah excellent ready to
go eat man yeah so okay so what's your
first like
meal gonna be no you know it's crazy man
like so we went to the grocery store
last night really all i got was like a
lot of the same foods i was carving up
with because like
i don't really want to eat a bunch of
like shit food i just want more
basically just like clean food just more
clean food not having to like
be so
particular yes relax a little bit with
it and if i do that i'll be good there
you go things we tell ourselves before
we blow it up 500 pounds folks it's been
great having nick
um
pleasure
privilege
folks
youtubers tick tockers maybe even
unlikely
welcome
to the renaissance periodization channel
can you tell i'm nervous here's why
i'm with my boss
this is nick shaw ceo
founder of a renaissance periodization
he's actually french so he picked the
name
renee saltz yeah see isn't that great
you french viewers we have plenty of
viewers in france they'll appreciate it
when you speak more french later folks
nick is here visiting at the compound
think waco texas but friendlier
less violence maybe both of those are
false here's the deal
nick is here because he has other
business in the area he never just comes
to visit
our relationship
i like him that much he keeps a distance
a professional distance you could say
he's here to train and take a few photos
he already did that because he peaked
his 11 week long diet
just to try to see if he could get in
pretty ball or shape i'm sure scott the
video guy will throw some pictures and
maybe in a video too and uh he did it
nick got ultra super lean and i have
some questions for him first question
nick first of all welcome
thank you now it's good to be here yeah
second of all uh you know
what's your
deal that can go many ways can you
elaborate a bit
so first of all
why did you choose to get that what do
you had a dexa a few days ago what was
it
so i was really hoping to get down into
the fives official dexa
um
did not end up getting there ended up
being about six and a half percent
official dexa which is
pretty much the leanest i've ever been
on dexa
um but there's a couple areas that got
down into the four percent so overall i
was pretty happy
uh we had chatted about we did a big and
we talked a little bit more about this
but we had done a
pretty big carb
refuel the day before so it's hard to
really say how much that might have
impacted the dexa so at the end of the
day like
yeah it was awesome to have a dexa i had
one at the beginning i started about ten
and a half went down to six and a half
it said that i actually gained a pound
of naphthalene tissue so it's just
it's hard to say yeah and just a bit of
a tip guys on the dexa the dexa is the
most accurate commercially available
body fat analyzer if you're looking at
not commercially available it's actually
mri believe it or not you can get down
to the 10 grams with mri if you're
interested in that sort of thing it'll
cost you several thousand dollars on the
hospital staff bribe
but um
dexa while it is the most accurate
partially available body fat analysis
device it still has a pretty gnarly
error rate if you're very very super
nerdy interested in that stuff
seek out i believe these articles are
public if not they're behind the weight
ology pay wall james krieger oh they are
public has a really extensive analysis
of the error rates of various body fat
and uh analysis devices and it's
fascinating and it turns out that based
on how you look at it dex is not that
super psycho accurate in the end and
it's still a rough guess so knit could
be anywhere from 15 i'm just kidding and
it could be anywhere realistically from
like eight percent to four percent body
fat in reality but since we only have
instruments to assume you know we could
get a complete analysis of exactly the
body fat nick is by dissecting him and
weighing out his parts
but nick seems to be not a fan of that
sort of putting people back together
something science has to catch up to um
so get your leanest ever
i assume that the last several weeks
were ultra fun
they sucked big time how
so i believe you have a video that
you've done before and you talk about
is it harder if you're trying to lose
weight when you're like heavier a little
bit more body fat or if you're already
really lean i think it is
no doubt about it infinitely harder the
leaner you get and it's like an
exponential curve yeah because so i'd i
did a six-week diet back in the fall
you know probably went from i don't know
eleven percent down to like like seven
eight percent again i got a dexter at
the end
to kind of verify that i was like high
sevens that wasn't that bad of a cut
mm-hmm it was very manageable and i've
talked about on the rp podcast
it wasn't bad it was just getting a
little tough towards the end it was just
getting a little tough towards the end
like my step count started to really get
up there but i knew that it was done in
six weeks and that was it yeah yeah this
oh man it's a whole nother animal
and
even if i would have stopped after about
eight weeks i would have been like man
that was like that was tough
but it was good
but going from basically you know weeks
9 10 and 11
really pushing it
is it's just a different animal i i
think maybe it was someone like john
meadows i remember i'm saying it like
there's just no way around it like being
that lean you start getting down like
that you know sub seven into the six
percent there's just a general
level of like
fatigue slash
suffering slash misery that you just
have to kind of deal with and there's
just i don't know around it yeah certain
low body fat your body kind of
constantly keeps you awake to try to get
food not only do you think about food
all the time but you wake up at like
five in the morning like this with your
eyes wide open and you're like
i'm up but you're not rested you're just
awake
um something i don't uh have going on in
my life but you do is you have children
two children ages
uh ten and eight so they're they're very
manageable they're very good kids
they're very good kids but nonetheless
as a father and a husband and a
homeowner and a member of the esteemed
member of the community something i've
zero of those things are true about me
husband technically true but other than
that i'm not esteemed at all um how was
it just
balancing regular busy dad life
and getting into this unreal
conditioning
you know so again it's very similar
up until like the last few weeks it
wasn't that bad so i was
you know i go to my daughter's softball
on monday you know kind of hang out
there a little practice or practice yeah
sometimes games but like you know
whatever like sometimes i'll have to
pitch in and help a little bit how
exciting if a sport is eight-year-old
softball oh it's
better than the olympics unbelievable
please go on unbelievable
uh
usually like twice a week i'd help
volunteer like my son's jiu jitsu
classes um
like that was all fine until the last
couple weeks when you're just low on
energy and it just
i don't know man there's just something
about it where if you if you sit down
sometimes it's hard to get up and get
going but i i found that the more if i
could just kind of kept myself active
and moving around a little bit it
actually was like easier you have like
just a little bit of that momentum takes
your mind off of the misery too you're
just doing stuff yep 100 nick i'm a
i'm a
businessman and a dad and all this stuff
and
i'm thinking i want to get pretty damn
lean what are some tips you have for me
maybe some do's maybe some don'ts
so
don't try to get this lean do not get
this lean i'm just kidding yeah no i
mean it is really all about trade-offs
though so
again
it sucked but it was all voluntary so i
kind of had to remind myself of that
like why am i going to complain i'm
owning the process i'm voluntarily doing
this
um you know i've had a lot of you know
shit in my life with you know my wife
and like that that's real life actual
hard shit like this is all voluntary so
again was i perfect no i'm sure i was
probably you know a little grumpy and
all that towards the end and lori
probably said quite a bit grumpy you
know whatever for the last couple weeks
but like that's part of it you just have
to maybe be a little bit more mindful of
it because i do
remember competing like a decade ago and
like i was just a lot more immature like
his early twenties and just like
selfless asshole basically whereas like
i think you're an asshole but jeez
i don't know is it just being a bit more
mature and just like being a bit more
mindful of all this stuff now where it's
like okay yeah i know that i'm actually
not really you know angry frustrated or
whatever like
just kind of deal with it and make the
right choice try to do the right thing
so i mean do try to be more mindful of
all that i think that's a really good
tip um
do
man my carbs towards the end outside of
like the workout window was nothing but
fruits and veggies yeah why
very filling yep
that's and they digest slow so you don't
have the sugar
absolute must absolute must i mean i
posted some pictures on my instagram
it basically be you could get a six
ounce little thing of raspberries that's
10 grams of carbs
so if you have 30 or 40 grams of carbs
you can have four of those it fills a
giant bowl just nothing but berries
and then you throw in some you know
broccoli or whatever and your your
proteins
i mean you have two real big bowls of
food that can last you like it'll help
fill you up yes now is it going to take
away all hunger no of course not but
like that makes such a huge difference
like compare that the one thing i did
realize if i eat rice
forget about it you're just in and out
20 minutes later i'm like i don't even
know if i just ate a meal yeah so i like
that's just a very simple thing
um
do try to keep yourself busy occupied so
this is going to be really funny but
like i remember at the beginning of the
diet my son had um him and i were
playing a nintendo switch like a zelda
game
nick dude that's an easy way to pass an
hour or two of time and you don't even
realize it now i didn't play it at the
end like when i was in the
basically suffering
but uh yeah that's something i kind of
laughed at where i was like this could
actually be a pretty good tip or trick
like when you're sure
when you're really that deep so um
those are some some do's i would say the
don'ts
i i kind of had to really scale back a
couple things i had to scale back my
jujitsu like the last month like i just
didn't really have the energy to do a
lot of live rolling and i didn't want to
get hurt
um and so like i i train i try to train
year round to be ready for murphy not
murphys it's a workout in crossfit yeah
it's a crossfit workout you run a mile
you're wearing a bodyweight vest you run
a mile you do 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups
300 bodyweight squats and you run a mile
at the end so like that's every memorial
day so i want to make sure that i'm in
shape for that because last year i
basically got my butt kicked doing it so
i've
you know
once a month i'll try to somehow do
something to kind of keep ready for that
i kind of had to back off things like
that cardio the last um
you know last month because i just just
didn't have it man so that's curious
why did you back off on cardio when your
goal was fat loss
so let me clarify i backed off on higher
intensity cardio
so
i basically would replace it with so
instead of running a mile or something
like that after lifting because again
like and i know this is a little bit
different than kind of the
main
takeaways from this channel where you're
talking about like bodybuilding purely
hypertrophy like
i'm not trying to be a massive
bodybuilder anymore it's just not kind
of my
thing that i'm training for so i just
want to be in general shape and i just
want friends that's why i'm doing this
not working
[Music]
um but yeah so i just replaced it with
lower intensity cardio so
just up up the step count i mean the
last month it was interesting because i
pulled up the little app thing that i
have from from this tracker
and uh like my average was like over 15k
steps which i don't know it might not be
that high that's hard yeah it depends
you know some people big oh you know i
work some such job i average 15 and 20
like all right but usually i would get
around like 10k
so to go from 10
to 12 would be pretty significant to go
from 12 up to like 14 15 is
it's pretty intense the fat really just
melts off at that point yeah i mean i
was making a very conscious effort the
last like three weeks on the weekends i
have two rest days in a row
and you know my carbs would be a little
bit lower i was definitely aiming for
like 15 16. i think the highest i got up
to is like 18k steps
good god it's a lot
nick before we let you go
back to your family
um you mentioned earlier that you know
this cut was voluntary and it was yes it
was hard it was the other world
you mentioned offhand that you've been
through some quote real shit with your
wife do you care to expand on that a
little bit
yeah man um she went through uh breast
cancer in 2020 so she like had she was
going through chemo like during the
pandemic and during all that stuff so
yeah it's like real life shit not like
you know shit you didn't choose yeah but
bodybuilding's hard don't get me wrong
but like come on at the end of the day
like we choose to do it it sucks yeah
but
you know it's like
it's not really something to complain
about too much like i don't know i hope
hopefully i wasn't too much of a
complainer to folks i tried to remind
myself of that like why am i complaining
about this like i chose to do this so
yeah um
but one thing i want to go back to so i
kind of had to ask myself this question
a couple times too and you can say well
why like why do you want to do this
you're not even competing or whatever so
there's a couple reasons
i mean you know you know me like we grew
up
we wanted to be bodybuilders like really
all we wanted to do and i kind of like
made the conscious choice to trade that
off like when i had kids and rp was
really taken off so
one i actually have like a little more
free time now
because we have a lot of really great
awesome people that work for rp like
scott the video guy and you just ride
their coattails yes
that's what i've been doing elon musk
just sends tweets yes
but like that's a very real thing like
now i have a little bit more time so
like
i'm not
working in the business so much like i
actually have a little bit more time and
so like that's one reason why number two
um
i just wanted to kind of like
i use all of our stuff every single day
that's right you're an app user i'm an
app user i use the mail physique
templates
like i live eat breathe this stuff every
single day so it's been really cool to
interact with everyone on instagram
that's like you know they'll see the
meals that i post they'll see the
numbers that i'm posting from the app
like they'll see all this stuff so you
didn't have a coach you had the rp diet
app
yeah yeah that's awesome i just ran the
app yep so i just ran that and i ran the
mail physique templates
pretty much by myself yo
was that your phone or mine that's mine
that's really cool please leave that in
was that siri or whatever samsung
assistant randomly picks up voice stuff
every now and again
bitch stay the fuck out of our
conversation you feel me who do i have
to talk about this who's in charge of
samsung
i don't know charlie
um
would she have a name i don't know bixby
or something really oh
i never use it so i can tell you but
yeah well she apparently wants to talk
please go on
uh yeah so i mean just more free time
like
i i use all this stuff myself uh we're
not just sitting up here talking about
this shit like we're all about it um and
you know three uh to be honest man i
i just wanted to kind of see if i still
had it
and uh you know it depends on what
people not everyone would say that maybe
i do maybe those results suck but you
know
well relative to the kind of shape
you've been in this is the best shape
of all time for you
i mean
very very close i think i was maybe
similar to this in 2015 i was a little
bit heavier though but uh
yeah no i mean i'm very very happy with
the end results of this yeah yeah
well i'll tell you what nick it's been
good to chat with you good having you
here
and uh scott the video guy you got
anything clever to say you always talk
that smack about nick though if nick
shows up we'll throw these hands he's
right here
he got shredded and he made me proud he
earned all my respect there you go thank
you sir folks
