hey folks last time we built
a powerlifting peaking program week one
this time we're going to learn how to
run a peaking program for powerlifting
modifying the lifts week to week to week
tapering off the volume deloading and
then peeking so we can have as good of a
power lifting meat as possible or
even if you're not competing as good of
a gym
mock meat as you possibly can let's get
the basic setup going
we have five other videos previous to
this one in the series
two on hypertrophy two on strength
one on peaking if you watch this video
just by itself
you get something out of him if you
watch the other five videos or the more
of the merrier you get a ton out of them
so
here we go we're going to talk about the
sample program we built last time
we're going to set the mesocycle length
relative effort progression volume
progression or in this case regression
how to deload and finish off the taper
and of course what to do
after the actual peak occurs so here's
the sample program feel free to pause
and re-familiarize yourself if you have
absolutely no idea how the fuck we built
this
check out the last video the previous
one in the series and we go through and
we build it manually step by step
mesocycle length
we need to know how fast to progress and
mesocycle length has to determine that
for us
it's really quite simple however far you
are from your next meet
that's how long the mezzo will be
generally speaking
peaking is productive when it's done for
between three
and five weeks long including its deload
the three weeks including deload may
mean that you work hard for two weeks
deload compete five weeks means you work
hard you build up
and load for four weeks down in volume
we'll get to that in a sec
and then you take a deload week and you
go all right where
you go within that range is meet
scheduling let's say you finish a
strength phase and you have four weeks
left well that's three up on down
uh training age and recovery ability
trial and error if nothing else
uh but honestly where your meat is
is going to be the huge determining
factor and all of your other phases and
how they line up
can you peak for less than three weeks
you can
not ideal can you peak for longer than
five ah
man it's really just not sustainable to
be training that heavy that long
and especially it's not just not
sustainable you can sort of
sort of string it out to where it makes
sense but then you probably would just
be best doing less of that and more of
an actual strength meso because remember
in the peaking
phase from a technical sports science
perspective
we can't really say you're gaining a lot
of strength you're revealing your
strength
so the gaining part is uh
you know that's really done in the
strength phase so if you have a lot of
time to killing or i could do an eight
week peaking phase
maybe do a four week feeking phase and
slap another four week
strength mesocycle and you'll actually
perform that much better because you'll
get stronger
an eight-week peaking phase just really
rolls out the red carpet super slow
until you compete
all right so that's determined
relative effort progression pretty
straightforward if you've seen the
strength in aperture if you want you're
going to be used to this
but here's the thing
in the actual meso itself in the
accumulation you will not hit an rp 10.
you are going to hit an rp9 so you start
at rp7 in week 1
and you progress to rp9 in that last
week before deloading
usually there are many exceptions to
this if you become very advanced it
could be two weeks out if you're a super
beginner it could be the last week
and then you take half a deload and go
but this is on average for a good
intermediate program just the basics
that we can wiggle them later
all right if this is the case you
almost never in that last big effort
before your meet whether it be
usually we'll say it's one week out you
don't want to hit rp10 our p10 fatigues
the living fuck out of you
you want to really be at super super low
fatigue
for your actual competition but
contradictory to some extent
you won't have been exposed to ultra
heavy stimulus and ultra heavy actual
weight on the bar
rp9 offers the best of both worlds
rp10 is a great stimulus but you may be
too beat up and too fatigued
a lot of the great powerlifting
champions of all times
they people have asked them i've
personally been one of the people to
interview a bunch of great powerlifters
and ask them a bunch of that is on
the juggernaut um training systems
youtube
we asked them what do you have any
regrets or what do you think people
should be doing now that you maybe
screwed up when you were younger and
they said you know what
a lot of them say i didn't delude enough
so on and so forth but a lot of them
will say i took way too many
heavy ass singles too close to the meat
i was going to do
and there's actually videos of power
lifters hitting like
for doubles what they ended up hitting
for singles with the meat you don't want
to be one of those people because the
meat is the only thing that really
matters if you want to be great
the better you want to be you know can
you imagine like i'm sure you guys have
met some of these people probably from
this before they hit like a certain like
big squad in a meat or a decent squat
and they come up to you and you're like
dude that was awesome like yeah hit that
for a double you know two weeks ago
you're like
first of all nobody gives a shit second
of all like shut up
right that just means you're a shitty
programmer so at the end of the day
actual peak will be our p10 you start at
rp7
ish work up however long you get to rp9
then deload then rp10 not the other way
around
right now of course you have to fill in
the loads yourself to hit these rpe
targets every you know
the whole road between seven and nine
it'll say you could maybe three weeks or
four weeks to get there
uh it could be seven eight nine could be
some doubles could be fractional 7.5
8.5 rp however you like to do it just
make sure roughly you're ascending in
load and ascending in relative effort
and of course the way to send and
relative effort is to put more load on
the bar you're not going to be adding
reps because that's way outside of the
room specificity and
you may actually be reducing repetitions
you may be starting with triples going
to doubles and going to singles that's a
very good way to progress
so you know an rp7 triple is potentially
way lighter
than an rp8 double which is way lighter
than an rp9 single
so these are sometimes going to be
pretty big load jumps which is okay
just give your absolute best guess to
what's going on and because you usually
get a couple of sets at these things
uh if your you know first attempt at an
rp9 single was like
yeah that was really an rpn8 then you
can increase load a little bit for your
second set
uh or if it was the other way around if
it was like dude that might have been
like an rp 9.75 or some shit
don't repeat that lift take weight off
the bar and hit a reel you know 8.5 8.75
rp
so this is average out to nine okay
because it's not a good idea
to just grind it because some people say
like oh that was way too heavy like all
right well you got another set like it's
two sets today they're like yeah
i'll just repeat it like what are you
doing then you're literally just asking
to hit an rp10
and then what are you gonna do for the
meat when you're too fatigued bad deal
now if you can't progress and load
you're really fucking something up and
it's a real big problem
if you hit mrv maximum carbon volume
can't progress and load
you cannot and should not hit mrv in the
middle or towards the end or any part
of a peaking phase the closest you come
to mrv is actually in week one and then
all the volume drops off and the load
goes up
so if you're so fatigued that you have
trouble hitting your planned loads
you're in a bad spot and you need to
rethink some things
right so in a strength phase yeah you
fucked up not the end of the world in a
hybrid phase a shit happens right you
literally learn in a peaking phase good
god
air on the side of conservative load
increases conservative volume
progressions take more volume away than
less
because you really want that meat to go
super well and the low fatigue state is
the critical critical key to doing that
volume progression in this case is a
misnomer it's actually a regression why
well we have to reduce fatigue as we get
closer and closer to the meat
at the meat you want to be almost zero
fatigue so you really have all of your
fitness you're as strong as you've ever
been
strength is here or underlying ability
to produce strength and
fatigue is here that that fitness
strength minus fatigue that's called
preparedness you want the highest
possible preparedness
which means you want very low fatigue
because that
gives you that room cool thing
you have some assistance work in this
plan that we designed but in the last
several weeks you don't need assistance
work because you can't
lose an appreciable amount of muscle if
you're eating normally and not
doing something insane or not sleeping
you can't really lose a ton of muscle
it'll affect anything as far as strength
in the last two weeks so especially in
the last two weeks but generally the
entire time
you could be reducing assistance volume
potentially getting rid of it all
together
that brings fatigue down like crazy
don't worry about your muscle mass
and it is going to allow you to keep
maximum strength lowest fatigue and
express yourself really well so the
volume from the assistance work is going
down
you essentially end up doing this you
start at somewhere between your minimum
factor volume maximum recoverable we
covered this in the last video
something that really fatigues you
towards the end of the workout and then
you do less
and less and less so you reduce volume
on assistance work until it's gone
probably gone right at that rp nine week
so that last heavy hard training week
before the deload
you probably want to do most people
would want to do
no assistance work there whatsoever so
that last week before is where it gets
extracted completely
and on your technique work you probably
also want to reduce volume technique
work
so that it's just one set in that
pre-deload week
so that last week rp9 week is gonna have
no assistance work for most people
and when you do your uh your super light
technique work is just gonna be one set
at a time like one set per session
that's almost nothing great that's
exactly what you need that last week you
should be lifting ultra heavy loads
but at the end of that you're like you
know i feel pretty fucking good and then
you get a whole deal a week after that
what do you think is gonna happen
physiologically psychologically you're
gonna be like oh my god
i wish thanos would show up to my place
with
all that shit in his fucking hand i'll
punch that motherfucker in the face
squat
bench and dead lift his ass into pieces
some wanda maximoff type shit
that's how you want to feel because a
lot of people look forward to a taper
and they're like
oh my god i'm doing almost nothing good
good
you want to be pissed about that because
if you come into a meet
and someone's like you're ready to squat
you're oh no i'm feeling pretty beat up
holy shit did you fuck up
the volume taper is a weird idea to get
used to but it works
this is based on research from like many
many many olympic champions from 50
different sports
generations of stuff it works it's a big
pill to swallow
give it a shot i've said that in other
contexts
all right so here we go
hopefully the videography on this works
out but
what we're gonna do is progress week one
week two and then week three
and i'm not gonna talk about that much
because you just have to see these
alterations what i want you to look for
is set numbers i want you to look for is
all the loading and reps and exercise
things are going to come out things are
going to leave watch those volumes
and those loads you're going to see a
progression and load
and you're going to see a regression in
volume
as we go from one week to the next to
the next
very different but basically we have
week one week two and then week three
it's a big difference now pause and on
your own time take a look through the
outlet
when you're done with it we're gonna
look at week number four so this is just
a sample of a four week up one week down
peak we can do them many other ways
here this is the pre-deload week this is
the rp9 week
so as you can see there's not a lot to
display which is why this is smaller
because where the hell so first of all
the technique work is just down to one
set
as promised and where the hell is all
that assistance work it's gone just like
we said it would be
this these are psychologically pretty
difficult workouts because
fuck you got three sets of low bar squat
and the one to three rep range
oftentimes this is singles at this point
not mandatory but a good idea
at rp9 holy crap and this crazy crazy
poundage
but then after that everything's
relatively easy that's the point
that last week shouldn't really add to
your fatigue
shouldn't take it away but it shouldn't
really add to it the entire time your
fatigue
so we we basically have this table where
volume is leaving intensity is going up
that means our fatigue kind of just
hangs around the same area
maybe goes down a little bit that last
week not much happens
but because our fatigue never went up
it's actually a pretty reasonable level
and then when we do the d load the
fatigues bloop and it's super low which
makes you really really able to express
yourself
really well at the actual meat itself
now deloading before the peak
is different than deloading for
hypertrophy and for strength
a good approach is this and there's many
many ways to skin this cat like i've
said i think in other videos
skinning a cat must be too fucking
terrible for the cat
where are the animal rights activists
not letting us say these things
should be triggered so first half of the
week
in a standard typical average right good
idea maybe not the best
for everyone good idea for this for the
average deload week before a meet
is the first half of the week you do
only technique lifting right yep
sets of three to six at seventy percent
super super easy and then the second
half of the week
mostly you just do nothing you just rest
and you may think to yourself like
dude i will be a psychotic animal by the
end of this
perfect that's when we release you from
your cage
and the only thing you see is red
everywhere and a squat bar
and then we you get the electric prodder
after your three sets of squats put you
back in the cage throw you peanut butter
sandwiches
and then when the benches come out we
release you in the cage again you do
your bench
that whole idea right so it's very very
easy just in case you're confused of
what that looks like here's a sample
you'll notice monday and wednesday it's
really really easy stuff
two sets of just really really compared
to what we were doing in the
in the entire peaking meso before this
this is just chump change you'll feel
like oh yeah i'm like feeling my swag a
little bit like this is cool like
i feel like i'm lifting but i'd love to
go heavy but i'm not allowed to then you
leave the gym
pretty frustrated then thursday you rest
friday so saturday here is your actual
meat
friday you may choose to come in and
just do a few
sets of each lift squat bench deadlift
with the just the bar
or if you're really strong up to like
135 pounds
for just triples just to feel out that
groove shake the rust off a little bit
a little bit of technical practice on
friday can pay the tiniest
but notable dividends for you on
saturday just have to
extra crisp groove and get that five
more two and a half pound more pr on
your bench or whatever than you wanted
to or sorry then you then you could have
without this but totally optional it's
totally optional
and no one's really even sure if it's a
better idea for powerlifting in
weightlifting it is absolutely a better
idea because technique is so super
important
in powerlifting if you said hey how
important is that friday
because like that friday i'm actually
driving the whole day or i'm at the
hotel chilling and i have other lifters
they're on my team i don't have access
to equipment i'd have to drive away to a
gym
they don't set up the power lifting meet
until saturday should i really be
lifting
fuck no super optional i can't even tell
you it's gonna be for sure a good idea
but if you feel like you really need
something this is the most you should do
i'll put it to you like that
now you watch all these videos we filmed
all the six videos you put together this
crazy program you pr by a trillion
pounds in everything
you kill thanos also you do a power
lifting meat
what do you do after the meat okay
first at least take a de-load week after
the meet if you really need to get in
the gym and lift some stuff
preferably a week of active rest where
you just fuck off and nobody sees you
like hey i heard that
that lifter from our gym did a
competition this past saturday how'd it
go people are going pretty well
have you seen him around us thursday
like no i think he quit the sport he's
never coming back to the gym
good let people think that leave the gym
for at least one week
maybe two if you're really beat up
because after real hardcore powers you
meet you'll have this like
like you're really happy they give you a
trophy you know you you finally
you know proposed to your loving fiance
or whatever happens at powerlifting
meets
and then you are feeling this like
totally toast
some of you guys have competed before
you know like you wake up the day after
me you're like
did i get in by a truck last night we
started drinking after the meat i don't
remember like nope nope just the meat
right your back will feel weird your
shoulders will feel weird you'll have
all these little
these little pins and nicks everywhere
you may after a week feel
a thousand percent or not like if you're
squatting benching and deadlifting
hundreds and hundreds like six seven
hundred
eight hundred pounds two weeks man two
weeks
so at least a week preferably two of
active rest
then you ease in to a strength of
hypertrophy phase after how do you do
a strain throughout periphery phase we
got videos on that right in this very
playlist but
super big last caveat before i let you
guys go here's well actually you could
just click stop and get the fuck out any
time you want i feel like i'm still a
professor with actual students that we
can
help you know hold captive in a
classroom last thing
ease in means ease in do not
go in after a week of active rest in a
fucking
month of low volume and start doing sets
of ten
four or five sets and get ultra pumped
ultra sore
crush yourself possibly get hurt don't
do that
when you come back after like
let's say you took the jose to the full
monty you did a five week peak
the last three weeks of which are unreal
low volume
and you did two weeks of active rest so
what is that like
five weeks of barely anything you could
call training
you're untrained okay more or less
that first week should be like two sets
of five
on basic derivatives for hypertrophy
like close grip bench
high bar squat deficit deadlift two sets
of five
seven rpe fucking easy shit shut it down
leave no extra assistance work you will
get pumped
you will get soared hopefully you
recover on time
the next half of the week you know two
to three sets of five
then that week two maybe three sets of
five
maybe it sets a six etcetera etcetera
then through that whole first mesocycle
you build from sets of like five
even three to five up to sets of five to
ten
your volume grows as you're able to
recover more and more
so that first cycle be it strength or
hypertrophy when you come back
has to have that easing in component if
you just go straight into the teeth
you're gonna get fucked up and you might
get hurt and you're not going to get a
whole lot out of it
i've made this mistake like 10 trillion
times myself here's the thing
the biggest factor with this mistake is
you're so fucking ready to train
you so much want to beat your own ass
because for five weeks yeah you've been
winning powerlifting meets but you
really haven't been training all that
hard you just can't wait
be easy ease in it's the easiest games
you'll ever make in your life
take them because doing more upfront has
only downsides and no upsides
folks thanks for tuning in hopefully
this whole video series makes a bunch of
sense
we'll be back next week with more videos
that hopefully also make sense but in
case they don't i've been mike azratel
for renaissance periodization see you
next time
you
