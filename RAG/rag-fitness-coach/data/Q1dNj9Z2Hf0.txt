today is back day
the first exercise of the day is going
to be
bent over deficit rows and the way we
create deficit
at least i do is i just use shorter
plates 25 pound plates opposed to 45
[Music]
let's go full shirtless okay it's
totally fine in this gym
okay shut up and get naked that's your
[Music]
job
[Music]
i'd say building momentum in a
prep is pretty important um
it's easier done when you have good
habits that are already built up because
it's second nature to you
having a good sleep hygiene uh having a
good schedule
having your meals set up properly uh
having your work schedule
set up properly and i feel like a lot of
that
is important to have if you want to
build up that momentum from the
beginning
to have a successful prep how do you
think
uh more full
[Applause]
[Music]
doing some seated rows to get some extra
volume um
it's not axial fatigue
you guys are seated so it's a great way
to get some
a little more mid upper back
stimulation without any more lower back
stimulation so let's get it
[Music]
yeah i'm tired but much less tired
than my last mezzo which i felt like
complete death
oh yeah i'll start like an asshole
training-wise my issue is that
sometimes i lose sight of the overall
picture
and i tend to train too hard
and i know i'm out of my groove at
certain points in the meso
usually too early on i start
accumulating
local fatigue and also overall fatigue
i'm tired all the time i'm walking
around everything's hard to do
mood is shot sleep gets horrible
but those are very clear indications
that i'm out of the groove and
uh easy way to fix that is dial back on
training intensity
that's actually happened this prep yes i
was hitting
gnarly prs but this is not a time to hit
pr's
this is time to get to my prep lose fat
maintain your muscle
mass and i lost sight of that because
one inexperience this is my first actual
prep
and two a little bit you know of bravado
you know ego
that's something you need to check
hello you guys can pose without like
clothes but you have to
wear clothes
i didn't want to i hate working with my
shirt off
i hate it
thank you for saving me i thought
there's a hardcore
bodybuilding brother i thought we could
lift our shirts off
wow this
is a close grip neutral
grip pull down um usually like finishing
off my
horizontal row days with uh
some kind of pull-down variation uh
lighter weights
at the end just get a little bit more
back stimulation
at a different angle also not actually
fatiguing
so that's why i thought he's in i do my
heavier pull downs on a different day
yeah great stuff
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
i got a good pump
maintained somewhat similar volume from
last week
kind of just trying to make it through
this
uh week of training last week of
training until my show
but uh overall i feel pretty good pretty
great how much how much pain do you
bring
you know what i'm saying i i bring all
the pain all right
all the pain

back poses look

or so uh i didn't have any hamstring
detail before
