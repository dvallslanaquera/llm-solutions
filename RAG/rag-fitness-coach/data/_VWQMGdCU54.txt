when it comes to developing the upper
body the bench press is a common go-to
exercise
and for good reason too it's undoubtedly
a time-tested exercise
[Music]
but can the push-up an exercise often
overlook due to simplicity compete with
the bench press
the 2017 study by kikuchi and nakazatum
compared the bench press and push-up for
muscle and strength gain
18 young men with at least one year of
training experience
was split into a bench press group and
push-up group
[Music]
the bench press group used 40 of their
one rep max
the push-up group adjusted their hands
and feet to mimic a resistance that
would be roughly equivalent to a forty
percent of one arm load on the bench
press
for some participants this may have been
regular push-ups
while for others it may have been
variations of kneeling push-ups
[Music]
you may be questioning the use of a 40 1
ram load
however a previous met analysis by
schoenfield and colleagues
demonstrated that loads between 30 and
85 percent of one ram
induce similar muscle growth provided
reps are taken to failure
both groups perform three sets of their
exercise to failure
twice per week for eight weeks
ultrasound imaging was used to obtain
thickness of the pectoralis major
and triceps brachii before and after the
training period
one rep max on the bench press was also
tested before and after the training
period
what the researchers found was that the
push-up group similarly increased
pectoralis major thickness
and triceps thickness to the bench press
group
put differently the push-up was as
effective as the bench press for
hypertrophy of the pectoralis major
and triceps as for increases in bench
press warning max
both groups experience statistically
similar increases
although looking at the overall
percentage increases
it does slightly favor the bench press
group
it's quite likely that the small
advantage with the bench press group
was a result of the principle of
specificity
although the push-up is quite
bio-mechanically similar to the bench
press
it makes sense that the bench press
group would have been more primed for
one rep max test on the bench press
given they were training the movement
for eight weeks
something that isn't a limitation of the
study itself but in practice
is that both groups use the 40 1rm load
as mentioned earlier for muscle growth
this is perfectly fine
as we know similar muscle growth is
achieved with loads ranging from 30
to 85 1rm however
when it comes to maximizing strength we
know heavier loads are generally
preferred
and therefore it could be argued that
for overall strength development
the bench presses superior as heavy
loads can easily be used
while it is undeniable the bench press
is far simpler to use heavier loads with
week to week you can actually create
heavier resistances with the push-up
through manipulating your body position
a 2011 study by ebene colleagues
explored what percentage of your body
weight you press during different
variations of the push-up
during a regular push-up you are
pressing roughly 64
of your body weight elevating your feet
increases this percentage
while elevating your hands decreases
this percentage
kneeling push-ups have you pressed
roughly 49 of your body weight
you could perform variations that have
you performing a low amount of reps
and you may progress through adding reps
here and there but also through
performing harder push-up variations
thereby allowing you to continuously use
heavier resistances
and lower rep ranges a 2018 study by
kotaski and colleagues did compare
progressive push-up training to the
bench press
the muscle and strength gain 23 men
with two to six months of training
experience were randomly assigned to a
progressive push-up group
or bench press group the bench press
group started out with 3 sets of 6 reps
with a given load
and aimed to add reps until they
achieved 3 sets of 8 reps
once they achieved 3 sets of 8 reps load
was increased by 4.5 kg
and they reverted back to three sets of
six reps
this cycle was repeated throughout the
study
here are the different exercises given
to the push-up group
if a participant in the group could
perform three sets of three reps on a
particular single arm progression
they started on this exercise if they
couldn't
they started on a double arm variation
they could complete for three sets of
six reps
once a participant could perform three
sets of eight reps with a double arm
variation
they progress to the next level whereas
if a participant was performing a single
arm variation
once they achieved three sets of four
reps they progressed to the next level
this cycle was repeated throughout the
study
both groups trained three times per week
for four weeks
ultrasound imaging was used to obtain
thickness of the pectoralis major
warner max on the bench press was
assessed too
also for both groups the level of
push-up according to the table they
could comfortably perform was assessed
before and after
for increases in pectoralis major
thickness both groups experience
statistically similar increases
however if we looked to the raw
percentages we can see the push-up group
actually had a slight advantage both
groups significantly increased their
one-round max from the bench press
with no statistically significant
differences between them
however looking at the raw percentages
the bench press group does appear to
have outperformed the push-up group
this again is likely due to the
principle of specificity
also following the principle of
specificity the push-up group on average
were able to perform a push-up variation
2.78 levels higher than at the start of
the study
while the bench press group only
progressed by 0.78 levels
which basically isn't any progression at
all
one limitation of this study is that it
only lasted four weeks
it would have been interesting to see
how the study design would pan out in
the long term
nevertheless as we can see from both the
longitudinal studies detailed in this
video
the push-up does a very respectable job
compared to the bench press
it seems that for hypertrophy of the
chest and triceps
the push-up has similar potential to the
bench press
unfortunately neither of the studies
looked at growth of the anterior deltoid
however research by tiller found that
weighted push-ups elicits similar
activation of the anterior deltoid to
the bench press
at four different load equated
conditions although emg
which is used to measure muscle
activation comes with its limitations
given the biomechanical similarities
between their exercises
is likely a good chance both exercises
induce similar anterior deltoid growth
just as a reminder although the bench
press is simple to overload
ashland in a kotaski study as well as
the ebbin study
there are tons of harder push-up
variations that can be used to apply
progressive overload
again a combination of adding reps and
performing harder variations is what can
be done
other push-up variations are not shown
in this video include the
resistance-banded push-ups
and weighted push-ups which are both
great options too
moreover you can combine different
push-up variations
for instance you could perform
resistance-banded elevated feet push-ups
[Music]
something that is essential i mentioned
is that even though this video is a
comparison between the two movements
we must remember that in practice we
don't need to pick either all
both the push-up and bench press can be
included in the training program
successfully
[Music]
when it comes to maximizing hypertrophy
or strength the use of only one
exercise will likely not achieve this
and as we've seen from the two
longitudinal studies in this video
the push-up actually has quite a good
carry over to bench press strength
thanks for making it to the end of the
video if you enjoyed it it would be
greatly appreciated if you leave a like
also let me know what you thought of
this video what are your opinions on the
bench press and push up
do you perform either or even both in
your training program
i have plenty of more videos planned so
if you think you'd enjoy my videos
it'd be awesome if you consider
