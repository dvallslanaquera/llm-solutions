oh mama me it's good to be back folks
welcome back to weekly webinar i
am the montana man dr james hoffman he
is running for president dr mike israel
get out there and vote get out there and
vote james you're my running mate
remember i know that was that video got
me i had nothing to do with that it
caught me off guard it was pretty funny
i had nothing to do with that clip
selection uh i we were just like on the
spot it was like uh running mates oh
yeah let's ask dr james and then scott
was looking for a video clip of we were
gonna include you
burping like 10 times in a row but the
first
clip the first clip he clicked on was
that
sound bite and we're like oh my god
this is this is destiny it's funny
because we recorded so many of these rp
plus videos like years ago at this point
so you say so much stupid shit over the
course of
years like you just forget it right and
that one was funny so um enough banter
folks apologies this week we are going
to do a relatively quick one today so
let's just get
right to business here and then
hopefully maybe we can pick up a little
bit of the slack next time
this one a little bit shorter than
normal
all right all right here we go
first up thanos got it
a few questions for mike regarding his
training several years back when i
followed your training on your other
channel
i saw you accomplish by the way that
channel is dead in the water so don't
bother following me on there because
some of you guys are going to be those
which channel like don't worry i never
post and never will um
i accomplished great feats of strength
and volume squatting nearly 500
actually it was exactly 500 atg for four
or five sets oh nearly if i get 475 for
four sets of eight to ten
barbell running 300 plus restrict sets
over pressing 250 plus for multiple sets
in h12 range just to name a few
as recent years i've not seen you do
very heavy rates like that yet i would
say you're the biggest salinas you have
ever been my question is
what is the reasoning for change in the
intensity and how come you are still
able to progress
if you are doing less weight with just a
strict form how come for example you
went to four by 10 and 475 atg barbell
squats
and now 4x10 and 340ish would still make
progress
if you were performing in the same
standard and volume wouldn't that be
regression by definition not able to
invoke growth or is it just a matter of
volume in sports supplements
uh i was already in sports supplements
for those lifts by the way uh where
uh were you at the point where you were
perhaps too strong to keep adding volume
because the cosmetic ratio is too high
so yes this question might come out to
be very specific to yourself but there
are any applications general immunity
advanced lifter thanks for
everything guys content it's a great
question it's actually very easy to
answer
uh i'm much stronger than i ever was
currently
but the way i do exercises sometimes
it's difficult to externally
view it internally my stimulus to
fatigue ratio for hypertrophy is the
highest it's ever been
the specific way i position my body is
to maximally stimulate the muscle
not to lift the most weight back in
those days it was kind of like a 50 50.
so i was really like when i do the those
squats that 500 for 10
i was using everything i could and i was
staying upright but i was using
everything i could
to squat now when i squat it's like 90
quads or some insane shit there's a huge
my muscle connection so on and so forth
the stimulus to the muscle is higher
than ever the individual muscles are
stronger than ever in addition to that
i use a bit more pre-exhaust now
sometimes a lot more
or more specific training than i did
back then so for example when i did 475
for reps in the squat back then that was
the first exercise
now almost every squat you'll ever see
me do is after a whole shitload of leg
pressing or hack squatting which is much
more specific
i used to do hack squats back then for
like i would say roughly
400 for sets of 10 to 15. i have since
hack squatted
575 for a set of 20 so
in a very comparable machine so my quads
are way bigger
and they are stronger so are my
shoulders solar as everything else
but i choose my lifts with a much much
better stimulus and fatigue ratio and
even the slight change in the approach
radically drops the external load while
maximizing the internal load
to the target muscle itself the take
home from this is
make sure you're renorming your lifts
every now and again if they ever drift
too far into the i'm just getting the
work done versus i'm getting the muscle
targeted like i'm supposed to is the
muscle getting pumped
is it getting tension passed through it
is it getting sore is it growing
versus like hey i spotted this much and
someone looks at your legs they're like
oh your legs aren't that big and you're
like i know
but i guess i use my again something
else you know some shit like that
so at the end of the day definitely
within a technique you should be looking
to get stronger
but it's okay for technique changes as
long as you're not excusing yourself
like oh yeah but my sfr is higher
bullshit you know it's bullshit as long
as your safari early is higher it's okay
for weights
to go up and to go down a little as long
as your stimulus fatigue ratio is always
high
and within that specific technique
you're always making small gains
anything bad there james you've probably
been through some of the same shit
yourself
definitely definitely and it's sometimes
it can feel disheartening when you're
doing a lift where you're like oh i used
to bench this much race to squat this
much and now i'm kind of doing less but
at the same time you'd like notice it
like fucks you up so much more
and this is something that you guys have
heard mike and i talked about over the
years we call it individualizing your
technique
so coaching tip when you're working with
a beginner you're working on
mostly hitting their external milestones
like does this look
the right way generally speaking now
everyone's feeling different
right they can't feel internal once you
kind of get to that intermediate to
advanced stage
you might have an athlete who goes hey
you know coach i've been squatting this
way for a long time but i find that if i
move my feet in
just like a little bit more than i
normally do i have to take the load down
but it like fucks me up
beyond comparison so like the the
hard-nosed coach will say no keep doing
it the way that we've been doing it
because it's been working
but you know somebody who is a little
more aware of these factors might say
you know what that's actually a pretty
good trade-off if you feel like you're
getting more quad stimulus and it's you
can do
less sets to get more stimulus or more
soreness or fatigue or you know any
combination of those things
where basically you're saying this
slight modification works a little bit
better for me and i've practiced with it
that's excellent that's that's just an
example of it's uh as long as it meets
kind of the same criteria for external
standards but you can add a layer of
internal
individualization on top of that oh my
goodness now you're on your way that's
hypertrophy training right there
100 well said next up is kj
got it that's a hell of a question
hey docs here's a question i've been
struggling with for almost two years so
i'm 215 pounds at six feet around 20
little visible abs bench around 370
paused that's really good
spot 500 etc etc so i'm not a beginner
per se i also have basic lifting videos
on my channel as references
but i seem to barely recover and even
two sets of an exercise can leave me
sore for two days
i get stronger but sometimes i might
even get sick the next day after my
workout barely able to work sometimes
my fastest switch man ever right no he
gets to that limb a little bit
my diet is perfect even although micros
are balanced um well at maintaining
or even a surplus i sleep for eight plus
hours but my mrv is only between six to
14 cents per muscle group at zero to one
rar on the top week might this be
because i'm very fast with dominant or
might there be other reasons besides
that i can do two by six
four hundred low bar parallel squats and
they give my quads extreme muscle pain
and pumps for two to three days
but doing high bar atg squats four by
ten four by ten
with so low bar squats at two by six do
a better job than high bar squats
four by ten with 326 while still giving
me a lot of quad dom seems to be less
and also less fatigue occurs than only
the six reps
with 16 reps even less even leg presses
of 20 reps going to failure
um going very deeply barely gives me any
dimes at all
while i almost never do it so it's not
like i'm used to them might just
indicate that i'm extremely fast with
shaman or might be something else
entirely it's very very likely extremely
fast
it's the most open and check question
i've ever had on this yeah if you were a
superhero
your name would be like fast twitch x or
something exactly
what's the x4 like it's just the
marketing thing it's redundancy okay get
it
x fine um i seem to have the opposite
promise
you guys had uh to as the guy had two
weeks ago my workout sometimes
even takes three hours because i just
need to rest enough in order to perform
properly especially on squats i do full
body three times a week
by the way with 20 so i can tell you
right now
you should probably spl if you're fat as
fast switches you say you should be
splitting up your training
more than full body three times a week
because your muscles need
to be more individualized because their
systemic fatigue generated from such
fast push muscles
actually not probably massive but
actually massive because your workout
takes three fucking hours i can tell you
that
um with twenty thirty thirty cents per
day also includes my muscle group
working steps which is around half of it
two
to all this i d load after three weeks
every time that's okay there's nothing
wrong with that those are individual
it's for almost all my muscles except
triceps ideals and calves which in that
case might be more slow twitch or fiber
than again just speculation
listen it doesn't even matter if you're
fast or slow twitch if you're healthy
and eating normally and the doctor says
your blood work looks good
because it could be like you're
deficient in iron or some shit we're not
thinking about and then all of a sudden
it looks like your fast which would
really just suck
um it's just really low work capacity so
get good blood work done get your doctor
give you a good clean bill of health
right like james when that stock laces
actually you're really sick
you're dying you're actually just a fat
piece of shit yeah it's like i'm not
fast witch you're like
no you have terminal bones fuck
but is it a fast switch illness he's
like no you're all slow twitch actually
and you were slow twist before it's
fascinating that you're gonna
you're going to win that race um so in
any case jesus christ
so in any case the fact of the matter is
is if you're healthy and everything is
well
then you probably are very fast switch
dominant which means um
you should be tailoring your training to
training mostly in the sense of five to
ten
and then uh maybe a pepper in a little
bit of work lighter because you still
have slower twitch fibers in that muscle
that need a little bit more of that work
um and lower volume lower frequency
you're going to train a little bit more
like a like a high-intensity trainee guy
like
like um a menser kind of guy not exactly
like that but like
two times a week per muscle group i
think is a good idea for you three times
a week
probably a lot for many of your muscles
um so three times a week full body might
not be as great as i would go to i would
start with going
push pull uh or sorry upper lower or
push
pull uh two four times a week so like uh
upper lower upper lower like that i
think would do you better
it would give your muscles more time to
recover and then don't try to drive your
volumes like you're getting great
workouts at the end of the day it's
awesome
that you can do this uh and i it's just
tailored to your body that's just how it
works like my chest is much like that my
chest and triceps real fast which so my
training for them people are like that's
all you did for a chance to make dude if
i do anymore my chest will be sore for
seven days
and then it's gonna have fasciculations
and all this other weird shit
you're you're in a place where you just
have to realize what uh what you're
doing the good news is
if you eat a lot of food and train for a
long time you're probably gonna get
really jacked
yeah i totally agree with dr mike here
and i think within the question itself i
think
he said something to the tune of like
i'm barely recovering right and so
like you already know that that's the
issue the same rules apply you're just
on kind of like one of the tales of the
spectrum of fiber typing and
and stimulative rep ranges for people so
if you find that whatever you're doing
right now
is causing you to be basically flirting
with your mrv at all times whether it's
local systemic or both when you get sick
that's an indicator that you're
systemically overreaching right
when you are cripplingly sore or you
can't your performance goes down that's
usually a local
indicator when you have those same
problems the same rules apply to you
you've got to figure out where
where you're going wrong in terms of
your dosing or indoor frequency and i
think what dr mike
said is a really good suggestion in
terms of that so just just keep in mind
my only point being is that even though
you're on kind of the tail of a spectrum
the same rules apply the same methods in
correcting the problem
apply you're just kind of in a unique
situation
unmute um excellent games all right
this is a real we'll just go through
this one quick it's funny has to be
included
some dude norris
need help you're standing by some train
tracks and can pull an old timey lever
that changes which way the track goes
down on one side
i'm imagining like a dastardly dan kind
of villain
uh and he's like leaning outside of the
train and his handlebar mustache as well
exactly exactly um and he's wearing like
a prisoner
sailor outfit um and
on the other fantastically damn jesus
christ on the other track is a person
who's uh on one on one
track is a person whose mrv is 13 sets
on the other track is a person whose mrv
is 32 sets neither can get off the
tracks before the train goes by who
should i sacrifice
so james and i will each share our uh
independent thoughts
i say that 32am every guy needs to die
because his mrv is so high his life is
miserable anyway he has to train so much
and he's probably slower twitch which is
like come on slow twitch that's that's
lame
that's a good answer i find that uh the
people who's like
say the mrv is 32 cents is usually lying
or doing something stupid
so they also need to die
we're talking as much shit on this one
this is this is
just derailing a liter in the train
example we are derailing right
oh man i love that a lot of people
probably thought like the mrv guys are
gonna pick the guy with a higher one
nope
yeah uh yeah i mean the the faster
twitch guy is probably gonna go further
in
whatever athletic endeavor he's in
anyway sorry that's just how it goes
that's him all right ein brown
what is the difference oh sorry let me
know when you haven't oh we're not
oh i got it it pisses me off that we
don't like i took that thing off
and it's still not the same for us yeah
i think it's trying to customize it to
like us as users
oh gotcha apparently like i'm more
friends with some dude norris through
youtube than you are whatever the fuck
that is
ein brown what is the difference between
being too systemically fatigued and
being beyond mrv that is your total mrv
and not mrv for
one muscle group they seem to be used as
explanation performance drop-off that is
not specific to any one exercise
i wasn't if i wasn't so unsure about
whether or not they are the same concept
i would say the systemically fatigued
bodybuilder
would experience performance dropoffs on
all their muscles while being beyond
your body's total mrv would not present
to performance drop
off and untrained muscle groups such as
someone's legs if they only trained
upper body
so um so it's actually
pretty easy so systemic fatigue doesn't
guarantee that all of your muscles are
underperforming
it just makes it more likely and
actually
the answer here is really easy systemic
fatigue
can be plotted on like a linear graph
like like this
or even just a bar graph like that at
some level
is your mrv it's just like at a high
level
and there's beyond there's so much
fatigue that's beyond your mrv
at some level that's mrv you accumulate
enough fatigue and
your maximum recoverable volume at
whatever volume you're doing so it's
like how much training volume you're
currently doing
plus how much stomach fatigue you're
carrying and then at some point the sum
of those two at any one time
hit mrv and then they go over so
systemic fatigue is just like how fucked
up you are
if you're fucked up enough mrv so think
of it
as actually the easiest analogy in the
world mrv is
your um speedometer going over 100 100
miles an hour okay
um and your uh systemic fatigue is how
fast you're going
so like if you're going 50 you have some
systemic fatigue if you're going 90 you
have more but you're still under your
mrv if you're going 110 you're over your
mrv
and that amount of systemic fatigue mrv
is really easy to define
maximum recovery volume is for a
specific muscle or for the whole body
a little bit difficult to define mrv for
the whole body uh
but uh you can do it if you define it
like that then it's a clear performance
plateau or decrement enough fatigue to
fuck you up that hard james
yeah we kind of use systemic fatigue in
lieu of an mrv for the whole body
calculation which is just very difficult
to do so systemic fatigue is kind of the
next best thing that we can use
and so mike's example was really good i
like to think of it very similar but a
little slightly different twist where
as there's basically an inverse
relationship between systemic fatigue
and whatever it is that you're trying to
do whether it's
individual muscle groups or you're
trying to train for you know rugby
or whatever so basically as systemic
fatigue goes up the mrvs for all your
activities
start to go down now if you're not
training them very hard it might not be
a big deal but the harder you start to
train them the more likely you're going
to hit that mrv cap
prematurely to having a more baseline
level of stomach fatigue
that's usually how i think about it
because
mrv is how much fatigue you're carrying
plus how much volume you're imposing if
you're doing 10 sets that week
which you have essentially five sets
worth of accumulated fatigue
you may think you can add another 10
sets because your mrv is typically 20
but you can only really add another five
exactly
yep so real quick stop look at my screen
do you see my screen share i don't know
how i get some of these goofy ones with
this one
allen thrall d-load weeks are pointless
i've heard alan thrall's a really nice
guy so i'm just gonna go ahead and say i
think that's like clickbait
oh yeah you mean that he's making like
an abs picture and like the long beard
going that's
it looks very click-baity to me yeah
good good for him
um i think maybe i don't know i'm just
speculating maybe he's gonna say like
you're gonna go on vacation anyway he's
like for advanced athletes they're great
but for many people
it was like for personal training
clients like should you be like no they
disappeared to aruba for two weeks fuck
their deload
you know what really sticks out in that
picture is like he's very dirty
why are you so dirty and why did you
think that would be a good time to take
a picture
i think you probably just stone loaded
ah yeah
i would want i would want like a cleaner
picture so i could show off my body yeah
then again i suck
so there you go all right
uh so pico rodriguez
i have to do the squirrel we do
if i don't find it in three seconds mike
you'll have to screen shit
one two three okay mike you you screen
share oh i found it nevermind
at the buzzer all right pico rodriguez
says
would eating at maintenance be
worthwhile for recomping
if someone is on trt or higher dosages
and at fifty percent body fat
wouldn't that fix the mtor mpk problem
you spoke about in lecture two for
nutrition for muscle gain
but this person makes slower gains than
a natural doing
bulk slash cut phases also meta
disagrees with you
i like that ben said you need more
protein when taking steroids not less
he said that protein efficiency argument
doesn't hold up in practice
um protein breakdown rates are so low
compared to mps rates that it's
impossible to offset
which should be the massively higher mps
with lower muscle protein breakdown
thoughts uh it's actually not a feed
efficiency is not a protein breakdown
issue feed efficiency is also an
absorption issue
so there's that um
it's also a partitioning issue how much
protein is used for various functions
and burned off for energy
versus how much can be siphoned into
muscle growth so for the same amount of
protein
that is amino acids in your blood when
you're on anabolics more of it goes to
muscle growth and less to other things
so like anabolics are literally given to
cows trenbolone is given to cows during
the
feedlot moving process when they get
moved from the lot to the slaughterhouse
and that can be a process that takes
some time and they're really stressed
and the food access is limited because
they're in transit
and they don't want them losing a ton of
weight they don't feed them much more
food they feed them less
they give them a shitload of trend and
they don't lose any fucking actual meat
so feed efficiency and protein is is i
think very well studied and pretty
conclusive now of course i
respect the fuck out of meadow and maybe
he's right if i'm wrong however
uh when you transition to doing steroids
the right way
you should wait until you're so advanced
that the same amount of protein
just gets you back to normal gains you
shouldn't be using steroids to get super
crazy psycho gains because then you're
just using them too soon in my view
so if you become if you start taking
steroids when you weigh 120 pounds yeah
you can probably one and a half times
your protein and taken benefit but
you're also
fucking retard you shouldn't be allowed
to access to the drugs
um now let me answer your question more
specifically would eating at maintenance
be worthwhile uh for recomping if
someone is on trt dosages
if they just got on trt dosages yes
after six to 12 months of trt dosages
you got all the recomping you got coming
to you and it's again a difficult
process and funny enough if you go back
and ask
menno meno is against recomping
altogether
so and i agree with him on this and i
think so does james if you get really
great results from you comping why don't
you just put a little deficit a little
surplus in there and you'll get
really good results um i've never done
steroids but if i had an alternate
universe i was
natural 270 pounds when i started and i
was on essentially just above trt doses
and i recomped in this pretend universe
for six months straight
and honestly i didn't get a whole lot
out of it like i got something out of it
i got a ton out of it when i did my
first fat loss phase because i gained a
little bit of muscle
while losing a fuck load of fat and i
sort of thought why the fuck didn't i
just do that to begin with i just pissed
away six months
of decent gains like remember trying to
recomp for most people
unless they're new beginners is a
poorer use of your time than the
alternative or bulky and cutting it's
not a bad use of time
it's just worse it's like saying hey can
we take this clanky car
that doesn't get amazing gas efficiency
on a road trip of course
but why wouldn't you take a better car
that's all we're saying
yeah i agree and i don't think that um
so mike mike nailed all the important
things and i don't think that he
actually said that you need to take less
protein i think he just said that
you could it's an option
um oh that pico rodriguez said yeah
okay i got you yeah not to not to be
like uh you know
no no no totally but i think that was
the thing it was like you could go both
you could go both routes potentially if
you
chose to do so sure sure if i remember
that correctly
i just uh you know they've never really
done research on steroid users
uh i know i know of a few studies which
they've sort of tried
i don't know how well it worked but um
maybe guys on gear
do really use that much protein um
i tell you what like for myself and
folks that i've known on gear
um upping your protein by a shitload
doesn't magically fucking make you more
muscular
like uh it just fucking doesn't uh and a
lot of guys
eat uh fuck time who guys my weight i
ate like 250 grams of protein a day i
know guys my weight eating 400. i don't
get my weight eating 450
and i don't i think they just shit all
of it out like i
they're not anymore it doesn't doesn't
seem that they're much more jacked and i
just don't know if that's true
and i think bodybuilders have this
religious thing with protein or they
just try to eat as much of it as
possible because we're fucking idiots
and this has been something that's been
beaten to death with non-enhanced people
where there's there's just some upper
limit for if you're not using
steroids or any performance enhancing
drugs like there's an upper limit
what that is is contentious but we do
know that it exists at some point right
so to think that that the upper limit
just goes away
for the enhanced athlete it's just kind
of silly is it is it reasonable to think
that the upper limit might go up
or that the lower limit might go down
sure like it's kind of the same idea
with the mrv uh
mev window expanding same idea there we
do see it happening
um but to think that it just is like now
infinity you can eat 500 grams of
protein and keep getting more and more
jack like
don't you think somebody's tried that
don't you think we've
people have tried to do that and keep
trying to do it and it doesn't do
anything like
another thought experiment is the
following
who makes objectively the best gains
beginners
untrained noobs how much protein are
they usually eating when they make those
gains well the fuck they usually don't
eat enough and they still make
better gains than all of us so if taking
steroids turns you more into a noob
well noobs don't need any more protein
and certainly aren't making
i'll put it this way the lower protein
most noobs take
don't stop them from getting noob gains
and when they get much higher protein
they get a little bit better gains but
not much
why wouldn't drug use work the same and
guys remember drugs are not miraculous
yeah if you're pounding fuck loads of
insulin and growth hormone
into grams of gear of really harsh shit
you can gain impressive amounts of
muscle
still i don't know limited by by protein
fractions
but maybe then you can take in more
protein but most responsible gear use
just basically returns you to your early
stage natural gains
in which you didn't eat a whole lot of
protein any more than you normally would
agree all right um ali
alomin he has two questions
so let me know which one you find first
and we'll answer okay
it's orange for me he's doing it right
as in
posting separate questions separately
that's the way yeah
uh oh i found high dots for many
exercises
yeah let's do that one okay why not that
one i say
wow all right why not i love it
um hi docs for many exercises i find it
extremely hard to exceed a specific
number of reps
usually around eight to ten even when
lowering the weight significantly for
example
dropping the weight by 10 only adds one
rep as opposed to estimated four to five
reps using rm calculators
is there such a thing as being bad at
reps yes
if so should i focus on just adding
weight instead of reps which feels
easier
yes or would that make uh exercise more
strength focused and miss the benefits
to higher rep ranges so
you don't have to worry a ton about
higher rep ranges you can just take a
lot more weight off so
here's your take a lot more weight off
the bar
do higher rep ranges because look if you
take 50 off you will be able to do sets
of 20. i promise you
try to get a rough estimate then of the
stimulus to fatigue ratio
if you're like sure what's the name up
there uh in a first question asker
and or whatever second and you end up
just getting really tired and nothing
happens
then you're more fast wish dominant and
you don't ever have to worry about that
shit you just train mostly heavy
but if you still get a great workout
there then you just have to reduce the
weight by
more than most people it's all personal
which is this is why
james and i are not big on hard rules
and big on relative rules
when we say drop weight in order to get
back into your beneficial rep range
we don't ever say like 10 it might be 10
from some people and for some people 10
like you might not do ship
for calf raises for me my 20 rm
and my 15 rm are like
20 like 10 pounds apart
like i can just keep putting more weight
on the machine and i can still do it
with good technique
and the other way to look at it is if i
lighten up my calf training
i just it's like 25 reps even with my
own body weight my calves are just like
bro we're done
it's a thing so be realistic about it
and if that's what you
try the much lighter training see if the
sfr is good and then move from there
if it's not good don't do it much and if
i might just interject here ali i think
a lot of people who maybe grew up doing
sports
and other kind of strengthy activities
find it really hard to push above that
10 rep range
but as dr mike said you you could get
there you just have to take the weight
down and sometimes
it's the ego that prevents us from
exploring those rep ranges now sometimes
you just like fast twitch man and that's
just how it is and
mike already touched on that um i
personally find
that a lot of people just aren't willing
to reduce the load enough to go into
those higher rep ranges because it feels
shitty because you're used to lifting a
certain amount of weight and then when
you go below that you're like oh this
sucks
um so don't be afraid to do that if
that's the case
and if you are fast twitch man which
sounds like it might be the case
um you know like the 10 to 15 rep range
might be your top end
and everything else is kind of your
golden zone the five to ten maybe eight
to twelve somewhere in there but like
the ten to fifteen might be like your
what what other when other people would
do metabolite phases
you're doing 10 to 15 right that's the
idea so don't feel bad about that that's
just how a lot of fast twitch people are
and if you're not that guy then keep
taking the weight down until you can
find yourself in that range
james we're going to go off script on
your screen
abraham lincoln can you answer that
question really quick
yeah so the book that i'm working on
again this is
still very much in the development
stages so this is all very tentative uh
but the working title is
how much should i train number two the
science of sport training and it's got
myself
jacob reed who works for rp is a
longtime friend and colleague of mine
and mike's
chad wesley smith has done some
contributions and of course mike and
many of the people at rp are going to
take a crack at it and make it look tidy
at this point it's very low on the totem
pole so right now we're going through
our author edits i have another outside
person named dr ashley cavanaugh who's
taking a look at it so she's going to
give me some feedback jake and chad are
going to give me some feedback
i'm going to synthesize all that
feedback and then i'm going to be
submitting what is essentially a rough
draft
to rp and then rp is going to look at it
and say
you know is this something that we want
to pursue any further or not so that's
kind of that's just how it works i don't
see why they won't um but that's just
the stage that it's
in so i would kind of guess probably
like
maybe like two years from now something
like that
realistically i mean it takes time yeah
it's just one of these things like i've
been working on it for
you know over two years at this point
already and
it just a lot of it goes through a lot
of it goes through a lot of revisions in
a lot of iterations and
it's gonna be fucking good the shit that
takes time is good and that's the same
thing that you guys are you know he even
kind of set out what's the etienne and
the hybrid book well the reason why it's
taking so long
is because we keep fucking looking at it
and keep and nitpicking ourselves to
death and
even today like mal had sent me um some
of the the edits that she made
and i was going through it and i was
like this is not okay
gotta go back and look at it again fix
this line and this is like
i've read these chapters four or five
times over already right
and we're still finding like one line
where i'm like no the phrasing is wrong
here
and it's there is as any
savvy business person would know there
is like a time cost opportunity that you
have to make
but for us like this is this is going to
be one of our flagship products and we
want it to be
immaculate um because as is
and any of you who are on youtube know
especially like the fucking youtube
crowd people
are like the king of comic book guys so
there's very there's tons of
opportunities
yeah and so like we just want it to be
as clean and as good as we can
that's why a hypertrophy book has been
like a long work in progress and i've
looked at this fucking book like four
times over and
it's just natural to find things that
you need to fix and that's just how it
is and sometimes i think maybe we didn't
do
enough of that in some of our oh no of
course we didn't do enough i did
i don't even read the science principle
strength training because it just jumps
out at me like that is
could be stated better that has a typo
and we're gonna eventually guys we're
gonna rewrite that book
um we're gonna do a 2.0 uh it's going to
be way better but first we've got to get
this one out
um we're close on my perspective there's
there's a glimmer of hope we're at like
the the pretty much the final
going on the final pass stage until it
goes into like um
formatting and figures and references
and all those things so we're we're
right there all right next up
is montes pilipuches
i found the other ali one i didn't know
if you wanted to do that one time
okay ali if you want the other question
answered
post uh next time
oh sorry it sucks that bars aren't the
same
yeah um you know what mike dr mike why
don't you go ahead and screenshot oh
there he is you were there
go back oh fuck damn it
where it's green green m go back up god
damn it ah it was my fault i missed it
all right
are there any potential health risks of
not training body parts equally i only
train my legs and back
if you don't have anything that's
awesome
if you don't have any clinically
relevant
uh asymmetries then no and most healthy
people who train just about anything
don't have clinically relevant asymmetry
so for example
a lot of strong men don't train their
chests they just don't
um a lot of bobsledders don't train
pulling musculature
uh a lot of weight lifters barely train
their upper pull complex like pull-ups
and stuff like that
uh speed skaters don't train their upper
body at all or almost never
and they're all 100 fine muscles being
too strong
almost never causes problems muscles
being too weak can cause problems
i'm going to do a video much much later
because we're so far ahead of the
filming schedule
uh eventually talking about the myth of
imbalance like people are like you
should be able to bent row
x percent of your bench press somebody
literally just made that up
it's make belief um and the
research on strength asymmetries causing
knee pain quads versus hams
is limited there is something there but
it's it's
really unlikely that that's the
proximate cause of pain
so almost certainly outside of really
weird conditions
no you're totally fine james do you want
to sprinkle anything in on there
yeah and just on that knee pain example
that's typically the
the population that's almost exclusively
studied and is cyclists who
tend to have like extremely over
developed quads compared to their
hamstrings and that seems to
so it's one of those things where it's
not entirely clear if that's really the
issue if that's just kind of the nature
of the activity
maybe it is um but it seems to me
that there's no major health incentives
outside of like when you have
like mike was alluding to earlier
clinical levels of like reciprocal
inhibition because you
for example your pec muscles have become
so
tight right or big because you train
chest a lot and perhaps you have a day
job where you're on the computer all day
and you really just start getting
kyphosis at that point
right this is like an extreme example
but it is something that can happen and
that's when you start to have potential
health risks but again like this only
happens
in a very rare subset of people who have
like uh
who are kind of aloof to what's going on
most people will start to pick up on
like oh man i'm kind of leaning this way
or i'm hyphotic or i
have like too much like anterior pelvic
tilt i got like sway back all the time
like you know people just notice these
things and it starts to affect them
before it becomes clinical so i don't
think that there are in a practical
sense there are many major potential
health risks outside of
just being completely aloof
all right patrick
coher long one
with 14 votes
all right mike you take it
yep
boom patrick coher says
hi docs i
am following situation i'm training for
strength my program includes squats i
have a squat 1rm
of 100 kilograms with being fresh the
problem now is the following so what's
on my second exercise each day i train
them which means that when i use a
weight that is 85 of my 1rm in this case
85 kilograms i can only perform on rep
even going down to 80 of 1 by one rm i
can still not do more than two reps
from reading your books i know the basic
strength training should mostly not rely
on singles and doubles or evidences of
three
to five but to achieve three to five of
squats being the second exercise i would
drop the intensity to below 75 percent
one rm
uh so what do i do keep the intensity
high just do a few reps
or let the intensity drop in order to
get the desired revenge of three to six
so i think
in the 70s you're still fine so three to
six is totally fine to do
as a second exercise but if you want
your maximum squat progress
you should be squatting first in your
program because then that means you can
train to your true potential so at least
one day a week
if you really want to get better at
squatting squats should be first because
they seem to take a big hit for you
if they're second and that absolutely
will impede their progress so i think
it's fine
to train them second and train them in
whatever is organically a three to six
rep range
but like if you're training them third
and your three to six was now in the 60
range i would say that's not really
strength training anymore and you just
need to train squats first
or early james yeah um although
like relative effort might not be as
important as the absolute intensity and
strength training specifically i think
as long as your relative effort is good
in that second exercise slot doing you
know roughly three to five sets even if
it's at roughly 75
i think it's fine you can still make
strength gains
and and this please don't take this
in an insulting way it's not meant to be
at all you might find that you might see
your strength
skyrocketing uh if you just do some
higher reps for a little while
uh so you can obviously have a
periodized plan where you're doing
hypertrophy work and strength work and
stuff
but you know at 100 kilograms if you
were my client and you were somebody who
was looking to do
strength sports or strength activities
i'd say you know actually why don't we
not worry about
doing literal strength training for a
little bit and let's build up the things
that make you strong and then
once we're kind of there then we
transition to strength training so
please don't take that as an insult it's
not meant to be that in any way
but that's that's what i would see first
and foremost and then
look at transitioning to strength later
in your athletic career
again all right i mean that with as much
respect as possible
not everyone is squatting you know as
much as doctor mike and certainly not
myself either so
i'm not squatting as much as much other
people um
all right next up nicholas luca
ricciardi oh that's a good one
um mark ripito said the trapart deadlift
is useless because it lacks sagittal
stability
and it is extremely unsafe substitute
for the barbell deadlift do you agree no
i think that's just make believe it's
just like a train
it's like trying to over sanitize
something like it lacks sagittal
stability well like how is it any less
so you're right you know sagittal plane
is like this guy
deals with kind of front to back um it's
no i would say it's no more or less
stable than doing like a squat
in that regard sort of strange again we
don't know
how to what degree he was serious but so
his contacts lost when people say this
guy said something
look people i when i read youtube
comments about what i said
hypothetically in debates i'm like jesus
christ i never said that like israel
says mrv for quads is 20.
you know my god absolutely i think
that's straight up wrong
because how many times have you mike
you're a strong squatter i'm not a
strong squatter but i've been squatting
with uh
what what is one of the biggest problems
you face with squatting for me it's
always been falling forward
right like that is sagittal stability
i've never fallen forward on a fucking
hex bar deadlift
maybe he's saying it doesn't train
sagittal stability like
that oh maybe
but it's like so what
right like not all lifts are the unsafe
part is what gets me i just have no idea
how
honestly if i had a beginner athlete and
if i had to pick squats
or hex bar deadlifts and the major
concern was safety not necessarily like
long-term athletic development
i would do the hex bar deadlift it's
easier for them to learn they fuck it up
a lot less i understand i don't i don't
know where that's coming from
but that might just be an opinion
difference here just just our thoughts
and maybe he's right maybe we're wrong
um you know so you know there's a lot of
stuff
all right last question for today andrew
atkinson
hey docs what's what differences would
you suggest for calories
carbs depending on the timing of day for
training for example training
first thing in the am versus late
afternoon thanks
not a ton of differences it's just real
world stuff so for example
it's really really tough for you to get
a ton of carbs in if you train first
thing
so you can just go faster or have like a
gatorade away protein and be totally
cool and then eat more carbs after
a late afternoon you could just do
classic nutrient timing carbs before
carbs after
a very late evening training presents a
situation
where i actually would think it's a good
idea
people say like hey listen like i
finished training at 10 p.m i go to bed
at 11 what do i do
i think james and i would both say like
you should smash a pretty fucking big
carbon protein meal
because that's just going to soak in
while you sleep and some people are like
yeah i don't want to eat a lot before i
sleep like
you're gonna be missing out on something
if you under feed your body and go to
sleep you're taking
what it should be a pretty anabolic
situation and just
really missing it out on it so that's my
favorite protein after is really good
it's really good no matter what what do
you think i should do you should do this
i don't want to do that
right yeah and then you're like okay
well then you're gonna miss out on games
like there's no way to like i'm like
no you have to eat food after you train
it's a good idea
all the research says that like you
should
try to get in some fucking protein and
carbs afterwards not
you know within an hour's fine but like
if you train at
finish at 10 and then your next meal is
at 8am
good god are you fucking yourself over
don't do that
totally you know i've i've personally
gotten away so i
back when mike and i were in grad school
i would would
really heavily bias people's carb intake
based on their
training time which at the time at the
research the sports science research and
the nutritional research
actually and it still supports that it
still says that's not a bad idea
but then the problem that you run into
is that you are kind of assuming
you're still manning everyone and you're
assuming that they are training to
become
olympic level athletes right when the
reality is you have most people who are
just training for health and fitness
maybe hypertrophy
are they trying to be the best athlete
that they can be in the world
mostly no um most people are just trying
to maintain some level of you know some
kind of balance yeah balance yeah and
like they want to look better naked than
they currently do
right and so what i have found is that
doing a lot of the um
nutrient timing related biases makes the
programs needlessly complicated for
kind of more gen pop people so for me i
might
like kind of load some of their post
workout meals
a little bit heavier than their other
meals but not
not a lot for the sake of consistency
because what's more important is that i
want their diet to be
easy and practical not easy but
practical right where it's like okay i
can
if i have something that's consistent i
can follow that much easier than if i
have
six or five meals that are distinctly
different throughout the day which for a
lot of people is just too confusing and
too much to manage
so for me i don't even worry about that
so much unless they're in like in this
situation that mike gave unless they're
like in the tails
where they train first thing in the
morning or they train last in the
evening other than that it's kind of
more i i tend to make people's more
uniform throughout the day just because
it's easier to follow honestly it
doesn't make a huge difference
james that's all we have for today man
that was good so folks
sorry we did a short one this week i
appreciate you guys being patient with
us
we'll try and maybe pick up a few extra
minutes next week to make up for the
slack
make sure you guys tune in to all of our
rp videos dr mike did a really good one
where he's running for president which
caught me off guard got a good laugh
out of myself we've got plenty more
stuff on the way i'm going to keep
cranking out videos i know mike's got a
huge backlog of videos
yeah we're going to be working on uh
volume landmarks audio book coming up
which i'm excited to do
nick shaw's book i think either got
released or is very close to being
released they're close to being released
so check that out i had a chance to read
through that it's really good i don't
know if it's through rp but either way
you should check it out it's really
interesting it's definitely
got a lot of great insights about him
and his family and all sorts of cool
stuff so
lots of cool stuff on the way dr mike
anything you want to close out with
see you guys for more youtube stuff
we've got to come and pump it out
all right guys thanks for engaging with
us make sure you subscribe and keep
asking great questions
dr james dr mike out see ya peace
