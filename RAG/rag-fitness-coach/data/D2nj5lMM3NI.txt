up last one go
slow slow slow gun
stand up stand up that's it
hey folks dr mike here peter anderson
strength coach excellent weightlifter
excellent powerlifter
he's trying to take a little bit of a
stab at hypertrophy training
and he's already gonna have amazing
technique on everything
as it looks from the outset because he
can do full range of motion
he can get the job done with really good
technique and good safe technique
we're here today in this video and then
actually the next video with somebody
else
to basically apply kind of like a
four-letter acronym set of principles
to our quad training it's fsd
focus and then go stricter slower
deeper if you have trouble focusing and
getting a lot out of quad training
focusing the movement on your quads
which we'll talk about all the time when
we actually do the movements
and going stricter with your technique
slower
on the way down and no matter how deep
you think
deeper peter's getting a little anxious
that is going to mean whatever you're
getting
out of your quad training for the effort
you're putting in is probably going to
increase
we're just going to do two exercises
today and a sum total
of only six sets in our next video we'll
probably only do something like eight
sets people think oh my god i need to do
20
squads bullshit we are going to do
six sets first three sets of leg press
then three sets of high bar paw squat
which he's really good at
he's really strong what's your best high
bar squat 606
606 high bar yeah today we will not be
using 606
because when we peel him out of the leg
press he will be half dead
folks let's get into it exercise no more
leg press then squats see you in a
second
leg press mom did it grandma did it
we're gonna get jack doing it peter's
gonna do it super
full range of motion we're gonna keep
our back from rounding too much a little
bit of rounding is okay
remember the human body is not this
fragile thing but as soon as you get
into posterior pelvic tilt you're gonna
die
that doesn't do that we don't want a ton
of force generation to come out of the
hips
but we're gonna want to minimize it it's
okay if a little bit happens a little
bit of butt week is fine
super depth on the quads we're going to
put our
feet in such a position that we get a
ton of drive from the heels
and from the toes and from the mid foot
biasing too much to any one of those is
not a good idea
and we're going to do sets of oh 10 to
15 reps
with of course one to two maya reps sets
built into that
so he's going to do as many as he can
almost one or two from fail he's gonna
lock his knees out rest which is safe by
the way because again your knees are not
made of fucking paper or glass
and he's going to rest a few seconds
we're going to do another two to three
we're going to do that two or three
times
per set so yes three sets this workout
but it's more or less like
four or five actual sets if we count the
volume as a
number of times failure is come close to
big push
one again strong deep
good slower this one slow go
press rest breathe almost there
almost there lock them out and lock them
out
two and you're done go grab those
handles hard
deep strict big press
last one super slow control
that go right
very good very good very good peter just
asked sort of what our rest times are
going to be
and if you want a technical discussion
we have the four factor rest model you
can just google that and a youtube video
will come up
but basically especially in quad
training
there's so much systemic fatigue so much
cardiovascular fatigue between sets
you don't want that being a limiting
factor when you go into your next quad
set
so what's the rest time between legs
outside of some special training
circumstances which we do occasionally
drop sets things like that
most quad training you should be resting
enough time between sets
to where your breathing is relatively
normal and you feel
like you can push again hard you feel
like your quads are good
your breath is good you feel strong that
can take three to five minutes between
sets on occasion
what's important is that before you
start any new set of quads
you're ready to really work and push
your quads to their limits we do not
need you
to just go through the motions and be
tired centrally or cardiovascularly
quit early and then you don't actually
get quad growth oh the training is
really hard and it's good for
youtube but we need long enough rest to
really hit it so a lot of these videos
you see of us destroying people's quads
they actually have plenty of rest
between sets but the sets themselves are
so fucking brutal and they're brutal
because they're well rested enough to
push themselves
give that some thought on your own
training slow
push go go go go go go go go go breathe
rest
breathe relax one and one and you're
done
go slow
big push yes one more i want deeper this
time
let's make this one real fucking good
slow
deep press go go go
go go
you just gave me a bicep workout solid
solid solid take a break
everyone limps after leg press so you
guys will notice on that last rep
peter went to failure like we had to dig
him out of the machine
shit happens shit happens we're training
zero to one rar here sometimes to
failure it's totally fine these are all
hard sets
luckily i was around so if you're doing
leg press yourself if you're really
really pushing it
unless there's like an escape patch from
the leg press have someone look at it
and someone's strong be there
don't push too close to failure on leg
press all the time because again you
a lot of times you'll be fine in the
scenario like that sometimes you're so
weak and tired the person can't get you
out you have to sit at the bottom
machine
kind of peer yourself out bad news
because he got well more or less about
10 reps total on that set
we're dropping into lower rep ranges we
took some weight off the bar it's now
405 pounds
last set we're gonna do higher reps more
mile rep sets
more quality controlled technical
executions
so that we can have a really awesome
quad stimulus i was like hey hey peter
you ready to go and he was like
i need to breathe more my breath isn't
back to normal
100 i can't breathe right now this is
going to be
really hard you're in this for the
challenge let's do it let's go
right high quality work the fuck did i
sign up for i know you're an idiot
one deeper let's get these done pissed
in style
yes two down
good down
good down again one more deep
rest breathe block it out breathe
four go must get four
depth
one down you have the velocity you got
the fucking strength
go deep again
deep slow that was bullshit deep and
slow
deep and slow go one more and then you
get to rest deep
slow push rest breathe
breathe we got three then we got two
then you're done
let's get it done right all three at the
same time
go there's no punch line slow
up down down
slow up yes
one more get shit together pete let's do
it deep
slow slow big push go
go go go go go go go go go go
fuck let it out let it go i
have nothing to do perfect perfect
mission accomplished
you okay yeah yeah good stuff good stuff
we got one fuck all we ever ask for is
max effort with good technique and
that's exactly what you did
perfect thank you perfect feel free to
peel yourself out at your leisure
i'll take care of the weight oh fuck
the fast twitch weight lifter failure
comes on real quick
it's like every rep looks good good good
and then it's nothing
like i was pushing with everything
[Music]
this carpet feels nice
so peter is done with leg presses three
sets
relatively heavy plenty of mile reps now
it's time for high bar squats
he is an olympic weight lifter a very
good very experienced one
i think he's clean and jerked over 190
kilos before that's a big deal not
everyone does that
his max high bar squat is 606 pounds
that's very very rare some people few
can low bar to power lifting depth 606
high bar is gnarly
you'll see fssd focus
strict slower and deeper that
approach of modifying training and
because he's done leg presses first
means he does not have to load 606
pounds on his back today to grow
we're probably gonna end up somewhere in
the low 300s four sets of
five to 15 reps somewhere okay not a ton
of mile reps here
because once the bar is on your back the
count is on and your fatigue is going up
all the time there's no rest here
we are going to focus on a controlled
eccentric tons of quad emphasis by
throwing the knees forward at the bottom
staying super upright which he already
knows how to do and a full pause at the
bottom each time if you have trouble
hitting your quads
try it like this let's get it done
whoa nice and slow
fuck are you gonna cram are you a camper
right there you go
yeah yeah the second one will feel
better i promise
stay upright yes
[Music]
slow
damn we fucking mutilated you
now is that just am i just not in
like shape nobody's really in shape for
that we're pushing your body to your
limits yeah
it's just damage but the ability to like
recover
yeah you can be in better shape for yeah
yeah but
you're getting a shitload of growth out
of it because you're not used to the
volumes you're not used to metabolites
so you're going to be really
it's like everything is minimum
effective volume essentially yeah okay
because like i was
nervous of not coming back up on that
220 225 sure
slow deep
up beautiful again good job
slow up
perfect again slow
slow yes up
two more yeah let's do it i got it let's
go
slow
[Music]
oh my god flawless one last one
slow oh my god beautiful
d up
rock dump
good job look we managed to lower your
max to five on
five to 275 from 606. two weeks ago i
did 475 for four sets of tech
yeah yeah so notice notice
475 for four sets of time two weeks ago
he has no trouble growing his quads he's
good at squatting he's good at all that
stuff
for those of you folks that have trouble
growing quads but are squatting a lot
you're deadlifting a lot you're leg
pressing a lot and you're thinking fuck
do i have to do seven eight nine plates
on my press
do i have to do five plate squats on uh
to get my quads to grow the answer is
probably not
from doing what focusing on the quads
shifting your technique to expose your
quads staying more upright getting more
knee flexion
and then strict technique and going
slower and going deeper
stricter slower deeper with a quad focus
the total load you have to use shrinks
the stimulus to the quad
grows slow beautiful
up two more let's get this done
right now peter let's go slow
up good keep your chest up even at the
bottom
quads only go slow
slow up pop
[Music]
[Music]
feel better now that i got that out yeah
that's the first time i've ever thrown
up in training
i played football in college i did
crossfit
weightlifting doing double days
powerlifting first time i've ever
ever react in the trash can from trading
and we did one and a half exercises i
like that description
one and a half yeah you're gonna do a
side of ten okay
and then you're gonna walk out and
you're gonna do a set of five body
weight squats with your hands up
but each one is going to be the same
technique super slow on the way down and
pause
one great
two
three
[Music]
four these are gray
five big chests yes
six four more slow
up seven slow
eight slow again go chest don't look
down there's nothing to see down there
look forward
stay upright upright upright upright
upright up
yeah right quickly back up
hands up deep slow slow
slow slow slow
pause up right down go slow
slow slow pause up
right down go slow slow stay up right
slow
up two more and you're
stand up stand up
that's it beautiful
[Music]
fuck there's uh there's puke in that
trash can
or there will be more soon do you want
us to take that uh
and tie it for you and throw it
somewhere super where does your trash go
that distal door down there goes out
there
okay
folks
focus on the quads stricter
slower deeper try that in your own
training and maybe you'll throw up blood
like he did
any final words
i have no idea what hard training is
what you do now
is a whole new realm wow yahoo
