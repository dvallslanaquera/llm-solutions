is the gym a safe place for your
children
tonight news at 11. hey folks
dr mike isratel here for renaissance
periodization as
always today's topic is
what kind of lifting technique can
reduce your chances of injury at the gym
if you are training for hypertrophy
and or strength let's get right into the
meat and potatoes
what's on the menu today first we're
going to define what injury means so
we're on the same page
then we're going to look at some injury
data to see what kind of sports
tend to be more injurious and what kind
less some of this may surprise you
number three we're going to look into
what technical factors
how you execute a lift can increase or
decrease your injury
and number four will be the actual
recommendations of
how to make sure you reduce your injury
risk at the gym without simultaneously
not training hard because that's the
easiest way
or just don't show up and then lastly
we'll look at other gym injury factors
that you really need to be checking the
boxes on to make sure you're as safe as
possible
not because you're a wuss and you want
to be safe for no damn reason but
because you want to be not injured so
you can progress more get more jacked
get stronger so on and so forth all
right
so defining injury injury can be defined
in very general
as the deformation of body structures
this is the most general possible
definition of injury it is not very
useful
the definition becomes more useful as we
go more specific
a sport injury can be defined as the
deformation of body structures
that reduces performance now
in the sport or sets up a later
performance reduction
right like you bruise your ankle during
a run and you still hit a pr
you ran the fastest you ever have but
like the next day your ankles bruised
and it hurts
and your performance is reduced
micro injury is a sub definition
and that's the deformation of body
structures at a very small scale
it's often undetectable it doesn't hurt
it often does not impact your
performance at all
and it occurs regularly in normal
training it is healed between hard
sessions and with deloads and active
rest phases and there's nothing to worry
about
it's just a part of the process so by
definition we're not trying to avoid all
injury
we're just trying to avoid unnecessary
macro
injury the next definition is macro
injury so there's micro injury macro
injury
macro injury is the definition of body
structures at a large scale already
sounds bad
and it is it often is associated with
pain
but not always and it is often
associated with a performance reduction
but not
every single time however if it doesn't
come with pain and or performance
reduction it occurs if you keep doing
what keeps making it happen
or if that thing is still just around
you can partially slip a disc
that's a pretty big deal but it might
present with no pain or performance
reduction
because then the disc is almost hitting
the nerves it's not supposed to whereas
before it was really far
now it's really close might still be
nothing still a macro injury by the way
but that's not a sustainable scenario
and it's very likely that if it's not
attended to
eventually it will hit the nerves and
you're like ah what happened right and
if you get a time machine in your body
the doctor could be like that actually
happened two months ago but now this
latest
micro injury actually pushed it over the
edge right so definitely
we don't want macro injuries we want to
prevent them to the extent that we're
capable of
without cracking away all of our ability
to overload in sports sports
are risky so is weight training but
we're going to avoid all the risk
that we can now another related term
is a meso injury you know micro meso
macro
that's just something dr james hoffman
of rp made up uh when i was
uh teaching a course and he trolled me
about it and it's not a real made up
term but i gotta say what's up to dr
james it'll be our inside joke myself
james
and the rest of you folks on youtube so
meso injury
that's the one you really don't want
right in the middle right between the
eyes
okay so point two
let's take a look at the injury data now
we're not gonna give you a ton of
numbers you can actually look these up
yourself
uh i just made it super simple for you
guys and ranked a couple of
representative sports
on how high the injury risk is
per exposure hour so if you do one hour
of weightlifting versus one hour of
basketball what is your chance for
injury
there's no numbers here i don't make it
too complex you can look these up
yourself
and most of the studies all align in a
similar direction now
almost all of these are strength sports
and weight training related sports but i
threw a couple in there
just to illustrate uh that weight
training isn't actually that dangerous
so
the most uh the least safe sport as far
as i'm aware of in the united states on
most metrics
is cheerleading it's like cheerleaders
are crazy dangerous there's a bunch of
documentaries about this if you're
interested
why that's quite simple so
in gymnastics people only really bound
up or jump or elevate
on under their own muscular power so
they don't ever go that high or go that
fast
in cheerleading basket tosses and
partner-assisted lifts
means that you get to heights and at
velocities you can't actually execute
yourself
and to further complicate matters you're
relying on other people in a coordinated
fashion to catch you on the way down
people in cheerleading regularly fall
from like
30 feet and just hit the fucking mat
there's some shit you
just won't be able to do anything about
all right so cheerleading is an insane
injury risk for reasons of incredibly
high velocities once you hit the ground
tons of instability tons of coordination
problems and
we're going to talk about in a bit how
that makes sense in theory and we're
going to try to make
uh strength training and hypertrophy
training in the gym the least like
cheerleading possible
in those respects get to see what i mean
in just a sec
next just as another sample sport is
basketball okay people always think oh
my god like
people i'm sure watch your training
videos and like your relatives your aunt
is like
oh my god billy that's 300 pounds aren't
you gonna get hurt
like she's never gonna say that at a
basketball game if you play hoops with
your friends outside she's going to be
like oh
dude it's great here's you know here's a
lemonade she's never been like
basketball you could you could get hurt
you'd be way more hurt playing
basketball
more likely than in weight training
weight train is incredibly safe after
basketball
next example is highland games and
strongmen they get hurt quite a bit more
than weightlifters who get hurt quite a
bit more than power lifters
who get hurt considerably more than
bodybuilders okay bodybuilding
is very safe and is probably one of the
safest
hard physical activities you can do and
it's definitely the safest thing you can
do in the gym
notice the pattern here highlandgame
strongman has a dynamic component has an
unpredictable component lots of movement
weightlifting
good dynamic component you're not
jumping off the ground very far
and the movements are very predictable
not a lot of room for error
power lifting even safer i mean really
not a lot of room for air there
there are high forces in power lifting
that are a very big concern
but you're they're so uncontrolled and
so in very you positions you're used to
executing the ranger is not that high
and what does bodybuilding have neither
the very very high forces of
weightlifting or powerlifting
not the dynamics of weightlifting it's
really pretty safe
right so
we can break all these down give it some
thought and come up
with oh about four injury risk factors
that are relevant in technique okay
factor number one is the magnitude of
the absolute forces
applied if you were using a technique
that requires you to lift more weight
for example partial squatting versus
full squat
okay the absolute magnitude of the
forces is higher
and especially if this is applied
to smaller and weaker structures that
are not normally used to take in this
force a really easy example you just
think about in all of sports is
using two legs to jump up as high as you
can and then tucking one and landing on
one leg
it can be done but like you know if
someone had to ask you
hey do you think it's more safe to land
on two legs or one
you'd be like yeah two and you'd be
completely correct
okay really high forces applied to a
really small structure
generally speaking increases their
injury risk to that structure right
as a structure only has so much
connective tissue of such a strength
the more force you apply the more chance
something goes like this and if it's a
really tiny structure and you apply the
same amount of force
much easier chance you don't you don't
hang a bowling ball on a string
that that whole example number two and
these are not necessarily an order of
importance or anything they're all
pretty important
the velocity is achieved and the
velocity to achieve one really is
does take the cake if we were to rank
these would be number one okay
the higher the velocities the higher the
energy transmission into tissue
when you have to slow down sometimes you
don't slow down uh
in accordance with your will because not
only do velocities
when you reach high velocities when you
slow down there's a high chance that you
a higher chance that you're exposed to
ultra high forces
uh and then you'll get hurt like you
know if your velocity if you're running
every time you hit the ground with your
feet that's a ton of force people pull
hamstrings all the time sprinting
don't exactly pull hamstrings all the
time even in weightlifting not nearly as
often right
that's because of the super high forces
involved from the high velocities
now it's also true that the higher the
velocity of the event or the movement
the more chance that a technical blunder
will occur
okay like if you're bench pressing and
it's slow when you start to drift this
way you can correct it
right and it's just not that hard to
guide a bar that's going at a fucking
like
a tenth of a mile an hour or some shit
like how much of a technique blender
could you possibly have you approach in
real time
but if you do something like
weightlifting and the velocities are
really high
there's more of a chance that when you
mess up technique by a little it can get
really out of hand
the ultimate example not in the gym but
in the on the track
is if you lose your footing when you're
doing like a 100 meter sprint
oh holy shit like you could be in some
deep shit if you lose your footing when
you're jogging
like you know you'll fall maybe maybe
not even you can probably rescue
yourself
right number three the variation of
force exposure so
even if the forces are very high if
you're used to those high forces
in those structures and in those
positions on which they're being imposed
your structures and positions are
adapted to those forces and the injury
risk is actually
not that high at all right which is why
when you lift a ton of weight
and your aunt goes billy like what she
doesn't get is that you've been doing
that for weeks and weeks and you're
totally fine in those positions and your
tissues are stronger and you're actually
very unlikely to get hurt but if forces
come out of left field where they're
usually not detected from there's not
really
an adaptation to that and the chance of
injury goes up considerably
right so if you're normally benching
like this and you're touching right here
if you kind of lose a bench press a
little on technique and you go down to
here and you try to rescue it oh that's
a different
set of forces and vectors on the pack
and it could pull on something that's
not used to being pulled on
with that hive of force your chance of
injury goes up right and then lastly
exceeding your normal structural range
of motion this one's obvious
okay like if you land on one leg wrong
and it goes the wrong way
knee you're getting hurt okay so a lot
of times don't put yourself in positions
that uh do that you know if you have
really lacks knees and you're doing hack
squats and you're purposefully trying to
jam your knees out at the hack squat at
the top
we've all seen that leg press video and
if we haven't now we have because i know
you're googling
leg press accident lady knees buckle
back video don't do it if you've never
seen it don't do it to yourself but it
can happen
incredibly rare but generally speaking
we don't ever want to do any exercises
or any techniques
that risk our structural range of motion
from being
exceeded for example if someone's like
hey we're going to do
shoulders let's do dumbbell push jerks
where you get under the dumbbell you
push it up and then
you also do the jerk component and
there's a chance that you can hyper
extend your elbow
right versus if you're just doing you're
working shoulders and you're just doing
nice slow concentric shoulder presses
there's not really that high of a chance
you're going to hyper extend your elbow
because
you know the bar actually stabilizes
both and also the velocity is not that
high so there's not a chance that you
can get into those crazy weird positions
if you're doing lifting in the gym that
all chronically puts you in really risky
positions
you might want to give it some thought
so which brings us to our next point
how do we actually reduce
the injury risk in the gym what
principles can we follow
and there's good news four of them that
make sure that whatever we're doing in
the gym
be it training for strength hypertrophy
we do it as safely as we can without
sacrificing our ability to get stronger
or bigger first never use more load
than it takes to accomplish the task
which almost always means using fuller
ranges of motion because then the
external load is lower
i don't care who you are if you walk 600
pounds out of a squat rack
the injury risk is xyz if you walk
with the same strength same muscle same
everything 400 pounds out of the squat
rack
even if you go lower with it the injury
risk is
less absolute forces matter one of the
most straightforward ways to get hurt is
to use crazy amounts of weight
sometimes if you're a power lifter and
you already going to depth
it's just something you're going to have
to uh uh accept but if you're cutting
your depth in order to use more weight
you don't have to
you are risking injury that much more a
big deal here is if you slip
up in a full range of motion dumbbell
press
you did this you can either save it or
dump it probably no problem
the absolute force just isn't that high
because the dumbbells aren't that heavy
but if you had your friends load the
dumbbells onto you
and you're only doing them from here to
here if you slip up and it goes this way
you might be in some deep shit so it's
not just that the forces executed
normally at any one time
necessarily hurt you they could but it's
if you stumble with 600 in the squat
that shit is going south fast if you
stumble with 400
and you're used to doing it for 400
minutes you might be able to get out of
it or actually just
step forward a little bit and save it
and come up right not a big deal
number two huge control the weight
because we're talking about power
lifting and bodybuilding
gaining for gaining strength and getting
size uh controlling the weight is a big
part of it and you don't get any
benefits out of being crazy dynamic just
not
so you want slower ecentrics especially
in hypertrophy training
consider pausing which is required in
powerlifting in most cases
especially for the bench press and the
deadlift and
you can do a rapid concentric that's
totally cool so you can go super fast on
the way up
but keep it under control not like
dynamic fast where you ballistically
throw the bar away
but and then slow it down towards the
end so on and so forth
number three standardize your technique
your technique should look very similar
session to session to session to session
because this prevents you from exposing
your body
to unadapted force vectors which it's
not used to
okay and prevents you from having small
structure overloading
because sometimes you can be lifting
with larger structures and then you push
the bar
on and it puts a lot of force on one
small structure maybe one side of your
pec or something like that
you don't want any of that if you have a
technique that sometimes events like
this
sometimes you mention like that
sometimes you match like this who the
hell knows your body is like
you know you're really kind of rolling
the dice but if you bench in a pretty
similar way
with some natural variation you're going
to be in a position where you keep doing
that your body's going to get really
adapted against
injury in that regard and if you keep
being in that safe zone
you're sort of good to go right
this also means not just standardize
your technique but standardize good
technique and good technique according
to
injury risk is not heave hoeing the
weight
which means if you heave hoe the weight
and you do momentum and you do cheating
you guys all know what that means and
there's tons of videos on rp about what
good technique really is
in other regards if you are cheating and
you're doing bad technique
you're increasing forces because nobody
cheats to use less weight let's be
honest
you're exposing small structures to
large forces cheat curling
okay you're doing some shit that you
should be squatting but you're doing it
with your with your
bicep tendon bad idea that's why people
get on camera getting hurt doing cheat
curls
um increasing velocities literally cheat
curling increases the velocity of the
motion
and it's not the problem the problem
isn't that the velocity concentrically
is higher
the problem is on the e-centric when
you're super high velocity you're
slowing it down with your bicep tendon
it's like kind of asking for injury and
of course you're risking on a customer
ranges of motion
because if you start cheating you have
no guarantee of where the bar is going
to go because
it's by definition out of control so if
you're doing this and then
that and then this one of those times
you can get into a position your body's
not used to and then and then what right
your
chance of injury elevates not a ton but
enough that if you do it over and over
and over like that you're gonna get into
some deep shit
lastly if you want to increase your
range of motion and if you do you should
watch our last video on
this series which is the mobility stuff
you have to do it slowly
because radically expanding your range
of motion is a bad idea and can get you
hurt right so if you want to dig a
little deeper
when it's in the squad or your dips or
something go an inch deeper
get it uh every week okay every two
weeks
don't just all of a sudden uh go five
inches deeper
it's tough tough day don't go way way
deeper
and oh my god my peck right well why the
fuck would you go
completely on a custom depth all of a
sudden with your normal load or even
with a slightly reduced load
whenever you have a certain technique
and a certain range of motion if you
want to add range promotion don't just
retool your shit and do it all at once
if you do do that incredibly lightweight
and pyramid backup
but if you're using remotely loading
that you would use in hypertrophy or
strength setting
go a little bit deeper every week every
week every other week every other
you know every two weeks or something
like that and then eventually you'll be
doing
much more range of motion keeping you
safer and more effective on that balance
but you'll get there slowly and
gradually
all right lastly can't leave this off
without some other
gym injury factors that absolutely do
play a role that don't exactly have to
do with technique
right but sometimes they're very related
number one fuckery
okay doing dumb shit is stupid
don't do it okay if your friends are
like hey so this cool exercise do you
want to try it no i don't
all right if i'm going to try a cool
exercise it's going to be slowly warming
up and seeing how it feels and doing it
for higher reps and feeling out the
technique and then progressively
overloading it
weeks and weeks and weeks later down the
line yeah who the hell does that
all right don't do shit that you know is
stupid like someone's like hey i bet you
can't cat back deadlift
this and you're like bet you i can
you're not warmed up and like ah you do
it and your
vertebral column shoots out the back
hitting someone in the face and you know
you're gonna have a lawsuit there
because they lost half their face so
basically don't do stupid shit and you
know what that is okay
stick to your plan ease into stuff
accidents are probably the highest
source of actual gym injuries
uh so stay alert for other lifters don't
walk into other people's weights
make sure other people don't walk into
you while you're lifting don't drop
weight on your feet that's really super
common i've almost done that shit about
a trillion times
get a spotter folks get a spotter it's
not that hard and it can save you from
considerable injury
use collars when you have to because if
your weight starts slipping off i've
actually seen someone eat shit like that
before
uh a gentleman was doing like a
bulgarian squat and he wasn't collared
in
and one of the weights started slipping
and then that tilted him and he tilted
the other way and he smashed his thumb
between the barbell and the supports uh
and it
we saw actual bone white bone it was so
sort of trippy
he lived but holy shit i wouldn't want
that kind of injury right
and this is kind of important make sure
your lifting surface
uh and your lifting implement whatever
you're lifting has a high degree of
friction
okay i've seen people squat low and then
when they come up they slip
i see people's feet slip back and forth
on the floor
holy shit is that a terrible way first
of all that can injure you disastrously
because it's gonna tear your groin all
the pieces
and what's dog shit way to get hurt
because you weren't even like doing
anything wrong per se
you just risked it for no reason like if
i don't have a stable surface to lift on
real talk i don't lift i mean it's not
worth it at all
point number three you have a certain
load you're lifting and training of
course you want to train with more
it's important to go slowly and add
loads slowly
if you do rapid load escalation that's
increasing forces
unaccustomed your chances of injury are
that much higher okay
usually happens when you're feeling good
too you squat at 300
easy 315 easy should you go for 330 that
day
i would say probably not can it be easy
do a little lighter session the next one
session after pyramid back up and maybe
go to 325. look
the strength you get at any one time
isn't because you're like
today today this is the only time i'll
be strong enough to do this well if
you're training right
that shit takes like 10 years to get up
to your maximum strength then you have
multiple years at the top where you can
time your peaks and retry and get your
best weights
there's never a time to like now i put
30 pounds on the bar
put 10 and then next week come in and
put another 10. there's no rush
because those times where you shouldn't
have a really easy to see in 2020
hindsight there's hard as fuck to see
going forward right you go to 315 on the
squat and everything goes well you go to
330 and you pull your attitude a little
bit
fuck take it you guys take the weight
like shit fuck fuck like
i probably should have done that right
and they're like yeah probably not like
i should have told myself not to do that
well here i am telling you not to do
that don't do that
ease in and you'll get all the strength
you're getting and it'll just be slow
and steady i know it requires patience
that sucks but that's the reality
versus injury trade-off number four
don't escalate volume rapidly
really good way to get hurt is do a
deload week do very low volume your body
doesn't get
gets used to that low volume and then
you like go poof crazy high volume right
away
ease in so don't add like four or five
sets every session
like session to session to session or
week to week add like one or two
if you even have to add volume right so
first of all don't add any more volume
than you need to
and uh lastly just add a small amount of
volume each time okay
you'll get where you're going you don't
have to add 10 sets every workout or
something like that or just go from zero
to 60
that can get you hurt is very very well
demonstrated in the scientific
literature that's a huge huge problem
and actually a bunch of sports if you
like train soccer players and they do a
little bit of practice a little bit of
practice and you ramp up the practices
tons of people get hurt right away
there's another reason lastly
why people get hurt and that's
cumulative fatigue your fatigue rises as
you train
unless you do off days light sessions
deloads active rest phases when needed
when that fatigue gets a little too high
especially when your performance starts
to crust that's time to back off
if you your performance starts to crest
and you don't start not hitting pr's
you're still grinding grinding grinding
your tissues are accumulating micro
trauma micro injuries from the first
slide
and your micro injuries start to
accumulate there's more and more of them
and imagine like you have like
this is the stupidest analogy oh i know
okay i'm not gonna use that i was gonna
say a piece of cheese but that's stupid
let's say a piece of paper
okay and you have a piece of paper taped
to one thing and taped to another
and you start poking holes in that piece
of paper and you pull the tape how much
force it takes to pull the tape apart
is going to be less and less and less
with how many holes you've poked into
the shit you can poke enough holes
all you do is go and that's it like
sometimes you're training and you're not
really particularly hitting pr's but
you're really fatigued you're really
tired you've been your quads have been
sore and so and so are weeks and weeks
and weeks
all of a sudden you're doing leg presses
with a normal amount of weight at the
bottom of the fifth wrap your quads
something goes you're like oh what the
hell what do you mean what the hell you
haven't recovered in months
you've just been pushing and pushing and
pushing and micro tearing a micro
trigger migratory
micro chairs can't expand into macro
tears especially when they connect with
other micro tears right
like putting little tiny uh holes in
your windshield and then all of a sudden
someone hits it and goes
in one of those cracks where the fuck do
you think that came from right so manage
your fatigue make sure that when you're
cresting in your performance you feel
really beat up
take some time for away from harder
training do some easy training really
really heal
periodically we've got tons of videos on
that come back and when you come back
slowly ramp up in both load and volume
use good technique
to make sure that you're minimizing your
injury risk as much as possible while
still training as hard as possible folks
