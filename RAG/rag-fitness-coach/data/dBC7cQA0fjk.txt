yep yep yep
control
oh that was good
oh that was beautiful
saliva literally came out
[Music]
yo dr mike here and i am humbled and
honored
to be here with trevor fulbright and
izzy navares let me tell you about these
guys
they are the two
hardest training people i have ever met
in my entire
career in sport science
yeah whatever bs fuck that it's true i
swear to fucking god it's true we are
honored to have them this is really the
christening of rpg because these
motherfuckers are gonna bear this thing
is gonna fall down they train so hard
power levels at maximum scott the video
guy and i are going to get radiation
poisoning just being around these
motherfuckers we am i allowed to swear
yet
four exercises today
for push and a little bit of side delts
at the end
you don't have to say shit that's how
serious these motherfuckers i don't even
talk hit it
[Applause]
i've never done a
second one of my favorites
oh
oh you're gonna be able to hit four
wrong with weight
yeah oh this is like filming sex
exercise number one
incline cambered bar bench press what
mind blown trevor insisted izzy's like
bucket why not so
it's a super amazing exercise
to the extent that you have the mobility
for it if you have access to a camera
bar give it a shot just make sure to
depress your scapulae if you let them go
loosey-goosey not so ideal for the
shoulder joints
nice retracted scapula
go as deep as you can no deeper for a
good pause always pause this exercise if
you just rebound out could be no bueno
for the pec tendons and
good range of motion we're going to be
doing sets of
oh
10 to 20 reps probably like 10 to 15 and
uh i don't know trevor has an enormous
mrv so probably like five sets for him
izzy's probably gonna do one set pass
out let's get it done
[Music]
one more
[Music]
that was
first work set he does not disappoint oh
you guys will notice a few things and
some things you won't notice i'll tell
you about because the way editing works
izzy and trevor have two vastly
different volume landmarks like trevor's
minimum effective volume is probably
just above izzy's maximum recovery
volume so even though it looks like
they're doing a similar number of sets
that's all editing that's got the video
guys idea trevor is doing a lot of sets
izzy's doing not as many sets and that
has to be something you do even when
they come out here to do special workout
like this it's not just like oh we go
for stuff for set baby like fuck that
that's how you get rambo or just bad
results so you gotta customize to
yourself the number of sets is always to
your ability to recover and it's never
like oh that's just what's been
prescribed or that's what my training
partners do and that's the first thing
the second thing is you guys will notice
that compared to all the other videos
we've ever done i'm basically not saying
anything giving any technique tips why
because in in both of respects of one
these guys have read every single
fucking book i've ever written or any of
my colleagues second of all they're
knowledge producers and content creators
in their own right they just know shit
they're really smart i just don't have
anything to say because they probably
train better than i do i'm like picking
up technique tips myself so that's just
how shit works i told you motherfuck
these guys are the real deal and plus
izzy has like 10 bicep pains how the
fuck does that work let's do more sets
[Music]
up
lock it lock it
good stop
[Music]
do you want to rest a little longer
okay you let's just leave this stuff
i'll just leave it yeah i want to get a
lot more perfect get at least one set
over 10.
[Music]
yep more one more
oh yeah
fuck
i thought that's what you were doing all
right
[Music]
oh yeah
oh yeah
[Music]
you're all done yeah that's another
wild difference between me and him i
start off with like 205 for nine we're
going to the same rir my last set was
155 for seven that's three sets later
that's like a 25
plus percent drop
that's just how it always is for me yes
yeah izzy's like super fast wish
yeah if i had to take a guess your fiber
type's like the fastest there's ever
been yeah
like 99
scott we're gonna put the dildo smith
press into the uh
the equation
this thing is like worst case it just
generates a lot of youtube comments
we are done
with the incline camera bear bench
cambered bear
bench it swipes at you every time you
come down oh shit so
now it's time for
smith machine skull crusher super set
directly to close grip bench brutality
triceps fusion based explosion
all the good things multiple sets again
izzy's going to do a different number of
sets than trevor harris might do like
five sets he's gonna do like three and
uh
that's the deal sets of 10 to probably
oh yeah 10 to 20 reps on this because
typically you don't go super happy with
spell crushers and then uh they will
have a huge tricep pump packs will be
dead we'll do one last extra special
exercise
[Applause]
big full lockouts
oh yeah
one more
up up up lock it
[Applause]
can you rest for a second oh
[Applause]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
you guys are going to notice that there
are a couple of different styles of
skull crusher area izzy is doing a jm
press style skull so he's going up to
his upper pecs
it does involve more chest however for
him it's more comfortable for his elbows
and it gets an awesome stimulus to
fatigue ratio for his triceps trevor is
opting for the super psycho mobility
version where you go to your neck
honestly if you can go that deep it
stretches the triceps so much it's a
huge stimulus if you can do it highly
recommend that other people go i go to
my eyes or nose other people go behind
they're all correct variations if the
basics elbows in and a control on the
way down or four range motion are in
it's all a variation you can try any
variation see which one you like best
sometimes you like one for a while and
the other it's all right answered
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
i'm
[Music]
oh yeah
go go
more
let's go
oh yeah
full knockout big lockout
yeah
last
one go
good luck
slide out embarrassingly
you want another one
all set yeah trevor you want another one
are you good good to go i don't know how
to do push-ups already
huh i don't know how i'm going to do
push-ups you can always go to the knees
you're used to that at your day job
[Applause]
[Music]
all right
deficit push-ups
and a real simple setup here
for folks
that are pretty strong like these guys
if they did this first in the workout it
could be like
too many reps to really be super
effective over 30 etc
but since their triceps and chests are
destroyed
as evidenced at least trevor's really
kind of dying over here
this is going to be super effective
exercise
full range of motion gentle pause when
the chest touches the ground but not
unloading so you're still loading your
chest and triceps you're just gently
touching the ground to make sure it's
there and all the way up your hips are
going to want to sag on you you're going
to have to start having sex with the
ground don't do that the ground never
consented keep your hips a little higher
so your chest is the only thing that
touches and always full complete
lockouts that's gonna brutalize your
pecs your front delts your triceps and
then you will get bigger and that you
will have infinite happiness
let's get to it
putting that refrigerator thickness to
fucking work
let's go
[Music]
oh yeah all fucking day
oh yeah
[Music]
yeah one more
oh there's more oh yeah
[Music]
and then embarrassingly slide out
excellent excellent excellent i thought
that was there
forget about full rom this is full
bright for rod
[Music]
excellent
glorious
[Music]
go go go go go go
go good god how does he do that
fuck
i would have given up long ago
god damn
i feel so pleasantly useless
training you guys i'm just kind of
watching
this is also the easiest
training i've ever done
[Music]
yeah one more
[Music]
knees
rest a bit move your knees back a tab
continue
[Music]
that's it that's good enough
that is a fast fiber type folks
when i'm done i'm done
good shit good shit
dude you look pumped out of your fucking
mind right i am yeah your pets and
shoulders and triceps like doubled in
size since when you walk in
[Music]
rest a little faster
let's get two or three
[Music]
oh i meant knee push-ups
sorry
oh that's it
that's it good stuff
good stuff
good stuff collect yourself gentlemen
and then we will do shoulders
[Music]
last exercise for today both of them
needed a bit of side delt work so we are
going to do free motion laterals there's
like a trillion different ways to do
this and trevor actually just showed me
a new variation he's going to be using
i've never seen it's way better than
anything i've ever come up with so pay
close attention and
probably
three to five sets here 10 to 20 reps
but we are going to do
my rep match sets which means you do one
set of however many let's say 15 is
where you stop just shy of failure the
next set you also have to get 15 reps
and you take as many rest breaks as it
takes to get to 15 and the next set also
15 in the next set also 15. this is
brutal but for smaller muscle groups
that seem to be a little bit resistant
to damage and stimulus like the
shoulders for most people this can be a
lifesaver saves you a ton of time
magnifies the stimulus like crazy
because it allows you multiple
approaches to very close to failure in
the same set and of course after
multiple sets that's like 12 failure
approaches only in four sets
wow fucking beautiful
good shit
[Music]
yep
yep one more
yep
reach
[Music]
how many you got left four
take your time
two and two
one
speed
[Music]
rest rest rest good 10 seconds
three left
oh yeah
[Music]
rest for a bit rest for me
it
[Music]
go
go
go
yeah slow
slow
slow
all right whatever i would call in
training it's not that's not that
that's none of what none of us do is
that
is he right after you finish the set
just go into failure once yeah
just put the handles down
face into the mirror and do just with
your hands super round laterals to
failure
cool
yeah
yep
all the way
yeah we got another one
go
slow
take a quick second and do one more

[Music]
oh yeah
fuck
let's do the outro i don't know what to
say um
i learned
techniques from trevor that i straight
up didn't know and you're just better
than the shit i've been doing
and then
i'm pretty sure izzy's face turned like
a blackish purple during one of those
super sets and i think it was like first
of all it's insanely inspirational and i
was also like is he gonna be okay i
think that's really the point of
training and this is about as hard as
anyone's ever trained and
that hard is the line between what is
safe and what is psychologically tenable
for a human being to do it's really
blurry
like the fractal nature of the universe
starts to split apart god's got to be
like yo easy easy bros um honored
amazing and uh yeah you guys are here
for a whole weekend so guess what video
is coming uh already today can we say
it's coming later
yeah
fucking legs so tune in with the
motherfuckers do legs that'll be insane
then they're gonna do back you know
backs back i'm sure they'll make it hard
somehow
see you guys next time
[Music]
