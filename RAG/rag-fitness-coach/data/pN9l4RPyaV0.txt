hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
i forgot to say my last name did i
forget my last name
enough about that folks much more
important today's video topic how to
break through
strength plateaus and if you want to
know
about how to break through muscle gain
plateaus
don't you worry that's the next video
we're recording it'll probably be out
like next week or something all right
so strength plateaus how to break
through them
you're in one you're not getting
stronger might be for your whole body
usually it's just one lift at a time
what do you do about it i've got 10
decent tips
to try to troubleshoot here we go number
one
first i know this is crazy the first tip
is to make sure there's actually a
plateau to break
some people many people have told me
over the years
hey man i'm like my squat's really
struggling i'm like oh no like
it hasn't improved for a while like no
it goes up but just slower than my
deadlift
okay well you know not all the lifts are
supposed to go up at the same rate a lot
of that's just genetics
like oh huh like so how much have you
gained in a squat like
well over the past six months i put 50
pounds on i just wanted to
shut up some of us would die for gains
like that so a lot of times
we don't make the beginner gains we used
to and they turn into intermediate games
which are still fucking baller and
steady fucking gains
you're not at a plateau a plateau is
when you don't make any gains
for like a month at least on end okay
because week to week your
shit can go up and go down no big deal i
would say my rule
just general rule of thumb if you
haven't gained any strength
in like one whole mesocycle like you
test you know before
you do a cycle cycle of a month or two
you test after if there's been no change
you can consider it barely considered a
plateau and especially if
you've got a test in the right rep
ranges too because if you did lots of
sets of five to ten you gotta test five
to ten or five to ten pre and post
because that's probably gonna improve
you test maxes
you just not peak for max so make sure
there's a plateau if it's just slower
gains
you can use some of these to enhance
your gains but that's a very different
discussion than
it's just not working right point number
two
huge point make sure your nutrition your
relaxation and your sleep
is inline we have tons of videos on rp
already about what that means
go look for them there's tons of videos
all over the internet tons of articles
we have a whole recovery book
at rp uh recovering from training it's
called you can buy it it's like 30 bucks
or something it's going to tell you
everything you need to know about
nutrition
relaxation and sleep for recovery don't
even
bother with anything else until these
are sorted when i talk to folks in the
gym they say look my strength is
stalling
one of the first things i'll ask them if
i'm being thorough is how is your
nutrition relaxation and sleep and
they're like man actually i'm getting a
divorce with my wife and
i've been so anxious i can't eat and i'm
just like okay anything i tell you about
your training is going to be
relevant because you're not supplying
the training with proper fuel
nor are you allowing the training
processes to execute themselves
in an environment of a high degree of
rest and relaxation
that's how gains happen so what you have
to have is i don't care what your
program is
if you're getting decent nutrition sleep
and relaxation sweet let's talk about
your program
if you're not i don't care what your
program is right it's like telling me
like hey like
uh my race car won't go any faster you
guys like the race stupid race car
analogies i come up with my rs car won't
go any faster
like okay uh what kind of engine should
i upgrade i'm like okay
what's your current engine and say some
kind of our tech v this and that i'm
like oh sweet sounds reasonable
should be going faster than what you
tell me i'm like what kind of tires are
you using well that's the thing like
uh missing a couple tires so i'm only
actually have two wheels on my car right
now
why are you talking about speed are you
crazy get four
fucking wheels on your car and then the
engine matters not the other way around
all right so
really really really big deal point
number three
is not this magic thing that'll solve
all the problems it just has to be
it's it just happens to be a huge
commonality so you watching this video
right now
there's a decent chance you have this
problem because a lot of people don't
know what deloading is
they just don't know that fatigue
accumulates over time and they reach a
situation where they're under the hood
their gains are actually great
but the fitness gains go like this and
the fatigue gains go like that and all
of a sudden they're either plateaued or
getting weaker and they don't know why
the quality of the training is actually
really good they're training fucking
hard they're training right
but the fatigue has just gotten out of
hand look i went through like maybe
five or six years of training before i
even heard what a deload
was i just didn't even know what it was
i would just auto deload backs and i
felt shitty enough i would just show up
to the gym a little less and
i'd be tired so i'd leave or i'd go on
vacation and then my fatigue would drop
but a lot of people are super hardcore
super dedicated they won't do shit like
that
i didn't do shit like that for years
deload because cumulative fatigue is a
huge factor
you may actually fix everything in your
training just by deloading so a lot of
times when people are training super
hard and if you talk to someone about
their plateau
a lot of times it's a hardcore dedicated
people like i'm doing this i'm doing
that i up my volume up a lot
do i say take a really easy week here's
how to do it and we have tons of videos
about how to do load on rp already
check those out they do it and they're
like come back and they just fucking hit
pr after pr after pr they're just too
much cumulative fatigue
give it a shot if you've never deloaded
before it's almost certainly going to
make you a shitload stronger
point number four you want to make sure
that the amount of training volume
you're doing
is your adaptive window between your
minimum effective volume and your
maximum recoverable between the minimum
you need to do
to actually cause robust adaptations and
get better and
it's not so high that it is exceeding
what your body can regularly recover
from and this is totally pointless for
you to do and probably a real bad idea
how do you do that best way to do it is
probably just take whatever you do now
cut it by half do half of what you're
doing a lot less
like half the number of working sets per
week let's say you bench 10 working sets
of bench per week go to five
no joke deload then go to five and
you'll be like what bye that's bullshit
a lot of people do too much especially
in strength and i purchased something
the other way around usually they don't
do enough and strength they're often
doing too much
you go to half the volume and then
you do a whole mesocycle of training
holds a training cycle deal it after
test your strength again by just
training normally if you've gotten
stronger
you're definitely within that window of
minimum effective volume to maximum
recoverable awesome
and then you can try to play around with
that window but fundamentally the
volume's probably not the problem
right on the other hand if you get there
and you
don't make any gains it's not enough
training volume and then you up
the volume a little go from five sets to
like seven sets on average in the next
training block
or next message cycle see how that works
slowly you'll find
your minimum effective to maximum
recoverable window you just have to
because it exists and it is somewhere
but what a lot of people find
is they'll go from like 15 all the way
to like seven and they get the best
gains of their lives
because they've just been overdoing it
some people they'll go
from you know they were doing 10 and
they were getting okay gains or maybe no
gains at all they go to five and those
gains disappear altogether
and then they slowly add more volume and
they notice between 12 and 22 sets per
week they get their best gains
either way once you know that this is a
value that stays roughly pretty stable
through years and years of your career
so once you find your volume landmarks
then you know them and you don't ever
have to make that mistake again at least
in grand style
the reason this is important a lot of
people just don't know how much volume
they need
and it's a big difference value between
tons of people you could be deadlifting
too much squatting too much benching not
enough and you have no idea because you
copied your program from the internet
nothing wrong with that but it's time to
tailor it to yourself
by exploring different levels of volume
and seeing which one is the right fit
for you that gives you the best results
point number five are you building
strength or are you just testing it
okay a lot of people the big mistake
they make is they just do one rm test
all the time we can work up to a single
and sometimes they don't do much else
they do a single and a triple and they
go home
strength is built best with multiple
sets of three to six reps
that's what builds strength so a lot of
times the way to break through a plateau
and this is how people get themselves
into plateaus is they'll test their max
all the time and it goes up just because
that testing is sufficiently voluminous
and intense
for them to make gains then they get
past their beginner period and it turns
out you just need more work
submaximal hardcore grinder reps rather
than just showing off
showing off just not making you good
anymore and i think damn it i've hit a
plateau like
i used to my max used to go up every
week and a lot of times when they say
shit like my max used to go up every
week it's like motherfucker how do you
know that you're you're testing your max
every week like yeah we're not supposed
to be doing that anyway
get away from the testing and get into
the training lots of sets of three to
six reps
and then afterwards a couple months
later you test your max and holy shit it
went up by a ton
because you're no longer just trying
shit out you're actually doing it
the bodybuilding analogy would be like
instead of flexing in the mirror which
if you flex hard enough and you're a
beginner will actually make you more
jacked
and checks your muscles why don't you
actually train train for a while then
the next time you flex in the mirror
you'll be much more impressive
right point number six recalibrate your
relative effort
maybe your training not hard enough
right so your mesocycle should start at
an rpe seven or so not an rp five or six
if i look at your reps and i don't know
if it's a technique only session or a
recovery session or if it's actually a
hard session you have a problem
on the other hand if you're doing rpe 10
all the time and grinding everything to
failure
then you're probably generating a huge
amount of fatigue with a decent amount
of stimulus but the fatigue after
multiple weeks overwhelms it you get
another
situation where you either have to deal
it all the time or you are in a plateau
most of your good training is going to
be uh between rp 7 and 10 with an
average of like 8 or 9 rp
so most of your sets should be hard
challenging but doable
and recoverable so you can come again
and again and again
that takes some wiggle room and takes
some work to figure out but it's worth
figuring out because you may be training
too hard
per set or you may be training too easy
number seven
technique a lot of times the reason your
bench isn't going up is because you're
benching all wrong you're squatting or
wrong or deadlifting or wrong or maybe
not all wrong but you could be doing it
a whole lot better
the thing is don't just try a new
technique and be like oh man
my max went down anything new is
different for a nervous system which
means total output even if it's more
efficient of a technique it's more
effective
could go down or just be the same you
have to take an objectively better
technique working with a coach is a
great idea maybe watching a bunch of
like johnny candido videos or something
is a really good start
getting your technique really really
solid and practicing that new technique
that better technique
for weeks and weeks and weeks and in the
first few weeks you may get nothing out
of it
but then weeks later you're like oh my
shit in this huge wave of games
i was bench pressing when i was i think
16 years old i was doing 225 for reps i
weighed like
160 or something and i was mentioning
completely flat-backed
and this gentleman at the jewish
community center where i was benching
was a competitive power lifter and he
was in a much older guy i was in the 50s
or 60s
his name was bill and he was like hey
like you're pretty talented in the bench
press did you know that i was like
i don't know i'm trying my best and he's
like you know
would you like to learn how to bench
press properly and i knew who he was and
i was like
yes so he taught me how to arch and
retract just a little bit of an arch a
little bit of a retraction
and i at first my bench went down
because it's fucking awkward right you
just want to fucking push right you
don't have to do this like
weird penguin dance but i believed him
i knew he knew what he was doing he
betcha way more than me and
after that first couple of weird awkward
like
bambi newborn deer leg benching my bench
started going up
and up and up and my technique got even
better i got really settled into how to
really pull my shoulder blades and
really push that chest out
holy shit it launched the rest of my
bench pressing which was you know
monumentous compared to what it used to
be
so invest in that time to let the
technique express itself
don't just be like fucking two weeks
later it didn't fucking work i'm done
don't do shit like that because then you
just
calibrate between various techniques and
never amount to ship
number eight hypertrophy a lot of people
that are obsessed with strength
trains sets of three six all the time so
that's one or three that's fine and they
end up just
running out of muscle to improve to
being stronger okay
like a car engine a certain engine like
a v6 there's only so much tuning you can
do
to get power out of a v6 at some point
you just don't get much out of it now
you can always tune it a little better
but then you're getting five horsepower
here 10 here
three horsepower there at some point if
you want it really really fast you need
a v8 you need a v10 you need a v12 you
just need a bigger engine just the same
way
at some point you got to get more jack
bro like if you look at all the best
power lifters
what does dan green say no skinny
champions they're few and far between
okay you just need muscle period so what
you can do
is you take two to four mesocycles which
means like you know
three to six months or something like
that that's a fucking long time it's not
two weeks
right and you gain size by training
mostly in the five to ten rep range
with food in a hyper-caloric state where
you are
gaining some weight because the muscle
needs to be made of shit it doesn't just
come out of nowhere
then after that you take another two to
four months you may come back and
because you're so used to sets of five
to ten you might be temporarily weaker
especially if you're advanced i know
don't hate me don't throw the remote at
your tv screen
wait do two to four mesocycles another
three to six months
of strength training foundationally sets
of three to six reps
you're gonna take that new muscle you
just built with sets of five to 10 over
multiple months
and you're going to make it strong as
fucking shit getting that
muscle to change its architecture a
little bit to become more efficient and
effective at producing force
getting the nervous system to recruit it
better more dynamically more
athletically in coordination with other
muscles
once you do that your lifts are going to
fucking skyrocket
so if you've run out of tricks and you
look at yourself and you're like i'm
compared to the average 100 kilo lifter
i'm like six inches taller
not as jacked looks like you need to
move up a class
gain that weight and all of your
strength problems are going to be solved
can you imagine if someone who weighed
120 pounds was like i want to be the
next eddie hall
so i'm going to deadlift heavy and press
heavy and do viking presses it's going
to be great
like all right you're going to gain some
weight like no
like eddie hall got strong by doing
technique and it's like uh yeah
that helped but for the love of fucking
god eddie hall at his prime was like
424 pounds there's no way to change that
out
so at the end of the day the most
foundational element of strength
is size and if you're really at a loss
for why your bench won't go up
you need bigger pecs and triceps problem
solved
number nine second to last tip frequency
generally speaking the best average
range of frequency to train the same
movement or muscle groups
to get stronger is like two to four hard
sessions
for that movement pattern or muscle per
week okay so
if you're training once a week and your
bench won't go up you're training your
bench and chest once a week
don't be surprised if you're training
six times a week it could really work
fast at some point but it could be
unsustainable and too fatiguing in the
long term
right so if you did the squat every day
program and you got super strong and you
hit a plateau
do less for a while if you've been
lifting once
maybe twice a week for the same muscle
groups maybe you squat twice a week try
squatting three
times a week for a while and you almost
certainly get stronger and then later go
up to four and you'll almost certainly
get stronger and then go back to two to
give the body a break
really good idea to think about lastly
exercise selection if you've just been
doing the same movements
for longer than like six months on end
your body could be really used to them
and they could be getting a little bit
stale
switch up the movements a bit get away
let's say you've been doing low bar
squat low bar squat low bar squat
understandably you're a power lifter
you've been doing that for six months
straight and not another single fucking
squat movement
literally either just do them light do
them just once a day out of the three
squat days you have or don't do them at
all
and replace them with some front squats
or some leg presses or hack squats
and some high bar squats and do those
shifts for two or three muscles on end
so for another like six months you're
going to build those lifts up they're
going to be novel they're going to be
fresh they're going to build muscle
they're going to build strength
then when you come back
to the low bar squat or to the lift that
you got rid of or de-emphasized
it's going to be new it's going to be
fresh and working with a bigger strength
base and a bigger muscle base and all of
a sudden it's going to go back up
really really easy because we all think
that okay i want to get stronger at this
i want to do it really well i'm going to
invest all my time in it sometimes
moving away from it is the best thing to
actually enhance those gains
right and of course the alternate
movements you want to pick them to
target similar muscles and functions
so we don't want you to like stop low
bar squatting and not high bar squat or
hack squat or something like that don't
just do like leg extensions because that
misses 90 of the muscles you're using
in the squat uh make sure it's a very
similar movement
foundationally it's still a compound
pushing movement of the legs in this
case
but it's okay if it's different and
sometimes it's actually the better way
if the movement is getting stale now
to that frequency end not training
frequency exactly but frequency of when
you do the exercise
if your low bar squat isn't going up and
you squat three times a week
one of them is a low bar session one is
a high bar session one is a hack squat
session
you're doing a general good job of
getting stronger and probably a lot of
good hypertrophy
but the nervous system works on practice
and technique is huge in strength
so what you might be able to do is for a
short time maybe
six to eight weeks squat low bar if your
shoulders and everything can handle it
without injury
squat low bar twice a week instead of
once a week or even three times a week
the amount of practice that you do ends
up making you stronger just on neural
grounds
a lot of getting strong is practicing
lift olympic weight lifters don't get a
good at cleaning jerks because they
never do them they do them all the
fucking time
and that's how they get so good at them
in addition to being strong under the
hood
and being muscular real big deal real
good thing to try now you may say to
yourself like there's no fucking way i
can low bar squat heavy
three times a week might not have to be
heavy what you might do is low bar squat
heavy
one day moderate another day and the
last squatting day
you can do heavy high bar squats or hack
squats to get some good heavy stimulus
but still low bar squat later in the
workout at the end
super light just for techniques that's a
three to six at like fifty percent of
your one rep max
not challenging but it'll let you get
into the groove and practice the
movement
so that next monday when you come back
uh back in and you low bar squat heavy
you're super fucking grooved into low
bar squatting because you've been
practicing with light weights which
absolutely works that way you can get
really strong really fast you can forget
about your plateaus
and eventually when you're not
plateauing anymore and you're getting
really good gains
and you're at that cocktail party and no
one's talking to you someone comes up to
you and you're like oh
hello and they're like have you been
making gains in your squat lately
because i follow you on instagram
um i guess i have and all of a sudden
you're married with children your life
is amazing
that's how to find happiness folks break
those plateaus tell me how it goes
comment in the comments below and if you
want hypertrophy plateau breaking tips
see you next week
