strength training made simple video
number two
what is proper lifting technique
let's break it down proper technique has
oh i've counted six requirements let's
go through them one by one first of all
proper strength training lift technique
utilizes the most muscle possible to
generate the most
force possible in positions in which the
muscles are their strongest for example
if you want to bench the most
there are two parts of your pec
generally the sternal pectoralis and the
clavicular
pectoralis now the sternal one is huge
the clavicular one is usually smaller
so in order to bench the most don't just
bench like this you want to arch
and retract to put your sternal pecs
into the best
possible position to generate a ton of
force if you're lifting in such a way
that doesn't put your biggest and
strongest muscles
on the table you're not going to be able
to be as strong
as otherwise number two very related
you want the lift the actual technique
that you use in a lift
to be leveraged to produce the most
force possible
and to lift the highest amount of
numerical load because at the end of the
day strength is about lifting as much as
possible
for example do you get a better quad
workout
low bar squatting or high bar squatting
probably high bar squatting but
low bar squats for most people allow
simply to squat more weight
which is to say over time that will
absolutely make you stronger at
squatting more weight so low bar
squatting is a real good idea if you
want your strength to improve at least
in the short term high bar squatting can
be used
to build up general strength and
hypertrophy in the muscles and lower
body but eventually low bar squat is
really the tip of the spear
another example the deadlift bar in a
deadlift has to be really close to your
legs and as close to your center of
gravity as possible
because that maximizes your leverage
advantage if you deadlift all the way
out here you're going to be deadlifting
a tiny fraction of where you can
so a lot of times when coaches who coach
lift your technique
will move your knees out or move them in
or move your hands out move them in what
they're trying to do is maximize that
leverage advantage
it's an art as well as a science every
lifter is built differently
and a really good coach will watch how
you move and try to pick
a stance a position and a bar path that
maximizes your individual leverage
advantage
number three the technique you want to
choose is not needlessly fatiguing
damaging or unsafe and that's both in
the long term
as you beat your body up or hopefully
less and the short term of like you're
going to hurt yourself doing that
right now so for example if you dive
bomb your squats
you might consider not doing that
because that's not a sustainable
strategy it exposes you
acutely to a lot of risk any one time
and chronically it might be exposing you
to a slightly higher risk just because
there's acute risk now chronically it
probably won't damage structures anymore
but acutely at any one time it's a risky
strategy
another one is what you can call candy
cane deadlifting just rounding the shit
out of your whole back and trying to
like
be born again you know you can lift a
lot of weight doing that the thing is
maybe chronically and definitely acutely
that strategy is
likely to increase the chance of spinal
injury by a small amount
but by an amount that should be
concerning to you as you lift more and
more weight
which is when you see advanced lifters
that are still around
usually they have some degree of
tightness in their back they're not
relaxing their back at the bottom of the
lift and using it concentrically the
whole time they're usually staying
tighter
so that the hips do more of the work not
exposing the spine
to such unfortunate positions so if you
look at someone's lift
and they're doing something that is
effective as far as lifting a lot of
weight
but looks dangerous either from an acute
or chronic perspective
there may be an intervention there where
you change their technique or if it's
your own technique
and they actually get weaker for a
little while because the body has to get
used to new technique
but once it's used to it they'll be both
safer and stronger in the long term
now on the getting used to the new
technique issue
is point number four you need to have a
technique that can be replicated
session to session for tracking to make
sure you're actually getting stronger if
you're moving the bar
on the bench down a certain away each
time sometimes halfway down sometimes
more
how do you know if your bench is
actually getting stronger so there needs
to be an objective
usually determinant of how the technique
looks
if you know the technique is similar
time to time you can actually make sure
that you are getting stronger at the
rate you think you are and you're not
just fooling yourself it's like asking
people who have squad in the gym
how much do you squat doesn't matter
what they say they actually don't know
because they're not doing a real squat
another thing to that last point the
more you practice any given technique
the
better you get at it if your technique
is different every time
it's kind of like going to a different
english-speaking country every single
time
and trying to understand people as well
as possible yeah they speak english in
australia and in scotland
and in new zealand but it's a little bit
different slang and just kind of it
takes a little bit getting used to
if you want to be your strongest you
don't have to get used to anything you
want to be on very very
common ground super common conditions if
you really want to learn how they speak
english in scotland
should be living in scotland for a while
like as long as possible so if you want
to get really really good at deadlifting
if your delt is very similar each time
your body learns how to operate under
those exact mechanics and begins to get
really really good at them
so when you show up to a powerlifting
meet you don't have to play a guessing
game you know exactly what your
technique is going to be and it's
something your body is well practiced at
and really really good at
so that means for the non-beginner
lifter and probably through the beginner
stages this is something you want to
start thinking about
knowing exactly and remembering and
replicating where you put your hands
your hips your feet your head and just
trying to do the same thing over and
over and over
it also means shitty coaches during a
power lifting meet
will tell you to alter your technique
wildly if you miss a lift
real stupid idea because even if your
technique is very suboptimal that's the
technique you're used to
to make a lift happen maybe just a small
alteration of technique is a good idea
and ideally no alteration just a little
bit of psychological input
if you do change your technique do it
slowly and do it for a long time
don't just do it once and be like it
doesn't work of course it's not going to
work the first time you're not used to
it
change your technique for the better and
then slowly watch your weights build up
and
eventually you'll learn that's probably
the better technique anyway because it
makes you the strongest
and safest next point you want a
technique
that is braced and stable the highest
forces are produced
under a huge amount of stability both
for the whole body
and the intra-abdominal region the core
so what you want to do is brace between
you
breathe in big bear down around your
entire abdomen
and what that allows you to do is
produce the highest possible forces and
it doesn't really even matter if it's a
lower body
or upper body lift it works in every
single possible lift
so if you see in someone's squat and
they're breathing out while they're
squatting down
that is a terrible idea before you squat
breathe in
go down come up and maybe towards the
last half of the lift
you can breathe out and yell something
in russian like i like to do
so in addition to that because stability
is huge
you want your feet to be super stable on
the ground
if you watch a lot of really high level
power lifters do their squat walkout
you'll notice they put their feet down
and they'll do kind of like a little
wiggle and a rub
to really set their feet into the floor
a ton critical
because if you're squatting 800 pounds
or in your case two or three 400 pounds
which is still super challenging
you don't want anything to wiggle down
there because that's going to reduce
your force production a ton
your body is concerned with keeping you
safe first and foremost so if it feels
an instability it reduces central drive
your muscles don't activate as much and
then all of a sudden you're missing
lifts that you shouldn't be if you had
taken the time to get really really
stable
it also means your shoulder should be
stable so a lot of times before you
squat
you'll bring your shoulders back and
lock them into place so that's not a
degree of freedom that can change during
the lift
if you're lifting a lot and you're
squatting a lot let's say your shoulders
start to round forward during the
movement good god that throws off all
kinds of stuff
and again the instability just by itself
is a real bad thing
for your body's central ability to push
your muscles and of course your hands
or you don't just grab the bench and go
what you want to do is
knurl in and grab the bar really settle
in find a real comfortable position
that's stable
chalk is a really good idea because then
your hands don't slide great way to miss
a bench press or just lower your max as
your hands start to slide
same with the deadlift some gifted
people with huge hands and fingers
can grip and rip most of us if we want a
big deadlift we grip the bar we take our
time we really settle in whether you use
hook rip or over under
and then you go stability is absolutely
the name of the game
and taking the time to become stable is
a really good idea because like what
matters is you get the lift
or get the reps that you want it doesn't
matter if you take an extra 30 seconds
to set up so there's never any rush
this means not only do you use chalk
like i mentioned but
you can use some good shoes this is
where squatting shoes
and dead lifting shoes come in handy
really really well because
they're not you know i used to train as
a matter of fact i've squatted over 400
pounds
in those like nike shocks or whatever
and i've had a shock
bust out during one of those squats what
a stupid move
then i bought weightlifting shoes and
they have like a wooden heel or i don't
know it's like some kind of composite
heel that's not busting anywhere
and all of a sudden my squat goes up
because it's stable and it grips the
ground super super well
lastly you want to make sure that the
requirements of the lift
are met with the technique so for the
target lift
it has to meet competition standards and
rules if you two things
one eventually do a competition or two
take yourself seriously and have other
people take it seriously at the gym
so if you're training for strength of
the bench don't go halfway down and be
like i just want a bigger bench i don't
care how much you do in competition
because you're joking yourself you're
not actually benching so for a good
bench
make sure you come all the way down
ideally pause come all the way up pause
for a second and then rack that's a real
bench press
most of your bench press should probably
look like that if you want to get
stronger at the bench press itself
now what about assistance lift technique
there's no like bible of assistance work
and how you're supposed to do it but
there are some
hints that we can use to see what good
technique is first of all
good technique must challenge the
movements and muscles that all we want
to improve
so if you're doing skull crushers in a
way that you don't really feel in your
triceps
are you really making your triceps
bigger stronger probably not so you have
to alter your technique
for example if you're skull crushing and
you have a pretty good flexibility and
you're coming down like this
and using your chest a lot is that
really the best skull crusher no because
someone could ask you
what are you using that for is it to
just do another weird bench no it's for
my triceps well then bring your elbows
in and come down to here and all of a
sudden
you're getting a lot of movement in this
joint not a ton in this joint and it's
going to be
more enhanced people do some techniques
in the gym to enhance the strength of
various muscles or they do assistance
work in a way that just doesn't make any
damn sense you're like
what do you think you're training with
that there has to be an obvious answer
now for muscle growth work because
remember you're going to do some work in
strength training
that is just designed to grow those
muscles bigger so then strength training
can make them stronger later
for this hypertrophy work that we're
doing
high range of motion and tension on the
target muscle are key
so if you're trying to get bigger quads
for squatting and you're using leg
presses
full range of motion is awesome and make
sure you feel it in your quads and not
your adductors or something else like
that not your hamstrings because the leg
press is not a hamstring exercise
for subsystem strength work or what was
true strength assistance lifts to bring
up various parts of the strength
movement
make sure there is a proper range of
motion that
actually challenges the subsystem you're
training for example
if you are doing deficit deadlifts
because you are really
weak from the ground make sure the
deficit
is a big limiting factor for you right
let's say you figured out a machine in
the gym
that really challenges your lockout
ability some kind of like pressing
machine and it
really you say i'm doing this for
lockouts if the machine is hardest
down here uh is it in the lockout's
super easy
you're kidding yourself but if the
machine is easy down here and then at
the top it's like holy crap
that works exactly the subsystem that
you want and that's probably a better
inclusion folks
if you follow those six tips for proper
technique you'll be well on your way
we'll see you next time for the next
video
