you think we're playing games out here
you think this is a game go mother yes
again oh touch another one we're going
to build everything out we don't got
much time we got to go go
go yes regrip regrip regrip get your
grip you good more let's go that's
you whoo whoo whoo big farmer has been
awfully silent today real doctors in the
house Dr pack here with Dr Mike Isel
handshake off pece you can see the
somewhat cauliflower ear no that this
this way yeah that's how you know
somebody's dangerous not from the size
of him we are in the gym the real Mecca
Go's gym as well I called those guys
that phone was nobody was answering that
phone there were silent we are in your
home gym the arguably one of the best
home gy I've seen some other gyms the
rock the pmo the whatever who is that
guy yeah we are here to take you well
for Dr Mike to take me through a super
time efficient pushful workout minimum D
style but for real Heavy Hitters that
want to get jacked out there that's you
[ __ ] so you ready to work yes
well hold on Define work yeah uh uh do
you want me to intro the workout can I
talk about or you can you can do
whatever you
want
so you want a big hit decent hit small
hit with
meaningful some kind of hit no hit you
guys want to get the out of here but you
don't have a ton of time the typical
scenario in the real world you would
number one and she's like what are we
you're like I got to go number two is
like texting your [ __ ] DMS and [ __ ]
class she's all like hey when ain't
coming over and you're
like [ __ ] London traffic 20 minutes is
all you got on the gym you got to be on
your way to the next cuz you're a [ __ ]
check of folks cheap this watch out my
man out here doing this [ __ ] think
playing games out here you think this is
aing game totally real in any
case we want a quick workout and we want
it to hit the triceps the anterior
deltoids the chest and the back and the
biceps and what else we else why not Dr
Mike you made be saying to yourself
right now there's absolutely no way that
you can get all this work in in a
minimal amount of time about hours I
mean I need a I need a camping chair
with [ __ ] I need to camp out at the
gym for this sh also how sweet is this
chair it's a nice chair and this is an
American chair for obese campers because
in America even obese people camp
because most of us are obese and lots of
people camp in any case we w't be
needing this chair because we will only
be doing into exercises and to save time
sorry for your fatigue we will be doing
them in alternating superet style we're
going to do a quick little warm-up and
then we are going to get right into the
business first we are going to do a
machine chest press because it's limited
time we're going to do higher
repetitions why Dr Mike doesn't make any
sense because lower repetitions require
more warm-ups to be safe when does that
simply do a set of six without a few
warm-up sets but a set of 25 you just
need one warm-up set to get the shift
flowing and then kind of half the Reps
on the weight to the first set of 25 is
the rest of the warm so we're going to
do that on the machine press another
benefit of the machine press is it's
selectorized he'll have to put weights
on the bar take the sh off amazing as
soon as we're done pack is going to walk
with me all the way to the cable row
setup now I've rigged my own cable row
cuz I like flexion rows you can do this
on any cable row this is just fancy
bonus Point sport sign [ __ ] we're going
to do cable flexion runs for also wow
sorry 20 to 30
reps we're going to give you an
opportunity to warm up on both of these
exercises first then you get like 30
seconds of rest and we go back through
the circuit again and again and again
until one of two things happens either
like 10 minutes
elapses or you die back you're probably
not going to die you only like three
people have died doing this at this gym
it would be cool I died though dope all
or death yeah and I mean this video is
going to doing numbers bro if you die so
tldd consider dying or just work hard
enough to you earn that
[ __ ] my love if I pass away title it
appropriately put it
up then killer War C him let's go warm
up yeah let's do it
what do we start
with please oh T squat
legs yeah like wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait my agent didn't sign for this
so you know we got the old chest press
here and so back what I want you to do
is um the weight there should be good
for warm-up weight but play around with
that seat height and um you said that
you got a little kind of shoulder bull
you wanted a neutral press so what I
would say is actually um if you can lift
your hands as high as POS possible on
the device that why am I saying that if
you put them low really quick just for
shifts and giggles this is an awesome
pack stretch On th stimulus damn dude
your packs are hard as sh yo Hey listen
can we uh do we have to film this video
not can we film another video what huh
but your triceps you notice are very
stretched if you put it up a little bit
now you're getting in tricep stretch the
camera guy right now literally it's Milo
he likes stretching a lot so don't let
him down hello Milo everything's fine
everything's lengthened so um this is I
think a combination that works because
it's not a chest isolation exercises the
delts are stretched pecs are stretched
triceps are stretched wolf tatto check
you're golden is that R wolf it's uh
actually Thanos right and you showed
your age there they did Thanos is a type
of wolf it is a type of wolf Greek wolf
iOS I've seen the documentary film
called the 300 about all of Greek
society now until Gerard Butler took
over yes that is exactly gree I mean
nowadays it's the same we throw babies
in Ms yeah B wolves
six-year-old the class the classics
about 10 reps here full range of motion
quick e quick concentric control
decentric with a gentle pause at the
bottom for that deep stretch and then
big push that's it and just feel it out
yeah
perfect sounds like you're farting in
every rep but that's just how they built
this machine I am farting as
well that's a really cool sounds yeah
right and it sounds very cyborg
like beit
if it was in a public gym you'd have to
do this awkward you know the the social
awkward guy socially awkward guys and be
like yeah the machine is weird right
that wasn't me farting and that's not me
farting and then you [ __ ] your pants in
the middle of an establish
Domin all right let's go establish
dominance over here busy gym today too
many people in
here all right for YouTube's sake let me
move this random incline bench the out
of the way I'm uh intrigued with the the
flexion row yes is it okay if I demo it
really quick for sure for sure so the
flexion
row cuz I like to say flexion Rose for
these flexion
H it
works flexion or extension who are we
going home with after the club um
suppose a bit of both huh I was about
the same can double ding P intended
literally um
why flexion rows and what the are
flexion rows let me demonstrate and then
I'll blab about it in science
terms so again because we're not here to
isolate we're going to take a grip that
is going to just basically get right
outside your tummy if a wider grip it
would hit more back and shoulders but
less biceps we won't push pull on kind
of the whole thing so nice little closer
grip here I'm going to sit
back make sure to make Jewish sounds on
your way down he my back anyway somebody
call my Kindra
practive relatively straight legs mostly
just to give yourself room you're going
to slow and control round your entire
spine hold here for a second and then
you're not leaning back you're arching
up gently touching your tummy and coming
back down slow under control being
stretched chest up to the sky touch and
come back down this exercise because at
the very bottom our torso angle is bent
it's actually a pretty decent lad hit no
it's not going to be pull-ups and [ __ ]
like that we don't have a lot of time
this exercise hits the spinal rectors
obviously it hits all that [ __ ]
rhomboids upper back [ __ ] it hits the
rear delt it even hits the biceps for
and flexers a little bit if you wanted
bonus points for biceps and we could set
this up underhand grip does that
interest you yeah for sure I could do it
I'll change this out no problem and then
you get like decent Lash
awesome rest of action and it's just one
exercise if I had to pick one exercise
for the whole back flexion rooms are
hard to FOC with you should patent that
yes the Dr
micro Dr Mike curl but Dr Mike
everything you want to try this actually
let me get you the red bar so in the
meantime I'm going to ramble about this
workout but in all seriousness we are
about to demonstrate how and just 10 15
minutes max I've done a 30 minute video
Milo wolf my brother in Iron has done a
couple videos including the infam his
like video you all request a 30 minute
like video check it on his channel but
in just 10 minutes 10 15 minutes amazing
workout sure is it the only workout you
should do during your week if you want
to maximize gains probably not but if
you were to repeat that a couple of
times I'm pretty sure that you've been
looking at absolutely massive gaze # no
excuses # besides you're never too busy
# Dr Mike roll all patented and we good
to go look at those
traps why don't you get in here and try
this out underhand grip this time
uh
first I'll let you be as athletic as you
want I would just start standing and
then lean okay fine you're good go
quiet yep heals under the weights make
sure the weights aren't slipping slide
your butt back a little bit more perfect
and then really round up [ __ ] out of
your back cook up and over your
toes pause for a second Big Stretch and
then arch your back touch your tummy yes
and then Big
Stretch yeah can you see the back
working I want you to watch your chest
up to the sky at a top yes very good Big
Stretch big
chest big stret and then chest to the
sky slow on the way down but then quick

of
anyway that was amazing that was really
good yeah and that's the
workout all right guys we'll see you
next time yeah
okay all right let's do it let's get you
some chalk so grip is not a limiting
factor sure we got the chalk Bucket over
there we're going to pick your weight on
the chest press and then I tell you when
I tell you how I tell you uh when to
rest and when not to rest I
think I'll actually like check the time
we'll see how long this takes but I
think the goal is going to be four work
sets and we'll see how pumped and [ __ ]
you get and if you want to do more we'll
do
more it's a deal let's do it deal chalk
chalk stand this is
quite unusual for this type of gym to
have like a chalk bucket it's it gives
me you know Greek or Russian W but I
always want to say Christian Orthodox
Vibes and then I'm like wait a
second it's not really the vibe

loyal sure the light is good in a
t-shirt in a
t-shirt this is what you get yeah
yeah 15 minutes down if you're like a
maybe this was a bit too intense for me
add an extra 5 minutes and you got a 20
minute absolute Beast of a workout yeah
and that's four working sets for all of
the major muscle groups technically but
because we did lengthen partials
man hypertrophic yield wise I'd say it's
closer to like five or six work set
equivalent five or six work sets man
we're getting into some [ __ ] now the
rest times are lower so we're back to
four if we had take taken normal rest
but I'm telling you guys four work set
for triceps chest front dels
back rear delts and biceps that's
[ __ ] serious work that will cause
hypertrophy in a very high fraction of
people and it's also a great cardio
workout so that sweet and the best part
of all you get to drive from BMW to that
part of London head number two but don't
you stay get comfortable there cuz
number three are already taex in that
cell and that's how we do out here and
