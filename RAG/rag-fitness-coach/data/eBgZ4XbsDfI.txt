to be clear i don't actually give too sh
how much weight jeff cavalier can
deadlift um this isn't about criticizing
his strength levels it's just about
promoting
basic honesty and transparency since
this industry is already filled with
enough lies and deception as it is
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and here we are again i'll try to keep
this one reasonably concise because i'm
actually
pretty tired of talking about as well as
hearing about this particular subject
and i really do want to keep most of my
critique videos more on the
informational side with
lots of actionable advice rather than
just addressing
youtube fitness drama but this message
landed in my instagram dms this morning
and since i did do an athlean x fake
weights video last month and i have been
pretty vocal about it
whenever it's been brought up because
quite frankly i've just become
really fed up with all the bs in this
industry after having been
involved in it for nearly 15 years now
and i kind of feel like i've just
hit my breaking point with it um but i
did want to do a quick response on this
so for those who don't know uh jeff
castleberry cavalier
was basically outed by the youtube
fitness community last month
for using fake weights in a bunch of his
videos with the 495 pound deadlift
uh being the one that got the most
attention and my opinion
like i said originally is that the use
of fake weights is
completely unacceptable and just flat
out ridiculous
you know if being a fake natty is widely
considered as unethical
then being a fake uh elite power lifter
is also unethical when it's being used
to boost your credibility
increase your following and ultimately
sell products using fake weights for a
lifting demonstration is totally fine if
you can actually lift that weight in
real life
but if you're using weights that you
can't actually lift you know if you've
gone
out of your way to go online and
knowingly purchase fake weights
with the obvious intention of using
those weights in your videos
to misrepresent your true lifting
capabilities and then your comment
section is
full of people praising you for how
strong and impressive your lifts are
and you're just taking this all in when
it's all a complete lie
that is obvious [ __ ] and it deserves
to be called out especially when you
have
over 10 million subscribers who follow
you in which case you should actually be
held to an even higher standard
now jeff never publicly addressed this
issue even after a bunch of large
youtube fitness channels talked about it
he started censoring all the comments on
his youtube and instagram
of anybody even mentioning it and then
yesterday he uploads a video entitled
how to get big and strong just do this
where he shows himself performing heavy
deadlifts
with what appears to be real weights
this time around now
jeff has always responded to other
youtubers and any type of controversy
in this kind of subtle indirect way
without explicitly saying anything
and so i think it's pretty safe to say
that this video is a response to the
whole fake weights issue
because if he really wanted this whole
thing to just go away
um and to be swept under the rug and
forgotten about then he would not have
uploaded a video of himself
performing heavy one rep max dead list
he knows that posting something like
this
is gonna stir up even more discussion
about it so i don't see how this wasn't
intentional
you know even the way he slams the
weight down on the ground after the set
really just makes it look like he's
trying to prove a point here
and then if you check the comments
section in the video uh the top comment
with over 900 likes
says i see what jeff is doing here
answering the fake weights issue while
teaching like he always have been doing
over the years
good job jeff that's how you shut them
up and put the debate to rest
and then it's filled with all these
other replies from his other followers
bye bye haters you can go home now
[ __ ] yeah jeff you did it i love
how it lets the bar drop with a clang
after the deadlift
then looks at the camera and not regrets
video half
so i'm sure a lot of athlete x fans are
feeling vindicated with this latest
upload where
their hero overcomes the odds and
silences the critics and proves that his
amazing
feats of strength were legitimate all
along but unfortunately
if we just very simply break this down
this video actually does the complete
opposite of that okay if anything
all this does is further cement the fact
that he was using fake weights in the
original videos
and that he way over exaggerated his
actual strength levels and straight up
lied about it
as far as i'm concerned this video here
is actually an admission of guilt
first off in the original fake weights
video he deadlifts 495 pounds for two
reps
now if you plug that into a rep
conversion calculator which isn't going
to be perfect but it's still a decent
estimate to go by
um that equals out to a one rep max of
521 pounds
now you also have to factor in that he
did the reps touch and go style
and it didn't even look like a true two
rep max if you look at the speed of the
bar
it looks like he probably had one or two
more reps left in the tank
in which case the one rep max would be
at least 530 pounds
and not only that but he did the
original lift without a lifting belt
so combine all three of those factors
okay touch and go reps
not a true two rep max no belt that
means that his actual one rep max would
definitely be higher than 521
now in his newest video he deadlifts 425
pounds
for a true one rep max and you can see
that this is an all-out attempt
because he's using real weights and you
can see how the weights move differently
when they're actually real
he's also wearing a lifting belt and the
bar is hitching slightly
so that's at least 100 pounds less than
what he lifted in the fake weights video
with all the factors equated and not
only that but he's not even using good
form okay his technique is straight up
sloppy here
he starts to lift with his upper body
completely bent over and basically
parallel to the floor
his entire back is rounded over
basically the exact things he recommends
against doing
and the exact things that are going to
send you on a one-way trip to snap city
if you do them while performing heavy
deadlifts look at this dude man still
going to snap some [ __ ] up and i'm
serious dude's fitting to snap it
as soon as i lift a weight that's
somewhat more than what i can you know
comfortably handle
if i lose my scapular tightness to the
point where my arms start to protract
out in front of me
which will drag my thoracic spine into
flexion which because the spine is one
unit
starts to drag my lumbar spine
deflection in which i'm applying an
incredible load on my lumbar discs
where boom i can pop one just like that
that's an obvious form breakdown that's
the lack of stability that's an obvious
example of that and from here the only
goal that you should have
is to get your low back in the right
position to execute this lift because
when people talk about the dangers of
this lift
it's because they're doing it with the
wrong positioning of the low back which
can cause
a lumbar disc issue if you don't do it
right chest goes out
hips go down and i'm ready to rock and
roll now the key is i said the position
of the low back
being flat you don't want that rounded
low back
because what that does is it lifts with
the hips
the first move is hip the first move is
hip lifting with the hips throws your
low back into a rounded position
which again is asking and begging for a
lumbar disc issue
guys it's not obvious stuff we're not
talking about swinging a barbell back
on a curl like this or looking like an
angry cat when you're dead
lifting that's just called
piss-poor form now i recognize that
people's form is not going to be
always 100 perfect when they're doing a
true one rep max
but for a guy who's all about you know
proper form
posture preventing form breakdowns
avoiding injuries
and most importantly leaving your ego at
the door we have to understand this one
critical factor and that is
it's not the number of the place on the
side of the bar
that will ultimately determine your
strength
what matters the most is that the true
strength underlying that is built on a
foundation of stability
i don't understand how he filmed this
lift watch the footage back and then
thought it was a good idea
to show this to his audience it's
actually dangerous to promote this kind
of lifting to millions of viewers
um a large percentage of which are going
to be young impressionable guys in their
teens and early 20s
novice lifters who are just going to
hang on every piece of advice that he
gives
so that's really all there is to it this
latest video shows a deadlift
that is at least 100 pounds less than
what he previously claimed
while using worse form that no
knowledgeable strength coach should be
promoting
and in fact you can actually see that
his form starts breaking down as early
as 315 pounds
so just further proof that the original
weights were fake
not that we didn't already know that
with 99.9 certainty
and further proof that jeff cavaliere is
more interested in trying to make
himself
look impressive on camera rather than
actually giving safe lifting advice to
his viewers
because if they actually go out and try
to perform one rep maxes with this type
of form
a bunch of them are definitely going to
get hurt unless as i said before
that this video is actually like an
admission of sorts
where he's indirectly saying okay here's
what i can actually lift with real
weights
the previous weights were fake you got
me here's the real thing
now leave me alone already that's a
possibility too because
jeff seems like an intelligent guy and i
would think that he would know
that this latest video actually proves
what everybody else has been saying all
along
then again he does recommend breathing
out during heavy sets of squats rather
than bracing your core
which is very dangerous advice i mean
doing impossible workouts consisting of
10 sets of 10 reps with 80 of your one
rep max and he does sell
uh bs products like kre alkaline and uh
tubs of protein powder with
22 servings for 60 so i guess anything
is possible here
to be clear i don't actually give two
shits how much weight jeff cavalier can
deadlift
um if his true one rep max was 315
pounds
and he did it with perfect form on
camera i would have infinitely more
respect for that
um this isn't about criticizing his
strength levels it's just about
promoting basic honesty and transparency
since this industry is already filled
with enough lies and deception as it is
so hopefully that's the last on this
subject unless jeff
uploads a pin pressing video later on
