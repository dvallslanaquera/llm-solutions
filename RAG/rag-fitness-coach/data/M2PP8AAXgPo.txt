hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
burialization rp plus rpu
and saturn yeah it's got the rings it's
really pretty
i think it's less dense than water
technically so if you had a huge
ocean somehow it would float that's what
i've heard don't quote me
hypertrophy concept advanced separative
concept lecture number eight
estimating not measuring the volume
landmarks let's get right into it first
we're going to talk about why volume
landmarks are important and they are
super important
then we're going to talk about the long
hand way to estimate them
uh which is really just kind of say
measure them well much more accurate but
takes months and months so there are
some downsides then we're going to talk
about how to estimate
the volume landmarks in much shorter
time frames
these are estimates that come with
errors and we'll talk about that but
they can be very useful
we'll talk about implications for
training and then programming
recommendations
so question why are the volume landmarks
important to sort of know
well you know you could say who cares if
you're training at your maintenance
volume or a bit of effective volume
well hold on a second maintenance volume
literally means no gains so you can
imagine you thought you were training
between your mev
your mrv making gains by definition
and uh all of a sudden you turned out
you've been training at maintenance
volume for
six months one year uh you know you just
didn't gain muscle the entire time what
a terrible terrible thing
right now that's a lot of people
actually find that out the hard way by
really hitting plateaus and saying oh
you know i haven't gained for last year
that sucks maybe if you had known
wearing a volume landmarks you were
earlier that would have really really
helped
right now you know on the other hand
okay so you
should not be at your mv but also if
you're bumping into your mrv all the
time
you're probably not making your best
gains because you're doing a ton of
muscle damage you're getting a ton of
fatigue your
needless injury risk you're interfering
with progression difficult to overload
so if you're training too much all the
time you don't know where your mrv is
you're in a real bad spot
right the short shift of it is we really
need
to know would be great to have a method
to know
roughly where our volume landmarks are
sort of at any one time in any one
session
that would be really really good because
then we know where our current training
is and if we can of course
measure them on the long term that would
make it better but it shouldn't take
months to figure these things out
all right but
the formal way to figure out volume
landmarks is to take months so here is
the long form estimate i'm sure some of
you guys have seen this before
for maintenance volume you basically
keep a
volume for a muscle group very low for
one mesocycle
and then you assess performance pre and
post that mesocycle
and you see if a performance improved if
performance improved and you're
used to these exercises and this is in
the hypertrophy rep ranges
um then you're probably not a
maintenance volume you're probably a
little bit above maintenance volume
because performance improvement
especially on
sort of multiple sets of higher reps if
you improved in that way
then you probably gained muscle already
sure can't rule it out
so what you have to do is then you have
to repeat that message cycle with an
even lower volume and see when you get
to volume uh performance stability
so you can be stable performance for two
miles cycles in a row then you found
your maintenance farm
because if you've been keeping track of
this entire time while i've been talking
in your head how many metacycles we're
talking about at least like four
milliseconds at least
and that's if you get the correct guess
on the first time to get the lower
volume to actually the maintenance
volume so it could potentially be five
six seven men cycles that's a year of
training or something like that
that takes a long time maybe we can do a
little bit faster than that at least an
estimate
what about mev well you keep a muscle
group volume low or one motorcycle
and you see if there's a performance
gain if there's no performance gain then
you're under median you need to
increase falling a little bit in the
next motorcycle and see if there's a
performance game
if there is uh and it's a pretty decent
performance gain maybe you overshot
sorry if you
tried eight sets and you got no
performance improvement then you did 12
sets and you got pretty good performance
improvement
then the next question is okay so my med
might not be 12 sets
it might be 10 so you have to do another
at least one more confirmatory
intermediate as a cycle
uh to try to see if that's the case now
on the other hand you could go to 12
sets and you still have no performance
improvement then you still need to go up
so it's an exploratory function that
requires g at least two probably more
like four or five million cycles to
figure out
not insurmountable but definitely uh a
work
right nothing you can inform yourself
with within a certain motorcycle
certainly not session to session
maximum adaptive volume is very mobile
so it's very hard to pin down what you
can potentially do
is do your best guess at maximum adapter
volume and
go a little under that uh something like
you know 14 sets
per muscle group per week and then see
what kind of performance benefit you get
and then go up to uh maybe uh let's say
18
per week uh in the in the next mesocycle
and see if you get better improvement
right uh and if you do
get better improvement there then you
probably have to go up to 20 to see if
you get even better but let's say you go
to 20 and it's actually worse
improvement
in performance and you say okay uh
somewhere around 18
might be where my mav is right but that
took you three mesocycles
to figure out where your ideal training
volume is and there's also maybe it's
mobile right at the beginning of a cycle
on accustomed exercises
when your work capacity is low it's
actually lower and then it rises slowly
throughout the motorcycle so
even that like one snapshot doesn't tell
us a whole lot we might be able to do
better than that
uh if we measure it more quickly now mrv
is really easy to figure out if you had
a platform or a performance plateau at
incrementally higher volumes
you have to repeat that high volume for
two to three minute cycles for a
confirmation
um not a difficult process but again
requires two or three measures to be
very sure
and if you want to be very sure you can
absolutely use a long way so
there's times when you can use a long
way in training and they actually work
if you're in a maintenance phase just
for your whole body you can do some of
this maintenance work and figure out
where maintenance volumes are at least
begin the process
if you're de-prioritizing a muscle group
it's actually really easy so for example
you put your triceps on the back burner
and you're training uh you know chest
and back and all the other muscles a lot
more
during that time let's say three or four
mesocycles that they're on the back
burner while the other motorcycles are
sorry why the other muscle groups are
getting bigger
you can play around with maintenance
volumes and see where the tricep
maintenance volume
actually is that's totally cool but you
know muscles only come around to
maintenance volume every now and again
most people in most times are training
the majority
technically over 50 percent of their
body at any time between
mev and mrv so it's like uh you know
if you plan on finding out mevs uh or
mvs
uh by you know just being on a
de-prioritizing
phase uh you know you're gonna get
around to it but it might take you
several years to get through all the
muscles and it begs the question of
after several years are your meds and
mv's different and the answer is
probably yes so this sort of
as the knowledge it's accumulated it
already updates itself uh there's
definitely a problem there
um and uh you know
as you train hard the good news is
you'll find mavs and mrvs just through
hard training training between mvp and
mrv
you'll find um your rough mavs by
getting your best results and your mrvs
by bumping into non-recoverable volumes
during your intramuscle cycle volume
progressions
but they're still going to take months
at a time um
[Music]
we can do better than this we can do
better and maybe not better is the term
but faster
right we could get estimates within a
session uh and not months
at the likely location of pretty much
all the volume landmarks uh if we go
about a certain kind of process
the upside is we get super quick data
the downside is it's not nearly as
accurate these are much more rough
guesses
uh however it's much better than blind
guess right so if you're uh training
if you're supposed to be starting a
cycle or mev and you're reasonably sure
you're close to it
based on your estimate using these
methods that we're gonna be presenting
okay that's cool you might be off a
little bit it might be off a lot of it
but you got an idea um it's like using
an old map to try to find
you know some kind of location it's
still a map and some stuff still hasn't
moved right
but uh you know the alternative is to
use no map at all and just sort of
try to find it blind but no not the best
idea in the world so these
these are really good methods they're
not all powerful but they have their
uses of being better than nothing
so first we're going to talk about
indicators
we're going to have methods to find out
immediate
mvmv mav mrv but
we're going to be using certain
indicators about how our body responds
in the short term
not performance which is long term
to figure out where we are in uh our
volume landmarks so here they are
indicators
they are not in order of importance by
the way they just ordered uh
as i sort of this sort of came to my
mind number one is the pump
okay uh cell swelling is itself
causative muscle hypertrophy so if you
have a pump that probably means you're
growing
uh might mean you're growing and
the pump is also likely indicative of
disruption remember that
when you get a pump is when you go
closer to failure you accumulate a lot
of metabolites you really push yourself
you do multiple stats that's all
uh correlation to highly disruptive
behavior that's also probably causing
hypertrophy right just
there's only so much tension close to
failure which is exactly how you grow
you can throughput
and not get a pump the exception of that
is uh for lower upsets
in the five to ten range pumps aren't
super correlated but we have something
for that so the pump
very partial indicator but nonetheless
tells us something right so for
not getting pumps we're probably not
doing a whole lot of stimulus we might
be at mv or lower
if we're getting really amazing pumps or
probably at mav
or close to mrv or something like that
uh perceived exertion there's another
one it's basically how hard a whole
session felt for a target muscle group
like
after a certain number of sets you sort
of ask yourself like how beat up are my
packs how hard did i work on training my
pecs
um you know anything from easy to okay
to like okay i feel it um uh
and then to tough and to like help for
the love of god and i'm gonna die here
trying to train my chest
and um this actually perceived exertion
works really good for all sets and it
works really good for a lower absence
you know
a bunch of sets of eight uh really
really beat you up and really like
you're
you five sets of eight in the squat
you're gonna feel like you have some
perceived exertion right it's not going
to be missed
soreness all right a soreness is not
just a late onset a muscle soreness
it ranges from mild weakness and
stiffness that accompanies
uh that follows after the exercise for
several hours
and then it goes all the way into mild
soreness moderate sort of severe
soreness all the way up to dom's uh late
nights and muscles that last up to a
week and a half after
right so soreness is a pretty decent
gauge of muscle damage it's not perfect
but it's uh decent
and because it's a good gauge of muscle
damage it's also a gauge of how much
effort you're putting into training how
much stimulus you're getting and thus
uh potentially if you're doing too much
or
just enough or just right or not enough
right so we'll talk about how that
applies in a sec
and lastly performance but not
performance over the long term but week
to week
right uh and this performance one is
actually super good to measure as we'll
see in a bit
mrv right mrv is uh was the volume last
week so much that you couldn't require
for this week
how do you find that out well how do you
know you're covered if your performance
is uh down from the usual then you have
a pretty decent suspicion your mrv now
could not be the mrv but it's better
information than nothing at all so
uh just a couple of caveats here uh
these indicators
uh are not ideal to just proxies right
they're not even very good proxies but
they're decent proxies
um how do we sort of do a little mental
experiment to figure out that they're
decent
well imagine a workout where a couple of
things happen first of all imagine a
workout where you got no pump
um you expended no effort basically it
was the easiest workout in the world no
pump no soreness
and like right after the workout was
over you were like i can just do this
workout completely over again right now
um are you really willing to bet that if
you're anything but a true beginner
even true beginners can't say this
actually are you really willing to bet
that that caused muscle growth
because if you are you just invented the
most amazing training program of all
time
it causes muscle growth it barely costs
you anything or nothing at all
you can do it over and over and over
multiple times a day you never need to
recover holy crap you're gonna be mr
olympia like in a couple weeks
right no training that easy is probably
uh
sub mv um maybe at maintenance falling
at best
probably below it right on the other
hand let's say you trained and you got a
great pump you expended a lot of effort
um you got nice and sore not super crazy
sore are you ready to perform
at your best a few days later um if your
diet etc is on point your sleeping is
good
um if this sort of training doesn't
cause muscle growth
what does you know this is probably
somewhere between your mav and mrv and
maybe it's close to your mav
all right and then uh lastly let's say
you got a really good pump but then you
kept training
and the pump went away and you feel
really flat and um
uh you tried so hard you don't think
that you can have a repeat size like
after you guys ever walk away from a
workout you're like i'm never training
like that ever again i almost died
uh fuck that and let's see he had doms
for two weeks straight
um and it took you six weeks to perform
at that level again like just to get the
mental fortitude to keep going
if there's such a thing as too much and
there is
uh if this is probably it right uh can
you imagine doing a workout like that
and the scientists like sort of examine
all your muscles and like actually grew
really well this is your best growth
you could probably do even more and grow
like holy crap we've all had training
figured out all wrong it turns out we do
really need to smash ourselves to bits
in the gym
the good news about that if we figure
out that's true it's actually super
straightforward just kill yourself in
the gym every time you grow your biggest
you know at least it's a linear uh sort
of direction
uh but uh it's almost certainly not true
right so this is probably
too much right it's probably such a
thing as too much so
we're gonna use these likelihoods and
use the proxies to estimate the volume
landmarks and we're going to start with
the maintenance volume first of all
we've got to ground these in research so
we know sort of where to start
right and then we use the autoregulation
of the proxy variables
of the indicators to sort of point us in
the right direction right
um you know if there's like a if there's
a scavenger hunt in a certain city
uh you don't start at another city you
start in that city but once you're there
you're gonna have to have a map for the
cities or
something like that research tells us
that maintenance volume is a very very
very very very very low much lower than
many people would expect
one-third of normal volume that you're
used to training at to get gains at most
in many cases
potentially there's at least one study
that shows maintenance for months and
months and months of muscle mass at
one-ninth of the training volume that
people used to
training with it's crazy think about
that let's say
the average volume you do is a lot let's
say it's 18 cents a week that means with
two sets a week you could maintain
almost all your muscle
that's insane right uh and then with six
sets a week it almost certainly maintain
your muscle
so very very low so
uh then you have to ask the question so
you try one third of your normal volume
because you're trying to
do maintenance volume let's say question
does it get you a pump
does it require a lot of effort does it
get you sore that volume
uh does it have any real impact on your
performance like does it
deteriorate your performance in the next
session does it elevate your performance
next session so on and so forth
and the answer is probably not right
so you're likely close to your mv you
remember close not exactly at it
if your session is giving you a little
or no pump
it's okay to get a little bit of a pump
but if you get like a gnarly awesome
pump
and you're probably stimulating muscle
growth at that point right
if the session is pretty easy okay
difficult sessions are probably so much
work that they call
adaptation not maintenance remember
maintenance is easy
um it barely gets you sore doesn't get
you sore at all and it doesn't reduce
performance in the next session so you
come in a couple days later and you can
do the same session no problem
the conversation really beat you up to
where you're tired for days and days and
days
yes probably enough to cause some muscle
growth right so
basically estimating mv is really
straightforward
if you can check all these boxes or most
of them you're probably pretty close
and then you repeat the session next
next time and same volume and if you
still check all the boxes you just keep
going
if it gets a little too hard then you
sort of reduce volume to keep checking
the boxes
as this slide describes
all right next estimating mev minimum
effective volume
um the thing about growing muscle is
you probably have to have um
some kind of difficulty doing it um it's
almost
built into the overload principle uh and
the idea of adaptation is a challenge
right so you probably don't grow muscle
by disrupting hardly anything
but because it's minimum effect of
volume it's probably the easiest
sort of disruption you'll ever
experience so it's the very beginnings
of what you can call challenging
but the very beginnings of what you call
challenging right it's like um
playing a video game on easy mode you
can just close your eyes and win the
game you gotta try but it's not that
tough right you gotta focus it'll jump
over
this little bridge here i don't know how
video games work nowadays you shoot your
buddies in the face with a
50 cal whatever but you know it's got
auto aim so it's not that hard and your
buddies are you know working three times
slower than you are something like that
so
um how do you know if you're close to
your mvv well you might get a little bit
of a pump but nothing huge
uh the perception of effort isn't too
hard
but it's definitely a workout right you
can you don't walk away from minimum
effective volume and save and that was
the easiest thing i've ever done you're
like okay okay
yeah so you that workout was something
right but if someone was like oh man end
of the world right you're like nah that
wasn't that hard
right um med training doesn't have to
get you sore
but you can at least feel like a
weakness in your muscles for some time
after or even get a little bit sore so
you could do like four sets of curls
let's say that's mev
after the training for a couple of hours
like oh yeah
something happened on my biceps you know
they don't they don't exactly feel
normal like if you woke up
on a day where you're supposed to be
doing curls and your biceps feel like
the day they do after an immediate
workout you're like
oh i don't think i'm healed right
something's wrong here it's not i don't
feel that kind of
power and it feels a little weak a
little stiff uh something like that and
potentially can be a little bit sore
but if you're grandiose or it's almost
certainly over mev
um and uh the volume is way plenty
enough to recover from so your next
session you should not see a reduction
performance
uh easy easy checklist so for example if
you do a crazy workout and you're like
that's mvv or the next
time you come in and you should totally
shut the bed and the workout's way too
hard because you're still sore still
beat up still tired
uh then you last workout was almost
certainly above you know effective
volume
right now uh estimating mav
how do you do that remember that i mean
he's in a range best growth isn't a
range it's not an exact figure
uh but the middle of that range probably
uh
uh corresponds to the best growth
um just sort of uh our easy guess
the way we use the auto regulators in
this case is you're probably pretty
close to your mav if you can detect a
couple things
first you're probably getting a pretty
good pump like uh unless you're in the
five to ten range
and then the perception of effort is
what we really look at but anything in
you know sort of eight reps and above
you're gonna get a really good pump from
mav training
it's pretty challenging it really pushes
you it's not the end of the world but
it's like oh yeah that was definitely a
work that was tough right
if you don't think if you think you can
get maximum adaptive volumes with almost
no challenge at all
then what you're really saying is you
can get your best gains in a really easy
way which is again
the question back to you what's stopping
you from being mr olympia um
number three is that it gets you pretty
weak for some hours
uh but often uh you know you get a
little bit sore
for some muscles and some some muscles
quite sore even for a few days
right so after an emmy v workout you're
like oh you know i feel it after
anything you're like
okay yeah we need some recovery time for
this and it could be only a day of
recovery
but then the hours after you feel pretty
weak and pretty tired or it could be up
to several days right depending on the
muscle and
exactly how much volume you do no
performance reduction in the next
session because by definition because
below a murphy it's enough
uh it's not so much volume that you
can't recover from it but it should
definitely be like okay
you know recovering for the next session
is going to require that i eat well and
sleep on and so on and so forth
right training in mev recovery is almost
like a matter of course like of course
i'm going to recover this is easy to
tell
uh i mean he is like this is a hard
workout like you got to make sure you're
on your p's and q's or else you know
potentially you could
get close to not being able to recover
uh just a quick reminder so we actually
do have some data on this this is really
good
uh james krieger's analysis found that
uh med is
you know in a small sample of studies
that he looked at at least
was around eight cents per muscle group
per week so
something like four to twelve uh sets
per muscle group per week is probably
where most folks mavs will be found at
various times in their cycle
uh and that's a good workout right it's
nothing too easy you do five sets
of leg presses you're not like that was
easy right but on the other hand you're
not doing 20 sets
of various curls and frying your biceps
off the bone so it's not the end of the
world
speaking of the end of the world how do
you estimate mrv
mrv estimation is actually super super
easy it's actually the most numeric so
it's really straightforward
uh recovery by definition means a return
to past performance
and uh if you can perform on pace from
last week
uh you're not over mrv no matter how you
feel so this is actually a common
misconception
that dr james hoffman uh likes to refute
every now and again
because people say hey like i'm sore i'm
tired i think i'm at mrvs okay
how was your two weeks ago performance
in all of your exercises they're like it
was good i hit my numbers
hit a couple pr's like what about last
week the week after that like it was
good
i hit all my numbers i beat most of my
numbers from last week and on average my
performance is just actually better
his answer is you're not at mrv so
maximum recoverable volume
means it's the most you can recover from
any more than that
and you cannot recover which means you
cannot perform right so your performance
has to be down significantly
from last week um if it's down
significantly from last week it might be
a fluke
but if it's down significantly from last
week in two sessions for the same muscle
group
multiple sessions for the same muscle
group then you're probably looking at an
mrv or very likely so for example
let's say you have three chest workouts
a week monday wednesday and friday
last week you had xyz number of sets and
reps this week
on monday you don't match your last
monday's work effort like you're just
not as strong for reps
um when you think fuck fuck fuck mrv uh
not so fast maybe this is a bad day your
girlfriend punched you in the balls or
some shit like that and um you say okay
we'll see how wednesday goes
if wednesday shit to bed again it's
probably mrv right
uh on the other hand you know also
friday unless some weird stuff's
happening that week like
some obvious stuff like you're not
sleeping you're not eating crazy stress
right some kind of injury if for no
explainable reason
you're crapping again on wednesday and
crapping on a friday it's almost
certainly mr being just time to do
something about it like reduce volume
load
take a deload so on and so forth but if
you have an off day on monday
and then on wednesday and friday you hit
pr's again or just
train as hard as ever and perform right
up to par
then uh yeah it's just monday was
actually a fluke and you don't have to
worry about it
right so basically an example mrv
um here as you hit legs twice a week
last week let's say
you do 225 pounds in the squat on monday
for 12 10 86
and 315 to leg press on thursday for
2018 16 14 right
so this coming monday the monday after
you hit 2 30 in the squat and you would
expect like you know well my rr is going
to be lower a little closer to failure
so i should probably get about the same
reps at 230 they got a 225
uh but you hit 10 reps on the first set
instead of 12 then at 744
it's definitely down you're definitely
not performing because someone came up
to
up to you after that workout we're like
hi how'd you do a good workout you're
like uh
no i was stronger last week right that's
not i thought great okay so by
definition you didn't recover from last
week
but you think hey you know maybe it's
just um
fluke right uh sometimes it happens
right so then you come in thursday
you know optimism and you go and put 320
on the leg press just five pounds up
from last week
one less weapon reserve or something
like that and you're expecting roughly
the same reps except instead of 20 on
the first side you get 17 you go 10
8 8 which is like on the third set
that's half of the reps you were
expecting
uh definitely down two in a row and
almost certainly it was time to call it
that's mrv and maybe do something about
a deload so on and so forth
so really really straightforward for mrv
so taking all of this uh together
uh what are the implications for
training well first of all if you use
these estimators
um you can just do a better job guiding
your training from day one
like in fact you can actually use
intra-session guidance for example one
of the things is pump
like how much of a pump do you get if
you get uh if you're trying to aim for
mev you want like a small pump
if you get a small pump after three sets
but you keep going to four and five sets
to get a massive pump and they're whoa
i wonder if i'm over me well of course
you fucking did it to yourself
so as soon as you get a small pump in a
small perception of effort
and think it's a decent workout but it's
not the end of the world leave the gym
right so pump and effort perception can
absolutely
be used in the workout itself right not
rocket science
and then soreness in the days after and
performance in the days after and all of
a sudden you have indicators during the
session and for sure over the
course of a half week so this sort of uh
setup basically allows you not to be in
the dark and it's sort of
every half week you get a really good
approximation of where your training is
in relation to volume landmarks is it
between
md and mev is it between mvv and mrv is
it close to mav or not so on and so
forth this is a really really good thing
um so you know when you're trying to
train an mv use the rating scale to
raise a lower volume every session to
try to get close to mv
by what the rating scale says if you're
starting most of your messages at mev
which is usually where you start most of
your mesos
um you got to make sure you're not too
high or too low for the first two
several weeks
and uh this is where uh doing the rating
uh perceived exertion and the pump
indication during the session really
really helps like
you come in you've got some new
exercises you're not so sure what your
media is with them
and you say okay i'm going to do like
three to five sets total for
chest today i don't know where mb is
we'll find out let's say after three
sets you got no pump and you
barely feel like you worked that's
probably not any v so you do another set
and after four sides you're looking at a
little bit of a pump feel like i did
something okay you stop at four
but on the other hand you might get to
two sets and be like wow i feel like i'm
really doing some stuff and i'm starting
to build up a pretty good pump here
uh it's time to cut it off seems like
media is really low for two and it
depends on exercise and a bunch of other
factors right
um after you do an mvv
most of your sessions for the rest of
the motorcycle should really just check
pretty close to the mav box like you're
getting really good pumps you're getting
a little bit sore maybe just a little
twinge of you know weakness and so on
and so forth
your perceived exertion is like pretty
pretty pretty good but not the end of
the world like
that's where most hypertrophy comes from
is sequenced workouts like that
right and then memory detection is real
straightforward if you're
underperforming
at any point two times or three times
sequentially in the same week
it's time to cut it off recycle uh rinse
and repeat
and that's it so these are really really
cool estimators i um
good luck using them remember they're
not perfect but they're better than
nothing
folks that's it for this time let's see
what we're talking about next time
it is progression within
a mesocycle
