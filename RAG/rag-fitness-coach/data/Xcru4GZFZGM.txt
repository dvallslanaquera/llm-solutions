hey folks dr michael cartell here for rp
plus rpu renaissance periodization
and the world really i'm here on behalf
of the whole world
so attention aliens watching this this
is
hypertrophy advanced hypertrophy concept
lecture number five
hypertrophy stimuli so what are we
talking about today
we're going to talk about the exact
hypertrophy stimuli like what is it that
actually in a mechanical and a chemical
uh
at a causative level uh leads to muscle
growth
makes muscle growth happen not just like
training but
what is training doing to the muscle
that causes growth to occur
all right so a pretty deep question uh
the first thing we're gonna talk about
is what is the concern why do we want to
know this question so precisely
um then we're gonna talk about uh what
the candidates are for these mechanisms
they're going to be three tension
metabolites and self-swelling
then we're going to finish off by
talking about the implications for
training
and programming recommendations so
what is the concern over wanting to know
exactly what the hypertrophic stimuli
are right first thing we already know
hard training works
okay as a matter of fact we know even
better than that we know that sets of 5
reps to 30 reps close to failure
provide roughly equivalent growth over
the medium term
so who cares how that happens we have a
template to follow
uh why not follow it well uh
we can have really good training just
not knowing a whole lot about what
happens at a mechanistic level
but we can probably have better training
if we do figure out what's going on
uh one of two ways one are trying to get
better in the positive direction
that is we can have training that is
better than it is today because we find
out exactly how to stimulate muscle
growth
and another way is that training can get
better by essentially
curtailing or chopping off the kind of
training that's probably not the best
idea
because it's found out that that doesn't
really stimulate a whole lot of direct
growth mechanisms
right so if only if we know those direct
growth mechanisms can we
pair off training like that to make it
uh not only to make it more powerful in
a direction that works but to take the
chaff off so to speak
and then have a more sleek training
design where you can have a program that
says okay
uh this is my program and every single
part of my program grows muscle
and then no one can say what about this
thing you're doing you're like i don't
know maybe that i don't know what it
does if you really know
why training is caused then why muscle
growth is caused and how
you can have a perfectly efficient or
very close training program which is
awesome
right so um
for example if we really really know how
training works
if peak tension happens to be very
unimportant
the peak tension is the most force
developed by the whole muscle
at any point during lifting it's the
highest peak tension you can possibly
generate is your one repetition max
just as much as you could push at one
moment of time it could be just for
a second or two right some people think
that p-tension is important for
hypertrophy some people think it's not
i'm not really so sure
so if it turns out the peak tension is
just really unimportant
that as long as you have some minimum
tension maybe like a 30 percent of your
one rep max something you do like 30 or
40 reps
if that causes relatively equivalent
growth to something that is a ton of
peak tension
um question is why would you do sets of
10 or less
right a lot of people myself included do
sets
of five to ten reps because we think
there may be something uniquely
beneficial
about a higher degree of peak tension
maybe for some muscle fibers and some
muscle groups and so on and so forth
uh but gee you know we have to admit
that sets of five to ten
are uniquely probabilistic in their
injurious nature
they they more likely to get you hurt
okay you don't step under your
you know a weight you're gonna do for
three sets of six and think ah i'll be
fine
you're like ah good god i i sure hope i
don't break in half especially for
squats
deadlift bench presses overhead presses
that stuff gets you hurt man
what about sets of like 12 what about
sets of 24 you know
if you get hurt doing a set of 24 you
basically just had it coming
right there's nothing you can do in a
set of 24 except for wild technique
alterations and just insanity
it's going to get you hurt it's just
such a low force who gets hurt walking
up and down hill
nobody right you got to slip for that to
happen higher forces have to happen
so if it turns out the peak tension is
not very important we find this out
through this kind of exploration
of what exactly rose muscle then uh you
know maybe we'll just never really do
anything less than 10 reps and that
would be great
and then we see somebody at the gym
that's trying to get jacked and we say
hey why are you doing those sets of six
and they say oh you know it grows muscle
and we can say like no it doesn't idiot
you know and you're over here just
trying to get hurt
but we already know like sets of like
two or three don't uniquely grow any
muscle
and most people in bodybuilding are
hypertrophy circles they don't train
like that anymore
it used to be people did and say well
you know you got to get strong and get
big but we already know that's probably
not true
so maybe we can push it even further and
say you know anything less than 15 or
anything less than 20 reps
is a stupid idea uh and there might be
something to that now we don't know that
yet which is why we're sort of
investigating
uh another one if metabolites are more
important than we think
um then maybe chasing them is a really
good idea if it turns out that
you know all the way like you know
training close to failure training super
heavy
uh all that stuff that grows muscle if
it turns out that it's just generating
metabolites inside the cell
and maybe some of them that leak outside
the muscle cell to other cells if that's
what actually causes muscle growth for
the most part which is actually a
possibility
uh then g chasing them is a real good
idea then you you know
sessions that give you the burn are
probably real up there on the list of
things you should be doing to grow
and if you're not getting a burn
consistently in training somebody could
say like oh look you're missing out on
at least a very big part of the picture
right so maybe that's the case
and uh let's say that the pump uh
the muscle pump is one of our candidates
here uh cell swelling let's say it
actually causes like a pretty decent
amount of growth
well uh then tracking it uh
and training to it is probably a good
idea so you can do a workout and you get
like not so great a pump
you can say to yourself you know i need
to change this workout somehow probably
doing more stuff or different rep range
in order to get a good pump next time
once you have good pumps you know you're
well on your way
um on the other hand if this is not the
case then it's really stupid to go after
pumps
when they might have just nothing to do
with growth whatsoever right it turns
out
maybe the pump is just a total just red
herring and someone's like hey i got a
good pump and you're like okay so and
they're like well it grows muscle like
no it doesn't
shift uh that maybe doesn't even
correlate with muscle growth
so knowing these exact concepts is a
really really good idea
because listen we can already do good
training right so you don't need to
subscribe to rp plus if you want to do
good training
if you want to do your best training you
got to think we got to think a little
harder about these things
get down really deep to the mechanisms
and in this lecture we're going to get
down to mechanisms
we at least know something about for the
time being to see how muscle growth
might actually occur
that's where we get to our training
growth candidates
uh as of this presentation which is in
october 2019
uh we have three really good candidates
for muscle growth a bunch of other
really small ones that we're not really
sure about
uh but for now three were good
candidates in the research and
theoretical development
that also intersect very well with what
people actually do in the gym this is
always some quirky candidates in
research
and things we people do in the gym that
don't make any damn sense uh
in between each other but these are so
are real three heavy hitters
tension uh metabolites generation and
cell swelling so we'll go through all
three of them in a bit
really in depth one of the most deep
dives on this you'll hear probably on
the internet
and try to figure some stuff out of
course they may very well be other
um causes of growth damage comes to mind
is potentially a cause maybe not
stress of some sort a lot of times that
signal through metabolites but maybe
it's not
in all cases uh but these the one ones
have the most evidence for them and they
also explain most of the variance in
other words if
uh you know we already have an rp as
sort of an integrated theory of
hypertrophy that
uh includes tension metabolites and cell
swelling and it seems to be that
that theory currently uh maybe just by
sheer accident
uh seems to explain most of the variants
in hypertrophy training there's not
someone out there getting big without
applying tension metabolites or
self-swelling
uh probably applying several of them at
the same time so it seems that they're
good enough to explain most of the
variants which does not necessarily mean
that they're completely inclusive but at
least a very very good start
and of course we're always going to look
out for research new theoretical
developments new observations by
athletes
that maybe uh add one a little situation
here maybe add a major variable maybe
subtract one maybe one of these is
superfluous
so tension
what do we know about tension well a
really really cool insight into tension
and
why it's one of the top contenders for
hypertrophy
causation is that it's been shown that
muscle cells
individual muscle cells uh have forced
transduction detectors
which are called mechanoreceptors uh in
various parts of that cell a lot of them
are located seemingly in the membrane
uh at the sort of outside edges of the
cell and they literally just detect
muscle force
or they detect force transduced along
the membrane so if you pull on a cell
the cell contracts somehow and generates
force along the membrane
then or along var it's various parts
then uh that force is detected okay so
force is occurring and a muscle growth
is signaled
okay sweet so really
tough to rule out tension as a candidate
when there's really literally a um
a mechanistic thing that occurs the
body's actually detecting tension and
we're almost certainly feeling
hypertrophy with it
now how does this all work well uh
a lot of these mechanoreceptors are
sensitive mostly to the cell that
they're on
so the muscle cell if it contracts the
mechanoreceptors
sort of light up and signal other parts
of the cell to start
the growth process potentially
right but uh some of them are probably
sensitive to whole muscle forces as well
so if the whole muscle contracts but
parts of it are not contracted those
parts that aren't contracted because
tension is that develop through the
whole muscle
they'll get sort of some residual
tension detection and they'll still turn
on to some extent
right
[Music]
first thing is a lot of muscle cells
probably almost all of them
don't run the entire whole length of the
muscle right
they connect at some point in the muscle
and connected another point in the
muscle and there's a whole bunch of
muscle outside either way
both uh you know side to side and front
to back
so when you pull on their distal ends
when a muscle contraction occurs and
there's pulling on
every structure in the cell then some of
that pulling might actually
uh generate growth trigger and tension
as if the cell itself was contracting
right especially a stretch has been
shown to be hypertrophic
uh tension developed under stress uh or
under stretch
and if those muscle cells are being
stretched a lot that is actually tension
that is probably detected by the
mechanoreceptors and
you know the cell doesn't have to be on
for that sort of thing to happen so
there is some of that
um and connections between cells are
sometimes um
pretty uh how do i say this best
a lot of times the connection between
cells is pretty pretty
tight so or rather shear resistant so
when one cell is pulled another cell a
lot of times just
for the most part goes with it right so
when a lot of cells around a cell are
contracting
even if that cell's not contracting a
lot of times the motion and the tension
through it is mimicking almost exactly
like it would be contracting anyway
okay that being said this not a perfect
system where a bunch of cells can just
pull another one along
a lot of contraction is cell specific
and this has been shown in a number of
studies
um and most adjacent cell contraction if
cells are contracting next to a muscle
cell
probably doesn't lead to much tension uh
generated or as much as you'd want
in a non-contracting neighbor cell so to
all that complexity is
to put the following that yes you can
get some
growth just by contracting other cells
around a cell
so that the cell itself isn't
necessarily have to be growing
but a lot of growth probably most muscle
growth is caused by the cell itself
contracting
not just adjacent contractions around
right
another interesting uh take is this has
been shown
at least a couple times concentric
muscle contraction
uh triggers muscle growth uh of a
certain kind or a certain
manner eccentric contraction triggers
another kind of growth
and isometric contraction triggers
another kind of growth or rather i say
triggers different growth pathways right
so
there might be something uh to this and
we'll say this formally in just a bit
that uh training with eccentric loading
uh concentric loading and some isometric
uh inclusion might be the best way to
get all the growth that you possibly can
and training just one or just two of
them might not be enough now
here's a really really really
interesting point
passive tension grows much less muscle
than active tension
so if you take a muscle cell and you
pull it apart
it's got a bunch of essentially
stretchy elements to it elastic elements
that
generate a ton of tension right back
right so if it's like a rubber band you
pull on a rubber band and it's a whole
lot of tension occurs
that actually generates some growth
stretch is an independent hypertrophy
mechanism however
it generates way less growth than if you
have that sort of stretch
but you also activate the muscle cell
and it actively tries to contract
against that stretch
so it turns out that force transduction
is probably not everything
but uh some the actual contraction
internally
seems to be something that helps so
uh how does this happen maybe it's not
just the tension itself
but some combination of potential
tension and metabolites
of intracellular contraction and we'll
get to those metabolites in the
metabolites section
but there's a lot of
work done in molecular level to show
that
what probably happens is force is
detected
by the mechanoreceptors and they start
to activate some downstream
growth processes and some of these
growth processes are rather
a molecular chain of events involves
metabolites like phosphatidic acid
calcium for example and phosphatic acid
and calcium
are really essentially just occur in
really high amounts in the cell
pretty much during muscle contraction or
this is sequestered away when muscle
contraction is not occurring
that is when the cell itself is active
when acting in a myosin crossbridge is
in the cell are generating tension
so it might be we're not so sure
that if you just pull on a cell or
really deform it you can generate a lot
of force through the cell
and the mechanoreceptors will detect
that but when they detect it and there's
not a lot of presence of internal
metabolites to signal that the cell
itself is generating that force
there might not be a whole lot of
hypertrophy that's caused but if you
have the internal metabolite generation
there might be a lot of hypertrophy
that's caused in addition to the tension
that's being perceived
so if we take that all together
we have a couple of take homes on
tension
first whole muscle tension is somewhat
anabolic
to all slash most cells which means
that if you do you know a stiff like a
deadlift for sets of eight or something
like that your whole hamstring is
stretching and contracting
there's a chance that some of the cells
or faster motor units or something like
that or
uh muscle cells that are positioned to
mostly the active and leg curling
instead of the hamstring
movement you see in hip hinging there
might be a chance that those cells are
not very active or not active at all but
it turns out that they probably still
grow to some extent
just because the whole muscle is
generating a crapload of force through
so there's something to be said for that
so at the very least we don't have to
super overthink training
to get really good results but maybe we
do to have to get our best results
the second point is that per fiber and
thus per motor unit because all
motor units activate all fibers in them
equally
per fiber tension is likely much more
anabolic
than passive tension derived through
stretch or through other cells
contracting around the muscle cell and
pulling it along for the ride
so when you want maximum muscle growth
you'd probably want to at some point
involve the activation
and internal tension generation which is
mostly the same thing
all of the cells that you're targeting
because you want all muscle cells to
grow
right now tension
via stretch is mildly anabolic if you
just stretch a muscle it grows
but tension via internal contraction is
a very anabolic
so muscle cells grow a lot when they
themselves contract and generate forces
within them
rather than the forces coming from
stretching or deformation from the
outside
probably the best kind of hypertrophy is
when both are occurring
which is why tension under stretch both
at the same time is super super
hypertrophic and is actually uniquely
hypertrophic
right so if we take all of this together
we have kind of a recommendation for how
to train to maximize tension
we want to generate lots of active
tension which is to say we don't just
want to do stretches we want to do
actual contraction
we want to generate it concentrically
isometrically
and eccentrically at various points in
our training we'll talk about later how
to get that that's a pretty
straightforward
we want to induce uh introduce stretch
under the tension so you don't just want
to do like just isometric contractions
or biceps like this
you probably want to generate a lot of
tension at a lengthened
uh position of all the muscles at some
point in training
and you probably want to activate as
high of a percentage
of muscle cells to actually themselves
contract as possible
for max growth stimulus because as we
saw earlier a lot of the cells around
can be contracting
and it turns out that muscle cells
themselves that aren't activated
uh might you know receive some
hypertrophic stimulus but maybe not
nearly as much as we would want
for best results all right that's
tension
certainly candidate number one for
hypertrophy probably causes most of the
hypertrophy
now metabolites okay we have
uh from the last section on tension we
have this quote so perhaps it's not just
down to tension itself
but some combination of tension and
metabolites of intracellular
contraction which is like actin and
myosin-based contraction
so what we're saying is this tension
might actually cause most of its muscle
growth
not through the fact that the tension is
being detected
because if that was the case a stretch
would cause a lot of hypertrophy
it doesn't it just causes a little bit
what might actually happen is that
when we generate tension internally
part of that process a side effect of it
or the process that causes it
is the generation of a high degree of
internal metabolites for example
phosphatic acid has a lot of evidence as
a literal
cause of muscle growth and it's a huge
part generated
in the internal tension producing
process in a muscle cell
right so is it the tension that's
causing the growth
or is it the phosphatic acid that's a
huge part of that process to generate
tension
what about calcium calcium is a huge
candidate because calcium
has to essentially flood out out of the
sarcoplasmic reticulum
into the muscle cell itself to get
active mouse and to talk to each other
and calcium it seems like a real high
candidate for
if you have a big calcium flood you're
almost certainly generating highest
tensions and
calcium flooding is super related to
how close to failure a muscle cell gets
and how high of tension it generates
both are are super indicative of how
much calcium super correlated how much
calcium
appears inside the cell so it might be
that hypertrophy occurs in part as
phosphatic acid detection
and in part as calcium detection right
and again how do we say
it's not just the tension itself it
could be the tension itself but when you
stretch a muscle cell and actually
generate a crapload of tension through
it
um if it's not activated it doesn't grow
a ton of muscle not nearly as much as we
would expect something's missing
internal metabolites may be that very
thing notice we said internal
metabolites
one of which might be lactic acid or
some evidence there
and almost certainly other metabolites
uh various ions are
probably involved in that process right
so when these metabolites are generated
inside the muscle cell
itself when it's contracting it's making
them
they almost certainly play a big role in
growth stimulus right
and this is of course to repeat myself
fifth time uh this is evidenced by less
growth by a passive tension than active
tension okay active tension
causes much more growth and passive
tension it could be that there is a way
that
active tension actually pulls on certain
structures that really causes the growth
but another very high likelihood is that
the pull from passive and active tension
is really kind of similar as far as the
cell is concerned
but passive tension doesn't generate any
internal metabolites and those may be
the ones that cause the most growth
right however
the big question here when people say
metabolites they say like the burn
metabolites writ large not just internal
to the cell
hilariously enough metabolites internal
to the cell
cannot be detected by your nerves no
susceptibly right there's no pain to
detect because the nerves are external
to the muscle
so if you only generate a high degree of
calcium inside the muscle which is
probably something that happens with
like sets of five or something like that
which cause a lot of growth by the way
almost none of that calcium leaks out
uh or none of that um you know for
example lactic acid leaks out
because it just stays internal to cell
it causes a crap load of hypertrophy
they're very likely
but doesn't leak out and cause the
nerves any pain so sets of five probably
don't give you a burn
so when we say metabolites we're
actually talking about something else so
here are the big questions
can metabolites first of all leave the
cell in which they were generated
the answer is definitely yes but we're
not sure how big of concentrations they
leave the cell and go to other cells
versus how much concentration is
required to grow muscle in the cell
itself because it could be like
maybe 100 units of lactic acid inside
the cell itself for 100 units of calcium
and then if if the adjacent cell is not
contracting
right uh and those leak in how much of
them really leak in realistically before
you hit failure and stop and have to
wash out the metabolites
well if it's like five or ten units of
both of them maybe the requirement for
hypertrophy for trained athletes is like
at least 30 units of
lactic acid and calcium well then like
eg metabolites just are real
specific at that point there's just not
enough of them leaking across cell lines
and then you have to actually activate
every single cell that you want to grow
which is very very possible right
so question one do they leave the cell
in which they were generated or
in question two is do they enter
adjacent non-contracting cells
which is also probably very true right
and then number three is in amounts high
enough to cause growth in those cells
at least one study in lactic acid uh
says
yes but one study gee that's really not
that great
and um you know lactic acid can leave
does calcium leave to a large extent
probably not a ton does phosphatidic
acid i'm not sure
so we're left with this idea that
metabolites are probably
very important because remember
metabolites are really just
molecular products generated by muscle
contraction in some way shape or form
almost certainly you know even even you
could say
tension if the molecules that detect
tension
generate other molecules that then
message to the cell nucleus to grow
muscle those are technically metabolites
so almost some point just by definitions
metabolites cause probably 100 of
hypertrophy
but the real question is metabolites
generated in one cell do they leave and
cause other cells next to them that
maybe aren't contracting
do they cause uh growth and how do we
know which ones leave well they're the
ones that hurt our nerves so when you're
doing like a set of four or something
like that
are you generating metabolites inside
the cells that are actually contracting
of course
but are you getting metabolized to leak
to other cells probably not because your
nerves would detect them that would
be registered as pain when you instead
of 25
close to failure there's lots of
metabolite leakage that occurs to
a whole bunch of cells probably gets
into other muscle cells
the question is is it high enough
concentrations to cause any muscle
growth and we're not so sure about that
the lactic acid studies say yes
but we need much more data to say how
much it is or
to what extent that actually happens
right
so last slide here are metabolites do
metabolites cause growth inside the cell
which they are made almost certainly and
perhaps most of it
at some level metabolites probably cause
all growth because there's one molecule
that even the tension receptors uh
signal up regulation is technically a
metabolite
right uh do metabolites cause growth
inside cells adjacent to where they are
made
maybe but probably not a ton of it right
uh and and that's basically you know
you can get fiber specific hypertrophy
if you
uh stop real short of failure all the
time your faster twitch motor units
probably won't grow a lot
and you can actually get some pretty
decent lactate accumulation and
metabolite accumulation but
it prob probably only so much of it
crosses cell boundaries
and you probably need a whole lot of it
to trigger a lot of hypertrophy right
the amount of lactic acid that occurs in
the cell in which it's being produced
versus in the adjacent cell i mean if
half of it crosses then you just have
half right and that might not even be
enough to trigger any growth and maybe
just in beginners or something like that
to make this a little bit more complex
we can say okay
what if metabolite growth really did
affect adjacent cells
how would that work well you start doing
a set
and your slow twitch fibers are the ones
that turn on first let's say it's a set
of 20.
your slower switch fibers turn on first
your fasteners fibers are not active
very much
to some small extent and the thing about
slower twitch fibers is that they just
don't leak a lot of metabolites they're
really good at processing them
and sequestering them and buffering them
and reusing them like lactic acid they
just reuse internally
uh it just goes right into glycolysis or
sorry goes right into oxidative
phosphorylation
so we could say okay we're going to use
the slow-choice fibers to make a bunch
of metabolites
those metabolites are going to cross
over and activate or sorry and cause
growth in the faster twitch fibers so we
never really need to go super close to
failure or go heavy because we can just
get that translocation of metabolites
well
problem is the slower fibers don't leak
a lot of metabolites
so there goes that right so until you
start activating faster twitch fibers
the metabolite leakage is not a really
big deal and
the good news is that the late
activating or later activating faster
twitch fibers
they do leak a ton of metabolites very
likely but at that point
they're already contracting so what is
it that we're trying to contract further
or what is it that we're trying to grow
muscle with further for example let's
say we have the three biggest fibers
in our biceps or something like that and
the least big of the fibers starts to
really leak some lactic acid
and it leaks into the other fibers and
start to cause them to grow well in
about a rep or two
they're gonna start to turn on anyway so
this idea that okay we can
really just use some of our muscle
fibers to grow the others even though
they don't
contract by the time the muscle fibers
that produce the most lactic acid the
faster twitch ones
are actually active and producing a ton
of metabolites
then all of the other muscle fibers that
we're trying to uh sort of activate
without them having to contract they
started contracting anyway are gonna be
very shortly so there's kind of nothing
extra to grow at that point
the one trick here is that vascular
occlusion
right uh that kind of training occlusion
training katsu training
might alter this a bit because it might
start to sum metabolites
really quickly and allow the metabolites
to sum up way before the faster twitch
motor units are really starting to turn
on which might grow a bunch of muscle
uh that isn't yet uh super active uh
in its tension-generating abilities so
we may get more of that growth spread
from one cell to the others via this
technique
uh but that's a really really big maybe
because fatigue also hits way faster in
those sets
so you would think okay the metabolites
are really flooding we're gonna get tons
of growth now and then you reach failure
right so it might not be the case uh but
in any way uh certainly something
to be interested in and look further
all right last growth mechanism is
cell swelling really good thing about
cell swelling is it gets a short shift a
lot
uh in a lot of writing on hypertrophy
but it's one of the ones that has some
really good studies behind the direct
mechanistic
demonstrations that it causes
hypertrophy okay so cell swelling almost
certainly just
literally causes muscle growth right to
the point where they can inject stuff
into a cell to make it blow up a bit and
it actually hypertrophy mechanism start
going
there are some doubts however is this
the myofibrillar hypertrophy the actual
construction of actin myosin
uh that we are looking for or is the
construction
of essentially titan nebula and a bunch
of other framework proteins
that make the cell bigger but not any
more strong and
not in any way that lasts very long as
soon as you stop getting repeated cell
swelling the cell just shrinks back to
its normal size because it doesn't need
to be that big anymore uh
maybe maybe we're not so sure which is
why south swelling doesn't get a huge
high ranking for us
as a growth mediator because it might
not explain a whole lot of the variance
another problem with cell swelling is
that that's of five
sets of six sets of seven sets of eight
they are reliably growing muscle
as good as well as any other set but
they cause almost no south swallowing
whatsoever
or very little of it so maybe
self-swelling is not not this huge deal
right and that gets to the point of how
potent of a mechanism is it
um probably not very potent but it
probably contributes to some extent
right so we can tentatively suggest that
the pump
probably causes some degree of growth
we're going to talk about later why the
pump might cause some
uh growth outside of its relationship to
cell swelling
that precisely the kind of metabolite
accumulation and
super high tensions and all the fibers
uh that cause cell swelling or
sorry that uh cause growth in their own
regard might also cause the pump as a
secondary feature so the pump might
actually be a real good detector for
hypertrophy
in many cases even though the pump
itself might only be responsible for a
small fraction of the growth
all right hugely important when you take
all this together what does it imply for
the training process
okay so first
implication is muscle cells really only
develop a high concentration
of internal metabolites the ones that
cause probably most muscle growth
when contracting at high percentages of
maximum ability
right so if you get a muscle fiber to
contract at 25 percent of its maximum
voluntary contraction ability you
produce some all these metabolites and
they usually just get
basically recycled as quickly as they're
produced you can sustain a contraction
like that for a long time
and cause almost no muscle growth
whatsoever this is evidenced by the fact
that marathon runners
um they contract a bunch of their lower
body musculature and
almost never maximal and they you know
are doing this for hours on end and
they're not hypertrophy to any extent
possibly even atrophy to some extent and
this is not all nutritional and so on
and so forth
and there's definitely a force mediated
or
accumulation of metabolites immediate
effect there so
uh because maximum contraction uh or
threshold contraction is a good idea for
every single cell
then approaching failure is probably a
good idea on the per
fiber level right so if you're going to
grow a muscle fiber
it had better be working real hard
working so hard
that it generates a lot of internal
tension for some time
and that it also generates a lot of
internal metabolites
very very high concentrations which are
probably what signal the cell to
hypertrophy
right point number two
tension in the highest threshold motor
units
is only maximized when they themselves
contract yes there are some
uh ways to get tension going with just
peripheral activation
but nothing beats the contraction of the
motor unit itself
right and not only does the tension have
to be applied because we can do that
with stretching to
some hypertrophic uh benefit but not
much there has to be probably a lot of
internal metabolite generation during
that can only be caused by that muscle
contraction
right and that probably has to occur
with a contraction for a length of time
so for example
tension is an interesting uh candidate
for hypertrophy but you you might get
this idea that okay
so we take uh let's say a barbell
that's loaded with 85 percent of runner
max and we do a single rep with it
okay um we put it down that single rep
generated as with as fast as movement as
possible uh almost certainly activates
uh the vast majority of your muscle
fibers and
uh probably at the highest forces that
they're capable of
exerting right and we can even say okay
if i could you know 85 is not good
enough 92
i mean it's been shown a bunch that
anything from 90 to 100 is roughly
equivalent in how much per
per fiber force is being generated a lot
of it whether or not you make the lift
comes down to technique in which way
you're pointed
so and the result in velocity too uh the
force velocity relationship
is very valuable but within very close
velocities the forces are sometimes
roughly equivalent
so what ends up happening is you do a
rep like that
of ninety percent then you stop you rest
for a while
when you do another rep at ninety
percent you stop you rest for a while
people train like this
power lifters train like this and it's
not very causative of hypertrophy it
certainly causes some
but not nearly as much as you would
expect i mean a power lifter can do you
know
a whole bunch of what are called you
know effective wraps maximally effective
reps at this point
and not get a lot of hypertrophy or sets
of two is not a way to grow a lot of
muscle
even though every single one of those
two reps is as hypertrophic as it gets
because it produces the maximum amount
of tension you would think
right however what is missing from that
is that
those muscle fibers that are the highest
threshold
they're not actually all muscle fibers
in a set of two or set of one wrap
they don't produce tension for long
enough at high enough levels
to you know the levels are as high as
they get the the length is the problem
they don't produce tension for long
enough
to really start to summate internally to
themselves not leak out
a whole lot of metabolites that probably
cause muscle growth
like you get an increase in calcium
concentration in a cell
when it does a set of one right but then
it goes back down and you rest for a
long time and instead of one and it goes
back down
so you might get some hypertrophy there
but if you get a cell
close to failure it generates a ton of
calcium or ton of phosphatic acid boom
and then for several seconds you keep
contracting and the levels are super
high super high super high and they
reach failure and they fall off
right that might be like five or six
times as much exposure to those
metabolites internally to the cell
than just singles or doubles would so
this is why i think
maybe the sets of five and above tend to
cause
more hypertrophy than sets of five and
below is because of that
exposure right but let's be clear most
of that exposure is internal to the cell
so you can't just generate a lot of meta
generate a lot of metabolites
in the muscle as a whole and expect all
those metabolites to leak in
and really really activate a bunch of
growth probably happens to some extent
but
a small one so what uh point number two
is we want tension to be very high in
every motor unit that we're trying to
train
and we want it to be high for quite some
time which means
probably at least five repetitions worth
of uh
time under tension so to speak okay so
we've got that
um point number three most fibers
contract with either heavy loading or
near failure conditions which is by the
way to say the same thing
okay faster motor units don't contract
unless they're required
to generate the force necessary to keep
the movement going if the weight is
really heavy
they're required to generate enough
force to keep the movement going
or if everything else is tired and
you're in really high reps
as you reach failure in order to keep
doing reps you have to activate those
larger
faster twitch muscle fibers which grow
most of your muscle anyway
uh to go to keep doing more reps so
point number three is basically saying
not only does the individual muscle
fiber need to be challenged for a long
time
the whole muscle as a whole probably
needs to either be trained heavy
or go close to failure this is a super
super interesting
implication of training that has really
really far-reaching effects and we know
already from experimental direct
evidence so
we have a feeling about it but it
matches the physiology
seemingly so well that it's a very very
powerful realization
in other words if someone says hey we're
going to train to get jacked
there's the next question you have to
ask if it's proper training is is it
going to hurt a lot because there's lots
of metabolites am i going to be grinding
a ton of
close to failure sets or is the weight
going to be crushing me if it's none of
those three things
or even those two things of going close
to failure or training really heavy
uh you're probably not in for a lot of
muscle growth which is another way of
saying training to be hard
right can you imagine a way of
hypertrophy training that was neither
heavy nor got you close to failure
that would be awesome i would train like
that immediately but unfortunately
it's probably not likely because of the
very fact that muscles only really grow
when you really really challenge them
when they're generating lots of tension
internally when the metabolites
internally are really really high in
order to do that you got to push muscles
uh either really really heavy uh or
closer to failure which is actually the
same
identical thing because if you're
lifting your 5rm and you lift it four
times
that's a one rep shy failure same idea
right
now this is an interesting idea it may
or may not be true
it's worth considering slower twitch
fibers or intermediate twitch fibers
might need longer times to contract and
sum up enough tension and internal
metabolites
uh to signal uh the most growth because
remember those fibers churn through
metabolites really really well they're
really high endurance
so to really sum up very high metabolite
levels inside them they might actually
need to contract for longer than the
faster twitch
uh fibers themselves so uh
higher rep sets may at times be
necessary for full development
like if you just do your fastest
possible or sorry if you just do
the low rep sets that's a 5 to 10 you
may be missing out
on intermediate fiber growth which has
been shown to cause some good degree of
muscle growth right
now we have an understanding
from direct experiments that heavy
training
and uh lighter training are roughly
equivalent to hypertrophy because
how if lighter training activates the
faster switch motor units and the slower
ones for growth
and and the heavier training only
activates really and only grows
uh sorry it activates all of them but it
really only allows internal metabolite
summation
to occur with these faster uh units and
maybe leaves the slower ones behind well
here's the deal
by the time and this is point number
five by the time that you get towards
the last reps
in a very high rep set you have two
problems
one you have nervous system fatigue so
when it comes time
to do of 25 reps that to failure
when it comes time to do reps 21 22 23
24 and 25
you are so tired mentally
neurologically from doing the first 20
reps
that you might not get full activation
of your nervous system
over those high threshold motor units
that you're now trying to activate when
you're really tired so you might miss
out on a good deal
of faster muscle switch activation which
if you're just doing a set of five
it would be from the first rep you're
activating maximum all the
faster efficient motor units second rep
all of them third rep fourth
fifth rep all of them right yeah the
slower twitch guys don't get as much
uh love and don't get as much stimulus
but the faster which ones grow so much
more anyway
in super high rep training might be the
opposite that that's occurring
right and in addition to that even if
the nervous system is like you stopped
apart you're like super psyched and
it just so happens your nervous system
doesn't get tired you can actually get
local
limitations of contraction by a
excitation contraction uncoupling
which means for example if you have a
ton of metabolites in the neuromuscular
junction so we have the nerve
we have the muscle itself and we have uh
sort of a
little junction between the two and
that's where neurotransmitters leave the
nerve and tell the muscle to contract
right if you have a ton of metabolites
in this space which definitely happens
with super high rep sets
you might actually have a problem not
just the space but around the nerve
in the nerve in the periphery of the
muscle what ends up happening is
you have a problem with excitation
contraction coupling which is to say
that the nerve could be saying fire fire
fire but it has trouble
releasing metabolites or sorry trouble
releasing neurotransmitters there may be
trouble accepting neurotransmitters the
meat trouble
at any part of uh the distal part of the
nerve
and the proximal part of the muscle
itself there may be part
uh problems in various mechanisms by
which excitation of the nerve
transduces and actually causes muscle
contraction you can actually feel this
effect sort of
when you're really close to failure on a
set of biceps for example in a mega drop
set
right so in a mega drop set you know you
do like uh set to five to failure then a
set of five to failure and like less
weight less weight five to failure
after a while you get this idea that
you're pulling as hard as you can
you might even be like you're metal in
your headphones you're good to go
nervous system you're just trying as
hard as possible you don't feel
neurologically fatigued which is pretty
easy to feel it's when you're
like oh get me out of here i just want
to try anymore you're trying as hard as
you can
but there seems to be this inability to
actually get your muscle to contract
it's almost like a loss of mind muscle
connection to where like i'm trying i
just don't feel like anything's
happening
that's a real thing right and the
feelings might be illusory it might be
all in mental
but this does happen when metabolites
are super high
so we got to be careful about assuming
that sets of 25 and 30 are the best
possible way to grow muscle
because by the time you get to number 20
you might be neurologically super
fatigued and you might have
trouble activating those fasteners motor
units as much as they could possibly be
activated
now of course they're probably active to
some extent the entire time
but they're probably not maximally
activated until the very end and that's
where most growth occurs
so what we end up happening is sets of
five
very heavy you get a ton of faster
switch activation
because it's all fresh and new and
really good uh which is good it gives
you maybe ninety percent of your
potential growth
and then for sets of you know 20 to 30
you might get a bunch of it all the slow
twitch activation you need or
hypertrophy stimulus all the
intermediate twitch
most of the faster twitch but not all of
it because of these problems of the
neural fatigue
and with excitation contraction coupling
and then you might get only up to 90 of
maximum hypertrophy
so what's the answer to that well maybe
you do
some of both maybe sets of 10 to 20
are on average maybe they get you 95
percent of hypertrophy because they
combine both
in some extent or maybe they they net 90
as well because there's some fatigue in
them
but there's also a lot of you know less
fatigue than there would be in the 25.
there's some good slower twitch
intermediate fiber uh summation
of metabolites and activation but maybe
not as much as in the 20-25
so it might be that sets of five to 10
sets of 10 to 20 cents of 20-30 each
activate only about 90
of potential hypertrophy so how can you
do your best
there's at least a couple of studies
that show that combining repetition
ranges
probably works to maximize results but
they said to be very very precise
studies
when you you have 90 percent as much
hypertrophy between two rep ranges it's
almost undetectable unless you have like
100 subjects or something like that
but theoretically it makes some sense it
might be worth considering doing that
right uh
so point number six just reflects what
we just said near failure training with
heavy loads probably grows the higher
threshold motor units the best
near failure training at lighter loads
always causes pumps and lots of
metabolite leakage which addresses those
growth pathways so it probably has its
own place in training
so we can take all of these likelihoods
together and go
into programming recommendations so all
this together
we're going to weave it back into
programming recommendations
first thing we're going to see is we
already knew a lot of the stuff but some
of the stuff
we know better and we know more
certainly because we understand the
physiology
point number one in programming
recommendations any less
than five reps in reserve of training is
probably a poor use of training time
uh as near failure training is just more
hypertrophic for all of the reasons we
talked about right it activates the most
uh fast twitch motor units it allows the
internal metabolites to sum up to really
really high levels which probably causes
a lot of hypertrophy
number two already mentioned this there
may be unique benefits
to training in the low repetition ranges
in the higher rep ranges and the
moderate
rep range may offer the best trade-offs
or just be roughly average of the two
probably your best bet is to some extent
use all three
ranges by a very small margin which is
to say
you know any range alone can cause near
optimal gains right it's probably like
if you just train with sets of five to
ten you get ninety percent of the growth
you are supposed to get
if you just do sets of ten to twenty you
get ninety percent of the growth you
ever get
if you just train sets of twenty to
thirty you get 90 of the growth you want
to get and so on and so forth
right an interesting concern there
however
is the following faster twitch motor
units
probably don't require as much physical
work right as many uh reps
uh with maximum tension so on and so
forth as many sets
uh as do the faster twitch uh or sorry
as do the slower twitch muscles
slow stretch muscles might also recover
faster so
when you're designing a training program
over the course of the week
it's probably unlikely that 75
of it will be in the 5 to 10 rep range
and only 25 percent
in the lighter rep ranges it probably is
skewed the other way
where maybe only twenty five percent of
your training needs to be in the five to
ten rep range and it's a little bit
injurious a little risky
but it checks the box for those faster
twitch motor units and then maybe a full
seventy five percent of your training
can be between the
ten and thirty rep range that way you
get all the benefits of that range
and it's safer on average to do and you
can recover from it relatively faster
especially from a neurological
perspective
point number three on the metabolite
front if your training is not causing
any notable burn it might not be optimal
because metabolites probably cause some
degree of hypertrophy
and if your training is causing amazing
pumps it's
very likely to be anabolic both directly
via swell
cell swelling and indirectly because
you're probably training really close to
failure
which is good for hypertrophy and
generating a lot of metabolites which is
really good
which also causes lots of pumps and
producing lots of forces actually
causes the muscle to contract and
essentially act
as its own sort of vasoconstrictor and
when you release
you get reactive hyperemia which causes
a pump so basically
if you're not getting pumps it should be
in the five to ten rep range
at most probably in the five to seven
rep range anything above eight reps if
your training is not causing reliable
pumps you might not be training hard
enough close to failure enough
might not be eating enough carbohydrates
so on and so forth so pumps
probably indicative of really good
things coming your way
lastly point number five because
concentric isometric
and eccentric hypertrophy seem to
trigger potentially different
uh pathways for muscle growth you
probably want to do
lots of all of these which means what
well
you mean you want to do a concentric on
almost every rep you're going to have to
you want to control the centric on every
rep i don't mean super super slow just
make sure you're still active on the on
the eccentric and
some pauses at the bottom of a movement
or at the top of a movement doesn't have
to be in all movements
are probably really good pause and
squeeze at the same time is really good
interestingly enough bodybuilders for a
long time but able to do a lot of stupid
shit that doesn't work just out of
tradition
but some of the stuff they do a lot of
it is really really effective
a lot of bodybuilders swear by peak
contractions and top holes and stuff
like that and then there might be
something to
that because of the isometric
contraction benefits
all right so summary implications of
this whole thing
the direct causes of muscle growth via
training are probably very complex
and they are also still a little bit
mysterious so we don't know everything
here this is a very speculative talk
please remember that um but we know that
training is probably
uh tension metabolite and cell swelling
mediated at some level
i'm not sure what percent of what
accounts for it especially
the complexity that the way your body
might detect tension
might in large part be by the act of
tension generation and thus the
metabolite generation internal to the
cell
right but there has been a i don't know
about debate
there's been some conversation about
which one of these is really the one
that causes
muscle growth from a training
perspective
i think this debate is potentially
fruitful
but not necessarily a good idea why
because there is no reason to think
that there is only one training mediated
cause of muscle growth
there is not one mediated cause of
muscle growth for other factors for
example let me ask you a question
what grows muscle is it insulin is it
testosterone
is it leucine actually all three of
those grow muscle
it's been demonstrated a whole bunch
they cause mtor activity
it leads to muscle growth so can someone
say well you know it's really not
testosterone it's leucine or no it's
really just leucine it's not
testosterone that's the ridiculous
debate it's all three of those things
right so what do you do to grow the most
training you
eat an adequate amount of carbohydrates
so you're not very low on insulin
you uh you know make sure that your
hormones are in balance you don't
overreach or undersleep so your
testosterone is super low
and you eat plenty of protein to get a
good leucine spike with every single
meal
and grow muscle just like that you have
to check three boxes and a whole lot
more actually
uh in order to grow muscle from a sort
of like nutraceutical perspective
so what about from a training
perspective why is it the there is no
debate about which one of the insulin
testosterone or leucine grows
muscle they all contribute to muscle
growth in their own ways and of course a
bunch of other things like myostatin for
example
why is it that we're looking for just
one causative variable of hypertrophy
from a training perspective
either tension or metabolites or
self-swelling maybe it's all three maybe
there's even more than we don't know
about right
until we know more right your best
growth chances is to train close to
failure for reps and reserve and lower
and train everywhere in the ranges
between five reps per set 30 reps per
set
and if you're avoiding the burn if
you're avoiding the pump
if you're avoiding deep stretches and
peak contractions you're probably doing
yourself for this service so really good
training sets of 5 to 30
with lots of burn lots of pump lots of
deep stretches under tension
peak contractions and that's about it
that was a doozy folks see you next time
for
number six which just happens
to be on damage
and growth
you
