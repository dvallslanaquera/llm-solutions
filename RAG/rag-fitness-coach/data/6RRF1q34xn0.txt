cheese would be so good
cheese is good anytime i have a
conversation with someone i'm like i'm
not into cheese i'm like we're not into
being friends
you like fucking
cheese that's good
fermented cheese oh it's boring say
cheese on pizza man what
oh jared if you had a cheeseless pizza i
would literally slate yourself i know
what's that called like that's a philly
thing yeah hot tomato pie yeah that's
how it feels
like for sure yeah yeah yeah why first
time i had it was like billy it was like
famous
is it better than cheese fuck nonsense
no no no i can't believe it can be good
but if someone offered it to me i would
consider that personal insult you want a
slice of pizza it's like dipping fucking
bread and marinara sauce it's like a
deep fish you've never had a fucking
pizza but it's like sausages
[Music]
folks we got the most important muscle
in the human body
calves up first
and then after calves we're gonna do
some rose i'm gonna get nice and naked
for you guys yeah yeah you like that
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the crowd loves
it
yay and then we're gonna do some lap
prayers cable lap prayers and then we
are going to finish off the back really
fucking burn it out
with a mag grip
rip-off
i don't know that this is a formal
company uh pulled out so bath time
we're back back from the future
to the future but for the record i hated
all the fucking stupid movies like
what's his name will bitch ass
motherfucker
don't watch back to the future and if
you do hate it
let's get into caps
it's fine
it's gonna be fine
you're not gonna fall asleep
calf training is fucking bomb
more time
[Music]
i'm sorry that's all you're getting of
this exciting
dynamic exercise
mr spielberg
[Music]
rose to start back training the other
day of the week we do bent rows in the
smith machine it's the spinal director's
tongue especially the lower ones
and of course the rest of the back these
ones
are chest supported really in my case
tummy supported because i like to
protract and then retract
you guys will see in the video which
muscles that works there's tons of other
muscles in your back it's not just your
lats
if you're rolling to optimize lat
engagement there is a chance you're
doing a good thing there's also a chance
you're making a fundamental mega fucking
mistake
it's like trying to bench press in such
a way that hits your triceps the most
there are lots of better exercises for
the triceps than the bench there are
lots of better exercises for the lats
every pull over and every pull down and
pull-up version it's 50 times better for
less than any fucking row so here we're
using it for the rest of the back spinal
erectors the rhomboids terra's major etc
mid-traps upper traps even it's a
fucking thing so
we're gonna do
probably four or five sets
anywhere from
10 to 20 reps p contraction at the top
on the prime row prime row is probably
one of the best row machines ever made
because it has a variable cam resistance
and you can make it biomechanically
optimal
by making a ton of force requisite at
the bottom of the stretch which
scientifically shown to grow more muscle
and stretch under tension and then
really get an awesome peak contraction
with a lighter load when you're
mechanically not as strong at the top
let's get it done
oh
fuck
[Music]
hey folks
mike here
i guess dr mike that's my internet name
charlie's here jared's here team full
rob in the house
we are here to talk about
questions of how hard to push during
prep do you have a temptation to push
really hard in the gym
are you ever lazy in the gym during prep
some people have trouble getting really
like amp during prep guys walk me
through
your psychology as to how you think
about
deciding
maybe i should train harder maybe i
should back off
maybe i should eat more food i'm
starving myself and you know i'm saying
harry potter is not a bodybuilding
champion i'm not trying to weigh 100
pounds
so how do we navigate that
psychologically charlie why don't you
start us off well well my answer is
really easy uh luckily from the data we
got from my first prep
and having just you guys embroidery on
my side
pretty much building my health prep for
me
i don't have to worry about anything
sure but you do anyway don't
you have doubts you think maybe we're
not pushing hard enough maybe we're
pushing too hard
not the too hard portion i think maybe
not hard enough maybe it's always maybe
not hard enough because last prep in
training especially i wanted to push
balls to wall all the time because i
thought i had to and how'd that work
miserably terribly i just like
just
immense amounts of fatigue how did that
express itself sleep just went to shit
joint stuff uh joint stuff a little bit
uh
i was tired all the time
like
man it was like existing was hard
yeah yeah it was really tough because
you were going way too close to failure
in the gym chasing mega pr's it was
going for these crazy
pr's which because the special
supplements you have
in most situations i would never go for
i'd never go for like a
plate pr like a 90 pound pr and a hex
squat but you did i did and it was easy
yeah but on hindsight i should have
never done that it just took an easy
10-pound increase
and you know matched or increased rest
by maybe a rep or two if you're getting
stronger for rex during prep you are
already winning there's you're not
building a ton of muscle during prep
anyway
and
the fatigue is something that will catch
up to you
oh
[Music]
yes
[Music]
rows are done
now we move on to the flat stuff
so lap prayers quick super handy
technique guide you put your hands
wherever is comfortable for your
shoulders if you put them too close you
might get shoulder pain you put them too
wide you might get shoulder pain and
your pecs get involved a lot you don't
feel your last a ton so ideally as far
forward and close together as possible
but that allows your shoulders to be
good i usually either grab right at the
bend of this bar or right here and the
particular execution isn't super super
nuanced you can do it in a bunch of
different ways but a couple of things
have to happen specifically you have to
have force generated at the stretch
if you're stopping your laptop if you're
going to here and you're stopping like
here like a lot of people do remember
tension under stretch is a huge stimulus
hypertrophy and most light exercises
simply do not allow your lats to stretch
even in pull downs and pull ups the max
stretch isn't really super possible
because your arms are locked in place
here and this and this is where they
stretch and they can't hit those
positions with lat prayers we can hit
the position because we come all the way
down and then on the way back up we push
our chest down
lifting our lats and stretching big
and then coming all the way down to
touch we mostly touch here for the fact
that it's easy for tracking you know
what's a wrap you know it's failure and
then control that eccentric big time
big stretch open up everything chest
stays down shoulders open and then back
down we're going to be doing three sets
two of them heavier sets of 10 or so
the last one more like 15 a little
downside let's get started
[Music]
so
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
jared you get into your own head don't
you
yeah sometimes
again like i coach myself
a lot and then
oftentimes i'll be calling mike or
somebody for advice um if i do get in my
head which is nice because it's like we
kind of help each other he does that to
me too he'll call me and be like what do
you think about this i'll call him like
hey
i'm doing this what do you think about
me doing this instead it was kind of a
logical conversation about it so it's
nice to be able to do that and swipe all
ideas off of each other and know that
you're
you're very intelligent friends that
wouldn't give you a bullshit answer and
just be like push the fucking pedal to
the metal bro you know like that kind of
shit
but again it's just like charlie i sell
coach i have a lot of fucking data
so if i'm
over doing the gym volume i know for a
fact um often times when this will be
because you wanted more than
philosophical shit
i know for a fucking fact
that i go into the gym on leg days and
even if i'm just hitting the numbers or
i'm rep matching or i'm increasing by
like a rep or five pounds the mentality
is is completely different than when i
train back it's just completely fucking
different and that's why it's your
nemesis i get back is my absolute news
i'll wake up some days especially like
the really fatiguing days where i'm like
three weeks out and i'm all alone i'm in
vegas mike moves like i wake up i know
it's back day and i'm just like not
fucking motivated at all
and i'd have to rely on the discipline
and i just i'll go into the gym and it
literally takes me 30 minutes of doing
bullshit before i'm even ready to train
oftentimes my effort and my mentality
and approach to it is i know it's fuck
complete dog shit so having a training
partner for me when i'm doing back
especially during prep is fairly
important and when i don't i just know
that i i slack a little bit so it's very
frustrating and very it's fatiguing to
like
wake up and not want to train
yes because that's like my favorite
thing to do and one of my best parts of
my day and to wake up and
feel like i don't want to go to the gym
it's fucking weird like i'm just like
back
[Music]
oh
last back exercise for today we're now
getting into the point where
a whole lot of sets here is going to be
jump volume so we're going to do two
sets each of lat pull downs we're using
the mag grip option here we happen to
use the mag grips i fucking personally
hate them two sets here oh right around
the sort of 20 15 to 20 rep range pull
downs usually best perform higher reps
it allows more time executing tension
more time and retention which the last
thing to prefer most people and if you
want to go heavy that's what pull-ups
are for so for pull-downs we're going to
make sure in most cases we're going to
do the higher end of rep range just 10
to 20 or even 20 to 25 even sometimes
30. let's get it done
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
i started with thinking about pushing
and pulling a lot i'm mostly coach
myself even though charlie broderick and
jared helped me a lot but i have a cool
thing for diet i figured out recently
if i ever think i need a diet harder i
do and my cutoff point is when i have
one night where i'm so hungry i can't
sleep it doesn't matter what else you do
if you don't get decent sleep and you're
prep you're done you lose muscle and
gain fat radically in every situation in
which you don't sleep well i would say
if you're pushing so hard that you have
sleep problems you're pushing too hard
on an objective level if you're pushing
so hard that your fatigue is
skyrocketing like crazy your joints hurt
and everything you're pushing too hard
at the gym and uh
it's uh
you just have to understand that stuff
takes a while
and if you get to a point in your prep
where you're like there's no way i'm
gonna be lean no matter how hard i push
just cancel the show and just
do another show later and as you get
leaner over time even on your math
phases and you've got practice peaking
and getting right to the show you'll
know like charlie has a ton of data we
know all his calories all his macros all
his activity all the supplements we just
repeat the process and tune it a little
and we get the same fucking result and
that's it and after a while it'll be
much easier and i'm getting to that
place myself and jared's been there for
fucking years now so fuck him everything
comes easier to jared jared's a white
trash piece of shit youtube please don't
cancel me
[Music]
okay
kent
i'm good to go
what's the first post
they don't call it front relax homie you
walk out on the stage you hit it
[Music]
pressure forward
[Music]
good
damn mike
try your quads you stupid quarter turn
[Music]
charlie
charlie front foot facing the curtain
front foot facing the curtain just a tad
angle it there it is yes
you too mike
there you go good
more hamstring that way
good stuff guys
quarter turn
same thing with the
feet good
pressure forward
it's gonna be fucking hard
front double bites up again
hard on the quads guys ground up
there it is
perfect relax
oh the hamstrings are deep good stuff
relax
good
cool
good shit
good stuff you guys both saving the
quads a lot better bonus round
jared and i actually have four arms
programmed in so we're doomed at the end
of this day today i have been for months
super productive we're gonna do uh wrist
curls dumbbells
minimal rust so i'm gonna do a set he's
gonna do a set back and forth back and
forth probably about five sets here and
uh yeah extra forearm volume people ask
if it's a good idea we have video on
that how to grow your farms but
if you have to ask the question back to
you is do you want bigger forms or you
want the rate of growth of your forms to
be higher than it is currently like if
you're quite satisfied with your forms
you don't need to do shit but if your
forms aren't like something that's a
really good muscle group on you for me
it's a little lagging i think
to be honest i think aesthetically most
people could use bigger forms except for
jared these are huge but even then the
bigger the better so we train forms it's
not very hard to three four times a week
you do five or six sets of wrist curls
you only have to rest 10 seconds between
because the lactic acid flushes out
all the byproducts flush out really fast
from the muscle you don't have to wait
around for like quads or something two
three minutes so we'll just get it done
back and forth and then we're up out of
here
[Music]
i gotta you know touch myself and stuff
later
i don't want to cramp
boom
workout over
calves
back
forearms
we're done we lost charlie at some point
along the way jk you had to go to a work
meeting
that's all we got jared how do you feel
good yeah it's a hard week of training
uh
i'll miss tomorrow's session but this
was definitely a nice little
extra week of high volume training after
my contest season so it's fun to train
with you guys and push you super yeah
super great having you folks see you
tomorrow for the last video in the
series
what kind of coke do you want i heard
that when i was in uh myrtle beach i
think this is insane i was like like
it's like saying like
a tesla
please please please it's the best a
little bit of gasoline in it
