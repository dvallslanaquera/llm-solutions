i really just can't understand why
anyone is still promoting this stuff
in the year 2021 when essentially all of
the evidence
points to the fact that bcaas just
aren't necessary at all
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and the million dollar question today is
why
is anyone still selling bcaas in the
year 2021.
these fitness youtubers and
instagrammers many who claim to be
science based who claim to be out to
help you get the best results from your
program why are bcaa supplements
still being sold and profited from when
there is no convincing human research to
support them
when the meta-analyses show that they
have no direct muscle building benefits
and that they could even be catabolic if
they're taken in isolation
when the vast majority of the
evidence-based community has
essentially agreed that they're
unnecessary as long as you're just
eating enough protein
how are people still getting away with
this and still promoting bcaas as a
bodybuilding supplement
and claiming that they accelerate muscle
growth protect lean mass and whatever
else
and why aren't they being held more
accountable you guys have known how much
i've talked about
the supplement industry and how
downright
awful it could be well we know that
breast can amino acids are one of the
most desirable
supplements that we can put in our body
as far as i'm concerned if there's any
real benefit to bcaa supplements
it's that you can use them as a gauge to
see if the person that you're following
is actually
full of what's going on everyone
vince here if they're promoting bcaas to
you and they're willing to take your
money
for those bcaas while specifically
making claims about their muscle
building effects
then either their knowledge of
supplementation is just way behind the
times and they don't actually read
supplement research
and therefore they really have no
business selling supplements in the
first place
or they do have the knowledge they are
aware of the research but they've chosen
to promote
a worthless product to you anyway just
so that they can make more money and
guys as i said before
that is the sad thing about the
supplement industry
you can buy what you think you're buying
but whether you're getting what you
think you're getting
is incredibly up in the air now i know
i've talked about bcaas
quite a few times before on this channel
and there are plenty of other crappy
supplements out there besides just bcaas
but it just blows my mind that in the
face of overwhelming evidence that they
don't work
for their intended purpose that these
well-known fitness experts are still
selling this stuff and still taking
money
from their followers for something
that's probably about as good as
drinking a glass of flavored water
if you're looking for a super easy and
scientifically supportive way to speed
up how fast you can build muscle
by recovering faster between your
workouts you need to start supplementing
bcaas
into your regimen now i also get a lot
of questions about when it's best to
take
bcaas and studies have shown that adding
extra bcaas and
even more leucine to post-workout
protein and carbs increases
muscle synthesis even further and that's
actually why i love
bcaa's biscuit nation the bcaa ratio is
two to one to one
basically all this comes down to is that
as long as you're eating enough
total protein for the day which is
really not hard to do
0.8 grams per pound of body weight or
about 1.8 grams per kilo
that's going to be enough to maximize
protein synthesis and you can go higher
than that if you prefer
but if you're consuming at least that
amount then you're already going to be
getting all the branched chain amino
acids that you need
to maximize muscle growth and just
dumping more and more on top
isn't gonna have any added benefit okay
just because some is good
doesn't automatically mean that more and
more and more is better and if you're
consuming bcaas
in isolation for example maybe between
meals or pre-workout intro workout
post-workout
um you know if you're one of these guys
walking around all day with a massive
bcaa jug in hand they're not going to be
useful in that situation either
drink it with meals to boost the leucine
content of that meal and therefore the
anabolic response you get from the meal
drink it between meals for more spikes
and muscle protein synthesis so you can
stay anabolic all day long drink it
before you exercise for less fatigue
better endurance or drink it after your
workout for better recovery and muscle
growth
bcaas do stimulate protein synthesis but
in order for the muscle building process
to actually be carried out
you need the full spectrum of amino
acids and not just the bcaas alone
it's like turning on a light switch
without actually having any electricity
flowing through
so if for some reason you're not getting
in quite enough protein per day
one option would be to use an essential
amino acid blend as a supplement
but an even better option is to just
consume more protein because it's really
not hard to do
if convenience is the issue you can just
use a protein powder like whey or casein
or egg
or a plant-based blend of some kind it's
really no less convenient
than taking a bcaa supplement and a high
quality protein powder is going to be
really high in bcaas as is and it's also
going to provide you with all of the
other essential amino acids as well
in their natural ratio so it's actually
a far superior choice anyway
um which is another really important
point that a lot of people don't realize
which is that a lot of people selling
bcaas they're not even selling a true
bcaa supplement in the first place
because they're using a skewed ratio the
natural ratio found in muscle tissue is
two to one to one meaning two parts
leucine
to one part valine and one part
isoleucine and what a lot of these
bcaa peddlers do is they ramp up the
leucine content
and then they use ratios like four to
one to one or six to one to one or
sometimes even higher than that
and in that case it's really just a
leucine supplement and leucine
is the cheapest of the three branching
amino acids and that's the real reason
why most companies do this
around three grams of leucine per
feeding that's where protein synthesis
is going to be fully maximized
and so taking any more than that is
really just pointless and i especially
love seeing bcaas promoted by people who
flat out said in the past before they
launched their supplement lines
that they don't think bcaas are
necessary and that they personally used
them
and saw no benefit you can take you know
10 grams of branched chain amino acids
but i've seen little to no benefit from
from doing that kind of supplementing
with branched amino acids
i've seen little to no benefit from from
doing that kind of
supplementing with branching amino acids
by using aminos and
gains with it i've been able to
experience really good results
interestingly enough
these i made these because of the
strongest meals on the market the
weights just keep seeing keep seeming to
increase so
so let's get this
that's really good
[Music]
there are other claims made for bca's as
well for example that they reduce muscle
soreness
but keep in mind that every study
looking at that was comparing
bcaas to a placebo and not to a whole
food protein source so there's really no
reason to think that you won't get the
same benefit
by just consuming a regular protein
containing meal within a couple hours of
finishing your workout
the only possible very niche benefit
that i could see
maybe bcaas being useful for would be
for people who are specifically on a
vegan diet where they're eating less
total protein
with lower quality sources that are
lower in bcaas in that case
you might get some benefit by adding
extra bcaas
in with your meals but also keep in mind
that uh vegan protein powders like p
protein isolate or hemp protein those
are actually pretty high in bcaas as
well
so it's actually not true that you can't
get sufficient bcaas on a vegan diet
you just need to be conscious of your
food choices so
that's really all i wanted to say on
that today i know we've gone over this
before
but i really just can't understand why
anyone is still promoting this stuff
in the year 2021 when essentially all of
the evidence points to the fact
that bcaas just aren't necessary at all
and if this video can help at least a
portion of people out there
save their money and spend it elsewhere
on things that are actually of value to
them
then i'm happy to take the time to go
ahead and post this
