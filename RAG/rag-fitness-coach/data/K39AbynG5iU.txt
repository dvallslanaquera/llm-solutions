somebody who's going from a super
massive cutting diet into maintenance or
trying to get out of that super harsh
low body fat percentage r that percent
gain is is absolutely fine right
out of the gate like the reverse dieting
stuff is silly you don't need to do it
you can go ahead and try to get your
body fat back up from like 5% to 8 or 9%
right away it's absolutely okay and if
you're just coming out of a diet and
you're super lean go ahead and
get your body fat back up to a healthy
percentage it's a pretty intelligent
idea
