hey folks dr mike israel back at it
again nutrition myth video number six
supplements yep that's the punch line
supplements are basically a myth
so let's get into it we're going to talk
about the claim
because i got to be a little bit more
specific about what i mean by
supplements
reasons the claim is wrong reasons
supplements
are mythical in many ways and some
grains of truth of course and then best
practices
as usual so here is the claim and i
would say it has at least
five factors to it five sub claims
sub claim number one that supplements
can add tons of muscle and strength
to you if you begin to take them now
folks tldr
or real talk i don't mean the shit you
buy in the behind the dumpster at the
back of the gnc
i mean over-the-counter legal in the
united states supplements
okay so all the jokes aside and they're
funny jokes
tons of jokes that i won't say
supplement supplements
not special sports supplements okay real
supplements that you can buy at the
store
it is a myth that they can add tons of
muscle and strength
uh if you begin to take them okay but
we'll get into the specifics of that in
a bit
claim number two is that supplements can
help you burn tons of fat
changing your body radically i mean you
see this in before and after pictures of
like
took you know zeta lean five and like
was a piece of shit and then now it's
like superman it's like
holy shit like this shit burns fat like
crazy it does it though
we'll see in a sec that the answer is
definitely not and i spared you the
second
number three this is a big one
and this is one that you may no longer
think but a lot of folks who are new to
the fitness industry which you may be
definitely think this i used to think
this that the
taking of supplements is a real big
difference between the people in shape
versus not in shape okay a lot of you
folks are in shape and you've traveled
around
sometimes you get into random
conversations with people whether it's a
waitress at a diner when you're wearing
a cutoff shirt
you're sitting at an airplane bus stop
school whatever
notice a lot of the times what people
say is like some combination of like oh
my god like you look great like
you're ripped and the next thing they
say like maybe
five out of ten times is like
so like like what supplements do you
take you know like do do you
do you eat protein supplements or do you
do you take a like what multivitamin do
you take
and every time i know you guys it like
it i'm one
i'm one of you in this regard shit hurts
us to hear because we're like
oh no you're being lied to okay it's not
true that what separates the halves and
half knots of fitness is
that they use supplements it's totally
not true right we know what is true
this is genetics work ethic and for
exotic differences
special sports supplements you can't buy
at walmart or gnc
number four another huge one
people are really of the opinion
that the kinds and brands of supplements
you use
are super important legitimately people
ask me all the time at the gym
what brand of protein are you
gives a flying fuck proteins all the
fucking same unless they're lying to you
and putting some shit in there which
companies do every now and again but
they do
very rarely most fundamental protein
brands are just about the same
like you don't ask a super morally obese
person like
what kind of fast food did you eat to
get like this was it taco bell was it
mcdonald's no
no no i can tell it's wendy's isn't it
they're just gonna be like look i just
eat
whatever it's all delicious and it all
fundamentally the same shit and it all
adds body fat the same thing is true
with supplements but there's this huge
myth that like the very specifics count
like
i used to be a chump and i didn't have a
girlfriend then i started taking
mono hydroxycreatine from excel labs
good god i hope that's not a real
company that's going to sue us for this
shit
uh and then i went ahead and grew 18 abs
on my face
people think that people think it it's
total bullshit
and number five kind of to tie all of
them together
people and this is subsumed in all of
these
is think that supplements are this big
tool in the toolbox
that will make the difference in your
results they think like
i have to start taking supplements right
like that's what serious fitness people
do
now i said that it's all wrong why is it
all wrong
this is a most simple shit sorry if this
disappoints you because it's not super
intricate
it's just all not true
how do we know it's not true
mechanistically
the processes the pathways that
supplements activate don't have the
throughput
and the magnitude of causative power to
make such changes
right they just don't like the only
thing the creatine monohydrate pathway
does is it boosts your performance by
like this much
because no ability has a pathway to do
anything more than that
it's uh here's a similar analogy people
say like you know like
if you use this is again a stupid
bullshit method unrelated
you know humans only use 10 of their
brain and if they used 100 they could
levitate and fly and like move shit with
their minds
you have a fucking gravity generator in
your head is there like organs we just
didn't see the human body can alter
space time
that's just not possible now can you if
you used more of your brain better again
that's a bullshit myth
could you like run a little bit faster
maybe jump a little higher or think a
little quicker be a little bit more
socially apt
okay i can believe that but fuck you're
not gonna have eye lasers coming out of
your shit cause show me the organ that
makes a laser
you guys know how much energy throughput
it takes to fucking fire a laser
by the way doesn't it burn your eyes
coming out the whole thing is
mind-boggling right
and people look at these supplements
like what kind of protein are you taking
is it going to magnify my gains because
show me in this algebraic equation how
protein is supposed to magnify your
gains
it can't it doesn't so physiologically
on a rational basis
it doesn't add up you say okay well
let's go to the research the research
is the following studies show a very
small
set of benefits for for sure a couple of
classes of supplement
wayne casein proteins work creatine
works again just a little bit
stimulants work maybe carbohydrate
powders have their place
and daily vitamins and some minerals
maybe like vitamin d
zinc etc a couple of the main ones daily
multivitamin multimineral is a good
start
those work and they have tiny effects
not eye laser shit
like thinking a little faster to party
kind of shit that's it
right that's those are really just the
confirmed supplements that work and
almost all the rest almost all the rest
do nothing we can detect
so when people say like your supplements
work really well you just
the research is like no some of them
most of them don't do shit
and some of them just do like minor
stuff that is just not anything to write
home about
and i know a lot of you folks listening
to this that are really involved in
fitness
like we've all been burnt right you're
like took your mom and dad
you're 15 years old on christmas you
know to walmart and you were like
and i have protein powder and mom was
like i don't know
it's got chemicals and dad was like
you're gonna play football next year
right and you're like yeah and he's like
all right and get this one
and you eat it and you mix it and it's
clumpy and you drink it this is
basically my childhood
and then like three weeks later you're
like
i guess doing something and you really
just can't tell and you don't take it
for a while but you eat lots of mom's
home cooking meat and milk and
you lift weights and you make the best
gains ever and you're like i feel like
i've been lied to right we all know that
but a ton of people don't know that and
that's why this video exists now there
are some grains of truth to the fact
that supplements do work
right first there are a few peripheral
supplements not in that confirmed
category
with maybe effects or effects on special
applications
beta-alanine might be okay for a repeat
endurance if you're a wrestler 400 meter
run or something like that
citrulline malate not doing so well in
the research literally but it's got a
pretty decent research volume down it
might do some good things for
hypertrophy and performance
fish oils they're up and down but they
might be a small net balance
various healthy fat supplements might be
a decent idea and
when needed fiber supplements may have
their place when needed which is usually
uh almost never
and the other supplements listed
creatine waste stimulus etc
they do work so it's not like all
supplements are bullshit it's just a
really tiny effect
in the grand scheme and it's barely
noticeable for most people especially
like you know stimulants make you feel
wacky for sure that's not a mild effect
but how is that going to change your
body over the long term is really what
we're talking about here like yeah
you may feel like god for three hours
after taking a pre-workout but
how much more magnitude of growth
stimulus did you engage
did you activate during that set workout
and the real answer is
maybe this much more a tiny bit it's
just like you don't look at a guy who's
jack you're like betty takes a lot of
pre-workout
now he's taking some other shit you feel
me pre-workout's not
bridging that gap so yeah they do work
it's just a tiny amount so there is a
little grain of truth to there
now number four lastly best practices
let's round this out
two-part focus here first part you
can choose to use a few of the effective
subs you can absolutely use them and
we're not saying
we're not anti-supplement all right i'm
not anti-supplement supplements work we
just you have to understand how much
they work
okay and it's not much so it's best to
approach them with first of all
realistic expectations like if you're
looking at a bottle of whey protein like
if you're 13 or 14 you're looking at a
bottle of wheat protein
with stars in your eyes it's just part
of growing up it's adorable i'm not
gonna break your heart i'm not gonna
tell you santa's not really either if
you're
six years old you know but if you're
like 23 and you're looking at a thing of
weight protein like here we go baby
gain time you you need to be washed
clean of that expectation it's just
it's just not going to happen that way
for you right if you take them regularly
as instructed the people ask me about
creatine all the time and i'm like
okay yeah you have to take it
essentially daily five grams a day for
months and then it works uh you know
decently well and they're gone man like
i miss it all the time i miss doses all
the time what do you think and i'm like
if you miss creatine doses it literally
has zero effect an acute dose of
creatine does nothing nothing
so if it's not like pre-workout where
you take it once you're like ah
you take creatine once and nothing
happens to you it's a matter of building
a cellular intracellular concentrations
which takes
multiple doses to do so it's just not
going to work so you have to be
consistent if you're going to do it
realistic expectations
and manage going off uh coming onto them
well and off of them well coming on to
them gross
stimulants for example uh you don't need
to go to pre-workout right away you can
just do like
diet coke or coffee or something with
caffeine and then when you need it
you up the stimulant and then you know
you go to a pre-workout maybe do half a
scoop and then maybe a couple months
later deep in our cut you do a full
scoop or a scoop and a half
worked up to it don't take it when
you're supposed to be
sleeping a few hours later because you
won't be able to sleep it'll screw up
your recovery
and then once you're done cutting you
switch back to massing go back to coffee
or diet coke or something and then wean
off a little bit give your body a break
and then get back on when you need to
right so just using them especially
stimulants all the time tends to negate
their effects to some significant extent
so
if you use them properly they can be of
benefit
of benefit small benefit but nonetheless
benefit you don't need to
use them you don't have to use them but
they can help
here's the thing though how are they
going to help if your training is
fucking rock solid and you're kicking it
in the gym
consistent and hard with adequate
recovery
and your diet is so important
right a multivitamin a few protein
shakes and a few doses of pre-workout
maybe creatine you're damn near squared
away with all the supplements you need
to take
if your diet is good you're going to see
great gains and this should have been a
myth of its own i didn't put it in but
i'll say it now
if you think supplements are going to
replace a good diet
or replace sleep and rest or replace
training you've got another thing coming
all together
precisely the people that ask you and i
about what to do in the gym
are going to be the people that plan
five workouts a week and make two or
three
you know these motherfuckers they're the
ones asking you
hey man what brand of creatine do you
take you know what brand i take get the
fuck out of my face
see you guys next time
you
