hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization nutrition myth
number seven
eat more to lose more weight what
let's get into the thick of things here
we're going to talk about the claim
itself and what people really say
we'll talk about why it's wrong we'll
talk about why
it might not be so wrong and it does
have elements of truth and then we'll
talk about
the way forward with best practices to
solve these sorts of problems
and stay away from the myths so the
claim here is that if you die
too hard for too long your metabolism
begins to slow okay
so far so good and that further
decreases in food intake
from that point
then you stop losing weight altogether
interesting claim
and then further increases or sorry
further decreases of food from there
taking your food even lower can make you
gain weight
increasing food making any weight sounds
strange
okay and that what makes you lose weight
and the way to get out of this is by
eating more food not less
so most people when they start to get a
plateau of weight loss they'll say okay
i need to cut my calories further
this myth says no no you need to
increase your calories that's how you
lose more weight by
increasing calories i'm not lampooning
this is actually a belief
and if you're a chronic dieter the claim
is that increasing your calories can
literally make you begin to lose weight
for the first time in weeks or months
interesting claims now why is the
fundamental reason here that these
claims are underlying
why are they wrong well if
by cutting your food you gain weight how
is starvation a thing in third world
countries
okay you re decrease the food to really
small amounts you should be able to go
to a third world country
man everyone here is really fat it's
because they're not eating enough
that's what it is but when you go to
actual places where people are actually
eating at a chronic
deficit they are very skinny and often
times unhealthily so and oftentimes they
die
because they don't have enough food
because when you don't have enough food
when you're a deficit you lose weight
you don't gain weight it's literally the
opposite
the reason is that the laws of
thermodynamics are real
you can't really gain tissue by eating
less and less and less
there are some small exceptions to that
in the short term in the long term
thermodynamics always wins
unless some other fishy things are going
on so
the grain of truth here to those fishy
things when
you diet for an extensive period of time
reducing calories increasing activity
and you have a deficit
your non-exercise activity thermogenesis
neat
isn't that neat i had to make that joke
my apologies
your neat goes down which means you just
start moving around less
almost subconsciously and what that does
is it used to
you used to lose weight quite quickly
because your physical activity was very
high
now you may have stuck to the same low
calories but unbeknownst to you
subconsciously your knee goes down your
physical activity goes down
the magnitude of the deficit actually
reduces which
usually slows the weight loss down from
what it was
at very rarely makes you stop losing
weight
then it is very very difficult to
actually gain weight
if you stick to your deficit of calories
neat
almost never eliminates that completely
and puts you into a surplus
highly highly unlikely crazy rare right
but worth noting that at least the
weight
loss rate will start to decline which
could be like ah something's going on
aha enter hormones with hormone
manipulations
water dynamics can change the longer you
diet the more your stress hormones tend
to elevate some of these stress hormones
in some people not all
cause an increase in water retention
what this means is that for
the same amount of water you drink and
salt you take in your body stores more
of that
which can mask some fraction of your
weight loss
you're like well you know by my
calculations you should be losing a
pound a week
but i'm only losing half a pound a week
what the hell and it is you are actually
losing a pound of tissue a week
but you're gaining or retaining some
body water
and body water usually goes to the same
places where you get fat
so you're like i still have the same
fucking love handles what the hell
but now the love handles are a large
part larger part water than fat than
they used to be
and as soon as you stop dieting and go
back to maintenance and your body heals
up and your hormones go back to normal
you get this kind of whoosh effect where
your love handles like almost completely
disappear and you're like holy crap i
guess i had been leaner this whole time
i just didn't know
now this can be complicated it is not
just
that your hormones make you store more
water it is actually complicated in at
least a few more ways made worse
first you can start
to take in more salt okay
because you get hungrier for salt when
you
are hypocaloric salty foods taste better
you take in more salt and now all of a
sudden
your body is more likely to store water
because water follows salt
another problem you may actually
increase your
fluid intake because of diet drinks now
look diet drinks are amazing they're
great
but what you have is you're now drinking
a lot more fluids
to get the sugary taste not because
you're thirsty and there's a really easy
way to tell which one it is
if you're looking at your uh bottle of
diet coke or diet sprite
you're like should i have this and
you're on a diet harsh diet
very very restricted you really want
sugary foods
you're like well i don't know if i
should have this because i'm thirsty or
because i'm hungry for sugar
well ask yourself this take away the
diet sprite replace it with a glass of
regular water
do you still want that if you're thirsty
you're gonna want a glass of water you
don't just go into a two-hour wrestling
practice hold out a glass of water and
everyone's like i'm good
people are like oh my god water because
they're actually thirsty
if you look at a glass of water and
you're like no interest
a matter of fact i would have to force
that down but you look at a bottle
of diet sprite or something and you're
like oh i would love that
you're actually craving sugar and not
water you were not dehydrated
you were just under calorie which is
totally fine but here's the thing
you start to consume a whole lot more
fluids because of
the fact that they have fake sugar fake
sugar by itself isn't a problem at all
it's not unhealthy for you but it ends
up ramping up your fluid intake because
you're using these fluids
to sort of satiate your carb intake okay
it works sort of
and then at the same time that dilutes
the salt that you have in your body
and remember you have an independent
salt driver when you're hypocaloric when
you're really dieted down you already
want more salt
but now that you're taking in so many
fluids your body salt concentration
actually goes down and your
body goes extra out of its way to fix
that so what does that end up doing
you end up drinking a whole lot more
water and taking in a whole lot more
salt
and now what's literally a recipe for
just storing more body water in addition
to that
hormonally you are primed to also
independently at a hormonal access
store more body water because if you
took in a bunch more salt and a bunch
more water and you were
morally normal you just like it'd be a
huge pain in the ass you'd just pee a
ton
and you'd be like wow this is annoying
and you just would stop wanting it
but with the hormonal stuff that
sometimes happens dieting
your body holds on to that salt and
water mixture much more than usual
okay what this can do is it can make
your weights completely stable for weeks
on end even though you're losing you can
lose two pounds a week
and gain two pounds of body water no
problem if you start on this
salt and water stuff and what does the
salt stuff look like start salting your
foods more
you eat a bunch of pickles like pickles
have almost no calories but if you eat a
jar of pickles
that is an inordinate amount of salt and
you get really thirsty and then you
reach
for diet sprite and you drink a crap ton
more of that now
under the hood nothing is happening
you're losing fat just as fast as you
ever were but
you're not losing weight anymore
sometimes you can even gain weight like
that
and you can certainly stay stable which
can be incredibly frustrating and now
you start thinking all these things like
it's my low calories i've cut my
calories i'm not losing any weight
the laws of thermodynamics must be
broken nope it's a salt water and
hormone issue
and it's temporary and under the hood
good things are happening
but it's really hard to tell yourself
that when you first of all look watery
which is
real tough to tell apart from fat and
also the scale isn't moving so it's real
bad news it can really really mind fuck
you in a serious way
in addition lastly we have to mention
this one this is for people who are
compliant who are actually sticking to
their deficit
the thing is when people say like every
time i'm in a deficit i gain weight
they're not actually in a deficit they
do a couple of days of deficit
they get way too much of a deficit and
they get
radically hungry and they overeat and
now they're in a surplus
like anyone who tells you like i don't
lose weight on a 600 calorie diet i've
had people tell me that like i'll do
800 calories a day for five days and i
don't lose any weight or i'll do it like
i'm under a hair calorie diet i'm not
losing weight like i got you
and then you just ask the next follow-up
question okay so how long do you go with
800 calories before you snap and they're
like
like five or six days like and then what
do you do they're like well then i just
eat everything like
how much of everything if you run the
numbers they can actually be
at a maintenance calorie level through
the week by monday through friday eating
800 calories a day or whatever
and then saturday sunday it's just pure
utter insanity
and when your body is in starvation mode
or just very hungry
you can eat a ton of food especially if
it's the most delicious food and
remember what does your body crave
when you're at a low calorie state the
most delicious possible food
pizza look good to all of us who aren't
dieting but
to those of us that are dieting and
chronically dieting and cutting calories
way too low
pizza looks like some kind of religious
expression of just
catharsis like you're like i can i can
liberate my soul if i just
eat 50 slices of this and it's always
overboard so a bunch of folks that say
look when i cut my calories too much i
gain weight it's the body water stuff
that's happening
but it's also the fact that yeah they
cut their calories they get super hungry
they go way overboard on calories and
then they gain weight or stay stable
and remember gaining weight in the short
term is very easy this way
because when you eat two days worth of
junk food the amount of salt that brings
in is
crazy and carbohydrates that all
temporarily expands your fluid volume
and your muscle volume and all of a
sudden you gain tons of weight
and when you eat a ton of junk food what
do you get super thirsty so you drink a
ton more water and you brought the salt
in to keep that water there
the whole thing's a mess which is why
after a binge weekend oftentimes you're
like a bloated
you know balloon animal and and you've
gained weight and you're like it's the
deficit that's making me do this and
you're not completely wrong
you're wrong in the direct sense but not
in the indirect sense so where do you go
from here
okay because this is not a sustainable
situation it can and really
does play tricks with your mind so first
don't slash your calories like crazy
the fraction of people who are well
treated by goals of
a thousand calories deficit or more per
day is tiny
most people that'll just cause burnout
and everything bad most people should be
sticking between a 500 or 1000 calorie
deficit
per day now a thousand calorie deficit
per day is losing like
two pounds of tissue per week good god
i mean if you do that for 12 weeks
that's 24 pounds
potentially a fat color that is
unbelievably impressive and if you
repeat that sort of diet
twice a year for a few years you can
lose any amount of weight that you want
okay there's no good reason to go faster
now
there is a good reason to go faster is
if you want a careen out of control
start binging start cheating and screw
yourself over long term definitely right
i would analogize this to speeding and
going somewhere on the freeway
like should you be going somewhere
you're late to a party
do you really want to be there should
you be driving at 30 miles an hour on
the fury no that's stupid
okay so anything less than 500 calories
is kind of like what are you doing
you're just wasting time
500 calories to a thousand calories is
like driving between 60 and 80 miles an
hour yeah 80s over the speed limit most
places but let's be realistic it's not
that dangerous it's fine
okay anything over a thousand calories
deficit is kind of like driving
80 plus but like a lot more than 80 plus
like if you want to make a party and
you're going 120 miles an hour on a
regular freeway
for friends sitting with you probably
gonna be like dude what the fuck are you
doing like you're trying to get us
killed
good god parties aren't that fun like
you're not in the indy 500
slow down right because even the freeway
curves come up real fast at 120.
so it's just not a very good idea
especially if you're trying to lose fat
in the long term
that's like doing a whole road trip at
120 miles an hour it's a good way to get
yourself killed
so don't do it right same here 5 000 1
000 calorie deficit
through both reduction of food and an
increase of physical activity because a
lot of times increasing physical
activity
is really healthy it burns almost pure
fat and it often doesn't come
with an increase in hunger believe it or
not so if you just
drop your intake by 300 and raise your
activity by 300 calories which end up
having a 600 calorie deficit which means
you lose over a pound of fat per
week on average but you don't really
feel like
super restricted which is really really
good sustainability is number one
unless you want unsustainable fat loss
in which case you just get fat again
mission accomplished right point number
two
yeah sustainability is a thing but you
don't want to die for longer than about
12 weeks at a time
after that you want to take a break at
maintenance to let your metabolism and
your mind heal
and that's going to take at least two
thirds as long so at least eight weeks
if you did dieted for the whole 12 and
up to one and a half times as long
which is damn near 18 or 20 weeks or
something like that
if you know that after a hard diet you
need your time to heal because you've
gone back to dieting a few weeks after
and you're
totally rebounded stop doing it take a
longer maintenance here's the thing
if you are really over fat you really
need to make a change
and you take your let's say you're 35
years old take
five full years of fat loss maintenance
fat loss maintenance take your time
because after five years you'll be 40
and you'll have been you'll have lost 80
pounds or something yeah you could have
done it in one year
but then i want you to just balloon back
up 80 pounds over 5 years
sustainable you keep it off for the next
20 or 30. oh my god you just bought
yourself an elixir of health for decades
people always think there's a rush to
lose weight and there almost never is
and as a matter of fact the rush is a
big part of the problem
okay so that 12 weeks at a time diet
that's kind of like
don't drive for any longer than 12 hours
at a time especially if you're the only
driver
on a road trip can you do it yeah sure
caffeinate up then you'll like start
seeing shit you have no idea what time
it is
it's not safe to be on the road and it's
a recipe for not good things same idea
here
now tracking your activity is really
good because
a lot of times you're like okay i know
what i'm eating but is my neat
decreased i'm not losing weight as much
as i think or i don't even want to get
into that situation where i'm not losing
weight as much i think
i want to make sure my activity doesn't
fall
great way to do it is voila activity
tracker if you're going to ask me in the
comments where it's from i have no idea
some chinese companies
shit like that it doesn't even say on
here you can get one of these
step watches from damn near anywhere you
might as well build one yourself
they're super cheap they're super
effective it tells you how many steps
you're moving around
and if you say okay normally when i'm
just maintaining
i they take an average of 10 000 steps
per day it's the easiest thing in the
world all you got to do is peg it at 10
000 and make sure that during your
12-week diet you never fall below on
average so every week you average 10 000
steps a day
that really just pretty much guarantees
that your knee won't drop off that far
your weight loss will be much more
predictable it's much better than not
having a tracker
and then you start losing weight a
little slowly and you're like am i
overeating
or is my activity lower it's just a
question you won't have to ask because
you'll have an objective measurement of
your activity
plain and simple now point number four
if you're prone
to water balance issues some people do
the water balloon thing they just start
gaining
water weight on a diet i do it's a huge
problem for me here's what you can do
first keep your stress as low as
possible and your sleep as high as
possible because that fixes a bunch of
stuff keeps cortisol low all that good
stuff
you'll still get some of it though so
what you might want to do standardize
your salt intake
like look if you are uncontrollably
eating salt
it's not affecting under the hood you're
still losing fat but it sucks to like
take
progress pics week after week and you
like sort of look the same sort of worse
for three weeks straight
that can burn you out and cause you to
go cheat and fall off the wagon
so if you're really on that situation
standardize your salt intake stick to
mostly the same foods put the same
little scoop of salt every time into
your
rice and later that day another meal of
pasta
same scoop of salt and they just know
how much salt you're eating you don't
even need to count it just it's
roughly the same every time what that'll
do is it'll really prevent you from
gaining water weight
nearly to the same extent because you're
never ever escalating your salt
and then you'll lose much more
predictably you'll be that much happier
yeah is it fun to eat pickles on a diet
sure
and if you don't gain water weight from
it fine and if you gain water weight but
you don't care cause you trust your
numbers under the hood you have an
activity tracker and you know your
calories
totally but if you really don't want all
that water getting in the way of like
you visually just being motivated week
to week for your progress
track your salt and maybe to some extent
track your water
just like you know fill up a gallon
that's why bodybuilders do it you fill
up a gallon jug of water or put some
squirties in there and make it taste
nice
um and you just drink it throughout the
day and so every day you have roughly
the same amount of water
so that there's less mystery that's all
it does none of this stuff actually
helps you lose fat or anything like that
it's just less mystery your physique
looks predictably different the scale
moves predictably
and you don't have to say guess yourself
lastly
on the issue of the scale you've got to
be patient with the scale
before making a change to your diet or
activity
wait for two weeks because the scale can
stall for up to two weeks at a time
and then due to water balance maybe
you've reduced your stress you take a
deload
you go down by four pounds in two or
three days and you're like holy crap
what did i do differently nothing
it was all water weight the whole time
you had been losing two pounds a week
that's in this entire time it just
finally came off
be patient with the scale don't look too
too much into it
if you are establishing a really robust
deficit your physical activity is
tracked
and you're doing a good job of it you're
training you're almost certainly losing
weight
be patient if you really want control
your water and salt intake
and then you're gonna be gucci just by
sticking to the plan
you won't retain your weight eating a
thousand calories a day
it doesn't happen you are losing weight
under the hood if you fix the salt
and you fix the water balance stuff it's
going to be immediately apparent or if
you just trust the process
i promise it'll work no by cutting your
calories
you can't gain weight folks thanks for
tuning in for this myth
see you next time for another one
you
