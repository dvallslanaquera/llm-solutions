hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
prioritization rp plus
hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture 15 excessively low frequencies
what is too low contents here first
we'll talk about why the fuss like
why is there a concern for excessively
low frequencies
we'll talk about the seven potential
reasons why excessive low frequencies
can exist
and i will talk about some basic
recommendations to make sure you're not
making that mistake
so first of all why the fuss well
if you do more volume per session
generally speaking you get more growth
and
that means that for a while you can get
about the same results increasing your
per session volume as you
increase the number of uh days of
training you do per week for the same
muscle group
so you can essentially get the same
results with lower frequencies which is
awesome because you just don't have to
show up to the gym as much
and or when you show up to the gym you
can train different muscle groups
instead of pounding away in the same
muscle group all the time
especially with regard to sort of joint
longevity
and fatigue of connective tissues
there's a big advantage to that because
if you train really really frequently
you're actually able to perform pretty
well each time and that means you're
training heavy a lot and really hard a
lot and your connective tissues and
joints
tend to not stand up to it nearly as
much as the muscles can so
there is definitely a benefit to not
training with excessively high
frequencies we'll cover that in the next
lecture
but we could say wow you know lower
frequencies are great i can just do
lower and lower frequency and more and
more rounding per session and i'll keep
getting these uh amazing sort of same
results as high frequency but with much
less joint fatigue connective tissue
fatigue so on and so forth unfortunately
that train
uh that trend does not extrapolate
forever
at some point your per session
volumes become too high and
the per session volumes like in order to
stimulate a person for a certain degree
might not have to do five sets per
session anymore not 10 but 15 if you're
training very infrequently
and in most of the problems of
excessively high frequency come from
those excessive per session volumes that
are required
to keep the results the same with a
lower frequency
as they would be with a higher frequency
there are seven specific factors we can
look at
to see how that all goes wrong let's
take a look at them
one at a time luckily they're displayed
on the same slide so
problem number one is that as you train
for longer and longer and longer within
a certain session
your systemic fatigue starts to go up
and systemic fatigue especially fatigue
of the nervous system which absolutely
occurs
can start to prevent you from
very maximally or close to maximally
activating the muscles that you're
trying to train
if you have problems activating them
making them contract hard or go close to
failure
of that actual muscles physiological
ability to go close to failure which is
what causes a lot of growth by the way
then we have a problem because as you do
enough volume and then a little too much
falling a little too much volume a
little too much volume
as the volume gets excessive what ends
up happening is
the benefit of each set starts to
decline and decline and decline
because your true proximity to failure
goes really far away oh sure you feel
like you're failing and you really are
but the failure isn't occurring because
the local muscles are close to failure
it's because other systemic factors
cardiovascular system especially the
nervous system
are what's lagging behind so when your
systemic fatigue starts to go up
each set becomes less and less
productive to the point where sets are
so unproductive but
still some a ton of fatigue because it
still work that we end up having this
term
for those sets called junk volume now
there's no such thing as junk volume or
not junk volume
volume has a quality to it the first few
sets you do in a session are really high
quality usually the middle sets are very
high quality
their stimulus is high and the relative
contribution to fatigue is whatever it
is right
relatively low compared to the stimulus
but as the
sets wear on and on and on you get more
and more tired not locally but
systemically
your ability to squeeze juice out of the
muscles and get a hypertrophy stimulus
per set
starts to decline which is to say your
stimulus starts to go like this
but your fatigue per set is about the
same each one's a hard working set
and that ends up costing a ton and
eventually your sets become more
junky so like the stimulus is this and
the fatigue is that
that's not a good idea because you could
just stop right there
not accumulate all that extra crazy
fatigue come back to train again sooner
with a higher frequency
and get more high quality work so
systemic fatigue
rising causes at least one problem which
is junk volume
however that is not remotely the only
problem that rising systemic fatigue
causes
problem number two caused again by
rising systemic fatigue
from excessively high per session
volumes is a degradation of technique
rising systemic fatigue very predictably
again through the nervous system
degrades your technical ability remember
from earlier lectures
good technique is causative
of a higher stimulus to fatigue ratio as
your technique degrades
your stimulus declines and your fatigue
escalates right imagine squatting for
15 sets and again that's kind of crazy
someone's tried it i'm sure after 10
sets
even sooner gee whiz your technique's
going to start to break down you're
going to start good morning more squats
you're just trying to survive
you're so fatigued your technique sucks
which is to say that every single rep in
every single set doesn't impose as much
stress on the targeted muscles anymore
that's the definition of good technique
and imposes stress on other structures
which may not really benefit
and thus the fatigue is higher the
stimulus is lower
not good okay if you don't even have an
ability to pull off good technique
the session is over at least the
exercise is over probably the session
now point three the last thing rising
systemic fatigue does which is bad
is it decreases your mind muscle
connection a lot of that is because that
neural drive isn't there anymore
remember a high degree of mind muscle
connection is
when you can feel a ton of tension in
the target muscle
with low reps and with higher reps when
you can feel a crazy burn
in the target muscle when you do 15 or
20 sets in a single session
at the end of that your muscles might be
pretty trashed
but your nervous system you're so tired
that you're not even able to focus on
contracting the right muscles
in a bench press which is good for your
pecs because you have good technique so
on and so forth
that's great for your pecs turns into
just moving the weight any way you can
and then someone's like man did you feel
your chest on that and you're like i
don't even know what i felt i'm just
trying to get these reps in
not the best way to train keep the high
quality first half of that workout
stop rest a couple days come back and
have the same high quality workout again
in a progressively related fashion with
slightly higher frequency
if the last five sets of your workout
are just total dog shit
why are you doing them you could just
rest a little
less between sessions and do more high
quality sets
same idea right it's like you have a
certain amount of food per day you can
have two meals or four meals
if you have two meals you're overstuffed
like crazy and each meal sucks because
you can't eat that much
but if you have four meals it's the
perfect amount of food every time why
would you eat two
doesn't make a whole lot of sense all
right so that's systemic fatigue
what about local fatigue local fatigue
is partially causative of hypertrophy
until it gets to such a high degree
that it prevents the very muscle
contraction from happening optimally
and starts to impose its own cost on
hypertrophy stimulus
if your local fatigue is super super
high you have trouble
the nervous system has trouble
activating the muscle itself because so
so much junk in the neuromuscular
junction and in the muscle itself
that when the muscle or the nerve says
fire fire fire the muscle's like
a not a whole lot happens you're not
generating a ton of tension anymore
which is probably stimulus number one
fiber tree you're
generating a lot of metabolites anymore
because the metabolites have gone into
so many places
they basically have gunked up the works
right so
local fatigue it's like if you have if
the driver is the nervous system
and the engine is the muscle itself
local fatigue is like the engine
just overheated and there's oil
everywhere and gas everywhere
and it's just time to let the engine
rest clean it out and so on and so forth
but even if the driver is good to go
it doesn't matter because the engine's
messed up at this point now just like
with
uh you know cars usually with people the
driver is the limiting factor but
if you somehow can keep cranking away
and you know enough pre-workout and
limp biscuit on the radio and you're
you're good to go for 20 sets
there may be a point in which the local
fatigue is so high that you're not
getting
a huge amount of tension or amount of
metabolites your muscles just basically
throwing up two middle fingers to the
wind they're just done
if you keep training after that you're
just not getting a whole lot rest
come back hit it again much better than
continuing on
point number five let's say you get
through all the stuff no worries you've
got enough pre-workout
and and corn to keep you going i don't
mean the food i mean the bad
excellent band corn you should look into
them starts with a k
don't troll me if you turn out to not
like the music
they're amazing objectively scientists
have proven this so
let's say you know by grace of god or
the grace of corn same thing
you get through a ton of sets you'll run
into problem number five at some point
your muscles can only generate so much
anabolic stimulus or rather receive it
and can only generate so much growth at
some point you've essentially tapped out
every growth process
and it just needs time to execute muscle
growth if you keep
tapping into it and keep pressing it the
lever is already fully depressed there's
nowhere to go the
perfect analogy is taking a gas pedal
and placing it all the way down
there's no more to go there's no further
place to go
so stop hitting the pedal because you're
at max speed already and that's it
it's tired the time trial is over you
just need to re-evaluate some things and
come back and so on and so forth
so at some point anabolic synthesis hit
there is some good literature on where
anabolic signaling max is at least
in a small sample of studies from
intermediates and beginners and it seems
like on average for most mesocycles
something around eight sets working sets
relatively close to failure per session
are where the anabolic signaling mass
per session
is right around 8. does that mean that
12 to 15 cents per session isn't even
higher in many cases no it may very well
be
but if your hypothesis is that you know
25
sets per muscle group and this is per
muscle group by the way
25 sets per muscle group
is uh you know going to get you
more growth in that session than 10
right remember it seems like you hit a
ceiling at eight
gee if you had a ceiling at eight then
10 maybe a little higher
in some cases 12 maybe not likely
16 18 probably
just best case the same right so let's
say you're doing 20.
well you could have done 10 and gotten
the exact same results with literally
half the work
or half the number of sets why would you
keep going
when it gets like someone who has a
pedal pressed all the way down and
they're still pressing it as hard as
possible
there's at the very least nothing good
that can come of that in in fact
point number six shows us that something
bad can happen from that
it's been demonstrated pretty clearly
then we need more studies to flesh out
exactly how this happens
and the relative magnitudes that
excessive damage and this this is
very very logical on theoretical grounds
excessive damage
probably interferes with hypertrophy a
lot of the same mechanisms in your
muscles
that make muscle grow also recover
a muscle heal damaged muscle if you
damage
so much muscle way more than you have to
let's say your anabolic signal max is at
10 cents per session you went to 20
you did so much damage that instead of
growing you a lot
your body's going to be like crap we got
to recover first we have to heal
and then if we have extra resources left
over maybe we'll grow
the interesting thing is is from an
evolutionary perspective this makes a
ton of sense your body probably
prioritizes healing damage
over adaptation because it's you know
super important to do that you
you don't come in a race car doesn't
come in you know out of the pit or let's
say after a day on the track
and the driver is like man you know
there's all kinds of gunk everywhere all
the screws are loose
let's let's rev the engine up to make it
a little bit more you know produce more
power i've got an
idea like shouldn't we be putting the
bolts back in first
nonsense right that's a way to drive the
race car and your body completely to the
ground
your body by evolution thinks really
won't let you do that
at some point if you train way too much
procession you use most of your recovery
abilities
to heal the excessive damage you've
caused in very little progressively less
as you do more and more volume is left
over for
actual muscle growth which is to say if
you train enough
per session you may have done all that
work for literally zero gains if
absolutely possible
maybe not a good idea to do right so
maybe
you don't want to have a ton of volume
per session at some point
right and then we have point number
seven the fatigue versus hypertrophy
time course if you watch the last
lecture
lecture number 14 this will make perfect
sense to you
at some point what ends up happening is
you get more and more growth per session
if you raise the volume until as we've
seen with at least number five
and for sure number six you're capped
out
you just don't grow any more muscle but
what happens if you keep doing more work
the time course of fatigue extends
further and further and further
it may take four days for you to recover
from 10 sets per session
if you go to 15 sets per session it may
take you
six days to recover but for no added
growth
if you're maybe for a little added
growth certainly not enough to cost
two more days in your plan if you go to
20 sets per session
it may take you a whole week to recover
with almost certainly
zero added growth on top so your
hypertrophy time course
is the same you still grow the same
amount of muscle and you're done growing
muscle about the same time
but your fatigue time course with extra
bit of volume gets extended extended
extended
so that you're able to train less
frequently because you can only train
when you recover
but you get no more added ability right
so all of these together are
major major downsides for trying to do a
very low frequency and make up for it
with a high per session volume the thing
is
you say well i don't want to make up for
it with higher perception volume but
then you're just not doing much volume
and you're doing that very infrequently
so we're back to hypertrophy concept and
tools lecture 14
where we just do a certain number of
sets and spread out the recovery between
them so much
that we're just missing out on potential
growth opportunities
so where does that take us as far as
recommendations
how do we avoid doing this well here's
number one
most g probably in in all of the stuff
we've put in rp most actionable item you
can ever take home with you about
training program design if a muscle
you're training isn't sore
and if performance is back up to the
usual baseline or over
it's probably time to train it again
soon
we're never going to be sticklers and
never going to get dogmatic and say as
soon as performance is back to baseline
you got to train
maybe it's worth waiting an extra day
just to be careful maybe you want to
just
take accumulative fatigue and reduce a
little bit but if you're waiting day and
day
and day and day after you're good to go
it's not a good idea here's a really
super quick example you guys will
probably
uh really relate with if you train quads
let's say once a week
you might get sore and maybe even grow
for like four or five days
and you say like so what two days the
weekend and then i'm back to going
i agree with you it's not a big deal you
don't have to train quads if that's the
case
twice a week but what about like if you
train biceps once a week
and someone asks you on monday train
biceps and someone asks you on wednesday
like
are you sore on your biceps you're like
nope like can you
perform at a usual level you're like
yeah actually last week i trained
twice that week on a monday hit really
good workout and wednesday had a great
workout so yeah probably
and then they're like okay so when do
you train biceps again you're like next
monday
i said they would be like so wouldn't
you just grow really well right now if
you train them you're like yeah but
um it's good to rest is it really it's
good to rest until you recover but what
if you're not recovering anymore
it's almost the same thing as um if you
guys ever wake up in the morning and
you're fully rested you had a great
night's sleep
do you ever try sleeping longer it's
fucking stupid it's pointless
right you just piss away two hours and
then you wake up groggier and shittier
than ever at the very least
you just caught two hours out of your
day you could have been doing awesome
stuff like playing video games
avoiding responsibility crying you know
stuff people usually do
when they wake up and i have no one to
love them like me
so it's one of those things where maybe
yeah there's definitely some wiggle room
but when you're done being sore and when
you're ready to hit it hard again
go to the gym soon one or two days later
at the very
longest and train again if you do that
then you
almost certainly avoid uh the the
problem of excessively low frequencies
right almost avoided the second point is
critical however
you can do this but still do a ton of
session volume and it just takes you
that long to recover
so you might still be going infrequently
because you're just overdoing it so the
way to not overdo per session volume
is to just tell yourself that you're not
going to go much over
12 to 15 sets per session per muscle
right and that's right from the
the research does that mean you have to
cap everything at eight
like the james krieger review says
probably not but if you're consistently
doing
10 sets per session or more on average
you know maybe you could do less and do
a higher frequency
if you're consistently doing 12 to 15
cents per session on average that's
probably a bit high
if you're doing over 15 sets per muscle
group right 15 sets of
chest every time you train you're
probably better off just
doing like 10 or like 8 and then coming
in more frequently because you'll
recover faster from those 10 and 8
that will probably be better on the net
balance same idea as getting over stuff
for a meal for no reason you can just
cut the amount you eat per meal and eat
more frequent meals that's it
right and
if you want a super awesome
recommendation because you could like
read this stuff and be like
okay let's not tell me exactly how many
times i should train per week
i gotta track performance of source
which i'm gonna do but like what about
just a real world
number get us a number here's the deal
most muscles need at least
twice per week training to get their
best results
right if you try to squeeze in all the
volume into one per week it probably
doesn't work
optimally right why do so many folks
especially pro bodybuilders train just
once a week per muscle group
one of the biggest reasons it's going to
sound unfortunate when i say it but it's
nonetheless probably true
is those folks have trouble switching it
off they're such hard workers
and they so much love the pain and the
pump and so on and so forth which is
great
that they tend to overdo it per session
and they're very keen on recovery
because they don't want to get weaker
over time so
they essentially say okay well i train
legs with 15 to 20 cents per session
because when i fucking show up it's hard
go hard or go home right
and then they realize that if they train
with that much volume per session the
fatigue takes a week to
uh to recover and then they say well you
know training more than once a week is
stupid
because you just won't recover enough
well what if you instead of doing 20
sets of quads do 10 sets of quads
and they would be like well why would
you do that well because it's better the
research says it's better and
try it and a lot of people who try it it
seems to take the wind out of their
sails a little bit as far as like how
how much they can really destroy a
muscle
but remember we're not in the gym for
therapy we're in the gym to get the best
hypertrophic stimulus and if you're in
the gym for therapy not to get the best
hypertrophic stimulus you can fucking
turn this video off
as soon as you like if you've watched
all the way up to now with all the other
15 guys holy crap sorry to waste your
time
but if your goal is optimal muscle
growth you have to know when to say when
knowing when to say when means you might
not be able to torch a muscle group
completely every time although i would
say 10 hard sets per muscle is
fucking brutal maybe you shouldn't be in
the gym for 20 sets and so on and so
forth maybe it's time to
cut out go home grow recover
and then when you're healed earlier this
time
maybe you'll be able to smash two
sessions right and that 2x per week is
probably a minimum for best gains a lot
of muscles
benefit from higher still frequencies if
you follow that roughly
eight-ish ten-ish uh sets per session
paradigm
if you do a lot of muscles benefit from
two times a week
a lot of muscles and individuals and
points in time benefit
three times a week of heart training
four times and sometimes
even more than that how do you know how
much well you train a muscle with
whatever given volume you want
you see when the soreness goes back
essentially back to no soreness at all
you see when your performance is back to
normal which requires a little bit of
wiggle room and some experimentation and
then some muscles you're going to be
like holy crap i can train this muscle
five times a week and that's awesome
uh maybe your side delts your rear delts
your biceps in many cases sometimes your
calves can be trained that often it's
totally cool it's awesome work every
time
but some muscles might not be you might
not be able to train super frequently
all the time hamstrings are notorious
for taking a lot of damage especially
eccentrically
and they just don't recover their
performance or soreness uh you know for
sometimes
2x a week is the most you may be
training hamstrings maybe three on
occasion
so that's no big deal because you want
your muscles and your actual growth and
recovery
to guide your selection of training not
just dog or from the top down
folks see you next time for excessively
high frequencies peace
