any time i've used it i've gotten
consistently bigger and stronger even
though
the overall training volume is quite a
bit lower
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and as the title of the video says today
i want to share with you one
simple training method to build muscle
faster and when i say
build muscle faster what i mean is build
muscle more efficiently so performing
fewer total sets and fewer total reps
but still getting a comparable muscle
building result and no this is not some
sort of silly gimmick you guys know we
don't do any of that on this channel
this is a legitimate training technique
that works really well if you execute it
properly
before we jump into it as a thank you
for being subscribed to the channel
i wanted to do a free giveaway today for
you guys and this is for a complete real
science athletics product stack
including a month's supply of pureform
microcore and o3 prime
this is the supplement line that i
personally formulated from scratch
using only legit research-backed
ingredients in their full dosages
without any of the typical marketing bs
and corner cutting tactics that you find
so commonly in the supplement industry i
genuinely believe that these are the
best formulated products in their
categories and all you have to do to
enter is like the video and then leave a
comment down below
letting me know the number one question
that you have regarding proper fitness
supplementation
i'll randomly pick a winner on saturday
and i'll post it in the community tab of
the channel
so what is this simple training method
that you can use to build
muscle faster that method is known as
multi-rep
rest pause and what is multi-rep
response very simply it's this
you perform as many reps as you can with
a given weight you rest for 12 to 15
breaths
pick the weight back up and perform as
many reps as you can again rest another
12 to 15 breaths
and then repeat one last time and that's
the end of the set right there and
you'll perform
this sequence once for a given exercise
so instead of doing
uh the standard approach of say three
completely separate sets with full rest
periods in between
you'll just perform this one single
extended set instead
and here's an example of what this might
look like and i'll just use a simple
curling exercise here to demonstrate it
so i'm going to speed up the first five
reps here just to get to the point
so these are the last three reps of the
set i did
eight reps in total for the first
attempt
and here is the final rep as you can see
this one is really tough
there's no way i'm gonna get another rep
beyond that so that is the end
of the first attempt put the weight down
and basically just wander around the gym
and refocus
for a 12 to 15 breath rest before the
next attempt
now here's the second one so i've rested
just long enough to where my strength
hasn't fully recovered
but i can still get in a few more reps
and i think i did
four in total here yeah so half as many
reps as the first one
there's the last rep
and then rest another 12 to 15 breaths
and then here's the last one all three
reps are going to be really tough here
and then by the way this here is what an
all-out rep actually looks like
i'm not trying to sound tough because
this is just a simple bicep curl
which is quite easy to do uh but this is
a true failure rep here most people stop
quite a bit shorter than this and they
think it's failure
when in reality it isn't and that's the
complete uh rest pause sequence right
there
so what's the theory behind this and how
does this build muscle effectively even
though you're essentially just doing
one single extended set for an exercise
well what you have to keep in mind
is that it's only the last few reps of a
given set as you get close to the point
of muscular failure
that actually trigger the muscle
building process and we sometimes
refer to those as effective reps your
body does not make muscle building
adaptations unless it has a good reason
to do so and so all those easier reps
leading up to the point of failure are
not going to have
much if any training effect the only
purpose of those initial reps is to get
you to the point in the set
where you're maximally exerting yourself
on those last probably one to three reps
so the idea with rest pause is that even
though you're performing less total reps
for a given exercise
you're ultimately performing the same
number of effective reps and so you're
able to get the same
or a very similar muscle building
stimulus but in a more efficient manner
since you're eliminating a big chunk of
those junk reps and keeping yourself
up near the point of failure rather than
completely resetting and doing an
entirely new set
each time um it's actually a pretty
similar technique to a drop set
except that instead of reducing the
weight and immediately performing more
reps
you're keeping the weight the same and
then you're incorporating brief rest
periods
and i would say that that way you end up
getting in higher quality reps overall
because you get to have a brief pause to
mentally reset
there's going to be less chance for form
breakdown and you aren't stopping the
set
just because of the burn you're stopping
because you're truly hitting muscular
failure
and without having to reduce the load
either which means that you're going to
get better overall strength gains as
well
now there's no precise rep range that
you have to use here but i would
recommend that you aim for at least
10 reps in total across all three
attempts and what i found personally is
that
if i'm going to true muscular failure
then i typically get
about half as many reps on the second
attempt in comparison to the first
and then on the third attempt i probably
get about one to two reps less
than the second attempt for example it
might go 12 reps six reps four reps
or ten reps five reps three reps or
maybe eight reps
four reps three reps somewhere along
those lines now you don't want to be
doing this on
the very biggest compound lifts that put
your body into a slightly more
compromising position so i wouldn't
advise using this
on squats or deadlifts bent over rows
probably romanian deadlifts as well
those are going to be a bit dangerous
for this technique
but chest presses shoulder presses any
type of vertical pull
chest supported rows pretty much any
type of isolation lift those are all
going to be fine
and this is generally best done for
exercises where it's really easy to get
your body into position
for the lift otherwise you end up
wasting energy on the setup and it can
become more dangerous when you're on
the second or the third attempt just as
one example
a seated overhead dumbbell press where
you have to kick the dumbbells up into
position
that probably wouldn't be ideal and an
overhead barbell press or an overhead
machine press
would be safer just as an example so who
can benefit from this technique
well first off i would say that this is
definitely more geared towards
intermediate advanced lifters if you're
still a novice then i think that you're
going to be best off
to just stick with straight sets and
build up your overall size and strength
base first
before delving into more advanced
techniques like this
doing it on isolation exercises would
probably be fine but for compound lifts
i would say that you should stick to
straight sets
if you're still a beginner or if you're
a beginner but you want to do it on a
compound lift here and there
then i would say just don't go all the
way to failure you can use the same
basic set and rep structure but just
leave a rep or two in the tank
but for those with a bit more lifting
experience this can be a great method if
you just want to try something new
or if you're looking for a very time
efficient way to train maybe you're at a
certain phase in your life
where you have limited time to get to
the gym or you're just highly focused in
some other area
and so you want a way to be able to get
in and out of the gym very quickly
um in addition to that it's also a great
method if you just want
uh to find a way to accumulate more
training volume for a given muscle but
without having to perform a ton of extra
sets
in my case that's actually what i'm
doing currently my train three days per
week
right now on a full body structure but
for certain muscle groups that i want to
emphasize
after i've done my three regular
straight sets i'll throw in a multi-rep
rest pause at the end
just to accumulate some more quality
reps and instead of going all the way to
failure like i described previously
i just do the multi-rep breast pause
technique but i stop about a rep short
of failure on each attempt so it can
just be a very efficient way
to get in more volume for a given muscle
um if i wanted to perform
say three extra sets for my back instead
of doing
three separate sets with uh you know
eight reps each with two to three
minutes of rest in between each one
i could do one rest pause set instead of
say
eight reps four reps three reps so
that's just a little over
half the number of total reps and in a
sequential fashion without those full
rest periods in between
but also in the past i have done entire
training cycles using nothing but rest
pause training and going all the way to
failure with every set
and there are entire schools of training
that are built around this one method
alone the most
popular one is called dog crap training
or dc training it's a bit of a weird
name
but some of you might be familiar with
it and that's actually how i originally
came across this multi-rep rest pause
method and i can definitely vouch for
its effectiveness
now is this more effective than straight
sets i can't really say for sure but
it's definitely very comparable
and any time i've used it i've gotten
consistently bigger and stronger even
though
the overall training volume is quite a
bit lower i generally do recommend
keeping your overall workout structure
fairly basic and straightforward
particularly if you're a novice but rest
pause training is one tool that i've
always kept in the overall toolbox
and that i use here and there for
different purposes when i need it if you
