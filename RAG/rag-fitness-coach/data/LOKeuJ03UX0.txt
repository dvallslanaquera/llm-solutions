[Music]
hey folks dr michael jordan here for
renaissance production
rp plus rpu last lecture
number eight myths misconceptions
myth misconceptions misconceptions
and special circumstances in fat loss
let's keep that in yeah
alright so
two slides here but a lot to say first
one special circumstances
first topic is when fat loss is a bad
idea now it's a funny topic to talk
about in a fat loss
uh lecture but it's very pertinent
because a lot of times people will get
this idea
that if they can't do something else
that they normally do like
they're injured and they can't compete
in their sport they're like oh i'll do
fat loss instead
the problem is injury prevents fat loss
from being optimal because you can't
train to keep on your muscle
fat loss turns into a muscle loss as
well as fat loss
and then you get really really bad
results so that takes care of the first
one
after injury fat loss is a bad idea for
at least two reasons
one you lose a lot of muscle because you
can't train properly
two you interfere with injury healing
because a hypocaloric diet
takes energy and resources away from
potential healing and this has been
demonstrated a whole bunch of times
you want to eat at maintenance when
you're healing
to make sure that you heal as fast as
you can
super important another one times of
incredibly high stress
people will be like okay i'm moving to a
new city i'm starting a new job
and i'm uh you know also starting my own
side company
and i'm dealing with my parents who are
getting a bit older i have to go back
every couple weekends to help them move
into a new condo in florida
i think i'll do a fat loss diet no do
not do that you're setting yourself up
for failure
looking across your calendar find the
less
stressful times at which you're not also
on vacation so you don't want to ruin
any vacations
uh which we'll talk about in a bit and
you essentially want to find those times
and that's when it's good to diet a good
time to diet is actually like january
february and march there's nothing going
on
usually it's a pretty stable thing yeah
it's the new year but you're already
corporate is already
everything's set at work so on and so
forth if you're a student
yeah it's the beginning of a new
semester but it's not the beginning of
school year so it's not a super big
shock
times like that and there's maybe 100
other times you can pick for yourself
that are good
but during high stress times you can
diet not a good idea stress is magnified
your chances of falling off the wagon
are huge
and because your stress literally exact
physiological fatigue on you even if
it's psychological stress
it's going to add up so fast that you're
going to hit your maximum recoverable
volumes and training away sooner
you're going to start accumulating crazy
amounts of fatigue way sooner it's all
really really bad news
in season for sport a lot of folks will
say hey look i'm not at my sport weight
currently like i'm a runner i'm at 165
pounds ideally i run at 155.
i'm going to diet when i start competing
and then the competition i'm training so
hard that all i have to do is reduce my
food and take a little bit and get down
to 155. the problem is
when you're re fueling for competitions
and recovering from competitions in
normal weekly training
you want the optimal fuel not less than
the optimal fuel because you've been
trying to lose fat what does that mean
that means you shouldn't be losing
weight in season you should be losing
fat in season you should be maintaining
and working on being the best athlete
that you could be
what does that also mean that means you
have to lose fat before the season
starts sometimes well before
does that mean you can't have as much of
an off season as you want it totally
that's what it takes to be a really good
athlete
and there's no way around it there is a
way of just doing it during season
that's a good way to set yourself up
maybe not to fail but to have a much
worse season than you could have had
lastly bad idea to try to lose fat
during holidays and trips can you do it
yes
does it usually ruin your holidays and
trips to some extent totally like if
you're dieting through thanksgiving and
christmas
maybe you got a good reason for it you
miss out on a lot of food
a lot of family fun and you miss out on
the sensation of freedom of eating what
you want and relaxing
so remember on a diet it's not just that
you're not eating the foods you want
this is difficult to relax because
you're in a higher sympathetic elevated
state normally
uh if you try to diet through holidays
and trips the
temptation to cheat is really high the
ability to have a normal schedule to
stick to the ability to choose all your
favorite foods the ability to not be
tempted
is all just down the drain and
[Music]
the worst possible setup so what you can
do is you can pull through it and
succeed
sweet but you could have just died at
another time or you're setting yourself
up for
failure but a kind of failure that makes
you feel really bad about yourself
because you're supposed to have been
dieting but you cheated and then it
colors your trip to italy
with these nasty memories and emotions
of temptation
of faltering of cheating
of regret uh of confusion
geez most people who go to italy don't
go for that reason you go there to eat
pasta
and to see really cool stuff uh just do
that
and when you come back from italy a week
later when everything settles down you
got a nice eight-week stretch of no
travel
do a fat loss diet then you can violate
these things and be still successful and
we'll talk about how to adjust
your food to travel in just a sec but
why have to make the adjustment
if you have other times during which you
can be doing this right
you can challenge yourself in 50 other
ways diet doesn't have to be one of them
now if you do have to make adjustments
how do you make adjustments so first to
travel
adjusting to travel can be done in a
couple ways in a fat loss diet
one probably most straightforward way is
sandwich that travel understand that
you're going to not be making
amazing losses eat at maintenance during
travel it's much easier to eat at
maintenance it requires less focus
less you can get way more wiggle room
and you know you sort of like
you're dieting dieting dining you go to
china for a week and you're dieting
dieting dieting you never lost a week
like you didn't go up you have to fight
it again you just maintained
good idea if you're not going to
maintain the interesting strategy here
is actually
to eat a little bit less than you
usually do specifically focus focusing
on protein and greens
why because a lot of times when you
travel and you eat food on the go
extra fat and carbs sneak in there that
chicken you got at the chinese
restaurant
with a chicken on a stick you got in
thailand it's got carbs coating it it's
got a sugar coating
and you could only counter this protein
but that's not really true right you eat
out a bunch the portion sizes are all
funky
anywhere you go uh and what you end up
doing is actually eating a little bit
more food sometimes a lot more food than
you think you're tracking so instead of
trying to hit your numbers exactly
either try to hit maintenance or
undercut so what you end up doing is you
go on the trip you eat mostly protein
and veggies the entire time you eat your
quest bars to bring with you
another good thing is to make sure to
bring protein bars or buy them there
and all of a sudden you kind of earn a
little extra credit
because you were dieting like this and
instead on your trip to china of you
maintaining or gaining
you actually lost a little bit faster
than normal then you come back to your
regular food
you're ahead of schedule and your
regular food seems like more food
because you're under eating during the
trip
but under eating by just a little bit
never protein just carbs and fats
at worst you'll just because of the
calculation errors and the fact that
eating out sneaks in more calories than
you want at worst you'll probably just
still hit your macros and then
no love lost and at best so to speak
you'll actually be a little bit ahead of
schedule so that's an interesting
strategy
strategy to try um sometimes
you get in a situation where you have
sort of low food variety
and uh that can be because maybe you eat
at the dormitory and you're getting
really sick of food so on and so forth
the answer there is to try to enhance
your right as much as possible
but also remember that low food variety
usually means less palatability and that
might be
a good thing like if you have to eat a
turkey sandwich every day for lunch
for 12 weeks on the one hand yeah that
sucks
on the other hand man you know you're
not gonna get
super crazy after that sandwich because
you're just sick and tired of eating it
so there's pluses and minuses they're
not exactly the worst thing in the world
the last one here as far as adjustments
is how to adjust to what we call
macros like you show up and you're at a
conference
and you got like uh chicken breast
smothered in sauce you got pasta but
it's it's gnocchi and it's like
stuffed with cheese or something you
don't know and smothered with a sauce
and there's like croissants for carbs
but you know those are layered with fat
this is basically cookies and everything
sucks
well one is if you know you're traveling
somewhere
like this or you're gonna be in an event
where macros stink maybe a birthday
party or something where there's cake
and pizza
bringing your own food or especially
just your own protein bars is a great
way to do that but if you don't have any
make sure that whatever food you have is
the least tasty option that's there so
you're not sort of driven to eat
a lot of times at corporate lunches
they'll have all the tasty stuff and
then they'll have like a salad area
and you can just take a bunch of salad
and put some chicken breast on it or
something and you're good to go right
you could have eaten all the other nasty
stuff and tried to fit it in your macros
but gee remember the fats are usually
higher the carbs are higher than what
you think
and it's going to make you want more of
the food you're going to end up
overeating
so definitely be really wary on that
stuff
bring your own stuff if you can even if
it's the supplement with a protein bar
but if you do choose to eat the food
choose the least
palatable most filling of the food that
they have and eat a little bit less of
it
than you think you should to meet your
macros so that the adjustment there with
the extra stuff they usually put
sometimes even the salad is oil in it
still gets you coasting in
to a good result versus a terrible
result
right next topic on special
circumstances
what if you're not doing one fat loss
phase or what if you are
thinking about doing one fat loss phase
but you have to do a whole lot of fat
loss
if you're trying to lose 50 pounds or
more really it's
even less than that or more how do you
approach that well here's the deal
a lot of people have been successful
with losing weight
a tiny fraction of them have been
successful with keeping the weight off
one of the reasons for this is they try
to lose too much weight at once get
radically hungry
and essentially lose so much weight that
they set themselves up for rebound kind
of like a roller coaster
so one way to combat this is to make
yourself a rule of never losing
any more than roughly 10 of your body
mass per diet
and taking two thirds to one time as
long as your diet
for maintenance after each one of those
diets does that get you to your goal
much lighter than you would anticipated
yes
what do the maintenance phases do well
first of all
the smaller dieting phases mean you're
likely not to cheat and not to rebound
after
the maintenance phases erase most of the
diet fatigue you've accumulated from
each diet
so as soon as you do one diet you do a
maintenance phase when you start the
next diet
you're really free and clear and
psychologically and physiologically
way more ready to start that diet than
you are to just keep going through
10 15 20 25 of your body mass
10 at most so basically what does this
mean if you're 200 pounds
you go down to 180 you don't go down to
170 at the same time
you stay let's say it takes you three
months to do that you stay another two
months at least
preferably three especially if you know
your rebounder
at 180 pounds or so stay there your
metabolism fires back up your hunger
falls over
you establish a whole whole lot of life
skills eating healthy and eating well at
180
and then after three months six months
total you're ready to go down another
one
10 at 180 is another 18 pounds so it's
less
so maybe you go from 180 to like 165
right easing on the less
side of weight loss of that 10 is
usually better than airing on the more
of like
12 or something get down to 165
that's now nine total months of this
process and then for another three
months
you stay at 165. and then somebody who
just died like 20
off could have gotten to 165 or you know
even less like 160
uh only in three months and then
you look at it like it took you a year
to get to 165 right three months versus
a year holy crap
like this maintenance stuff better have
something to it but here's what it has
to it
because you took your time and you did
it right a year
of you being at this after one year
you're 165
with the last three months having been
maintenance having gone to 165 and you
know
that whole thing with 180 maintain 165
maintain
you're at 165 and you feel great you
have tons of energy you're not crazy
cravings you're a sustainable 165
and you can go down lower to 145 or
sorry
to you know like right around 150 by the
conversion
and probably maintain that not only are
you in a really good place where you
could maintain
but you're in a place where you can
advance even further a person who went
straight to 160
after three months in an idealized world
would be like geez boom success three
months later i'm done and some people
can really pull that off the genetic
elite the lucky ones
most of us can't for most people what
happens is they get to 160 pounds
and people are going congratulations
donna what kind of diet are you doing
blah blah blah you're the center of
retention of the office
and you have your first cheat meal and
it tastes like paradise
that has been formed into food to fit
into your mouth
and you snap and you cheat a couple more
times and
then you sort of you gain a couple
pounds cheating so you start really
ramping your calories to make up for and
you cheat and calorie cheating calories
eating calorie
and after three or four months you're
back up to 180 but you're not a healthy
180
euro 180 that has just failed and failed
and failed and and died at heart and
failed and died at heart and they've
actually shown
that a lot of hormonal alterations for
the better like the recovery process
from dieting do not occur
even if you weigh more and you've
regained some body fat
uh they don't occur nearly as readily if
you have these periodic starvation ear
starvation diets to try to get
under control but you can't get under
control because
that initial 40 pound weight loss is
throwing you so far
out of your homeostasis of your stable
conditions that it's really you're just
freewheeling at that point
what you should have done is cut
yourself off way early right
it's almost the uh so the the battle of
marathon analogy is where does the term
marathon come from
there's a greek history there was the
supposedly the battle of marathon
and the greeks won and uh the runner ran
all the way back who was apparently 26.2
miles to tell the king we won the battle
he ran so fast that apparently he died
as soon as he
gave the good news like you don't want
to marathon yourself
in a fat loss diet and people say like
life
life's not a sprint it's a marathon well
hopefully it's not like the original
marathon right
so you want to make sure that after you
finish a diet you got more than enough
gusto you got more than enough left over
so you can easily recover
coast back at maintenance and then start
back over again
when you're fresh just like someone who
tries
to do a project at work by staying up
all the way through 48
hours uh by the time that their work is
done
first of all their work could suck
because the last 12 hours they were just
typing gobbledygook and second of all
they could crash
get sick and then when the time come
times to give their presentation at the
end of the week they're frazzled the
project sucks they're sick and the
presentation sucks
but if you just work for 12 hours 12
hours 12 hours 12 hours
you might finish the presentation later
but you got good sleep you got good
training
sorry you finished the project later but
your time friday comes to give your
presentation at work
you're sharp your presentation's edited
you're well rested you blow it out of
the water get the big contract
so on and so forth it's it's all these
things have really similar dynamics in
life
because life is all adaptive homeostatic
systems and if you push them too hard
they rebound if you don't push them too
hard if you're patient
and if you give them time to recover you
can stimulate recover stimulate recover
stimulate recover and all of a sudden
you've accomplished your goals in a
sustainable way never having gone too
far
really really really good idea right
and on a very related note lastly for
this section
we have the idea that you've been on a
hypocaloric diet a very very long time
right and you're no longer losing weight
on very low kilocalories right
so you're eating a certain number of
kcals let's say it's 1500 and you
usually lose weight on 2000
you're just not losing weight a lot of
it is because your water storage is
going up because your catabolic hormones
like cortisol or elevated and they tend
to store water
you're still losing weight technically
but you won't see any of that weight
loss until you renorm your calories and
your body relaxes
but even still your metabolism and
especially your active
uh level of thermogenesis how much you
move around can be so degraded
that you're actually losing very little
weight even though you're eating few
calories
what's the recourse there maintenance
starting a period
where you eat more and more food you
maintain that weight you're not losing
any more you let your body recover a
period of two or three months usually
you come back you start cutting calories
again and all of a sudden you're losing
weight
have you lost any ground no is there a
way to rush the process and still get
the results
if you're still asking questions like
that maybe you weren't paying attention
to the other slides
in this presentation and reading a lot
of other rp stuff patience is critical
there's a way to do it right and there's
a way to do it wrong and on that note
last section for the entire course diet
myths
we're going to go through a couple of
these and just real quickly refute them
with a couple of insights almost all
these myths
originate from the human desire
to shortcut things it's not a bad desire
because shortcutting is another way of
saying efficiency
but we have to understand when our
shortcuts are proper
and work and are sustainable versus when
our shortcuts are not
if you look at a map and there's a trail
through the woods and there's a shortcut
that takes you through a nice little
path maybe you have to climb over our
tree stump
that's a really great shortcut you'd be
stupid not to take that shortcut if you
were in a rush
but if your shortcut takes you down a
cliff where you have to jump 20 feet and
through a
ice river it's not a shortcut anymore
it's just a stupid idea
so these myths here come from a good
place in the human
soul that looks for shortcuts but
sometimes they don't go anywhere
here's the first myth and and this is
not an inclusive list unfortunately an
inclusive list would require me to speak
forever because there's more of these uh
there's more fads created every minute
than i can describe
but these are ones you're going to run
into all the time eat fat to burn fat
okay so when people say like when you
eat lots of fats in your diet
your body sort of re-engineers its
physiology a little bit or re-tailors it
to burn more fat more efficiently and
that's actually completely true
um the thing is is that you're eating
more fat so you're burning the fat you
eat
a lot of times people say eat fat to
burn fat what it sounds like they mean
what they think they mean sometimes
because you're drinking more olive oil
eating more avocados your body's burning
more of your body fat
that's not true your body is really good
at burning fats now but it just burns
the avocados and olive oil you're eating
so your chance of losing weight is no
greater fundamentally what is it that
drives weight loss it's a calorie
deficit
right so if you eat exclusively proteins
and carbs and just a little bit of fats
you're going to burn a whole lot of fats
you eat mostly fats a little bit of
proteins and carbs but your calories are
the same you're going to burn
a ton of fats you're going to burn the
fats you're eating and the excess fats
but the excess fat
your body fat is going to be the same
based on that calorie deficit with very
few alterations
so eat fat to burn fat is just a
bullshit slogan to push keto and stuff
like that
another one that you hear a lot people
say you can mistake your thirst for your
hunger
so when they'll say like oh people say
i'm hungry they're like no no
you might be thirsty so drink some water
now if you're dehydrated
fluid can reduce hunger but your body is
incredibly good at detecting hunger
and it doesn't mistake thirst for hunger
the human drive the animal drive
of thirst and hunger are evolutionarily
about as
old as the as the development of nervous
systems
period right like the simplest organisms
that have nervous systems
their nervous systems like detect light
the nervous systems
detect when they have a low amount of
food and get them to go get food and
they detect when they have a low amount
of hydration and go tell them to get
hydration
okay so it's not something you mistake
for anything
it's almost as ridiculous of a statement
as saying you're mistaking sex drive for
something
you're like super horny and someone's
like i think you're just thirsty you're
like oh fucking thirsty what are you
talking about
right that's insane so you're not
mistaken thirst for hunger it's a vapid
nonsense statement you can just plainly
ignore
now if you drink plenty of fluids
especially if you do fluid preloading
that can be cool but it's not the same
thing as mistaking thirst for hunger
cutting carbs as soon as possible myth
of itself
where does this come from here's the
deal bodybuilders usually eat diets for
anabolism
that are high in protein very high in
carbohydrates and relatively low in fats
for reasons that we covered in the
muscle gain section
carbs might have some special anabolic
benefits more than fats
so bodybuilders a lot of times are
already at their minimum fat intake
anyway
and when they start eating uh on a fat
loss diet they have to cut calories from
somewhere so they caught carbs
right not to zero but they caught them
significantly the thing is a lot of
people have a really
good mixed diet and plenty of fats
plenty of proteins plenty of carbs
but they think ah i'm a fat loss person
i'm gonna do a fat loss diet and they
sort of do what the bodybuilders do and
they cut carbs
but they give you eating tons of peanut
butter and tons of avocado and olive oil
and you cut your carbs
you cut a really good satiating energy
source for your workouts in recovery
and you left in a bunch of fats that to
be honest past a certain point just
don't benefit you much
so instead of cutting carbs up front you
should probably cut fats more up front
that's a much better idea how does
cutting carbs up front work
well it's pervaded by the sort of
inherited uh
practice from bodybuilding originally
but it has its own revitalizer
in the sense that anytime you cut fats
from your diet you just lose weight
slowly and over several weeks you can
detect it
fats don't pull water from you when you
cut your carbs your glycogen drops
and glycogen for every roughly gram of
glycogen you store
you store about three grams of water all
of a sudden you lose water weight
quick so when people cut their carbs
like if someone talks them into it and
they do it
they lose five pounds in the first week
and they think wow this
is the way to lose fat but that's not
the way to lose fat it's the way to lose
water weight and think it's fat
is it also losing fat yes but cutting
fats would be better it would retain
more muscle it's more sustainable in the
long run you'll have better workouts
and it burns the same amount of fat in
the long term because cutting carbs is
all hunky-dory
when your first week you lose five
pounds but then at the end of your fat
loss diet when you reintroduce carbs
you regain that five pounds and you're
like ah okay well you regain maybe three
of it and you're like damn it
i thought i lost 160 to 160 but now i'm
163.
but if you don't really ever cut your
carbs and just cut your fats let's say
as soon as you finish your diet you
don't gain any weight at all there's no
rebload because you're already full of
glycogen
right where the bloat is much smaller so
cutting carbs are very tempting
but probably not the right way to go in
most cases certainly not anything
magical about
this is a myth that is very pervasive
it's so pervasive it's not really even
seen as a myth because it doesn't even
have a name
uh it doesn't have a fad diet attached
to it and the myth is in quotes here
it's lose as much
as i can as fast as i can for some
reason
and again we know it's the shortcut idea
which is at its core has a lot of
validity to it for some reason people
who
have been completely out of shape for
years
may decades okay
sometimes get it in the idea that
they're going to reverse decades of
being 250 pounds by cutting to 150
within a period of six months
they're usually ignorant of the fact
that they're setting themselves up for
failure and rebound
your job as somebody who knows stuff is
to talk them out of that
the idea that you should be rushing to
lose fat is
ridiculous because the process of
rushing is there anything wrong with
wanting to be lean faster no
of course it's awesome but
we know that rushing sets up rebounds if
that's just what it does
going too slow can set up a lack of
motivation like if you're trying to lose
like a quarter of a pound a week you
could just somebody could be like you
know what this isn't working
but going too fast definitely is a
recipe for disaster
so when people say like you know when i
was a personal trainer people come in
our personal training gym and say listen
i need to lose 50 pounds by thanksgiving
by the way this was september 1st no
you fucking don't is the real short
answer
first of all you don't need to lose 50
pounds you want to lose 50 pounds and
even if it's for medical reason
it's good that you are going to lose 50
pounds but the medically correct way to
to put it is you should be losing plenty
of weight
the more the better up to a certain
point maybe that's 50 pounds
so instead of losing 50 pounds
quote-unquote losing trying to lose 50
pounds failing
and then getting into thanksgiving in a
rebound the worst time to have a diet
rebound because all the tastiest foods
in the world are with you and everyone
encourages you to eat as much of them as
possible
why don't you lose 15 pounds end the
diet a week before thanksgiving
get your middle of your mojo back have a
great thanksgiving enjoy family and
friends
you won't regain much weight because
your metabolism and eating habits are
already stable
maintain that weight through the winter
holidays
and then january 5th or something like
that start another fat loss diet of
another 15 pounds
you do that a couple more times a year
with maintenance phases spaced out just
like we described
all of a sudden by the end next
thanksgiving by the end by the beginning
the next thing is giving you have lost
50 pounds but again
like per earlier conversation on
maintenance phases you haven't lost 50
pounds and you're just just ripe for
rebound because remember a ton of people
have lost 50
pounds almost all of them have gained
back but if you do it slowly if you do
with maintenance phases if you do it as
part of a learning experience to learn
how to eat healthy and sustainably
you're going to lose the same 50 pounds
it's going to take you way more time
but you're going to keep it off i used
to tell this to students in my
uh class for health and behavior if you
are 65 years old and you're 300 pounds
you're 150 pounds overweight
you're sitting in your doctor's office
and he's like hey listen you're in real
bad shape
like have you ever tried to lose weight
before how impressive is it how much is
it worth
to tell them yeah you know like when i
was 30 33 35
38 so on and so forth every couple years
i lost 150 pounds and then i gained it
back
what effect is that beneficially on your
health when you're still 300 pounds of
65 the answer is a very small effect
that's not good it counts for almost
nothing
so when you're starting out on a diet
remember that if it's not sustainable
loss
it counts for almost nothing
if however at age 30 you took the good
approach
it may have taken you five years not six
months or whatever
to lose 150 pounds but at age 35 you
still weigh 150.
at age 40 you weigh 160
point you know 165. at age 45 you weigh
155
at age 50 you weigh 160 at age 55 you
weigh 145 and so on and so forth you're
right around that area
so by the time you walk into the
doctor's office at age 65 by when
you're really quite in the elder years
and your health is
you weigh 300 pounds you probably won't
be living much longer at 65.
you don't walk into the doctor's office
at 65 years old you walk into a doctor's
office
at 152 pounds he runs your blood work
and he says you're in really good health
man you're
i guess you work out and eat and you're
like yep
so all of a sudden let's go back in time
to another person at your office at your
work at your school or one of your
family members that you were both 300
pounds
when you were age 30 and you both
endeavor to lose 150 pounds that you
optimally should lose to be healthy the
rest of your life
that person let's say did it super fast
and you're setting off to do it slowly
the right way like we've talked about
and you're doubting yourself why because
three months or let's say six months
later he's basically down almost to 150.
people at work are congratulating him
and not you
his wife is happy with him and not you
his children are smiling
he's getting interviewed by the local
paper you know
people asking him what's your diet
what's your trick and
all of a sudden you feel like maybe i'm
doing the wrong thing
right he's like the the the tortoise and
the hair he's like the hair that's
almost past the finish line already and
you're like
good god what am i doing pacing myself
then he's going to go on vacation with
his family he's going to come back at
160.
over the next little while he's going to
stay around 160 then 170
then he's going to have a couple real
bad months stressful months at work he's
going to be back at 180 by the end of
the year
and now you're at 180 at the end of the
year you're tied
he has a history of really bad dieting
practices and psychologically he's a
mess
you're good to go by the end of the
second year
he's ballooned back up to 220 240 and
he's on his way another crash diet to
try to fix all these problems
where are you at you're at 160. so on
and so forth after five years of
grinding
and doing the right thing and of being
patient and of not grinding too hard
you got 150 pounds and you feel like you
could do it forever and you know what
you can
you have all the right sustainable
practices whereas after five years
he's back at 150 again why because he
did another six month mega loss of
another fad diet
and uh he's in this place where he's
just shot himself back up and by
age 38 he'll be back at 300 again and
you'll still be at 150.
really worth considering really worth
giving that some thought right
so when people say i want to lose as
much weight as fast as i can
you can call sort of politely tell them
that they're not among the first billion
people to have that idea
and that idea is wrong sustainability is
the goal
next myth keto is a special fat loss
state people
want to be in ketosis i need to be in
ketosis there's nothing magical about
ketosis that helps you with fat loss
calorie deficit helps with fat loss
ketosis is when not enough carbs are
around your body burns fat
preferentially for fuel
if you have enough carbs around but your
uh
calorie deficit is really high your body
burns carbs and fats for fuel so that
all the carbs you eat
through the day they just refuel the
ones that were burned and you have to
burn that much more fat to supply
yourself with energy
so in the long term you end up burning
just as much fat ta-da
right so trying to get to ketosis unless
you've got some special medical reason
to do it
uh i don't want to say it's a fool's
errand but it's really a distraction
from the main goal of creating a
sustainable calorie deficit
for the short term uh
another myth sort of on the other side
of things people will uh
not be dieting hard enough they won't be
losing weight over several months and
they'll say things like you know maybe
i'm just gaining muscle
like usually you don't gain pounds and
pounds of muscle each week to offset fat
loss
right so if you're not losing weight and
it's been a couple weeks it's probably
time to make an adjustment like we
talked about in
one of the lectures before it's probably
not because you're gaining muscle at
this incredibly rapid pace can you gain
muscle slowly and offset some fat loss
yeah totally
and at that point you don't have to
guess because you'll see it on your body
right you can see when you lose 15
pounds you'll see when you gain 15
pounds of muscle and it usually won't be
something that occurs you know overnight
or over
even three months so a lot of times when
people say like oh i'm not losing a lot
of weight you'll say hey how's your diet
debbie and she'll say you know i'm not
losing a whole lot of weight but i
started weight training maybe it's
because i'm getting so muscular like
yeah debbie you're getting more muscular
but not that much more muscular
so maybe you can uh eat a little bit
less food or change your diet into some
other way maybe expend more energy
and yeah you'll still gain some muscle
but this way you'll also be in a
position where you lose much
fat much faster and you'll be sort of
best of all right
lastly very much tying into the rant i
just gave
on losing much weight as fast as you can
people who want to lose as much weight
as fast as they can a lot of times
succumb to fad
diets and i'm not targeting any fat
diets here i'm targeting fat diets in
principle
the thing about fat dietal shakes and
wraps and don't eat this eat that eat as
much of this as you want but never eat
that
these diets are almost all by definition
not sustainable
that is you finish the diet having lost
all the weight potentially because most
of them are a calorie deficit
but you don't have any tools by which to
live your normal life
because you haven't used any tools
you've used fats for example
if you cut out every single bit of
carbohydrate from your diet
you lose a bunch of weight because it's
difficult to eat that much protein and
fat
what do you do at the end of the three
month period well
you eat carbs again but you don't know
how to eat carbs you don't know the carb
qualities nobody taught you how to eat
veggies whole grains and fruits
you could have been losing weight just
doing that and creating a calorie
deficit then when you bump your calories
back up
you have all these awesome tools you
know how to make meals you know how to
eat healthy you know how to time your
meals you know how to work out all these
great stuff because you followed a
scientific
normal approach to dieting that was not
a fad it just built really good habits
and did a calorie deficit and then you
returned back to maintenance
but if you dieted in a fad diet let's
say you cut out all your carbs what do
you do when your carbs come back in you
start eating potato chips again
bread pasta rice they're so delicious
because you have on your carbs in a
while you eat way too much of them you
gain weight
you rebound back up to your early weight
or close and then what do you do now
you're like oh man i need another fat
diet and you try to do teas or
shakes or wraps so you replace all your
food with shakes for a couple of months
of course you get sick of shakes you
lose the weight though then what
what are you gonna do you're gonna drink
shakes the rest of your life no you
haven't built any sustainable habits
you're gonna go back to the shady diet
you have before
which was the one that made you fat in
the first place and then you're going to
go back to being fat
and then you're going to feel like okay
what's the next thing i heard keto is
good
fasting can i do intermittent fasting
you're going to fast the rest of your
life if the answer to that is yes some
people really like
the approach of it and fasting great go
to it that's not a fad then it's part of
a sustainable lifestyle
but unless the core features of your
diet which are by the way
eating properly uh you know proper
healthy meals with plenty of protein
veggies fruits
so on and so forth unless that is the
core of your diet and you're just
altering calories
you should not be dieting in any other
way right because any other way of
dieting especially the more fatty it is
f a ddy the more like a fat it is
the more the diet takes you away from
normal behaviors normal foods the more
difficult the transition will be for
maintenance
and if and if i you know i've
communicated nothing at all in this
entire
lecture i would just want to communicate
this
fat loss is nothing without the ability
to maintain it
because anyone and everyone and almost
everyone has lots a lot of weight at one
time and they always
almost always gain it back focus on
sustainability
focus on the ability to maintain after
focus on the long view
you're gonna have a ton of success folks
you help are gonna have a ton of success
and eventually we can be a perfect
society of super lean people with
happiness and friends something i would
know nothing about
on that note bid you farewell thanks for
tuning in this whole time
see you next time for another whole
course
