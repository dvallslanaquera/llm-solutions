hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization as
always first video of a three-part
series on preventing
muscle loss during a cut otherwise known
as a fat loss phase
we're going to cover training we are
going to cover nutrition and
we're going to cover cardio all three
play an integral
first of all most importantly powering
fat loss of course
but also making sure that muscle loss is
as small as possible
possibly non-existent so today we'll
talk about
what you can do with your training
essentially the
boxes you have to have checked in order
to make sure you're doing anything
reasonable in your training to set up
the situation as best as possible
to not lose muscle mass during your fat
loss phase
so number one you want to know what your
maintenance volume is
your maintenance volume on a cut is
going to be higher because there's more
catabolism
to balance out some of that volume so
it's going to be more like your minimum
effective volume
on a mass phase or maintenance phase
that's going to be
your maintenance volume on a cut if
you're not familiar with this
nomenclature
or these definitions tons of our other
videos specifically hypertrophy made
simple
and strength training made simple those
series can really really get you caught
up but in any case
basically you need to train enough you
also have to contend with the issue that
as you progress into your cut
the level of total muscle burning
catabolism goes up
so the minimum amount of volume you have
to do for each muscle group
probably trends upwards slightly as your
cut progresses
all right in serious cuts your
maintenance volume can get pretty close
to or as high as your maximum
recoverable volume
which means you're training as hard as
you can possibly sustain
in order to just barely keep your muscle
which of course we all know in hard cuts
gaining muscle usually isn't an option
and that's precisely the reason why
now not only do you have to for the
muscles you train
train at least at maintenance volume
make sure you're familiar with what your
maintenance volume is so on and so forth
but you have to understand that if you
don't train certain muscles
at maintenance volume that is to say
without enough volume
or at all they almost certainly will
decrease in muscle size
through the course of an incrementally
more serious fat loss plan for example
let's say that like you were pretty good
about training your calves on your
recent mass phase on your maintenance
phase now the cutting face comes up
i'm doing cardio my workouts are long as
it is
forget about calves you will lose your
calves
like a set of keys they were here one
day and where the hell are they now now
of course they don't just
decrease in size over a day but over the
course of 12 weeks or something like
that a fat loss dieting
gee whiz you gotta train them at least
somewhat hard
with at least some bit of volume so if
they don't recede off your body
doesn't it suck to build a muscle only
to have it go away
for sure which also means no
specialization routines
on a cut it has to be a general routine
for every muscle
just enough volume to keep it on
sometimes that means more whole body
training sometimes that means a more
advanced split
but you're not going to be trying to
bring up your chest or your lats
because that has to happen at the
expense of not doing as much volume for
other muscles
almost every case in a fat loss phase
you want to train everything and train
at least the amount
that makes sure that your muscle doesn't
fall off of your body
number two for the exercises you choose
in your training
you have to make sure that your stimulus
to fatigue ratios are on point
okay that means you want to choose the
best exercises and the best techniques
in them and the best rep ranges using
those techniques in the exercises
to maximize your stimulus and minimize
your fatigue
normally you could just pick like in a
massing phase
really stimulative exercises like
deadlifts for example that
really fuck you up fatigue-wise but they
also stimulate so much muscle growth
and you know that's the good part
because you grow a ton of muscle in a
mass phase
but the high fatigue they bring along
isn't that big of a deal because when
you're eating a ton and sleeping a ton
and you're not cutting your fatigue
management is much easier fatigue just
doesn't accumulate as much
so you can afford higher fatigue
exercises on a fat loss phase
fatigue is almost everything and you
have to make sure that in your training
you're keeping it as low as possible
while keeping the stimulus as high as
possible so high stimulus to fatigue
ratio exercises techniques and rep
ranges
are everything and to that end higher
rep ranges
often have better stimulus to fatigue
ratios at the end of a cut
for a variety of reasons we'll get into
in another video
so sometimes they are a little bit
better not
wholly better but if a lot of your
training occurs in the 5 to 10 rep range
during normal training
massing or maintaining in a fat loss
plan especially towards the end
you might want to take those exercises
and move them into a 10 to 15 rep range
just real quick preview of why your
endurance tends to go up during cutting
but your leverage has changed to make
you not as strong and also if you use
the higher rep ranges sometimes what can
happen
is you're essentially as you continue
through a cut
the leverage disadvantage makes you a
little bit weaker like your squats are
deeper now
if you're using uh you're not doing high
rep work if you're doing low rep work
it can become psychologically really
debilitating to have to like take weight
off the bar or something like that
on the other hand if you do higher reps
and
instead of increasing a lot of load you
increase reps during that time
you actually get so good at doing reps
because your muscles become slightly
more slow twitch on a cut
that you may actually hit some pretty
decent rep prs so
even if these things are tied on a
muscle retention perspective which they
probably close to are
you have a big psychological boost of
just not sucking
during the end of a cut you can still
hit prs you can still feel good about
your training
and that's just for a month or so before
the cut ends when the mass phase starts
up again
maintenance starts up again you can go
right back into the heavy stuff trust me
anything you lose is temporary neural
you'll get it back super fast
of course in choosing high sfr exercise
we got to be mindful exercises
that for the smallest amount of unit
volume possible
just a few sets give us a really good
mind muscle connection
high tension high burn in the target
muscle
a really good degree of pump and plenty
of disruption
you don't want to use a ton of exercises
during your fat loss phase like i think
this is hitting the biceps but i'm not
sure but i know i'm working hard
and it's really tough tough is kind of a
bad thing in a cut because fatigue
is so impinged you want exercises that
for sure hit what you want like if
you're doing curls
pick the kind of curl they're like oh my
god my biceps and it's not as tough on
your joints
it's not as tough on your systemic
fatigue because again you can't spare a
lot of fatigue on a cut
this means like sort of hinted at
earlier some of your highest raw
stimulus magnesium exercises the ones
that
whatever the fatigue is doing they just
grow the most muscle per unit volume
might have to take a back seat to more
stimulus to fatigue ratio exercises
so for example you may no longer do lots
of deadlifting on a fat loss phase
lots of standing barbell overhead
presses but you might do more machine
presses more stiff-legged deadlifts
so on and so forth point number three
progressing
more slowly is almost always a good idea
what does that mean
first of all as you make training harder
and harder week after week
usually your maximum recovery volume
will come down to you as fatigue
accumulates
in any phase however in a fat loss phase
remember fatigue accumulates way way
fast
so your maximum recoverable volume will
come down quicker which means if you
accumulate
as usual really increasing loads or reps
or even sets what ends up happening is
you run into your mrv much sooner and
then it's a situation where
maybe you do two or three weeks of
normal accumulation training
and it's time for deload because and
we'll get to this in the diet stuff
when you're deloading you should be on
maintenance calories no fewer
gee whiz you know pushing it hard for
two weeks
and then going for a whole week on
maintenance is kind of stupid you want
at least a four to one ratio of four to
one accumulation to deal or paradigm so
you have four whole weeks of deficit
dieting
and then maybe just one week of
maintaining in order to make those four
weeks or more
work here are some recommendations
exercises which you would normally put
let's say 10 pounds on per week
maybe you want to put five pounds on per
week instead
if you're thinking you know this
exercise was pretty easy last week i
think i'll add two reps
maybe just add one repetition and of
course you use auto regulation pump burn
etc
to add sets see how sore you are see how
you recovered but within that context
there's always a little bit of wiggle
room where it's kind of a personal
decision like
yeah i could add like one set or two on
a fat loss phase
err on the side of less so if last week
on a leg press you didn't get super sore
you're covered super fast but you got a
little bit of a twinge
and it was four sets of lead press this
week go to five don't go to six
if it's a massing phase you go to six no
big deal you just eat your way out of
that hole
on a fat loss phase that crazy high
amount of fatigue could spell some
really not great things especially for
sustainability
point number four keep your training
frequency a little bit higher than
maybe normal or just high what does that
mean at least two times per week for
muscle
probably one time per week for muscle is
not a good idea because what happens
normally is this let's say you're
training at maintenance or a surplus you
train your pecs one time a week on
monday
they grow for the next several days and
probably by thursday they're done
growing
and then normally they just kind of sit
around they don't really lose any of
their size
and they recover really really
profoundly they recover from all the
micro trauma their nervous system
recovers that
innervates the pecs and then if you
train them again next monday yeah you
could have trained them more often and
got a little bit more growth
but you're so recovered that every
workout every next monday is amazing
because you
you're like overly healed here's the
problem on a fat loss phase you train
packs on monday by thursday they're done
growing
which is to say they probably put on as
much muscle mass as they lost during
that time
so they're done being the same size
muscle conservation has occurred
friday saturday sunday you're in a
deficit so you're probably not
recovering nearly as much as you should
be
and you're in a deficit without any
stimulus from the muscle itself from
training
that tells the muscle to stick around
there's no anabolic drive
so the net anabolic catabolic ratio
shifts to muscle loss potentially
a little bit of muscle loss but
nonetheless something there so not only
is training once a week on a fat loss
phase no longer get you that super
healing factor
uh it also might lose you a little bit
of muscle just a bit every week but look
12 weeks later that's maybe significant
so a better idea split up your volume
let's say you do
you know 15 sets on or 16 sets total for
chest on a monday and then next monday
you do 16 again
take eight sets eight sets put it monday
thursday
that way you get an anabolic boost and
then by the time
that that sort of goes away you're more
or less training again
and you're always getting this
consistent anti-catabolic anti-muscle
loss messaging that's probably a good
idea for muscles that heal really fast
weird outside adults biceps
some for some people calves maybe three
or four times a week is an even better
idea
because even two might not be optimal
right
again if you go to a higher frequency
situation
don't just add in days and not change
the volume again
when the chest example it was 16 sets
monday
take eight sets off of that put it on
thursday don't go like oh yeah high
frequency 16 monday
16th thursday because that'll exceed
your maximum recovery volume for the
week
you're just going to eat shit in two or
three weeks point number five
really keep tabs on your fatigue and
deload when needed if your performance
on most of your muscle group starts to
backslide
right it hits a peak and then it goes
back down don't be like yeah i'm just
cutting whatever
take a de-load and yes maintenance
calories only on a d-load to allow that
recovery
if you have a fat loss diet a deficit
during a deload what are you doing
because here's the thing the deload
is supposed to save muscle mass spare it
and also you're supposed to reduce
fatigue what is the effect of low
calories on fatigue reduction terrible
what is the effect of low calories on
muscle sparing reverse
so if you diet through a deload
you're really shooting yourself in the
foot and i know
it sucks a whole week or half a week of
deloading it's time you're not losing
fat
for sure but think of it this way you're
priming yourself for another
four weeks of awesome fat loss great
training if you skip the d
load or if you just diet right through
the d load
you're going to make it another two or
three weeks and then you're going to be
in shambles and then you'll have to
deload unless you want a
performance really to start falling and
you're losing a lot of muscle
proper fat loss dieting requires pushing
into the darkness of a deficit and then
coming back out
pushing in and coming back out it's not
pushing all the time
if you want it to be your training and
muscle retention will not be optimized
lastly in between burps of mine
you have to fight to make small prs or
at least
try pure autoregulation which is when
you come into the gym
you don't look at your logbook you go
okay two reps in reserve today
and you hit it and you're like oh i
think that's two and you stop on a
massing phase it might actually work
okay because you're just naturally
getting bigger and stronger anyway
and with minimum willpower you'll just
be like oh two ir oh cool
i hit a pr sweet pure auto regulation is
not the best idea especially on a cut
because psychologically you may be so
tired so exhausted so unmotivated
because you have so few calories
that even if physiologically if you're
able to hit a pr
you might not because you're like oh
it's just a ton of systemic fatigue so
what you have to do
is check this what is it
that i hit last week what numbers what
sets reps and weight
this week i'm going to try to hit at
least the same thing
maybe putting five pounds on everything
and not reducing my reps maybe keeping
all the weight the same but
increasing the rep here and there if you
can push to make those pr's yeah
it might cause you a lot of relative
effort but then you can always deal it
if fatigue gets too high
the other problem is if you sort of ah
like i'm gonna take training a little
easier
it's those reps you miss or never get
it's those ah today was tough i'll just
do sets of eight on the squad i think i
maybe did 10 last week
you take away enough of those building
blocks enough of those stimulators
enough pushing closer to failure over
the course of a diet that can cost you
muscle you have to fight for your muscle
which means start with three reps in
reserve
but push with a purpose until you can't
push anymore
and remember we're pushing not as hard
so we've already accounted for the fact
that it's tougher
maybe we put five pounds in the bar
maybe even two and a half or five if
it's too many maybe we add a rep here
and there maybe we don't add a rep on
all of our sets
of you know let's say we did four sets
maybe we don't add a rep on all of them
maybe we just add a rep
on the first two or maybe just the last
two something at least tie
and try to go above because that way
when you eventually hit failure you
deload and repeat
you know you did everything you can you
really expended yourself
so that you know there may be 99 reasons
to lose muscle on a cut
but you not physically nutting up to
train harder will not be one of them
if you follow this method folks give us
some thought
next time i see you you had better be
lean and not have lost any muscle
see you next time for the next video in
this series
