hey what's up guys sean nalawani of
eliteimpactlabs.com here i was just uh
on my way home from the gym and i was
checking my email and i had a question
here so i figured i would do my muscle
in minutes q a on the way home sitting
in front of the
empress hotel here in victoria as you
can see and the question today is
a very simple one it's kind of a
beginner question but uh
the question is what are macros so if
you watch a lot of my videos
or any bodybuilding and fitness videos
for that matter you'll hear that term
thrown around a lot
hit your macros what are your macros if
it fits your macros etc
macros is uh these cars are really loud
here
it's just an abbreviation for
macronutrients macro meaning large
and nutrient being obviously something
that you consume for nutrition so
strictly speaking when we talk about
macros we're just referring to proteins
uh carbs and fats so if we say uh
hit your macros what are your macros etc
we're just talking about your intake of
protein carbs
and fats for the day so it's really as
simple as that and one thing to keep in
mind of course is that protein contains
four calories per gram
carbohydrates contain four calories per
gram and fats contain
nine calories per gram and if you want
to know my recommended
daily macronutrient intake for muscle
gain or fat loss i will link
somewhere to the side here on the screen
uh um links to some previous videos that
i've done on that topic so
yeah that's really all there is to it
macros is short for macronutrients and
that refers to proteins carbs and fats
again a beginner question but for a lot
of people who are just getting started
out uh they're probably wondering about
that
so uh that is that question answered
