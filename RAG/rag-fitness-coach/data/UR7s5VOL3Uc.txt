oh it's good to be back
bi-weekly webinar with dr james dr mike
how's it going
i'm doing well james how are you
i'm good i'm good my dogs are like being
very needy because it's like snowing all
the time and they're they just they
fucking lose their minds and they just
want to be outside all day and we go out
to get them and they're just like
icicles
and so then they come in the house and
they make little lakes around the house
everywhere they lay down
[Laughter]
it's good it's good
wow
they are
incredibly white
yeah ham definitely is like camouflaged
into the snow you can only like see her
nose and her eyes
talk about a hunting advantage
oh yeah oh yeah but you could tell too
that they have like a heritage for like
uh
for doing work and like pulling sleds
because if there's if there's uh ever a
track in the snow like a game trail or
like a tire track or any kind of like
little path in the snow they immediately
fall into like a single line and start
just going down the track whoa
it's annoying though because like when
you're trying to take them potty there's
like we've driven around the house a
couple times in the snow
there's just tire tracks so they just
get into the track and they start like
marching and i'm like go to the bathroom
go potty and they're like no adventure
so
well our
old english bulldog gwen
is designed for nothing seemingly except
sleeping in late and making pig noises
instead of dog noises
and consuming
consuming and loving she loves with all
her heart she's a little tank
yeah she's also unreal jacked
for no reason at all she has like
triceps and veins and shit and i'm like
what the fuck yeah dude
we didn't get her she was jacked we got
her because she was a baby oh who's the
baby
speaking of babies the donut man has our
first question for today actually a lot
a lot of up votes on this one
a lot of votes this reply is a very
funny question
all right
so the donut man asks
doc
jesus do they know it's two people on
the show
we all know we all know who who
everyone's coming for
yeah
me
agreed
dr james hoffman let's say
hypothetically i'm home on bail for tax
evasion
are you wesley snipes
that's what i was thinking too that's
right
and i'm clearly guilty and will be doing
jail time in the future i enjoy training
but can't afford to have well-developed
glutes considering i'll be going to
prison so first of all it actually is
backwards you want really well-developed
glutes so you can crush people's
cleanses
while they're in your asshole you'll
have to do that a few times until people
just stop trying to have sex before um
but fine you want small glutes i still
enjoy training legs but it's a strategy
to avoid building well-developed boots
i've reduced my calories to about
maintenance and reduced my protein
intake to a very low amount only on leg
days
on push and pull i train and eat
normally for muscle growth will this
result in increased upper body size
without developing my legs
due to
the timing of my nutrient and caloric
intake
by a small margin yes because um
post-workout protein for you know 12
hours after the rest of the day is
important but your muscles grow for
several days unless you do multiple leg
days in a row you're going to get well
fed in those other days and there has
been at least uh have been a few studies
where
if you kind of don't eat enough protein
for a few meals and then you eat more in
the other meals there is a bit of a
compensatory effect
so i don't think this is the best way to
go about doing this what i would say is
if you really enjoy training legs
train them in sets of three to six
repetitions
uh train mostly quads and hamstrings no
direct glute training and you sure
glutes should basically not grow hardly
at all and your legs probably won't grow
they'll just get stronger so just by
doing strength training you can still
train them
and not have them grow
and plus it's fun to train heavy because
you get to impress everyone at the gym
james
unless you're super fast twitch and then
your glutes grow even more damn it
what have i done that would be fucking
hawaiian that would be a really funny
and awesome problem to have yeah so just
to reiterate what mike was saying the
effect of timing in that
on that scale is relatively small and
because you have
muscle growth occurring over several
days like your nutrition on the
subsequent days will largely be
influencing the results of the training
from the previous day so i don't really
think that um that level of precision
and timing is worth the fuss i think at
that point if you don't want your legs
or your glutes to grow just don't train
your glutes directly as mike recommended
you could do strength training or if
you could always just kind of take your
leg training down to maintenance volume
and just do more upper body training if
you want to have a bigger upper body i
i can't tell how much of this is like
jokey or
maybe maybe the person just doesn't want
to have a big butt and is not actually
going to prison i can't tell but uh it's
it's pretty funny either way
yeah
yeah we learned something i mean there's
a lot going on here this one we have
like tax evasion we have like nutrient
timing considerations and uh
glute training that's a that's quite a
sandwich
i'm looking at a recommended video for
me on my youtube here um
it says
mark bell's power project episode 658
meet creates
vitality at any age
featuring sean baker
and stan efforting
cool
i can't think of anything more bro than
being pro meat
fucking meat brother yeah man red meat a
fucking mother yeah
especially on vitality that seems like a
an odd an odd mash-up
right
you know eating meat makes you feel
vital i guess yeah i don't know who
knows i like to put carnivore diet
people and vegans in the same room
and uh
turn on the gas
the worst idea ever
um all right
some of these replies are pretty funny
too sorry that's right no the replies
are very good
um
all right
someone said you're not going to a pound
me in the ass prison you're going a
federal person motherfucker what do you
think a federal prison is that's the
most pound me in the ass prison
fuck
don't take prison advice from keola a
please
um
all right elad f asks hey doc should i
bother with the more expensive protein
powder you're awesome thank you so much
so um
you know
i think there's basically three types of
whey protein
concentrate
isolate and hydrolysate that's right
it's a real word
um
whey concentrate if you a little bit
lactose intolerant because it's not pure
protein
you might find that it makes you do the
squirts
and if you're not remotely uh intolerant
of milk products you probably will feel
great
and the fraction of you know upsides
downsides especially because you know
has a bit more carbs sometimes a bit
more fat if you balance out those macros
for other macros of your day like
concentrates you know grandma got big on
it so did mom it's gonna work really
well
if you can afford isolate which nowadays
is so ubiquitous it's not even expensive
isolate does a lot of good stuff for you
um
it's usually very pure there's very
little fat or carbs and ultra high
quality protein
whey hydraulics that are way hydro
it's like um
kind of how james and i talk about when
people do athlete monitoring with
high-tech equipment they don't know what
to do with the data it's kind of a
solution in search of a problem
um you know whey hydro is theoretically
going to be really awesome by like some
tenth of a fraction of a fraction of a
fraction or a percentage point um one
time my wife and i went on a very nice
vacation together and i and i broke open
the piggy bank and because you know we
went on vacation an all-inclusive resort
but we're not just going to eat all
inclusive food we have to have more
protein servings through the day so i
packed only optimum nutrition platinum
whey hydro
first of all here's what you you put the
platinum into the shaker you put water
in you go
once and it just dissolves and you're
like what the fuck
it's magical but unfortunately the
research suggests
any advantage it gives you is marginal
at best and possibly just non-existent
there's also some interesting idea that
uh whey isolate has some uh protein or
amino acid string fractions that are
maybe actually translocate faster into
your digestive system and potentially
more anabolic and carry their own health
benefits so breaking the weight down
even further than that may actually be
less advantageous so i would say is
you look at what your expensive protein
powder is
if it's got isolate just try to find a
cheaper iceland powder and you're good
to go if it's hydro it's probably not
worth it unless you're made of money and
then enjoy um the other thing about
price of protein powder is i think i
think of two other things that make
protein powder expensive
one is it tastes interesting so like
sometimes uh crystal my wife and i will
get the ghost brand protein powder which
isn't cheap i mean it's very scary
because there's a ghost on it it's very
smoky very spooky but their marshmallow
like cereal milk shit is like cracked
fucking cocaine it tastes so good
then i'm like fuck it i'll spend an
extra whatever five bucks whatever three
pounds
to taste really great so there's that's
one consideration if you like good
tasting protein maybe the expensive is
justified like that and a lot of the
cheap protein powders like i don't want
to talk shit but like james you know
that like walmart brand like six star
nutrition or some shit like that like i
don't even know what fuck you're getting
in that and it does not taste good but
um you know so expense it can be
justified sometimes by taste
the last thing and this is the one to
really avoid it's just marketing hype
like if there's a famous pro bodybuilder
on the protein i probably wouldn't buy
it no i know it sounds fucked up i'm
taking money out of pros pockets but um
you know sometimes it's good protein i
just a lot of times there's a markup for
a really snazzy marketing and really
like top pros and listen you know you're
not getting that protein dip his balls
into that protein you're not getting any
of that shit from it so i would just say
get a basic protein powder that's pretty
decent
um there's lots of great brands the one
that always comes to mind is optimum
nutrition the least flashy market i've
ever seen like hey we have protein we've
had it for decades it's sweet gold
standard opto nutrition is isolate and
it's fucking great and it's not
expensive and it tastes amazing and
there's ten different flavors it's
awesome james what do you you have
consumed protein powder over the ages
tell us about your wisdom god i've had
so many horrible protein experiences you
know what this made me think of like way
hydro is for who is that rp plus member
who lived in the zeppelin and carried a
giant ethernet cord
everywhere
fuck i forget his name there was a
camera
i was an old ongoing joke yeah it's
definitely like the fancy pants uh
protein um
sorry james can i can i expand that joke
for the rest of the folks to check in
sure
so there's a gentleman um the old rplus
group which is now youtube um
fuck i forget what his name was
but um
he had he was uh south american and he
had the most fancy name ever and it
reminded me of like francisco danconia
from atlas shrugged nine rand like a
mega trillionaire basically who was just
like so
from money that he could do insane
things so he made up this whole idea
that he only travels by dirigible that
the derisable is coal powered and made
of uranium to doubly make it difficult
to lift and also pollute the world more
because he's that level of giving a fuck
is just minimal and also he prefers to
have fast internet so the derishable no
matter where it is drags an ethernet
cord behind it to stay physically
plugged into the internet that man as
james is uh intimating would absolutely
have a bathtub of platinum way hydro
awaiting his every post workout it's
going to be it's
going to bother me the rest of this
episode that i can't remember that name
i'm going to be distracted the entire
time i'll have to think about it um yeah
so there's plenty of protein products
out there um
most of them like the difference between
them is so insignificant i would say
first start with like just like your
kind of budgetary restrictions like if
you don't have a lot of money to spend
on supplements which you frankly
shouldn't be spending a ton of money on
supplements anyway outside of personal
preference um you know there's plenty of
like just vitamin shop brand kind of
stuff that's totally fine i like optimum
that's what i use the most
um if you want to upgrade you can get
the gold standard and uh fun fact i
think uh
costco actually has i think that's
yeah i think that's the isolate that
they sell in the big five pound bag and
like two or three times a year it's like
15 bucks off so
yeah so i use and
i think the limit is like five or six
per customer so i usually just grab a
whole bunch of them and that lasts me
you know for the rest of the year so you
get it from people unless guys are like
you guys want to make 20 bucks like sure
like come with me to the store yeah
exactly um and then i think amazon
occasionally will run optimum deals uh
and so you can get it for a really good
price there but outside of that it's
like concentrates fine if you want to
have if you have like gi distress or you
just want like the slightly better
product isolates great and then from
that it's kind of just whatever you want
to do from that point on there's not
really a strong justification for going
up to that next level unless you're
dirigible man and you just want to
flaunt your wealth and pour it all over
the plebes down below yes he pours
platinum way over like the new york
skyline when he's above new york city
enjoy you pathetic scum a very distinct
south american accent now if we want to
talk about beef protein carnivore is the
way to go i mean that's really the kind
of the the elephant in the room here is
that you really should
uh
myself and james and uh dr melissa davis
we were in london one year for the steve
hall revive stronger seminar and um
james bites into this protein bar he got
like in transit and he was like oh my
god oh my god mike you have to taste
this and i was like is it good he's like
it's interesting and i was like god
that's a bad sign and i was like what is
it he's like it's beef protein
and then so it was a chocolate protein
bar and i i tried it i chewed and
swallowed and then it tastes normal
tastes like chocolate and then you have
the aftertaste of blood wash of beefy
bloodiness afterwards the fuck is this
is off vampires with this bar i was like
holy shit it's just a bit much
the experience was like it's like such a
hilarious like taste experience if you
ever see a carnivore like protein
product just buy one for the shit shits
and giggles i sent my friend steve uh
a care package and i sent him like a big
tub of the cardinal no steve doesn't
even lift this is the funniest part he's
been lifting lately so all right okay
all right welcome wanted some protein
powder and i gave him the beef he was
just like what the fuck is this what
have you sent me i can't mix this with
anything i can't make a smoothie with it
i just it's just beef
to quote morpheus from the matrix it's
something you have to experience it
cannot be told about it oh very nice
time get out there buy the carnivore
shit
and sorry in advance
all right
robert burnside asks hi docs just one
question here well thanks robert for
letting us know that we're not more fun
i'm just kidding we have to fuck with
you guys uh is it true that building a
pound of muscle leads to a significant
increase in your basal metabolic rate
according to some studies it's just a
myth personally i've found that it's
easier to stay lean as i've gotten
bigger is the building of muscle itself
that increases bmr or simply the
maintenance that mass you know so so
on the net balance neither you know
calorie burning is only very minimally
related to muscle mass but if you are
like hyper muscular at the same body
weight versus hyper fat at the same body
weight you might see up to a 10 increase
in how much how many calories you burn i
think it's ten percent like if you 4 000
calories and then 4 400 calories you're
not exactly like it's really hard to
tell even you know it's not a huge
difference so don't don't go thinking
like if you weigh 150 pounds you're kind
of skinny fat and you like love to eat
food oh man once i'm 150 lean i'll eat
anything and burn the fuck through it
this doesn't happen unfortunately
however people with a high muscularity
tend statistically to be more active and
when they lift weights and do other
things their muscles produce shitload of
forces and work and burn a crapload more
calories one of the trippy things about
fat people i use that term uh with all
do
congeniality i suppose um
they
can't work out very hard like in the
literal sense of just like tiny skinny
people inside a fat person's body they
just can't burn a lot of calories they
gas out really quick yeah you try
burning a lot of calories if you have
like 400 pounds of fucking just shit
strapped to you like it blows so how do
you burn a lot of calories you got to
get your move on and you know be a
little light on your feet if you're
muscular you can be really light on your
feet while having a crap load of body
mass on you and now you can get a
shitload of work done and burn a ton of
calories so no it's not direct in any
yeah muscle burns more fat sitting
around than fat tissue but it's by a
small margin but it's the activity and
the huge volumes of training you can
handle that really reflect themselves uh
like that james
yeah and just to kind of hit the point
more explicitly like so um rmr bmr is
associated with like increases in lean
body mass but we're talking about like
big changes over time like so if we're
talking about like a pound
that's that's a drop in the bucket
you won't even tell but we're talking
about like somebody who has gained a
substantial amount of lean body mass
over you know years and years and years
yes that might actually lead to a
measurable difference in things like rmr
bmr depending on how you measure them um
so you will see like if you open a
textbook you'll see that those things
are you know associated together but
just keep in mind the scale and timeline
so building muscle is not something that
happens quickly and you need to have a
lot a big change in muscle mass for it
to really have a big effect yeah
and like you said earlier a notable
effect a measurable effect that doesn't
mean it's a big effect it's just notable
like i did it finally i can tell but
it's a small effects on i wouldn't go
gambling on it
yeah and i mean and then staying lean is
still a matter of like the same same
stuff just now you're heavier later on
yes
all right next up is ashton
bukzok
i wouldn't have even known where to how
to attack that one i probably got it
wrong
these um
these not quite russian eastern european
names are often backwards logic who the
fuck knows how you say them
uh
i wonder how they say it butch is like i
would have gone like bajak or something
yeah maybe
fuck dude the thing is like yeah they
need they either need their own alphabet
to say the shit properly or i don't know
how to read the shit on the uh hey
they're rolling alpha better whatever
bacharach
hey
ashton it reminds me of ashton kutcher
no offense to you ashton but damn you
could have had a better fucking name
than that you feel me yeah that's a
pretty solid name
like ashton's the guy hollywood name
it's a hollywood name
ashton is the guy ashton no offense like
if you're like 16 and you're like from a
different school and you're a badass
wrestler there and nobody knows about
you at this new school and like the
first guy to make fun of you at lunch is
like the popular kid and he's like it's
ashton get to know that name
goddammit i can't wait to punch you in
the fucking face yeah beat up all your
friends too what the hell is wrong with
me ashton i take that back you have a
fucking sweet name i'm pathetic please
don't be angry at me james crystal and i
are making our way through um cobra kai
oh yeah the the netflix netflix one
mm-hmm any good
it's a great show um the thing is karate
just doesn't work
you know so
i can't i can't like take it seriously
yeah it's so hard i'm like one kid who's
a blue belt in jiu jitsu would go to
your school and fucking murk all of you
fucks
yeah people are eating one of you with
another person's detached limb by now
god damn it or some like nate nate diaz
in cell fan
from stockton
that's what i need you know anyone
training a person from stockton
california lineage of alcoholism and
drug abuse
too tough to know any better
i have a hard time with like a lot of
the um the reboots because that's like a
thing lately where it's like all these
old things are being rebooted so i'm
just like did you hate this in the 80s
yeah well then you'll hate it
kind of right exactly i'm like yeah
karate kid it was fine but like i don't
want i'm over karate kid and then any of
the martial arts ones i'm just like dude
i just can't i can't
it's just such nonsense
martial arts movies today
about non-mma martial arts by
traditional martial arts
are similar to like watching james bond
like racing cars back in the 60s
where he's like nah shane he's got like
a scarf and you're like
that's not modern motorsport
come on man he hits the button like the
smoke comes out and everyone's like
oh
like what is this even you can tell it
was filmed at 15 miles an hour like this
is just dated
yeah i i struggle with that because i
can't like unsee the mcdojo life type
stuff too where you're just like
oh yeah all right ashton asks what it do
docs what's up paul wall i do
um i'm into cold showers and ice baths
oh fuck this isn't a dating site
uh for benefits other than a recovery
well like i said it's not a dating site
like feeling better afterwards because
of how much they suck okay that makes
sense again that's s m there's a term
for that um
i understand that they decrease muscle
growth but i'd like to understand the
scale of the detriment better that was a
very well constructed sentence to be
able to decide if the trade-off is worth
it i love our followers this guy's smart
as fuck or if i need to find a different
source of pain
you're a destiny passionate really cool
i'm into it too it's great
um to minimize negative effects i don't
take them near my workouts thank you
both
james is the expert i'll let him speak
in just a second really put the kibosh i
think if you don't do it within like
three hours after you've finished
working out i think the effects are just
non-existent as far as hypertrophy shut
down what you don't want to do is like
within the three hours after a workout
before workout would be insane it could
just be really cold and stiff and shitty
in your workout james what do you think
yeah you nailed it from the hypertrophy
perspective there's kind of a time
series thing where if you do it right
after your workout then you're going to
see some of those negative side effects
if you do it kind of like three hours
plus it doesn't seem to have as much of
an effect from a hypertrophy perspective
um if you do decide to do it closer than
that timeline the effect is relatively
small what we like to tell people about
these kind of trade-offs with recovery
strategies especially like the ice
type ones is kind of a death by bee
stings problem where you're not it's not
really shaving off very much of your
gains at all the problem is just the
repetitive use starts to accrue lots of
little shave offs over time so over the
course of you know a year if you do it
every single time is that a huge deal
like are you going to see a huge
difference in the time course of a year
like probably not what about over 10
years like now we actually can say like
well you've been doing it consistently
it's giving you just like a little bit
of a trade-off each time and over the
course of something like 10 years that
might mean the difference between you
being a professional
and not right that's the reality are you
stepping on stage in a competition in
first place or just not placing at all
that's the problem that you can run into
so
we don't want to scare people and say
like don't do it you won't grow any
muscle that's not the that's not it the
truth at all will you potentially grow
slightly less muscle if you do this
consistently after your workouts yes but
it's a very small amount and the effects
are more pronounced when you do it
over time rather than acutely
[Music]
very cool all right you can
still shower when cold or put you know
whatever nine volt battery in your nuts
whenever i get stuck i was thinking
about battery on the nips that's where i
was going to go where it all leads
anyway
next up is
holy shit
oh oh giannis
so i would say it's
rivara
russia is probably wrong but imagine if
james you're american read that
janney's
prizziwera prison where man
hey
that's the local montana name right
there all right
he says deer docks are horizontal
pulling exercises for overall back
development needed if i do deadlifts and
rack pulls which hit the traps if not
what parts of the back are filled out
with vertical poles that can't be
developed
with horizontal
pulls
did he flip-flop there and dead lift
what i think he meant to say what parts
of the back are filled out with
horizontal pulls that can't be developed
with uh deadlifts and rack pulls i think
that's the structure of the question so
um
my take is you'll get 90 of your back
gains
not in the best stimulus to fatigue
ratio possible but you'll still get the
raw gains will be very high from doing
devops and rack pulls plus vertical
pulling um i will say that there are
some concentric and dynamic motions
missing from the mid traps the rhomboids
teres etc
um and i would i would do rows for those
but it might be a thing where you do all
of your deadlifts do all of your act
pulls you do like three sets of rows
every three days and then you do the
rest vertical pulling and you're totally
fine so you don't have to do row after
after row
even two good sets of rose thing may
take care of it uh so it's not much but
yeah there's probably probably want some
dynamic movement uh that's rowing based
horizontal based in addition to rack
pulse deadlifts and vertical pulling
yeah i think that like mike said it can
get you most of the way there but at
some point if you're wanting to build up
your back more
uh
you're gonna run into the problem that
you just can't do as n you can't do
enough deadlifts to actually hit the
areas that you're trying to target more
right and that point you might actually
consider switching to doing a little bit
more uh rowing or more specialized back
movements like i think like up to kind
of like the intermediate late
intermediate level yeah deadlifts will
get you
plenty far but then at some point if you
want to develop that kind of those big
scapular retractors um you're probably
going to have to do more specialized
training that's and that's kind of the
answer to a lot of questions right like
how long can i get away with doing this
well until you need to watch your last
stream like yeah all right yeah for a
while until until someone's okay your
legs need to be bigger and you're like i
agree and you're like but i can't squat
anymore i'm too tired you're like okay
have you tried like press and you're
like ah shit
i knew it was again for that
yeah and like with deadlifts and rack
pulls in particular like the the
systemic effects of fatigue from those
movements are i mean just brutal so and
you might find that
you got a lot of growth from doing those
movements but you get even more growth
when you take them out and can do more
specialized training for other muscle
groups
but that's like a time series thing too
so like again you can get away with it
for a while until you can't
and then you gotta switch
yep
james can i ask you a question about
your youtube recommendations most of
these make sense to me oh boy
so i'm not okay so full disclosure i'm
not like a youtube person like i don't
sit on youtube and scroll through videos
all the time i'm usually like
i'll go on youtube to find something
specific like hey
i need someone to show me the how to do
this thing in excel or i need someone to
show me how to change the light on my
jeep so i might always like a shit show
hodgepodge it's like mostly rp and mma
and then weird shit
full concert classical guitar i have no
idea who this person is because you were
like in the guitar or r in the guitar
i'm wondering if like she was like a
musician on a song or something that i
listened to and then there you go but i
have no idea
yeah
i like the suplex one
yo yeah that's fucking sweet is that
michael chandler suplexing benson
henderson
benson anderson is the fucking man i
loved him as a fighter and then other
people just got better
yeah yeah he was he's kind of was in
that transitional from the old guard to
the new guard group um but he's doing a
lot of grappling stuff lately i've been
seeing him showing up on the grappling
circuit more and more
he's like so athletic oh he's got that
crazy hair
yes all right scroll down a bit james
um yeah all right jake farina we're not
shake the jake daddy has a question that
unfortunately applies to very few people
so we're gonna skip that um
all right jake farina says i just
watched your lecture on damage and
growth and was wondering about how cold
therapy like ice baths cold showers and
icy muscles postponed
two in the same one
my god
i figured we beat it to death uh impacts
growth and damage and what exactly
means for the damage growth
relation
since we've seen that these actions
decrease muscle soreness but also
decrease muscle growth that would mean
that soreness and growth are not just a
correlation but do you think that your
video still holds true it's possible
that whichever effects the cool therapy
has on muscles that reduce soreness just
um also happens to reduce hypertrophy
because if that's not the case then
something like an ice bath would reduce
soreness and turn
and in turn potentially damage which
would theoretically increase growth
since more resources wouldn't need to be
allocated to repair
i was just thinking about it and wanted
to hear your thoughts on the matter
thanks yes it's a good question
um
i would say that what the
workouts or what the cold ice baths and
showers and stuff
are doing is shutting down the
inflammatory process we're reducing it
and the inflammatory process that is
triggered by heart training and to some
extent probably triggered by direct
muscle damage as well
is uh triggering what's called secondary
muscle damage when the immune system
comes into the muscle literally unzips
the muscle cell starts fucking around
with it and that's a big part of the
growth process so training really hard
gets that inflammation going potentially
damage does directly as well
and thus there may be some relation for
damage and growth but it's that
secondary damage that we really want and
that secondary damage is not caused by
the damage training it is caused by the
infiltration of the immune system via
the inflammatory signaling pathways so
if you turn those down you get less
infiltration
less adaptation and thus less muscle
growth so let's say there is a relation
there but it's all mediated or mostly
probably mediated through the
inflammatory effects
the inflammatory effects can occur
um through metabolite alterations they
can probably occur directly through
tension as well and they may occur
through muscle damage maybe to a point
but remember that the muscle damage that
we see
that ones that gives you delayed outside
soreness that's not initial muscle
damage that's secondary damage caused by
that very inflammation and probably to a
large point a large degree a very good
thing so yeah you know we would have to
have more evidence to show that okay
actually just damaging the muscle
without tension without metabolites
structural damage to the muscle can
signal growth they don't have that kind
of data yet nothing very convincing
anyway
that's how we would have to say okay
actually damage itself is causing you so
it's a ruling out problem but that's
that primary damage the idea of primary
damage can cause muscle growth but the
idea that secondary damage causes muscle
growth is quite you're
not irrefutable but it's quite well
supported especially by studies on
things like
anti-inflammatory drugs
cold and heat exposure right after
training which reduce that inflammation
reduce that secondary damage and thus
reduce growth so
now does that
inflammation grow via initiating
secondary damage maybe not but whatever
that inflammation does is critical to
the growth process and if you shut that
down you get neither the secondary
damage or much less of it nor do you get
much of the growth james
yeah i mean so the damage one is kind of
an interesting thing too because you
could also just like hit your body with
like a meat tenderizer
yeah so what what those what what the
like the physical damage often does is
stimulate like protein synthesis from
the standpoint of recovering the damaged
tissue right but not necessarily like a
muscle growth stimulus and sometimes
those things are important to
differentiate so uh recovery and growth
like in the case of damage might be kind
of two different
well certainly two different pathways
but might be serving two different
masters in that case right where you
might actually see increases in protein
synthesis from physical damage to into
the muscle but that's not actually like
growth promoting it's actually just
recovering whatever structural damage
was cause
occurred on the tissue so it is an
interesting topic i think it's
very hard to piece those things out at
the current time but i'm sure maybe in
like 10 or 20 years we'll be able to
figure this out
all right next up is michael horton
who selfishly asks two questions what
at what point would you say lifestyle
impact the load slash active recovery
for example i just took a 12 day no gym
time well i was on a ski trip even
though i was able to give my body a
break from the gym i still imagine i put
a lot of stress on my body notably lower
body during those ski days i would put
myself in the expert category for skiers
as a generally ski very aggressive and
challenging terrain which requires a lot
of exertion on the body other ways to
mitigate this while still enjoying your
hobbies well yeah just do less of your
hobbies and make the most physical so
i'll tell you what
yesterday i went to jiu jitsu and i got
my fucking ass kicked and i couldn't try
all that hard because trying hard would
mean engaging my musculature to a higher
percent of your point runner-up max and
it would
lead to an injury risk and increase my
fatigue level so i basically had to just
do a lot of flow and technique which is
good for my training but terrible for my
ego um and i'll be heading digits in a
few hours
same thing done to me it blows and i
wish it wasn't the case i wish i could
go all out and really use my skills but
i can't do that because it's a fucking
trade-off
same way here is like so for example
let's say you were very serious about
increasing your lower body strength and
size
skiing for a whole week you know knees
and ankles and quads you wouldn't come
back fatigue recovered from your lower
body you would come back fucked up and
you'd probably have to take another demo
so i would say
the mitigation
is enjoying your hobbies first of all
trying to enjoy
hobbies that are not as physical if if
this physical shit in the gym is really
important to you another one is maybe
enjoying some physical hobbies early in
the trip and then later in the trip
enjoy less physical hobbies like having
really lazy sex
possibly with just your hand
um
you know shit like that uh play some
arcade games i don't know what people do
on vacation i've never taken one so um
basically you'd have to just sort of
dial it down at least part of the trip
or
a whole trip
and the other alternative is just to go
ham on your hobbies
and take a deload week after the
vacation
you're going to have to be easy somehow
or some time there's no free lunch there
james any thoughts on that first
question
yeah i mean you basically nailed it but
it's like if the if
if skiing or whatever activity that
you're doing causes like your legs to
not be recovered
can you say that that was a successful
deload week and you're ready to recover
no
it's as simple as that right and that's
okay yeah you can just plan it like mike
said you can either do less of it or
what i would do is if you i mean like a
ski trip is definitely like a involved
thing you probably had to buy flights
and get hotels and all those things and
you want to look forward to it you want
to enjoy it so what i would say is like
plan two weeks for that deload or that
active recovery phase and enjoy a week
of skiing and then have like a little
bit of a down week afterwards before you
get back to hard training and you're
good to go the bummer there is that like
the systemic effect of skiing is not
that hard i've skied and snowboard so
i'm i'm there with you it's very
localized in the legs and the lower body
and your upper body is probably cooled
off and ready to go so you're probably
feeling like i'm i mostly feel good but
just like my knees and my ankles or my
quads or my calves are just really
not ready to go yet and that's okay it's
just a local problem on your lower body
but there's no way around it you still
need that recovery time if you want to
get back to heart training so
i would plan an extra week for just
recovery and enjoy your trip
and then we'll take uh number two for
michael horton um
instead of someone who also got coveted
which resulted in two days of puking by
a weak plus of no appetite that resulted
in weight loss which i imagine a fair
amount would be water what steps do you
recommend to get back to baseline of
both the gym and diet what have you
asked to hammer with food extra to
regain lost weight no no would it be
better to still follow the typical
guidelines of gaining 0.25 to 3 2.5 a
week yes
also for training i imagine it would be
best to have one to two weeks of
relatively easier training to
reacclimate your body to the stress
while you regain strength and muscle uh
michael you answered your own questions
well also right so he said two days of
puking okay followed by a week of no
appetite so let's just round up and say
you had like two weeks of suboptimal you
know diet and i don't even know if you
trained during that time i imagine he
didn't
yeah so i mean i would just treat that
like you would treat like a little
extended time off i wouldn't really fuck
with like trying to calculate weights of
regain or anything like that i would
just go back to doing what you were
doing maybe scale back your training a
little bit just so that you can ease
into your normal routine but in terms of
diet stuff i would just go back to doing
what you're doing and within the next
two weeks you'll be at the same weight
that you were before almost yes
certainly and even if you're not the
same weight let's say you lost some
combination of fat muscle you're going
to regain the muscle really quick and if
you
haven't regained the fat then you're
just be leaner which is
if you were sick and out of commission
for like a month then maybe where maybe
it's a slightly different story but just
like one or two weeks it's like no
you'll you'll bounce back just do what
you were doing and you almost certainly
will bounce back in a very short amount
of time
all right you can't you can't sorry
sorry belabor but it's like you can't
it's such a short amount of time
you can't have lost that much aside from
just like some temporary shifts right
like
two weeks you'd be
you'd have a really hard time selling me
on the fact that anybody would lose a
substantial amount of muscle mass unless
they were just not eating at all and
totally bedridden in the course of two
weeks and if even if they did i mean
they would regain it back very quickly
either way so it's like
don't don't stress
all right
phoenix
i used to have a zenith tv
back in the day
i watched your video on time under
tension there was a specific claim that
i didn't see addressed supposed person
usually does 15 push-ups at roughly two
reps reserved
there's a tnt claim that there is no
difference doing five reps or 15 reps as
long as the set took the same amount of
time with the same weight i assume this
is false but i'm curious what the
nuances are obviously it's much harder
to track five slow reps and rir when you
can always change the time unless you're
using a metronome but assuming you took
the
failure and over time increase the
weight you would you still make gains
just suboptimally sorry for the long
question just wanted to be thorough
thanks for your time small docs well
xena if there's folks asking way long
questions on here she's just fine
so
the general rule is
if your repetition concentric isometric
plus eccentric
takes no longer than about nine seconds
total
the hypertrophy result is roughly the
same between any reps that lasts between
one second in length and nine seconds in
length so you can train pretty fuck and
slow
and so for example let's say it's 15
push-ups right
and you slow it down a lot so that it's
five
that is a lot of tension being put into
the muscles and will probably result in
this roughly the same hypertrophy so
that is absolutely a true claim of time
under tension
the real question comes back to
why in god's name would you do that
who the fuck wants to train with a
fucking metronome oh my you beat me to
it damn it i was gonna be like get that
fucking all right
james please finish up no i'm so that's
the one i was just like if i come into
the gym and i see you with that goddamn
metronome i'm going to stop
slapping get that goddamn metronome out
of here what the fuck are you doing are
we sick are we playing music or are we
lifting let's get to training what are
you doing
um yeah i mean at this point too it's
like
this is kind of like more of a like
theoretical issue
i would say like i
i'm trying to say this in a nice way but
it's like don't put this much thought
into the cadence where you're thinking
about like doing something that you
could have done for 15 reps under you
know kind of normal conditions and then
making it so ridiculous that you're
going down to five reps it's just to me
that's like again why is that fucking
metronome in here what are you doing
get
get busy get to work you can if you can
do regular push-ups and that's fine i
understand the like the question um just
from like a theoretical perspective but
then it gets into like a practical like
kind of like what the fuck are you doing
sorry i'm not trying to be mean but it's
like
well yeah what are you doing what are
you doing get in there and do those
push-ups you don't have to think about
it that much
[Laughter]
all right
and uh
yeah so so see the answer question
actually is a valid way to train it's
just real world a little bit complicated
so if you're like injured you can't move
weight quickly yeah you can slow it down
and benefit
all right what if you get a cramp
now
[Laughter]
andrew
atkinson our long time uploaded
og
says hi docs do we have to do cardio to
be healthy cardio is an actual running
cycling or whatever activity to get the
heart rate into the cardio zone
currently my only training is lifting
and i also get at least 10k steps per
day sometimes more i used to play
football soccer a couple of times a week
but since covet hit basically haven't
done this my question is i've been
missing out on some health benefits of
cardio even if i can get the results i
want without it thank you doc so i would
say there's a marginal very small health
benefit of doing pretty hard cardio
two to four times per week for 15 to 30
minutes or more at a time but that that
if you do higher up lifting a lot of it
and if you have high number of steps per
day you're getting like 90 or 95 percent
of that health
benefits if your optimal health yes i
would include some hard cardio but it's
a very small fraction so you're very
very healthy the way you are now
yeah absolutely um you don't have to do
cardio to be healthy there's definitely
advantages of doing i mean if there's
one thing that's been beaten to death in
exercise science literature it's like
the various health promoting effects of
cardiovascular exercise my god there's
innumerable amounts um but i think
really the way you could rephrase this
is like do you need to move
to be healthy the answer is yes what's
more important is moving around and not
just being like a lazy fat slob um so i
think
what they've actually shown pretty
clearly if you look at
the kind of uh
the dose response curve in terms of
doing more cardio and like the resulting
health benefits you get most of it
occurs we're saying like 80 percent of
the benefits occur from being like
completely um inactive
to being a regular exerciser right and
that might just be like doing you know
cardio two to
three or four times per week depending
on which studies that you're looking at
but it basically is like going from
someone who is completely stagnant and
doesn't move around to just doing
regular cardiovascular exercise a couple
times per week you're getting a
humongous chunk of the potential health
benefits right there now there's another
like 20 or so of additional benefits
that you could pursue but at that point
you have to actually start doing harder
cardio whether that's you know
in more endurancy or more interval or
more high intensity interval that's kind
of up to you but you absolutely don't
have to do it there are some unique
benefits of doing steady-state cardio
and of doing high-intensity cardio uh
respectively but
you don't have to i think maintaining a
healthy body weight and just moving
around is probably the bigger issue at
hand
you just can't be jabba right that's
really what you get like jabba can't
marry you he just can't move around that
well
all right
next up
last opportunity
he said hey docs
i've basically started doing the rp
style of long-term fat loss
dieting maintenance breaks
uh that are 60 percent 150 of the fat
loss phase and duration now my question
is the following would it be smart to
eat in a small surplus during the
maintenance phase
the idea is that for the cost of two or
three pounds of fat regain you could get
one or two really hypertrophic mesos in
and possibly reduce diet fatigue faster
so first of all yes you would gain a lot
more muscle doing this and you
absolutely would reduce more diet
fatigue the reason we usually program it
for
uh sorry usually we don't recommend it
for people that want long-term
high degree of fat loss is twofold one
most of those people are not exactly
interested in being gigantic muscle
people so they
wouldn't
slow surplus for them would be like
something you had to tell them why they
were doing it and they would still be
like really okay
all right fine but can i just like not
gain weight and that kind of leads into
the second part
psychologically people who have been
very fat and need a multi-phase approach
often really uninterested
in gaining weight
uh in in in their
maintenance phase and even more
concerningly because you can oh if
you're a good coach you can talk people
into doing all kinds of stuff like that
um the bigger concern is sometimes when
people start to gain weight
uh they have this idea of like you know
what
fuck it
i'm going back up and they careen up and
out of control that's not always the
case
that means maintenance is just a lot
easier to sell to a lot of people and it
does check all the boxes they're
interested in
but if you happen to be in the
camp of you just want to
get some disease pretty decent muscle by
the time you get down on body fat but i
think there's slow gains
between diets is a great great great
great thing i think it's totally totally
possible it's got all kinds of benefits
that you've got to pull it off properly
actually gained very little weight which
is very difficult for many people to
pull off
james
yeah so i agree with mike in terms of
like it's it's definitely feasible and
and potentially useful but um just from
a practical standpoint i find it better
in my coaching experience
to kind of keep your eyes on the prize
of whatever the kind of the grandiose
goal is right so if you're trying to
lose weight i think sometimes
teasing the idea of like do you want to
eat a little bit more now and maybe gain
some muscle it's it's it's a bit of a
distraction for most people where really
what i would want to funnel people who's
doing like a long-term weight loss is
like
let's get you to lose the weight
effectively and then let's recuperate
and give you some time off so take your
mind off of it take the physical
stressors off of it and get your mind
right again so that we can go back and
continue if we need to do that i feel
like kind of this idea of like you can
kind of do these little in between it's
not quite a true muscle gain phase but
it's not really a true maintenance phase
either to me it's one of those it's a
distraction in that there's not like a
clearly outlined goal and then people
are going to see their weight creeping
up mike's like mike said most people who
are doing long-term weight loss i mean
you can tell people
until you're blue in the face that
switching from cut to maintenance
there's some normal rebound weight gain
that's going to occur most of it's just
water because you're depleted and you're
filling back up again they still panic
every fucking time why have i gained
five pounds because you were depleted
before now you're filling back up again
it doesn't matter and then you add a few
more pounds on top of that that's
clearly going to be tissue weight
it's it's a tough sell for a lot of
people in practical terms so whereas if
you say like hey we're really focused on
getting this weight down to a point that
you're you feel good about where you're
at and then
then the gain train is coming and it
gives them something to look forward to
where it's like i've been doing this
fucking weight loss for so long i'm so
sick of this and now i get the prize
we're gonna do fucking a nice long block
of hypertrophy training
gain some muscle and i think that's an
easier practical cell because allows
that person to get into the long-term
mindset of like this is what i'm doing
for a while
it's kind of like when um
i don't want to say it's the same but
it's kind of like having cheat meals
where it's like yeah you can have cheat
meals when you're on a diet but really
all that does is makes you want more
cheat meals
instead of just being focused on what
you're doing which i think would be like
my practical input on that would be like
it's definitely doable and if you're
somebody who can detach some of those
emotional
uh roller coaster along with the weight
that that's great i think for most
people
get her done and then move on to muscle
gain if you want to do that later but
trying to split the difference can be
difficult
[Music]
it can also be a little bit demoralizing
to people who really want to prioritize
their weight loss
you know they less let's say from 200 to
185
then their mass takes them to like
uh bloated 193 which means a 189 when
they restart the diet
gee seeing that 193 five months after
you started the journey you're like i've
only lost seven fucking pounds this is
bullshit
and it can be pretty disheartening
whereas the same person
who chose to just continue to maintain
after five months
would still be 185 184 and then they'd
be like wow this is great and i'm having
an easy time keeping it off and then
when they restart their next fat loss
diet they don't have to start from 190
they start from 185 those head starts
five pounds here five pounds there they
add up you reach a long term goal faster
so the really the question is how good
are you
how panicked are you to want to lose the
weight asap
and how much interest you have in
becoming pretty muscular at the end of
the process
or through that process
um
i'll tell you like a lot of people they
just want to lose the weight
and for them i think maintenance is
probably the right answer and for you
the
you know the sort of slow masses between
are good i've done that before it worked
very well for me
but it sure took a long time to lose the
weight thing is i wasn't interested in
weight loss just that also didn't bother
me a bit
but if you're really interested in
long-term weight loss to a significant
extent
yeah you might want to err on the side
of just 18.
and then there's also something to be
said too of like if you're trying if
you're doing the slow the slow gains
thing and it's maybe only for a meso or
two it's like
are you even gaining that much muscle is
it even worth it and so one of the
problems you'll run into is somebody
like you said you get them up to a
bloated 193 using that same example and
it's like they kind of look at
themselves and they're like was it worth
it did i gain that much muscle
i don't really know
because you're still heavy right at that
point um there's still more weight to go
so it's again like i definitely think
somebody like mike can pull that off uh
i think a lot of people would have a
hard time and then you'd be like no you
definitely gained muscle and they're
looking at themselves in the mirror and
they're like
did i now i'm just fat again
so
i think that might be one of those where
you have to you make that decision on an
individual basis with the people that
you're working with
dave that's all we got man
all right that was good had some good
questions a lot of uh the ice ice stuff
came back made a resurgence
and i watched uh chris lana watching a
documentary about
manchester city soccer team
which has a few athletes on it making
like over 20 million dollars a year yeah
dude professional soccer is crazy
and uh
they had this whole cryo chamber
i really hope they're not doing this
right after training
[Laughter]
yeah i mean so like food for thought
folks like we we spent enough time
bashing the the kind of cryo-eye stuff
but like soccer is a great example of
when it might be useful let's say you
have three matches maybe not the
professionals but like in the semi-pros
or college level you might actually have
several matches in a week and you have
to perform well in subsequent matches
after the first one right
that's actually a really good
application of that it will help you
recover a little bit faster so that your
performance will be stable across
multiple stressful matches but doing it
like during your off season when you're
trying to gain strength and muscle or
explosiveness um probably not a good
idea
dr mike uh any any housekeeping rp or
full rom or dr mike or youtube related
what do you got yeah if you guys want
programs and all the amas you can stand
join us on team full rom just go to
instagram or click the link in the
description below this um and then pay
us money and you'll be in teamful run no
problem you get cool shirts but other
than that no lots of plenty exciting
stuff coming up but nothing you can
speak about quite
um i have like a big deadline for an rp
project coming up at the end of the
month here and i don't know if i can
talk about it yet but i think it's going
to be
pretty cool later
yeah so hopefully i'll be able to speak
on it more and more i'll ask us mike and
papa nick off screen about how we want
to deal with those kind of announcements
but for now it's a secret so mind your
own fucking business just kidding
that's all i got i got i got big things
in the work they're coming up but i i
gotta zip it for now
all right
all right folks thanks for tuning in we
appreciate your questions we appreciate
all the upvoting and you guys playing
into our little uh q a system here
thanks again for your participation and
we'll see you next time
