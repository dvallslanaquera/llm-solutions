what's the optimal grip for Barbara
colors it doesn't exist because human
genetic variation in anthropometry is
really high find a grip that works well
for you experiment here's what you're
looking for do my shoulders feel weird
and so weird and so often perhaps so
painful that they get in the way of my
being able to do the movement properly
with full effort unrestricted if that's
the case find a different grip elbows
same thing if my elbows feel weird if my
elbows hurt
find something else wrists sometimes
your wrists will feel weird in some grip
or another so you've got to play around
with all of those
