there's a lot of new stuff coming out on
sleep uh extension so the opposite like
i am excited to go to this gym though
man i can't wait
elite fts right it's like this spot it
is the spot
it's um it's just dave's private gym um
so it's not like a community gym but
you'll see you're gonna be very
impressed
i'm stoked i love new equipment like
even the prime equipment from yesterday
was
a treat for me it's gonna be fun man i
think i'm starting to get a little
spoiled from all my treasures
if i go to a gym and doesn't have a
bunch of fancy stuff i'm getting a
little snooty
in my old age like come on man
where's the hip press made by rogers
what kind of gym is this that's how i
want to be so this is just
kind of a simple breakfast we got two
eggs turkey sausage
whole wheat toast and some potato wedges
john's got the real teal well normally
normally my breakfast
is just two eggs and two pieces of toast
and that's what i normally eat but we've
got
an hour drive to uh our gym
so and then we'll probably talk and
visit a little bit so i got a little bit
more food so i don't get hungry so i got
my two eggs and two
two pieces of toast plus some turkey
sausage some fruit
and i couldn't pass up the carrot cake
pancake that's going to come in handy
toward the end of the workout you'll see
we'll have to call upon the pancakes
all right so we're pulling in f uh lead
fts but
we got to make a quick stop here at the
london baptist church
so we're headed into church are we
giving thanks or asking forgiveness um
i'm praying that jeff doesn't kill me
with this full body workout
forgive me father for curling in the
squat rack
your leader chest is literally out here
in a field is this really it though yeah
oh geez
it's awesome like this like dude we're
like out in a field right now
so do people just like work in here like
distribution type
yeah okay they have there's warehouses
too where they i got you
send out all their stuff and i got you
so there won't will there be other
people training in here like is it a
public
no it's not a public home there probably
isn't anybody training honestly
this is so cool i'm gonna we should give
them just like a quick little run
through like
not a full tour but just try to show
them the enormity of it like how much
equipment is in here
man there's a lot of different types of
machines here is this like a pendlay row
that is a prototype uh leg curl that
they're working on but
somebody is jimmy rigging it right here
i guess and they're doing some rows this
is an inverted leg
uh leg curl oh wow so you actually put
this in your chest and you lower
yourself with it and here's the
counterbalance oh cool
it's pretty wicked for hamstrings all
right well um i say we just get started
we can kind of show people around as we
go
how about that sounds good i'm running
the show today hey yes you are okay
if something's gonna hurt me i'll tell
you there's about like a hundred
different types of barbells here i don't
know if you can get perspective for it
on camera but there's like
fat bars skinny bars cambered bars
that's crazy all the different swiss
bars different angles for grip
so we're going to do full body today um
start with legs
so we have a leg focus so we'll do
one multi-joint squat type movement and
then one hamstring
movement and then we'll move on to we'll
do one exercise for chest
one for shoulders one for back even
though we hit back yesterday so we'll
keep it
kind of an easier exercise okay and then
maybe abs
calves gotcha all right so one of each
so i'm just gonna do like
bodyweight walking lunges the whole
length of this little track here
twice down and back
i'm just gonna do about like five
minutes of dynamic stretching and foam
rolling
just get the joints nice and loosened up
because it is a little bit colder in
here
uh a couple sets of six on this
so decently heavy what would you call
this this is a spider bar
it's a combination of a safety swab bar
and a camber
this camber makes it really challenging
if your form isn't impeccable
this can swing and this bar itself
weighs 75 80 pounds
right crazy heavy yeah it is i curled it
up to get it up in the squat rack and
i was like oh this is a matter of normal
bar yeah it's a 1rm curl
this apparatus here makes the weight
shifted slightly more
forward so it forces you to keep more of
an upright back posture
so i find it a little bit more
comfortable in my lower back
and it's going to be probably slightly
more quad dominant yeah
for sure i'm focusing more on volume
accumulation here
and getting to something around like i'm
gonna say like an rpe seven or so
okay um our p78 gotcha so that should
still feel
pretty heavy right um so and those will
be our working set so we'll do
we'll work up to two in that in that
zone
two or three depending on how they go
real tight
nice
nice
nice
come on here we go
tight beautiful yeah not too bad
good job man how did that look to you
awesome good yes awesome you get
def with that spine straight up you're
crushing your quads
so i would call that like rpe six
okay so i'm gonna do two more with a
little bit more
how long usually rest between your sets
um three to five
minutes probably be closer to three
today i'd like to do about 25 minutes
there we go up two steps back one two
right there tight
drive there we go come on
dry good
come on dry gotcha
come on here we go
two more good two more let's go
up good last one
up good job good job
for this one as long as you're
comfortable with it yeah i want you to
go
to an rpe eight so leave two in the tank
two so you might need to go i don't know
you're around the six to eight rep
range but what the most important thing
is your proximity to failure so
you get to six wraps but yeah but leave
two in the tank
yeah yeah so you tell me you actually
want me to do real work
exactly i was just going to leave 10 in
the tank man
dang he foiled my plan
oh yeah easy wait let's go
come on you got way more let's go come
on
keep it going keep it going
come on
keep it going keep it going
oh yeah that was good that's good
that's probably good that's scared
as beavers and butthead will say fire
that's good that you get it though
getting getting that threshold
of intensity in is more important than
just
stopping a city that's right here we go
back to work okay
back to work
yes yep oh yeah
here we go come on
come on here we go up
good come on up
good come on up
come on come on good
two more up
i got two more okay let's go
up one come on
up yeah walking in
that's a nine that was a nine right it
was about eight or nine yeah and a half
nine right yeah yeah
oh yeah where i pause in between reps to
breathe every time
yeah i get a little more like i have to
push it
it might look harder because you get
a little bit of recovery in those one or
two seconds right
so you know if i was to just go if i was
to just
go constant tension yeah that grindy
wrap i might not be able to get another
one
yeah but if you take one two now you can
get another there's more reps
yeah so that's the way i think of it
it's more load you're doing more reps
with the load
so that's it for these now okay so i
survived
no injuries sometimes i'll move straight
into the next leg movement so
we're going to hit hamstrings but since
these were pretty fatiguing i think
we're going to move on
to a chest movement now allow our legs
to recover a little bit and then we'll
get more out of the hamstring work when
we actually get to that
something i'll do to kind of manage my
fatigue in the workout is i'll space out
any leg work that i have with say a
chest exercise or a back exercise or
something like that
a lot of people have in their heads that
they've got to hit all their leg work
first or they got to hit
all their back work first but it doesn't
really matter as long as you get that
volume in throughout the workout and if
you can space it out
better in a way that allows you to be
more covered and push more weight that's
just going to improve your performance
and the effectiveness of the workout
overall so it might seem unconventional
to move from a squat to
a chest press and then go back to the
leg curls but if you think about it your
hamstrings will probably be more
recovered if you can space it out that
way
there are these little wedges that
change the angle
of the grip you see this these little
wedges in here i'm actually always
bitching about the grips or the
handles on these machines because they
break their wrist breakers yeah yeah
yeah
okay that's much doesn't that feel
better it's much different
it's just i don't know if you can adjust
them can you move it out a bit
oh okay okay yeah they just like pop off
they're just like back grips okay
throw them on anything yeah
oh god this is fun you're good
is gonna hurt okay this is a tension
that i think you're really gonna like
i'm excited
like i said i don't do a ton of band
stuff right but this is fantastic
the contraction you get on this is
awesome just press and squeeze and see
if the flex is really hard
oh buddy is that flex nasty yeah
right there right there you should get a
crazy contraction
okay that's good for a warm up i'm gonna
want some weight on there
that's better big flex
that's it there we go
squeeze squeeze
okay that's good good oh so that was
13 rp8
tell me man i don't mess around you're
strong dude you're strong like this
this is hard with these bands yeah
[Music]
i was burning down my calves
i'm going to add a bit of weight i think
yeah less out of 10.
one of the things a lot of people do and
or think when they think full body
is a very minimal program so they think
squats
barbell bench press a row maybe some
crunches whatever and then that's it
right
that's fine if you're training say two
or three
times a week full body but when you do
high frequency full body
imagine doing all those heavy compounds
then every day yeah
joints yeah you're gonna smoke yourself
right so i'd like to prioritize
one heavy compound we just did that on
the squats yeah and then the rest of it
we can do
isolation tight movements so this is
going to be easier in my opinion on our
joints than if we did a loaded up
barbell bench press yeah we had to load
it up freestanding barbell row
i mean just imagine you put all that on
one day then the next day you got to hit
those muscles again
yeah so for our chest we're going to do
something that we're squeezing
and feeling and protect our joints and
then on one of the other full body days
we can do the
the bench press you know okay big flex
big flex there you go
big flex boom
good keep working two more two more come
on keep working
good one more let's go
up up up up
i call an exercise like this an
isolation type exercise because
obviously it is a compound exercise
you're going to hit your triceps
and your adults as well but i think of
it more like an isolation exercise
because you can really focus on just
squeezing the pecs
whereas on a bench press you can't get
that same type of my muscle connection
with one muscle
we're gonna do this actually i'm not
sure what do we call this inverse curl
so this is gonna provide some assistance
on your way down so it's gonna be like a
glue hand raise
with a bit of assistance here this is
very cool
whoa now you can contract it's too much
assistance
it's like it's almost i almost got a
fight to bring it down big romney must
have been using this before me so hang
on
now see if that's about right see if
that's about right
this will be good for a warm-up set but
i'm going to take another plate off when
i work
okay
this is the most amazing glute ham race
i've ever done yeah this is a working
set for me
yeah how hard it will go
let's do 10.
same thing couple couple reps in reserve
so don't go all the way
down or we can i can add a bit more here
so i like this
this movement as opposed to just a
normal leg curl
because your hamstrings have to work to
keep the hips extended
yeah and flex the knee at the same time
so you're performing two joint actions
in the one movement which on a full body
setup is nice
it's like you could do an rdl and a leg
curl that's right or you could
kind of knock them both out yeah that's
a good point they're different obviously
different loading patterns and stuff but
i mean it's it's a very efficient
exercise
john was just saying to me you could set
this up on a lat pull-down machine where
you put your ankles
in the knee pads and then use some kind
of rod
yeah like a broomstick yeah but it's not
going to be as smooth as this
unfortunately good
okay two more okay here we go finish
strong
good finish come on finish strong
work through it flex your hands flex
them flex them
flex them there we go that was nine so
now i'd i'd normally
move on to a back movement we just hit
back yesterday but i still think we can
do like a pullover
exactly what happens yeah yeah so watch
these are
awesome to do pull-ups really yeah
kettlebell
watch watch my hand position look how it
opened up my laptop oh yeah yeah yeah
good job oh man oh
i'm finding the kettlebell allows me a
little bit extra range of motion without
stretching my shoulder
just from that heat no hand position yep
perfect
oh yeah perfect opens this all up oh
yeah
okay grab that okay
a little different right yeah i really
like it the stretch almost feels
therapeutic after yesterday it doesn't
so with these
especially when you're doing them with a
dumbbell or a kettlebell instead of a
cable
you're really getting peak tension here
at the bottom
and then if you come all the way up here
almost nothing unless you're like
actively squeezing your chest
so i like to keep it more in the stretch
part of the range so
i'll come maybe about three quarters of
the way up and then go
really nice and back come on come on
all right last one let's push it a
little more on this one once you think
you're at failure
just kind of rep it out in that partial
range
yeah okay
come on stretch squeeze the lats
stretch squeeze good ah
[Music]
that pump from yesterday came back yeah
we brought it back to life man
for this last one we're going to push it
rpe 10
so once you can't do another rep with
good form that's 11 minutes you'd
normally stop yeah and then
after we reach our p10 just gonna do a
few pulse reps
in the mid-range here we go
nice nice
come on i got one more okay come on
come on
fight to the burn that's good that's
where it got me four and a half
oh buddy four and a half is what got me
two feel the triceps on those
a little bit but i did it too once you
reach failure
uh other muscles just start to try
something yeah here i go your chest
starts flickering a little bit
we're going to do some isolation work
for the shoulders so we would have
gotten a bit of front delts over on the
chest press over there but we really
want to hit that lateral head so
just going to do plain hat lateral
raises here watch my bicep
that's crazy when the light hits it
right here
one of the things i do like doing is
going real heavy and just working the
bottom oh really
and then sometimes and then i'll lighten
it up and i'll just work this let's do
that
that's i've never tried nasty let's do
that so what would you normally use on
the side lateral
probably a 20 pound dumbbell so i'm
doing good for him so use the 35
i'm going to do 40 because i feel like
35 let's go
40 now this is more of a swing
so don't think about i got to get the
weight up
just stand here tilt your head back and
just swing like this
but so now you got a heavy weight where
you're strong
and we got to do high reps so let's do
15.
just swing four five
we'll do 15 and six five more one
two three four
five now you could do your sets like
that or
now you could do another six days full
range of motion yeah
oh yeah yeah dude your form is perfect
that's perfect
yep ah yeah that's nice
i like that it's not that's different
it's very different and
it your shoulder still has to fire even
if you're swinging it yep
it still has to work yeah and it's
getting a lot of weight in a position
that's not used to having a lot of
weight in
one thing that i like to think about and
you talk about keep getting your traps
out of it
i find usually this isn't something i
think about too much because i want my
in my tricera but women especially i
find don't want that so
um one cue that i use is think about
it's almost like you're
like okay so you're digging your hand
down into the ground and you're trying
to scoop some dirt up yeah so you're
you're sweeping it out rather than like
obviously rather than shrugging but
sometimes people can't think about it
that way so
think about it with your hand and it's
like i'm pushing out against you
you know what that's a great like i tell
people to flex their delt when they do
it that's actually a great way to think
about it sweep it out that's how you
flex
yeah because that's what i'm doing i'm
i'm flexing
and then when you got the heavy weight
that might i'd have to experiment with
it but it
might be a good like pre-activation
drill for people who can't feel their
dealt
because there all you can do is out you
know right
you're almost forced to do it that way
25 there
fire that is straight fire
good lord
so i think this is a decent teaching
point because a lot of people have this
i think misconception that if you're
gonna do full body you can't
also train hard i think it depends on
the exercise i wouldn't do this with
like a barbell overhead press with all
those reps
and all that intensity right yeah but on
something like a lateral raise
relatively small range of motion
relatively lightweight i could hit delts
tomorrow i could hit one exercise of
delts again tomorrow i'll be recovered
by then so
that's kind of the point like you just
have to use those
intensity techniques and apply that
effort appropriately to the right
exercise
it isn't that you can't do it at all
yeah right so that's
i think i don't think a lot of people
think about that they just think of it
in general
terms well the cluster sets hard or well
well depends on what you're doing
exactly
totally we're going to finish off with
some bicep isolation work now
because the pullovers are going to
target the long head of the triceps to a
decent degree we're not going to do any
triceps isolation
i've got a bit of triceps over here and
i generally
when doing the high frequency full body
will alternate
bicep and tricep isolation oh so on the
one day i do bicep and the next day i do
tricep okay
today we'll do bicep so i'm leaning back
elbows against the pads
perfect
perfect there we go nice
vein popping out yeah yeah
there you go when you curl you have to
curl like
the curl yeah your vein curling right
here yeah
curls up when you're curling i'm not too
scared to take the bicep work
to failure or really close to failure
either because
like i said i'm generally alternating
day to day so if i do three sets of
biceps one day i'm not hitting it again
for like 48 hours i'm good to go even if
i take them to failure so i'd rather
like play it safe than sorry with the
bicep work especially since it's a weak
point for me
so i usually program the intensity a
little higher for these when it comes to
full body training
the way i'm currently doing is high
frequency approach with that
recovery management becomes so much more
important like you have to sequence the
exercises properly not only in the
workout
but throughout the week as well to
manage your recovery
beginners don't need to do that really
three full body workouts done three
times a week
much more minimal you don't need to have
the intensity techniques you don't even
need to have the same exercise variation
you can just do basic compound lifts two
to three days a week you'll be good
as you get more advanced you will need
more volume to progress
and so those three full body workouts
might not be enough
especially if they start to get really
long and your performance starts to
taper off
so that's where the high frequency full
body split comes in you do a little less
per muscle per workout you just spread
it out evenly across those five days
what i found is people tend to make a
couple mistakes one
is they try to do too much that can
either be too many compound exercises
too much volume per workout or too hard
per workout
do you want to start out lighter and
slower and with
less volume um then as you adapt to it
your recovery will improve to the point
that you can start including some of the
stuff that we did here especially if
you're more
advanced and you're more experienced and
that will be fine
as long as you know you're not doing too
much um
i would say this if you
find that you can't get to a point where
you can push yourself
like we did you know today on a full
body split
then i don't think there's enough of an
advantage to full body training
that it overrides not being able to push
it hard you know what i mean
so like if you can only be like uh like
i just can't recover on this so i'm
gonna have to go super light and super
easy
you should just do a full you should
just do upper lower push pull legs or a
body part split it'd be more effective
because you'd be able to push it harder
but if you can get to a point where
you're adapted and you can push
sufficiently hard
similar to what we did today on full
body then i think it's it's appropriate
so this is the first i've ever seen like
this this is a seated calf raise machine
and then it duels as an anterior
tibialis machine so work in the front
part of your calf
i bet you've never seen that before like
that
that's really cool
okay all right let's see what this is
all about
so we lift this up and now just pull
them back oh yeah
all right okay that's it
oh my goodness
you see this
do you legitimately train your tibialis
interior okay so when i had the absolute
best progress in my calves i was super
setting
you ever seen one of the hammer machines
where you sit down and they're like that
yeah hammer makes a machine it's just a
little one where you sit down so
when you superset staining raises and
the tibia
raises yeah massive pump your lower leg
that's the fastest my calves ever grew
interesting and high high frequency wow
i was doing five days a week set here
set there i get so here i get really bad
shin splints when i play a lot of
basketball
um so i feel like that would probably
help help me all right so we're gonna do
three sets of ten to twelve here
supersetting the seated calf raise with
the
anterior tibialis exercise um and that's
gonna be a wrap for the workout
[Music]
all right what's going on guys so i just
wanted to hop on here and say what's up
i am back
in jacksonville florida right now i just
realized it's been
four months since i did that collab with
john in ohio
and it has been absolutely insane but i
did want to come on here and give you
guys a little update
um i've been enjoying a bit of downtime
actually been hitting a bunch of new pr
so i'll make sure i keep you guys
updated on all of that um in a video
very soon
make sure you go over to john's channel
we actually did a couple videos over
there you guys might like i'll make sure
i link them
down below um don't forget to leave me a
thumbs up if you enjoyed the video
subscribe if you haven't already
and i'll see you guys all here in the
next one
nice nice shot
