what's up youtube
izzy navarros
trevor fulbright they're back
i was gonna say the hardest training men
in fitness that's an interesting claim
to make but i'm comfortable claiming it
fuck it i said it
these guys are
out of this world with the training
intensity and training intensity here
means something very specific the
ability to consistently push
to and past your limits while
maintaining good technique while the
pain is in your face
i don't train as hard as these guys i
never will
fuck all that but they're going to train
hard for all of us asmr for you guys
legs
hamstring curls
then leg press
ben smith machine squats pain becomes us
all ready set go
[Music]
two things first we're going to be doing
leg curls
izzy seems to be very fast witch
dominant at least from our current
understanding physiology is my best
guess
he fails really quick he needs heavier
loads he does lots of drop sets trevor
is a slow twitch machine so he just
keeps going so he's going to be doing
these leg presses with meyer wrap drops
which means that he's going to do one
set of like 15 to 20 and then all the
other sets are that same number let's
say 18 reps it's 18 18 18 it uses my
reps to get to those other sets when
easy's done he's done so that's going to
be the big difference
obviously look at their technique these
guys are technique gods and the other
thing is have you guys ever tried to eat
chalk you think you're hardcore you're
saying you're trying to get jacked try
eating some chocolate see how hardcore
you are
right now
i'm not that hardcore
way to call me out let's got the video
guys
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
go
[Music]
to quote scott from earlier i've never
seen anyone grind a leg curl except for
trevor
that would never happen to me
yeah when i'm done it just doesn't move
anymore do anything dude fuck yeah
[Music]
all the way down it look that stretch
yes
[Music]
come on
oh yeah
[Music]
oh fuck more bro more
[Music]
more
[Music]
tell me that fucking hit oh way better
than the first one yes
that looks painful you guys are going to
see two interesting things that are
being done here
one and this was trevor's idea
is to put the yoga mat
right under the knees what that does is
it extends the lever arm and lets this
machine which is a good machine it's not
a great machine
it lets you get an unreal crazy
hamstring stretch at the bottom because
it basically allows the machine to
experience like a three inch range of
motion increase i bet you a lot a lot of
you out there want that three inch range
motion increase huh
anyway
the second thing that's going on is
you'll notice
they set the pins in the right position
for themselves that
if this is their their their foot back
here and their hip over here
the roller slides at the stretch over
this way being leveraged to be very
difficult and as they come up the roller
slides close that basically matches the
force curve of the leg curl which means
they get all the fucking juice out of
the movement and it's not like oh i
could do way more partial reps but at
the top it's too hard
i don't typically set up like this and
that's because i don't know everything
and i clearly been doing shit not
optimally and i will be doing the shit
from now on
fucking
good stuff try it at home
get permission from your grandma
four
go
go
[Music]
i think he's losing parts of his soul
he's using dark magic i got a long rest
for trevor's three breaths yeah yeah
that would do for me
i would get more tired
that's where the lactate flows the
lactic acid flows out of the muscles and
into the nerves that's three seconds and
then i feel more pain
good shit trevor
what do you think one more set
all done here okay
i think like
maybe like five
reps the percent sure three two one
good gosh good stuff
good stuff
[Music]
hamstring curls are done
leg press time
we're gonna crush it on this
izzy's probably going to do like three
or four sets
trevor's probably gonna do like four or
six sets
mile reps for trevor
is he fatigued so fast
that when he's gone close to failure
that's usually it see if we can eke out
one or two maya rep reps
not sets from him see how that goes and
then when the quads are nice and cooked
we'll finish off with this machine
squats
prepare yourselves
[Music]
yep
[Music]
it can rack with one you just have to
re-rack it
i'm definitely not using that much
weight
so i'm definitely not using that much
weight you want four or 455 i think
four four
[Music]
14.
[Music]
15. you got another one
[Music]
16.
18 is the goal total
[Music]
good one more
[Music]
go go
[Music]
you can drop it a little drop the rep
range probably do five again
what do you want four how big is the
drop-off gonna be for you it's i'm gonna
pre i might lose half my reps even going
to four okey dokey four it
is go one more
[Music]
oh fuck yeah deep
[Music]
easy
[Music]
go go go
yeah let's go
[Music]

so people say like you know like uh

trevor
i watch their videos
on instagram and has some combination of
i ain't shit or i just shudder and then
i show up to the gym and i'm like you

whenever you guys recover feel free to
start warming up for the smith machine
squat
i'm gonna take a quick break to uh
order you guys um
some pizza
yeah
i don't want to cool off think of it
this way you know if you sit down it's
extra quad work getting back up
that might work for me actually super
set leg breasts with getting off a bench
with a chair
[Music]
you guys okay with pauses at the bottom
of these
yep
yes
sure
smith machine high bar feet forward
close stance squats with a pause that's
a lot of shit to say well just a lot
brother y'all need to fucking bar
anyway it's a cool exercise give it a
shot these folks are technique masters
do everything they do
uh and you'll be good to go their quads
are bright so we didn't need a whole lot
of weight to do the job
probably two maybe three sets
and then
the guys de-atomize and return back to
their place in the universe and then
when they have their next workout they
re-atomize form humans and train
let's get it done
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
what do you think one more
