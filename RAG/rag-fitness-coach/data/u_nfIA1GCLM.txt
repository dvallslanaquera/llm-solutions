if you become pretty jacked and lean and
you like the result and you like the
process get huge and nasty 100% if you
struggle with either getting jacked or
getting lean or even both but you love
the change and you love the challenge
then do it up it's awesome if you just
want to be healthy and you don't really
care about how you look then
congratulations you're a normal fuing
person you can just lift weights a few
times a week play all your favorite
sports and do all your favorite hobbies
eat like a reasonable person most of the
time and enjoy your life cuz you're not
a psychotic overly infatuated with
yourself asshole like the rest of
us
