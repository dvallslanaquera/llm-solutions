here's a cool one you won't see in many
places non rotating bar just happens to
be colored red blood I bought it off a
vampire so in any case here's the thing
you plug it in like this notice there's
no rotation so if you put your Versa
grips or straps in it locks and that way
if your grip is limiting factor on pull
downs and you're just like I can't
get this to work right my forms
always pump up and even on regular pull
uh down bar it's a rotating bar so even
if you have reversal grip sometimes the
surch to slip away if you try this bar
notice thin and non- rotating holy
 with a lot of these bars
you can feel like your grip is stapled
in and then it's all back which is two
things one you get more reps limited Now
by your lats instead of your forearms
and two if your grip isn't a thing you
have to think about anymore if it's
locked in with straps or Versa grips or
chalk then all you have to do is think
about your back which is great because
you get a better mind muscle connection
