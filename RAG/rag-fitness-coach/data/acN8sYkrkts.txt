hey folks
dr mike isrtel here for renaissance
periodization rp
plus hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture number what are we at
24 we have the most important individual
training differences
we have listed 16 of them these are from
the upcoming or depending on when you
watch this already released
scientific principles of hypertrophy
training book and in the
chapter on individual differences which
is the last chapter of the book last
main chapter
we cover a bunch of examples 16 of them
that are what we consider the most
important variables to keep mindful of
uh that are different between
individuals when designing programs when
evaluating programs when selecting
programs so on and so forth
uh here's the list on the first slide
for you you can pause the video if you'd
like and look at it
and scroll to one that you like we're
going to take all of them
are there more than 16 variables of
course did we miss some probably pretty
important ones yes
but this is kind of a grand tour and
it's not so much
to show you how to treat every single
one of these because we could do a whole
lecture on every single one of these and
the book actually has more or less that
um
the point is uh to give you some
examples uh to cover the very important
things but also give you examples
of okay individuals are different uh
both you know
between individuals and within one
individual over time what are some
examples of how that can change
programming can change our approach what
do we look at differently
after this lecture you should have a
much more nuanced view
of program design and really understand
it when someone says well individual
differences
matter you'll understand how they matter
and have a really good toolbox to apply
to when you design your own program or
evaluate a program you'll have a lot of
really good things to keep in mind
to know you know how much individual
differences do play a role and maybe how
much they don't
so let's get right into it first one and
uh these are not
necessarily in order of importance but
probably the more important ones are are
higher on the list
or rather first so work capacity is our
first one
and how you know we have two two
breakdowns we'll do for each one of
these
is presentation how it presents in the
training sphere and then
major implications that we want to list
what it take home
how to modify your program so on and so
forth so the presentation of work
capacity
is that some lifters will just be able
to do a whole lot more work in the gym
than others and the more hypertrophy
specific way of putting it is some
lifters
will have uh be able to do a lot more
non-junk volume because you could use
anyone can just do volume if you keep
them in the gym long enough
but if they get so tired that their
systemic fatigue limits their local
muscle activation
you know that those reps at the local
muscles start to be very very far from
local muscular failure
not great but some folks can crank out
sets too close to local muscular failure
endlessly and some folks have two or
three sets per session they can do and
then they're pooped
so it's a work capacity difference and
it doesn't necessarily we we have one
next as a recovery ability where
capacity recoverability are very very
related but they're not exactly the same
thing because you'd be able to put out
a crazy amount of work in one workout
but not be able to repeat that workout
for five or six days
because your recovery ability is low on
the other hand your work capacity could
be very low
but your recovery ability to be high so
as soon as you've done that workout
gee later that day you can repeat that
although short and unimpressive workout
but generally speaking
folks that have higher work capacity
also have a higher recovery ability
because we know that work capacity means
there's only so much volume you can do
until you get junk volume
you should know that there's a huge
variation
between lifters and even within lifters
on how much of that
volume can you do until it becomes junk
and thus what you want to do
is for most folks that you're training
for the first time including yourself
you want to start with lower volumes
because biting off more than you can
choose way worse than just not biting
enough
start with lower volumes make sure
they're not junk volumes and then
raise them as work capacity is both
elucidated and increased
elucidated means just revealed right so
like at some point you could say okay
here's three sets of bench
you know roughly 10 reps and someone
could do it and be like okay sweet that
was
pretty easy and i feel like i can do way
more sweet okay next next week we'll try
that
next week you go to four five six et
cetera and it turns out they can do
they can squash a 10 set of chest
workout or 12 set of chest workout no
problem and their work capacity over the
week means they could squash
you know like a hundred total sets of
chest or something no problem at all
you found out that they just have
genetically very good work capacity in
addition to that people's work capacity
changes with training
so as they train over the period of
weeks for sure and months and years work
capacity can go up so don't just assume
someone's going to get tired after a
certain amount of work and also don't
assume that they can do a certain amount
of work
start low titrate up from there based on
their ability to do the work
that is ability to have really really
great sessions where they're not
centrally or systemically limited from
activating their target muscles
at the end of the day some people the
genetic gap still exists
after years of training so if someone
starts with a very low work capacity and
their work capacity improves a little
bit
they could say you know my work capacity
really sucks five years training later
there's probably not much they can do to
really really raise their work capacity
without changing their training
altogether for to not be hypertrophy
remember work capacity is not a huge
deal
the magnitude of response is really what
we're looking for we'll have something
to say about that later
number two variable recovery ability
okay some lifters can recover
both performance wise and from soreness
uh
and if they don't get sore by the way
that's an increase that's an indicator
of high work capacity
they could just recover more from per
session volumes and more per week
volumes
right and the easy implication there
because we beat this concept to death in
every other rp video
is start with lower volumes proxy
fatigue very carefully to make sure you
understand
if they have too much fatigue or if they
have plenty of room to spare and then
slowly titrate up or down as needed to
make sure people are within their
maximum recoverable volume
and there are going to be large
differences in recovery ability thus
programming volumes between two lifters
and even the same lifter over time is
going to be different
something that you're doing now volume
wise could have crushed you
five years ago and something that
someone else does could crush you
now or you could recover from it so
easily you could do double or triple the
work right so
very very important to understand that
recoverability is hugely variable
between individuals and within
and thus anyone who asks hey like what's
my mrv or what's the mrv
for chest they're looking for a very
average number among the entire
population but the bell curve is really
really large you could have somebody
who can't recover from more than eight
sets per week of chest work and somebody
who can comfortably recover from over
40.
right yeah so the average is kind of 20
somewhere in there in the 20s but
uh you know that there's a huge generic
variation and you have to make sure that
you're attending to that in your own
training
next is adaptive magnitude there's sort
of two discussions of adaptive magnitude
one is gain rate we'll talk about later
and one is adaptive magnitude in the
technical sense of how much better are
you getting uh
essentially session to session to
session so per any unit of stimulus
some folks get more growth than others
and also they get more uh work capacity
and also they get better strength so the
major implication here for adaptive
magnitude is
how fast you add weights or reps or sets
week to week to week and a sets thing is
a work capacity
thing but that's part of adaptive
magnitude so if you have to add a lot of
sets per week that means the work
capacity is expanding very highly
but there's also a question of adding
reps and adding weight you know some
people
and this this is by the way of course
varies hugely with training age which
will get to
itself as a training variable later but
if someone's a beginner
their uh adaptive magnitude could be
like they could put 15 pounds on their
squat or leg press every week for eight
weeks straight
and never lose a single rep right be in
the same rir or just
a little bit lower at the end of that
eight week period i mean there's nobody
at a high level that can do that not
even close
so at a high level or someone just with
different genetics they're going to be
able to add maybe two and a half pounds
every other week
and that's how fast they are adapting so
it's it's super super personal people
ask
all the time how much weight should i be
putting on the bar each week
and we have other videos that just
discuss that but essentially it's like
okay
what is your rr target next week did
three rar this week it was
you know 10 reps at 100 pounds next week
is two rar
target because rr should descend roughly
every week every two weeks
and then you know how much weight do you
put on the bar to get around 10 reps is
really the question and the answer to
that question is very very
different how fast do you get stronger
some people especially people with
really good genetics and people early in
their careers
uh can add pounds and pounds and pounds
at 10 pounds every time
some people with you know towards the
peak of their careers and
and or folks with not so great genetics
maybe add only two and a half pounds
every other week or something like that
right so there's no one golden answer it
has to be an auto regulated which is
super super important don't
expect folks to be making some
predictable jumps that you're like oh i
wonder why they're not progressing
that question of wondering why they're
not progressing should be answered
holistically as to okay is their diet
good
is their recovery good is the program
fundamentally sound if those are
allowing us to check
check you still expect a great
difference right it's it's like
it's almost like expecting you know uh
everyone to score the same
on a standardized iq test or something
like that and if they don't score the
same
you think man you know there's something
in our population must be making some
people dumber and some smarter well
i think just genetically some people are
just more talented than others this is
not like uh
it's not even a very controversial thing
to say so expecting them all to be
exactly the same is ridiculous right you
expect everyone should be brought up as
high as possible
so if someone has something in their
lives which is like lead poisoning or
something and thus their iq is lower
that's a serious problem you should
address
right it's not like you know if the iq
distribution is still there and there
are some people that are smarter than
others
you're not going to be like oh there's
something super wrong about that
uh this same thing with adaptive
magnitude some people just make gains
faster
and have to be fed that because imagine
someone who's making really fast gains
but you're like no no no
two and a half pounds every other week
that's the only way we increase they're
gonna
really quickly get so far away from the
zero
reps in reserve that they're gonna have
very very inefficient training and vice
versa
much worse probably is when you try to
take someone who can only gain two and a
half pounds of strength on the bar
every other week and try to push them
into 10 10 pounds every week
we've all done that right especially
transitioning from beginners to
intermediates we still think you have
beginner gains but you don't
and you keep hitting walls walls walls
that's actually how you discover a
maximum recovery volume a lot because
you're like i used to be able to do that
but i can't
right no shame in that it's all
adjustments to the individual
and the breadth of variation is going to
be very large expect that
volume landmarks super straightforward
because we've written like gazillion
things about this
the amount of work you need to do
maintenance volume minimum effective
volume maximum adapter volume maximum
recovery volume is going to be different
between lifters and within lifters over
the same time course so
the major implication here is that one
size fits all programming is absolutely
no place
in a scientifically based programming
scheme like we're describing to you here
you gotta at least try to roughly
estimate all of these volume landmarks
even if it takes some time
and always continually update them
because not only do different lifters
get different ones to start with
but they change over time we used to be
your mrv might no longer be mrv it might
be higher it might be lower
only through proper auto regulator
training that detects performance
and soreness and so on and so forth can
we get really good
running data on how best to program for
that
anthropometry people are built
differently
their limb lengths are different their
limb ratios are different okay so some
people
have really short torsos and really long
arms and vice versa
uh really short legs long arms short
arms long legs etc etc
their joint designs are different some
people have shoulder joints they're very
very mobile some people that are less
mobile some people that are very
embarrassingly less mobile hips
so on and so forth uh all these all the
joints that you can think of
have different levels of mobility and
structural capacity so on and so forth
between individuals
flexibilities on the net balance are
different some people can do a stiff leg
another with a tight back that goes
below the floor if they're holding a bar
some people can go just below their
knees and their hands are tight not a
thing wrong with that you just have to
address that right so here's the thing
two major implications one
techniques have to be uh
only general when you say how do i do a
bent over row there should be only
generally probably about
five tips and then everything else
should be tailored around the
differences
of the lifter for example even where you
pull the bent over row
is it till the belly button is it right
into the hip is it to
the lower chest that is going to be
different based on limb ratios like if
your
torso is really long and your arms are
really short versus the other way around
you're going to be pulling for the same
lat activation generally
and the same rhomboid activation you're
going to be pulling into two different
spots potentially
that's a big difference right it's not
all the same and
so you start with basic techniques for
everyone and then individually
people will alter their techniques over
time in addition to that
some exercises and some techniques will
just favor some individuals versus
others so they'll have their preferences
because they are built differently and
stimulus to fatigue ratio analysis from
earlier lectures
will be the guide okay if you say to
someone here hack squats
they're great do them and they're like
my knees hurt i don't feel my quads my
knees hurt i don't feel like quads and
you sort of fixed everything you know
you can fix
why still doing hack squats you put them
on a high bar squat and they're like oh
my god my quads are blowing up my knees
feel great are you really going to say
well no you should be able to do hack
squats
no because they could just be built
differently a better example still is
that a lot of people with really short
torsos and long femurs
high bar squatting any squatting really
it's not the best way for them to hit
their quads because
their ratios make squatting very
posteriorly chain limited
right it's really their ability to good
morning the weight that's limiting them
not their quads
so if you want them to have their best
quad development and buy sfr they're
going to feel this
leg presses and hack squats are going to
be way better it's crazy that i'm saying
this right mr freeway compound barbell
they're gonna be way better than uh
barbell back squats that doesn't mean
you never do squats again but that means
as a first exercise
you might wanna do uh hack squats you
might wanna do leg presses and then
later when your quads are more limiting
factor or rather theirs
then you thread those in so always be on
the lookout some exercises just won't
jive with people and that's totally fine
try your best to integrate them and make
sure they're doing them right
but after that things will look
different and people have their
preferences and that's totally fine
there are no
sort of golden standards there next one
is fiber type distribution this one's
tough to figure out but we have some
hints of it
based on how much endurance people have
like set to set drop-off will be very
low they'll do like
ten ten ten nine nine nine where someone
with a very faster twitch dominant will
be like ten
four five or five four three three one
or something like that because those
fibers lose endurance super quickly best
rate
rep range growth response people with a
faster fiber type very likely
prefer lower rep ranges that's where
their sfr is best
right um specifically on the stimulus
side they get better pumps
more robust muscle disruption they get
uh you know
huge perception of tension in the target
muscle mind muscle connection
from lower reps versus higher reps if
they're fast twitch slow twitch and the
other way around
so the implications here is that some
lifters and for some of their muscles
will get to the individual muscle stuff
later as its own variable
they'll just uh you'll eventually have
to bias their training
into higher rep ranges or lower up
ranges into moderate ones or lower ones
and so on and so forth
and there's also frequency biasing issue
faster switch fibers don't recover as
fast as slower switch fibers for for the
same dose of training let's say eight
sets
a faster twitch in muscle or individual
can be recovered three or four days
later where a slower twitch one one or
two
so slower twitch individuals actually
can tolerate longer
bouts of higher frequency training and
more successfully
they also tend to be not a strong which
means that their joints don't take as
much of a beating again
furthering that divide so if you have a
muscle or your individual generally
that's more slower twitch
higher frequency programs are just going
to be on average even if we take into
account
uh account block changes right lower and
then higher and then higher still
the average frequency will be higher for
folks with slower twitch fibers
than faster switch fibers and
interestingly enough if you take a look
at folks with the fastest twitch fibers
on average
they're usually the ones that end up
being professional bodybuilders
and it's kind of no coincidence that a
lot of those folks train with very low
frequency
usually because they can't recover
they're also super strong so you tell a
professional bodybuilder to train his
back with bent over rows hard twice a
week
he's going to be neither recovered at
the muscular level nor the connective
tissue level potentially for something
like that so something to keep in mind
as to why we see differences
right responses different growth
pathways hypothetically or
rather theoretically some folks will get
a ton out of tension some folks will get
a good response out of just mechanical
tension
but some folks really really get a ton
of metabolites others don't
some to sell swelling others don't so
the implication here is that you just
have to bias towards rep range and
techniques where the folks
have the highest sfrs but notice how
important of a concept a stimulus to
fatigue ratio is right especially
that part uh not especially but
particularly the part of
you know the stimulus checklist of you
know do you have a mind muscle
connection
are you uh getting pumps and
are you getting muscle disruption and
those sort of three items which are an
early lecture
checklist folks will get them in
different rep ranges based on which
growth pathways you exploit some people
you know who get a huge response out of
cell swelling
and who get a really huge disruption out
of metabolite stuff
uh you know they'll do mile reps and
it'll change their life they're like oh
my god
my biceps i feel like there's something
deep inside my biceps that's wrong
whereas some other folks that go on
straight mechanical tension my reps
start with a set of 10 to 20 reps
they might do that and be like oh i'm
tired and then they're just tired tired
tired
and they do more sets i'm like you know
are you pumped like yeah i don't not
really
but you know i'm just not getting the
tension i feel like and then you have
them do
straight sets of eight dumbbell curls
and they're like this is the greatest
like feeling of tension i've ever gotten
my muscles like i swear to god this is
awesome and then i get really sore
so that's just different growth pathway
responses it can alter muscle to muscle
as well
so some something to keep an eye on her
always apply stimulus to fatigue ratio
and bias your training into where it
seems to be indicating the most effect
number eight this is much more of a
theoretical point but just
something to keep in mind is initial
muscle sizes are hugely individually
different and there's tons of genetic
variation
not everyone starts with the same muscle
size so the implications here uh
is that you know if you look at someone
who's been training maybe a few years
and they're really jacked
uh versus someone that's been training a
few years and they're not so jacked
that person who is jacked may not know
anything more
than the person who's not so jacked they
just started with more muscle
at the same time and we'll talk about
gain rates actually in the next slide
they could have not only started with
more muscle but they're gained faster
too on sheer genetics
so you see oh man you know like that guy
he's uh
you know he really has things figured
out he's only been lifting for three
years and he's huge well you really
think someone has been lifting for three
years is it all figured out unless he
has a genius iq and has been studying
exercise science in school for years
before he started lifting you know it's
probably like just probably just
genetics right
what you really want to look for more
than how big someone is
especially when they're early in their
career how big do they get later in
their career and also
given where they started have they made
impressive gains you know show me
someone who started 120 pounds
and over time earned their gains to get
to 150 160
i'll show you someone to probably figure
some things out show me someone who
started at 150 160 pounds
and then is 170 a couple years later i'm
don't color me impressed but that's 170
lifter versus a 150 lifter in the first
example
a lot of people will see that 170 lifter
be like that guy clearly knows what he's
doing which could be the furthest from
the truth
look to people who have made gains given
their genetics
not ridden their genetics to either
start really big or make
big gains which takes us to number nine
which is gain rates our next
uh individual changing variable
uh the higher adaptive magnitudes in the
short term that we talked about earlier
usually lead to different gain rates in
the long term and at a biochemical level
some people just gain muscle faster
plain and simple even if they don't get
that much stronger as you would expect
so this is kind of like a pretty gnarly
one
because it's like super super reality
slap in the face point but here's the
deal
individuals with better gain rates
usually respond best to all programs
like you look at people who are really
genetically well off
and you say hey like how did you grow
your legs and they're like look i've
tried
five through one i tried it west side
juggernaut method
i did like hst training i did
you know uh dog crap i did all that
stuff and like which one was
best and they're like man they all
worked my legs got huge and everyone
you're like
okay thanks for nothing like that's
great
and on the flip side there are folks
who are hard gainers who are going to be
looking for this magic program that's
going to turn them into an easy gainer
i can promise you right now that doesn't
exist
almost every easy gainer was an easy
gainer
their entire time
that they lifted period
alternatively some people
can figure out that they were doing
something very wrong and when they
change it
they unlock some really really good
gains not nearly as common
but to think if you're not doing
something really wrong like training it
double your mrv consistently or
half of your mv or something if
nothing's really
wrong with your program you can do
better with a better program but it
won't be this order of magnitude better
right you're not
climbing trees to get to the moon that's
just not going to happen right
so if you're basically riding the
equivalent of a bicycle for your gains
and someone's riding the equivalent of a
race car no mods to your bike are going
to get you to race car speed
but they could get you from 30 miles an
hour to 50 miles an hour
whereas the race car is going from 180
to 250 or something right
different different sort of dynamic
there so don't compare yourself to other
people and be like why is he getting
gains like that do your best
and a lot of it is very very much
genetic there's some not so great
but hints of direct research into this
where they found that changes in program
design
don't account for hardly 10 percent of
the differences you see just genetically
between individuals
so and this is a point i've made before
if you see an ifb pro with pex as thick
as phone books
you probably unproductively asking the
question of
what exact rep range does he do is it
the cable flies or is it the pack deck
for the love of god it's mom and dad
mom and dad and you know our all of our
favorite parent the needle
right am i right that will stare a joke
there but on a serious note
um you know that person clearly
dedicated themselves for years they
clearly ate a hypercaloric diet that's
one of those big fixes that can change a
bunch of things
but the minutia is not where it's at
gain rates are different for people
it's just something you have to accept
and work your best with
period maximum growth potential
different than gain rates believe it or
not as soon so your maximum growth
potential is essentially
a two-factor problem factor one is you
start with muscle cells and they can
individually hypertrophy
until they get only so big and then
factor two is
these muscle cells can take nuclei that
are in your satellite cells
the nuclei donate into the muscle cell
and thus they can get even bigger
because they don't get big past a
certain point
when the nucleus can't communicate to
the outsides of the cell
that's called the myonuclear domain
ceiling it's like having a
like one city government for a city of a
million people is fine
but a city of like 35 million people
that spans 200 miles like
probably gonna have to get some suburbs
going in there because the one city
government is gonna do that real poor
like
you know imagine the size of their their
bus system
like parking lot it's gonna be insane
right and that's the equivalent
of your nucleus it can only control so
much area around it so
once your individual cells grow as big
as they can so
and this happens rather smoothly
satellite cells start getting inserted
when you run out of satellite cells it's
still not clear to researchers that you
can replicate satellite cells
the answer the best guess is in 80 20
probably not
or just not to a great extent so when
you run out
of my nuclear domain and then all the
other satellite
cells incorporate and your final muscle
cell size for every cell
you just don't grow much hardly at all
right
when this occurs depends both on how
fast incorporation occurs and how good
your training is and how much weight
you're gaining
but largely depends on how many
satellite cells you have
because if you have a really big initial
muscle cells and this has already been
shown
to be the case in real individuals you
can actually start out pretty jacked
and you can get really fast gain rates
too but then after two or three years
you sort of peter out and you just don't
get
many more gains whereas other people who
started out smaller their individual
cells are smaller but they have this
crazy huge
dormant pool of satellite cells and they
continually get inserted and certain
certain cells grow grow grow grow and
all of a sudden
they look like mr olympia and they're
done growing 25 years later
thing is you don't know which one of
those people you are and you won't until
you hit plateaus
and try to solve them with your best
approaches and only then realize okay
this is just about as big as i'm going
to be getting
occurs differently for some people some
people reach their plateau after
gee really like you know three or four
years more likely like five to seven for
many people
and not absolute plateau but when the
stuff goes like this
he's still making gains but very very
slowly and for some folks they literally
get robust gains
for 20 years or more and you know you
don't know which one you are so before
you say you're at your genetic ceiling
keep training for a few years just to
make sure and apply all your best
strategies
sorry and lastly you don't know what
your maximum growth potential is
there are averages for populations for
sure but you could be a very big
exception to that
so don't think okay i'm five foot nine i
went to this online calculator and some
of these are pretty good calculators
i should weigh 170 pounds you don't know
that try your best and you made end up
all of your best weapons put forward
over five years you might end up at 155
or all of your best weapons put forward
after five years you may end up at 205
pounds in a natural world pro
you never know you just have to try
next general muscle shape this one's
really really straightforward the
general shape of your muscle with some
exceptions that there's some regional
growth
is really really highly genetically
determined okay that doesn't mean it's
100 genetically determined but it's
really really high
so any program that pours a lot of
resources into changing the muscle shape
or reshaping it
versus just general generally getting it
bigger is probably a bit misuse of
resources so a lot of times folks
with not so big quads say you know like
i really want more outer quad sweep
which leg extension variables should i
like do which way should i point my feet
and my my first thought is usually like
you can put your feet where the hell you
want nobody's gonna notice your quad
sweep if your quads are the size of
pencils
why don't you get your quads really big
that's the real best way
to use your time your actually as a
muscle gets bigger it fundamentally
changes shape as well because that size
changes its shape
and you know like if you have a bicep
that's really small it looks long and
stringy
doesn't really matter what shape it is
eventually going to be as it grows it
almost certainly grows more in the
middle
and everyone gets a bigger bicep peak
when they get bigger so first
really put your your uh you know your
efforts into getting bigger overall
and when you do put your efforts into
changing muscle shape know that those
are very very small differences that you
may not ever realistically be able to
detect in your program
and also if clients come to you and say
i want to change your shape of my
muscles you had better be giving them
some version of this talk that that's
not a very wise thing to do
intramuscular sorry intermuscular
differences this one is huge
different muscles in the same lifter
will differ greatly
in nearly all of the variables that were
listed before
okay their mrv their mev
their adaptive rate their peak
adaptation some people will say you know
my triceps respond really well
to train you but my biceps simply won't
grow what am i doing wrong well you
maybe do nothing wrong
your triceps just have bigger initial
cell size and a huge myonuclear domain
or sorry a huge
uh reserve of satellite cells and your
biceps may have neither or some some you
know less optimal combination of those
two things
you were just you were destined to have
bigger triceps than biceps does that
mean you need to not optimize for bicep
training anymore no of course not
you just have to have realistic
expectations and
because muscles can uh different fiber
type uh
differences and also in which pathways
they respond best to
you have to understand that you have to
seek your volumes
and your sfrs for every single muscle by
itself
okay if three sets of ten or you know
sets of eight
really strict work really well for your
hamstrings something completely
different tons of my reps could work
better for your chest
you just never know so what we really
don't want is for you to take something
about your body or particular set of
muscles
just automatically apply it to
everything else here's another really
big problem people will say like hey
what program did you go back grow best
from was it a heavy program or lighter
program
the real answer to that usually is like
well you know some of my muscles grow
really well from heavier training some
grow well from lighter training for
example my own training
my hamstrings grow super super well in
my glutes as well
from relatively lower ups and heavy
weight and my quads are sort of
intermediate whereas my side delts
that's not nearly the case so when
someone says like hey do you like
training heavy for size or like for size
but really depends on the muscle
and of course a combination of all of
them for everything but there's just a
certain amount
of growth i won't be able to get for
sets of 30 for hamstrings that will
absolutely be able to get for side delts
or rear dots or something like that so
that's absolutely something to keep in
mind don't just assume there's one rep
range for your whole body
training age is not biological age
training age is how long you've been
training
and as you train hard for years and
years your responses predictably differ
now here's the predictably part it just
gets harder to get gains
given any input variable you need more
volume but you can recover from less
okay you need more proximity to failure
you need higher frequencies but you
can't recover from as many
the window narrows so a real big
take-home message for this is
stuff that work well for you as a
beginner will not necessarily work best
for you now training has to change
and because a lot of people will say man
you know back and i've literally heard
people say this my own clients in many
cases
you know back in high school i did this
a three by three bench program and i
gained 50 pounds on my bench i was like
what was your bench when you started
they're like 135 what was it when you
ended 185
sweet so to get a 185 bench that's a
great program
now we're trying to get you to 3 30. do
you really think the same program is
going to be great and we could even try
it and it turns out the program sucks
and be like what happened what's
different
your situation is very different right
like you know if you
go if you're a green beret or something
like that and you go sort of teach an
army how to fight
you know if they're like starting off
with nobody's had combat experience they
have sticks and stones the way you teach
them is going to be very different
and what is going to help them the most
is going to be very different from
people
that have been professionally trained
and know how to operate explosive
devices on their snipers and stuff
both can be made better but it's very
very different stuff and you can't just
be like you know what really worked
in our last mission was teaching people
how to throw rocks better
uh we should teach these professional
grenadiers how to do that but they
already know this is insane and they
have grenades not rocks right it doesn't
make any sense at all
people do some training all the time to
think back to high school man what
really used to work for me is
that's a nice notion but you have to be
willing to adapt and
if you're looking at a pro bodybuilder
who's been training for 20 years
and you've been training for one or two
you may have serious serious problems
trying to apply their program to yours
because their training age is completely
different
next up related concept is biological
age just how old you are
older individuals can just generally
expect smaller gains
but they can also benefit from a more
methodical approach because the thing is
is that when you're older you know
30s especially 40s and 50s yes your
gains will be not as great as
when you were younger even if you just
start in your 40s and 50s
however you're probably not a stupid
person anymore that goes partying for
three days straight doesn't drink any
water or eat any food like you used to
when you're in your 20s and your raver
days
now you probably have a family and a job
and you're just a responsible person
you can execute a meticulous plan you
can make up a lot of difference not all
of it for younger populations just by
being
better at executing the plan when you're
older the worst thing in the world
and i've met folks like this who are in
their 40s 50s and 60s
and still have a bro mentality to
lifting like they'll disappear for a
while to do one body part per week like
to try to hit it hard and go to failure
and they just
wave their hands while they're out there
getting gains that's insane right they
need to be doing things more
intelligently
at the same time just make sure you're
realistic and if you have clients
make sure if they know this age is not
just a number
if you're 45 years old and you want to
put on muscle and get leaner you have to
have different expectations just
tempered ones
than if you're 25 years old and if you
say well back when i was in my 20s and i
was playing d1 ball
i was 260 with abs and now you're you're
57 years old like can i have that again
like no you can't have that again you'll
be only 57 year old 260 with abs
that's nonsense but you can do really
well just have to be realistic because
people say like this is one of these
things that's a personal pet peeve of
mine
uh basically these notions and sort of
saccharine
phrases people bandy about for no reason
at all to make themselves temporarily
feel good by
illusorying themselves to the world at
large uh one of my least favorite is age
is just a number it just makes no sense
on
any level other than to tell people hey
like just try your best you'll be fine
you're not dying
that's great the rest of it's totally
wrong age absolutely matters
you have to take it into account next
one is sex
sex is a good thing people like to have
sex and you probably would too if you
weren't watching youtube videos all the
time
just kidding sort of uh sex here we mean
it's another term for gender
right male versus female in this case
and the thing is is that it's a little
bit different with males and females
females because you recover from and
benefit
from much higher per session volume uh
and relative volume and load combos
which is to say if you
have females do one rir sets of
roughly 10 reps they can crank crank
crank local muscular failure every
single time very little systemic
limitation
and get sets of like 11 11 11 10
10 9 9 9 and just keep going
whereas males a lot of times have a big
first set and they just crash
they just don't have the set to set
recovery ability
and the session to session recovery
ability females can usually do more
very high intensity frequency of
sessions per week
you give me a male that can do three per
week because you know genetic
counterpart female is going to be able
to do three or four
or sorry four or five sessions per week
no problem
so sfr should guide you in this if
you're using it intelligently with
female clients or if you yourself are
female
just know that it's not going to be the
same thing as our predominantly most of
this hypertrophy stuff
is something males do don't just copy
male programs
males may say you know anything for
chest more than two times a week and i'm
trashed
that's nice try yourself as a female
start low start with two sessions a week
you might end up being seeing that
there's like gaps in training when
you're not sore and you're completely
recovering you're just waiting around
for no reason
try three then try four and you might
see like oh my god with four times a
week i'm getting the best chess games of
my life where the hell did i ever do two
times a week
that's one of the predictable
differences another one to keep on the
lookout
this is very similar in that regard
females can do lots of heavy lifting
back to back to back to backs
that's that and session to session to
session and have no problems with
recovery
uh even our connective tissue level or
muscular level which is great
and the reason that's great is because
they'll have to use that to get good
gains because a lot of times for females
they're so
good at buffering and so not uh they
don't generate so many metabolites to
begin with and they're so good at
buffering them
that metabolite training uh drop sets
and supersets and stuff a lot of times
just don't work nearly as well for
females as they do for males
so that's definitely something to keep
in mind your female training
if you're a male trainer and you're
writing female training programs these
things should
baffle the shit out of you and shock you
and look at them
after a while and be like there's no way
anyone can survive this but females can
right you'll see them doing like heavy
back work four times a week
at sets of five to ten you'd be like if
i tried that my
lats would rip off my body i would be
vomiting blood by a week and a half
they can do it right and if you do a
workout with them you're like this is
going to be so hard we're going to
superset this to this to that
they just crank out all the supersets go
to failure and at the end of the workout
they're like okay
so i feel pretty good and you're like
what you're not going to die they're
like yeah i feel fine i'm
not really even cramping you're like how
the hell is it working metabolites
don't work as well with females so be
wary of that more hardcore heavy work
for them
and they'll they'll do just fine with it
another super quick one
females on average it's almost certainly
not true for everyone
on average they tend to probably
mis-estimate irr
different than males males probably come
closer to failure in their average set
if you just tell them they do two rir
males probably come closer to set uh
failure than females
so for the average female starting about
two or three rer at the beginning of
their program
and working up from there might be a
better idea than three or four rir which
is where you might start males so that's
something else to consider as well
next one pretty obvious one is lifestyle
individuals have different applications
this is this is why i said this
these are not an order of importance
because this one is hugely important
people have different applications of
how much sleep they get how much
relaxation they get how much nutrition
is on point versus not supplementation
so on and so forth
so major implications here is don't
expect folks with poor nutrition or poor
sleep
to recover from as much training as
those who get them right
and don't expect higher gain rates and
let your clients
know this as well and i've put a note to
myself here this the the wall street
story
uh myself and nick shaw the co-founder
of uh renaissance periodization
we used to train a lot of wall street
folks like literally in new york city at
a very high-end gym
and a lot of these folks would say
listen i can't eat super well i'm too
busy uh i don't get sleep i don't sleep
i work i'm
living life i'm workout i'm a workaholic
but i'm willing to come to the gym
every lunch hour and i'm willing to burn
it what can you do for me
if that's the case because i'm willing
to work extra to compensate for the
sleep and the food
you just have to tell them that it's
just not how it works you could bring
them down
gently you can bring them down not so
gently but at the end of the day
that's not a negotiable thing there's no
making up
for a very severely depleted lifestyle
and in some sense
if you decrease sleep and food your mrv
goes down you actually
can't train more the ideal response from
a stimulus fatigue perspective may
actually be to train less
which is crazy right in other words
there's just no getting around
the stuff you have to be keen on two
things one if there are lifestyle
differences
uh you have to integrate them into
training and understand that they're
going to limit mrv raise enemies so on
and so forth and two
make people aware of how important
lifestyle is so they don't think just
because they lift weights
they're good to go and they're going to
get all these great results and then if
they just lift more weights they're
going to get great results even if
everything else
sucks if you get good sleep you're
getting good nutrition and you're really
doing a good job
you'll be one step ahead of the curve in
that one
summarize this entire lecture
all programs should begin when you don't
know the lifter or if it's yourself
with lower volumes and lower average
frequencies because it's better to be
safer than sorry in this case
right then you need to adjust volumes
and frequencies
as needed based on very different
responses you'll get some people will be
able to do a lot of volumes some people
either progress really fast
some people will be able to do highly
frequent training more often some won't
it's not something you push it's
something you detect and alter
for and the same exact process of
starting conservative and working in
works for exercise selection rest times
techniques all the way down the line
people are different the fundamentals
work for everyone but once you establish
the core fundamentals
pay attention to responses and alter
training as needed
for essentially the highest gain rates
per an individual
and the highest stimulus to fatigue
ratios to give you a hint at what those
gain rates can be folks
that's it see you next time
you
