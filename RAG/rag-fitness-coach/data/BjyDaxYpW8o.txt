so in this video i'm asking five highly
qualified experts one of the most
important questions in fitness
how hard should we train so mike i was
going to
pose you the question i've been posing
to everyone else how hard
is it that we should be training in the
gym okay
i'm ready are we recording yet how hard
should we be training in the gym
as hard as you need to that is honestly
it's a really difficult question
that that is as succinct as i can get
yeah that was amazing now just to
quickly make sure
everyone's on the same page there are
two terms you'll need to know to keep up
our pe stands for rating of perceived
exertion and it basically just ranks how
hard a set was
on a scale of 1 to 10. so an rpe of 10
means you had zero reps in reserve an rp
of 9 means you could have got one more
rep if you pushed it all the way to
failure
and so on and then rir stands for reps
and reserve and it's basically the
inverse of rpe
so a zero rir means you had zero reps in
reserve and that would be the same as
saying rp10
and rir of one is the same as rpe 9 and
so on
so up first i spoke with dr mike isratel
and he explained to me his basic
philosophy that
even though it might be tempting we
shouldn't always train as hard as
possible
because we need to consider how fatigue
from going too hard
might impact future training sessions a
lot of folks will say
you gotta train hard enough to make
gains and that's true
that's true as far as it goes if it
doesn't go far enough i think we could
do a little bit better we can say
you have to train hard enough to make
gains but not so hard that your next
workout suffers
and it becomes a situation where your
next workout is unable to make you gains
because you went too hard then
throughout our chat he emphasized that
it ultimately depends on where you are
in your training phase or mesocycle
where at the beginning of a four to
eight week training program you should
train
less hard and with lower volumes but
then toward the end of a mesocycle you
should train
very hard and with more volume and we
can get a little bit more technical as
to what it means to train
hard enough to make gains i'm gonna
start at a load that gets you
oh somewhere close to three reps in
reserve and then as far as volume
you want to start towards the lower end
of the number of sets that's probably a
volume
where you know you get notably fatigued
in the target muscle you don't want to
leave the gym and be like my biceps feel
100 fine it's probably not stimulative i
wouldn't bet that it's stimulative um
you probably want to get a small pump
you know if you get a massive pump it'll
probably come with a ton of soreness at
the front end you may not want uh but no
pump at all is
curious uh unlikely to stimulate
hypertrophy at least nearly optimally
and you probably want to get uh you know
maybe like a little bit sore at most a
little bit
you start roughly three reps in reserve
and then every week after that during
your accumulation phase you're going to
increase
something a little bit some combination
of increasing load and or reps
more or less every session that you do
the same thing every week and
you want to make sure the load and rep
increases maintain or reduce
rar by roughly one each week so that
means you could potentially
do your next week three r your next week
three hour or next week through an hour
that's a fine way to train
but uh if your next week is two ir and
then the one after is one or ir and then
the one after a zero rr that's totally
cool too which you don't want is a
situation
in which you're not adding enough reps
and load each week and what ends up
happening is
your reps and reserve actually go up so
you don't want to start a three rir and
then end up a four rar the next week and
five reps and reserve the week after
because they're actually training
easier and easier each week relative to
your body's capabilities
and outside of the realm of where best
adaptations are had when your repetition
strength
flatlines and then takes a dip you've
reached your maximum recoverable volume
for that last week
that means adding any more volume or
even staying at that volume is going to
be more and more deleterious to gains
and it's probably not a good idea to
keep going your fatigue is very high
you want to take a de-load decrease all
that fatigue and then come back
and realign everything just like you
started three rir again
lower end of volumes again and then
progress through and that's how training
sort of naturally builds itself now
later in our conversation i asked mike
exactly why he doesn't like to take any
sets to failure early on in a training
phase so what's the downside of just
taking say the last set of each exercise
to failure
even in the first week of a program and
it led to a very informative discussion
if you're going to have failure as
making the biggest difference in your
growth
it's almost certainly true that you
don't need that difference at the
beginning of a motorcycle you just had a
de-load
you just traded in some exercises and
traded in some rep ranges for some
others
the novelty is so great your sensitivity
for growth is so great
almost certainly get great results in
the first week by going shy of failure
you just don't need to go that hard now
could you say the same thing about the
last week
for example if you said now mike
everything
in the last week i ever do i always stop
at one rir i never try to go to true
failure
are there downsides to that that i would
agree with you 100 there are
hypothetical downsides there could be
some magic especially delayed growth
especially in the advanced
that is there between that one and zero
rar so i would say in the last week
if this doesn't come crashing down on
you like a squat or a bench
and if you have a good bench spotter go
all the way to failure is a really
really good idea
to make sure you check all the boxes i
just don't understand why you would do
that in week one
because you're getting great gains
anyway not having to try that hard now
failure training is fun
sweet get up just make sure it's not
poisoning you fatigue wise
uh for the next session you know you
don't want to be in a situation where
you're needlessly cutting your volume
and you're getting a little pings and
dings and getting hurt a little bit much
and you're like man
tell you what i always get hurt on that
stupid failure set
why the hell am i doing it uh then if
you can't justify it i wouldn't do it
then so for mike how hard you should go
mainly depends on where you are in your
program next i spoke with ifbb pro john
meadows and he really emphasized that
how hard you should train
mostly depends on how advanced you are
with the grueling high intensity
techniques he's most known for
being most useful for helping advanced
trainees break through training plateaus
when you start training i think we all
realize that you don't have to kill
yourself
you don't need to take sets to failure
you don't need a crazy high amount of
volume
just by learning proper form you just
continue to get stronger and stronger
you make
nice little incremental increases in
strength but that only take you so far
you know wouldn't it be great if that's
how training was all the time you could
just kind of
add 10 pounds on the bar for the rest
your life and then by the time you're
60 years old you could bench 1200 pounds
but
that's just not how it works so you kind
of move into an intermediate stage
where it's like okay now i i feel most
of these movements pretty good
it's not as easy to get a strong now now
i'm going to add a little bit of volume
i'm going to add a little bit of
intensity
the primary goal with that phase i think
is still
trying to get a little bit stronger
though it's just because you've kind of
went out of that newbie gain phase it
doesn't mean all of a sudden now you
don't care about progressing your lifts
you get to this advanced stage now all
of a sudden you've got to challenge your
body more
so some of those techniques that we like
to use an occasional cluster set an
occasional drop set maybe you you start
putting one of those in a workout
you know going back to our chest example
now maybe get on a machine and now maybe
do a cluster set to finish your day or
maybe do
a drop set to finish your day something
to really challenge the muscle
i i always hesitate in saying this but i
really believe it
so you're probably going to get a lot of
people that get really angry at me for
saying this but
i think that when you hit an advanced
stage i think you could literally use
any exercises you want
in any order you want as long as those
exercises work for you
as long as you just take a certain
amount of them to failure or failure and
beyond
because if you just look at muscle
growth it's mechanical tension
okay if you're using an exercise that
gives you mechanical tension
you're probably going to grow and that's
where you see the advanced guys can
sometimes use those techniques to do
really really well
in particular naturals you know the drug
aided guys have a lot of chemicals that
can help them continue to break through
plateaus but
the natural guys in particular they can
kind of sprinkle some of that stuff
in it's really good for them to continue
to grow
it doesn't really matter what exercise
it is as long as it's one that you feel
working well
and as long as you get good activation
good mechanical tension and exhausting
muscle fibers like if you're doing those
three things
what else are you going to do to make
your muscle grow like that's what muscle
growth is
i mean that's really kind of the crux up
you find an exercise that works well for
you
and you just push it hard john also
emphasized the importance of form
even in advanced stages and that
training harder shouldn't come at the
expense of excessive technique breakdown
and i think it's important to continue
to work on your form you know you get a
guy like you and i
we've been training for a long time but
even we still try to work on our form so
it doesn't mean that you all of a sudden
stop thinking about your form and
things like that now i also wanted to
get a truly elite level athlete's
viewpoint so i spoke with 25 time world
record holding power lifter dr steffy
cohen
and while she also continually
emphasized how important
individualization is
i think more than anyone else she
highlighted that if you want to be the
best
you simply need to learn to push your
limits so
from my own experience what i've seen is
that the best people
in the game like great accomplishments
and great athletes
um come from working obsessively like
you don't achieve
greatness from casual effort you know
never once in my entire career
did i think that i come into the gym
thinking about what's the least i can do
to like get by
from the for the most part and this is
based on what i've observed
people rarely train hard enough and
they're usually in what i call the 50
50 zone where they
don't take themselves to like not
failure but like to an intensity that is
actually challenging ever rarely
and then they don't rest when they're
supposed to rest so it's like you end up
being in this 50
zone where you're always half-passing
all of your workouts because you're not
training hard enough when you when you
should and you're not resting when you
should
we need to push our athletes and
ourselves to improve their confidence
and
really really push for those adaptations
so that they know how to respond to hard
challenges
and this needs to be obviously done in
an intelligent way
steffy also said that while she doesn't
take every set to failure she will run
relatively lighter accumulation phases
training to failure is still a very
central aspect of her programming
training to failure is an integral part
of strength training
that for the most part in most recently
has been underlooked your training
should be
should reflect the specificity of what
you're trying to achieve
so if you're trying to improve your one
rep max squad
you better be trying to train at those
intensities i'm not saying that you're
gonna max out every day
but you should be challenging yourself
almost every training session so that
you can train your nervous system and
your body to respond
to that to to the demands of putting
something that's really really heavy and
having to move it up and down
obviously there you go through
accumulation phases as well so it won't
be fair to just discard completely the
idea of
high volume and low and low intensity i
think there's a time and place for that
but once you've gone through like your
four six or eight weeks of
kind of introductory period of
accumulating some load and
fine fine-tuning your movement once
that's done with
now that's go time like you better spend
four six or eight weeks
really pushing yourself as hard as you
can in those intensity
intensity ranges like get to 90 95 100
in your one two three four five rep max
and really challenge yourself
so you know if your goal is to just just
train for health
forget about everything i just said if
your goal is to see
how strong can you get how big can you
get if you're really trying to test
your limits then you're gonna have to
like put in some effort
and and some intensity stephie also said
that to get the most out of your
training it's important to blend wisdom
from successful athletes
coaches and the scientific literature so
next i got dr eric helms on the line as
someone who did his phd dissertation
on this exact topic this is the i would
say one of the few constants
in hypertrophy training if you are not
registering an rpe of like six or higher
most the time you're probably not going
to be growing very effectively
it has to be reasonably close to failure
uh or reasonably heavy which kind of
forces you close to failure immediately
and then do a lot of sets to
compromise for the fact you're doing low
reps so on a per set basis for
hypertrophy
it should probably be challenging for
your work sets uh
somewhere in the range of like a 5-10
rpe depending on
what your current goal is most the time
we're talking like you know
seven eight nine kind of thing because
in the end we're trying to get a mechano
transduction
right mechanoreceptors in the muscle
need to sense tension for us to start
growing from resistance training
so if a high level of tension needs to
be achieved relative to what our current
tension adaptations are we have to feel
that it has to feel like a high level
attention that can be pushing a low load
set reasonably close to failure
or that can be putting 80 on the bar and
doing
you know it could be triples if you want
if you really want to do seven by three
go for it right you'd probably rather do
like four by six you know
right um i'm gonna put a question to you
now that we've been debating forever not
me and you but just
in the community and you know there's
this idea that you want
to be leaving some reps in the tank
speaking for hypertrophy now
so that you can accumulate more volume
then you have other people saying well
it actually works the other way you need
to go
pretty hard and get close to failure and
it'd be worth it to slash some of those
sets off if you're getting fatigued that
way
is there one that you put above the
other
i think it almost necessarily must be
somewhere between those two extreme
positions
and not just because i'm trying to be
like the political guy who's like you
know the right and the left are both
more i'm so smart
but it's it's more because if we think
about what the actual adaptation we're
trying to get
is it's it's the overlap of those two
positions
right if we ramp up the perfect stimulus
we increase the total amount of recovery
we need and we necessarily either reduce
the frequency
the volume or we have lingering central
fatigue on subsequent days
because of high levels of muscle damage
which create a feedback loop
not allowing us to tap into some of
those high threshold motor units
and we go to the gym and we just can't
turn all the on so
we have to balance those two things how
do we get an effective stimulus when we
train
while stilling a lot allowing us to come
back and put an effective stimulus the
next time
so it almost necessarily has to be in
the middle and there's probably a huge
continuum of what's
equally effective if you do it
intelligently and that's why you can
have people on the more intensity side
of the spectrum or volume side of the
spectrum or
winning winning titles because it
probably doesn't make enough of a
difference to be a limit
to the actual practical outcomes within
a given range of
that continuum and to put all this
together i thought research reviewer
greg knuckles had a really succinct way
of summarizing pretty much everything we
currently know about the
in the trenches coaching stuff and also
the scientific data so i'm gonna let his
summary
round out the video all right so uh if
if i sound robotic
almost as if i'm reading off a script
that's because i am
so it really depends on the lifter the
exercise and what you're hoping to
accomplish and you can look at it
kind of from two different perspectives
both how hard should you push each set
and also kind of how much training
volume should you be doing so i'm going
to start with the former
uh for pure hypertrophy training i think
your best bet is generally to be pretty
close to failure
so for lifts like squats or deadlifts
where form breakdown could cause issues
i think it's worth terminating a set at
the point of technical breakdown
for lifts like rows where you can get
way way more reps if you allow for the
use of momentum i think it's generally
worth terminating a set
uh when you're no longer feeling the
movement in the muscles you're
specifically trying to target so
you know if rose become more biceps and
lower back than lats that's probably
when you want to cut it off
otherwise i think you should generally
be within two
or so reps of concentric failure so
that's for hypertrophy
uh for strength work i think there's
value in doing sets near failure so you
get comfortable grinding but i also
think there's value in doing a bunch of
lower stress sets
uh with three or more reps in reserve in
order to practice skills and perfect
motor patterns and so kind of which
direction you go there
is going to largely depend on the lifter
skill the lift being trained
how far you are from a meet variations
in the individual lifters capacity to
recover from near failure sets
etc and then like i said the other
factor for how hard should you train is
kind of how much volume should you be
doing
um and i'm kind of approaching that on a
per session basis
so i think that depends very heavily on
just the individual lifters tolerance
for volume
but also what type of training they're
doing and their exercise selection
so for example if they're doing those
strength based sets with three plus reps
in reserve
they can probably do way more sets than
if they're doing hypertrophy training
doing say leg press to failure as a
general rule of thumb though i think you
can kind of base this on how you feel
when you're leaving the gym
so i think you should be fatigued but
not completely exhausted after most
workouts
and i also think kind of recovery can
give you some information about whether
you're training hard enough so i think
your muscles
in general kind of painting with a broad
brush should be more or less recovered
within about three days after your
training session so
if your muscles feel totally fresh one
or two days after your training session
you probably should have done more
volume unless you're intentionally
trying to train with very high
frequencies but if you're still
really really sore and fatigued four
days after a workout for the muscles you
just trained
i think that generally indicates that
volume was probably a little bit too
high awesome that was extremely succinct
that that is as succinct as i can get
yeah that was amazing so in making this
video i spent about an hour speaking to
each of these people about how hard you
should train
and because there was so much amazing
info including a lot of stuff that sort
of went off topic
i decided i'm going to upload the full
length conversation with each guest to
my podcast which i'll link down below
that might take me a while to get all of
them edited and uploaded but if you go
