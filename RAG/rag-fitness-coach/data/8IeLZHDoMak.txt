yet again guys this is just another
example of the fact that someone's
subscriber count or even their supposed
credentials are in no way indicative of
the quality of their videos
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and a few days
ago tilo and i were having our usual
morning coffee and we were scrolling
through
the latest youtube fitness videos and we
came across this video by greg
doucette and i'd never heard of this
mike diamonds guy before
so i went ahead and watched through
greg's video and it's a critique of
mike's video
how to lose stubborn fat in one week
four simple science-based steps yes how
to lose fat in one
week and aside from the fact that the
video title is just obvious [ __ ]
and that the content in the video itself
is also pretty bad
there was just something about this dr
mike character that rubbed me the wrong
way i can't explain it exactly
something about him just seemed a bit
off maybe it's partly because the way he
looks and speaks
reminds me of the lead villain from
breaking bad
not sure exactly but it was just a
general gut feeling and so i figured
that i'd go ahead and look a bit further
into his channel and lo and behold
i discovered a few interesting things so
given that mike diamonds does have half
a million subscribers
and a lot of people out there are
watching and are falling for this
content
i figured that this was worth covering
today so i'm going to show you the three
things that i found
and since my goal on this channel is
always to point out misinformation
and then to provide you with actionable
information as well so that you know
what to do in a practical sense to get
the results you're after
i'm also going to go through his other
video um that has almost the exact same
title as the one that greg covered
and this one is called how to lose
stubborn fat in one week four simple
steps and i'll explain why
the claims in that video are also
inaccurate and provide further evidence
that just because someone has the word
doctor in front of their name it doesn't
necessarily mean that they know what
they're talking about
hey dr burke here hey guys dr jim
stopani here hi everyone it's dr sam
robbins
the essential problem is this
before i do that if you are as fed up
with all the misleading information in
the fitness industry as much as i am
and you enjoy these critique style
videos then please just do me one small
favor
and hit that like button below it really
does go a long way in helping to push
the video out there
so that more people can see it and get
access to the proper information that
they need
um i really do appreciate it so as mike
diamonds would say
please gently hit that like button
gently
hit the like button it'd be greatly
appreciated
so i made three pretty bold claims there
in my title
uh bad advice false claims and yes
plagiarism
so let's go over each one and we'll
start here with the false claims
specifically relating to
his video titles now to be fair um as
someone who doesn't just make youtube
content but also consumes it as well
i personally have no issue with people
using uh what you could call provocative
titles on
their videos that's provocative let's
get started
youtube fitness is an extremely
competitive space with thousands of new
videos being uploaded every single day
and most people watching just don't
realize how much effort really goes into
creating this
content so ultimately i have no real
problem with that as
long as the title is accurate and it
actually describes what the video is
about okay if your title is
blatantly misleading and you're just
making straight up false claims
then that is unethical in my opinion and
after digging into mike diamond's
channel
i can confidently say that he has some
of the most ridiculous
most inaccurate titles that i've seen in
all of youtube fitness
how to lose belly fat in one week three
simple steps how to lose belly fat in
one week day one how to lose belly fat
in one week part two
how to lose stubborn fat in one week
four simple steps how to lose stubborn
fat in one week
four simple science-based steps how to
lose chest fat in one week three simple
steps
four steps to lose belly fat in one week
one week belly fat transformation how to
lose chest fat and belly fat in one week
how to lose stubborn belly fat in two
weeks how to get six pack abs in one
week how to get a six pack in three
weeks four simple steps
this guy's basically like the chloe ting
of male youtube fitness hey everyone
except that unlike chloe who at least
admits that her titles are clickbait and
that you can't achieve these sort of
results that quickly
this guy just goes ahead and uses these
insane titles and then just carries on
with the video like everything is normal
without any sort of disclaimer and it
even shows uh before and after
transformations of himself
to imply to the average viewer that this
was done in those very short time frames
sure technically you can lose fat in one
week you can lose fat in one day or one
hour
even one second but obviously when
you're creating titles like this
with a before and after picture the
implication is that you can achieve
very significant results very quickly
and let me know in the comments what you
think about this
are these kind of click-baity titles
okay since technically people are
searching for this kind of information
or is a false claim a false claim
regardless and therefore it shouldn't be
made um i would definitely go
with option number two but let me know
what you think below um i do read all
the comments and i am interested in your
guys feedback
now i assume that the vast majority of
people who are subscribed to my channel
are fully aware that you're not going to
get a six-pack in two weeks
and that you can't make you know
significant abdominal transformations in
as little as seven days and i think
that those kinds of titles set up false
expectations
and they're just a way to take advantage
of people's lack of knowledge so that
you can promote yourself and your
products more effectively
if you're going to use those types of
titles then at the very least
once the video starts you should clarify
what sort of time frames are actually
involved
when it comes to losing fat and building
muscle even if people know
deep down that it's not going to happen
in one to two weeks you're still
implying that it can be done very
quickly so you need to clarify that
otherwise it's very likely that people
will get started but then they're going
to get discouraged when they aren't
getting the kind of results that you
implicitly promised them now the second
issue with dr mike diamonds
is that he blatantly copies other
people's work now i know that plagiarism
is a pretty serious thing to accuse
someone of but hey you look at this and
be the judge so when i was scrolling
through his videos
this particular thumbnail jumped out at
me because another youtuber mario thomas
who i did mention in my recent video
about honest legit youtubers that i do
support
i'm gonna link that up here if you want
to check it out but i remembered
that mario had made a video talking
about the benefits of walking
as an easy way to increase calorie
expenditure and lose body fat and i also
remember that that video had gotten
quite a few views
so i looked it up and put them side by
side and what do you know
the exact same thumbnail different video
title but clearly a blatant rip-off of
mario's
thumbnail design it's not even subtle
and something told me that this probably
wasn't the first time mike had done this
and so i looked into it further and
ended up finding many more examples of
this
so it looks like what mike basically
does is he finds high performing videos
from other youtubers and then he just
copies the title or the thumbnail or
both
to try and replicate the success of that
video for example this video here with
12 million views
10 minute fat burning morning routine do
this every day
and here's mike's version 10 minute fat
burning morning routine do this
every day at home almost the exact same
title
and he also copies the thumbnail layout
as well jeff nippert seven things i wish
i knew when i started lifting 1.8
million views
mike diamond seven things i wish i knew
when i started lifting exact same title
word for word and the same thumbnail
how long will it take to see your six
pack how long will it take to see your
six pack
real body fat percentage examples real
body fat percentage examples even
capitalizes the same words in the title
now i didn't go through all of his
videos um so these are just a few
examples i came across but i'm sure
there probably are more
now to be clear i think it's fine as a
youtube content creator
to find videos that are performing well
and to then roughly model a piece of
content after that most people do that
to some
degree and i'd say that that's just a
smart strategy from an seo perspective
but there's also a fine line between
emulation
and blatant plagiarism and in my book if
you're literally copying someone's video
title
word for word and copying the exact
design of their thumbnail
that is what i would call plagiarism
plagiarism is the representation of
another author's language
thoughts ideas or expressions as one's
own original work
i didn't watch all the videos so i don't
know if he copied any of the actual
video content
but straight up ripping off someone's
exact video title and their thumbnail
is definitely unethical in my opinion so
two strikes for
mr mike diamonds so far he makes blatant
false claims in his video titles
he straight up copies other youtubers
content and now for strike three to
firmly earn this mana place in the
youtube fitness hall of shame
and that's the fact that a lot of this
information isn't accurate either
now i only very recently discovered this
gem of a channel so it's not like i've
watched every single video
but in the ones that i have watched he
does give out several pieces of advice
that are just straight up or wrong
and just like many other fitness experts
out there he cherry picks and
misrepresents research
just to try to support whatever point
he's trying to make now i will give
credit where credit is due
and that's that he does make it clear in
most of his videos that a calorie
deficit is the primary driver of fat
loss
and he does encourage people to consume
foods that they enjoy and that they can
stick to so he's not out here
promoting 24 7 chicken broccoli and
brown rice so i will give him credit for
that but a lot of the other stuff that
i've seen him put out especially in
relation to
fasting and cardio and supplements a lot
of it is just straight up
wrong so greg covered how to lose
stubborn fat in one week
four simple science-based steps and i'm
going to cover how to lose stubborn fat
in one week
four simple steps so the same title but
just without the science-based part so
this should be especially good
how to lose stubborn fat in one week
just no shame whatsoever eh
so he starts off by putting on his
glasses and scrubs and
stands in front of a white board mapping
out how the fat burning process works
to try and make this video seem really
official even though basically
everything he's about to advise
is completely and utterly false so
according to this study there are two
reasons
why fasting is so great for fat loss
because for a certain percentage of
people it helps them regulate their
hunger better
and that helps them stick to their
calorie deficit more consistently
the first one is oxidation rates of free
fatty acids are roughly doubled after
fasting
so look i have absolutely nothing
against intermittent fasting and if you
prefer that style of eating
if it simplifies your diet if it makes
it easier for you to control your hunger
throughout the day then that's totally
fine and you should do it however it
does not have any special fat burning
benefits
when total calories are equated so if
you eat 2 000 calories a day
from meals that are spaced all
throughout the day or you move all 2000
of those calories into a shorter feeding
window
and just eat maybe say two larger meals
there's not going to be any bottom line
difference at the end of the day
yes uh if you don't consume any food for
a prolonged time frame
then during that fasted period you're
obviously going to burn a greater amount
of fat there's nothing at all
surprising or groundbreaking about that
but it ultimately balances out because
during the feeding window
you're going to be eating a higher
percentage of your calories and so
you're going to store
more fat during that time so you can't
just look at fat loss
from this narrow lens and just say oh
you know if you fast then you burn more
fat while you're fasting so fasting is
the key to fat loss okay you have to
zoom out and look at the whole picture
fat loss ultimately comes down
to the total amount of calories you
consume versus the total amount of
calories that you burn
in the big picture so if you do
intermittent fasting then you burn
more fat while you fast and you store
more fat while you eat
whereas if you just have regularly
spaced meals then those fat burning and
fat storing processes
are just more evenly spaced throughout
the day rather than happening in
two bigger spikes but the net effect is
the same at the end of the day
and so you should just choose the method
that you prefer and that you can stick
to the easiest and that's absolutely
critical
because a calorie deficit is irrelevant
if you can't sustain it
the key to losing fat and keeping it off
long term
is to create a calorie deficit and then
to set your diet up in whatever way
allows
you as an individual to maintain that
deficit as consistently as possible and
that's going to vary from person to
person
for some people intermittent fasting
works great and for others
regularly spaced meals are the better
approach whether it's three meals a day
or five meals a day or seven meals a day
not to mention that the study he's using
here
just like in the video greg covered it's
looking at the effects of a 72-hour fast
so you can't just take the findings of
that study and then apply it to a fast
that only lasts for 16 hours
which is what most people who do
intermittent fasting that's the length
of time that they usually fast for
so either mike diamonds doesn't actually
understand how to read studies
or he does know how to read studies but
he's just intentionally being misleading
to support the point that he's trying to
make the second one is that abdominal
subcutaneous blood flow
is increased by 50 which means that
blood flow containing all those
catecholamines
are directly targeted to your
subcutaneous stomach
and that does help with fat loss so once
again
he's using a 72-hour fasting study to
support the effects of doing
16-hour fasts you can't just take the
findings from a fast that was almost
five times the length and then assume
that the same effects apply
on top of that okay abdominal blood flow
was increased but we still don't know if
that actually produced any significant
changes
in abdominal fat loss or if it's just a
very minor non-noticeable effect the
study didn't actually measure that
it's like saying that a testosterone
booster increases test levels by
three percent okay great yeah
technically it does increase
testosterone which sounds good but that
doesn't automatically mean
that it's going to have any real world
benefit since the effect is so
small you can't just take these
statements at face value okay you have
to think critically
you have to question things and look a
little bit deeper to really get to the
truth
a little trick that i've been doing i
train fasted
and it has helped with being able to get
rid of that stubborn fat and this
research here supports that
in the effects of post-absorptive and
postprandial exercise of glucoregulation
and metabolic syndrome
now this test and these results indicate
that post-absorptive exercise
has advantage of promoting fat use so
the exact same logic applies here as
well
yes if you train fasted then you burn a
higher percentage of calories from fat
during the exercise that's not
surprising however a higher number of
calories are being pushed
into a shorter feeding window later on
and so when you do inevitably eat
later on in the day it's going to
balance out because you're going to
store a higher percentage of fat
during that period also keep in mind
that for maximum training performance
and maximum muscle retention
fasted training is not going to be ideal
for most people okay i'm not saying that
you can't do it if you prefer then
that's totally fine but on average
if you want to achieve the very best
body composition results possible
then you are going to be better off to
have a pre-workout meal of some kind
even if it's just a light shake or
something else very basic
anyone can just take a random study and
cherry-pick a few pieces of info from it
to try and prove a given point some
people have built their entire youtube
channel that way
and that's exactly what mike diamond is
doing here and what he does in his other
videos as well and as a doctor
he should know better than this the
third tip that i can offer is doing high
intensity interval training
especially in a fasted state now high
intensity interval training has shown to
elevate levels of catecholamine
which does help mobilize fat and
especially doing that in a fasted state
with all that blood going to your
midsection
it will help you lose that stubborn fat
exact same thing here okay doesn't
matter whether you train faster or not
and it also doesn't matter whether you
do high intensity short duration cardio
or low intensity
longer duration cardio or something in
between um the total number of calories
that gets burned is very similar
so again this is something that i would
recommend that you just choose based on
preference
since the simple fact that you are
consistent with your cardio period
that's going to be by far the most
important thing and if you're out there
trying to grind through a certain form
of cardio that you really hate
it's only going to be a matter of time
before you burn out and quit i can
guarantee
you that some people do enjoy um hit
cardio specifically
because it's so time efficient whereas
other people really hate it because of
just how grueling it can be if you are
doing it properly at those very high
intensities
um in fact you actually need to be even
more careful with hit cardio because it
places your body under more overall
stress
and there's a higher chance of impacting
your weight training recovery from it
if you're doing a lot of hit cardio um
there's more impact on your joints
there's more muscle damage so if we're
talking about true hit cardio where
you're going very hard during the
sessions
then i would suggest that you cap it at
two sessions per week
and no more than three sessions per week

and i'll get back to you in a few days
with a step-by-step plan that you can
follow the link is up here as well as
down below in the description box
and then lastly mike diamonds gives some
supplement recommendations
the first supplement i want to talk
about is your himbine acl
the hinbine comes from an african
evergreen tea
that is called your hymn what your hymn
does it binds to the alpha receptors
and it blocks alpha receptors from being
bound to and that way it promotes more
fat loss
now the research on yohimbine is pretty
mixed some studies have shown positive
results in terms of weight loss
but since yohimbine is a diuretic which
flushes water out of the body
it's hard to know how much of that
weight loss was from actual fat
versus just being from water weight
losses not to mention that in some of
these studies the diet was not
controlled
and there are also several studies that
found no benefits yohimbine can also be
a very stimulating compound
so all in all i would say that unless
you're an advanced lifter
who really knows what they're doing and
you're just trying to edge off a tiny
bit of remaining fat
i personally wouldn't screw around with
this stuff especially if you are
sensitive to stimulants or if you have
any issues with anxiety and then of
course
not surprisingly he recommends my
all-time favorite supplement
branched chain amino acids bcaas branch
chain amino acids
when you're in a fasted state your body
wants to rather go for muscle mass as a
source of energy
but to prevent that and make sure that
it's getting its energy from fat
branch chain amino acids drives your
body protein thin cylinders
and it come again branch chain amino
acids
you know i don't speak spanish in
english please so the truth is that
bcaas are not
anti-catabolic and even if you are doing
fasted training they are not going to
benefit you
to truly get an anti-catabolic effect
you need the full spectrum of essential
amino acids
and not just the bcaas in isolation if
anything
bcaas are actually catabolic because
they stimulate protein synthesis
but then since none of the other amino
acids are present your body breaks
down lean tissue from other areas to
obtain those essential amino acids that
it needs
bcaas are completely worthless as a
supplement and if you're eating enough
total protein throughout the day then
you're already getting all the bcaas
that you need for maximum benefit
if you really want to train on a mostly
empty stomach then either take
an essential amino acid blend or even
better just consume some basic protein
powder
bcaas and eas both still contain
calories
so regardless of which one you use
you're technically not training
completely fasted anyway
and then lastly he promotes a
pre-workout from his sponsor
the next tip i want to give you guys is
rpmax it's a pre-workout so i took a
quick look at this pre-workout
and there's really no point in even
attempting to review it because it uses
a proprietary blend
and what that means is that they list
off all of the ingredients that are
included but they don't tell you the
specific dose for each one and the only
reason supplement companies do this
is so that they can under-dose the
product they can cut costs and they can
make more money from each bottle
proprietary blends have actually become
pretty uncommon at this point
since more and more consumers have
started catching on to it so the fact
that this company is still using a
proprietary blend in 2020
that is a massive red flag and i'd say
that it's reason enough to completely
avoid anything that they're selling
and if you want to check out some
legitimate science-based supplements
using actual research-backed ingredients
in their proper doses that will
genuinely assist your fitness program

diamond's fantastic work
congratulations you're misleading people
with your titles you're copying other
youtubers work and you're giving out
completely inaccurate
information yet again guys this is just
another example of the fact that
someone's
subscriber count or even their supposed
credentials are in no way
indicative of the quality of their
videos what racks up views and
subscribers on youtube
is marketability because the average
person watching these videos
doesn't really know anything they're
still a beginner and so they just
gravitate towards whatever sounds most
convincing okay to someone who has a
good physique
who has good video production value
speaks convincingly and even better
is a doctor but all in all until or
unless this guy decides to clean up his
act
