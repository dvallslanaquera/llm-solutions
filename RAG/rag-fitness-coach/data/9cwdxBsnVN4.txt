ah yeah he's rushing the Ecentric guys
you can tell that it's a a result of
becoming overfocused on a completing the
lift which most of us consider
completing lift as a completion of the
lockout after the concentric phase we
get in there quick and then and then
quick and then uh but that uh on the way
back down that Ecentric phase grows a
lot of muscle and it's good to keep
going and as a matter of fact if you do
this wrong enough you may develop
cobwebs on your elbows which is what
Rich Piana has though I will say if in a
hypothetical World in which I'm single
and a comes into party with a
cobweb tattoo anywhere goth chicks front
of line all other women no need to stay
here anymore goth chicks hello I
mean whatever
