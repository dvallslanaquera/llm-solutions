hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and MSG is bad for you oh
no no wait wait wait that's BS it's
actually not bad for you isn't that
crazy that's it video over see you guys
next time
oh you're still around let's do the
video so first
Google MSG
Zen fee rescue zenfire Esco which is
almost certainly a Romanian person
because that sure should the most
Romanian name I've ever seen
uh actually right over here you will
have the pmid so you can just type that
into well PubMed or Google and you will
get the actual study and the study if I
don't happen to have it on hand well why
would I is
a review of the alleged health hazards
of monosodium glutamate and let me just
read the last line of the abstract it's
the only part I read I'm kidding
critical analyzes of existing literature
establishes that many of the reported
negative health effects of MSG have
little relevance for chronic human
exposure and are poorly informative as
they are based on excessive dosing that
does not meet with levels normally
consumed in food products
that's a scientist way of saying the
evidence that MSG is bad for you is a
very unconvincing
now MSG may have some us as yet
unidentified or poorly understood health
effects unconfirmed health effects but
those health effects are probably very
small as large literature reviews have
not picked them up yet
so we can say with a pretty decent
degree of confidence that MSG is
probably not going to kill you dead in
the middle of your sleep
you're with the lady of the night you're
like oh yeah she's like oh my God Frank
oh MSG uh you you die right on top of
her she's like Frank
and she's like he smells like MSG this
is terrible but delicious and guess what
she has to do this is so bad I shouldn't
say a shit I Scott
she has to eat through your body to get
out
but since you are soaked in MSG
when the medical people get to her at
the end of the night to rescue her
they're like how traumatic was it to eat
through his body to get out and she's
like
honestly was delicious tastes like
Chinese food so MSG is amazing in any
case before we get myself even more
canceled
there are lots of claims by lots of
people
that are active claims that MSG is
definitely harmful
and these claims have just not stood up
to the evidence plain and simple major
government organizations have vetted MSG
as being safe after doing very thorough
reviews I know they're all bought and
paid for by big food or whatever crazy
stuff you'll come up with
studies finding that it's unsafe uh have
nasty design flaws usually and really
like amateurish attempts at research by
clearly ideological people out to get
MSG
and the big thing is this I think a lot
of people think that MSG is bad for you
because they'll say look when I eat MSG
I get really bloated I feel like crap
and it's just I gain a bunch of weight
and I hate it
and you go I gotcha you uh you bought
MSG to flavor your healthy food with and
they're like no who does that so how did
you eat MSG there oh I ate
what was that
I'm sorry come again I age 15 egg rolls
oh
oh and it bloated you
that's so strange
do you have a bad if the tummy feel bad
after 15 fucking egg rolls they're like
well they're so good listen I'm not here
to debate that they're amazing but maybe
it was the 15 egg rolls and not the MSG
content of them that made you feel sick
and unhealthy good God
MSG in moderation for now tentatively
seems like a totally fine choice
further good research could clarify if
it has some degree of marginal negative
what that degree is and how to proceed
but for now don't fall for Scare Tactics
based on
crap data
spread by people that are just real
scared and want a One-Shot solution if
everything's gonna be natural it's going
to be great we got to go back to how we
used to be in the
1820s when people died of dysentery and
cholera
whatever whatever means by that
anyway Arnold Arnold get us out of here
okay
bullshit all right see you next time
hold on download the hypertrophy app
yeah it's good you're gonna get the
bicep pump you make everyday bicep it's
a program generator you can do whatever
you want right and then on the inject
the mic he's still short and this PP is
very small but he's gonna have more
money and he's gonna be able to drive a
Lamborghini around yeah and it's going
to be good yeah you survive now now
be zombies
thank you
