dr james dr mike weekly webinar
answering all of your youtube not
instagram questions
i can't tell which i hate more the
instagram questions or the youtube like
trolls what do you think ah
it's tough so i mean the youtube people
are faceless so it automatically makes
some of the questions more absurd
then again the instagram people are
faceless too sometimes
anytime you're faceless it's always a
bad sign
yeah i don't know lately i've had like a
resurgence of people asking me questions
which is funny because i haven't been
very active on social media for the last
several months
uh and people have been hitting me up
with questions and i've gotten so many
of the like
hey dr james insert thing thoughts
and i have to like pl you know politely
scold people like
thoughts is not a question thoughts is
like you asking me to word vomit and
encyclopedias worth of information on
some topic like what do you want to know
folks if you have a question make sure
it's a specific
question that you've thought about and
formulated thoughts is not a question
all of the thoughts
all right so
i want to start with clearing something
up really quick
so a gentleman named eruption89 oh shit
uh who is he's down there somewhere i
cannot eruption 69
no unfortunately not
oh it's is it on the youtube it is but
it's pretty far down
uh it's right below
the big screen
do you have it pulled up on yours yeah
you want me to okay you screen share
because mine is taking
yeah mine's too slow
all right so people don't have to watch
me painfully scroll through on my dsl
speeds
right so he said you said my question
was misquoting you and that you haven't
said intermediate should be in the five
to ten rep range
but in the beginner intermediate and
advanced hypertrophy training
differences video you said intermediate
should begin to employ some sets
perhaps 20 to 40 percent in the 10 to 20
rep range this came after talking
about how beginner
training should be on the 5 to 10 rep
range that's the majority of
intermediate training 6 to 80 percent
will be in the five to ten range
so you haven't answered why this is in
the video you definitely didn't say
intermediate should train primarily in
the 10 to 20 range
um so that's that's true i i wasn't uh
i did communicate in that video exactly
what i wanted to say
um what ideally i should have said was
because the stages were presented in
transition fashion like that
then you're now you're a beginner then
you're intermediate then you go to
advanced
uh the way i was presenting it was like
when you transition from beginner to
intermediate
you should begin to do 20 to 40 percent
of your volume in the 10 to 20 range and
when we talked about advanced it was
split evenly between all of the ranges
and you notice that in the advanced
there wasn't i don't think a mention
of well now you should really start to
do a lot of the 20 to 30 nor
did it say x percent should now be in
the 10 to 20.
in any case it would be like two things
at the same time and that definitely
didn't occur
uh definitely a failure to communicate
accurately on my part
but to be clear i think that once
beginners transition to intermediates
in that first little while they should
start to thread in 20 to 40 percent of
their volume
in the 10 to 20 rep range towards the
end of their intermediate
years they should be doing most of their
training in the 10
the 5 to 10 and 10 to 20 rep range if i
had to put a number to it maybe like 40
of each and then sort of start to use
the 20 to 30 rep range
when they transition to advanced and
just before they transition to advanced
when they get to advanced
they should already be using all the rep
ranges in
uh through increasingly as advanced
you know yes using all three is advanced
right away but as you get
you know as you build experience as an
advanced lifter
you start to get away from exact
percentages of the range as or ratios
and more into what gives you the best
sfr
so that's the real answer
but that's the deal
yeah so i was kind of in and out on that
one but i think i got the gist of it and
one thing i think is worth
reminding people about is um we use the
terms like
you know novice begin to be in our
intermediate advanced you know our
training ages
it's kind of a rough guideline but
really the problem with training age and
why you would change your training in
this example like with rep ranges or
anything else
is is based on a need not necessarily
like an arbitrary like okay well i've
been training for five years
so now i'm an official intermediate it's
like um
yes that that will work for most people
on average and that's why we use those
denominations
but like the reason why you might start
using the 20 to 30 rep range first of
all is because
you're not getting much out of the 10 to
20 or as much out of the 10 to 20 or 5
to 10 anymore
and or you just can't do that much uh
heavy training anymore and heavy meaning
like
5 to 10 or on the low end of like the 10
to 15 and you find that you start
getting better
pumps my muscle connection you start
seeing progress using something else
and so one of the things to just keep in
mind is we use these as very like vague
guidelines but the problem is
some in this case would be like adaptive
resistance and not getting enough
stimuli anymore not seeing any progress
and that's why sorry my dogs are going
bananas
um that's why you would make a change
like that it's not just an arbitrary
like well
i've been training for you know eight
years now now i need to think about
using 20 to 30 reps it's like you can do
that but you're not really you're just
you're blindly following a general
guideline rather than thinking about why
you would need to make such
a change
all right first actual question i guess
we can count that as a question so that
was question number one
question number two is from hey can you
unscreen share for a sec
i want to see if our screens are the
same
so you have milose's first right and
then looks like
eric then luke then mohammed
okay yeah so
milo made a note i'm just this is out
this is to you milo i know you're
going to be listening to this at some
point about downloading the top comments
for youtube chrome extension
i downloaded it on mine and it didn't
seem to do anything and in one of the
notes in the extension thing it says it
doesn't actually work on youtube itself
only
websites and stuff where it's embedded
on maybe i'm just
too stupid that is a very strong
possibility but i did download it and i
closed out the browser and restarted it
and it didn't seem to make a difference
mike and i were having the same results
that was a little experiment they were
running tonight
so that was it sorry cool no worries did
you want to do the
scrolling or should oh there you go cool
yeah
i got it uh gotta pull it up let's see
we're going to
luke is that who you said we are going
to
luke pastel
all right got it so luke says hi
everybody last
week someone asked about increasing jump
height this is also of interest
to me so i would like to follow up on
this question james mentioned that six
months to a year would be a better time
frame than three months
when true progress is the goal and the
limiting factor is usually strength one
should also be cautious not to exceed
recovery capacity some questions arise
what is a good weekly volume strength
training approximately how many sessions
how many sets per session
so that one we can kind of nip in the
butt early because that's just a total
individualized question there's no i
mean we can give some like very rough
vague ideas but
a good starting place would be to take
what you would do
during your hypertrophy training and i'm
assuming that most of the people who
listen to this are very much
interested in hypertrophy training and
probably have a good baseline on that uh
and then you would take roughly
one half to two-thirds of the volume of
that training
that would be a good jumping off place
uh but again it's individualized mike
and i
like if you strength training for me and
strength training for chad wesley smith
and strength training for
lane norton are all going to be
different things in terms of frequency
volumes the intensities that we can
maintain on average et cetera
so their
questions one two three um
are please take a look at scientific
principles of strength training
ebook because that's just general
strength training stuff
um i i don't know if you saw on the
topic of vertical jump this just
reminded me
remember jace jumps yeah jump guy from
rp plus
i think he's up to like nine foot like
nine inches or some shit right now i
just saw one of his progress videos
that guy could fucking jump oh my god
he's so
close to hitting that dunk dude
that's all so close
apparently he took our advice yeah
so questions one through three we're
gonna punt to the book
we'll take questions four and five
although we should just be taking one
question at a time
number four is it beneficial to include
partial rom exercises like the squat for
example when jumping out of glass to
grasp probably not even 90 degrees
should i let's do squats for a similar
round to get maximally strong in this
relevant range
the strength you're building for jumping
is not
a very high degree of specificity it's
general strength so you're going to use
exercises to build the most general
strength
then by practicing jumping and perhaps
other power moves you're going to
use the ranges of motion that are
relevant to jumping and those power
moves should replicate it
so at the end of the day you can use
partial
lifting and partial squats to build
strength that is a little bit more
specific to jumping
but it might not have a stimulus to
fatigue ratio that is better than doing
full squats
so we recommend mostly doing full squats
and then
the next question of should i spend my
volume only on the most relevant
exercises like power cleans and squats
which isolation exercises like leg curls
and extensions also replaced in the
program
i would say that in a jumping program uh
isolation exercises are like extensions
across
pretty much no place because again their
stimulus to fatigue ratio
one is not great for the purpose of
jumping and second their
transfer to anything or from anything is
terrible
so it's not you know a full squat
stimulus to fatigue ratio for jumping is
not that great either but it's a great
stimulus to fatigue
ratio for general strength development
so you can use that develop general
strength
and then develop more specific jumping
and power movements to
take the general strength and put it
into more specific abilities to jump
high
the problem with light such as lead
curls is they're definitely not specific
to jumping
but they also have a not so amazing
stimulus to fatigue ratio to develop
either hypertrophy that's relevant to
jumping or strength
so we just wouldn't recommend them at
all and a matter of fact if you do them
pretty close
a few weeks close to your jumping they
will teach your nervous system how to be
more slow
and your muscular system as well and
then just be worse james
yeah absolutely agree that was really
good and then just another thing to add
on like
when you're training for jumping
specifically you have to maintain a
higher state of preparedness on average
than you would in a hypertrophy or even
a strength program for example
and so um a lot of people will think
like oh well i did my
my squats and my jumps but i feel like i
still got some gas in the tank maybe
i'll do some leg extensions leg curl
something like that
it's not a bad idea from from the
perspective of wanting to work
hard and feeling like oh i still can do
some more effort
the where it comes where it becomes a
problem is that that extra volume again
as mike said isn't really giving you
anything
and it's adding fatigue even as like
maybe small or seemingly meaningless as
it is
um and that will chip into your
preparedness for the other sessions that
matter throughout the week so
essentially it's junk volume
next up is going to be
python ganem just
below muhammad there got it
he asks how do you program
compound movements for smaller muscles
think close grip bands chin up should i
exchange it for another press that would
otherwise be chest focused or should i
add it directly as supplementary triceps
work
so if you are programming for
hypertrophy
for smaller muscles we're assuming this
is for hypertrophy
then there's really only two things that
are very related you have to think about
one is is the movement that you're using
compound or isolation
and the isolation answer is easy is it
limited by the actual muscle you're
targeting
okay huge because if it's not then it
gives a great stimulus to the muscle as
being limited by it
by no means clear that it gives a good
stimulus at all to the muscles
so for example if the limiting factor
for your closer bench is your chest then
your triceps get a fine
stimulus but when the bar stops moving
it's mostly because your chest gave out
and your triceps might independently be
like three or four away from failure and
get almost done
so that's problem number one problem
number two is what is the stimulus to
fatigue ratio
is you getting a really good target a
really good hit really good pump burn
tension
etc um in the target muscle
and is it beating up your joints
excessively or really really hard and
causing a lot of systemic fatigue spill
over
so we'll just give you two examples and
one on the other end if you're close
grip bench you're ostensibly doing it
for triceps
it pumps your pecs up like crazy it
bothers the fuck out of your shoulder
joints in your wrists
and it doesn't really hit your triceps
much and it leaves you really tired
don't fucking do it for triceps that is
me
right there you go safe verbatim yeah
and then uh
if you close your bench or something
that is limited by your triceps fucks
them in the ass completely
it's super awesome on your joints then
you're absolutely good to go to use it
so there's really not a whole lot of
dogma compound versus isolation you do
what works same thing for
close grip underhand chin ups if it's
really a bicep exercise you will know
uh based on the limiting factor and the
stimulus to fatigue which are very
related because if the muscle is not a
limiting factor stimulus fatigue ratio
for that muscle is going to be really
really awful there are ways to use
compound movements
that normally don't have good signal
fatigue ratios uh to make them better
and that's by pre-exhaust so you can do
skull crushers pretty exhausted triceps
and then do close grip bench
and maybe that will have a better sense
of fatigue ratio for your triceps but
that's something you've got to just feel
out by yourself but remember don't feel
compelled to have to use compounds
if isolations are taking good care of
you you're good to go can compounds be
effective sure and then you can really
try using them
but make sure they are limited by the
muscle you're targeting
and there's a good stimulus fatigue
ratio compared to other muscles so if
someone's like
you got to do dips to grow dips just
have a shitty stimulus disintegration of
the limited by your front delts and
you're not trying to train your front
delts
why the fuck would you do dips i just
wouldn't do it maybe try to change the
technique but if that doesn't work just
stop the exercise
at the end of the day if you have a good
series of exercises that gives you a
great stimulus to figure ratio they
are limited by the target muscle then
you're in a really good spot
james yeah that's a great answer and i
think
we talked about this maybe a few weeks
ago but i think like the old school
sporting mindset is hard for a lot of
people to break where we say
like do the compounds first they're the
most important
and it's not a bad recommendation but
bodybuilding and you know just
hypertrophy training in general is much
more
forgiving in terms of exercise selection
so long as it meets the criteria of
stimulus to fatigue ratio stuff
right and so in that case like you don't
necessarily have to
bench to get a huge chest or you don't
necessarily like mike said you don't
necessarily have to
do dips to get huge triceps there's lots
of other options it really depends on
how you respond
your technique and your ability even
just your conscientiousness in that
movement
to make it very stimulative for yourself
some are just better than others for
some people and that's perfectly okay so
you don't have to think like
well i'm training arms so i need to do
like compound stuff for my arms
you don't have to you don't have to
yep very very good at besides
oh i got a screech here all right
you know here we go oh
ole r
questions about muscle twitching i get
there i think he said these mini
contractions are twitching my left
tricep throughout the day currently weak
through them as our performance is still
solid i'm not doing that in a reasonable
amount of volume and intensity
is there cause for concern when getting
muscle switching or should i just chug
along
honestly ollie i didn't want to be the
person that tells you this
but you're probably going to die and
it's going to be bad it's going to be a
closed casket funeral your tricep is
actually now
a proto atom bomb that will soon explode
killing not just you but your family but
in all reality
sometimes twitches happen for no good
reason at all even you don't train a
muscle they'll just start doing it
given out again my eye lids will twitch
and then they'll stop twitching
twitching that occurs right after and
within several hours after the muscle
has been used extensively
are a symptom of what we call
perturbation that something happened to
the muscle that was really disruptive to
it
and they're a good sign that you did a
good job so for example if you ask
yourself did i train my chest hard
enough
and your chest is like twitching on you
every now and again like pretty
intensely after a workout that slowly
recedes after five or six hours you
probably are gonna get really sore you
probably did enough
okay if someone said i don't think i'm
training hard enough but after every
time i train my heart muscles i get
these twitches for a few hours
be like dude you're probably good but if
you don't get the twitches it's not
cause for concern
and if you get random twitches
throughout the week it usually just
doesn't mean a goddamn thing i've had
them all the time through muscles like
if it correlates to anything they're not
related to anything seemingly and not so
james yeah the only time it's it's it's
really noteworthy is when you are having
like functional overreaching symptoms
and you're having like
painful spasming like when you're trying
to take a shower or something and
your biceps are like it hurts like fuck
um that's one where you're like okay i'm
probably pretty overreached i might
you know maybe not go quite as hard next
time um but for the most part no this
spasm it's not a big deal uh somebody
made some funny comments below i get it
in my uh my big toe actually i'll start
getting like
the like medio lateral twitching which
feels really weird but if i just sit
still
toe will be like i'm like oh what is
happening gross
but like mike said it's usually not a
huge deal oh yeah this guy here we go
jung piss pig that's quite a name
uh wow people funny names
down below
all right baby yeah
let's scroll down to stephen ma
he's right below the super orange k of
clausosaurus
got it man ma
steven that man steven ma
says what progression method would i use
if i wanted to get stronger on the big
three lifts
but not necessarily for the purpose of
power lifting especially if i wanted to
train the big three lifts multiple times
a week without generating too much
fatigue well actually there's a good
answer for me
so if you want to get a power lifting
you at least occasionally have to make
sure that you do a peeking phase which
is sets of one to three that does
fatigue you a little bit it does beat up
your joints a little bit
because you don't ever want to compete
or for the time being you don't want to
compete
we would have our best advice would be
to cycle derivatives of the compound
lifts themselves with a big three
in the five to ten rep range front
squats leg presses hack squats some high
bar squatting
close grip benches migrant benches so on
and so forth deficit deadlifts
definitely get deadlifts
do those for multiple months five to ten
rep range to get bigger
and then do a couple multiple months
into three to six rep range
in the actual competition lifts or very
close derivatives uh to get
basically stronger to add basic strength
and then just repeat that with some
active rest phases every now and again
indefinitely and you're going to add
tons of
size and tons of strength and the basic
strength in the lifts and if you ever
want to test your maxes you'll have to
do a peeking phase or two to get it
right and that would be sets up one to
three reps
yeah that was really good uh definitely
check out scientific principles of
strength training i mean that book
covers that topic pretty pretty uh
holistically
um the other thing is just keep in mind
like you might not be able to do the
competition lists
multiple times per week it might just be
a one time per week kind of thing for
most of them which is fine uh no no
shame there
especially something like competition
deadlifts like unless you're like you
know
105 pounds like that's just not going to
happen a couple times per week uh
so uh just keep that in mind
all right some dude norris
up a little bit oh down a bit oh
multiple comments
oh got it
we'll be training first thing in the
morning during my next meso
my pre-workout meal will be some skim
milk with whey protein and a carb powder
my question is what is the practical
difference between a carb source like
maltodextrin or just some
sugar aka nesquik ps i'll be training
twice per day on two of my six days
so the first thing is i don't know if
nesquik just has regular sugar i'm not
sure what's in there might be high
fructose corn syrup which behaves a
little differently to the table sugar
secondly the practical difference would
be probably nothing
short of digestive and energy
differences so what you want to do is
try both and see if you notice anything
as far as the digestive comfort
differences
and do you have a little bit more energy
with one or the other because like the
nest click might take a little bit
longer digest multiduction is really
rapidly digesting
so if you take that you might still feel
a little bloated in the gym and then not
so energetic
if you take them all the next turn you
might get tons of energy and not only
bloat on the other hand depending on how
much
time there is between your pre-workout
and because you're going to say first
thing in the morning but you should
probably drive to the gym
hypothetically maybe and then maybe if
it's like uh
you know skim milk whey protein and
maltodextrin together
unbelievably glycemic highly insulin
urgent
shake so you might actually go
hypoglycemic after drinking that shit if
you wait more than like 15 or 20 minutes
to start training and if that's the case
that's no good so you might want to
switch to the next book so
experiment and see which one works best
for you
yeah our our graduate advisor when mike
and i were in school was really big on
you
who and he'd always be like athletes
need to drink yoo-hoo and mike and aaron
everybody would just kind of look at
each other like why does he have such a
fucking boner for this yoo-hoo shit
and then mike after like years of
punishment about the you who
finally was like why do you want us to
have the you who's like it has
liquids carbs and proteins and mike was
like it has about as much protein as an
apple he was like
what no he no
he said no well yeah it's got some
protein in there
it's got some and i was like yeah
technically it has some
yeah that was funny we were all like on
a like mandatory you who
you who recommendation for a while
amazeballs
i'm maddie mad dog forberg and for those
of you who don't know me i am a strength
coach and a 57 kilogram power lifter on
team usa
[Music]
i like that i can program into the rp
diet app what time i'll be training
and even if it's a light heavy moderate
kind of session and that will
you know differentiate the kind of
macros that i'll need and it can let me
put in how long my training session is
going to be
i use the rp diet app during all seasons
of power lifting whether i'm cutting
weight
bulking up or even right now maintenance
keeping on the same weight that i am
all right um scrolling down here
pretty far below the actually below the
orange of matt
cocker we have our own buddy montes
pelepuchus
from the great nation of lithuania all
right got it
so he says he's got three questions
which is down from his usual five
hundred
so we'll
[Laughter]
says when cutting would it be best to
try to retain as much water weight as
possible to maintain strength
no water weight does not have a
one-to-one relationship with strength
that has an optimality curve
which is usually results eu hydration
not hyper hydration is best for strength
if you're bloated you get weird body you
can
weird like um blood pressure issues and
almost pass out with heavy weights or
your leverages will be off you just
don't feel your best
so not as much water as possible uh
but uh a good amount uh so you don't
want to like cut all your salts out or
something
the reason people bloated a lot back in
the day to maintain
the most strength is because they were
trying to fill out their power lifting
equipment and get as tight as
possible that's really the only reason
nowadays strength athletes don't do that
yeah that seems silly uh there's really
no incentive to do that at all and
probably disincentives from a health
perspective of like just doing
things unnecessarily to retain water
number two during your cutting phase is
it generally better
to only drop calorie intake and apply
hunger managers strategies but not
increase cardiovascular activity to
avoid transition
intermediate to slow twitch muscle we
have answered this question
like 400 times so just a real
super brief answer uh if you're a
strength athlete you probably shouldn't
be doing any cardio
if you're a hypertrophy person then you
can do as much cardio as
is best for your stimulus so for your
diet fatigue
you ask you ask yourself the question
next week i need another 500 calorie
deficit
am i going to get more fatigued can i
get out of food or am i going to get
more fatigued
adding it to cardio and whatever honest
answer that is what you should do
um and then mata spina bucha said should
plyometric performance increase faster
when massing or
cutting probably neither because the
weight gain
offsets your ability
yeah oh it's a funny question
uh you probably see a rapid initial
increase just from the calorie increase
but then once your weight gain started
going up then it would kind of like
peter off a little bit the other problem
is that you probably shouldn't be doing
plyometrics during a weight gaining
phase anyway it's just not a productive
way of hypertrophy training yeah
and uh for cutting you would see
an initial drop from lower energy levels
and a permanent reduction in plyometric
ability
from fiber conversion but also your
absolute performance would start to be
not as bad or potentially a little
better
because you would lose so much weight
that you would be more bouncy
so ideally this is why we most power
athletes and
athletes that use a lot of plyometric
rebound in their sport and their
training
are we advised to spend the maximum
amount of time in maintenance uh we're
neither massing nor cutting these
effects
and if you do do a lot if you end up
having to do body composition stuff then
you need
a transitional period where you are now
recalibrating kind of your specific
preparatory sport stuff
at your new body weight body composition
classic example was like if you gain
20 pounds on your mass and you have to
like sprint for soccer
sprinting 20 pounds heavier is going to
be a lot different and you need time to
adjust and losing 20 pounds same thing
all right let's scroll down right below
the big
orange l of lewis thornton and look at
majid mukhol got it
straight out of the mummy returns all
right he says hi doctors thanks a lot
for the weekly webinars
the rear side delt direct sets counting
and the rear side valves rpi pertrib
page it says there are a lot of overlap
between side delts and rear valves
exercises so i'm not sure how to count
direct sets
for example there's one set of upright
row face pull thumbs down lateral raise
counters one direct set for rear delts
and one direct side side belts
also what about the traps i feel i'm
just certain degree and upright rows for
example
but doesn't count as a direct result so
[Music]
i wonder i think i answered this in a
youtube video once but in any case
you can count it however you like as
long as you're doing two things one
uh honoring the stimulus so if something
really stimulates a muscle count it
uh and two uh consistency count it the
same way you always do so if you count
rear delt flies
or you know upright rows for rear
outside delts uh then
keep doing that if you kind of have to
one half of the other keep doing that at
the end of the day the consistency thing
makes a lot of sense so yeah
and the reason why it makes sense too is
because ultimately you're trying to
train those things roughly from
mev to mrv throughout the mesocycle so
it kind of
self corrects so long as that you
measure them consistently as mike said
so for example
if you are doing a lot of upright rows
and
you find that um the next time you try
and do
like either like a face pull or like a
reverse fly kind of movement that you're
constantly like under recovered then you
might decide that okay for upright rows
i'm going to count one
each because it clearly is affecting my
performance on the isolation movement
where there's no question
it's being interfered with and stuff
like that if you're like me and you can
just do
indefinite amounts of all of them then
just treat them as their own things and
don't worry about the overlap or
fractional sets and just
just work on getting that muscle you
know to its mrv through whatever means
that you find best
if this is one of those like needless
sorry uh we'll let it go it's just this
this is one of those things where i
would say i
mike and i put made up the nomenclature
for the volume landmarks right so with
all the people who appreciate the idea
it's
us but at the same time this is one of
those things that like i wouldn't
fuss over too much and this is coming
from one half of the crew who made the
volume landmarks right so
don't fuss over this too much this is
one of those like you're just
spending too much time doing math not
enough time just like looking at
performance
listening to how your body feels you
know going forward with that this is
don't overthink it is my point
[Music]
all right um number two
uh question from majid is exercise
ordering on legs day for example i do
squats then rdl is not like pressed on
microsd and lunges
that is between muscle groups right
and not uh do them all one after another
so i can let the muscle rest a little
bit and perform maybe better
what do you think about this should all
muscle group exercise be done
one after another alternated what about
smaller muscles on chest i do triceps
calves triceps
and in back day i do biceps marble shrug
biceps
uh i think this is not the best idea
and this will be explained extensively
in uh upcoming book
coming up in about december for
scientific principles of hypertrophy
training
there is a local fatigue versus systemic
fatigue ratio in
any work that you do local fatigue
is hypertrophic systemic fatigue is not
so
if you do all of the muscle groups
clustered together
let's say tri-substructure triceps you
can get
a very good ratio of local fatigue high
to systemic fatigue relatively low in
all of the exercises
on the other hand if you do triceps
biceps triceps biceps triceps instead of
triceps your triceps
the last exercise of triceps you are
like
five exercises in versus three and
you have a decent amount of local
fatigue although you have way more human
triceps back to back-to-back
but your systemic fatigue is pretty high
so now the stimulus-to-fatigue ratio of
that last exercise of triceps that
you're doing is not nearly as high as it
would have been
if you just sandwich it into the triceps
that's our current thinking on the
matter and there are some exceptions to
that in some regards
but i think on average it's probably
better to once you start training a
muscle
to just finish the job and then move on
to the other muscle it also allows you
to do prioritization whether it's daily
or weekly or whatever
so for example one workout you have
mostly chest triceps at the end
and then another workout you have mostly
triceps chest at the end that allows you
to give a really really definitive
stimulus
in one workout and a little bit of a
less fatiguing situation
in the other workout and that sort of
complements itself
so that's how we would normally do it
you'll also realize that if you train
splitting muscles up a lot um you end up
getting not as sore from the same volume
and i don't think that's a good thing i
think that's a not great thing
because i think your local muscles
aren't being pushed as hard as they
could be
because when you're splitting them up
you're making yourself more tired with
unrelated muscles
ends up being you can't summate as much
local fatigue because the systemic
fatigue is now more the limiting factor
um and local fatigue is a bad thing in
the sense that it stops you from
performing but this is a good thing
because it is hypertrophic systemic
fatigue is not hypertrophic
um that's that's the best way i can uh
sort of describe it
almost like i guess maybe like here's a
stupid analogy if you like
really wanted to enjoy the fuck out of a
food like enjoy it the most
when would you eat it in a meal first
and you would finish all of it enjoy
living fuck out of it
you wouldn't like eat some of the food
and then switch to a more boring bland
food and then come back to that food so
when you come back to it
you're already more full and you're kind
of like yes what's good but i'm like
really full
you want to eat that food when you're
like ready and going once you start
finish it so maybe that's a stupid
analogy you could use but that's the
idea
i think i think it worked just fine uh i
i was going to go the prioritization
route but you beat me to that so
kudos on that one and the other thing
kind of tying into the idea of systemic
fatigue is also it makes your warm-ups
more
laborious as well so once you're warmed
up on a muscle group you can mostly just
keep
going and finish out that muscle group
until you're done
i don't know about i was reading like
that one like if i did
uh like rdl's and then
uh had to do leg press and then had to
come back to something else hamstring
i'm not going to go right into that
first set i'm probably going to have to
do at least one like feeler warm-up set
and that's just
a lot more systemic fatigue yeah yeah
exactly all right
charles austin second to last there
got it and this will be our second to
last questions
what we're going to scroll up um for he
asks why is maintenance phase only
recommended when transitioning from a
bulk to a cut and not a cut to a bulk
shouldn't we give the body a chance to
create a new body fat percent set point
at the end of a cup before massing
and wouldn't the maintenance phase help
reduce the accumulated fatigue from the
weight loss phase
so the ultimate answer to this question
comes in the form of a mini cup manual
that um that we wrote and that's um it
actually shows all the phases and all
the justifications
but there's a couple of reasons why
cutting can lead to a bulk right after a
couple situations
one if you're cutting to be very very
lean and be contest ready
you can't actually maintain it that body
fat that would be a disaster
so you have to do a mass phase right
after by definition
so there you go um and then
if you had a shorter cutting phase
to just get leaner and potentiate for
that you can absolutely go right into a
masking phase without a ton of fatigue
no problem because you probably just
didn't generate a lot of fatigue
now for that middle ground where the
diet phase was pretty long
uh but you didn't get super lean maybe
went down to like ten percent from
you know seventeen uh afterwards yeah
you probably do want a maintenance phase
and uh then you can start a masking
phase after
the thing is after a bulking phase or a
massive phase
almost always you want to do some sort
of maintenance phase
but after a cut before a bulk you don't
always have to do a maintenance phase
and a lot of times you don't
so that's the more complicated answer
which is why we recommend
a maintenance phase not only when
transitioning from bulk to a cut
but that's when we recommend it for sure
and then
we don't necessarily say it's a bad idea
after a cut before a bulk but you got to
have some justification for it and there
are distinct circumstances like your cut
was really short and you're ready to
mask again where you don't have to do it
or you got super low body fat and it's a
really stupid idea to do it
i had a discussion once with folks that
were i think like like uh
lyle was saying or somebody was saying
like uh
it was a natty bodybuilding thing where
like you don't grow any muscle right
after you're
that lean so doing a mass phase
is fucking stupid right after you do a
contest phase because
you're not lean or sorry you're so lean
that you're gonna you need to
re-establish testosterone levels all
this stuff
and you have to like it's pointless due
to massing phase and then i uh i was
just fucking with people at this point
intellectual bullying i was like okay i
gotcha so what's the solution
to they're like you have to do a
maintenance phase and so what's the
solution
to fixing the hormones they're like you
have to get unleaned you have to
intentionally gain fat to get better
hormones like uh
and how would you gain fat would it be
through a maintenance phase and they
were like
crickets i'm like fucking idiots that's
a fucking mass face
that's how you get fat you don't get fat
maintaining like literally by definition
you would just like
stay and super lean and be miserable
continuously
so it's one of those things where like
that's just an example after pre-contest
you want a massive phase and not all
muscle gains are directly happen when
they happen
a lot of it's a delayed building of
structures and stuff so you can
absolutely have a really productive
massive phase
right after although after that shortly
you will have
absolutely once you get back to
reasonable body fat it is absolutely a
real good idea to make take a
maintenance phase before you continue on
passing
one hours
yeah and there might be like
psychological incentives too which might
kind of touched on already but you might
finish your cut and be kind of at that
like burnout point where you're like man
i can't
think about going back to the gym right
now i'm so fucking sick and tired of
this bullshit
and i got clients who do that i don't
say all the time but it's not unusual
where i'm like you ready to mass and
they're like
fuck you that's what i think and you're
like great
maintenance phase let's just let's chill
out uh you'll have you know a couple
weeks to recover and then we
yeah you can just think about what you
want to do then afterwards and
sometimes that's the the course that we
take where they they might do like
a 15 week like three mezzo cut and by
that but you know that's long and so
if they do that by the end of that
you're like all right you ready to start
doing that five to ten hypertrophy
training they're like
no fucking way and i've had plenty of
clients where we took a brief
maintenance phase
and then went into massing afterwards
just to alleviate the stressors that
they had going on so that's
another reason why you might find
yourself there
all right so we skipped this gentleman
but we had enough room at the bottom for
his
uh number of likes he got his question
was good enough so we're james we're
going to scroll all the way back up just
just below luke
postel our first question asker and it's
going to be a big giant orange
muhammad
[Music]
settling range do you think it's
possible to lower one's body fat
settling range from around 20
all the way to 10 especially for someone
who grew up being slightly overweight
if so uh who can this uh how can this be
done thank you guys
keep up the good work thanks so much
mohammed um
my opinion give it so there's like not a
ton of direct literature on this we have
to use a ton of different
sources of insight including a lot of
personal experience coaching and
watching people try to do this kind of
stuff
you can i think you can change your body
fat settling range um
at a at a decent level and i think
based on if you alter your activity and
eating style permanently
this isn't anything like physiological
level alter but a realistic level it
does like there's no guarantee it's
going to keep doing
that if you go back to eating a piece of
shit which a true settling point would
be
but if you continue to be active and
healthy there's no reason you can keep
your body
fat low however that being said if you
start at 20
that's just kind of where you live your
life 10
is is a pretty big dream but it might
happen
but i would say like you can reset to 15
12 to 15
would be really really reasonable uh
settling at 10
maybe in some cases i just wouldn't bet
on that
settling at 10 i'll tell you exactly
what has to happen you have to make
forays
into like the six to seven percent zone
a few times
and have a really successful uh
renorming
phases after where you sort of bulk out
of that to 10
and try to hold it a couple of times
later
that might be a reality but it's tough
because going to six or seven percent is
real tough the the real answer here is
whatever you want to be
stable at you have had to cut
significantly below it
not to it in most cases and and and
that's tough
so uh and it's just not in the cards for
everyone genetically so i would say
can you go from 20 to 10 maybe maybe
definitely maybe but it'll be tough can
you go from 20
to 15 and with really good lifestyle
permanent lifestyle changes
uh so at an anatomical level at least
not maybe not hormonal
you do display roughly 12 body fat yeah
it's totally possible
james
yeah i in i'm trying to like tiptoe
around this a little bit so apologies if
i'm fumbling with my words but
i think a lot of people often and i
don't know if this is your situation
uh muhammad but i think a lot of people
who are maybe overweight
think that okay if i could just get to
like in this case you know
if i could just change my body so i
could just be at ten percent body fat
all the time it's gonna make me happy
make me feel better
and maybe that's true but that you might
be under
underselling how much effort and
suffering it's going to take to get
there so dr mike already said
you know to really be able to hang on to
that level you're going to have to get
below that level a few times
and the thing is like getting to 10 like
just in this example getting yourself to
the point where you could hang out at 10
might mean that the rest of your life
sucks ass because you're constantly
starving constantly struggling
constantly fatigue constantly irritable
because of all this bullshit that you
have to do because your natural
tendency is to be a little bit heavier
that's not to say that it's impossible
but also just consider that like
although it sounds like oh it's just 10
body fat how bad could that be
it's gonna be fucking terrible it's
going to be you having to fight
against out everything in your body all
of your cells saying i would rather be
up here right now and you're going to
have to try and bring it down
over years and i'm just telling you
don't put too much stock into that
because
getting there might just make you
miserable and you might have just lived
a much happier
compromised life at you know maybe 15 17
where you look better you feel better
but you can still have a social life you
can still go out to eat and you don't
have to fucking
weigh everything that you eat for the
rest of your life so just keep that in
mind just i'm not saying that you're
wrong i'm not saying i'm right or
there's probably some gray area in
between but that much of a change is
going to require
a level of suffering that you might not
be prepared to maintain for the rest of
your life
yeah yeah that's really good insight so
try try go down to a lower body fat yeah
try for a bit come up to a slightly
higher one
stay there rebound back try again and
over
some course of time it'll probably get
much easier
and then maybe let's say you're at 10 it
never really gets much easier
but you float up to 12 and you're super
stable and everything's great
and there you go twelve percent like
that would be really gnarly so it
definitely can shift
it's just uh ten to twenty percent or
twenty ten percent it's not a few months
kind of thing it's a few years kind of
thing
and it might be out of reach for a lot
of people not to say like if you start
at 40
you can live life at 20 or even 15 years
later no problem
but not a ton of people can hold an
average of 10 in general the 10 is
very lean right uh you know most the
average male young male who's healthy
uh and not over fat has a body fat at 15
right so already like 10
is better than the average and if you
were sort of pudgier genetically or
through environmental influences and you
have a more
higher number of fat cells just getting
to 15 and staying there would be like
fucking sweet
right getting to 12 would be amazing
getting to 10 would be really really
really impressive
and potentially very capable of doing it
just have a little bit of reverence for
it it's kind of like a real
serious thing not just like um there's
this tendency and i'm absolutely not
um i'm not uh
i'm not accusing you of anything i think
you're probably in a very good head
space about this but there's a tendency
to get into a head space
but a lot of the internet shit
especially um
is like oh i'm gonna do these things and
get these results and then have them
forever and it'll be like easy
like you know this is the way the
intermittent fasting crowd talks like
yeah just stop eating
and you'll be super lean and you'll get
to have all these great things and bang
hot girls
and this shit's not easy as fuck at all
getting to a temporary place is not so
hard getting to a permanent place for
sustainability is fucking brutal
so just just know you're getting
yourself into some work
absolutely that's it that's all i got
jmo and i think we're done that's 10.
oh man that one flew by
i felt like yeah i felt like that one
flew by
okay yeah i guess we got everything all
right well folks thanks for sending in

really good questions this week as like
we usually do so we appreciate you
engaging with us make sure you subscribe
