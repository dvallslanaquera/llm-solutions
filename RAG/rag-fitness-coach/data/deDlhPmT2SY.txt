okay i'd like you to take a look at this
set
and try to answer the question is he
training hard enough to maximize
muscle growth let's just skip ahead to
the last two reps here
one way and flexibly come up
damn yeah
[Music]
[Applause]
all right i hope that's an easy one
right there might be a few masochists
who'd argue he could have grinded
another rep
but i think most people would easily
agree that ed corny squeezed every last
drop of gains
out of that set but what about this set
this one's a bit trickier
is j training hard enough to maximize
growth here now for a bit of context i
measured how long it took him to
complete the positive or concentric
phase of each rep
the first rep took him 0.57 seconds to
complete and that stays pretty steady
throughout the set
and then you'll notice that as he gets
to these last couple of reps here
they take 0.7 seconds and then 1.03
seconds
to complete so was that set to failure
could he have gone harder should he have
gone harder
well let's start with what the science
has to say about that first question
according to this paper from fischer and
steele muscular failure
is when despite the greatest effort a
person is
unable to meet and overcome the demands
of the exercise
causing an involuntary set end point so
basically you don't just stop because it
feels hard
you stop when your muscles are
physically incapable of producing enough
force to move the weight
now practically speaking coaches tend to
break this up into two categories
there's absolute failure which is when
you just can't move the weight
even if you change your form or get
other muscles involved
and there's technical failure which is
when you can't do another rep
with the same form so once your form is
altered
that would be failure now most coaches
tend to prefer the technical failure
definition
because it just feels wrong to define
failure as going
all out at any cost even if you break
technique
but there's a problem with this
technical definition too the reality is
that as you push toward failure
especially on free weight exercises your
form will change to some degree
so if we allow zero technique breakdown
we risk terminating the set
well before the target muscle has
reached its full force generating
potential
oh what a loser so i personally like to
define failure somewhere in the middle
a little form deviation is okay if it
helps you crank out those extra few reps
to really reach muscular failure
but once you start creating a whole new
exercise just to move the weight
you're stretching the definition of
failure too far also since it's easier
to keep form consistent on most machines
i don't think we should tolerate as much
if any form deviation there
now some researchers have started to
investigate failure in terms of rep
speed
slowdown basically as you get closer to
failure the concentric will move more
slowly as you grind out those last few
reps
for example this 2019 study found that
on the bench press exercise
once subjects got halfway through the
set the reps had already slowed down
by 30 and then on the last possible rep
the weight was moving about 80 percent
slower now it's important to note that
how much rep slowdown you see
as you approach failure is highly
individual and will be different for
different exercises
still if the reps don't slow down at all
you're most likely not at failure yet
at least not using my definition and if
the reps have started to slow noticeably
you could be getting at least somewhat
close so coming back to jay
no i definitely don't think this set was
to failure i think he could have done at
least two or three more reps but still
good enough for him
so yeah he definitely could have gone
harder but does that mean he
should have gone harder well before we
try to answer that question
it's important to cover a bit of
scientific background and a few more
examples from in the trenches
so as far as i can tell there are two
main approaches people take to figure
out if they're pushing hard enough
and they both have some science base the
first is the simplest approach
you just go all the way to failure every
time or at least
most of the time this way you simply
don't need to worry about accidentally
undershooting your effort
now a lot of people in our science-based
niche are quick to call this overzealous
meathead training
but i think it's actually fairly
reasonable in some contexts and it does
have some science base
i mean you can find peer-reviewed
literature suggesting that people should
train to the highest intensity of effort
thus recruiting as many motor units and
muscle fibers as possible
however this recommendation is always
couched within a low volume
single set to failure paradigm so i
think this every set to failure approach
is a viable option for people who are
very limited on time
and want to get in an efficient training
stimulus for the lowest possible time
investment
however i'm confident this style of
training isn't optimal
especially over the long term and that's
because you're forced to keep weekly
volume
or the number of sets you do very low
when taking a lot of sets to failure
and we also know from a pretty large
body of science that on average
more volume leads to more muscle growth
at least up to a point
this is a figure from a meta-analysis
led by james krieger where you can see
that of the 15 studies included
11 are to the right of the center line
meaning those studies favored higher
volumes
if there was truly no impact of volume
on muscle growth you'd expect to see
more studies like this one to the left
and there'd be a much more random
distribution around the center
but that's not the case the overall
average effect clearly favors higher
volume
now to make this more tangible when you
break it down in terms of the number of
sets per muscle per week
it's clear that doing at least 10 sets
per muscle per week is better than doing
five to nine sets
or doing less than five sets now i can
already hear a bodybuilder somewhere
saying
but jeff the muscle only knows failure
but we know this isn't true
a brand new systematic review and meta
analysis from gergich and colleagues
which pulled the results of 15 studies
and about 400 participants
found that similar increases in muscle
size can be attained regardless of
whether or not training is carried out
to muscle failure we also know from
other research that those
final two reps before failure are
disproportionately more fatiguing
which is not good from a recovery
standpoint now obviously this does
depend on the exercise
failure on a set of lateral raises isn't
nearly as fatiguing as failure on a set
of deadlifts
but on a per set basis going all the way
to failure
is clearly harder to recover from so if
we can get the same hypertrophic
stimulus with less recovery demand
and can do more weekly volume by not
going to failure
the solution is simple we need to find a
way of quantifying
how hard we're training without needing
to take every set to failure
and that brings me to the second and in
my opinion more optimal approach to this
question
which is getting really good at using
rpe and
rir now before i show you some real life
examples give me 30 seconds
on the beach to explain these concepts
for those who don't know
so rpe stands for rating of perceived
exertion and it just ranks how hard your
set was
on a scale of one to ten rir stands for
reps in reserve
so it's how many reps you left in the
tank so if you had an rp of 10
that means you reached failure you had
zero reps in reserve
if you had an rp of nine that means you
had one rep left in reserve that would
be the same as saying one rir
if you had an rp of eight that means you
had two reps left in reserve
and so on now it's still being hotly
debated just how many reps you can leave
in the tank
and still maximize hypertrophy and in my
opinion this is the million dollar
question right now
for example on the low end some experts
like dr mike zordos
seem to be comfortable setting the
threshold pretty low at least in certain
contexts
having said that you can grow just fine
maybe five to seven reps from failure so
that'd be a true rpe
of three to five dr eric helms has
recommended zero to five reps in reserve
so an rpe of five to ten is a good range
for hypertrophy while others like dr
brad schoenfeld
seem to set the bar a bit higher having
recently made recommendations in the one
to three reps in reserve range
so an rpe of seven to nine and maybe
take the last set or two to failure on
certain exercises
just to be safe i think that these can
all make sense depending on the context
for example if you're training with
sufficiently heavy weight i think you
can get a solid hypertrophic stimulus
by leaving four or five reps in the tank
that's because you should activate most
motor units from the first rep of the
set
especially if you're a more advanced
trainee however if you're doing lighter
weight say something over 12 to 15 reps
you really shouldn't be leaving more
than one to two reps in the tank tops
but there's an obvious issue here this
rpe or rir method is highly subjective
and if you suck at guessing how many
reps you have left in the tank you do
risk falling below that bottom end
threshold this is why in another video i
touched on the importance of doing
anchoring sets if you haven't done this
lately or ever
actually do it the next time you train
pick an exercise that you can fail
safely on
and go all out with good form call out
when you think you've got two reps left
in the tank
okay and then keep pushing to see what
it feels like to truly go to an rpe of
10
and to find out how close you are with
your called rating another way to get
better at this is using rep speed
which is gaining a lot of momentum in
the research lately one group of
researchers even developed a set of
equations
that can predict how many reps you have
left in reserve using velocity loss
within a set
so in theory we can use their data in
this table to predict that if you're
doing a set of bench press
with 80 of your max and the reps have
slowed by half
so 50 you should still have 1.6 reps
left in the tank
so one to two reps in reserve and while
i know some power lifters have started
using rep speed trackers in training
i think most of us should apply this
research more broadly for now
one thing i think we can all benefit
from doing is simply recording a set
watching it back and observing how the
rep speed changes toward the end
if you don't notice the reps slow down
at all you may not be pushing it as hard
as you think you are
even if it feels quite challenging in
your head so let's start with an example
from me
this is a set of 11 reps that i did with
eric helms and we were aiming for an rpe
of eight what was the rp
i call that an eight eight yeah is it
less than eight
might have been a seven and a half
actually now that i'm watching this back
i think it was more like an rp of six
maybe seven so the first rep took 0.8
seconds
second rep was 0.9 seconds we'll fast
forward these middle reps
and jump to rep 9 which took 1.1 seconds
so it is slowing down a bit here is rep
10 which took 1.13 seconds
so about the same speed there and then
here's my last attempted rep which took
1.23 seconds
so when i do it the math that's 28
velocity loss from the first
or fastest rep to the last rep and if
just for fun
we round that up to 30 and plug it into
the squat data from the rodriguez
russell study
that would correspond to 3.5 reps in
reserve assuming the set was around 70
of my one rep max which i think is fair
so 3.5 reps in reserve would be an rpe
of six or seven
not eight now i honestly don't think we
can extrapolate this data across
exercises like this
so i'm just gonna keep it in mind but
ultimately put it away for the next few
examples we'll cover
and while i definitely wouldn't call
this a useless set especially when doing
multiple sets
in my opinion i probably should have
done another one or two reps to get in
that rpe8 zone
okay next let's see an example of what
zero reps in reserve or rp
10 really looks like this is a set from
men's classic physique champ chris
bumstead
so let's pay attention to how his rep
speed changes throughout the set
so he's just finishing rep four here so
this is rep five and we're at one point
two seven seconds
rep six is one point two three seconds
rep seven a bit of a grind
one point nine seconds are you still
going at rep eight we're at 1.9 seconds
again
now rep 9 is considerably slower at 2.5
seconds
now here is his last rep much slower a
full 3.2 seconds
and i think that's it i don't think he
could have got another rep without a lot
of help from his spotter
now playing this back i personally would
save this level of exertion for the last
set of an exercise
or you could even stop two reps shy of
where chris did to mitigate fatigue a
bit
and then push like this in the last week
of a training phase but i still think
this was a beautifully executed set to
zero rir
or maybe slightly beyond if you think a
spotter helped a bit on those last few
reps there all right so let's see an
example of what one rep in reserve
really looks like
now in my opinion this is where a good
chunk of your training should be
if your main goal is to maximize
hypertrophy so this is a set of six reps
by ifbb pro
john meadows let's watch
oh yeah easy easy
let's go come on two more
yep one more nice
easy so yeah watching this back you can
see john has a very explosive tempo
and pretty consistent rep speed
throughout the set and then he starts to
hit the wall more abruptly
on these last couple reps here but based
on this last rep speed
i'd say he could have done one more rep
with a big grind but no more than that
okay next let's look at an rpe seven to
eight set so leaving two to three reps
in reserve
this is a set of eight reps from ifbb
pro kai green
so these first few reps are moving
really smooth and consistent i think
he's getting
a little boost from his spotter but
judging by the bar speed of these last
few reps here
it looks to me like he had another two
maybe three reps in the tank
and of course i think this is a
perfectly stimulative working set
especially given the load he's moving
okay next i want to look at a set
that probably isn't stimulative enough
to maximize hypertrophy
to a set to an rpe of five or less now
of course there are
tons of examples of ronnie coleman going
to an rpe 10 and beyond
i personally think he's the greatest
bodybuilder of all time and no one in
their right mind would argue that ronnie
didn't train hard enough
[Applause]
[Music]
but as an exception to the rule i did
want to look at this set of pull downs
because this is the type of set you see
all the time where someone calls it off
before they get anywhere near a failure
now this could have been a warm-up set
for ronnie
and he might have done 20 more sets
after this i'm not sure
but on a per-set basis i would say this
proximity to failure
would be insufficiently stimulative for
the average person to maximize
hypertrophy
and judging by these last few reps here
i would say he still had another five to
ten reps left in the tank
no real rep speed slow down no real
grindy reps
now by contrast here's the last three
reps on a set of pull downs from natural
pro
alberto nunez to a true rpe of 9 or 10.
notice how he doesn't break technique at
all and really grinds out the concentric
on this last rep here which takes a full
4.17 seconds to complete
and i would say this is perfect effort
for the last set of back on a pull day
okay now let's take a look at a set that
i would say is
in my opinion too much effort so this is
a recent set of five reps
from ifbb pro greg doucet now i know
greg's working around an injury and
hasn't squat in a while
so keep that in mind but i did want to
include this because i think it
illustrates another type of set
that we see very often which is when you
feel the need to push to an rpe of 10
even when it comes at a higher risk and
recovery cost so my two cents on this
set would be to strip the weight back
start at something around an rp7 and
then over the coming weeks
as you get more locked in with the
technique gradually ramp the rpe up over
time
or if you really want to take a set to
an rpe 10 like this which certainly does
have its place
i just save it for a machine or
isolation exercise or until you get the
form more dialed in again
now by contrast here's a hard set of six
reps on the squat from matt ogus
that leaves one maybe two reps in the
tank and we jumped in here on rep three
of six
just to save time so this is rep four
right here now in my opinion
this is a more effective but still very
hard set
you'll notice his technique is
completely dialed in and while he isn't
breaking his back trying to get the
weight up
you can still see the reps slowing down
as he gets closer to the end of the set
here
now he pauses on this last rep which
you'll see and that makes the concentric
a bit slower
but i still think this is the perfect
example of an rpe
eight or nine set that should still
probably come toward the end of a
training cycle
okay and lastly i want to look at a few
examples that seem to break the rules
first let's look at this set of
deadlifts from steffi cohen and i want
you to watch this first rep closely
okay i'm gonna pause it there actually
let's swatch it back again
okay so after that first rep do you
think she's got another rep in the tank
or is this
rpe 10 already let's see
so here's rep two and
rep three and this is rep four
and rep five we're just gonna keep going
rep six she's not done yet that's rep
number seven
and she's still got more this is rep
eight
still going rep nine is finally starting
to slow down a bit
and i think she's gonna go for one more
here so this one is a
big grind almost a five second rep
and she's done so yeah that would have
been
really hard to gauge based on that first
rep speed so just keep that in mind
you can't always just look at a single
rep in isolation and determine
rir based on that alone there are big
individual differences with this
okay here's another example of when it's
hard to gauge rir
based on rep speed so this is a set of
elevated dumbbell squats from ifbb pro
sunny andrews where she's using a strong
mind muscle connection
constant tension and a very smooth tempo
on both the positive and the negative
for the other examples we covered i
picked lifts that use a more explosive
tempo on the positive
because that's how the reps are
performed in the studies i mentioned
but if you're purposefully modifying the
concentric tempo and
really emphasizing the mind muscle
connection it does make it a lot harder
to judge reps in reserve
using rep speed so with all this
information in mind
let's come back to this set from jay at
the beginning was this set hard enough
to maximize muscle growth
i think yes even though he may not have
seen as much rep speed slow down as some
of the other examples
after watching hours of his training
footage i've noticed that despite his
more explosive tempo
jay seems to also use a very strong
mind-muscle connection
and a more consistent cadence on his
reps which means
i suspect he's one of those lifters that
makes the weight look really easy
and then when they hit the wall it
happens more abruptly so yeah
i think this set would be maximally
stimulative for hypertrophy
even for the average person lifting much
lighter absolute loads
but since this is an evolving area of
research and discussion
i want to also leave the question open
and pass it off to you guys
how many reps do you think he had in the
tank and was he close enough to failure
as always i hope you guys found the
video helpful and i'll see you guys all
here
in the next one
[Music]
