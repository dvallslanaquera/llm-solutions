hey folks i'm dr mike from renaissance
spiritization and this is the targeting
the muscle series today's target is the
tricep and we are doing dips
dr mike how do i do dips to target my
triceps well i'm so glad you asked we
have so many tips stay tuned
[Music]
all right folks first big question
before we start doing any dips is where
to put the hanes well we have some
options
we can put our hands here
that offers us a really good grip the
problem is is it's so wide it's going to
end up being that we use our chest a ton
not a problem but we really want this to
be a tricep exercise on the other hand
if we take a very narrow grip
we end up running into ourselves at the
bottom when we don't get a full range of
motion also because we're running into
ourselves our grip can be pushed out and
it can cause instability and blog you
guys know when you're doing dips and
you're like jesus i sure hope i can hand
up hang on to these handles and not get
slipped off that's the wrong mindset to
have for dips you want to be so stable
and steady that you're not worried about
it
somewhere in between the two extremes is
probably best feel free to play around
on this specific implement i used to
grab here and that felt really good but
recently i started grabbing over here
and it's feeling the best because it
allows me to go through a really full
range of motion and feel awesome the
entire time but still feel glued to the
machine so when i'm here i descend nice
and slow
take a pause and come all the way back
up
beautiful
[Music]
all right folks
advanced technique
if you really want to hit your triceps
with dips and don't so much care about
your lower chest
if you tuck your legs behind you like
many people do when they do dips
this actually shifts the center of
gravity back that way leverages your
upper body forward and it ends up being
more of a chest exercise than you may be
interested in
the opposite of that which is the tricep
tip
is to take your feet and stick them out
in front of you a little bit not gymnast
style all the way here plank or whatever
the but just a little bit in front
as they hang
that way you can really stay more
upright and really push your elbows back
and it's really an awesome tricep move
so what i mean is i'll do both for you
first i'll tuck them behind like this
notice i'm leaning forward a lot
nothing wrong with that great tricep
work
a little bit of pecs we could do better
now watch this
if i push my feet forward i can stay
very upright it's way harder
but better for the triceps so instead of
going here
i go here notice even when i do this
here i lean forward when do this i lean
back
go down nice and slow keep your feet
forward
and come up
oh now we're talking
if we want maximum tricep engagement
we want more muscular involvement and a
little bit less connective tissue
which means we don't want to bounce
around and do these fast
concentric speed is okay but eccentric
we want to milk them out
so a huge tip is to do them slow and
controlled instead of rapid and even if
you can do rapid dips it looks
impressive but remember you are
targeting the muscle and you're watching
this video because you have trouble
targeting your triceps from dips you can
do better by slowing it down that means
you'll get fewer reps you can't strap as
many kilos on your waist but it's all
well in the end because it's for the
triceps so
you can do dips in a really normal
occasion so you go here go down
up
down and up and that's cool that's good
if we take maybe two or three seconds on
the eccentric
we can do a lot of really really good
stuff
so instead of going quickly
slow
oh
oh
amazing
a lot of folks who say
that dips don't really hit their triceps
that well
what they're doing
is they're doing dips
from here to here or something like that
which is okay
but if we go for a full stretch
especially if we're upright and our
elbows go far back
that hits the triceps like crazy
remember stretch under load is a big
stimulus for hypertrophy so if we go all
the way down no shoulder pain yet we're
very comfy we're essentially sitting our
forearms on our biceps
that is a full range of motion dip
for that extra extra and for shoulder
safety what we want to do is pause at
the bottom
for one to two seconds that milks that
tricep stretch even more and because
it's a pause means that chest injuries
tricep injuries and especially shoulder
injuries are minimized in their
probability so the final product could
look something like this
nice and deep notice the depth and
notice also that i'm taking a pause at
the bottom
feet forward
slow
pause
up
slow
deep
pause
up
boom
[Music]
hey folks this is a dip video why am i
at the tricep push down station
here's why
a lot of times folks get really strong
and then they either have to use a lot
of weight for dips
or they have to
do a crapload of reps like way more reps
than our effective 30 plus
or it ends up being that for the amount
of dips they have to do to hit their
triceps their chest and shoulders become
the limiting factors or just take on too
much work
we can solve that problem and here's how
what we can do is do tricep work before
dips so if you have a tricep workout
what you can do
is do
cable tricep push-downs of course all
good technique full range of motion
everything and you can do
let's say four or five sets of them
close to failure oh my god your triceps
are pumped to
they're pre-exhausted
when you go to do dips
your chest and shoulders
act as kind of like a sled dog pulling
your damn up tricep tired as
all the way along the track
and that means that they get
unbelievable stimulus with minimum
external loading or reps so if you can
do over 20 dips no problem do a couple
of sets maybe like four or five of push
downs or skull crushers or whatever
other isolation tricep exercise you want
to do
then start your dip working sets and
you'll notice a few things one you can
zap your triceps with just so
few dips and so few sets and so few reps
another thing for those of you who tend
to have a little elbow pain with dips
sometimes just elbow weirdness because
you have done this exercise your elbows
are going to be so warm that a lot of
times dips feel a-okay way better
than they would before now you can't do
as many reps but you feel the muscle
better the marshall better
and you don't feel the joint nearly as
hurt or as irritated that's winning all
around
if you're super strong and
jacked and you have the
best tricep strength in the
world
what you can do
real bonus points
is do a set of 15 to 25 of these tricep
extension
and as soon as you're done if your dip
stand is close by
get right over to the stand climb up and
begin doing dips that is a direct
pre-exhaust superset and will just give
you another option to your up
and after you have messed up triceps you
go into the gym bathroom you do one of
these and one of the guys walks up to
you he's like hey i've seen you and your
big triceps do you just want to get in
my car and ride away listening to aids
music and possibly touching each other
sexually and you go
maybe i'll yes for sure and on that note
i'll see you guys next time
[Applause]
