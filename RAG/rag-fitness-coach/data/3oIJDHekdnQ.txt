weekly webinar dr james factor mike
answering your
most excellent youtube questions mike
how's it going
good how are you james i'm okay
but the mel's like family's over right
now so it's a little bit crazy we got
like double grandma madness we got dog
madness it's a little these bananas
more people paying attention to the dogs
yeah
yeah some guy tried to fight me uh
yesterday that was interesting uh
can you tell us that story dude it was
the strangest thing i so i went to the
vet
because the dogs were getting some of
their like puppy shots
and i'm just sitting in the car like
waiting for because they're doing the
kova thing so you can't go in so they
come and get the dog
and then go so i'm waiting in the car
and i was like oh yeah i forgot they
asked me to bring a bag of poo so i'm
like where's the poo
and i'm like looking for the poo and i'm
like oh i think i put it in the back
and i'm sitting with uh mel's uncle
terry he's just hanging out with me
and i go to the passenger side or the
rear passenger in my car
and i hear somebody and they're like yo
what the fuck is your problem man what
the
these like all worked up and i'm like
well clearly that's not pointed at me
i'm just here at the vet like taking
care of my dogs right so i'm just going
about my business and this guy walks up
on me
and i'm like oh that was directed at me
i was like what are you talking about
he's like what's wrong with you why
didn't you pull your car all the way
forward
he's like just totally like whacked out
of his mind
and i'm like it's a street i don't have
to pull anywhere i parked in front of
the vet like
what's your problem and he was like fuck
you you bitch like all this like i don't
want to hear it
you gotta pull all the way up like he's
just going bananas
and clearly he's like inebriated like
i'm like piecemealing it together as i'm
looking at him he's just going nuts and
i look in front of my car
just to see like if there was even
anywhere to go just to like de-escalate
because like you know when someone's
crazy
it's you just better to avoid the whole
situation right so i look in front of my
car and there's a fucking truck in front
of my car i can't even pull up any
further if i wanted to
look i look at him i'm like dude there's
a car in front of me what do you want
what do you want he's like i don't want
to hear it fuck you you little bitch go
back to where you came from i don't hear
any excuses and he like storms off and i
like
had a moment where i was like am i going
to kill this guy right now
i was like i look i was like doing one
of these like am i
and my like my calm side kicked in was
just like that guy is like
first of all he's at the vet he's
clearly inebriated
he's like some combination of like
inebriated and having a really bad day
it's like what do you what is going to
happen here right just
de-escalate and move on and uh that was
basically the end of it and then the vet
came out and was like hey i'm ready for
your dogs i was like
do you see this crazy guy back here and
he was like what i have no idea what
you're talking about i was like never
mind this guy's like mapped out
he was like oh god yeah i was at the vet
it was like what the fuck is going on
this guy's meth guy is like going
bananas over here can i answer your
question you don't have to answer
sure were you armed that was like it was
literally i just went to the vet so i
wasn't armed i'm like i'm armed right
now i mean like
tada boom
montana way of life for the best for him
that you weren't armed again
well yeah and i was like uh i just was
like
literally just like oh i'm just going to
the vet with the dogs i'm not i'm not i
didn't think about it i just didn't and
i was
and i literally looked at terry i was
like man the one time i wasn't like
packing some guy like some crazy person
came in
do you think you could have handled them
i could have but it was one of those
things
where i was like hey it didn't need to
escalate to like a weapons
scenario and b it really didn't even
need to escalate to uh like a fisticuffs
scenario it was one of those where it's
like i have a clear opportunity to say
like this guy's crazy
i can just walk away why fight you don't
need to fight like why are you
like we're both at the vet for a reason
his he's having issues with his animals
i'm having issues with my animals he's
what i assume to be inebriated let it go
yeah
appreciate it yeah it's just one of
those like i had that moment though
where i was like am i going to kill this
guy
right now on the street and i was like
no that's that's silly it was like silly
of me like you're being silly get out of
here this guy's crazy you're gonna laugh
you're gonna laugh at this tomorrow
yeah i had a guy talk shit to me of
course in philly and i'm sure you
probably heard the story before
and i was like on the phone with someone
else while i was talking shit and they
got in my face
and i was just like i saw the scenario
real quick like i'm gonna single leg him
into this wall
i'm gonna bludgeon him to death and then
like
there's just a huge public space and i'm
completely exposed and like everyone's
gonna see
and there's 50 security cameras of me
murdering a guy and like you know
he probably just gets into fights all
the time and what am i doing i wanted to
be like you know
the jiu jitsu place i train us down the
street come sign a waiver and whatever
issue you have i'm sure we can work it
out but i was just like uh
and it sucks because we're all you know
males and we want to like be territorial
but
at some point you just got to be
reasonable and be like i have everything
to lose here almost nothing to gain
right and that's the other thing too
it's like you know that's going to be on
some security camera where somebody's
going to look at that and see you like
on top of some
skinny guy or meth guy right beating the
shit out of him and it's like who's
going to look bad in that situation
people think the victim in a fight is
the most to lose i don't know
if you lose a fight yeah you could get
killed or roughed up real bad
if you win a fight you go to jail for a
long time because now you're the
perpetrator so
yeah and you think about it like you
could pop somebody and if you knock them
out and their head hits the concrete and
they die like
that situation homicide at least yeah
not good
so that was my life it's been a fun week
it's been a fun week
sounds great let's uh let's get into it
yeah let's do it
all right
whenever you're ready i am ready who are
we starting off with here today
let us go and start at the top as usual
and start with
aerie small all right
got it he's not very big but he is small
any airy
i was thinking harry small wiener which
is kind of like the worst case scenario
yeah yeah 100
um all right ready ready harry small
asks
hi docs certain exercises such as
rudolph flies
only give me a pump sense of disruption
would take it very close to failure zero
to one rar
would it be better to train closer to
failure from the start of the meso for
these movements
and adjust mainly in volume reps and
weight
as starting further from failure on
these movements feels like you're
producing very little stimulus
yes it's fine what i would do is should
test the idea try to do one and a half
times the volume
and not get super close to failure and
see if you still have the same pop of
disruption
and if you literally done like one and a
half times the volume but it's literally
not even close to saying pump a
disruption yeah you can go close to
failure to start with like
if that's the only thing that gets you
what you're getting then yeah 100
james um yeah i agree with mike and i
would also just say like keep in mind
like rear delt flies
you might just not get a lot of pump and
or disruption from
any of those movements it's just one of
those muscle groups you're not going to
feel it
as much as something like even like your
biceps or even a similar muscle group
like your your lats or your rhomboids
it's just one of those like
if you're putting in the work you're
doing a reasonable rir
i think you're fine is this one of those
like don't um
one of those paralysis by analysis
situations don't overthink like some
some muscles you're just not gonna have
that
same response and that's okay yep
and then number two when you talk about
intensity techniques i haven't seen you
mention cluster sets
i guess it would be related to my reps
however i view cluster sets as being
mini sets generally under five reps
after the initial set would this still
be beneficial even though they aren't
hitting the minimum five reps this can
be seen uh part of a larger
set that is hitting in excess of five
whilst at the same time
hitting quote-unquote effectively ups
close to failure multiple times one set
um i don't mention uh intensity
techniques or james and i don't mention
it in our discussions of hypertrophy
because
cluster sets are not a hypertrophy
technique they're a strength power
technique
um mostly a strength technique um and
uh basically yeah the hypertrophy
version would be my reps
how long to rest between my reps is not
exactly clear so cluster sets and my
reps can be seen on the same spectrum
uh of you know intentionally shortened
rest breaks to accomplish something
um and cluster sets are mostly just a
way to save time
otherwise they don't have a ton of value
uh and
would it be beneficial yeah sure would
it be as beneficial as hitting
at least five reps per se no probably
not not
that close so i would stay away from
cluster sets from a hypertrophy
pure hypertrophy perspective james yeah
totally agreed on that and another thing
is like mike and i don't talk
a lot about intensity techniques really
at all it's because we
want people to mostly focus on getting
the solid framework for your basic
training because
just your standard set and rep stuff is
what really carries you throughout
the entirety of your athletic career
whether you're in sports or hypertrophy
training or just health and fitness
i think when you start like if mike and
i were just
went on a tangent we were just like you
know what drop sets are the fucking cool
blah blah blah if we just start talking
about drop sets that everyone's going to
be asking us about drop sets and fucking
up their programs
trying to focus on drop sets too much
when that's not what we want really what
we want people to do is just have the
bare bones stuff
done immaculately and you can explore
the intensity techniques
um you know at your leisure or when you
start not seeing the results that you
want anymore but
it's one of those like you don't hear us
talking about it because we don't think
it's probably that important most of the
time
[Music]
all right number two george
sterner right below harry small got it
av small
i got a lot of got a lot of activity on
this threat
he says hey docs does having a high wart
capacity like an elite crossfit athlete
impact the volume landmarks when
training for hypertrophy
it absolutely does just like any just
like having a low
or normal or anything else i mean of
course yeah that's
i'm wondering if he's saying like
uh i'm trying to choose my words
carefully here it's almost
we're looking for a little ego stroking
a little pat on the back here for being
crossfit person what are we talking
about
uh you know it's like of course it would
impact it your work capacity
recoverability are
directly tied into the volume landmarks
for all purposes um but for somebody who
might be more of a
type one more enduring person or someone
with a high work capacity yeah those
things generally get shifted up a little
bit
just that's the norm so just to clarify
what james meant
the let's take this in context because
there's two different questions here
one is somebody has a high work capacity
it just shows up
or two somebody has a high work capacity
and is still doing crossfit
okay we're just gonna assume still doing
crossfit but there's a slightly
different answer to the question if they
transition
from crossfit to bodybuilding and then
they don't do crossfit anymore but they
have that
history i'll just answer that in the
context of someone training for crossfit
uh also training for hypertrophy their
maintenance volume is going to be fairly
small
because they're already doing a lot of
volume that is relatively stimulative in
their
uh crossfit training their minimum
effective volume
is again going to be relatively small
because they're already doing a lot of
hypertrophic training in their crossfit
stuff
their maximum the mrv
is going to be probably pretty normal uh
on the lower end
uh because the crossfit training is so
interfering that they won't be able to
recover from that and
and their hypertrophic training mev i'll
answer it this way
we're not going to talk about where the
mep is because between the md uh and mrv
uh let's talk about the curve height how
tall the mvp is like how much
growth do they get out of every workout
the answer is both because of their
slower twitch fiber type from being
crossfitters
and because of the interference effect
on multiple levels from crossfit
training
their curve magnitude is just not going
to be very high so what it ends up being
is like they can train
probably as much as a normal bodybuilder
you think how the fuck could they train
like a normal bodybuilder
uh and still recover because they're
fucking badass at recovering their
crossfitters right because they're
training crossfit plus bodybuilding
they get a very very small effect it
does enhance their hypertrophy but not
nearly as what you would expect
as if they would quit now if they quit
crossfit still had all the endurance
then got to bodybuilding
their uh maintenance volume would would
be
you know fairly small their minimum
effective volume would be quite large
because their minimum effect of the
amount of volume it would take to
get them into uh you know they're just
really slower twitch
and they're they've been training for a
long time they're quite resistant to
hypertrophy
so the minimum effective volume would be
quite large and then the maximum
recovery volume like james said shifted
up would also be incredibly high
but again their maximum adaptive volume
would still be pretty muted
because of the the way they got to their
endurance
a lot of the systemic factors which are
good but some of it is local muscular
factors like higher activity of ampk
slower fiber conversion so they just
won't get as much out of their
hypertrophy training
something you would expect from
crossfitters that transition from
crossfit to bodybuilding
is over the years this is kind of cool
if they just focus on bodybuilding
their meds probably either stay or
reduce a little bit as they get stronger
and they lose their crazy fiber types
they had from crossfit
and their mrvs probably decline i used
to be able to do 40 cents a week back
when i was a crossfitter but now i can
only do 20. like well good your legs are
bigger motherfucker and that's because
their nav is going to start rising
throughout that entire time as they put
the crossfire behind them so
yeah and um just i think i think
somebody might interpret what you said
maybe in a weird way um but like just
another clarification uh you can't
possibly train
crossfit and train as a full-time like
bodybuilding training at the same time
you could but one of those certainly
would tank right
so example if you're doing full higher
perch for your training like a
bodybuilder would your
all of your volume landmarks for all
your crossfit stuff would just
immediately grow in the tank you would
not be able to be fast explosive
skillful at many things you'd just be
unable to do those things and if you
train full-time you know crossfit then
try to switch over to bodybuilding
full-time
there's just a competition for too many
resources so what we generally do
this happens all the time with the rp
and i have tons of clients like this
when they um come from a crossfit
background and they say hey i want to
you know like either
lose weight or gain weight what we
usually say is like hey why don't you
just dial down your crossfit training to
more maintenance volumes doesn't mean
you have to stop
but we want you to do as much
hypertrophy training as you can to
preserve and or gain muscle while you're
in this period
but just do enough crossfit training to
maintain your feel maintain your
technique maintain your familiarity with
all those workouts and your endurance
and that's a very very welcome
compromise and then once they get to
like their maintenance phase we can dial
down their weightlifting
and dial back up their crossfit training
and it works great it's really easy fix
yeah um great point james uh sorry what
i meant by that was the first example
was
somebody who splits training 50 50
crossfit bodybuilding and they used to
be in a crossfitter
uh then they can actually which is kind
of bodybuilding right but people do that
shit all the time man like
uh all right
uh number next number number three is
going to be
charles austin just a little bit down
got it
so he says there are some exercises
where i can only do a certain number of
reps with a fairly large weight range
the most obvious offenders from your
calves for calf raises and traps for
shrugs
there is a standing cap machine at my
gym that i can select anywhere from 90
to 150 pounds on the stack and i fail at
around 10 reps every time
i know exactly exactly what you're
talking about i do my best to
standardize ram and tempo
what gives so there's a couple of things
that could be going on from my
perspective
one of the most obvious ones is you have
a huge fraction of faster twitch muscle
fibers
that propel your calves to do what they
do and
they all kind of give out at the same
time uh
when they train them light essentially
they're only active in contraction for
so long because they fatigue so fast
so if they're contracting contracting
contracting they give out
that happens if they give out with a
heavyweight or lightweight they just
sort of time themselves out
and that's probably a real big reason
for that i tend to notice them in my
muscle groups that are the best
responsive
fastest twitch uh that they tend to just
have a certain rep range they can hit
with a huge variety
and like i'm gonna reduce the weight and
do more reps and i get to rep 12 and
it's like
i can't do it i'm like what the hell
happened and it's just it's really
awesome because it's a great you know
the muscle failed and everything and you
got a good stimulus
uh but it's just you're just not doing a
whole lot more reps because there's an
inherent limit there
on the uh the fatigability of the muscle
um and another
consideration and this is probably not
in small muscles but in large ones
sometimes there are systemic factors
that are cap you anyway for a certain
duration
like squatting like you're not going to
be able to squat past a certain number
of reps
for a big rate range you can squat for
15's
because you just run out of breath after
15 reps anyway
not what's happening to you but another
category that can allow that to happen
yeah squats are a great example of that
or for a lot of people like once you get
to 10
like after 10 like doesn't matter if you
drop 50 pounds like you're just not
getting much more than 10 at some point
right and uh that's a really good one
i've had that with the like pull-ups for
me is one of those ones where it's like
i can have
25 pounds or unweighted i'll get to 10
and either way and that's about it it's
not gonna if i take
if i take 25 pounds off it doesn't seem
to be any better uh
i i do think like what mike mike's
explanation there about like the faster
twitch contribution is probably the the
most likely answer and then some other
exercises there could be systemic
factors as well but
we're all just built a little bit
differently that's okay you might also
just like have anthropometry for that
uh a particular movement that's just
unfavorable
so you're always going to just gas out a
little bit more on some movements rather
than others
yep next up
got it uh oh he's trying to sneak in a
couple here
yeah let's take maybe the first two how
about that
sounds good number one should beginners
start
the bodyweight jump training program
with only one or two exercises for a few
sets three to four times a week some
people are obsessed with hitting at
least
100 foot contacts a session which would
take at least
20 sets with regular power training reps
james yeah beginners shouldn't shouldn't
be doing jump programs that's really the
issue the beginners should be focusing
on
a muscle mass or strength gaining
program and familiarizing themselves
with jumping techniques but it should
not be a jump centric program if that
makes sense
so it doesn't mean that you don't jump
it just means that the jumps that you do
are generally pretty low impact and are
mainly focused on learning the
techniques and landing techniques of
those jumps
if uh if somebody came to me and they
were like here's my beginner jumping
program like i would immediately just
just do like one of these because it's
because it's pretty clearly demonstrated
that beginners don't need to do
specific parametric training and they
actually benefit
just as much in the short term from
strength training and probably in the
long term
much more from a face potentiated model
of like building muscle building
strength and eventually transitioning in
the longer years
into more specific plyometric training
so i would not do it that way if you
have a beginner
you can they will see massive
improvements in their jumps from doing
sets of ten in the squat
you know what i mean something like that
or even sets of five i mean something so
i would say focus on
the strength and muscle mass aspects
first teach them to techniques
and then as they kind of hit more and
more and more milestones across their
training age
then you start incorporating more and
more intense versions of the jump
training
yeah i'm glad you said that james is
just like an element of transition there
where you don't ever start jump training
in the sense of like let's do it
you ease into it and so any
recommendation
the people that start with 100 foot
contacts a week there's just some
fucking damn insane it's just like a
fucking
stupid thing people there's a dumbass
program back in the 90s when the
internet was like you had to log on or
whatever
um air alert or whatever and people
would download it and print it up
and like they would do it it was like a
bunch of calf races and stuff like
yo bro i'm going to get my fucking jumps
up bro like fucking basketball like shut
the f it's like
mindless mindless fucking shit doesn't
fucking work and then people nowadays
are like man jump training i want to
fuck get my hops up like
it doesn't that's not how optimum works
for sure now you probably just
from training more you'll be able to
jump higher but you're probably just
better off spending your time
playing more basketball if you don't do
things the right way like a real athlete
would
you ease into them based on needs and
needs analysis
and phasic structure and building
building blocks to get to where you
you need to go not by like jumping into
a program especially with something like
jumping which should be over trained so
quickly
look at fucking jace jumps i'm telling
you guys if you're interested in jumps
this guy was just asking us maybe like a
year ago
i don't remember the exact timeline
about like i want to
jump and we we basically echo these same
points like here's how you do
you know work capacity hypertrophy you
work into some strength you work from
some maximal strength maybe cycle back
if you have a big timeline
and then eventually you work your way
into like a peaking protocol for jumping
and this motherfucker
is i can't i can't get over his videos
they're so good it gets me pumped
yeah you got a guy who's i think he's
like five seven and he's gonna dunk it's
amazing
fucking mugsy bogues over here yeah
pretty crazy
yeah um next question from montes bella
pucci matas we'll give you two today
uh can greasing the groove focusing on
frequency of sessions but neglecting
overload be better for novices who have
under six months of experience in
conventional training
so the one way it can is it allows them
more practice technique
doing more frequent sessions elevates
your technique faster and technique is
such a huge part of beginner gains
anyway that it absolutely can't do that
um now neglecting overload
i'll put you this way i'll answer this
the best way i can until
before james bites the rest of your head
off mine i'm just kidding but
if you have to have a program
that neglects a fundamental principle of
training
you're in deep shit as to why you're
asking to do that it's like asking for
no salt recipes for fettuccine alfredo
and someone goes oh
are your salt sensitive blood pressure
like so you don't like salt
like no i love it it's great i'm just
wondering if you can make it taste good
with no salt
what why the fuck would your salt is
like the number one ingredient to make
food tasting what are you talking about
right so i'm not i mean it's a
completely legitimate question on your
part but just ranting here
is you don't want to fucking overload is
the thing you want and
and to sort of like um dovetail off
something eric helms is big on which is
huge
is you got to establish the quality of
your training first before looking into
frequency
or volume or any of that stuff so every
set you do first of all every rep you do
should be really good and then every set
you do should be very stimulative
and then you can ask how many sets i'm
going to do and then you can ask how
often should i repeat that workout
so don't look at neglect overload it's a
fucking bad idea and it's not going to
get you optimum results
can it get you pretty good results just
by ramping up the frequency yes and
here's where i get to my main point
final point
if you told someone hey dude you can
fucking get in tons of sessions and get
almost as good as you would just getting
fewer sessions but training harder
that's going to be like great and
they're going to be like so you want me
to dilute
the value of my sessions so that i can
do more of them
to get the same or worse result you're
like yeah man grease the groove and
they're like
what and this answer is greasing the
groove question
all together people like what do you
think about greasy groove like for
biceps you're doing 10 pull-ups a day
and blah blah
do three fucking actual back workouts a
week motherfucker i'll tell you if you
pros
don't get that big doing 10 pull-ups a
day or some shit like that
it's a fine way to train it's fine and
it's very effective
but it's time-use economy it's fucking
shit and it's fatigue management it's
fucking shit there's no periodization
what do you stop progressing you stop
progressing my back doesn't grow anymore
i do 10 pull-ups every day what do i do
well what the fuck were you doing such a
dog shit you love this fucking program
yeah i love
can't oh sorry so do good workouts wait
till you recover and then repeat them
sometimes that's higher frequency
sometimes it's lower the overload can
reduce
and increase but you want to keep within
margins if you have to take basically
saying neglecting overload make the
workouts so easy
they're not even overloading just to
grease the groove a lot you get a lot of
real technical proficiency but your size
and strength gains will be sub-optimal
[Music]
yeah so i totally agree with mike and my
initial reaction was exactly
mike's reaction but when i i thought i i
think i understand kind of what he's
getting at here and
hopefully we can maybe split the
difference so um for novices
what we would include and this is very
common and this is what you do in sport
training people just don't think of it
the same way
is technique sessions and that's
something that you could do right now
it's maybe not the the greatest use of
your time
to have them doing a lot of technique
sessions throughout the week on basic
lifts like squats and stuff
you can do that and that's okay
um but it's better spent doing other
things like kind of like they're
sporting stuff so for example
if you show up to a soccer practice a
baseball practice or rugby practice
right you're going to get a lot of
repetitions on some really basic things
the first couple weeks that you're there
and then
it starts getting a little bit harder as
you go same thing here you can you can
do like technique sessions
but for pretty basic things like your
bench pressing your squatting
dead lifting it's probably unnecessary
and i think what mike was saying like
just focus on
the actual quality of the real training
sessions
that should be the biggest priority
and if you think that getting a little
bit more contact time a few more
repetitions or exposures
can benefit their technique in some way
which the literature actually does
support this especially for
sporting skills and that's something
that i've been researching for the last
couple years
for skills and and tactics particularly
increasing your exposures seems to be a
much better idea than increasing the
duration of each exposure so it's kind
of the opposite of hypertrophy training
in many ways where it's like
you sometimes you just want short little
bursts of high quality exposures and the
more frequency sometimes the better not
always um so that's a good
from a technique perspective but it's
just a lot of like mike said before it's
not a good use of your time
so i would say focus on getting that
good quality training session
and for more complicated things like if
you had a weight lifter i would say
yes absolutely technique sessions
throughout the week is a very good idea
if you have somebody who's just trying
to do bodybuilding no
just learn how to do the movements in
training and keep making progress as you
go
and don't waste a lot of energy uh
needlessly rehearsing technique
yeah 100
all right the next person
i'm going to get one that didn't have a
ton of likes but it's up here in the
algorithm
and uh it's a very interesting question
that we haven't answered in a while just
want to make sure that we're clear on
this
so it's going to be nicholas markey
just below charles austin got it
so he says number one is there
much any evidence that artificial
sweetener slash diet cokes cause harm
often uh the natural crowd calls these
poison
um the balance of the evidence is that
if you believed they caused harm
you would have to believe all sorts of
completely nonsensical things for which
there's actually
more evidence so no the balance of the
evidence
it pretty much shows that within huge
boundaries of intake
uh you know just fucking gallons of
fucking diet coke a day
there's no detectable harm whatsoever
and there's not even a theorized harm
so the almost exclusively
the anti-artificial sweetener attitude
is a perfect example of people just not
being
scientific and just sphere-bound
plain and simple um james everything to
add to number one
yeah um just keep in mind right like
water is poison
in enough in high enough dosages right
and that's really the issue here
is are artificial sweeteners uh causing
harm within
you know what we would call reasonable
or operable dosages and that's kind of
the issue
so if you are drinking or consuming
these things
in in quantities that are like beyond
the scope of
normal daily use and we can debate what
that is but
i think most of us would largely agree
or at least overlap on what we think
that is most more often than not
then no the answer is no they're within
normal use they seem to be completely
fine and that's kind of the issue so
you can take any substance any chemical
any food
anything and it's poisonous at a certain
dosage right and so
if you cling on to that and say well if
you just keep adding more and more dose
it becomes poisonous therefore it's
poison
it's a very weak argument
from a scientific perspective yep
number two is there evidence that lean
deli meats the high protein user fat
kinds cause harm to a degree that should
be concerned
about when consumed in daily moderate
amounts like less than a pound
uh the jury's still out on that i would
say so there are some good studies that
show that uh
various additives to deli meats are not
incredibly healthy in the long term
um but then when you factor you start
factoring out other junk food intake and
other processed food intake
out of the equation and lifestyle
elements that seem to come with daily
meat like smoking in an activity
you start reducing the level of harm to
sometimes
in some studies onto technical levels uh
so what i would say is because we don't
know
uh but some studies quite a group of
studies have shown that there's a
potential harm there
that's tiny the harm is tiny right but
it is like a lifetime accumulated risk
certain kinds of cancers especially um
what i would say is
if you can eat the deli meat more in
moderation maybe a sandwich here every
other day instead of like
pound of deli meat every day i would
probably do that for the time being
until at least
until the research got clearer um but if
you're eating
deli meat here and there and you're
super worried about it i wouldn't be
worried about it because it contacts the
risk if it exists at all
is going to be incredibly small and
you've got to be careful with early
research on stuff because there's a file
drawer effect
which means especially early in the
publication on a certain topic
people only tend to publish the
preliminary the extensions of
preliminary studies that
found an actual effect um which is why
it's interesting uh i believe greg
knuckles like a big big proponent of
this
form of scientific inquiry called i
believe registered reports
it's basically like if you want someone
to take your scientific study seriously
you register it before it occurs
which means that you can't file draw it
because you have to publish the data you
have off it otherwise it just gets
removed
from you know it just it doesn't get
removed you registered it there was a
null finding
it looks really really bad on you
institutionally and we also know that
there's a bunch of studies that were
done that
reported nothing so we can't say see all
studies report that this happened
because
900 studies have been published who
knows what they report people just
didn't finish them for some odd reason
that people could look into it more
um so because right now you publish a
study only after it's finished
you could just never publish it if you
want so if you work in a lab which is
basically known as the lab that shows
that the deli meats are bad
and you find a you do three experiments
in the show deli meats are fine you're
like
maybe you'll publish one maybe publish
zero right uh because you know
ideology's still a thing in science
so at the end of the day especially
research doesn't have
uh a ton behind it yet got to watch for
things like the file drawer effect
and way too many false positives and san
jose this is bad and then
five more studies are like but actually
not bad at all uh the eggs are a real
good
example of that in the 80s and 90s
there's quite a bit of research that
eggs are really bad
it turns out it's mostly just correlates
of like the kind of people that eat six
eggs a day
are also fat pieces of shit that just
fucking don't give a
flying fuck about their health truckers
and shit
yeah yelling at someone uh everyone's
yelling right now everyone's yelling so
uh
so basically at the end of the day they
did a bunch more studies better studies
control trials and what they found was
that eggs are actually many ways very
healthy
in the context of calorie balance diet
so uh
in you know physical activity and so on
and so forth so i i would really take a
huge grain of salt
lol with the deli meat uh but you know
being that there's some research i
wouldn't be like
i wouldn't just eat deli meat for every
single meal every single day and then
ten studies come out saying it's bad for
your health and you're like what's the
fuck i have
no idea like well you know you could
have like sort of
uh had a little bit more trepidation but
yeah i totally agree with mike's points
i have not looked into this personally
but
dr wife mel did look into this a little
bit and she
so i'm going to just paraphrase what she
told me so i don't want to don't want to
take any credit for this because she
told me and she did a
seems like a really good job it seems
like the the deli meats that are just
fresh cuts of whatever type of meat like
it's just chicken
and turkey and stuff like that the the
effects seem to be
almost none it just seems to be like a
healthy you know it's a pretty healthy
protein option it's really the ones
where they are there's a lot of
processing
smoking and so if you have like a
fucking genoa salam
some glasses so any of those like weird
mystery meats like you're fucking if you
eat a lot like bologna and shit
i believe if i'm if i interpret what she
said correctly that's where more of the
potential issues can't be it's those
more processed meats the the ones that
are just like you know cut turkey cut
chicken stuff like that without a lot of
like smoking or any kind of
additional processing those seem to not
really have any major consequences at
least
from what i understand yeah
that's that's absolutely
let's scroll down james to eduardo
oh salazar oh my god
spicy name all right eduardo says hi
docs thanks for
everything eduardo are you breaking up
with us
um i have some questions on interference
effect many important organizations
the american heart association the what
the fuck is the ada again the
uh assistant district attorney and the
world health organization
american dietetics association dietetics
yeah that's what i was gonna say uh
recommend at least
one sorry you got me on that one no no
worries
88 barbara uh recommend at least 150
minutes of aerobic training per week for
optimum health
if someone is interested in strength
sports number one how does one go about
building strength while following this
recommendation
or should you just accept the fact that
you won't be as strong as you could be
well first of all you have to accept
that back
second of all you can split up your
sessions to go
as far away as possible uh relatively
low from your training
relatively low intensity have good
nutrition balance your make sure not to
exceed your mrv but i'll give you
actually really really good news
you don't have to do any outright cardio
because all of these recommendations
are made completely in the absence of
the fact that you're doing high volume
resistance training
high volume resistance training you
train five days a week hard for an hour
each time
checks every fucking box of physical
activity so you don't have to worry
about a thing if you do that you're
already golden all you have to do on top
of that
is just don't be a total slob walk
around a little bit get your step count
going be active to go on some hikes and
you're fucking golden
the cardio recommendations are for
people who don't do anything
[Music]
you're serious about your goals and the

coaches in your pocket
cutting edge data science tailored to
your exact goals
the future is here today yeah i'm i was
going to go there and i'm glad you made
that point and really
for people who are relatively physically
active like they do somewhat regular
exercise
uh we're talking about like 20 to 30
minutes per week
is sufficient of like direct cardio
training and
by that that includes like a brisk walk
by the way
is more than enough to actually
stimulate
gains in cardiovascular health right and
so we're talking like a very very very
low dose response relationship
for people who are generally pretty
physically active but but i'm glad mike
said that because if you're lifting
weights and doing that stuff
as long as you're not getting fucking
winded going up the stairs or like tying
your shoes like doing really basic shit
you're probably fine
yep all right
i have a quick idea and then we'll go on
to the next question
cool actually you can preload the next
question is
emiliane macavelli uh big
blue e down down quite a bit
holy spicy names tonight this
motherfucker got
hanging out with uh
what
got it all right my idea
ready oh sorry
we sell some kind of product or service
which is
just we deliver you like
cuffs for your arms or like a
sweater with pads for your chest
and we call it game simulation
and the fine print is that we're only
simulating what it would be like if you
were jacked
very oddly but people misread it half
the time
and think it's gained stimulation and
they think it's going to get them jacked
so they wear stupid sweaters we make
money and they learn a rough lesson
in buyer beware james what do you think
uh there was actually an episode of
spongebob
which basically did this i don't know if
you watched spongebob at all but when
he had the anchor arms uh which was just
like a
like a jacked pair of arms you could put
on to look cool and they had like
tattoos on it and shit
oh my god that was a really funny
episode
that's good it's good i'm all for it
emilian machiavelli asks hello humans
with deep striations on both
body and brain the deep striations in
the brain is
probably not good that's what i suffer
from go get that looked at
i really appreciate that you give
valuable insights to random people uh i
get a question about metabolic rate
thank you so much well you're not random
you're here on youtube
um this might really help people
lose weight because they would not gain
any well reverse diet
making it easier to accept and adhere to
i do alternate day fasting because for
me it's less annoying and energy
demanding than chronic calorie
restriction
in a chronic calorie restriction we know
that metabolic rate drops to maintain
uh with how much you're eating thus uh
it will get you to maintain a
2000 with a body fat that could be
maintained before
let's say 2 500.
i don't know oh eventually
yeah metabolic rate probably doesn't
drop that much but it does
physical activity and stuff do drop uh
unconsciously so okay we'll so
we'll we'll just call it all of neat all
metabolic adaptation together um
number two okay so number one what
happens with metabolic rate if you eat
maintenance let's say 2500 calories
on the eating days zero calories on the
fasting days will amaze the amount of
vitamin
drop will drop faster or slower will
chronic calorie structure will it not
drop
uh at all or very little we have very
good reason to believe
that if they say take a month 15 days of
that late nothing
interspersed uh you know equidistantly
with days
uh 15 of them which you ate more
that your metabolic rate change at the
end of that month would be almost
identical if not identical to one in
which you made the same
monthly calorie reduction just off every
day because
during the end of the days when you are
calorie restricted completely your
metabolism will start to dip
and then during the end of the day when
you are feeding like
a lot uh because you know you eat like
four thousand calories or some shit
towards the end of the day your
metabolism you believe it even eat that
though
um your metabolism would rise to higher
than normal levels
and then the balance is probably almost
the same
is he talking about just doing like like
literally going back and forth like
not eating at all on one day and then
yeah true
alternate day fasting yeah
and then he says what about if he'd on a
surplus of 500
let's say 3 000 calories of eating days
zero calories on
fast days how would the body react is
there possibility
to reach your body true caloric
maintenance rising your metabolic rate
this way
without gaining weight so there's really
no way
to increase your body's metabolic rate
without gaining weight unless it's
recovering from an old
reduction once it's recovered from an
oil reduction there's no
trick to use to get it to go super high
um that's definitely the case
um and and then he says of course you
could add how many grams of protein you
consider sensible
on fasting days for the protein sparing
effect i mean if you're talking about
sensible then it's hundreds of grams of
protein because anything less is not
going to be
very muscle sparing so the most sensible
thing to do is just to not do alternate
day fasting
if you want some days more calories some
days less that's fine
i will tell you and say this if you try
to gain weight you need a surplus that's
the last thing i'll say about this if
you have a surplus
and you only eat every other day you
will gain a fraction of the total muscle
you could have
uh and more fat actually because your
body will
be eating a ton of food in one day you
can't possibly turn into muscle
uh and then be starving another day in
which the muscle growth is just not
gonna happen
and some loss will occur so uh i would
say consistency of caloric surplus is
much much better than uh these super
crazy ups and downs
um uh you know if it's worth it
lifestyle to you for cutting and you're
not
super worried about muscle retention
alternate fasting works really well it's
really healthy
um if you're concerned remotely about
optimizing muscle retention and muscle
growth
alternative fasting is probably not the
wisest thing in the world to do
yeah i absolutely agree i think people
who are really big
so i'm not against fasting for a
personal preference reasons and
uh just you know things along those
lines
um but i think the fasting
crowd has like desperately clings to the
idea that fasting has
all these various life hacks which they
just don't
and i don't want to like poopoo the idea
because again if it works better for you
and it's something that you can comply
with and it fits your needs and stuff
like yeah that's great that's awesome
um but there's nothing magic going on
there mike already explained why and i
just i have to just reiterate that point
there's no like crazy life hacks going
on with the fasting there are
potentially some health implications
there maybe maybe not
but in terms of like if you want to be
like a if you want to have like a real
killer body comp or you want to be a
really good athlete i
really just don't i would advise against
it
all right
[Music]
nolts
oh it is notes about that
all right all right
let's see what are your opinions on
taking a week completely off sunlight
cardio instead of taking a dealing week
muscle strength loss won't occur since
just a week so why not let the cns
recover 100
and recover fully mentally as well and
it is their way to recover between
cycles with being the least amount of
time in the gym
as a student i don't have lots of free
time therefore
um i really don't like it this is i have
to say this
yep yeah i was going to say you don't
get that you don't get to pull that card
here
james and i have been professors i'm i'm
a professor again
uh we've been students for i guarantee
you a very very long time cumulatively
we know how it works you've been to
college for two fucking long you have
fuck
fuck a lot of free time you're just
using it to do fuck off
if you have time to train then you have
time to deload homie like what are you
talking about
yeah but in any case uh i don't have a
lot of free time therefore taking a week
off or doing just a few like that
uh two deload sessions and a recovery
week be a great recovery mentally
physically and having more free time
no you're totally right about that it
does definitely has some advantage it's
absolutely true
it's not that i want going to the gym
but going to the gym female fatigue it
doesn't really pleasant
true totally going for walk outside or
do something cardio will be a lot more
enjoyable
so uh is there a way to do it yeah
absolutely if you want to really
condense your dealer
get most of it out of it do two sessions
in your dealer week one relatively heavy
session with much lower volume early in
the week
later in the week one light session with
very little volume just going through
the motions kind of a big warm-up
and that that means you come to the gym
twice as a matter of fact that second
session you can probably do with
bodyweight stuff
wherever you are especially if you have
a tree branch to do some pull-ups off of
that's it okay that's as easy as it gets
and it gives you 90 some percent of the
benefits of
of the uh the deload the reason
so there's a couple just real quick uh
week off is fine it gives you probably
70 or 80 percent of what you're after
versus deloading deloading is better
because doing light training actually
lets you recover faster and more
completely than taking a week off
completely
uh believe it or not cns and all that
recovers faster if you're training light
and deload style
and probably more thoroughly uh and also
it allows you to
maintain fitness a little bit better
specifically maintain technique uh
which means if you're a straight power
athlete then you're definitely going to
be stronger after the d load by long
shot as opposed to
trying to find your your uh your bambi
feet
again james yeah absolutely so that's
the kind of there's kind of like a maybe
a three-tier punch there as though
like mike already said one it seems to
doing the d-load seems to be better than
not doing the d-load in terms of
uh retaining your performance
to your if you just take a week off
um you're essentially deconditioning
across the board not only in terms of
your muscle mass but in terms of your
technique and a variety of other things
um and i had a third one which i can't
seem to remember
but those are probably the two biggest
ones right so you don't really gain much
by taking the week off outside of just
time and
mental break from doing the training
stuff so we usually say like just do it
and if
if you can get the same basic effect
from doing two days per week which is
very doable
just do it why because your muscles
won't be uh atrophying as much and your
technique won't be degrading as much
and you're gonna get all the benefits of
taking the d load right versus just
taking the time off which is
okay but not as good so that oh that was
it that was the third one so you have
your deconditioning in terms of your you
know your muscle and in terms of your
technique which is
also very important so people ask us
this one all the time
we say when possible just do the deload
if if not try and squish it down into a
few days and do the best you can
yep all right part two of this question
is
if you stop training your muscles will
shrink attribute won't occur in the
first weeks
but your muscle glycogen stores shrink
with the muscle appear smaller or
flatter
how long does it take before muscle
glycogen stores start to shrink how long
can you go without training before the
muscle
loses its fullness so a couple couple
answers here
one there's an experimental thing this
is different for different people so you
have to just try
uh two is mostly it's not your glycogen
reducing it's the uh
water content and inflammation
oh uh sure
that idiot behind you james
oh sorry these people are going to be on
the internet forever are those mel's
relatives
yes they do they know this is being
recorded yep
level of giving a fuck zero hey mom and
dad
word up um so
it's really just the intracellular water
and the intracellular damage and
inflammation
and peripheral damage inflammation
around the muscle cells that's giving
you that fullness from training
it's not the glycogen after that
intracellular damage goes away
and you eat some carbs you can actually
load more glycogen
the the total amount of time is five to
seven days i would say
of when your muscles can look their
fullest after training right after from
the damage and then later from glycogen
is sort of a 50
50 split as one migrates out one
migrates in after five to seven days
then you start to lose fullness
uh mostly because you can't load any
more glycogen and that damage component
is very very small now and then
there's like a tonus like a nervous
system preparation
that gives your muscles a bit of a
fuller look that starts to decay after
that so
yeah about five to seven days i wouldn't
bank on anything else so i put you this
way
if you want to look super jacked and you
you're going on a camping trip and the
super hot girl gets there at day four i
would train right before the trip i
wouldn't like wait a week and then
get four days after that your pecs are
flat and you're like hey
stacy it was always kind of she's like
i'm going to cut you off right here i'm
not into guys with smaller packs to get
the
fuck away from me and then you're like
what do you mean she's like get the fuck
get the fuck away from me you fucking
hurt me
fuck you get out get out get out and
you're like oh my god
you start crying you run and you just
keep running
yeah uh it's very good uh just keep in
mind too
um all this is also very much dependent
on your physical activity level so
five or seven days is a pretty good
recommendation but if you don't do dick
like if you just don't
exercise or move around all that much
you won't really tap into your glycogen
stores all that much they'll just kind
of linger on for a while
uh likewise if uh you don't lift
and you don't do very much physical
activity you are more prone to
atrophying than someone who is at least
physically active and not lifting right
so these are all very much mitigated by
your activity levels as well
you can um i mean the thing that we
haven't quite
figured out yet especially with
the muscle itself is like what really is
what really does constitute a
maintenance volume in a lot of cases
because
as you get older it seems like it's very
easy for you to preserve the muscle mass
that you have accrued over time
and it seems like some very minimal
physical activity can help you maintain
that muscle in lieu of direct training
now if you want to be like dr mike's
size like a bodybuilder
um yeah that means that you're going to
have to actually do a little bit more
direct training than somebody like me
who's just going to have like a dad bod
in a few years
but it also seems like yeah if you do
some physical labor around the backyard
is that enough to hit an mv in many
cases yeah probably for at least some
muscle groups if not many
so we're not really sure but again a lot
of this is mitigated by how much
activity that you do so if you don't do
much activity
you're probably going to see more
atrophy and your glycogen stores will
probably uh
linger on so it's kind of the opposite
problem
all right let's scroll all the way up
now james to brown t
thomas lee brown
brown t thomas lee just above the reds
oh brown tea is in his youtube channel i
thought that was like
i thought we had a east versus west bowl
going on here that'd be sweet
all right thomas lee asks when do soccer
players do i purchase your face
fat gain which i would expect to be so
optimal for performance with season
but their off season about 12 weeks and
top leagues can be quite short for our
approaching phase
because they are not training hard for
much of that time in order to drop
fatigue james
hit this one completely
yeah so the this one's kind of tough
because some sports like soccer can have
multiple seasons they can do indoor and
outdoor
and so what you have to know is going
into that is
you won't have a lot of time that is
appropriately
divvied up for hypertrophy right so what
we usually would say is
uh for most team sport athletes you're
going to want to do your hypertrophy
type training whether it's to gain
muscle or to
lose fat in your general preparatory
period so this would be
um kind of like what like he was calling
the off season we would say this is like
you know probably two to three months or
more away from any
significant competitions that's what you
want to do that and then once you start
getting into your specific preparation
or
close to your competition times you're
going to switch to stabilizing your body
weight and you're going to just play at
that body weight from that
at that point on the problem is is that
most team sport athletes shouldn't be
filling up a huge amount of their time
doing body composition alteration really
it should be probably like a 10-week
thing
in little chunks at a time because
that's too much time away from doing the
things that make you
really really good at soccer and
soccer is a really unique case where you
might do indoor and outdoor
so you would like for example if you
just did outdoor
you could run up mass phase play the
season and then you could spend your
very long off season doing the cut phase
to get your body weight back down to a
better place
when you've got multiple seasons you
really you don't have a lot of
opportunity to do that so you might only
be able to run like
two four weeks so maybe like eight weeks
of mass eight weeks of cut
out in a in an annual cycle
and you just have to make the most of it
and make very very slow
small changes over time the the thing
that you should not do
100 and this is what most people do do
do do um is they say i'm a team sport
athlete i'm going to do what
bodybuilders do for hypertrophy and just
gain a
fuck load of weight and just blow up and
jabba up no
no no no no no no because now you're way
out of your ideal
power to weight ratio your ideal
competition body weight all of those
things so when you're a team sport
athlete like a soccer player
although you're not awake a weight class
athlete you have to keep yourself in a
pretty reasonable
shot of your ideal competition body
weight because you can't spend
15 20 weeks at a time doing this
hypertrophy stuff because that means
you're just not
able to train your soccer stuff to its
fullest capacity
why is that was because you're going to
be doing the highest volume of training
that you can essentially tolerate
so that means take your volume landmarks
for skills and tactics and of course
systemic fatigue right and
dial it all down there's no way
that you can be your sharpest working on
your your skills drills tactics
when you are doing hypertrophy training
so we usually say do them in smaller
like more fast furious chunks and you
know i'm a little remiss to say this at
times but
sometimes you can go above and beyond
the typical hypertrophy recommendations
that we give
in terms of weight rates uh sorry rates
of weight loss or gain
simply because you just don't have a lot
of time to work with so you might only
have eight weeks 10 weeks
and that's your hypertrophy phase for
this maybe for this annual plan uh and
just gonna make the most of it so
sometimes we go a little bit harder than
we normally do
luckily we also don't spend as much time
doing those things so we tend to
normalize a little bit more fast
was that an uh okay ramble there i felt
like i started to ramble a bit
totally okay that's why people pass the
big boxes to ramble
okay good okay and sorry
shameless plug shameless plug on that
one uh check out the book that i
co-authored with the tudor bomb
institute's called integrated
periodization
and we lay that uh those ideas out
more explicitly for like team sports and
stuff like that
all right
here we go
just below yari yeah
the red skull actually great question he
says do different muscle groups have
different lengths of protein synthesis
muscle growth
is it assumed that for example chests
and biceps would have an equally hard
exercise
do they both grow 48 hours for example
so we actually just don't know
there's not enough direct literature to
say that with remotely any
conclusiveness however
it certainly wouldn't be something you
would expect to be the same
so prepare for differences if and when
science catches up
when science catches up to tell you that
um
the important caveats for when to read
studies that do come out on that
is relative volume versus how much
actual disruption and stimulus was
delivered to the muscle
so if you compare like three sets of
squats three sets of bicep curls
and you realize that the squats grew
muscle for longer in the quads than the
bicep curls did in the biceps
you may be tempted to think the squads
you know take longer to grow muscle
than the biceps that might not be true
it might just be that the three sets of
curls were just not nearly as
relatively stimulating the biceps as
those three sets of squats were to the
quads so
the question would have to be answered
probably a similar level of soreness
similar level of muscle disruption
but i would probably like to see is
similar levels of
muscle performance decrease so we
stopped at the sets on both the quads
and biceps
once both got to below 70 of their you
know usual reps from set one something
like that then you have a much
more a relative but objective metric for
for cutting off volume but that being
said
we don't have to know that so much
here's why uh
this is kind of a cool practical insight
we already know that different muscles
trained different ways take longer
shorter to recover we know there's a
recovery difference we also know another
thing
with hard training the duration of
recovery
is almost certainly at least a little
bit longer than the duration of growth
so recovery is almost always the
limiting factor
stimulative frequency not muscle growth
we don't
not train six times a week because you
know we're
completely done growing uh you know
after only two days
and anything you know more frequently
stupid you may be done growing after a
day
not in every case but in some cases but
you might not be healed to hit the
muscle again in an overloading matter
until two days fatigue just takes longer
to come off than the amount of muscle
that you grow during that time
so in any case you want to train as
often as your recovery can allow
uh whatever level you examine that on
joint connective tissue muscular etc
it's a complex picture
but in general if you're waiting so long
that everything's really just peeled and
you couldn't overload
again but you're not you're almost
certainly killing time
and you could train more often and be
better now if you say okay theoretically
i saw that biceps recover every
24 hours so should i train my muscles
once uh every day
and the answer to that is what can you
recover from that and you're like well
no hell no i can't so what the fuck
would you train like that that's just
not a sustainable way of training
to get really good results so so that's
that's the end run is really the
recovery we know is different
and that's what really determines time
courses anyway not uh
muscle protein synthesis elevation yeah
that was a really good answer i was
going to go the
recovery direction but you beat me to
the punch so very very nice
nicely done all right
that's it i've sent questions but i want
to lead lorenzo
rolex um
4chan bullshit over here right below
okay so i'm always fascinated with this
style of text or whatever
because it gives off like alt-right
4chan gabber type vibes of like
it's incredibly difficult to read and
it's like full of
like innuendos and memes and it's so
like doge gif internet culture that i'm
barely keeping up like maybe i'm just
old or some shit but i just want to read
this and see if we can follow along
and how much
um all right lorenzo says
uh arrow bored in my clinical psychology
lecture
arrow talking about how to identify
borderline personality disorder arrow
my face when we're watching a video of
lyle mcdonald
uh okay does that mean they
they uh watch that together in class
or does that mean he saw it by himself i
think he's
i i would interpret that as like he's
making like maybe an eye roll face like
he would when he's watching
a video of lau mcdonald like he's doing
that in class
it's the same reaction he would get in
his current class situation as he would
when he was watching a lyle mcdonald
video that's
that's how i would look at that i guess
god okay cool uh
arrow notification goes off get
distracted check phone
arrow new webinar for mike and james oh
subscriber
yes that's right arrow uh
excited dot png so png files are a
picture
of files or gifs or something like that
all right so it's a picture of
excitement
and then arrow no intro with maddie
fourberg
arrow slightly disappointed loved her in
brood strength series a great display of
general physical preparedness
arrow go through time stamps arrow oh
boy a question about left tricep
twitching
arrow call the boys clue what that means
is this yeah i don't think he's calling
anyway
they're doing webinar and chill there's
no way
uh and then arrow quote mike is going to
do a story again for the umpteenth time
about how injured his triceps doing
heavy rows
and how he flexes and now if he flexes
his chest really hard it will continue
to flex for a few seconds after
and it uh and nobody in existence
uh knows its cause that's true i've told
the story a whole bunch i'm glad you're
tuning in lorenzo
um aero my face when it doesn't happen
so like what is your face when it
doesn't happen
i don't know that's why i interpret so
i'm thinking that he's like he's like oh
mike's gonna go through this story
and then you didn't and he's like oh
well i don't know
what what is your i want to know what
emotion you were experiencing was it
just was
dissatisfaction we're the early
millennials we need the emojis you gotta
at least you gotta put a smiley face i
learned how to use emojis
on my phone what is it i don't remember
what the right
word for it is i call it the early
millennial right there's like the like
yeah
people who were born like in 1985 or 86
or whatever that's us
yeah yeah 1980 to 1990. we're like we
know the internet but like we were
around without it as well
uh okay arrow go back and forth between
timestamps to double check
arrow notice james hair arrow is
actually
really nice
james's hair is actually really nice is
that what that means
i hope so everyone was all mel's family
was giving me shit when i like shaved
off my
my mohawk area yeah
arrow 8-chan arrow in cell jk
loretta shots fired well thank you for
that story
um god damn the internet passed us by
james where are the dupes here because
every motherfucker probably reads this
and i was like
lorenzo made a great point we're like
what the fuck hey mike
you remember zip discs hey mike you
remember oregon trail
yes hey mike remember whatever that
shitty word processor was for the max
that they made us use
yes and then you did you did the cursor
like this on paint
and then it would show up like like that
because it would render like with a five
second delay
absolutely remember math blasters
dude i remember all that shit do you
remember our objectively lower standard
of living in every way describable
because technology has made everything
better yes yes
did you ever play the like elementary
school
game the carmen san diego game yes
dude i sucked at that game so bad
geography is still my worst
you know like skill should you be like
hola
como estas where am i i'm like cleveland
she's like no goddamn nobody's going to
cleveland james no one is ever
going to be like oh look bienvenue i
have some wine and a baguette
where am i now i'm like akron
she's like how do you know all these
places in ohio goddammit you saw why do
you only know
ohio you're like all right all right
cincinnati
exactly dude i blew at that game
oh carmen san diego donda estas
you know was she hot
so like me now would say yes but me back
then just didn't understand
she was she was featured she's that lady
from modern family
she was she was the who's the wife the
hot wife from modern family
yeah sofia vergara the fear of regard
yeah
that was that's the same person
basically right yo
carmen san diego is fine as hell yeah
that's what i'm saying she's got like a
new
like she's a cartoon character or
whatever
what if dora the explorer becomes carmen
san diego when she gets older
it's like a time time thing like a
terminator thing
she's like still exploring but she's now
like
i'm so good at this shit i'm gonna make
y'all motherfuckers figure out where i
am
because usually she would just be like
hola like i am here
now she's like where am i exactly no
shit
exactly and then carmen san diego goes
back in time to kill her earlier
dora self because of the terminators
somehow they're tied in q matrix freeway
music
okay i'm late to the party on something
matrix related and i'm
definitely not trying to stir the pot in
any way it's just me
being ignorant wait arrow begins to stir
pot
am i doing it right no i had no idea
that
what what who i knew as the wachowski
brothers i think are both trans now is
that correct
i heard they were trans a long time ago
they were transforming was cool
yeah i had no idea i was just
in my mind there were always the
wachowski brothers and then something
came up with the matrix and they were
like
from the i don't remember what they said
and i don't want to get it wrong
but i was like oh that's weird and then
i was like oh that's
that's i had no idea i don't even know
what they look like and never googled it
and
don't care one way or another because
the
god damn you give us the matrix you know
what i'm saying yeah fucking
words is yours literally because the
matrix aren't they doing another a new
one
i can't get excited about it james but i
would love to
if if um i don't want to get excited
about it if i don't know if it's
happening because
i keep hearing like like rumors i know
it's on my phone or what but like
all these like potential keanu reeves
movies that keep that are like allegedly
coming out
john wick five is being filmed at the
same time as john wick four
oh sweet if lawrence fishburne better be
out of these goddamn movies already he
made no sense
in three i was like all right get out of
here already
james we've been friends for a long time
yeah
i'm just going to tell you this called
me you're just going to scold me guys
watch your fucking mouth
the lawrence fishburne no sense you may
know you make no sense goddammit
he's like i'm the king of the messenger
pigeons yes
i love it that's so laurence fishburne
though it made more than enough sense
for me
i was like this made way more sense than
the matrix morrison lawrence fishburn
must be one of my favorite actors ever
if he's in anything that movie whatever
goes straight to hell because i'm just
interested in the
special one at that point like if i was
like in a movie and i was like a drug
dealer picking up from lawrence
fishburne
as soon as i walked into the scene he'd
be like where's the stuff like oh my god
oh my gosh
fish brother like mike mike mike pause
you have to call him by his actor name
i'm like
no character you're like no no that's
laurence fishburne you motherfuckers
need to have some respect
uh lawrence fishburne amazing made the
whole fucking matrix
neo uh yes get out of here
lauren aging in the matrix questionable
and john wick
also amazing all right folks
i think we're going to rest it enough of
everyone's time thank you so that's
going to be on the time stamp it's going
to be like seven minutes
mike and james bullshit milo will put it
in too i know
i know all right folks uh great
