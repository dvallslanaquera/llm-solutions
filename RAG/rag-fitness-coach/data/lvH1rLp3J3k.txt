hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization
healthy eating made simple video number
three hopefully you've watched the first
two that would really really help if you
did they're super short
this one is on counting macros so
the situation so far is this from the
first two videos you
already know to do a couple of things
first the most important is you know how
to choose healthy foods
and second of all you know how to make
balanced
protein based healthy meals now
this is going to take you really really
far
and these are the only two things that
you could implement
if you know how to choose healthy foods
and make healthy basic meals out of them
you're good to go you could easily just
stop here and way way way improve your
health
but if you want a little bit further
health
improvement we could alter things
just another step and each one of these
videos is like this
so let's go on this journey together
here's the deal
how much you're eating and knowing how
much you're eating
without even altering it at first is
potentially a really really big benefit
it can allow you to do a couple of
really important things
first it can let you plan your meals out
more precisely with less guesswork and
honestly to be completely honest with
you guys
less anxiety like how much roast beef do
i put on the sandwich like i'm trying to
be healthy and i know the amount matters
but like just eating healthy food is
great but i just want to know an amount
so i just don't go insane thinking i'm
eating too much you're eating too little
so and so forth
knowing how much you're eating allows
you to repeatedly eat the same amount
which is a really good place to start
also make sure that you get all your
nutrients in for a day which means
you're supporting your health really
well
and very lastly but not leastly
very importantly it can allow you to
raise or lower your body weight
at will and something we'll learn to do
in a little bit
later in a couple of videos from now by
changing your food intake amounts but
if you don't know how to track and count
how much food you're eating properly and
accurately how the heck are you going to
know whether to eat more or
less or what more or less even is a lot
of times you talk to people and you're
like hey you know
if you want to lose weight probably a
little less food and because they don't
really know how much they eat they just
like i sort of eat i don't know
it's really tough for them to figure out
what less means or people need to gain
weight to become healthier the opposite
problem is the case
right now calorie and portion counting
absolutely can work but the best form of
tracking is the one we want to teach you
and that's macro counting which is
counting for every meal
and day just those two things the amount
of protein
you're eating carbohydrates you're
eating and fats you're eating
if you add all those three and multiply
them in a special way which almost every
app does
you get the calories too pro these are
macros the macronutrients proteins carbs
fats
counting them as a real good idea now
how are you going to count them you got
a couple options all of them are really
good they have their pluses and minuses
first option is to read food labels you
eat and just
track it and write it down on your
notepad on your phone or something and
count it all up yourself manually
i do that a lot but i'm also kind of a
sport physiologist and i was really my
realm and there's no mystery for me and
it's i've been doing it for so long it's
just second nature
it's tedious you can do one better by
looking foods up in databases which
collate all the normal foods for you and
even branded foods
like nutritiondata.self and nutritionix
database
excellent excellent tools the nutritionx
ones we actually source their data for
the rp diet app which i'll get to in
just a sec
you can download myfitnesspal great app
i think it's free
it attracts everything for you you just
type in what foods you eat and it counts
all the macros and it can really let you
do macro tracking really really
seamlessly it doesn't tell you what to
eat which is a bit of a downside later
but it sure as heck counts up the stuff
now
number four option this isn't the best
option this is just an option how awful
of
a salesman am i of of of our own product
here
the rp the renaissance aspiration the rp
diet app
is an app that absolutely counts all of
your macros for you the thing is it does
many more things that actually does
every single step
of these videos maybe minus supplements
and hydration which is super easy coming
up
it pretty much does everything to make
you a healthy diet
so it doesn't just count macros it's not
just tracking it's an awesome choice
but for those people that are a little
bit more serious about dieting more
involved and definitely want results and
want them asap
but if you're just easing in
myfitnesspal is totally cool just
reading labels is totally cool whatever
gets you
in the know after a few weeks of using
whatever methods you choose from that
slide before you should be in the
following position you should be able to
tell
how many grams of protein carbs and fat
you eat per day in per meal
relatively seamlessly it's just not
going to be that tough
and you're going to be able to compare
macros and sort of see the matrix
where people on instagram are talking
about macros or go i eat this much per
day and this much per meal and you're
like oh that makes a ton of sense and
you can reference it to what you think
like what you're eating you know oh they
eat more protein than me or they eat
more carbs and so on and so forth now
this step happens without changing your
daily
intake all you're doing is learning to
count what you're eating
that's so you can get really good at
counting macros and understanding how
much you're eating
and really feeling out what your current
intake is really like you have to know
your current intake
for when you eventually potentially make
changes to it
later but for now we're not saying this
many macros is good
this many is bad none of that it's just
counting your macros learning how it
works and then after a while you really
have a handle on what you're doing
no pressure at all maybe later we'll
learn how to manipulate right
after these few weeks or longer taking
this and integrating it to the stuff you
learned in the last videos and hopefully
tried to apply
maybe try to apply maybe you in the
future you're eating mostly healthy
foods
you're making awesome balanced meals
with protein and veggie core so on and
so forth
and you are able to tell approximately
how many macros are in each meal protein
carbs fats
and each day and next time we're going
to talk about altering our intake a
little bit
with what we've learned from macroconic
so macro cutting really prepares you
because now you know
exactly what's going on with your intake
now
you might be able to alter a little bit
folks we'll see you
next time
