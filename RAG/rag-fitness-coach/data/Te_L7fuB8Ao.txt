hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
today's video is an interesting topic we
usually don't cover here but
why not give it a shot 10 reasons
to consider veganism we're going to take
a
pretty in-depth look and see what we can
muster up
now the big question here and it's going
to be the big question the entire time
through the talk is
is veganism the way to go now
to begin most vegans sure think that's
the case
and quite literally not only do they
themselves
go vegan or have gone vegan but they're
very very keen
on how do i put this best being
interested that other people go vegan
too
right being very interested however
unfortunately many but not all vegans
even in the public space often struggle
to communicate
the best advantages of veganism and the
best points for veganism
but that's totally understandable
because a lot of vegans come from a
place
of being very very upset rightfully so
at animal suffering
and you know it's hard to have
equanimity
in the face of essentially mass
slaughter which is really what
industrial farming is
so if you come to veganism because
you're
really really upset and emotional about
mass slaughter which damn well should be
by the way
it can be really hard to shift gears and
talk to a person who comes into the
discussion either
already against veganism to some extent
or just
quite neutral and then even if they're
neutral
a lot of times you know accusing people
of being you know for slaughtering or
being a murderer by proxy
it's kind of like a really sort of not
the best way to convince anyone of much
of anything because
you usually if your first and maybe even
only argument is a grotesque insult
even if that insult carries a lot of
veracity to it
uh you know a lot of people just turn
you away
but there are very very good reasons to
consider being vegan
or at least shifting down that spectrum
and they're worth covering they're worth
covering
however the issue is not super simple
okay there are multiple dimensions to
consider whether or not or in what cases
or not
veganism is a good idea versus eating
meat versus eating some kinds of meat
versus
eating other kinds of meat and the
answers
to you know is veganism the right way to
go
are often spectral like they lie on a
spectrum so not so much
being vegan is good or being vegan is
bad or eating meat is good eating meat
is bad
it's a matter much more of better and
worse
and even more so better and worse by
what kind of qualifications
so i've taken a stab at this and i've
arranged what i think
are 10 quite important factors
for deciding on meat consumption 10
factors
and there are almost certainly some i
missed uh and feel free to bring them up
in the comments by all
means and there are certain nuances of
even
the factors that i got that i will
definitely miss so feel free to bring
them up in the comments that'd be really
awesome because other people can read
them and
get a little bit more educated on the
subject
and my goal with this here is to just
get us thinking a little bit more about
this issue in depth in
a sort of tone and an attempt to be
quite logical uh in this situation uh
take the emotion dial and turn it down
which a lot of times pro and anti-vegan
tend to kind of clash and there's a lot
of emotion
not a whole lot of thinking going on and
maybe we can develop
a little bit more clarity on the issue
now i will give
what i think are some pretty decent
approaches and decent recommendations at
the end of videos
i'm not going to leave leave it entirely
up to nuance but there is still quite a
bit of nuance there and a lot of
personal choice for you
the viewer to make so without further
ado
factor number one i ranked these by the
way
roughly in my assessment of the order of
importance very roughly so no
plus or minus here and
we're dealing with spectral qualities
here they're on a spectrum
there's not like this is good this is
bad so for most of these some of these
it's like
pretty clear for most of these it's like
really not bad
possibly even good all the way to
terrible
and we're going to talk about how eating
animals why eating animals
or using them for various products can
be anywhere on that scale
so here we go pain and suffering fact of
the matter is
being killed feels bad for almost all
animals
most animals okay and
for very many animals including very
commonly farmed ones
uh chickens to a pretty good extent cows
to a huge extent and pigs to an enormous
extent
probably being killed and slaughtered
and being factory farmed
feels terrible really really really
really bad
right but to put this in context there
are degrees here so there's a spectrum
for my assessment and these are just
kind of examples but i think they lie
relatively
accurately in relation to each other on
the spectrum you can probably see them
right there
here's the deal the worst
thing in in many instances is to
kill slaughter and including
raise and farm in very inhumane
conditions
a highly intelligent and very reflective
being highly intelligent reflective
beings where a huge spectrum
of emotion can feel terror and harm in
ways that other beings simply cannot
right the qualitative pain is just
higher okay
the ability to suffer truly and suffer
in this eastern wisdom definition of
suffering
not just experiencing pain but
experiencing pain layered into an
expectation of not pain and a hope for
future not pain and attachment to past
not pain
experiencing all that psychic pain in
addition to physical pain
real bad deal so the people or sorry the
beings that experience that the most
are highly reflective and intelligent
humans so if we were to farm
and eat highly reflective and
intelligent humans we'd be doing
like a terrible the most terrible
possible crazy thing
tons of pain and suffering is caused now
cows chickens and pigs actually chickens
cows and pigs in that order
experience incrementally more pain and
suffering at a deeper and deeper level
but probably less so than humans because
they simply
don't have that ability to reflect
nearly as much
okay so chickens cows and pigs
you know so for example if you get a pig
and he's eating at a factory farm
and he's not approximately currently
being hurt there's not a ton of
squealing around him going on and or
you know sort of getting him to think oh
god i'm going to die really soon
there's probably quite a few times
during a pig's life where he's just sort
of happily eating
and there's pain and suffering to come
later but he probably doesn't have
a huge ability to anticipate that and
suffer currently for pain that's
anticipatory future future caused so
what a human does for sure so if you get
a rather intelligent human he's just
like pure terror where he knows like
even as he's eating he's like i'm just
gonna get like electro shocked right now
and i can see everyone around me and our
society's gone and
all these people are moating around me
and it's terrible and i know i'm gonna
die soon and get tortured that's awful
right
so pigs probably do this quite a bit not
as much as humans
so less suffering per unit animal cows
do this probably quite a bit
maybe not as much as pigs but it's a
toss-up chickens probably do this
considerably less which is not a smart
right then you keep moving down the
spectrum what about fish okay there's a
considerable amount of debate in the
technical literature here in
neuroscience about what it is fish
think and feel and seemingly something
like a consensus is like probably not
much
at best not much at best or sorry at
worst
and at best maybe they don't actually
have an emotion anything analogous to
suffering they're more
automaton-like but maybe not maybe they
do have some kind of basal emotion so
they
have a capability to suffer though much
less than other more advanced species
moving down to crustaceans and things
like crab and shrimp and lobster
gee you know it's really a toss-up
they're probably mostly automata-like
where they're kind of more like machines
than they are animals
neural networks are very non-complicated
by animal and human standards
so it's a good bet they probably sort of
feel in the sense that we feel pain and
suffering
suffering almost certainly not they
probably have no uh anticipatory
thinking going on whatsoever
and pain may be some rude rudimentary
form of it maybe not even
okay insects almost certainly don't feel
hardly anything they're literally like
molecular machines scaled up and
laboratory meat
wins this one huge because there's
nobody in pain and nobody in suffering
is
quite peculiar when you talk to some
folks and they're like i'm so vegan i
won't even eat laboratory meat it's like
an
interesting personal choice totally
respect that as far as like telling
other people that that's what they
should be doing
difficult to convince someone at least
on the suffering and pain dimension
because she was you know lab meat
doesn't uh cause pain and suffering at
all
and if you're gonna try to drive a hard
bargain and say listen all animals
suffer and feel pain to the same extent
that's actually categorically false
and it's by no means because that
insects crustaceans and maybe even fish
have pain and suffering at all maybe
fish definitely chickens cows and pigs
so on and so forth so here
we can start to see this on a spectrum
and kind of appreciate okay
if someone says well animals don't
suffer you're like what about pigs like
nah nah pigs like
they don't feel pain like that's almost
certainly false and
so yes we probably should feel at least
very very bad about herding pigs cows
and chickens
sort of in that order descending so
that's just that that's just that
variable
moving on number two
is what i term political precedent so a
lot of times
in discussions uh certain types of
vegans not all not matrimonial
will say listen you're okay with eating
animals right
but you know if we take an animal of a
certain ability let's say
a pig or a cow and we try to find a
human with that same mental ability
right because we're saying it's it's
maybe okay to eat animals because
they're mentally they don't suffer as
much as humans
and we don't care about them as much for
that reason so he's like when we're
eating pork we justify it by saying like
whatever like
pigs don't really suffer suffer like we
do which is probably true
but you know they still suffer a
crapload we'll get to that again later
so then you start thinking okay what if
we take an equivalent human
intellectually to a pig
do we care about them and if we don't
care about them if it's like
intellectual ability and ability to
suffer
if we scale a human down actually find a
real human that's roughly the
intellectual equivalency of a pig
which you can find with severely
mentally disabled folks
then is it okay to eat mentally disabled
folks and here's the deal
there's a profoundly good reason why
it's not nearly the same thing and not
nearly okay here it is
let's just walk down this path crazy
path crazy hypothetical
hang in there with me i promise there's
a point so let's say it's we
sort of fall for that argument say you
know what fine i'm going to be
consistent
if i can eat a pig i think it should be
legal for people to eat mentally
retarded individuals
crazy to say that right sounds crazy
sounds as crazy as it is
and we say okay you know mental
retardation in the technical literature
is a 70 iq cut off okay
and then we let's say find a family and
they have there's two siblings in the
family
brother and sister brother and brother
and one individual scores on i-270
and one scores in iq 69. does that mean
that
the iq70 score is like left to be a
human being and have civil rights and
go on and be you know you know have a
beautiful life experiencing all the
amenities of modern society
and that the sibling that scores a 69 is
like legit just pulled away from the
screaming crying family and just
slaughtered for food
that's kind of insane right kind of
insane and
another example there and i'll tell you
why it's insane in a second so you think
like well that's what we do with animals
almost
uh what about gramma you know like some
people a considerable number of people
get into senility in their later later
years
and their iq their fluid iq actually
goes down and then like if you don't
start so high then you can actually
iq your way down into below 70. so like
if grandma ages into a low iq
did she just get pulled away from the
family like right from her
grandchildren's arms just
slaughter for food well that sounds
crazy right
what about this if we you can say okay
it's crazy
but it's something you can do and it's
sustainable
like we can imagine a psychotic society
that does this
and say like that's just about as
psychotic as a society that eats pigs
and cows and chickens right morally
right seems
so far and there's a lot of validity to
that however
it is not sustainable and here's why
let's imagine who is it that's doing the
iq assessing who is it that's doing the
killing
ostensibly at least that part either
maybe it wouldn't be done by a political
party or organization but it would
certainly be regulated at a political
level
now imagine a new political party gets
into ascendance this happens all the
time in human history political parties
change all the time
and now a new party's in charge and
it says okay well like look we have this
iq test
that if people score below a certain
value we just get to slaughter them food
you know gee whiz you know we do have a
lot of political opposition and we want
to keep getting reelected
why don't we alter the iq test even just
marginally if we can get away with it
substantially
so that our the iq test turns more into
like a political polarity test
it's like are you pro-gun you're like
yes and they're like you scored
65 you go die now in the you know crazy
slaughter chambers
and that all of a sudden is a very
realistic concern we know it's a
realistic concern because
almost every time in history when you
give governments a crapload of power to
do crazy things
usually people float up grab that power
and do the crazy things
right so if an iq test
becomes a test for uh essentially
political opinion for the opposition
this leads to an insane downward spiral
of chaos which destroys the society
i predict in almost every case so
any sort of edict or way of running a
society
that's anything but essentially all
humans get almost all rights in almost
all circumstances humans are special
and if you're human we do not violate
your civil rights short of some very
very intricate things like
you're trying to hurt other people
you're unable to care for yourself blah
blah blah
then if it's anything other than that if
we start making like well some humans we
can kill for food and some we can't and
we have some kind of
remotely arbitrary rule set to which one
of those people
which one of those sides people fall on
this becomes wildly untenable
it is very likely to destabilize society
and of course a destabilized society
means no more elon musk no more tesla no
more amazon food delivery
no more refrigeration no more cooling no
more modern medicine and we're all back
in the gutter in the fucking jungle
right so really really bad for everyone
right what this does this line of
reasoning
renders the so it's okay to eat mentally
disabled people argument as
very very weak okay
eating even very intelligent animals
with a lot of feelings doesn't muck with
that
because we have a rule that says we're
allowed to eat pigs
and if we can eat pigs it doesn't
destabilize society
if we say well pigs are just as
intelligent and able to perform various
functions as some people
why don't we make a rule that says eat
some people that destabilizes society
okay
feel free to disagree and let us know in
the comments but that's kind of a bad
deal
which is why this argument sort of uh
for animal rights the human equivocation
argument falls pretty flatly on its face
okay so from a perspective of political
precedent it's absolutely fine
in my assessment to say that look humans
are special because humans are organized
into a society
and in order for that human society to
continue to prosper and flourish and
grow
we can't just randomly kill off some
humans here and there even non-randomly
it's a really bad idea
right so that is what it is and of all
the arguments for veganism we're going
to take that one and we're going to put
it aside because it's probably not
helpful
for that reason all right moving on
number three is rights reciprocity
ability
okay a little a little thought
experiment you take a room
completely closed off room nowhere to
run you take a vegan
a very good person a bowl of water and
adult gigantic male pig okay and you
just don't give him any food
for forever eventually the pig will
almost certainly eat the vegan okay
because
you know first of all the vegan is
highly unlikely to eat the pig out of
respect for that pig's animal rights
the thing is pigs don't have a respect
for other creatures rights
they probably don't have the
psychological wherewithal to even
imagine that there is this concept
called
rights and that there's this concept
called respect the
they don't do a whole lot of that okay
possibly none of it at all
so the pig is unable to respect rights
and if
animals cannot respect human rights
there is a pretty decent beginning of a
moral argument that says
why should humans respect their rights
back like if someone just walks into
your garage and takes shit out of your
garage and uses it at their own
if you come into their garage and take
their shit they can't be like what the
hell are you doing like
i'm doing the same shit you are right so
because a whole lot of animals
simply cannot and will not reciprocate
human rights it's kind of an interesting
thing to say well they deserve rights
like they do
they don't believe in rights it's not
even a concept they hold right
now again this isn't either or this
isn't like animals can't respect human
rights
there's a spectrum here so here's the
spectrum at the very tail end of the
spectrum on the super super bad side
is if we eat rights respecting humans
okay go back to like
like you know in the holocaust no one
was eaten but you just go back and just
imagine the holocaust
okay you got some person that's an
electrical engineer today
and tomorrow they're in a fucking cage
and you're like
i shouldn't have to respect their rights
i'm like why they can respect yours like
uh the mental gymnastics are really
painful right
so if you are eating or you know
consuming uh as
meat formally uh rights respecting
humans you're doing
from a rights reciprocity ability
perspective a terrible terrible thing
that's very difficult to justify if not
impossible
okay you are committing a moral sin
now we scale that down a little bit and
we have a slightly less bad situation
of let's say eating bunny rabbits okay
we need a bunny rabbit
bunny rabbits do not have a moral
calculus whereby they won't hurt you
almost under any circumstance because
they respect your life to
your right to property in the property
of your own body and liberty and pursuit
of happiness they don't do any shit like
that
they just don't have the offensive
weaponry to kill you and don't have the
instinctual drive to kill you nor do
they really have meat hunger so there's
no good reason for them to ever kill you
so they can't hurt you but only from
lack of ability so
we're not going to cut them all the
slack in the world from wright's
perspective but if you eat a bunny
it's kind of like at least it would
never do that to you now not because
it's morally good just because it's
morally inept
and at least doesn't have any ill will
right so
bad definitely not as bad as eating a
potentially right respecting human
but still bad further down is eating a
cow
like given the opportunity if a cow
tramples the shit out of you because
it's scared or it's just
trying to get somewhere or if you get
put in a you know a container with a
bull
like a male cow it'll fucking kill you
because it's a territorial
super mean animal and yeah i promise it
won't lose any sleep over that fact
so not a whole lot of moral agency going
on there not a whole lot of rights
respecting
it's like if you kill a cow from the
rights responsibility you know it's not
the greatest thing in the world because
cows aren't super mean they're trying
not trying to go out of their way to
kill you but yeah
you know it's not the worst thing in the
world just from this perspective all
right
further down the road is pigs uh cows do
not actively
consume humans they might trample you
and they can eat you pigs will
absolutely fucking eat you
not under most circumstances but under
enough to where you realize pigs really
don't give a shit about human rights
right so why should we
now i'm not saying we shouldn't just in
this particular just this dimension of
right source of positive ability there
is not a good argument to be saving pigs
on this alone
and all the way down at the other end of
the spectrum are
you know is what is it what is so bad
about eating predators
okay so if you go down and make it
pretty simple you hunt an
alligator you shoot it with your own gun
or kill it with your bare hands
and you make jerky out of it you need
alligator jerky and a vegan walks by and
they're like how dare you
you're eating jerky you're like what's
alligator jerky and they're like that
animal had rights like
you did it though like as soon as i got
the opportunity would try to kill
anyone that knows including other
alligators by the way that are smaller
and definitely you you right there mr
vegan it would try to eat you it has no
regard for human rights as a matter of
fact it's a predator
it's an act of rights violator to
everything it sees around itself
so if you're saying you got to respect
the rights of beings that can respect
your rights back the alligator crocodile
etc komodo dragon get none of that so on
the right source possibility there's
probably
essentially nothing evil whatsoever
wrong with eating alligators
because they would eat you two in the
same situation you're just acting on
their love
right so that's what that is notice
lots of gray area number four
environmental effects
all right a couple of things and this is
where vegans gain a real big advantage
so it takes in order to raise livestock
for example
it takes more grain to feed livestock
that eventually goes to humans
than it would grain if just all humans
were vegan that step
of going from the energy density of
grain and feeding it into animals and
then feeding into ourselves that animal
step
wildly inefficient wildly inefficient
and requires
way more environmental degradation right
it takes up a ton of land area it
pollutes a lot more if we didn't have
animal agriculture there would be
significantly less pollution so
check super easy one for for the vegan
cause
factory farms specifically cause a good
deal of global
global pollution specifically depositing
carbon into the atmosphere
and uh you know some calculations
probably the best ones is like something
like a two percent two and a half
percent net carbon cost
per individual per capita so if someone
goes from being
a meat eater or just an omnivore to
vegan
they produce two to two and a half
percent per person per year
less carbon to contribute to
anthropogenic global warming
uh not the end of the world as global
warming is also not the end of the world
tldr
but definitely a net negative and you
know quite a big cost quite a bit cost
something definitely to think about
not life altering but definitely not a
great thing right
and lastly although i'm sure there's
many more other environmental points you
can make sort of justice
to illustrate this principle here
farming animals
can increase uh you know the occurrence
and spread of
zoonotic diseases significantly all
right so where do you guys think
coronavirus came from came from a
chinese lab man i swear to god the cia
is controlled by china had to say
it's it's those times still but in all
seriousness
even if coronavirus is somehow made by
chinese lab sure there's probably five
percent chance that happened
there's a ton of diseases we just get
from like agriculture and wet markets
and farming animals that we just
straight up
would never get if we never consumed
animals so right
that's definitely a thing however
however slightly
to the omnivore perspective is that
hunting animals especially ones that
tend to become overpopulated and get a
lot of disease going
hunting animals may actually be an
environmental plus
so hunting actually comes out pretty
good in this just scenario just for
environmental effects
so if we take a look at this on a
spectral perspective at the very
right hand uh corner of very very bad
are mega polluting and disruptive
factory farms and the delivery trucks
that take the meat
from the farm so slaughterhouses
slaughter house to store blah blah blah
blah
all very very bad very polluting very
bad for the environment
now if you take that factory farming and
this is already happening all the time
it could happen faster
and make it ultra modern then all of
that stuff is cleaned up significantly
you can take and still have factory
farming but make it much
more environmentally clean it is
absolutely possible it increases
slightly the cost of meat at the store
but for a very good reason
and as innovation continues to proceed
the cost of meat goes back down so it's
like a very short-term cost for a very
long-term benefit of not as much
pollution
so that is much less it's still bad
still have some pollution but much less
than with really like
just not giving a fuck type industrial
farming like sludge goes out and into
the river and you're like
whatever drop cigarette into sludge
forest fire
next are pasture-raised animals in
limited areas so clearly if you just
pasturize everything
some people have done the calculations
if we have pasture-raised animals but we
eat as much meat as the societies we do
today
like 90 percent of the earth's surface
is going to be pastures that means the
united fucking deserts are gone
you know uh marshes are gone rainforests
are gone
almost no diversity almost all the
species are dead real bad deal
but if you have a very small number
relatively speaking
small area farming and you have
pasturies and animals in limited areas
then the environmental effects are not
nearly as bad much much less than any
kind of industrialized attempt to farm
and then of course you have lab-grown
meat which has almost no
has no farming with it whatsoever it is
an industrial process so it does cost
some environmental cost
but much less of one and then at the
very other end
actually in the plus side is a
responsible hunting of excessive
populations
like i grew up mostly in michigan and in
michigan the deer
have like no fucking natural predators
because there's no more wolves
and no more bears and so the deer fuck
like animals
literally and then there's a shitload of
them and they just fucking run into cars
all the time they don't crash crazy
diseases overpopulation blah blah blah
and if you allow for deer hunting then
the deer are living in the natural
natural wild they're evolved to deal
with predators
so it's all fair in love and war and it
turns out that that's a net benefit for
essentially almost everyone involved
right definitely net benefit from the
environment to allow
responsible sustainable hunting so
there's there's the topography on that
all right number five this one's kind of
really esoteric so
follow along with me but it must be
stated
this spectrum is the life producing and
enhancing potential of an animal we
could potentially farm for food
so if you like life better than not life
then death or the absence of life then
you probably want to think a little bit
ahead and realize that in order to
preserve life
as much of it for as long as possible in
universal time
you want life to first of all survive
second of all in and have a really high
ability to survive in the future
diversify all kinds of different life so
if really that shit happens to one way
of living other ways of living can still
succeed like
fucking meteor toasted the dinosaurs but
small mammals were like fuck it we don't
need all this fucking sunlight anyway we
could just eat detritus for a while
until the shit clears up and then we'll
be ourselves bacteria etc etc
so there's a real good thing for
diversity here and expansion
expansion from one area to another like
animals that can
expand from one air to another are just
better for life as a whole than animals
that have just one little tiny specific
niche and
they go five feet one way or the other
they fucking die and then of course
expanding through continents
through the oceans all around the world
and in something that is uniquely human
to potentially other planets other stars
in the entire universe which almost
certainly
if we don't fucking kill ourselves here
on earth will happen right
only humans can do a couple of real cool
tricks which gives them a huge unique
advantage
to the argue of why it's especially bad
to try to farm people
and conversely why vegan arguments that
say why don't we just farm people
don't really hold a ton of water only
humans
can prevent earth-ending comets and
asteroids right any kind of animal other
than a human
when the comet is coming its ability to
do anything about it is is
the following that's it they look up and
go what the fuck
they might not even look up boom earth
is done
now humans can launch their nuclear
warheads you know
several you know hundred thousand miles
in advance they blew up right next to
the comet an asteroid
ping is it just enough of course we
never fucking worry about it again right
holy crap okay the mere existence of
humans
combined with thermonuclear weapons uh
extra atmospheric delivery capacity and
advanced targeting
is like the greatest thing that's ever
happened to planet earth as far as the
conservation of the biome because like
asteroids and comets are a big fucking
deal
and they're just really not nearly as
big of a deal anymore because humans
have the potential to detect them and go
fuck that we're not dying and blow it
out of the sky
big deal for all animals in all life
okay
next humans can prevent animals from
going extinct that are on the brink of
extinction
like if we just decide and a lot of
times we do this with a sheer audacity
of like what's cuddly and cute
like we decide that you know bald eagles
really like them they're on our fucking
flag or whatever
they're not on the american flag are
they they're in our american lore
we just don't want them to go extinct
you know people go and they
they take classes at a university and
extra credit as you go into a
conservatory and you feed baby eagles
with the pipette
and you train them and they fly off in
the wild and we can literally have saved
many species from extension of course
we've caused a ton of extinction too
but only because we are powerful enough
to do so we're also powerful enough to
save a bunch of animals
no other animal has that capability at
least willingly right
and the biggest one is humans are the
currently the only animal on earth
able to innovate to a sufficient degree
to eventually spread life to other
planets and stars
okay so when in maybe a hundred thousand
years you
like outside view of our galaxy you're
gonna be like oh my god there's
teeming with life humans did it humans
fucking did it
cows and pigs and chicken shirts fuck
didn't do that shit right
they're valuable in their own way but
they're not valuable in that way so
from the perspective of what has the
most life enhancing and life producing
potential
and also not just producing life but
enhancing it making
more happiness for example for other
creatures we can do a little bit of a
ranking a little bit of a spectrum so
here it is
if you kill elon musk and eat him for
food like people are saying like
super crazy left us to be like kill the
rich or eat the rich like
the rich are the most productive people
on the planet in a free society they
invent all
i don't want bill gates to get eaten
he's making microsoft excel i'm using
microsoft powerpoint to read the shit
right now i have nothing to do
and he goes who the fuck invented
youtube usually if we kill like sergey
brin or whatever who has google
there'd be no youtube it would be really
shitty forget all that elon musk may be
the guy or someone like him
to push us into the fucking stars to
colonize the fucking universe
eating him for food humongous waste of
potential
bad idea for life as a whole right
really bad idea
now what if you you know wander along
somewhere in some crazy
other country and you see someone like
killing puppies for food terrible thing
to think about
your first thought could be all
suffering and pain which is completely
valid but on this spectrum alone you
could be like man you know those puppies
would probably
provide a whole lot more happiness to
someone as a pet
than they would as a like a piece of
meat or something like that
like there's tons of other animals that
aren't particularly good as pets at
least these could provide more happiness
so killing puppies at least on that
regard
is a really really really terrible thing
not as bad as killing elon musk but
pretty bad
then we get into real murky territory
late term abortion when you commit late
term abortion
you have a fairly developed fetus then
you're essentially ending
a potential human life and that's you
know kind of a bad thing like
you want to avoid it as much as possible
because that person could have been born
and then become hyper productive and
help trillions of other people like
if bill gates was aborted the human
economy would be trillions of dollars
more contracted so he wouldn't have
microsoft excel and all this other
beautiful shit that he made
shit like that right early term abortion
not as bad
because that thing is not sufficiently
as developed and it doesn't have as much
life-creating potential because it's not
as well on its way
still you want to avoid it you know sort
of casually going around getting
abortions but not as bad as late term
abortion which is why most people
even when they're pro-choice they
they're not like yeah fucking
whatever it doesn't matter like most
people are like hey if i want an
abortion when should i get it
as soon as possible the earlier the
better and that's probably really good
advice on this spectrum alone
now if we go all the way down the end we
find that
if we have a situation in which we're
eating insects and crustaceans and maybe
most kinds of fish
you know that actually might make people
happier and more productive
because they like eating meat products
they like the higher protein diet
and it might actually expand human
civilization
marginally more that we reach for the
star sooner
and everything's super hunky-dory and
everyone's happy ever after
sooner and more profoundly and you
certainly can't say that like look
you know if you're eating crickets and
someone's like you know how dare you the
crickets have such a life-expanding
potential it's like they do
and are we running out of crickets like
are we making crickets extinct by eating
them hell no
so just on this perspective if you're
eating insects or eating bugs or eating
like shrimp and stuff like that
gee you're not really reducing
life-enhancing uh potential
almost any case especially if especially
if they're farmed because like if you
farm shrimp doesn't have dick to do with
the free
swimming shrimp they can go on and
evolve into other stuff but farm shrimp
kind of just like sort of
no upside no downside in that case
all right next some more meaty
philosophical stuff
the spectrum of self-directed freedom
one of the big arguments that you hear
from folks that are super pro-animal
rights to their credit
it would say things like well you
wouldn't want to be farmed for food
as a human and that's true and it's true
for many animals
but it's not exactly true that all
animals are equal in their desires
for freedom and self-direction for
example here's our spectrum
if you farm for food humans in their
prime
with goals and dreams and desires and
years of personal individual freedom
as a precedent for what they expect and
you grind them up for food
you're doing a real terrible thing on
the self-directed freedom and you're
robbing this is
terrible all right next worst thing just
as an example on the spectrum
is if you take like bald eagles which
are
condors like they have an effective
range of hundreds of miles they like to
do this shit they don't like to do
anything else they can fly around real
slow and look at stuff
if you take them motherfuckers and put
them in tiny little cages
they're gonna have a bad time of it like
not
human great suffering bad because not
that smart but bad
okay you are really robbing them of a
desire to be free
down a little bit is like lizards and
crocodiles
okay at least for some of these
subspecies it's pretty clear that if you
take a lizard
and you feed it enough food and you give
it a warm plate to sit on
and things around it smell pretty decent
compared to what it's used to
it can live in like a three by three
foot square not give a flying fuck it
doesn't want to go anywhere
like that yearning does a cabin fever
that you get it doesn't get it this is
no analog to that
all it needs is basic desires met and
it's good to go it's good to go
like us thinking that it wants to roam
is like an alien giving you this pseudo
environment this matrix environment
where you get to live for like
quadrillions of years and you get to
have sex with anyone you want and
all the riches in the world and just
live happiness for forever way longer
than you normally would
and the aliens other aliens are looking
at that and be like i can't believe
you're fooling that person
you know like they want to be out
creating algorithms to expand the
universe into a hyper-intelligent
machine
like do they really like most people
don't even know what that means
sure as hell if you even explain it
they're like fuck that i want to live in
fucking paradise these aliens are
putting me in paradise
so for like a lot of like sort of more
primordial creatures like crocs and
lizards and stuff like that
some of them are on that tail end where
like if you give them enough food and
uh just let them sit on something warm
or like swim around a little bit
they're rocking gold and they have no
more going for them they're not
interested anymore and they wouldn't be
able to understand what that means
further down are insects like insects
fundamentally the insect nervous system
in many cases
is like what you can call an automaton
like there's no self-reflection there's
no ego there's no desire there's really
no drive
they're just like input output machines
like in the very simplest sense of the
word
if we eat them for food we're not
robbing them or their freedom they don't
have a concept of freedom they have no
appreciation for it there's no analog
for it it's
just not a thing it's just not a thing
so taking this whole thing together
you can start to see like okay farming
pigs and cows and stuff like that's
pretty bad but not as bad as like if we
were farming bald eagles and not nearly
as bad as if we were farming human
beings
take that for what it is just by itself
for now
number seven suffering of bystanders
okay it causes a lot of people a ton of
psychological pain to know that animals
are being killed on moss
right i mean it's definitely something
to consider if you're compassionate
it should bring you no joy to know that
right now there's an
industrial grade slaughter of pigs and
cows and all these other animals
unreal insane conditions it's not
hurting you personally
but holy shit is it fucking evil
that's definitely a thing and if you're
saying hey look you can be vegan if you
want but just let me eat my meat
it's it's it's really fucked up because
it's like saying like hey look like you
know
like let me have my own little holocaust
to people i hate don't you worry you
know you like
people at your own i'm never gonna come
after your people i just wanna you know
have my own people to torture and kill
like
what like i know you have those people i
stay awake at night thinking about how i
can fucking kill you and rescue them
so this is definitely a bad deal right
but again there is also a spectrum here
let's take example of the spectrum so
the pain of losing a lifetime dearest
loved one
even if they clear all the other
spectrum uh all the other spectrums is
is pretty bad
okay really really bad about as bad as
it gets tons of suffering
it's not just an animal if you think
about like how bad do i feel
if a pig dies right now i don't know i
don't know that pig it's not a human
but if it's a human and you know who
they are and you love them for your
whole life and then they die like farm
for food
holy shit as bad as it gets even if
you're not the one that killed them even
if you're not responsible
that's really really bad it's not your
pain you're not the one being killed
they are but just that psychic pain of
knowing that that's happening to them
super terrible
next on the list as an example is the
pain of having to uh you know eat your
pet
right and uh um you know there's
examples in the american
farming history where like a child would
get attached to a pet pig
and sort of doesn't know maybe age seven
or eight that that pig's gonna end up
being next year's bacon
and at some point they realize that's
the case and like holy fucking shit like
bacon does not taste the same
if it's your friend the pet pig not as
bad as if it was like your dad
but like really really bad still really
really bad
down the list is knowing that factory
farm exists and knowing what they do
and amplified the fact that the
scale of the slaughter so insane as far
as numbers of animals
gee you know from an individual
emotional perspective the average
person's probably more hurt by eating
their own pet pig
than conceptualizing that like millions
of pigs die a year
so just from a human suffering
perspective i would probably still place
the eating of your pet as
more and more insane and more intense
but there's definitely something to be
said like if you really think it through
and this is where tons of vegans have
excellent points like a lot of people
are not vegan and they know what's going
on they're not
they're totally understanding of what it
is they're sort of complicit in
but some people just never thought about
it like you do realize right now
millions of animals are dying for your
dumb ass to sit and be like i love pork
and if you're like yep i thought that
through and on the trade-off i'm fine
with it but respect i'll shake your hand
but a lot of people are like oh my god
oh my god i can't fucking do this and
it's total respect that's a perfectly
fine way to go
right on the other end there are people
that are so
kind of insanely pro-animal rights it's
just not making any more sense
so some people uh think that wearing
even fake fur not real fur
things that look like fur it makes them
feel icky inside because it looks enough
like real fern reminds them enough of
death and suffering
that they think fake fur should be
illegal gee whiz you know
that doesn't exactly tug at the
heartstrings of most people now it's
totally understandable if you feel like
that
total respect but it's not going to be
the most convincing argument you can
ever tell anyone so if you are an animal
rights activist
i probably would start at saying look
let's just talk about how it would feel
to get your pet pig killed
you can now imagine that times 10
million a year or something like that i
wouldn't start with like
what's up with that fake fur you're
wearing you you fucking carnist
cocksucker and be like
okay what and even it's not real it's
not real like well it looks like it's
real and it's honoring a history of
slaughter you're like okay you're really
stretching it shit here right
so that's the spectrum can be really
very nominal non-suffering that
exaggerated for a comedic effect
all the way up to like super super
intense shit okay
all right next up number eight this
one's really straightforward
rarity and conservation okay there's
value and not killing off entire species
of animals if for nothing else then
scientific purposes of just knowing they
exist studying them and
sort of admiring all the beautiful
taxonomy of nature
so on that note like if you're hunting
and eating bald eagles
and they're fucking endangered what the
fuck that's insane
don't do that right um if you're really
pro-farming
a lot of farming pastures really
displace forests and marshes and other
uh sort of ecosystems of wildlife and
they just by proxy kill a fucking
shitload of animals probably leading to
a shitload of extinction
not as bad as just outright going after
the endangered species and killing them
and eating them like you know what
happened with the dodo essentially
but really really fucking bad in the
grand scheme and then all the way down
to eating farmed insects
okay like if we're eating if we have
farms set up to
uh you know allow for essentially the
manufacture of grasshoppers and we eat
the grasshoppers
or crickets you know if you say like
that's fucked up man
you know don't you want to conserve
crickets to be like are we fucking
running out of crickets are we running
out of bugs
are there not enough crickets in the
wild that were worried about farming
them to extinction
insane so on that note eating farm
insects looks pretty good
and eating bald eagles looks pretty bad
and everything in between looks
some somewhere in between
number nine yeah believe it or not we're
training your nutrition channel this
only gets one slide
is nutrition to be very particular
infants and young children
almost certainly need some animal
protein if it does not come from
a mother's breast milk then it probably
has to come
from usually animal derived baby formula
so making entire society vegan
difficult possible with some
technological advances but certainly
tough
certainly tough however for the rest of
us
human adults with just a moderate
inconvenience and i'm going to take some
supplements and counting some macros and
micros
you can probably get the same health the
same performance the same everything and
never eat meat again
and essentially suffer zero health and
performance consequences right
now if you have seafood and fish
then you can get ultra high quality
protein and really really healthy animal
fat
very easily and hint wink wink it also
ranks really low on animal suffering and
a ton of the other spectra
because it's just not the same as eating
like a pig with 50 trillion different
emotions
you're eating a shrimp i subsume it has
few if any emotions at all probably no
emotions at all
right so on nutrition the vegan argument
is great
but i don't want you to think that i'm
saying the vegans won that argument
what i want you to think is if you think
you have to eat like dead bleeding cows
bullshit you don't have to fucking do
that and if you think you have to go
vegan and you get all these nutritional
benefits that are special
also not true there's nothing special
about being vegan you can be just as
healthy being not vegan
and a very interesting trade-off for
really really optimizing
health and the morality of the situation
on all the other spectra is like eating
seafood and fish seems to be a pretty
good middle ground
pretty good middle ground lastly and i
do mean lastly because this is by far
the least ranked thing
when i start saying it you probably tend
to agree is taste and enjoyment
okay almost everyone has the desire to
eat meat it is a human universal termed
meat hunger it has its own term
okay you can just be regular hungry and
you can be meat hungry where they feed
you and
you get as much bread and beer and
veggies as you want and then you're like
i want fucking meat
even vegans have this which is by why
vegan cuisines
often have fake meats that are designed
to replicate the texture and taste of
meat
okay really illustrating that humans did
co-evolve with eating meat substantially
right which is
probably pretty much settled science at
this point another thing is that global
cuisines
thai food japanese food you name it
italian food you know burmese food
dot dot dot dot um they rely
very heavily on animal products in
almost every case
and if we just zap make the world vegan
tomorrow it would upend a lot of that
cultural inheritance significantly like
coming up to italian grandma would be
like no more meatballs grandma use fake
meat she'd be like what the fuck
hey small concern but it sure makes
grandma pretty sound all right
again very small concern in the relative
scheme good news is
fake meat vegan products are getting
better and better like the impossible
burgers
as i've been told very very good i look
forward to trying one at some point
and almost undifferentiable from meat as
far as at least
a lot of people say maybe not everyone
but it's getting better all the time
and again seafood seems to dodge a whole
a bunch of problems here because there's
probably a lot
very few downsides of eating seafood and
fish as far as any of the other vegan
concerns
but tons of cultures rely heavily on
seafood and fish and can continue to
have their beautiful cultural
history and expression of modern cuisine
okay so big list of listing
all 10 of these concerns and sort of
giving like a really one phrase quick
assessment of how it stacks up in the
grand architecture and don't you worry
we have two more slides
where we'll be breaking this down a
little bit and leading to some
conclusions
so number one pain and suffering
anything above
a fish like chickens cows pigs dot dot
dot
anything more advanced than fish is is
pretty bad okay uh
and remember again there's a spectrum
here up to if you think of it in certain
ways
terrible okay at least pretty bad if
you're
really really sort of like unemotional
about it you're like yeah like
logically it's pretty bad to kill all
those things that have feelings and if
you're really emoting you're like this
is the worst thing that's ever happened
and you may not be wrong
okay so at least very bad political
precedent
there's no bad political precedent for
meeting animals it's only bad a few
humans
there's a pretty clear line in the sand
there so that is what it is
it just renders the arguments that what
if it was people you're eating pretty
much null and void because there's not
really an effective comparison because
animals don't have sort of
self-integrated societies
rights reciprocity uh pretty bad if the
animals are cuddly
like not terrible but also like why are
we killing cuddly animals that would
never hurt us
uh only very very bad if human and
some other um sort of or animals that
are around humans
can be trained relatively well to offer
considerable rights reciprocities for
example dogs
like dogs can be trained really well
slash are genetically oriented to
actually respect a significant amount of
human rights
like if you have a bulldog
there's a very low chance it's going to
be biting or hurting anyone and there's
it probably would feel really bad if it
did that
uh that comes close to some sort of real
deep maybe not understanding of but
emoting about rights reciprocity
right a bulldog knows if it steals
something you did a bad thing something
like that so like if we're eating dogs
for food holy fucking shit that is
especially bad
probably worse than eating like cows or
pigs for food certainly cows
because they probably don't have that
level of deep connection with humans
right so that is what it is
number four environmental effects
factory farms are really bad
the rest is probably something like you
know huge pastures are probably pretty
bad
but like hunting and a very very modern
industrial farming techniques are
probably okay probably okay in that
respect life producing and enhancing
potential
is only really bad in most cases if
we're talking about humans so
another big human animal split as there
was in the political precedent
discussion
next one is self-directed freedom if you
have an animal that has a large range
animal like it prefers to be free and go
around
a huge range if you limit it to a range
smaller than that you're doing a bad
thing
and for sure definitely humans apply to
that but some animals are
it does not apply to right some animals
are
for the most part just don't give a shit
if they're confined to a relatively
small space
bystander suffering very easy bad for
vegans for sure animal rights activists
and
just normal people who care like myself
for example
raritan con conservation does not apply
to almost any farming directly
like you know pigs are not going out of
uh they're not there's no extinction
risk for pigs precisely because we farm
them at least in some
respect uh really bad for danger species
and there's a lot of downstream
consequences for mega industrialized
farming and pasture
that makes a lot of species exciting so
it's actually pretty bad for a lot of
shit
right so directly farming of pigs
doesn't cause this indirectly it causes
a shitload of them
nutrition for most in most cases there's
no need to eat meat
but there's also not a huge harm uh in
one way or another if some kinds of
meats like
you know insects and shrimp and
crustaceans and potentially even some
fish
taste and enjoyment meat wins but not by
much
and in 10 or 20 years a lot of meat like
products
hopefully laboratory grow meat will be
up there anyway
but even if it's not a lot of meat like
products taste damn close to meat
and this is like number 10 let's be
honest is a fucking frivolous concern
like you know for like destroying the
lives of you know giving birth to and
then destroying lives like 10 million
pigs a year or some shit
where it's very difficult to justify
that just unlike i just like how they
taste
like alone by itself good god that's
tough in concert of all these other
things maybe not as tough but certainly
number 10 is not a standalone argument
for eating meat in most cases
all right so how does all of this add up
where do we stand because we just
blabbed philosophical and scientific for
a real long time what the fuck is it
that we actually discovered
a couple of things these are sort of
what i extract from it you may extract
very different things and if you do
please let us know in the comments
and in if you someone says in the
comments something you don't like or you
don't disagree with you want to know
more about it
please feel free to at least hopefully
politely address their concerns there's
been enough yelling
and calling people assholes about this
for like i don't know decades we could
probably do a little better than that
so if you go vegan you check
almost all the boxes or all the boxes in
that whole list of 10 things
and that's fucking awesome and i
encourage you to do so
i think if you don't care one way or
another for any other reasons if you're
vegan or not go vegan
it's fucking sweet like the vegans won
this one they fucking won
and when lab grown meat comes around
your boy is going vegan too
and everyone should because it's fucking
sweet first of all you get to eat shit
made out of a lab
that's cool because it's all science and
shit you feel like dolphin rendering
from rocky iv
and also it's just super convenient
great environmental benefits
no suffering all the way down the line
now
if you don't quite want to go vegan if
you eat
from insects up through fish inclusive
so including the crustaceans and shrimp
and crab and stuff like that
you're probably doing almost no harm in
any one of these categories including
pain and suffering because most these
animals probably don't experience
anything like pain and suffering
and so this is a huge step forward so if
you're like dude i want to go vegan but
god damn it sushi's good you're fucking
golden just eat sushi
and eat plenty of fish and all the
shrimp and all this other stuff but you
know if you can
find it in your heart or in your tastes
preferences and desires to avoid eating
pigs and cows and chickens and shit like
that
then this is huge it's not like if a lot
of vegans make a huge mistake of this
not all but a lot
of like you know they watch you eat
shrimp and they're like you fucking
asshole like look
way better than eating chickens and cows
and pigs especially pigs and chicken
pigs and cows were quite emoting super
smart very social
so if you can just eat um you know all
the way up to fish and down all the way
through insects
man you're doing an awesome awesome
thing huge step forward so if you can't
find it in your heart
to just cut out meat completely then
this is a really really awesome step i
highly encourage now this surprise
surprise at least some of you
maybe not most especially if you've been
paying attention if you hunt
uh animals that we sort of have
designated as not
likely to become extinct and naturally
overpopulate anyway
then you're very morally defensible so
if you go upstate and
shoot a deer and bring it back and make
venison out of it and eat it all bloody
uh the most hardcore vegans in almost
all cases if they're
being intellectual about it and have
followed through this whole thing they
should be like yeah
word up that seems fine right that deer
is gonna fucking die anyway
it could die from like a hobbling nasty
10-day illness where
fucking finally like various critters
just eat it from the inside out
fucking terrible or you know at the
prime of its life it could get fucking
zapped with one bullet never feel a
thing and then
make some other people happy with its
body pretty uh
pretty morally defensible in my view um
just don't hunt
endanger species for the fucking love of
god right like so
hunting like upstate nebraska shooting
deer fucking sweet
shooting pigs fucking sweet if you like
post instagram pictures yourself like
some people have
in the last couple of years like ultra
rich cocksuckers like i'm in africa
hunting a fucking giraffe like what the
fuck is wrong with the giraffes are
fucking barely
alive there's most of them are in zoos
and you're out there fucking killing one
like what is it that you get out of this
whole process
fucking leave the giraffes alone hunt
animals that don't have a population
problem that's probably a pretty good
start and in fact very morally
not just neutral but possibly even
morally defensible like a good thing
like you're making sure that animals
don't overpopulate get crazy diseases
and all that stuff which is actually
really good
now if you eat beef pork chicken etc
you're doing quite a bit of harm if
you're cool to just take that morally on
the face
respect okay so you can't walk around
really
being an intellectual and being like man
fuck it like i'm not doing any harm
you're doing a shit a lot of harm
shit a lot of harm what you can do
if you're not if you're totally cool
with doing harm hey listen at least
you're speaking it out loud
if you're not cool with doing so much
harm you can do some things and
still hang on to eating chickens pigs
and cows
and other animals like that consider
purchasing from slash advocating for
more humane
and environmentally friendly farming
conditions right this is a really big
thing that can make a
huge impact and actually bring you very
close
to veganism on the sort of total moral
calculus here
like especially if the animals grow up
happy
they're given medicine so that they
don't die of really nasty diseases they
wouldn't have
in the wild they're fenced off and
guarded from predators because predators
fuck animals in the ass all the time in
the wild
and they grow up happy and around their
friends and at some point they're just
slaughtered very humanely fuck man
that's like maybe a net good
all right so you can just continue to
eat those animals and be morally like
shake vegan's hands and be like we're
not doing any harmed animals
we're keeping them safe we're keeping
them you know away from predators
keeping them healthy and then at the
sort of prime or edge toward the end of
their life
we you know very humanely slaughter them
they don't have to go through any
super crazy shit as far as like you know
like losing a hoof and fucking walking
around on a half bloody stump for like
three months and just losing body weight
until you eventually die that's how
nature works by the way folks nature's
fucking awful
uh maybe it's not a bad thing at all so
the quest for veganism is a very very
morally righteous one but doesn't have
to be the only quest
you if you really care about animal
suffering which is a good idea to care
about
you can do a lot by simply buying the
kind of products
that are noted to be like farmed in a
sustainable and very ethically
ethically sourced food is a real good
idea and even if you want to go to the
level of
saying you know because animals can't
advocate for themselves maybe we should
have a legal system that advocates for
them
then maybe that's a consideration as
well so maybe we could have a set of
laws in the eu
or the united states that says look you
can hunt everything you fucking want as
long
as it's not uh you know endangered and
if you're gonna farm you have to meet
these
basic criteria of you know at least
don't fucking make the animal's lives
miserable
and then maybe we're off to a real real
real good start and possibly even that's
as good as it gets
right it's so good in this case we can
do so much good by changing the way
we're farming and trading animals
that it turns out most arguments against
eating meat that is to say most
arguments for veganism
just lose most of their steam if cruel
factory farming is out
or changes to be not cruel then a lot of
veganism arguments really just
don't hold much merit anymore if
you care about animal welfare
and the welfare of the planet as an
ecosystem a lot
and you really want to do the most good
i would recommend in my analysis of
what's going on
for you to put as much resources you are
capable or interested in putting into
into advocating for humanizing right
making more humane
and cleaning up reducing the
environmental impact
of factory farming first that's where
you can do the most good
so if you have a spectrum of what you
can do to help animal suffering and help
the planetary ecosystem
advocating for factory farms to change
their processes to become
way more humane and way less polluting
is probably one of the best
uses of your time if you really give a
shit and think it through not just feel
it through
and like all the way in the end is like
a famous actress walks out on a fur coat
from like a lamborghini purchasing area
like a lambo dealership
and you like squirt fake blood on her
fur coat and ruin it you fucking meteor
scumbag
like you're really just entertaining
yourself
you're emoting it feels good to be
righteous but what you're accomplishing
is just people fucking hate you more and
then they think vegans are insane people
and they hate them
anytime vegans are like hey i have some
good points and there's a video it says
youtube video vegan convinces blah blah
and they're like i'm not going to click
on that vegans are nuts
right so if you're in that in that camp
you say you care about animals a lot
but you're doing something that has
maybe a net negative effect
on animal welfare and on the ecosystem
of the planet
whereas if you start to intelligently
advocate and as a consumer to other
people and to corporations
try to demand with your dollars better
factory farming conditions that are way
more humane less factory farms more open
ranges and inner constraints
and of course less environmental
pollution
then you're doing a really really
awesome thing that really helps them i
know this is like
a technical thing and it's more of like
voting with your dollars and voting with
your ballots and less like squirting
blood in people's faces
it doesn't feel gutterly as good but
remember you're a human being you have
the ability to think as well as to feel
and you can choose to do better by
thinking a bit more
and understanding that while your
feelings have a ton of validity how
action really happens how change really
best happens
is through your logic not just through
your emotions folks
holy crap that's a whole lot if you hate
