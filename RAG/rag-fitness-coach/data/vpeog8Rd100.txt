When we think of the size of a muscle, 
we often base it on its outer appearance.
However, muscles are 3-dimensional 
and occupy space within the body.  
Therefore, volume is a much better 
measurement of a muscle's true size.
This study explored the volumes 
of the upper body muscles.
Unexpectedly, the deltoids are 
the largest upper body muscle,  
with the triceps a close second. Surprisingly,  
both the deltoids and triceps are larger than 
the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.
