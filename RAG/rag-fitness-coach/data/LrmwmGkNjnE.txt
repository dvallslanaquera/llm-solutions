more commonly known as rp strengths i

what got me started on the path to
working in the fitness career
probably goes back to high school
and just loving the idea of training
i got introduced to weight training from
my older brother we had
some weights in our basement they were
the plastic ones with sand and them
of course and you know i have a older
brother
that's four years older than me and he's
bigger and stronger than me of course so
i watch him training and
i want to train i want to you know i
want to be like him or whatever
and that kind of was my first taste of
it and it was fun
ironically most people looking back when
they see me now they're like oh you
played football too and i say
no actually believe it or not i was a
runner so i ran
cross country i ran track and yeah i
wasn't very good
the summer between my freshman and
sophomore year we were we were told that
we had to run 100 miles that summer
i was the only person that summer that
actually hit the hundred mile
total and the first day of practice my
sophomore year
i was up running with all the top guys
from the previous year
and it was just a brainstorm that went
off and said oh
well if i work really hard and do what
other people aren't going to do
i can be successful and so i went to
university of michigan
sport management was my path of choice
there and that's actually where i met
this fine gentleman dr mike isrtel and
we started chatting he said hey you're a
pretty good athlete
you should come out and join our
powerlifting club and i did
and i did my first powerlifting meet
with really no
serious training maybe like a month
before and i was pretty much just hooked
after that again i just got back to that
mindset where hey you know if i just
really work hard and commit to it
i can do some pretty cool things and you
just keep working hard you keep building
upon what you have been doing and if you
keep that up over
months and years you're gonna have some
cool results
my first job in the fitness industry was
working as a
personal trainer in new york city it was
great
you're 21 22 year old right out of
college living in manhattan
having fun we all train together we all
live together
got to train and work with just some of
the
brightest smartest most
capable people in literally the entire
world
so it's just really cool to interact
with those people and just be able to
help them a little bit in their journey
and that's what really got me started
the very beginning stages of rp i guess
formed from running my own little
private training company just myself
training folks around the city and i
quickly realized
that my time wasn't very efficient if
i'm having to travel
downtown and then across town and all
the way it started
it wasn't super scalable and it just
wasn't the most efficient use of
one person's time and so dr
mike was working with a lot of clients
online
and we were sort of referring folks back
and forth a lot
we said why don't we just join forces
here
and that was this transition
from doing everything in person to
online coaching and again online
coaching is a little bit more efficient
more scalable with one individual's time
so instead of you know one hour you're
only with one person
you might be able to write three or four
diets over the course of one hour
and that was kind of this this eye
opener and this goes back to probably
about 2013 or 2014.
so again it was all online coaching for
a couple years and 2014
it was hey we we have to create products
and we came out with our first ebook in
october of 2014
and again you know let's just say we had
50 clients a piece
well the first week that we released
this ebook i think it sold like a
thousand copies
and again that's just one of these
revelations you know i want to say that
oh wow okay well this is a lot more
scalable and so we saw that
it was successful and then from there is
this
realization that well now one product
did well well how do we take this online
coaching model how do we package that
and how do we scale it
and so you know mike had this idea well
hey i think i can do this via templates
i said all right great
february 2015 is when we release our
first ever
rp diet templates 1.0 clunky
ugly excel files we didn't again we we
didn't have these huge goals for we have
to sell
1 000 of it wasn't anything like that it
was
let's create this product we know it's
going to work the model in the system is
proven
it was well received but it wasn't until
about three months after we released
them
around the spring of 2015 people started
posting their results
online from using these excel diet
templates
and then again with social media now
instagram was starting to become a
little bit more of a thing
facebook was still really popular of
course people started seeing this they
started inquiring like
what the heck did you do to get these
awesome results they saw that and they
go all right well i can buy these diet
templates for a hundred dollars
versus paying online coaching five or
six hundred dollars it's like a
no-brainer it's like well
let me try these more and more people
started to use them
and again it just it was like a snowball
effect and then it really started to
expand and that was again another one of
these
you know just big eye openers that that
was kind of now the clear path for rp to
take
[Music]
so one of the biggest regrets early on
was again this mindset of
you're not quite big enough to where you
can hire in a ton of help
even though that is the right course of
action to take because the more
personal time you spend in the business
you can't
spend it on growing the business and so
looking back there was never a night
where we went to bed
before every single email was answered
or applied to
but there's only so much in so long you
can do that where you're just working
essentially around the clock
and so we started getting more help
and so our time was better spent doing
other things to help grow the company
[Music]
rp is general philosophy my personal
philosophy on customer service is
it has to be a huge priority everything
we do
now in the social media age
you can't treat people badly so if we
are seeing negative feedback or anything
like that
we're gonna we're gonna handle it and
we're gonna try to do everything that we
can to the best of our abilities to
to make it right it's absolutely a huge
priority for us
you can't you can't overlook it
rp's biggest accomplishment to date it's
just the ability to help
as many people as we've had because we
were able to scale things and help
create digital products
this the vast number of people that
we've been able to help has expanded
into the tens of thousands into the
hundreds of thousands
via the templates and now the app so
what's our best accomplishment well
i think of it only in one way in terms
of how can a
a person or company provide as much
value to other people as they can
and we've been very successful in that
and then we've been able to help you
know probably a couple hundred thousand
people
over the course of you know six seven
eight years so that would be my number
one
by far
i think training and business go hand in
hand
if you work really hard you do xyz
you get output abc well the same
sort of applies in business typically
the harder you work the better job that
you do again
think about all the emails that we
responded to over time that's setting
the foundation
and it's just this continual evolution
over time
you keep getting a little bit better
each day each week
and again a year from now it's
completely night and day
you have to be able to accept and take
criticism and feedback there's
literally no way around it especially in
the social media age
take in all the feedback and sort of
look at it objectively
detach step back don't get too emotional
about it which is really hard to do
there's always
room for improvement why don't i just
take it easy
so i mean that's a really good question
that just goes back to mindset
i'm addicted to the idea of
self-improvement
whether that's training whether that's
reading and learning
there's no end in sight there's no
there's not a finish line
like the the journey
is the journey the journey is the
struggle
that's just what it is again that goes
back to
uh my running days in high school that
goes back to being a bodybuilder and
being a power lifter that's just not in
my nature
i don't want to be average i don't want
to settle so why would
i kick back and relax it's just not
not in my dna
[Music]
everyone always wants the one hack the
one secret the one
shortcut the hack the secret the
shortcut
is there is no secret or shortcut
there is no hack it doesn't exist what
does exist
is just the mindset that you want to
continually get better
over time you want to keep pushing to
get better you want to
keep working hard you just you love the
the struggle you embrace it that
that is the secret if people want the
secret when it comes to getting leaner
to getting healthier to getting faster
getting stronger you name it there is no
secret
you have to work you have to work really
hard and guess what there's going to be
days where it sucks
it's not going to be fun you just got to
be disciplined and you just got to stick
with it and you just got to keep going
because we see that all the time
with what we do especially people want
that secret or shortcut to
how do i lose 20 pounds and get leaner
and get stronger well
get to work
