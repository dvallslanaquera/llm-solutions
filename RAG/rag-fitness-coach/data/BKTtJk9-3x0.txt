if you want an amazing workout with just
a pair of light dumbbells you're gonna
have to get creative you can make these
workouts Ultra fast it will be tough
let's get to the workout
[Music]
this whole workout is going to be a sum
total of 10 exercises two sets each that
is 20 cents we are going to be able to
finish this workout and so will you at
home in less than 20 minutes how is that
possible
science time
antagonistic or unrelated supersets we
do a set of an exercise that involves
one muscle group
or a few muscle groups and then with no
rest at all we transition into the next
set of an exercise that uses ideally
none of the muscle groups we just use so
while one of your muscle groups or a few
of them are really tired and recovering
the other ones are still training and
getting hammered after those two sets
are done right back to back with
essentially no rest we give Nick maybe
30 seconds or a minute rest to catch his
breath and then he goes again it's not
going to take long the only well
downside like we mentioned before
Aim so let's get to the first exercise
superset that we have ready let's hit it
let's go
[Music]
let's get to the first exercise superset
that we have which is dumbbell Skull
Crushers superseted to dumbbell
stiff-legged deadlifts the stiff-legged
deadlifts if the glutes the hamstrings
the lower back some adductors basically
a huge part of your leg and back and the
skull crusher is really just mostly
triceps and a little bit of your front
delts so there's no interference there
so you're going to go right from one to
the other and for some normal Nuance
here we're doing the Skull Crushers
first because the stiff legged deadlifts
are harder we're going to be tired by
the time we get to the stiff legged
deadlift then we can get a ton out of
Skull Crushers with the same dumbbells
and a ton out of stuff like a deadlines
push it there let's go finish strong
excellent nice and slow
big time let's go
yes and right over a quick transition
stiff legged deadlifts back Ultra arched
knees back chest up
beautiful
chest up
take a nice pause down there when you
get there
looking for that painful tension in the
hamstrings awesome
painful tension deep stretch chest up
pause
hit it
awesome great take 30 seconds and we'll
get right back to Skull Crushers
it's okay to be explosive on the ascent
of the rep it's kind of descent The
Eccentric phase
slow is good good stuff Nick finish
strong let's go big moves here
oh yeah
all right
right into stuff like a deadlift again
you guys can tell when this exercise is
working when you tilt your hips push
your butt back you are going to feel a
ton of painful tension in the hamstrings
you want that tension by moving your
knees back not locking them out just
keeping them a little shy of lockout
moving your hips back keeping your chest
up as high as possible with an arched
back that'll really Target the
hamstrings
oh yeah
all day long perfect
Mac superset is going to be dumbbell
upright rows super set it to dumbbell
split squats if you do your split squats
it's totally cool to do them on the
floor but if you have a little platform
for elevation it could just be you're
wearing a bigger shoes or something like
that you step on any kind of mats as
long as it's solid it gives you that big
glute stretch that helps you grow your
quads add our curse glutes even a little
bit of hamstrings the upright row hits
your side delts your traps your biceps
your forearms a little bit again whole
body but parts of the body that don't
interact so while one muscle is resting
the other one is being crushed
when you're doing these folks you want
to reach your elbows Sky High and come
down nice and slow because it's
dumbbells it's very unlikely to irritate
your shoulder joint if you want to go a
little wider or a little closer it's
your call whatever hits your side delts
a ton and allows you to have very
comfortable feel for your shoulder
joints good stuff Nick do your best to
slow them down slow
yes right into split squats
guys notice he's not slamming his knee
on the ground there's no rush to get
down there
we want slow and controlled to get the
muscles to work and for it to be nice
and safe finish up strong Nick let's go
look at that technique
beautiful
30 seconds to a minute rest and we're
right back in the game
good control that upper body posture no
swinging
slow
yes finish up strong
yes
every set pushed close to failure for
the challenge beautiful excellent guys
you want just the gentlest little touch
at the bottom and if you can hang there
for a second or two that's even better
get you that glute and quad muscle
growth that you are looking for
just with a pair of well 20 pound
dumbbells in this case you can use five
tens twenties and if you're super strong
30s and 40s why not
chest
yes awesome go ahead and rack let's take
a look at what we have next
Nick you're looking a little tired
looking like you're working
almost halfway good news it's time for a
break no wait I said that wrong by break
I meant You're Gonna superset standing
dumbbell curls to dumbbell front squats
good news the front squats don't really
require anything your arms do and vice
versa
but pain good you guys will notice that
Nick is curling all the way up to his
head slash face it is a way to curl it
is a great way to curl it is not the
only way to curl he could totally stop
about halfway up and it'll be a great
exercise variation is the name of the
game if you have a few different ways of
curling you can use one for a few months
one for another few months no wrong
answers
come on now finish up strong
excellent and slow
rate right let's get your feet on that
platform folks if you have the ability
to squat on heel shoes it's better if
you can do a platform like this that's
awesome because pointing his toes out a
little bit
staying as upright as he can he's only
securing the dumbbells on his shoulders
the weight is going through his
shoulders entirely you'll notice his
torso is as vertical as possible and
that he's only coming up two-thirds of
the way that means the tension remains
on the quads the entire time and we get
a ton of exposure to that lengthened
position at the very big stretch at the
bottom these squats are killers awesome
slow on the way down big pause at the
bottom perfect good stuff minute or so
30 seconds we'll be back in action
excellent nice and slow full range of
motion grass and reach back at the
bottom stretch those biceps
finish up strong Nick let's go a couple
more
go go go go and then slow as if you're
gonna do another
full good
[Music]
oh yeah a couple more
ah
[Music]
oh yeah
last one big chest
go awesome amazing I think I'm one of
them I stood up a little bit further
it's really hard not to yeah
number four superset coming up getting
to the end here Nick is nice and tired
but he's still with us we are going to
be doing a dumbbell pullover two-arm
superseted two dumbbell chest flies
we're taking care of our lats some
tricep some of the delt muscles as well
as of course the pecs I'm gonna support
muscle on the body with the Flies make
you ready to go yep let's do it all
right we want to go nice and slow on the
way down on the pullover
really let your rib cage expand open up
as you go down you're going to feel a
deep stretch on the back of your arm in
the tricep the back of your shoulder as
well as your lat muscles on the outside
of your back
you'll see Nick is taking a nice long
pause at the bottom of every rep that's
where the growth is if you can take a
pause and a muscle stretched position
when it's under load
that is going to confer a lot of muscle
growth
slow controlled
and that's it come up all right right
into flies Nick is going to have just a
slight elbow angle
very similar angle the entire time that
he's doing these flies as he goes down
he's going to reach up with his chest
you want to feel a major stress a major
stretch in the pecs the entire time that
you're doing this and you'll notice he
goes down slow as usual and takes a nice
pause at the bottom this makes the
exercises safer and more effective
yes finish awesome
relax and we'll hit it again
[Music]
ah
it's still alive
but barely ready for the last combo last
one all right all right
last few sets here
Nick is going to do push-ups
and he's gonna do
as many as he can with good technique
regular push-ups hitting the chest front
delts and triceps and then he is going
to do rows to the hips dumbbell bent
over as he's going to bend over he's
going to have a big stretch at the
bottom and he's gonna bring the
dumbbells up to his hips hips hips
activating his lats it's gonna be
awesome this rounds out our whole
program and it turns out we trained
every single muscle in the human body
except for the calves because who cares
about calves just kidding or not see you
guys in the comments
he is pausing gently at the bottom
only good technique here folks
save the bad technique for never
Nick finish up
[Music]
yes last one
go
go finish amazing
you guys will want a nice flat lower
back here makes lower back rounds a
little bit at the bottom that's totally
fine but at the top it's nice and arched
he's reaching forward a ton and
protracting his scapulae
there's a ton of back muscle that allow
that movement to occur and resist it and
that's why they grow big if you do it
excellent
finish up Nick
hips yes and then slow amazing
awesome about a 30 second break here and
then we're gonna finish off the whole
thing
[Applause]
[Music]
I was tired phenomenal job I'm just
lucky I didn't have to do this I could
pretend to be the instructor
excellent work how'd that feel uh very
intense I mean 20 pound dumbbells you
don't think too much about it but just
go go go go go go go go it's a really
good way to add intensity without having
to get crazy heavy
you only have a few dumbbells at home
and a few other things you can have
amazing workouts you can do this by
yourself no problem if you download the
RP hypertrophy app link in the
description it's going to be easier more
effective and you're going to have a
total plan you know exactly what to do
with every single time folks thanks so
much for tuning in best of luck
