ah
hey congrats on doing three reps of your
uh hex squat and then nine body weight
squats let's go here
response with mumbling
[Music]
youtube hello
i am dr mike insertal
and
this
is
john hack
this is andy huang
they are
monumentally stupendously ludicrously
absurdly insanely
psychopathically strong even
stupid strong yo that's dummy strong do
people say that i said it and i almost
look like a person
so
here's the thing they are here visiting
the renaissance gym we just did a little
app commercial bs you guys will see that
downstream at some point maybe you
already have
but
now it's workout time here's the thing
andy's like
just
paint me like one of your
whatever girl what was it french girls
yes i have seen titanic and i cried
just kidding i've actually never seen it
because movies in which people die at
the end that are main characters i don't
watch though because i don't
intentionally make myself i can do
humans crying like dogs crying oh
absolutely not no no
i refuse to watch it why would you watch
a movie like that in any case
andy's like just do whatever to me my
body is your temple and so he's going to
be doing him inside me
youtube algorithm youtube it's all a
joke baby we're just jokes
things will happen come will occur
uh he's gonna do some smith machine good
mornings and then we'll see what kind of
hack spotting he's into maybe he will
struggle maybe he'll throw up maybe not
these guys are prepping for meat they're
way far out from the meat so we can have
a little bit of fun but not too much we
have to be responsible sports scientists
uh john is gonna be doing his own
working up to a single in the squat
which is gonna be how much weight um
probably like 675 for the low end maybe
like
low sevens yeah low sevens typical easy
squat single fucking insane asshole so
he's going to work up to a single there
and then he's going to do like one
little quad movement with us for fun
john hack hack squats
it just feels too right to ignore
sometimes the universe is like hey
and you're like what's up universe and
it's like yeah you're going to throt
blood so
maybe
one of the greatest lifters of all time
if you don't know who he is google him
good luck spelling his last name
it's more a's than you would think
and uh it's gonna be awesome we're gonna
hurt them but not too much because
they're very valuable it's like if you
rent a lamborghini you can you can gun
it but not too hard because then if you
break it that's a lot of money
insurance though yeah i don't i don't do
that insurance shit we should find out
whatever damn it
that's true
yeah but there are rp athletes so we own
them
you guys good yep let's go hell yeah
let's train
all right
andy has to hit hamstrings and quads
today this sort of assistance work
and we are going to do smith machine
good mornings
ysmith machine because it's here and we
can use it because
your boy
made a little duct tape modification
i assume it's a little difficult for you
to hold far close at this point since
you're fucking gigantic
so um
chocolate milk
in any case he's going to be doing a
probably a couple sets of eight here
working up in weight getting some good
technique going hitting hams i'll have
plenty of tips for you guys in between
um we'll hit that and then we'll hit
some probably some hack spots and that's
when the really the fun begins and fun
is a very relative term
let's get into it all right
i feel like you're appropriating my
culture with that redneck engineering
there
you mean lack of culture
is that possible to appropriate
slow
knees almost completely straight just a
tiny bend chest stop
and up very good two more
butt back slow chest up chest up chest
up
knees bent a little keep those knees
almost completely straight you want
tension in the hams
yes much better and up rack very good
super
[Music]
same bar speed as unloaded bar excellent
[Music]
break
the town's people free like frankenstein
the townspeople are against you and shit
it's just a monster
the regular strong guys in the village
are like it's not right woody
there's nothing christian about it
[Music]
slow
chest up
[Music]
slow good
a little lower
touch all the way down
too much knee bend

up
back
i held the bar on that and prevented the
rotation yeah yeah did you feel it are
you good no i didn't feel as good you
shoot my body next to yours no i didn't
you can get closer you guys will notice
that i was invading andy's personal
space
and was holding the bar like so
that's because he's gigantic as fuck and
it's really difficult to get under this
bar and not have it rotate down on you
when you get lower and that just he kept
clanking in so i just rotated it back
for him it's not like i was like helping
him do the shit
i mean i like to be as close to my
athletes as possible in coaching
but that's usually off camera
stop knees
yes up
two more
oh that's so good that's so fucking good
up
one more
big chest andy let's finish strong
stop
he's back chest up
up
hey can i get the audio from this
[Laughter]
for what purpose sir
you use a dub over every exercise you do
yes yes right there oh god it feels so
good oh god stretch it out
here straight
how much more do you want on there um
that's 55
yeah that's 655 so
you go seven
yeah
700
705 or 700.
what's 7.5 we got two and a half's and
everything
uh i'll go 705.
hey guys i'm champion powerlifter mike
isratel and in order to get this strong
i use elite
whey sup nutrition and um i uh drink
milk
and i i pray every night to god
drug free that's most important stay in
school don't use drugs
and uh you'll get strong just like me
your hero
like is ratel
elite power lefter
[Music]
you ever dumped before
dumped you ever dump a bar i usually go
over oh my man so i'm going to stay the
fuck out of that one yeah this is the
last single yeah
[Music]
nice and easy steady stable steady
stable
[Music]
take your time
[Music]
that was just you fighting bar whip for
a whole rep
yeah that was so much a web yeah
i picked up i was like
thank you good stuff man yeah
i was silent shot of fear in my
heart come on good god
how do you nut up for this kind of shit
does it scare you john trains alone a
lot and then his old job he traveled a
lot and he'd have to go and lift that
shit gyms and so he's really adapted
well so like if it was like something
where
i was traveling like this weekend
um but i wasn't coming like here with
like experience lifters i would have
done my lighter heavy squat on like
thursday and then died my lighter squat
day sure what's your lighter squat eight
thousand pounds
uh
no
i'm gonna do like pause squat so
i'm just starting out so i'll be like
500. okay now like
i don't know the last time i felt the
500 pound squat so yeah yeah hopefully
that'll never happen yeah
unbelievable very cool
um
that's it we take them off uh yeah like
normally i'd do downsets but
i'll just do we'll take care of all that
for you
[Music]
like that worked the work said after
this how
what can we expect no i'm not like six
six reps
and then
drop sets or
it's gonna be
rp on the six yes yes so uh the set
after this is going to be
an rpe compared to what you're used to
like a 12. so there's going to be
multiple times where you don't rack you
just rest for a few seconds and then you
go again okay it'll be the worst thing
you've ever done in your life thanks
yeah and then it'll happen again
afterwards but then that's it okay
so the guys are warmed up
andy did his hamstring work john did his
top set of 7000 in the squat or whatever
and now a little bit of volume the guys
want to know a little taste of medicine
a little rp medicine a little teamful
round bullshit so we're just going to do
two sets
of hack squats each set is going to be a
mile rep set one set is going to be a
little heavier 500 pounds said after
that depending on how the gentlemen feel
and if they're able to continue to walk
three or four plates three 400 pounds
and um buyer upset probably two or three
my rep pauses each one so we're not here
for a long time just a good time
and uh this is what bodybuilding volume
is like the guys are not trained for
this so here again it's fun to see power
lifters like them get super fucked up
but at the same time we have to be
mindful of you know like rabdo is a real
thing
and way too sore to train next time is a
real thing so we're gonna make the
training super fucking hard but we're
not gonna do a lot of it you know my
workouts for quads they're not two sets
they're six seven sets these guys has
two sets because they're just not used
to the shit they're way fucking stronger
than me but they're not used to this
sport specificity is a real thing let's
uh see how the cookie crumbles so to
speak
three
good let's get to six before we rest

next yeah we have a little tradition
here at uh renaissance gym oh shit a
last set of quad work is followed by
body weight squats oh fuck keep your
weightlifting shoes on so as soon as
you're done over there as quickly as
possible within reason come back here
facing this way
and you're going to put your heels
down on this like basically half your
foot on half off yeah and you're going
to stick your hands up like this and
jesus my quads are so sore i like
destroyed my quads yesterday
you're gonna slowly control
sit to full depth
and then come up and then go down as
quick as i say no waiting up here so
you'll come up it'll go down and you
just go right back down it's gonna be
fucking brutal don't go down fast or
slow and then come up and go down as
soon as i say oh shit we'll do as many
of those as it takes to uh
deliver the message so to speak two
two it is
sound good

the minimum number this is 400 so one
plate less

get 15 reps at least 15 1 5.

clicks
yeah it's just you know anything you do
over time you get good at yeah
folks
andy huang john hack they came in
they did
everything super well
super technically proficient
even on the bodybuilding stuff they
tried and they insisted on sitting down
for this outro because standing's not
really in the cards what do you guys
think how'd you feel
i enjoyed it more than i thought i would
yeah i was i prepared myself for the
worst that way yeah can't get any worse
in my head
but it wasn't that bad but really went
through like
one-tenth of what mike really does so
yeah
i'm not really that much uh impressed by
what i did but happy it's over yeah i
enjoyed that it's a it's a different
kind of challenge than powerlifting um
for us it's more so about like
beating the nerves of getting under such
a heavy weight versus this is like
digging deep to push for more reps
why is your voice sound all funny
um
i don't know he's out of oxygen yes
basically you guys see elevation in
michigan yes the elevation is crazy high
here thank you so much for coming on
down
and awkwardly i'm behind you talking to
you so yeah
oh yeah yeah that's right
all right gentlemen it's been real
youtube tell us what you want uh what
you think about this if you have bad
things to say about these guys say in
the comments if you have good things to
say about them they get enough ego
tripping so don't bother um thanks so
much guys it's an honor uh see you next
time
peace peace
what's funny is like i have a bunch of
instagram videos of me puking in that
exact same spot it's going to be like a
thing like come to mike's gym peek in
his fucking backyard
