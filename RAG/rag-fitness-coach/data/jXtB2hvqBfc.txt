hey folks dr mike isratel here
with a really important message you're
slacking off
wait no i said that wrong
how do you tell
if you're slacking off in the gym
especially with hypertrophy training
training for muscle growth and how can
you fix it
what do we mean by going hard enough
in this specific video in this case we
mean
you're not sure
if you are leaving reps in the tank
you're not sure
if you are going close enough to failure
sometimes you get to failure and you say
oh i failed i can't move anymore but
you're not sure if you're lying to
yourself we all have a little bit of
doubt but if you have a lot of doubt if
you've seen some other videos and said
hey you really need to train harder and
you're really second guessing yourself
you might be interested in in shit
testing yourself you might be interested
in saying okay
i want to find a way to really see if
i'm pushing it as far as i can
or to really see that well okay
i was
really slacking and i can do better
because you don't want to go
through months and even longer of
mediocre gains gains you could have been
better and realize after all that that
the only reason you weren't gaining is
you weren't pushing hard enough like
you're serious about this you're really
dedicated that's why you're watching
this video
but it's also
a big mind fuck to always be doubting
yourself and being man i'm not pushing
hard enough and actually realize you
were pushing hard enough the entire time
and maybe you could have backed off a
little bit in various other ways and
gotten even better results it's good to
know where you stand objectively
on pushing hard enough and we do have a
test for it it's not the perfect test
but it's a damn good one and you can try
it yourself soon i'll explain it in a
bit how it works
to see are you really pushing it really
hard or is there more left to push so
here we go
here's the test you do your normal
massive cycle of training you do your
last pre-deload week ask program zero
rir or to failure whatever it is
write down all of your sets and reps and
numbers
normal
this week should be very hard and
hopefully for you it already is
right
it should be
very near failure or at failure and with
super high fatigue
here's the test it's a tough test
instead of taking a deload
you add one more week to your normal
training program so normally you do five
weeks and then a deload this time after
five weeks do week six
and
you go in
and you
try to replicate the performance you did
in the last week so you don't add any
more sets same number of sets as week
five or the last week you did
same number of sets
except you choose
for every single set
you either do the same number of reps
but add like two and a half pounds just
barely add two and a half or five pounds
to the left two and a half if it's like
an isolation lift and if it's compound
like leg press you can add five
or you do the same exact weight but you
do one more rep than last time so last
time you did uh your first set of squats
was a set of 12 this time same weight
set of 13.
only one of those not both
okay either add a rep
or two and a half to five pounds to
every single set
that you did last week this week same
number of sets
we're just going the smallest edge of
further beyond that we can
and what you're trying to do is to see
if you can perform just a little bit
better than last week that's the entire
test
here's what's going to happen
you are going to do one of three things
generally and it's going to be per set
and per exercise and per muscle group so
there could be some differences
you are going to underperform
so last time you got a set of 12 with
400 pounds in the squat this time you
did a set of 10 and you were like that
physically couldn't get up that was it
right
and the big thing is
during this testing week you got to try
really fucking hard you have to put your
ego on the line to say it means a lot
for me to beat this last week's set by
one rep or to get the same number of
reps
and
do
a little bit more weight five more
pounds and i have more pounds invest
a lot
of your psychic energy into making that
happen you're trying to win
and if in this week you underperform you
can't win
that's option a option b is you tie the
performance exactly
you had 400 pounds you did 12 reps with
it you tried to do 13 but you just did
12 again okay
or
option c is you beat last week's numbers
405 for 12 last week this time 405 for
13 or even 14
but
just do one it's good enough just one
above 13 and you're done
if it's really easy do 14 then you have
other problems
or it's 405 last week for 12 this time
it's for 12 but 410 and you successfully
did it that means you beat last week's
numbers it's of course going to be
different various muscles groups and so
on and so forth because you could be
slacking on biceps but really going hard
on shoulders it'll tell you everything
you need to know about every particular
muscle group
and then you analyze
so if
you passed the test what does passing
mean passing means one of two things you
either underperform ironically in that
last week
or you just barely managed to tie
because here's what this means
if in the week before what you said you
were going fucking as hard as you could
basically
you hit 400 for a 405 for a set of 12 in
the squat let's see
and then this week
you hit 405 for a set of 10
we're saying you said you went close to
failure last time
and the accumulated fatigue was really
high if both of those were true the
accumulated fatigue plus the fact that
you're already super close to failure
means it's very unlikely you're going to
hit a pr even manage to tie it you're
going to be weaker because of that
accumulated fatigue if it's true that
you were pushing hard enough
and you show up you do 405
and you hit a set of 8 instead of 12 and
you're like oh fuck that's way too it's
insane and i mean you really tried and
the set of eight was you had spotters
and you came up and number nine didn't
happen that's it you tried as hard as
you could remember if you're not trying
in this week
there's no way to find out if you're
really trying hard so you have to tell
yourself this week i'm trying as hard as
possible and you try to beat your last
week's numbers and if you can't do it
that means yeah you really were going
hard last week and you don't have to
worry about a thing you passed you were
training hard enough
another way of passing
is if you tied the lifts
yeah sure the cumulative fatigue was
really high
and you were very close to failure last
time but this week i mean you really
just dug your brain into it you're like
fuck that i'm gonna fucking get 12 reps
at least with four or five and you do
you just managed to tie it
we'll call on that you train heart you
train hard enough because with all of
your focus you just barely were able to
tie and not exceed well gee you really
were really close to the edge last time
certainly close enough that regularly
getting that close to your muscle cycles
in the last week is hard enough to get
all the best results going much harder
than that is just a lot of extra fatigue
and not a lot of extra anything else
right
however
let me see if this is yeah so this is
just a few past
and
if you passed which means you either
underperformed in this week you weren't
able to match your last week or you got
the same performance just barely
then you don't need to train any harder
in all likelihood you can answer in the
affirmative
that i am training hard enough and i
wouldn't try this test
for another
months or years after
as long as you still feel like you're
connected to training hard and you're
not doubting yourself there's no reason
to ever repeat this test unless you
really get curious again all right i
really think i've been slacking off then
you repeat the test otherwise don't
repeat okay because it's really ultra
super fatiguing you have to take a nice
solid deal after and it actually risks
injury just a little bit more than
normal training so it's not something we
want to do all the time
and the way it doesn't risk injury is if
you were correct in guessing that you
were training easy
if you were in fact training ultra hard
and you passed this test you're risking
injury considerably more because then
you are as fatigued as you say
right
there's no reason to test this again
because you found out hey actually i was
training hard okay great
what happens if you fail this test
what does that look like
if
those lifts that you had when you had a
xyz performance in the last week and
then you did that extra test week and
your performance improved
this means that
how hard this last week was
plus the fatigue it generated still
wasn't enough of a disruption to get you
to underperform you recovered from last
week and ascended even further which
means that last week could not have been
that hard
maybe it was ultra hard
but like you just didn't accumulate
enough volume which means
maybe you are going ultra close to
failure
and you tell yourself look i went to
failure i tried as hard how come i can
get stronger still in another week then
the answer is real simple you're not
doing enough training volume then you're
babying yourself on that side either way
if you can improve after your last week
either it's the relative effort you're
not going hard enough per set or you're
not doing enough sets either way you
have an answer you shouldn't be able to
do a better job next week
right
then you know you're not pushing hard
enough if you can get an improvement
how do you fix that
deload scrap everything relax
let the fatigue go away in your next
meso you have some options
you were telling yourself i'm starting
three reps
in reserve on your first week typically
what you thought was three reps in
reserve it probably was more like four
or five
an option you have if you failed the
test and you actually improved
performance in that last testing week is
the next meso start closer to failure
than you think
say well my three rar was clearly wrong
so i'm going to try to go into two reps
from failure and that'll probably be
what actually is three alright try that
in addition week to week to week you
could more aggressively add load or reps
you have a good session you did 10 last
week at 100 pounds this time you're like
i'll stop at 11. even though you know
you could have stopped at 15 no problem
so you're used to adding just one rep or
just two and a half pounds
but clearly that's been resulting in
your peak week being too easy uh when
you feel really good say okay i'm
actually gonna add five pounds instead
of two and a half or i'll add two reps
instead of one be a little bit more
aggressive in the additions week to week
so you either start harder or start just
the same and aggress harder progress
harder so that the end last week can be
something that is a very serious attempt
as training as hard as possible
now of course option c is duh some
combination of both start a little bit
closer to failure progress a little bit
more aggressively remember the goal is
to start decent and progress until you
burn up until you can't do any more
and if you tested that week and you
could do any more some shit's got to
change you either got to start close to
failure or you got to start uh
progressing a little bit more
aggressively just a little bit more but
something has to be done because you're
not training uh hard enough now that is
assuming remember this whole talk is
assuming your volume is good enough it
could be your training way too low
volume we have 50 other ways to solve
that so the volume should be solved
even within its own right
if the volume is good you may not be
training hard enough if you can match
that performance and beat it
this
solution means that if you try this
again there's no way you're going to
match your performance and beat it
because you're starting closer to
failure you're progressing faster so
whatever you did instead of 405 for 12
and you're like i did it for 13 no
problem this next time it's gonna be
four or five for 15 you're going to be
so fatigued you're going to do it for 10
and you're going to be like okay well
shit i really did do a really good job
last week right
now
this
whole structure this whole test is
predicated on one flimsy little thing
and that is your ability to push in that
one last final week psychologically
that's tough
luckily it's not a test like we'll just
train harder all the time because that
requires you to change your psychology
for every week luckily it's just one
week
so it can be a temporary change in
mindset but you may need some help
getting you to that mindset of going
ultra fucking hard and that's the same
mindset you should have
in that test week that sixth week or
whatever but it should also be the same
one you should have in that last week
and maybe you don't have that mindset
last week and that's why that last week
is too easy and you're actually not
pushing as hard as you could
so how do you fix that
a couple of suggestions just off the top
to get your head right
to either train normally from now on
hard enough or the kind of element of
psychology you should be bringing into
that last week it works for both here it
is first
think about why you are in the gym
do you demand success for your program
because remember most of us are in the
gym yeah it's fun for sure that's great
but most of us are in the gym and we
care and we watch videos like this
because we want results
so if you want results
you gotta fucking wake up and do
something about them
when you're pressing the last rep of
your set in the chest press
how much do you want big pecks because
if you really fucking want them you're
going to go fuck this i have another rep
and it happens or well shit here we go
and maybe another and maybe another but
if you're like ah my pecs are good
enough then you can rack any time you
want and then i have nothing more to say
to you as far as motivation because
clearly you are where you want to be
but it's a good idea before you head to
the gym or when you're at the gym or
before the set or even during the set to
think i want success i demand success
and i'm going to do another rep to see
if i can because if i can then i haven't
been training hard enough if i can't hey
shit i've done everything i could
this whole thing is about doing doing
everything you can nothing more just
what you can
second suggestion if you need a little
bit more focus mentally to get the hard
shit done think about this way
your situation
training hard enough looking a certain
way
will just end up there the rest of your
life we're not gonna fuck with do you
train hard enough or do you look like
what you want to look
there's an interesting realization you
can make
you you are the only person able to
leverage anything to change that
nobody's coming to save you there's not
going to be some kind of way for you to
get more jacked without doing more work
there's not going to be some kind of way
for you to alter your program or to
actually train hard enough it's all on
you
you are the only force in the equation
that can do something so when you get
into that chest process and you think oh
i'm going to go all the way you are the
only person that can do that it has to
be something you realize to take into
your hands no i'm going to make this
next rep happen and i'm going to make
this not sure what happened i'm the only
one that can do it there's no looking
out to the side you guys guys get close
to failure to look this way that way
there's nobody to look at it's all on
you and if you can really meditate on
that you can be like well fuck man
if i'm the only person that determines
if i grow or not grow in a program i'm
at least gonna fucking bring my best and
then you're on the right track
next
this is real mind fuck
you can take pride
in your ability of letting your ego go
and
reduce your aversion to pain or failure
a lot of the reason why people don't
want to push that last rep is because it
actually hurts and if you think you're
tough
then you might be tough enough to say i
don't care if it hurts my ego is
attached to the idea of not pain
i'm going to relax my ego and say if
pain happens it's okay with me because
you're not going to get hurt it's just
another rep it's all exercises real safe
in the gym the worst thing that can
really happen is two things
you can just experience the pain of
muscles going close to failure that
sucks but you can free your ego at least
for a short time of having to worry
about i don't care about the pain
meditate on that when i come in this set
is about to start you get into the leg
press you're ready to go
you think fuck there's a lot of pain
coming you can come to a realization and
you don't i don't give a fuck i don't
care it's gonna be pain and i'm
expecting it so when it's pain it's okay
and i know it hurts and it's okay and
i'm gonna do another rep and i'm gonna
do another rep because pain doesn't
scare me because i've expected it if you
can make that line of reasoning in your
head it can really help
another thing i said two things
is the fear of failure
there's a bit of a psychological mind
fuck to where you're coming up out of
the hole with a squad or with a leg
press or bench
and you just don't get the rep so it's
like easy to get into the gym in such a
way and you always go zero r close to
fail but you never quite fail because
you don't wanna you don't wanna
experience that failure of literally not
getting another rep well it's not a big
deal there's a huge way in which nobody
gives a shit
and there's a huge way in which you need
to go to failure every now and again
just to test to make sure you're
training hard enough you give a shit
so your ego is attached to not failing
at things it hurts the ego if you fail a
lift your ego doesn't like this it likes
all this and i did it yay rack good
enough
remove your ego and all the pain that
comes in during those chest presses it's
your pain you own it we welcome that
pain
and the failure you don't care if you
fail
you want to push as hard as fucking
possible and a failure results that
doesn't somehow say you're a bad person
or that you weren't trying hard enough
or that you didn't accomplish something
bodybuilding is real fucked like that
failure is what we're looking for
failure is success that's weird right
abandon everything you know and just go
good technique of course and then when
failure happens oh it's just molecular
like there's just not enough force being
generated who gives a shit
you succeed in this case if you actually
drive yourself to failure and so few
people can
thinking about it this way is taking
your ego and going i don't give a fuck
if it hurts and don't give a fuck if i
fail i'm just gonna go
if you can bring that kind of intensity
to that testing week you have a good
chance of beating your numbers and
showing to yourself that you're actually
a fucking pussy you haven't been
training hard enough
if you still with all those weapons
don't beat that last week well shit you
really are training hard and there's no
more you can give at the end of the day
that's what we're testing is do you have
any more to give and if the answer is no
hey sweet no big deal right
last little trick to make sure that last
sixth testing week or whatever i keep
saying six that depends on how long your
meso is but n plus one week the after
your last week your test week to see if
you can push it further
remember this because you can go in
there with all these things and be like
fuck yeah but some of them are really
scary like man i don't want to like just
be open to whatever pain comes fuck that
that's some buddhist monk shit that's a
couple years down in training for me
here's a slightly easier way to think
about this
all you ever need
is to beat those numbers by two and a
half pounds or one added rep
the test week doesn't say you have to go
to all-out failure
the test week it easily accomplishes
telling you you've been training too
easy if you can do any more so when you
come to that sixth week and you see it
says 10 reps or 200 pounds all you have
to do is 11. that's not that hard
just get 11. if you can't
turns out you're right you do train hard
enough and if you can
then you're bullshit testing yourself
well enough to realize wow
i wasn't training hard enough and i know
that's an ego hit and you have to admit
to yourself like holy fuck i was being a
pussy here's some good news
one you get great games training not so
hard turns out you don't need to go all
out to get great gains so no big deal
you probably didn't miss much of
anything
here's another piece of good news the
fact that you found this out now means
all of your training from now until
infinity when you continue to train hard
is gonna be more productive you want to
find this out early it's like finding
out you suck at like fighting in like
elementary school and your parents put
you in jiu jitsu and then you're a
fucking stone cold killer the rest of
your life versus like having illusions
about being a good fighter from just
watching too many kung fu movies and at
age like 34 somebody knocks you the fuck
out outside of a club and people are
like wow you're a pussy i had no idea
and you're like shit i didn't know
either it's better to find out early and
it's better to find out using yourself
rather than somebody else right you have
the control of the situation so if you
really think you're being because a lot
of times a bunch of the comments and
everywhere else people are like man i
don't really know if i'm going hard
enough now you have an objective test
with which to do so and the only
subjective part of that test because the
outcomes are objective the only
subjective part is can you willpower
yourself for just one fucking week to
push all out and not even all out i mean
make it easier for you push just hard
enough to get a little better than last
week if you can
easy you can make your training harder
and then everything will be better and
if you can't and you actually push but
you still can't perform any better shit
you've been doing things right the whole
time no big deal if any of this is
confusing or if you need any more sort
of motivation or insight or anything
like that drop a couple questions in the
comments below i'll try to answer them
let's get after the shit and if we're
actually getting after it we can focus
on other things like technique
consistency
food your sleep and everything else
because if you're training hard enough
everything else is an easy solution if
you're not training hard enough that's
the thing that has to be solved nice and
early so you can get to everything else
get huge get friends get wealth you're
flying into
jet russian models everywhere
you know success
see you there
you
