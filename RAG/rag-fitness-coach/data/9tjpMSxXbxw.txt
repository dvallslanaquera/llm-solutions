hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today's topic is to ask the question
for yourself are you training too heavy
for hypertrophy training let us examine
what that means exactly we have four
things to talk about specifically
weights that are absolutely too heavy
for hypertrophy training well don't
worry we'll define what that means
sfr too heavy your stimulus to fatigue
ratio is off because the weights are too
heavy
we're talking about personal honesty and
what's too heavy and what's not and then
loading diversity and exercise matching
to really find that we're doing a good
range of loads and not whistling out
away from one or the other and to make
sure we're using the right exercises
to do the heavy training versus the
light training because there is an
exercise specificity
to loading so training
too heavy in the absolute sense is very
easy to define
plenty of researchers confirmed this
anything less than about five reps per
set
has a very dubious effect on hypertrophy
and
has incredible effects on fatigue
specifically joint and connective tissue
fatigue
so what does that mean that means if
you're trying to get big by doing sets
of three you're absolutely supplying
enough tension
enough tension per rep and per set but
because it's only three reps
the total volume of tension right it's
like drinking orange juice that's really
delicious but you're drinking it one
half of a shot glass at a time
if hypertrophy is supplying enough
orange juice to really get you
just oh this is enough orange juice all
the orange juice that i want
you're gonna have to pour a big ass
glass and if you're pouring and drinking
by half of
a bar shot at a time it's gonna be an
incredibly laborious process
so if you're interested in growing
muscle optimally from sets of three
you're going to have to do more sets of
three than you would sets of 10 by a
long shot
and each set of 10 is very hypertrophic
because it's got lots of reps in it
each set of three only a little bit
right only there's a set equivalency to
hypertrophy
where hard sets are roughly equivalent
for hypertrophy
hard sets of five are roughly cause the
same growth as hard sets of eight
and ten and even thirty but anything
under five that conversion no longer
really works
so hard sets of four cause almost as
much hypertrophy
set for set as hard sets of let's say
ten hard sets of three
gee maybe half that hard sets of one
maybe like a
third right or a fourth of the
hypertrophy per set of a set of ten
so imagine this let's say you're just
doing singles to take the absurd but
relevant example
four sets of 10 let's say it's a good
hypertrophy stimulus for you if we just
said that each single is a quarter of
the hypertrophy drive of a set of 10
that is means we need to do 16 singles
heavy singles in order to get the same
as four by ten folks what's harder to do
four by ten or sixteen singles at like
ninety or ninety-five percent of your
arm that's insane
nobody does that because the fatigue is
like and the stimulus is if the fatigue
if the stimulus is going to be the same
as 4x10 the fatigue is going to be
multiples higher
terrible terrible idea so absolutely too
heavy is definitely a thing
now the next point so just to finish off
that one real quick
does that mean you can't do sets of four
five per trophy no if you really feel
the tension in a target muscle you're
getting great results
go for it we just don't advise it as a
matter of course so if you're coming to
heaven if you're training anew
if you've been training a while and
you're thinking oh should i do sets of
three the answer is probably not
all right keep your sets over five reps
it's a good idea and under thirty great
idea
now what about two heavy sfr this isn't
this too heavy via sfr
also applies to every single rep range
under five it applies to four a lot
three even more two even more and one
the most
but it also can't apply to the normal
range of five to ten
here's the deal sets of five to ten are
supposed to be hypertrophic just as
hypertrophy as anything but sometimes
your sfr stimulus to fatigue ratio can
be so bad
for certain exercises or certain
movements that
you might actually not be able to
generate that hypertrophic set to set
equivalency and here's how you can tell
that might be the case
too heavy for you relatively here's the
deal
when you're doing let's say an exercise
that is in the five to 10 rep range
and you're suspecting that the stimulus
fatigue ratio is just not high enough to
be worth it one of the ways you can tell
is
you can't tell if the target muscle is
generating a high degree of tension
or you know for a fact that non-target
muscles are taken over
like you're doing squats for sets of six
and someone's like you feel your quads
right you're like
not really and then the other one is
you're doing squats for sets of six and
someone's like quads and you're like
actually i can for sure tell you that my
glutes and lower back are really kicking
in towards
close to failure and my quads never
really kick in that's not exactly what
you want
out of target muscle training which is
hypertrophy training
next you experience a lot of joint pain
and discomfort you're doing lateral
raises for sets of five
and someone's like what do you think
shoulders and you're like dude my
shoulders are gonna fall off every
single rep hurts more and more in the
shoulder joint i mean that's not a good
idea to keep doing
there's no law that says you have to do
lateral raises because it's a five maybe
it's a good idea to reconsider
that because the stimulus might be
decent probably not but the fatigue is
really high so the sfr is down so maybe
it's not a good idea to do
next you have external technique
breakdown which is very common
you actually can't do the lift justice
okay sets a five and a lateral raise is
supposed to look like this but every
time you get close to sets of five
and if you can't hold it at the top you
just can't do the lift properly
right instead of pull downs being an
arch retractor and release pinch your
lats at the bottom
sets of eight and the pull down might be
like you're pulling down and then you're
like
you got to get your chin over the bar
and you're like smash it down
and all of a sudden you actually can't
execute really really good technique
your skull crushers turn into close grip
benches even though you're trying hard
to do good technique
it comes as a trade-off either you're
doing good technique and you can't get
close to failure
which is bad or you're doing really bad
technique in getting close to failures
you can't actually just the external
technique breaks down
because the weight is too heavy that
doesn't happen to all exercises
exercises like squats and benches and
rows big compound movements
your technique looks identical you know
at all the heavy ranges
because the heavy technique that you're
using the heavier the weight is the
better your technique gets
the more reps you lift like if you
collapse in the squat you usually do
less reps but for some exercises
specifically machine movements and
isolation movements
when you go heavy enough you're not
actually doing that exercise anymore
you're just doing a point a to point b
lift of getting the work done
no bueno because the target muscle isn't
receiving the effort and so on and so
forth
another way to tell is there's minimal
or no disruption in the target muscle
after training
right you do a whole lot of upright rows
for sets of six and someone's like dude
you got a delt pump like are your delts
like tired or sore and you're like i
can't no
no i never got a pump i did five sets
never got a pump never got any
disruption my doubts don't even feel
weak they feel fine except my shoulders
hurt
right so if you're not getting like a
hit then maybe it's not a good idea this
is one of the ways to tell
but sometimes you do hack squats you're
like man this exercise is great and you
are like i love hack spots for sets of
10 to 20. let me try them for sets of
eight you do them for sets of eight
and four sets later usually you wouldn't
be able to walk because your quads are
so messed up you know for sets of eight
and someone's like higher quads you're
like
they're fine right you don't have to say
that about a muscle after you've trained
it really hard
you want to have a notable disruption
because that's probably correlated that
you actually did work for the target
muscle
it's not a lot of disruption maybe it's
not the best idea for you to be doing
right
and then lastly maybe your stimulus
isn't that great but you have to try so
hard
there's so much systemic fatigue your
rpe is so high right
in order to get psyched up to doing
let's say
squats for sets of six front squats or
something
you need to just just get really nasty
and that just tires you out like crazy
or deadlifts or sets of five
just tires you out like crazy to have to
try that hard to lift those crazy heavy
weights
if you lift more moderate weights every
set is just as hypertrophic but you
don't have to go nuts inside your head
you don't have to go
crazy on the rating of perceived
exertion and all of a sudden you can do
more sets
less systemic fatigue less psychological
fatigue it's more sustainable
movement for the same or greater
hypertrophy so if any of these things
are going on
to a really big extent you might have an
exercise that is a candidate for no
longer training as heavy
now this takes a lot of personal honesty
to do
the personal honesty goes in two
directions direction number one is this
you're not in the gym to hit prs
you're in the gym to cause growth and
prs are just a result of that growth and
a tool to track it and make sure it's
happening
and a tool to cause it but the pr's
themselves
are not growth they're just a sign of
growth they're a sign that you're on the
right track
they're not everything so if you're
hitting pr's and lifting super heavy
but you're not hitting your target
muscle you're just hurting your joints
all of that is
really not a good use of your time
someone could be like oh man
your bent row shot up this last year
like i love man bent rose crazy like has
your back grown a lot you're like
not really but my glutes are bigger
because i use my glutes a lot to bent
row now
it's a stupid idea maybe too heavy for
training right
but on the other hand it takes a lot of
honesty not to bitch out either
it sounds like a confrontational thing
to say here's the thing
heavy squats are supposed to feel heavy
right there's some mind muscle
connection you won't get yeah you should
feel
super high tension in your quads but
it's not going to feel like the same
burn or anything like that some people
get a big pump and a big burn they are
getting high tension they're like it's
too heavy
like why are you getting high tension in
your packs or in your quads like yeah
or are you making progress yeah like
does a muscle feel disrupted after yeah
but like i could use a better pump like
that's not all pump training
so a lot of times people say oh it's too
heavy but even though they're checking
all the sfr boxes that they're supposed
to be for heavy training because tension
on the muscle is the big one there don't
worry about the pump too much definitely
don't worry about the burn too much
so sometimes people stray away from
heavy lifting because they're like
it's too heavy i can't feel it and you
ask them some questions it turns out
they can feel it they just don't want to
lift that heavy so don't miss out on big
weights
there's a good range of big weights to
be using when you can still feel tension
on target muscle and your joints aren't
hurting then it's all grady keep doing
it but if your joints are hurting and
you're no longer feeling tension and
target muscle
honestly then it is actually too heavy
now what about loading diversity and
exercise matching here's the thing
we're talking about oh this is too heavy
some exercises
are supposed to be trained heavier and
you're unlikely to run into these
problems with them
deadlifts presses squats barbaros
pull-ups usually they're really great to
train the 5-10
5-15 rep range so if you train them like
that you're unlikely to run to these
problems however
there are other exercises which are
really likely to run these problems we
would say
don't really do them in the low rep
ranges for example
machines dumbbell movements things like
lunges that require a lot of stability
cables they're not usually going to feel
like they're doing a whole lot of
anything
and they're going to be causing a lot of
fatigue in the 5
to 15 rep range and they're better off
in the 15 to 30 rep range not always
but on average so if you do cable
upright rows for sets of eight and
you're surprised that it only hurts your
shoulders and doesn't feel anything in
your delts
you know you might have had that coming
but if you're doing squats for sets of
eight
and you're like oh i sure hope this
isn't too heavy it's probably not it's
probably going to feel great
so what you want to do is use a
diversity of exercises
use the more compound barbell movements
for the lower up ranges and the machines
and dumbbells and so on and cables for
the higher rep ranges and all of a
sudden you've solved a lot of these
problems before they've ever actually
occurred now
there's a benefit to using the entire
loading range so that's a 5 to 30 reps
you just use different exercises for
each range and
when an exercise feels too heavy be
honest about it
right and either reduce the weight so
you can get good mind muscle connection
so on and so forth maybe just bump the
wraps a little bit
or keep the reps the same but your mind
muscle connection is better no big deal
or switch to an exercise that tolerates
higher load better so if you're doing
lateral raises
and not feeling a whole lot switch to
upright rows and all of a sudden those
same sets of eight are really really
awesome and everything's going super
well
now that being said so we're saying
everyone should train
more or less some of their for every
muscle group some of their lifting
should be
all the way between five and thirty reps
that doesn't mean sets of five but you
know five to ten
ten to twenty and twenty three should
have some lifting in all those three
main rep ranges
sometimes on rare occasions it doesn't
work out
some of your muscles may really just not
respond to very heavy that is that's a
five to ten
training almost at all an example for
many people
that have this occur is like side delts
there may be no exercise that gets your
side delts going in any notable way
and sets a five to ten right it's just
not enough time generating tension not
enough metabolites
not enough mechanical work and the way
that side delts are trained with upright
rows and various
laterals it might just be super just not
conducive
to heavy loading and you try it and try
to try it it just always messes up your
elbows and your shoulders and it's tons
of rpe
and your technique externally breaks
down it's just all nonsense
you might not have to do it you can just
do your side delts
in the 10
to 20 and 20 to 30 rep range and grow
like a weed no problem
just never fully close the door on that
keep an open mind
and maybe later you'll come back to side
delts when you're bigger and stronger
and have a better minor muscle
connection
all of a sudden the sets of 8 or 10 on
the upright row is an excellent exercise
so don't say never i'll never do
hamstrings for sets of 5 to 10 because
only sets of 10 plus work for me
say you know for now for a while for a
few mesocycles i'm going to leave that
alone
maybe you can thread it back later and
see great results so justin bieber was
wrong
never say never is internally
contradictory advice
and i really hope that's all you've
learned today folks thank you so much
see you next time for the next video of
what training to light is like and how
to attack that problem
