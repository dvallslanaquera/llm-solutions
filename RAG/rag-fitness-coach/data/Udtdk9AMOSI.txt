hey folks dr mike here as usual for
renaissance periodization
when to take breaks this is building
your first
program video number four please watch
the other three videos for any of this
to make a ton of sense but
so far we have gotten to a point where
we're training really hard
successively progressively we're getting
much bigger much stronger great results
weeks and weeks later
and we start to get as the french would
say a retired
that is french by the way as many of you
know i have
multiple degrees in french cuisine i
lived in france for a very long time
shit i loved the lie i was born in
france
i'm french but in any case french things
aside
how do we know it's time to take a break
how do we know our fatigue is too much
in fact what the hell is fatigue anyway
let's get into it so first is the
concept of accumulating fatigue
every single hard training session
that robustly grows muscle and improves
strength also causes fatigue in much the
same way
every delicious meal made in a kitchen
causes a bit of a mess
at least the frying pan is dirty you
threw some you know
eggshells into the garbage maybe a few
bread crumbs got on the floor
if you were just to infinitely cook in a
kitchen and make tasty meals at some
point
the mess the fatigue would get really
high and start to interfere with your
process of cooking
you can't make great eggs if the frying
pan is dirty because then the eggs just
taste like diner eggs which is to say
whatever the hell was on the grill last
time and the time before that
so with hard enough training
and not doing anything about the fatigue
right there and then so it's a fact that
hard training comes with fatigue
it's also a fact that yeah a lot of the
fatigue comes down between session and
session so if you train monday wednesday
friday
you'll the fatigue at the end of the
workout on monday is really high and
then it falls
and then you during wednesday and then
it falls and you train friday but it
falls
but it doesn't go back all the way to
baseline
because training hard enough and
frequently enough for your best possible
gains
means that on average fatigue is going
to rise slowly
over and over the course of weeks and
weeks of this progression
and then at some point it's going to get
to accumulate to a level that is too
high to have the best possible
productive training we'll have to do
something about it just like when a
kitchen gets so dirty you're like ah
we just need to clean this kitchen
because i can't do my job anymore
same thing with fatigue except in this
case
cumulative fatigue when it gets high
enough has a couple of notable
sort of dependable bad things it causes
first
is it can disrupt technique the more
fatigued you are the sloppier your
technique is we know that's bad news
already and it happens especially in
beginners
secondly if you're in a high fatigue
state
any one really good muscle and strength
building workout builds less muscle and
strength than usual than if you are in a
lower fatigue state
just like delicious meals in a shitty
kitchen
aren't as delicious anymore because
you're like is there asparagus in these
eggs you're like
no but we grilled asparagus on the same
grill right before i went and wash it
right same idea and it creates
an enhancement in injury risk injury
risk is always really low with weight
training
but as you get more and more fatigued
the injury risk starts to rise
to some degree and you don't want that
to get too out of hand
in fact this three-point process usually
happens in that order
once your fatigue gets pretty high your
technique starts to get
usually pretty fuzzy as the fatigue
rises even further
then each session becomes quite a bit
less productive
when fatigue is really high your injury
risk starts to really rise up
now do you ever want to get your fatigue
so high that your injury risk
really is notably elevated no because by
then your technique sucks
and which independently causes injury
risk and
you're just not building uh as much
muscle or building as much strength as
you could be
so the ideal thing with fatigue is to
catch it nice and early
when it just starts to cusp up into the
too much zone
just like a restaurant kitchen or a
personal cooking kitchen
like when the mess starts to get like to
be a bit much then it's time to clean
you don't wait
until you're slipping on banana peels in
the middle of the kitchen you probably
hit it up a little bit earlier
so if the meals you're cooking are the
highest quality same thing with fatigue
and training
you want to make sure you catch it not
super early but right when it starts to
really interfere with the process
cut it off do something to bring it down
we'll talk about one in a second
and then move on and continue to make
great progress after that
so if fatigue gets high enough to start
degrading technique
especially in beginners a few not ideal
things tend to happen first your
injuries goes up automatically because
of poor technique by itself
that's best avoided if possible for
obvious reasons you're in another gym to
get hurt
number two the effectiveness of your
workouts reduces because remember good
technique
activates the muscles we want doesn't
fatigue the muscles we don't
and all of a sudden you know if you're
putting in a ton of effort but you're
really fatigued
the amount of stuff you're getting out
of the um the workout is not that great
especially if your fatigue is if your
technique is off but if you have great
technique you really stimulate the
muscle you want you get great results
once your technique starts to break down
that's not ideal
and maybe worst of all in the long term
if you practice with bad technique
because of fatigue you learn bad
technique remember you
for the human brain practicing and
learning is really the same thing
there's not a way in which the human
brain especially for a beginner task
can differentiate between trying
something and then leaving it alone
versus trying something and the brain
being like this is the right thing so if
you have crappy crappy crappy technique
for
weeks on end then your body's like this
is how we do this exercise and it learns
to do it bad
which is terrible because then
unlearning is actually a really hard
process
not something we want to get into so
ideally
we want to start the fatigue reduction
process in beginners especially
when their technique starts to get shaky
via fatigue
right now so for that
repeated bouts of poor technique are a
really good sign
that it's time to do something about
fatigue now
why do we say repeated two sessions in a
row is probably best because everyone
has a session here
and there where their technique just
sucks you know shit happens
but if it's two sessions or more in a
row it's probably because your fatigue
is excessive and not just because it's a
one-off bad session
so that's a good sign that repeated
technique
failure or repeated technique
degradation is a good sign but sometimes
you could be learning technique really
quickly
unless your technique just gets better
all the time even though you're carrying
a lot of fatigue
and for a variety of other reasons we
might want some more confirmation to
make extra sure that we're not
reducing fatigue sort of in a frightened
manner way too early
so we have at least four things we can
do for signs
that maybe our fatigue is starting to
get a little bit high and it's time to
break it down so first sign
is your workouts feel very very tough at
the end of each session you're exhausted
if that's the case and your technique is
starting to break down you can be sure
your fatigue is probably pretty high
second one is you're getting a bit
intimidated by your workouts
and your desire to train is down notably
from usual you're usually really pumped
to go to the gym and you're like man i
got this i'm going to crush this
and after a few weeks maybe uh probably
a few months sort of two to four months
into the process
you're looking at this next workout
you're like oh god how the hell am i
going to get through that
and also like ugh training i just want
to go relax and this is a bit much
that psychologically actually correlates
very well to a high level of systemic
fatigue
third point is you're hitting prs on
your lifts
but they're getting much harder to hit
you used to add 10 pounds every week
and sometimes 10 pounds on a rep
nowadays months later you're adding like
five or two and a half pounds
and you're grinding out just to set a
small personal record
again beginners usually don't plateau on
strength because they just keep going
but when stuff starts to get really hard
and all these other things are true you
can be
more and more sure that fatigue is high
enough for us to
have a beneficial approach to actually
dealing with it
and of course last but not least your
technique is starting to get a bit iffy
and your lifting is a bit less
coordinated and smooth than usual
you usually squat up and down like a
machine you're like i got this i know
where all my positions are
a few weeks later you feel real
comfortable a few weeks after that or a
few months after that
you're squatting you're like oh my hips
even back like is my chest up is it down
who knows
i feel kind of weird and maybe you look
at the video of your lift like ah that
looks like shit and felt like shit
maybe it's time to break things down
maybe fatigue is a bit too high
so when fatigue is excessively high what
we do
for beginners is we execute a special
kind of training week called a deload
week
the only purpose of a deal a week is
twofold one to conserve the muscle and
strength that you do have to make sure
it doesn't go away because if we stop
training something goes away
and two to greatly take fatigue and
reduce it all the way back pretty much
to baseline
so that we can clear room for another
productive progressive process of
strength and muscle gain
super simple right in many beginners
this need for a deal in week will first
occur about
two to four months after the beginning
of their consistent hard training
and if this hasn't happened to you yet
if you're five months in and you're just
not meeting any of the signs on the last
slide and everything's golden
that's okay don't worry about it keep
plugging along eventually everyone needs
to deload
you don't have to go too soon definitely
don't go too late but if it just hasn't
happened to you no big deal
when it does happen when the fatigue
does check most of those boxes
then you can do a sort of three-step
deload process the first thing you do is
when you detect the fatigue is excessive
in that week of training that you're
doing finish that week strong
grind if you have to so if like on a
wednesday of a monday wednesday friday
split
you notice you're like dude i am in the
hole i need a deload
finish friday finish that wednesday
workout nut up
ovary up finish friday it might suck
do your best finish that week then the
next week
you take the first half of that week
monday tuesday wednesday we'll call that
first half
thursday friday saturday sunday second
half i know it's not evenly symmetrical
no big deal first half of the week you
do the same weights as you did in your
last week
all right your last heart training week
same weights on the bar do the same warm
everything except cut all of your sets
in half
and for each set you do actually do
compare the reps you got last week and
do half of them
so if you did uh 10 reps at 135 pounds
last week
for let's say on average of four sets of
roughly 10 reps
this time you do only two sets not four
and you still do 135 pounds
but you do sets of five and not ten
right
and if you've got sets of eight you'll
do sets of four and you say but that's
not sets of five to ten that's true but
they're not designed to be stimulative
they're designed to deload you and to
reduce fatigue real simple formula
that's for the first half of the week so
in a monday wednesday friday split that
would be the monday and wednesday
workout you would do just like that
half the sets half the reps same weight
easy for the second half of the week
which in the monday wednesday friday
would only be friday workout
you just don't show up to the gym take
time off relax
eat sleep rest and then your fatigue
will fall like crazy
and then the next week you'll be able to
come back and hit it hard again
right some of you either looking at this
intellectually for the first time
or having experienced it yourself will
be like dude this is so easy
that's the point it's supposed to be
easy
imagine you have a super super tough
monday through friday job where you need
to be on point intellectually make fast
decisions so on and so forth it's a
great job you love it
you're really good at it but it's tough
should your weekends
be full of hardship or should they be
super easy to bring down fatigue
i mean can you imagine someone's like
hey man let's go to three parties and go
skiing this weekend and you're like i
have another hard week of work next week
fuck that i'm gonna go and i'm gonna
turn on netflix
i'm gonna light up like eight joints in
a row smoke them shits harmonica style
eat all the food in the world
sleep for 19 hours and then when i come
back to work on monday i'm gonna be like
fucking superman
because the whole point of the weekend
is to relax
same with a deal a week it's like a
weekend drawn out so yeah you do a
little bit of training
but it's much easier and then the rest
of the time you take off you're supposed
to come back super fresh which means
towards the end of the deal of the week
you might feel like a bit of a psycho
you're like oh god
i need lifting weights or i'm gonna
commit a crime good i mean
don't commit a crime wait until the week
after
when you can commit a crime against
these weights
it's supposed to be easy it's part of
the process
here are a few things for you to look at
in your own spare time so you can feel
free to pause during the various parts
of this presentation where these are up
on the screen
we have a sample week eight okay this
was the week in which stuff got really
really hard
it sort of last week of accumulation of
progression
and then sometime during this week where
that's a deal of next week
and then this next slide is what that
deload week would look like
week nine that's the deload week notice
monday and wednesday everything's filled
out it's
predictably half the sets half the reps
right and
friday is no training because that's
exactly what we said is a good idea to
do
so quick summary train hard over the
weeks
when you clearly start to get run down
and you can't get the best quality
training anymore take a deal a week
and by the way if you watch just want to
take a week off of the gym that's
totally fine too especially for
beginners you're not really missing out
on anything
just don't lose the gym's address and
come back next time okay
so if you just want to go off on
vacation that's totally fine too but if
you do want to stay dedicated to the
plan
and you want to do your best best best a
deal a week is a little bit better than
a week off
if you're wondering okay i feel like i
sort of need to deload but i'm not sure
you should take a d-load err on the more
frequent side of deloading it keeps
fatigue lower keeps your results better
then there's more than a few reasons and
a few good studies
in the sports science literature to show
us that if we deload a little bit more
frequently we essentially lose nothing
because when you deload you re-sensitize
your body to growth and to strength
enhancement so much
that it just makes better gains when you
come back so even if you deal
like once every five weeks your
long-term results are stellar
if you're like nah fuck that i'm
hardcore and you only deal it every
eight weeks
your results will be almost identical
except you're taking fewer breaks that
way
so you essentially put in a week here
and there every
other month you put an extra week of
work and you get nothing out of it
so airing on the site of more dealering
unless you're delivering every other
week or some shit like that
is better than airing on the side of
less there's no bonus points given to mr
tough guy
right you don't have to hold yourself to
some crazy robot standard
if you feel like you need a de-load
you're pretty convinced just fucking
take one
it's not going to cost you any long-term
gains any longer they can't make that
any more clear
next time for our last video in the
series
we're going to come back and figure out
how to restart your next what's called
mesocycle of training because you
finished this whole cycle right you went
you started week one you went all the
way up through in this example
eight weeks of hard training got too
fatigued time to deload week nine was
deload and
then what do you do we'll talk about
what and then is
in the next video
you
