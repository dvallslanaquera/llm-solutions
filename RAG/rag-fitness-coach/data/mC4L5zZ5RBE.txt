we are smashing
bake
and then
we're smashing
forearms that sounds weird to say hello
we just hate ourselves
and then we come back for the pm which
will all be in this video and we do
shoulders and biceps and
a little bit of self-love
namaste so let's get into it first
exercise is
smith machine bent over rose
let's get in
[Music]
back to my roots
you got a
the light
yeah your spider web
jared stay calm there's a spider here
yesterday oh shit smith machine bent
over rows sets of
5 to 15 reps starting at 15 trending
into like the eights or something like
that
um
these are at a deficit for me they're
going to be a different deficit for
charlie we have a whole ghetto rig here
where we pull out little wooden pads
and we get as much deficit we need
always full range of motion big stretch
at the bottom controlled eccentric
gentle pause
no swinging no bs let's get the work
done we have probably three or so sets
at a heavier weight probably two sets or
so for me at least we'll see what the
guys ought to regulate at a lighter
weight and then we move on to pull downs
after barbell rows build big backs let's
get it done
[Music]
beautiful let's go
[Music]
oh my
last one
[Music]
[Applause]
damn
first time i've ever seen you go 100
tank good job man
soundtrack
there you go
[Music]
our reps together are 7 11.
hey folks welcome back episode two we're
training back today and forearms and
shoulders and biceps and in the meantime
we're gonna be chatting about our first
prep experiences
boy oh boy ups and downs lessons learned
what the results were what we took away
from it further uh
insights for improvement i have all
sorts of
really not fun stories i think we all
had a bit of a different experience for
our first prep charlie benefited greatly
from all of our mistakes and his first
prep was only a year ago jared's first
prep was in 1875 abraham lincoln was uh
just recently lost to us and it was a
sad prep
you know honest abe
and my first prep was an unmitigated
disaster in every possible way
so let's get going jared you're fresh
off the blocks here what uh do you
remember if anything about your first
prep in 1993 um let's see i was 19.
uh it's traffic from men's physique show
in the n a n b f
i ended up getting first
but the prep itself was like
i don't know i was just basically a
jack lean just out of high school kid
and i didn't even know how to track
macronutrients
i just went to the school cafeteria
and i would
uh ask them for
dry tuna because all they have is tuna
salad also can you just give me tuna
from the back if you have it they would
do they were really nice they would do
anything but like
okay can i get this or this okay here
you go i know you're the bodybuilder kid
so
um
then they had always had rice and they
always had broccoli and i just knew
that's what bodybuilders ate and i just
as i got closer to the show i'd eat less
and less of it i'd just keep the protein
high had no idea how to track macros
whatsoever and i just got leaner and
leaner and i was like all right this is
fun
so i mean like you know it could have
been done better i could have probably
been leaner obviously
um
so
my advice to you learn how to track
macros because it's dumb to try to do
this and not know what a macro is
i don't think anyone's that dumb anymore
this is a different era oh
okay just kidding tons of people i coach
lots of bodybuilders but
a lot of our audience is smarter than
that
[Music]
yeah but cast
fuck yeah
[Music]
good shit
you are fucking on track
your conditioning is on track
oh i'm a grunt
five sets of bent rows in the books
three
heavier sets two lighter sets
now
three sets of pull downs
we use a straight bar that doesn't
rotate
once i put my versa grips on
it means it doesn't go anywhere my grip
is not a limiting factor
if you have an access to a straight bar
like that that doesn't rotate
amazing give it a shot three sets
somewhere around a 10 to 20 rep range
mostly around 15.
and
that's the back workout that we move on
to forms
[Music]
like i said i think you you took
slow into consideration for the
concentric phase two
which uh you can be explosive
you're supposed to be
but then just keep celebrating
controlling more just like the
hamstrings yeah okay
oh yeah
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
so i did my first competition i believe
the year was 2013.
i did my competition my first my first
competition it was an mpc show the
metropolitans in new york nick shaw and
i did it together the co-founder of rp
and uh i did the competition one week
after defending my dissertation wow for
my phd
uh what did you say that one time
things you're best done in low stress
things are restaurants environments so
that was that was my mentality was like
i am an ascended god i can do this and
it was a great challenge
i succeeded in my phd and i failed
radically at the show
so what happened let's see
it was a show that i did special sports
supplements for the first time
that i was taking them i did no thyroid
control so i was completely hypothyroid
um i was eating a thousand calories per
day of only protein towards the end and
i spent the vast majority of my time
either being at work or under blankets
watching tv
at home because i was cold no matter
what the temperature was and i couldn't
move because my knee was completely
negative at that point
i was carrying probably 20 if not 25
pounds of body water from zero attempt
at control of body water which with
special sports supplements i'm
particularly prone to
one of my problems was i didn't trust
anybody and it was i had a decent reason
for not trusting anybody i didn't know
that many people in the sport and around
the sport and everyone i attempted to
talk to in order to potentially learn
from turned out to be a fucking idiot
and i put the pictures up online and
um i wasn't proud of myself it was like
oh i did my best i was like that i
sucked
i came a long way since then but it was
just a total disaster and my big mistake
was not hiring a coach
and not being able to trust anybody and
thinking i could do it all and i just
didn't have that
sort of empirical lived knowledge i had
only theory and not such great theory at
that
[Music]
hampshire come on
there it is
get on there too
yeah it's hard to hit the glute's
hamstring at the same time and then hit
the back
perfectly
charlie you let me know when the razing
gets to be too much oh i don't care okay
sweet you're a stupid asshole
how's that harassing
the razzing just turns into just mean
shit like fuck you no i'm not joking
fuck you die
are you still wrestling of course buddy
all right
we are in the pm now same outfit
different session
and uh we are starting with
sort of easy curls it's actually a
really cool modified bar
really really easy on the elbows
especially if supinating tends to hurt
your elbows once you get muscular enough
supination uh becomes really hard so we
are doing
three sets of these curls roughly
something like 10 to 15 reps will see
would auto regulate close to failure but
we're also going to do maya reps so the
first set we're going to let's say do
something like 13 reps the next set we
do however many many sets it takes one
rep away from failure each time to get
to 13 and the last set also 13 more maya
reps the entire time kind of a cool
strategy for isolation once you get a
ton of work in approach failure a lot
and it works a ton because isolation
seem to be not so stimulative except for
set for sets like compounds give it a
shot we'll do this bicep stuff and then
we'll move on to shoulders and then
finally forms see you in a bit
[Music]
oh yeah let's go
[Music]
yep
watch one
that was my first show charlie yours
went a little differently tell us about
that well luckily uh i did my show much
after these two
uh ever done their first show you know
multiple shows retired
so i had these two in my choir in
addition to
broderick um for my first prep which was
uh
my first show which was earlier this
year in may
uh it went pretty well for the most part
the whole prep uh i guess the only big
mistake for me that i think i made was
towards the middle of the prep i was
training a little too hard
uh not accounting for the diet fatigue
um
too close to failure way too close to
failure and trying to maintain the same
amount of volume and consistent
large prs like you would kind of
sometimes expect during a
mass phase
and uh yeah and
as soon as we kind of backed off the
volume and intensity there
things went so you're probably better
and you kept even more muscle when
things got easier yeah so you won the
overall the super heavyweight it's a
local it's a local show it's a massive
local show it's like a thousand a show
with 580 competitors yeah in st louis
the biggest show in the united states
so but charlie has a self-esteem problem
don't worry we'll get to that in the
later videos
anyway
that's our first show experiences
um if you're doing your first show
don't be an idiot like me
hire a coach is my best advice
[Music]
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
that's it reset
[Music]
free motion laterals
shoulder time
free motion laterals or wire raises
these are awesome you can do these
paused at the top you can do them not
pause today we're not pausing just a
fluid motion always control the
eccentric
we're going to do four sets
my goal is 20 reps because i have this
pre-programmed from before these guys
are busy they have to auto regulate the
reps same as with curls it's meyer reps
first set
straight set of 20. after that the other
three sets are however many mini sets my
rep sets with like a few seconds break
between
however many it takes one rep away from
failure to get to the total 20 each time
great way to blast shoulders great way
to do isolations give it a shot let's
get the work in
[Music]
[Music]
fuck
[Music]
[Music]
ugh
oh no better
better
[Music]
so
forearm work usually we do a lot of grip
curling
the rogue wrist roller
thanks rogue excellent piece of
equipment put away at the end straight
away at the ground
we roll up and then we control the
eccentric on the way down
last time i did 10 total rolls
resting as much as i needed between
up and down rolls to get the lactic acid
out just a little
uh this time
12. so i'm gonna get into it and we'll
see what charlie and jared
think about this exercise let's get into
it
ah
[Music]
oh fuck
holy fuck
oh my goodness
