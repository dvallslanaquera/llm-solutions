architecturally very complicated had
very distinct and numerous sub-regions
we have to hit this part then we have to
hit this part then this part this is
known as the nipple area of the chest
maybe that's an area you can hypertrophy
with weights turns out that's not the
case what is the case is that most
exercises and sorry most muscle and
muscle groups have between one and three
main functional elements or angles that
they can be targeted from that actually
differentially cause meaningful
hypertrophy
