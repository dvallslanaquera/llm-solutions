you can no longer make the same gains so
for example beginners can just add five
pounds to the bar and still do sets of
five for like months and as an
intermediate you may try to do that sort
of thing and typically where it took you
three or four months until you just got
tired and needed a break you were still
hitting PRS as a beginner now after two
months you're not tired you don't need a
break but you physically have stopped
making PRS because your body doesn't
adapt as fast anymore it's more
challenging to adapt you've already
adapted quite a bit you're an
intermediate welcome and you have to now
realize that beginner gains are gone
