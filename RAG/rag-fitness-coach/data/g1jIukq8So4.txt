folks dr mike here dom angelo trivellini
fucking trivellini
top npc bodybuilder
on the cusp of his pro card
five foot five and a half
265 pounds so you're always looking
pretty small here i got a
bigger sweatshirt
dom is here at renaissance gym training
shoulders and chest that's the order
we're gonna do it in but a real quick
question to you guys is with a name like
dom is dominic
dominic angelo trevolini where is dom
from
take a fucking guess damn you from
fucking philly right
yeah you're from jersey right nope
you're for fucking queens i've seen you
in fucking queens
brooklyn
sicily
a small town chelsea michigan bullshit
he's a fucking mob undercover guy that's
what he is all right
are we going to finish this workout or
is the mob going to find out we're here
and kill dom for ranting like a fucking
stool pigeon let's find out see you in
the next exercise
[Music]
all right don is training shoulders and
chest today and the way his program is
structured he has one day of the week
where he trains chest and shoulders
chest as the priority chest goes first
today he's training shoulders and chest
shoulders go first so it's a bit of a
different architecture but according to
the specificity principle what you need
to hit most should usually come first
most folks would always say chest before
shoulders but that's actually not
correct if shoulders are your priority
at the time for the workout shoulders go
first our first exercise is free motion
cross body laterals with a pause and
after that we'll do another shoulder
exercise if i'm still breathing we'll do
chest so let's get at this it's going to
be multiple sets probably working
through a bit of a weight range
mostly in the 10 to 15 10 to 20 rep
range but we'll see how things go we
might lighten it up and do a few more
reps at the end
hold it at the top a little longer
yes slow two more dom two more let's
make it good
slow
reach sky high
reach and hold hold slow
down very good folks i want you to see
something dom can you turn uh other way
all the way other way
this
is a fresh stretch mark that means don
has never been this big in his entire
life before it's just cool to see isn't
that neat one last set we're gonna drop
the weight a lot we're going to give dom
a rep goal this is going to be a kind of
maya rep giant set or marathon set
combination the rep goal is going to be
30 total reps the load is going to be
really light he's going to have
opportunities to relax between mini sets
and he's going to do
all the way up to the rep goal the rep
goal seems to be thirty fuck it we'll do
thirty

oh shit
shoulders look pumped
good things are happening
oh man it hurts like a motherfucker
right
and the fun is just beginning who knew
shit one exercise in one exercise
five sets of delts free motion laterals
in the books dom is pumped he's tired we
continue on one more delt exercise today
super rom laterals might as well have
some fun these are humbling
don is fucking gigantic he's like 265
pounds of five five
he's using the 20s today maybe we'll
warm him up with these and go to heavier
i fucking doubt it
do the right technique the critical
thing isn't to go as high as you can go
nice and high so that you feel it
control that eccentric you don't want to
fall down with them you want to slow
them down rips your shoulders apart does
all the good stuff we're probably going
to do another five sets here
we're gonna vary the load a little bit
and we'll probably break down all the
way down until he's using just his arms
seven
shoulders only
eight
do what it takes the technique
nine one more
go go go go slow slow slow
wrap
back
we're gonna do one more set of those
when you're ready and then as soon as
you put them down i want you to pretend
you have dumbbells in your hands and do
another set until your shoulders don't
work cool
go higher
yes slow

try to hate hey dom if someone's coming
by try wave at them and say hello right
now
this is stupid good shit chest time oh
yeah
[Music]
chest time
we said earlier it was going to be three
chest exercises but
at the pace we're going and the muscle
damage we're occurring it might be more
like two auto regulations a good thing
first exercise incline smith machine
barbell press
here's the trick though
that's an arsenal smith machine which
means it weighs like a hundred thousand
times more than normal humbling as fuck
so you can think to yourself hey dumb's
not that strong but irl on a normal
smith machine you're doing what 365 385
for sets of eight some shit like that
405 for seven 405 for seven on a normal
smith machine we'll see how far those
numbers hold up on this one

good full range of motion all the way
through lockout control
yes slow
go
more
go go go go
oh
fuck
take a nice long break next up is the
chest press
[Music]
so we were going to do a whole bunch of
chest exercises we were going to do
three and even an isolation move but it
dawned upon us after actually one set of
incline done with excellent technique
kudos to dom that we're not going to
need that many chest exercises he has to
recover in a few days for chest again as
he trains twice a week so
one more chest exercise probably only
three sets here is going to do the job
two sets a little heavier one set a
little lighter
hip of the whole spectrum the nautilus
impact chest press machine
i ordered this thing for a reason
because it's the fucking bomb
and dom is about to get that explosion
into his chest that sounds way too
sexual for what i meant dom how are you
feeling my chest so fucked up man
it's so pumped
perfect well almost perfect we got more
chest ahead let's get it done
press
fuck yeah dom let's go more
no worries about failing on this machine
will catch you press
good again slow chest up
yes
press
you got more one more slow chest to the
sky
good more one more chest stop chest up
chest up
press
slow as if you're going to do another
rep
big stretch and then shut out
fuck
oh
this stretch is no joke whatever it
takes
you can wiggle and wiggle out as many
times as you need 20 good repetitions
20.
