hey folks it's me Dr Mike from
Renaissance critization and on today's
hypertrophy myths series episode
we'll be talking about overvaluing the
Mind muscle connection
that is mind muscle connection is more
important than everything else
we'll talk about what the myth is talk
about some of the good points it makes
some of the bad which is why it's a myth
and a little bit of real talk at the end
to make sure we're on the same page as
to what actually works well so
this idea that the Mind muscle
connection is ultra Ultra Ultra
important
is not just something that we have
observed that people sort of say they
say it rather directly
so something I've heard many times
read in muscle magazines seen in YouTube
videos and Instagram posts by
professional bodybuilders sometimes
is that you have to focus on the muscle
then don't worry about the weights or
the Reps
another thing people say is bodybuilding
is about making light weights seem heavy
it sounds like some Voodoo something
cool I don't know exactly why that's a
good thing but it has something to do
with how your muscle is sort of exposed
to the weight
and a lot of people will say look don't
chase PRS
don't worry about how strong you are
just make sure that you focus on the
working muscle and that's all you need
now
there are some good Silver Linings in
there
one
is that a strong mind muscle connection
properly done
can enhance the muscle growth potential
of a lift specifically with respect to
the muscle that you are focusing on like
triceps in a skull crusher for example
there are ways to do a skull crusher we
have no idea what the tricep is doing
that aren't ideal for triceps
hypertrophy but if you really clue in on
the right stuff about what the tricep is
doing you can alter the technique and
alter the execution of the lift such
that it actually helps triceps grow more
so there's definitely something there
in addition to that sort of expanding on
it your Technique in an exercise can be
really helped by paying attention to
what the muscle is doing not just moving
from point A to point B
for example if you do some kind of
pressing movement on a machine cable
dumbbells barbell whatever if you just
press up and down that's cool yeah but
you may feel like oh yeah like my pecs
if you pay attention to your what your
picks are doing is saying okay they're
Contracting they're stretching fine but
if you arch your back and you retract
your shoulder blades and then you do a
press
you Guided by mine muscle will be like
wow this really does seem to hit the
packs much more
in every single exercise there are ways
of slightly altering the movement that
will give you more of a feel in the
muscle that you're trying to work and
other ways that will give you less of
one and if you follow the technical
hints at more of the ways that help the
muscle work more you're gonna have a
better time you're gonna be able to do
more of the work for that muscle and get
better results
by doing that
you're lifting the same weight same reps
but you're doing it in a technique that
is Guided by the Mind muscle Connection
by your perception of what's going on
with a Target muscle on the one extreme
it's like I have no idea what my packs
are doing don't care on the other hand
it's like your mind is in the peck your
brain is a giant Peck
could have said that better but on that
end if you allow the feeling of what
really hits the pecs to determine your
Technique you're going to end up with a
technique that probably has a bigger
stimulus to the Target muscle but
because you may feel it lessen your
joints because of that enhanced
technique you actually need fewer
repetitions to get the job done and get
close to failure you may have less
fatigue and more stimulus better
stimulus to fatigue ratio that's a win
that's awesome these are all great
things
however
that's taking a very
Rosy approach
to what exactly the Mind muscle
connection is and how it's supposed to
be done here's the bad stuff
most of the people
that say things like the Mind muscle
connection is everything or it's super
super important
when they say mind muscle connection
they mean the bicep feels like it's
moving and Contracting the muscle feels
like it's moving and Contracting
but that doesn't really mean a whole lot
as far as the stimulus is concerned
because mind muscle connection to be
truly indicative of stimulus of overload
has to be go beyond simple movement and
perception
after all there is a way in which you
can feel your biceps moving and
Contracting during a lat pull down
but your back does most of the work
biceps do a small amount
it ends up being like well yeah the
biceps definitely help they definitely
stretch and contract and you can focus
on them during the pull down but because
of the mechanics of the exercise the
back still does the majority of the work
and gets the majority of the stimulus
so in reality
what you will do is if you really think
feeling a muscle contract and stretch is
the thing beyond all others that tells
you you're doing a good job in the gym
stimulating growth
you're gonna end up doing like yoga or
Pilates and being like now this is a
real workout
yoga will get you to feel every single
muscle stretch and contract depending on
the pose
but it doesn't grow much muscle
because it doesn't push you hard
progressing
on load reps proximity to failure and so
on
so the real way to detect a mind muscle
connection isn't to fail like yeah I
feel my bicep during this that doesn't
mean anything you can feel your bicep
you can do curls with one arm and no
curls with the other unloaded no weight
here dumbbell here like yep things are
happening well I definitely feel my
bicep here too so what there's not even
any weight in there if you really do
mind muscle connection right
you have to use our method we do have an
RP method of defining and determining
mind muscle connection and that is two
part one
do you and to what extent do you feel
tension in the Target muscle
high tension like holy crap my bicep is
pulling like crazy and both bones at
which it's attached to
and two is the burn especially for
higher reps that's towards the end if
your biceps are burning during a
movement and you can feel a ton of
tension during them through that
movement
you do have a mind muscle connection but
it's of the kind that makes it likely
that you're growing why because tension
literally causes muscle growth and the
burn is indicative of both getting close
enough to failure to cause muscle growth
it's also indicative of the fact that
that's for sure the muscle that's the
limiting factor
and metabolites themselves are growth
promoting like the burn actually is a
symptom of the kind of molecules in
there that do turn on growth Pathways
like lactate for example
that's the way to do mind muscle
connection not just oh I feel this
muscle
feeling is nice but again if you go by
feeling you may end up doing um and look
with all due respect no offense
wussy ass bikini workouts where you get
on the assisted pull-up machine and you
do that one leg like
stomp down thing pedal push and I got my
God I really feel my glutes like yes
they are moving how far from failure is
that is it even possible for you to
mechanically load the glute enough where
if you did you would stand up off the
machine because it's by definition that
machine setup less load than your body
weight are you so weak that body weight
lunges don't work of course not that's
the kind of shit the Mind muscle
connection gets really wrong it is not
enough to feel your muscle working
has to be working with a shitload of
tension through it and hopefully it
higher wraps a crapload of burn now
that's not that fun
but it's the right kind of mind muscle
connection
if
the Mind muscle connection
of feeling the muscle work is how you
get to a good technique fine but then on
top of that you have to layer in
additions of load over the weeks and or
additions of repetitions per set you
have to continue to make each set harder
in a measurable way
step one okay I know this works my packs
step two let's actually make sure I'm
doing the work
if you don't do that second part you'll
do all kinds of cool flies and presses
and yeah I really feel it you guys
people will do that shit where they get
on the machine sideways and they'll put
the one arm on the share let me get my
fucking pecs bro word up how many reps
do you do this week how many last week
well looks like you underloaded you have
to progress thus the training sure
absolutely you have to not have to I'll
take that back it's better if you feel
the muscle working than not it's even
better if you feel it it's highly tensed
or highly burned
but within those contexts you also have
to make sure it's progressing so when
people say dude just think about the
muscle Contracting in these cable curls
don't worry about how many reps you're
doing how much load that's good and well
if you're doing a warm-up set where
you're teaching the technique but once
you're doing the work sets you got to
grind and for a specific purpose and to
a specific point I did 10 reps last week
this week it's 11. I did 105 pounds last
week this week it's 110. something so
the Mind muscle connection doesn't
predominate over everything as a matter
of fact that core of good technique with
load and rep progression is the thing
mind muscle connection is something you
oh magic fairy dust you sprinkle on it
and the best flavor of magic fairy dust
is tension and burn
a shitty not so great flavor is just
feeling the muscle existing
cool but like you should be able to do
that anyways like being a human being
and knowing where your body is in space
fuck if I know anything about that
the best mind muscle connection occurs
when you perceive tension and burn
and you progress in load and Reps with
that technique that maximizes tension
and burn with every single rep closer to
failure
a lot of times people start with a good
technique but then they'll kind of like
try to get away from it because it's too
much
they use their biceps a ton on the first
couple reps they're like oh my God this
hurts my biceps I'm gonna flare my
elbows out a little bit use some other
muscles too if I can take the tension
off the buys wrong
so mind muscle connection use properly
is not an alternative
to the pain and the suffering that comes
with pushing a set with excellent
technique close to failure that lack of
Escape mind muscle connection is not an
off-ramp my muscle connection is
something that helps you stay in the
lane
and make sure you're going as fast as
possible down that highway of death and
destruction that is a set very close to
failure so it's not so much oh Hey
listen don't worry about the Reps and
load
think about mind muscle connection
it's actually a little bit different it
is hey
goal wraps and goal load are super
fucking important but every single rep
you do had to better be tension and burn
in the Target muscle and thus we check
both boxes
that is a really good idea
real talk
yes the Mind muscle connection people
have a point it is possible to push so
hard for reps and load that you lose
total Touch of your muscles total touch
from your Technique and you're just
moving around on space look you can go
to any gym in America and the world and
see some guy benching and be like that's
for his pecs
three four five reps six rep that's for
his soul that's for his ego that's for
his future injuries that's for his
ex-girlfriend time to go save him cause
the shit goes from here
this kind of shit guys trying to bring
their leg up to bench with that's for
sure nonsense
don't do that instead what you can do
is during the warm-ups really try to
feel which muscles are working
you won't get a ton of tension or a ton
of burn because it's warm-ups the time
for that original old school style
muscle can my muscle connection is in
the warm-ups
set that technique
begin to do repetitions with an
appropriate load with the goal of
hitting a mini PR relative to last
session last week
and then as you do that let tension and
burn be your canaries in the coal mine
they fly in hopefully they fly back out
let them guide you
to how to make sure your Technique stays
on track
yes elbows in I told myself that and oh
my fucking god this tension is crazy ah
the burn blah blah blah instead of oh
tension and burn I don't want this pain
I'm gonna let my elbows flare out
the best way to gains
is critical
set in stone hard fucking training with
good technique and then on top of that
the way you stay in good technique is
monitoring your tension and your burn
and yes there is a place in warm-ups for
just feeling the muscle out to make sure
your Technique is really good
but it ends there and once the work set
starts it's all pain all day you know
the real psychic kind of pain you don't
ever recover from you're sleeping trying
to go to bed at night and you just feel
about set three man
set three of hack squats hurt me in a
way
maybe I'll never recover from
you know
but I'll be okay
but just never the same you know
you know like kids playing with a
balloon and he lets go and he's like
Mommy Mommy look up
you come up to the kid and you're like
you know see that balloon that's never
coming back
it's like a part of me that I lost
during hack squatting
and the lady's like what the fuck are
you doing talking to my kid taser and
then you're out for the 50th time that's
why I don't hang out at playgrounds
