you can get all of the benefits of
exercise with oxygen therapy without
spending a dime just learning how to
breathe
properly F would I dude if I was aing
person who sold the oxygen machine I'd
be pissed what the hell are you going to
buy this 10,000 20,000 $80,000 machine
for if you could
just do this and that learn how to
breathe properly for 10 minutes a day
and you get all the benefits like the
machines or the yield that they
give you much higher if it's much lower
is it worth the money like if I said
like look if you want to be in good
shape you need a pull down station a
squat rack and some dumbbells an incline
bench and you got 95% of the we to
awesome shape and you were like yeah but
what about some super fancy machines I
wouldn't say like this is an amazing
fancy machine and here's how it works to
improve your I'd say you don't
really need to do that so how is he on
the one hand saying look you got all
this fancy but on the other hand
being like yeah you don't need any of
this so why the does uh Dana White have
it I don't get it just want to spend
free money for no reason at all
