today I want to talk a little bit about
a hormone that your body might be low on
it's not testosterone is it which is
testosterone fuck how did I know that
now the good news is good news there are
easy things that you can do from home
and I'm going to tell you about a couple
of natural herbs they're super powerful
they are not super powerful okay I'll
start with the actual science there is
no natural herb that dependably raises
your testosterone in a measurable way
that has been confirmed multiply through
a plethora of studies not fenugique or
fenugreek or whatever not any other
weird sounding shit not Tribulus not
shit sorry herbs don't do pretty much
shit in almost any situation there are
no natural herbs to raise your
testosterone levels
