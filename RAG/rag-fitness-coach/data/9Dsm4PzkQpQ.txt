all right good luck getting up
[Music]
all right folks
this is Kevin he tells me he competes in
men's physique which I feel like what a
lot of big men's physiques out there is
what I'm trying to say hybrid there you
go I compete as you guys all know rather
unsuccessfully in open bodybuilding
Jared feather is of course Very classic
look at how classy is and it turns out
you know what I'm saying we got beef
because Kevin looked at Jared one day
and he was like I don't like how your
face looks stop looking at me and Jared
was like you think you have a big chest
huh like no no no sign the papers let's
get this on video crazy chest workout
and this gentleman has a brand that's
called shut up and stuff shut up and
suffer and we'll see if Mr Kevin does
just that or if we get a few whimpers
out of him let's get to it
you have any any injuries you got to
work around or anything pretty good no
I'm pretty good okay you're down to do
whatever
Scott let's get out of here and get to
the orgy then we're going to go to
nordics
all right you see that he put it in the
wrong way how long have we been training
a few times
I said well I'm waiting the wrong hole
all right folks big chest workout memes
probably a few other muscles after this
but we begin often not always but
definitely today with a compound
incline press get the upper packs get
the whole packs going it's going to be
really good today we're going to do
Smith machine process just because Jared
says the machine here is pretty nice and
we're worth a try Jared and Kevin will
get at it sets of 10 to 20 reps watch
for this technique
slow controlled gentle pause full range
of motion let's get to it
doesn't make it a lot harder I apologize
but soft pause on the top soft pulse go
down go down right here tension
again
once you touch your chest but barely
pause
go push
oh yeah sheesh
hell yeah that's what we want to see
right there that's it okay that's the
whole workout we're Gucci we're done
just kidding there's like 10 more
seconds
so you guys will notice on here that
Jared is going to really push his chest
up really retract his shoulder blades
nice powerful Arch so you can press from
a big platform he's going to descend to
very slowly he's gonna pause at the
bottom of the chest and he's going to
come all the way up in a pretty
explosive manner but it's accelerating
from the chest it's not an explosion
and
just kind of wish I looked like that I
put in years to this years of fucking
effort look at me I look like fucking
home or something
six a couple more you got this
okay one more come on
pause up go go go go rack
fuck beautiful briefing that's it let's
just talk yeah
no no no another heavy set like that
he's fast twitch guy uh we have a sort
of an option here to keep going and
doing heavy sets for Kevin or to sort of
let him cook it heavy sort of five to
ten rep range which he's in now or to
reduce the weight and bump him into a
higher rep range and we're just going to
take a rough guess that is a high
proportion of fast push muscle fibers on
was I correct about that sweet
you know what I'm saying and uh that
means that he's probably gonna benefit
from some lower reps that's just like
this so we're going to leave him here
for a while these low wrap sets tend to
hit you pretty well so that's a five to
ten mess you up there you go correct
guess we're gonna get at it for a while
and later we're gonna do some high rep
stuff
two to four minute rest periods on heavy
compound stuff the deeper I get into
prep the more intensity techniques like
super sets and shit like that I'm
throwing in so the rest beards are
shortened I'm just trying to get a
really good pump
so
longer rest periods in the front of the
workout and generally you reduce them as
the workout goes on because you're going
into like isolation shit or and that's
what I usually do yeah like the first
two exercises have everything else is
yeah it's quick like 30 seconds yeah
we'll do something similar yeah
good stuff Jared oh boy
one more heavy set for uh Kevin yeah
perfect keep going
chest up
gotta pause longer that was really good
pause wait good a little longer wait
let's make this one count chest up
up
we're here to work big slow slow slow
slow slow pause up
one more I'm right here with you do your
best
can I stop
up go
go go go
yeah try my best not to sink that was
good that was to failure
all set here
you know when it gets hard that's what
you want to do so you can use your chest
as a springboard so when you're pausing
on the top of the chest I was about to
on the last one
that's why I'm here call you on that
bullshit
flies next year yup
[Music]
thank you
oh they're full of the Soaps I mean the
worst well at least it's gonna be very
clean I'll just get the fuck off
so you're opening up to that wall and
you're trying to keep the most people
only fly they go like this yeah they're
trying to keep it out to that wall and
really use the pecs put a whole range of
motion
incline pressing is done four sets there
now we're gonna get into four sets of
machine chest flies these are awesome
set them for a big stretch full
contraction a pause at the top different
kind of force curve for the chest
they're usually experienced with
something like dumbbell flies which
gravity doesn't affect at the top and
all the way controlled big chest at the
bottom there's a temptation to collapse
at the bottom don't do that leverage
your chest up
shoulders back and then feel free to
cave in Jared is teaching the technique
here where you stay retracted even all
the way up that makes it really hard but
super effective for the packs multiple
sets here of anywhere between 5 and 15
usually between 10 and 15 reps and a
little super bonus to the end of these
sets we're going to superset them with
wide grip push-ups probably to a deficit
really fry up the whole thing let's get
to it slow should I stop stop
go all the way cut your fingers together
there you go slow chest up chest up
chest up chest up chest up hold Rock
good stuff man
packs look like they're popping out of
the skin
big chest
foreign
let's go
yes Jared a couple more man let's do
this
yes
[Music]
yes
oh
gotta pause at the top make the squad
possible with three seconds at the top
go
three seconds hold one two three and
slow slow chest up chest up chest up and
rack right away here for push-ups up
button stomach up use the chest there
you go slow slow slow slow slow
deep deeper pause
pause
[Music]
go one more bonus round down let's go
down super deep time to suffer a little
bit
up okay rack
good enough
good stop so if you want to expose your
chest a little more to the exercise
instead of being here
Palestine keep your butt and stomach
back I mean like this here and then
you're using all pecs yeah like this
like this stretch stretch instead of
being here yeah I'm singing yeah let's
just make the exercise way too easy so
here you're strong right here all chest
all chest stretch stretch
that makes sense because you're not when
you come down this is the first thing
you do
right that's like completely taken you
were more stretched here than you were
here so you're here you want to maintain
that stretch
the whole way through instead of being
here that literally takes the stretch
off
think about that as you're doing it when
you feel this shit start going toward
the floor
well
go hold it up there hold it what the
fuck was that that was zero zero whoa
and that's it right to the push-ups go
let's go good stuff man there you go
Kevin that's perfect man that's some
happy shit right there
right down again zero rest at the top
barely lock out and come back up
down slow
deep
wait up down right away
deep on the way up don't sink deep use
the patch up
one more one more one more get the fuck
back up let's go let's go all day all
day warrior shit today slow controlled
deep I want that stretch
wait for it
okay kick those out just push-ups on the
ground one down
two more slow pause up
one more go
slow
[Music]
wait use the pet up
oh yeah come on
all right good luck getting up
I think my chest grew just being close
to that so Kevin has the interesting
opposite problem that I have
he's not supposed to train his arms
according to his coach
he says he does it about once a month
so we're gonna use it today as that one
time and Shoma attractive exercise that
he probably hasn't done
[Music]
hey folks so Jared is going to be
warming up and
ends training the Smith machine skull
crusher just another variation but you
guys can try it Kevin's going to try it
today Jared is going to get it so that
more or less the bar lines up just under
his chin and he's going to keep his
elbows in as much as he can on the way
down he's a little big so that's hard
the rest of you can probably push your
elbows in further he's going to control
the eccentric on the way down pushing
his elbows towards his hips the entire
time it's like for quads if you're
squatting you want your knees to be
pushed forward as you go down same ear
with elbows elbows forward and in all
the way deep into pause and then all the
way up it's that simple give it a shot
you'll have to adjust the Smith machine
positioning ability to get it right but
once you get it right
fucking beautiful hey hey sharers hey
all right get out of here he said he has
elbow issues when he does skull crusher
so I asked him does he do them like
everybody else which when you see people
do skulls they lie down and they go like
this or some shit uh this is probably a
little better for elbows I've at least
found anecdotally for myself and clients
and stuff
putting your elbows behind your body
like this and putting them in that
position it's really weird a lot of
people just kind of let that weight drop
behind him a bunch and it's just like
ripping on your elbow shitload this is a
little more controlled I like it more
watching you try to demo overhead looks
like you're getting that mic isn't a
level of Mobility oh yeah for sure right
now yeah yeah well I was demonstrating
lying down that's me lying down shoving
it behind my head like most people do
I'll shove something lying down slow
gobbles in yes big pause up
oh one more let's go Kevin slow I got
you I'm right here slow elbows in
big pause
up
one more bonus round reposition there
you go hit it slow elbows in slow it
down
big pause fight him in on the way up too
press rap
hell yeah
tell me you feel that yeah
especially on the bottom yeah yeah yeah
Big Stretch all the way through here
that sounds good
all right so as soon as you're done with
your triceps set I'll let you know I'm
gonna rack reposition super quick still
grip here and here close grip bench
press
right away as many as you can I'll talk
you through that so just first good
technique here
again
[Music]
slow
press go go one more last one elbows in
nobody said rest elbows in awesome
there you go slow pause up okay yep go
go
good slide up a little bit slow slow
impossible really Chuck the elbows tuck
the shit out of them
Up full lockout good
slow
again go slow you're the fucking man
this is how muscle grows
up one more slow slow elbows in
hop into a full lockout
full full fold slow down to go go down
down down down down elbows in elbows in
elbows in
up
oh shit
we got the chills on that one I know
literally
that was funny
that's a good look you guys want to hit
some poses together real quick for the
camera sure well there's a good lighting
over here
the way to have a big chest is to do
clearly shit like these guys are doing
holy crap amazing workout Kevin what'd
you think it was awesome awesome I
thought I knew how to train chess but I
was clearly wrong
compared to what you normally do yeah
like how much how many less working sets
did we do a lot less usually I'm doing
like at least 30. you want to do some
more of that oh no no no no no no no no
I was done after the first exercise
so that's good stuff dude you were a
pleasure to train your Technique was
instantly Flawless amazing easy to coach
awesome awesome that was awesome all
around good pleasure for us yeah what
about this guy I don't appreciate him
too much I told you the color of the day
was blue and purple you you come in here
wearing red you know what I'm saying you
just got to be different that's what
always like that's my biological son
when he was growing up he was always
trying to be different anyway guys give
Kevin a follow he's a big deal clearly
follow his brand
um lived up to it today that's your damn
sure you know if you're trying to suffer
and shut up about it this is a guy to
follow and get a shot about it
