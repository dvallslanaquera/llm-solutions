hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and today's hypertrophy
myths video
is about a salacious topic that's right
Google that word
the myth is that the big guys have some
kind of really special insight into how
to grow muscle and thus you should
really really really
prioritize what they're saying over what
other people are saying about how to get
jacked we're going to break this down as
usual we're going to talk about what the
myth really is
talk about some of the Silver Linings
all myths have a little bit of Truth to
them
even most
you know people say like oh I can see
ghosts
I don't know I'm where the Silver Lining
is for that
I guess in the realization that the the
brain is uh what a hell of a
hallucinogen
but uh yeah in any case most most myths
have something to teach us then we're
going to talk about the bad stuff which
is the stuff that makes it mythical and
thus mostly bullshit and a little bit of
real talk to sort of close
the loop on this discussion okay so the
myth
is most of the people saying stuff
like
that guy's huge he must really know
how to train and diet super well
you can do there's definitely something
there right okay so not entirely wrong
and then they'll say like yeah science
nerds say you know x y z
this big guy at my gym says ABC so I'm
gonna go with him man because he's huge
he's living a life like all right
and then there's another brand of
statement like something like you know
man if the science nerds really knew
stuff they'd be huge too they'd all be
the biggest guys
and I have mostly said by people who
you know gee maybe School wasn't their
number one thing in life
don't worry I'll have more insults to
people's intelligence later in this
episode
all right
the good and there's lots of good
big guys clearly know something that
worked
they're doing something that clearly
worked
as they're big
and this whole thing of hypertrophy is
we're all trying to get big but clearly
they're onto something
we actually know what they're on to at
the very least most of them will know
and be able to actually sort of
declaratively say
consistency is important
progression is important showing up to
the gym regularly very rarely we have a
big idea man in this two years because
of covet that's not gonna work
progression big guys are usually good
about putting some more weight on the
bar every now and again adding a rep or
two here and there adding some sets
challenging themselves
and of course they're pretty good at
hypercalorically dieting with plenty of
protein you don't get to 240 pounds in
most cases just by eating normally and
being like yeah this is just like how I
eating ta-da
usually you have to eat lots of food so
they know about that they know about
eating when they don't want to eat and
they know that protein is important
usually at the very least
consistency progression in a hyper
caloric diet
is more than most people know
and a lot of even you know smart gym
nerds could use a Bastion on the head
with this every now and again because
people get exotic into this crazy
periodization shit and what about this
one exercise for the lap that hits your
lap this way okay how many times you
train your last a week like well I've
just been playing around a little bit
like okay great so you don't actually
train got it
there's some shit there there are some
reality there
and on the other end
science nerd folks
often say a lot of stuff that just
doesn't work in real life
because they haven't tried it yet
or never tried it no plans to try it
they'll just say stuff
and
maybe because they tried it
but they didn't grow
but they have such shitty genetics and
work ethic anyway
that growth isn't something they're
going to be doing much
a lot of times you'll get this
especially with older folks muscle nerds
that are in their 40s probably just
won't ever be growing again and they'll
recommend a variety of training
practices and rirs and progressions that
look interesting on paper
but uh they haven't tried them nor will
they ever if they have and are trying
them it doesn't much matter because
they're not in that phase of their life
where net growth is even possible
outside of using tons of steroids or
something like that
so
the last thing I'll say here is you
don't have to religiously believe and
don't worry we'll get to that in a sec
what the big guys say and what they do
is like the way to do things
and not everything that comes out of
their mouths is something you're going
to want to do
but you ignore the practices especially
of the big guys to your detriment
I want to know
what all the big guys are doing
that doesn't mean I'm gonna do it all
I care a lot about what they're doing I
care much less about what they're saying
because their words didn't get them
muscle their actions did much more
curious about what they're doing
and then I can sort of put the puzzle
pieces together I'll never ignore it
when tons of bodybuilders do some kind
of practice there is absolutely chance
that it's just dumbest fuck it's the new
fat
but there's also a chance like man
they're really out of something and I
wouldn't want it to be like yeah they're
all idiots don't worry about it no no
you should know about it but then you
should have a good sort of working
Concept in your brain that accepts
tentatively or rejects ideas from
bodybuilding that oh yeah like these big
guys this is something to try they're
discovering something interesting
on the other hand some stuff you see
from them you'll be like that guy's a
fucking idiot there's no way that works
I tried it it doesn't work biomechanics
says it doesn't work physiology says it
doesn't work
people do some dumb shit here's more on
that
the bad stuff
it is super important to realize the
following
I will place my uh
reputation as a science Communicator or
whatever the fuck I am uh on this idea
the top reasons the biggest guys are who
they are looks like this
number one and I do mean number one
amazing genetics
okay
very good genetics at least
number two
time spent training hard
and I mean years
that's how long it takes to get big
you almost certainly big guys have
really good genetics
and have trained hard for years now that
does not mean the details of their
training are remotely optimal
that doesn't mean the details of the
training got them as big as they could
have been
that doesn't mean that the details of
the training won't get you hurt
and they just got lucky
they just trained a long time the
details not so important
number three is that they know how to
eat in the sense that they've spent a
lot of time eating
and gaining weight it does not have to
be remotely ideal
one of the stupidest fucking things
you'll ever see in your life I ever saw
in my life when they do like day in the
life of a bodybuilder and they'll be
like yeah I'm eating a lot of fish and
the comments are like why fishing not
chicken
what the fuck are you talking about do
you know how many bodybuilders got big
off chicken well everyone else
so what's the what's the thing with fish
it cannot be a good answer there there
does not exist a good answer never mind
that on the nutritional physiology the
proteins all get broken down in amino
acids anyway and as long as the amino
acid score is high which it is both high
for fish and chicken it doesn't fucking
matter it doesn't make basically any
difference on hypertrophy but you'll
always get people that want the details
all right Nick Walker does not have 23
inch arms because he ate like fish
versus chicken
forget about that shit he does have
fucking 23 inch arms or however the
fucking big they are is because he ate a
lot of food when he didn't feel like
eating a lot of food he got up to like
300 pounds on a few occasions and voila
big ass arms that's what you can take
away from something like that the
details hey look sometimes may be very
good but they'll have to be explained in
a way that makes sense
it's not the details to get most people
jacked
lastly
folks that are really jacked oftentimes
take anywhere from some
two lots of drugs
and it doesn't even have to be remotely
an ideal protocol design
I've seen some of the protocols on good
word from top Olympians
some of them look fucking ridiculous
tons of compounds that do more or less
the same thing
tons of variety and compounds where you
don't need it
tons of compounds introduced way too
early taken out way too late ones that
contradict each other
but mostly what matters about how
generally jacked you get from drugs is
like how many drugs you do like if you
take 500 Megs a week you'll get pretty
jacked take a thousand you'll get more
Jack two thousand more Jack four
thousand more jacked five thousand
Hospital
or some shit like that there is a rich
piano limit
R.I.P
in any case
genetics
training hard for years eating a ton for
years and taking sometimes loads of
drugs are such powerful effectors and
such powerful mediators of muscle size
that they explain a huge fraction not
all but maybe like 80 to 90 percent of
the reason that the biggest guys in the
gym are bigger than you
notice that nothing on that list
is a nuanced technical knowledge about
rir going to failure technique for
exercises exercise selection exercise
selection interaction like do I do rows
after deadlifts or before workout splits
frequencies taper designs accumulation
none of that shit
here's the problem here's where the myth
comes from a lot of times we go to our
biggest guys for those very things be
like hey what do you think about like a
double progression
does that make that on the fucking list
no
so anytime you ask a huge guy you can be
sure they know these things and do them
everything else
it's up in the air and a lot of times
I'm gonna say something kind of mean
you know more of the nuances than they
do
because you are 24 years old and you
took uplifting two years ago
and you did starting shrinks for six
months so now you're into RP or whatever
with 3dmj whatever you're into
and you're a mechanical engineer by
trade that's your day job which means
sorry
forgive me you are a category or two
smarter
than the average jacked person at your
gym
you're just smarter and you have access
to reading and viewing video materials
that talk about reps and and loads and
manipulations and failure proximities
that is an intellectual Stratosphere
that many of these people that are super
jacked they don't even have the ability
to process that data that's like me
trying to listen to a Lex Friedman
podcast about some guy talking about
like python codes fuck if I know python
all I know is you need to stick to that
motherfucker get away from me snake
apparently there's the code in there and
the C's and pluses and more pluses I
don't know any of that shit I just have
no clue
a lot of times if you ask a fucking
super Jack dude at the gym details on
shit
and he starts to sound real dumb or
contradictory don't worry he probably
doesn't have some special Richard
feynman-like Insight on the shit that
nobody else got unlikely
the guy that does this and ah does this
and does that and voila and now you're
asking about shit it's just not in his
wheelhouse to know
if you was at your intellectual level
that's right you he would be at that and
it would then you would be talking to
John Jew at ifbb Pro or Jared feather
ISB Pro or 10 other guys I could mention
that are real fucking sharp and then you
would get a great answer but it's not a
guarantee
not even close
so
how can we use the wisdom of the big
guys in context I think it's probably a
good idea
to let the big guys remind you a few
things
like
training hard is important
training hard consistently for years is
even more important
eating well is important eating well
consistently for years is important
like if you go and eat well and then you
got to go to an engineering conference
in Europe for two weeks and you barely
eat it all you barely train it all you
come back you've lost a shitload of
muscle motherfucker that's on you you
should have been fucking flipping
through your Instagram and Tick Tock of
pro bodybuilders and be like oh yeah I'm
one of these people
bodybuilders that is let me find a gym
here in Munich or some shit like that
let me get some fucking protein in my
face that shit fucking matters
the people that do the best in the sport
long term the people just get most Jack
long term are the motherfuckers that
they take breaks here and there a couple
weeks here and there but they just
generally don't quit
and also remember when looking at the
pros that drugs and genetics matter a
lot so if you watch like something like
coach casim's shit I'm like how to
fucking hit the lats
and you're like man that's really
insightful shit and you seem to think
it's a good idea
then you see some jacked up bodybuild at
the gym doing half bent over roses and
you're like huh it doesn't seem like it
really hits the lats all that well does
this guy know something casim doesn't no
fuck no but that instant of seeing him
can remind you that genetics are a hell
of a thing and drugs are a hell of a
thing and just doing this with good
units and drugs when you eat a lot and
you do this day in and day out for
several years you will get jacked is it
the most optimal fuck no is it efficient
hell no will you probably get hurt doing
it yes
so do not copycat that shit
speaking of copycatting
what if you want specific information
are sets of 10 better than sets of 15.
is 2 IR better than going to failure any
shit like that
are the big guys good sources of info
probably not
they can be good sources of info
but not reliably better than just
regulars
at least semi-intelligent people that
train and read stuff on the internet
they just don't have much more of an
insight and they certainly don't know
more than the science nerds in the
industry
so for example I'll just give you an
individual Eric Trexler Google him look
him up
not a big guy he weighs like 160 or
something
it's five seven five eight just just the
guy you've been shredded a shit before
for competition but he's not enormous
you see him training in a sweatshirt at
your gym and you see Jude juice had MC
pimplestein over here
mama said you had my pimplestein where's
the mirror hey is that funny to you
Scott the video guy you anti-semitic
fuck
there's a bit of tension this is the
last Warfare here in the studio
oh Freudian slip
you would look at Jews had MC
pimplestein and be like holy fuck that
guy knows things and somebody be like
did you know that that's Eric's actually
but the fuck is that that guy right
there like uh-huh but there's no way he
did yeah oh yeah
10 times more Eric Trexler knows than
this fucking guy right here almost
certainly but how can you tell well you
Google his shit and you start reading
and you're like holy fuck this guy's
smart as fuck this shit makes a lot of
fucking sense man
if you're a thinker if you're just a
fucking wild animal fucking don't read
shit reading's boring them letters are
all weird shape why can't I be all the
same shape why should gotta be so
confusing is what I'm trying to say
so
definitely
have your ear to the street
definitely know what the big guys are
doing
more and what they're saying a little
less but still be in the know since you
don't miss any obvious good gems
at the same time look to the science
nerds read their shit for sure watch
their videos podcasts
and then
synthesize the two shits through your
own experience
to come up with the best answer
science nerds get shit wrong they get
all theoretical and then they're fucking
small
jacked up Juice Head dudes get shit
wrong all the fucking time because they
have no idea what's going on it's like
asking a fish how it swims what doesn't
even have a can't verbally communicate
language and some pros can't do that
either
at the end of the day
there's no religion in bodybuilding
other than Scientology
will they sue us for that Scott
uh
uh I was busy on the Scientology jokes
in any case there's no Dogma what's that
Westborough Baptist Church they'll come
after you right
in any case just do shit
that passes all of your filters
which means you've experienced it and it
seems to work it makes sense from basic
logic perspective like the fucking nerds
say
and also it seems like at its core it's
something that would seem like it would
work for the pros and the big guys if
they knew about it slash they sort of do
it anyway
if that all mixes in great we don't want
you to do is being like fucking work for
Ronnie it's working for me
you can fucking do better than that and
definitely don't be the guy that's like
I read in a study at Cogburn 1965 in the
Journal of Master science that you're
not supposed to shut up get out of here
nerd here's your fucking school lunch in
your face
get to the gym
in any case I think I've offended just
about everyone including myself
like subscribe comment
hit that notification Bell I've been
watching some other YouTubers and they
say things like that and uh we've got a
member section with more nerd shit but
also people are Juiced up in it too
supposed to kind of Juiced up everywhere
on this channel
see you guys next time
