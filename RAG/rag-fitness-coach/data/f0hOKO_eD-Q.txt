you're moving your shoulders and trying
to use way too many other muscles
go to the 60 second exit like you're
just trying to get it up
okay if you use less weight and get more
out of it why not
[Music]
yo YouTube what up
we got Jorge
we got Dylan we have the United States
of America and we have formally
Venezuela
and uh formerly the Soviet Union but
since communism is objectively terrible
get triggered in the comments
we're here in newly minted American
citizen Lex Lewis's Dragon's Lair gym
and we're gonna train chest and we're
gonna do it sign Style
these guys here are team full ROM lifers
they are the pristine epitome of
unbelievable technique
not sure you believe me let's go train
chest and find out where's your feather
where's he at he'll be here he'll be
here I have a feeling about him let's go
train
[Music]
[Music]
incline dumbbell press for Dylan for
Jorge it's going to be flat dumbbell
press you guys are going to notice a few
things one is the guys are always
controlling The Eccentric two is they go
for a super deep stretch when guys stop
trying to keep their elbows in for Peck
activation or whatever which may have
its merits a lot of times they'll stop
way above if you go that extra three
inches you guys know that shit is
important
one and a half inches for me I've never
been hard around a woman no the music
stopped in any case
it's important to get that extra deep
stretch and then coming out of it to get
that full range all the way at the top
various parts of that are more important
than others The Eccentric can control is
the most important the next most
important possibly tide for importance
is getting that deep stretch if you come
up and go almost all the way to lockout
no big deal at all as long as you can
replicate that rep you're good to go you
don't have to lock out your chest reps
if you feel a better stimulus to fatigue
ratio with that partial bottom ROM but
there is zero excuse for not stretching
at maximum at the weight I hate a ton of
the guys doing it are totally cool we
all have a different way to train but I
hate hate hate when guys stop their
chest presses needlessly hi motherfucker
I know you can go lower and I know you
can get that deep stretch on the facts
and I know that'll cause you more
soreness and growth in everything that
is good
so next time you want to do partial reps
do them at the bottom Instead at the top
make it hard on yourself that easy make
the target the Pack's not easy let's go
do some work
there it is
holy shit holy shit there we go as if
another there you go JK
that's like everything good stuff man
they don't pay no better than me oh I
know yeah I just like looking at cues
for myself now
he's with my client for two years Dylan
was applying for a lot of studs man this
is spoiling us Rock
by pushing your chest up
you're moving your shoulders a shitload
you're trying to use way too many other
muscles
good nice and deep
especially the chest chest in the
ceiling right now
it's gonna be it's gonna be harder
Justin Timberlake
all right go to the 60s thank you
go to 60 Seconds
I want you to push your pecs to the
ceiling and just use your pecs as you're
pressing you're going like this
like you're just trying to get it up
fuck that shit if you can use less
weight and get more out of it why not
yeah
way to melt that pause till I'm holy
crap niggas possible for us techniques
to be even better than last time big
chest yes
[Music]
come on
anybody using the packs right off the
bottom
chest to the ceiling there you go make
it hard
it's supposed to be
the chest Warrior the ceiling to the
ceiling to the ceiling right now yes
smooth
[Music]
swelling ceiling ceiling ceiling
the last time we trained together like a
month and a half ago uh Jared had
mentioned something to me about like
watching my technique he's like
uh you know how many more weeks do you
have and he essentially told me like I
had technical failure with the target
muscle and then I actually like let my
chest kind of came down and went beyond
it so like this last couple of months
I'm just really really focusing on
maintaining good technique throughout
the whole set and uh it is
so much harder like a three RAR with
like not allowing your Technique
slipping is like the amount of effort
that takes in like the amount of focus
it takes and just like the actual
attention you feel through the pecs
instead of like frontal triceps I mean
like the Persia far right but uh it also
is just like it just takes a lot more
Consciousness even with the 90s you did
a really fucking good job thank you yeah
reach reach
oh yes
beautiful
hi you've been high
don't get hard You're Gonna Want to cave
in yes
stable
big chest your chest it just the chest
the whole time
reach up no bullshit chest don't move
your fucking shoulders
yes
your flat dumbbell press
so flawless
that if flat dumbbell presses were women
you be Kim Kardashian of this
motherfucker
thank you man appreciate it all your
nerves funny enough the thing that I
improved a ton my technique execution I
have to give a huge shout out to Jimmy
this is gonna get edited right out I
thought they had good technique onto the
train with
respectively they did flat and incline
dumbbell press fast finished sets of 10
to 15 for that now it's time to probably
again more sets of 10 to 15 with the
flat machine press we are using a model
of the Dragon's Lair arguably maybe not
even arguably the best gym in Las Vegas
and uh there is this press here called
The Matrix press machine it costs a
zillion dollars it's a fucking great
machine
slight downsides is that I personally
don't like converging presses I think
because most of the emphasis has to be
on the stretch anyway the converging
kind of takes away from that and makes
you focus on the contraction needlessly
also if you're large especially if
you're Dylan's size you can run into
your own pecs and you can't even do a
big contraction so that's maybe not
ideal also the handles are independent
they can move independently it's cool to
do one-arm vessels due to that sort of
thing but there's a bit of a
coordination problem or really a lot of
your bandwidth goes to coordinating the
movement and I would I would rather be
one fixed pressing Implement so you
could really gear in instead of having
to do this stability otherwise the
machine height is very variable the seat
is very variable so you can get a really
good stretch and the handles are really
comfortable and the Machine is very
smooth so if you come to Dragon's Lair
try the Matrix chest press really fucks
with it until you can get the deepest
stretch in the world and hold it for a
minute or a minute good God hold it for
a second each time at the bottom you
might find some really good results
Big Stretch for forward
slow big chest
yes
[Music]
as if another
[Music]
chest up
chest up
thank you
fast thank you let's go picture the
chest finish finish finish the other one
yeah nice and slow big chest hold that
stretch at the bottom
good oh shit yeah
come on dude
you guys will notice that on a lot of
the lifts we cue the guys in by saying
as if another as if you're gonna do
another concentric you load The
Eccentric to prepare and then you let go
why it's not a big deal but if you did
all the work for the concept you're
gonna wait is in position to give you an
eccentric amazing stimulus that last rep
you're already muscle fibers are very
close to failure all the fastest motor
twitch uh units are on they're active
their muscles are ready to grow at last
eccentric half rep super deep and pause
at the bottom if you do it properly and
expose your chest or whatever muscle
you're doing then it's a lot of
hypertrophy for half a repetition that's
probably the most productive half rep
that you do The Eccentric part of the
wrap that you do the entire set so why
just let it go right I guess terrible
analogy is like you know finish off a
date with this girl leading him like uh
and you're just like and she's like okay
we could have made out and you're like
you set up the whole thing and you just
fucked up that was the whole point of a
date making out at the end no you know
what I'm saying there's always date
number two but if you set it up might as
well kick it if you're already here last
rep might as well kick it don't go out
there making out with people without
their consent God damn it get out of
here don't sink come on big chest man
more
chest up
that way just that way no shaking finish

notice they're working hard this isn't
normal normal week of training not Peak
weekly for them this is real rir
