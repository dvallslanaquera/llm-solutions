hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
spiritization question do you listen to
reggae if so it is objectively terrible
music
i'm kidding of course reggie is the best
there's
bob marley
um
and all sorts of other folks
in any case
now that we got that out of the way
hormones matter a ton
excuse me
for weight loss
turns out that's not true
what but i thought the hormones they
mattered well let's take a look
lots of people
say that hormones are super important to
weight loss
and a lot of times they'll say that
people that are very over fat or very
very skinny are thus
because of hormone differences
interesting
and
that if those people addressed those
hormone differences
they wouldn't have to cut calories or
increase calories
to lose or gain a lot of weight and they
would renorm and be super healthy and in
super great shape just because they
adjusted the hormones now that's
sometimes true
but it's true very rarely compared to
the number of times it is not true and
if there's another culprit for why
especially
over fat people are over fat
next time you hear someone say we'll get
to the culprit in just a bit
it's junk food by the way the answer is
junk food
next time you hear someone say
that hormones are super important for
let's say
why is that person really fat well it's
hormones
which ones ask them you'll probably get
a blank stare because they probably have
no fucking idea
sometimes they will list hormones and
the thing is actual obesity researchers
don't really consider these hormones
very important for weight management for
example testosterone
doesn't really have any very
repeatable predictable effects on body
weight some people gain weight from
testosterone some people lose weight for
more testosterone can't really tell
estrogen also no clue growth hormone
very complex effects that don't directly
map onto body weight burns fat really
well also helps you gain muscle the fuck
knows what it does for total body weight
insulin and glucagon believe it or not
insulin does not automatically make you
gain weight and as a matter of fact
insulin secretion
in your body
increases your satiety it doesn't
decrease it
and it's often counterbalanced by
glucagon making the satiety thing
actually a non-starter unless you're
injecting lots of insulin then you have
to eat lots of food just to keep
yourself upright so your own insulin
dynamics probably have no major effect
as a matter of fact if you happen to be
quite insulin resistant insulin doesn't
even have the same effect on target
tissues that it usually does it can't
make you as fat as it's supposed to
because your fat cells are largely
resistant to its effects
so
how the hell is it still making you
really fat it's not it's not the insulin
the insulin carbohydrate model of
obesity
model not theory not an interconnected
framework of well-supported uh
evidentiary facts
model but someone thought well this is
the way it works it's been rejected
since probably the late 90s in any
serious consideration
these all these hormones make really
small differences in how much total
weight you gain or lose however they
make really large differences in
composition of the weight in muscle mass
versus fat mass all these hormones make
big big differences
but as far as weight loss they don't if
you see someone who's really over fat
like my 600 pound life type of person
the gay man is clearly hormones is it
really it's not clear to most obesity
researchers that that's the case now
you may think there's one exception
thyroid hormone low thyroid levels can
predispose people to a higher level of
adiposity to carrying more body fat
however the absolutely vast majority of
people that are over fat that are very
very overweight in an unhealthy way do
not have thyroid problems thyroid
problems explain the minority of over
fatness and in addition to this
low activity of the thyroid low
production thyroid hormones explains
some of the variance in weight yes
you'll be a little bit heavier with low
thyroid production but not double the
size you're supposed to be that shit is
really hard to pull off so thyroid
hormone is absolutely the best candidate
hormone to explain overall weight but it
doesn't do that good of a job that it is
the dominant way to explain that so the
title of this video is hormones matter a
ton for weight loss and that's bullshit
it don't matter a ton thyroid doesn't
matter a ton it matters quite a bit
in few cases very few cases it's not
something you can generalize to almost
everyone now if you ask the question
okay so are hormones important for
weight loss and weight gain no
shit so what is well
a high consumption of ultra tasty
hyperpalatable food mostly in the
category of junk food drives calories
into a surplus for people over days and
weeks and months and years and they get
much fatter hormones up hormones down
doesn't matter you tons of junk food you
get into caloric surplus you will gain
fat in almost every case
your hormonal status
is not
really pertinent to that in almost any
meaningful extent
now
bodybuilders take loads of hormones the
non-drug tested ones of course
but what do they do to get their leanest
they don't just take hormones okay when
people see a super lean bodybuilder when
you go into reddit forums they're like
trent var clan just drugs they've heard
of but never actually used almost anyone
who gives you random drug names never
used drugs before and it turns out that
yes they take all those drugs and that
has absolutely a very big effect on what
they look like but the biggest effect is
diet you know it sounds crazy but try
this at home
start at like 20 fat or 15 fat
and take all the drugs you can to see if
just with drugs alone don't fucking
touch your diet don't touch it at all
just with drugs can you get into contest
shape if that was the case a lot of
bodybuilders would do it because taking
drugs is a whole lot easier than dieting
but it almost never happens because diet
generating a hypocaloric condition
taking your calories at maintenance and
reducing them while of course taking a
ton of hormones
gets you super super lean keeps all of
your muscle and does all these wonderful
things at a vast expense to your health
and sanity of course
but wouldn't it be great if you could
alter your hormone levels so profoundly
as claimed by some nutritional advocates
that if you like ate carnivore you could
just get contest lean never have to cut
your calories you would never ever be
hungry again you'd have tons of energy
because carnivore is the way to go all
you did was switch to fucking carnivore
from eating a normal diet and boom
shredded gluten strations everything
oh wait get the fuck up out of here
that's bullshit doesn't work
while i'm on the subject carnivore sucks
i'm gonna get a lot of heat for this one
all right sup liver king
anyway i'll see you guys next time
you
