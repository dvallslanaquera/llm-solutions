hey folks
dr michael israel here for renaissance
prediction rp
plus and rp university lecture number
three
fat loss nutrition
timing food comp and supplements for fat
loss
a lot of subjects but luckily all of
these remember on the diet priority
pyramid take up not so much space
um altogether they take up a total of 20
so you know it makes sense that calories
and macros we spent quite a bit of time
on a little bit of a shorter lecture but
nonetheless some really good nuances to
get through so today we're going to be
talking about nutrient timing basics for
fat loss
then for composition we'll be tackling
proteins carbs fats
we'll talk about fat loss supplements
and a little bit on hydration for
fat loss and uh turns out that's not
that
big of a deal all right so let's get
right into it
nutrient timing basics for fat loss
because fat loss occurs
on basically a daily caloric deficit a
lot of nutrient timing doesn't have so
much to do with fat loss as it has to do
with
muscle mass preservation so if our
fractional breakdown rate
fbr the rate at which muscle is lost or
broken down
is elevated this is a bad thing it's
something we don't want to happen
much at all right and
potentially when we elevate fractional
synthetic rate for muscle post workout
for a couple of days to the extent that
it's elevated
it should be supplied by amino acids
because that's
taken opportunities to grow that muscle
so if anything we put on muscle during
our fat loss phase but at the very least
we can grow some muscle so that when we
lose it at various other points in the
fat loss diet
there's a balance there and we end up
not losing any net muscle
so two concerns we want to keep
breakdown of muscle as little as
possible
we want to supply muscle growth as much
and at every opportunity as we can
so that we can balance out the growth
with losses and end up at
least uh you know sort of neutral in
that
the thing is anything less than about
four meals per day
uh three meals for sure definitely two
absolutely one
is going to lead to a lack of coverage
for fbr
which means that when we have uh
opportunities for muscle breakdown to
occur there are neither the
carbohydrates nor the amino acids to
prevent that from occurring
right so if you eat very infrequently
you're full for a while which is really
good
uh and then you're actually empty for a
while too and when you're really running
an empty and you don't have amino acids
coming in from the gi tract
uh if you were prone to losing muscle at
that time which on a hypocaloric diet
you sort of kind of always are
then if you don't have that
counterbalance of amino acids in the
bloodstream or at least carbs
uh real bad deal and you end up losing
some muscle it's not a ton but it
definitely adds up over the long term
uh let's just say okay so the more meals
we can have the better well anything
above seven meals probably backs into
its own digestion
we would you know eat a chicken breast
uh with some other food and that's three
to four hours of amino acids in the
bloodstream no problem
so if you're eating like you know 10
times a day it's kind of like
you know there's tons of overlap
occurring so probably seven meals or
something like that
is a top end uh to make sure that we're
getting uh more or less
amino acid exposure almost all the time
and
thus four to seven meals per day is a
recommended intake
uh you know can we get super technical
and drive a really hard bargain or what
are the cost and benefits between four
and seven yeah sure
uh inside the scope of this particular
course
uh four to seven is just fine a seven is
probably for folks to train multiple
times a day or
exotic needs or preparing for shows and
then four is probably for folks just
interested in general fat loss
um maybe a little bit activity maybe
train once a day so on and so forth
and all right so we got the meal number
down but how are those meals clustered i
mean you can have four meals
every meal two hours apart for just like
yeah just like six hours a day or eight
hours a day
and and then what do you do like you're
just done eating or something like that
well it's uh
that's an interesting way to do it but
probably because we want to
keep fractional breakdown rates sort of
attended to at all times
the anti-catabolism function of protein
we want a rough even spread of meals
right we want most the meals to occur at
an even spread
so that we are covering as much of the
day as possible with meals
um so that you know because protein is
so critical to per uh you know
fulfilling fractional synthetic rates
when the opportunity occurs
and into muting fractional breakdown
rates along with carbs of course
what a roughly even spread of protein
throughout each meal so basically if you
have 200 grams of protein
that you want to take in and you're
taking in four meals a day you should
probably have around
around 50 grams of protein at each meal
and make sure the meals occur like oh i
don't know like
five hours apart or something like that
uh four or five hours and then that way
you get most of the day covered
and there's never really a time when
you're super low on amino acids except
for maybe towards the tail end of when
you sleep
and and that's about it so a pretty good
start there what about carbs
so carbs are really important
pre-workout
especially on a fat loss phase because
on a fat loss phase you generally have
pretty low blood glucose which is good
because that means your
fats have to be essentially pushed into
your bloodstream to
attend to the low blood glucose not
feeding all the rest of your body
awesome burns fat but it doesn't exactly
leave you with a ton of workout energy
so if you have a time to eat carbs
at any time of the day uh pre-workout is
a real good time to eat your carbs
because it probably maximizes how much
effort you can put in your workout
stimulus
anabolism and anti-metabolism and all
that other good stuff
so for your weight training workouts and
sport specific workouts when you're
losing fat
pre-workout carbs are really really
really important if you have 100 grams
of carbs to spare
maybe like 30 to 50 of them should just
go right into the pre-workout meal real
good idea
during the workout if you have long
workouts in a performance oriented like
let's say you train crossfit
competitively for two hours a day
having intro workout is really really
good on a fat loss diet because it means
when you are normally fatiguing and
you'd
really be extra fatiguing if it was a
fat loss diet you have those
carbohydrates to really boost you as a
matter of fact
intra and uh workout and pre-workout
carbohydrates are even included in a lot
of ketogenic diets
um where it's like targeted ketogenic
diet where during the training you're
not actually in ketosis you get all the
benefits of carbs then
and then you're in ketosis the rest of
the time so it's that powerful that even
people who are very very convinced that
keto is a really good idea not big fans
of carbs even they use carbs for some of
these purposes
now if you are doing workouts that
aren't
so so crazy there aren't they're not
longer than an hour
and you know hunger is a real factor for
you like you don't want to be any hungry
on your diet
then you probably don't want to take
carbs and put them into your workout or
as many of them
why is any amount of carb you put in via
just shake or powder
in your workout i mean those carbs like
you're not hungry during your workout
anyway because you're working so hard
and you know they're not exactly filling
carbs anyway so they're kind of just i
don't want to say wasted carbs that
definitely get
used for workout but boy they just don't
have a real anti-hunger effect like it's
not when you need
anti-hunger and it's the worst kind of
anti-hunger as a gatorade geez barely
fills you at all so
instead of doing 35 grams of gatorade
during your workout
if you're experiencing hunger take that
35 grams of carbs and throw it in
fresh fruit or veggies for your meal
post-workout or the meal after gee
that's a huge anti-hunger hit and the
macros are the same calories are the
same so you get the same results as far
as weight loss
probably or similar fat loss results but
you'll have like double or triple the
anti-hunger effect for that meal
so if hunger is a big factor i would say
the intra-workout carbs are some of the
first things to get cut if carbs are
getting cut
post-workout carbs really good idea more
of those go to glycogen than otherwise
would and less go to fat there's some
good recent research to back that up
so you know if you're going to eat carbs
at any part of your day and you want to
reload glycogen which is excellent for a
bunch of things
and you want to blast the fat because
you're trying to burn fat
eating them pre maybe during like we
talked about just now and
post-workout and several meals is
probably a good idea keeping
carbohydrates either
to trace levels or lower in other meals
way before your workout or way after
is probably best practice now typically
you would keep your fats low around the
workout window because it prevents
digestive difficulties and prevents the
carbohydrates from getting to where they
need to be
asap the thing is like uh for super high
calories that's definitely a concern
when you're eating low calories
especially low enough it's not much of a
concern
first of all you don't have that many
fats to eat and second of all
you know even if you have some fats it's
just not enough to really make a huge
difference and make you sick
um that being said you know if you have
uh 20 grams of fat to move around
through the day somewhere
where all of it's embedded with other
protein and trace carb sources
um i probably wouldn't eat it before the
workout it offers no energy advantages
just delay stuff could make you even a
little sick even on a fat loss phase
but a sort of best case scenario is just
kind of pissed away it's wasted
remember you're not hungry during your
workout anyway
saving fat for later in the evening or
earlier in the morning
when you can have a nice big meal plenty
of protein plenty fat
real anti-hunger kind of meal especially
before
uh you know is your one of your later
meals of the day it can help you relax
in the evening and help you go to sleep
probably best to save your fats for that
and not just jam them into the workout
window
on that note of helping you sleep the
nighttime meal or whatever meal you eat
last before you go to sleep
should probably be pretty high in
protein maybe even a little higher than
the other meals
because we want to dope out the protein
as you sleep to prevent muscle loss from
occurring
and it should probably be slower
digesting so something like cottage
cheese if anyone eats that shit anyway
it looks like it's kind of cheese
it's awful awful i used to eat cottage
cheese in high school trying to get
jacked it worked but a terrible price to
my sanity
greek yogurt which is sweet um the
greeks definitely are better people than
the cottage people
where the fuck that cheese comes from
and um
basically that stuff like that casein is
an excellent or just right to the source
slow digesting protein
really good idea and if you want to eat
like just regular proteins with a little
more fat to slow digest them that's
totally fine
all right moving right along that's
nutrient timing so that's it basically
four to seven meals per day
spread your protein sources evenly have
your clubs carbs clustered around
especially pre-workout maybe during
some good deal of them after less
everywhere else and then
get your uh fats just spread out away
from the workout
um if you're really struggling with
hunger
you can move some of your carbs towards
and and probably all your fats too or
most of them
into later in the evening and what that
ends up doing is
keeping you nice and full in the evening
where most people struggle struggle with
hunger now if you're mostly hungry in
the morning move more of your carbs to
the morning
there's definitely an individual thing i
will say this and we'll get to this
down a little bit sleep has so far been
implicated in having an
unbelievably important role in
uh the fat burning and muscle retention
process if you're not getting enough
sleep or good sleep
you'd be pissing away pounds of muscle
over the months and not even knowing it
like you might even feel like
pretty okay but even a little bit of
sleep loss or sleep quality loss is a
bad deal
so where are we going with this if
having more food in the evening helps
you sleep
right and because you sometimes have
trouble sleeping if you're hungry
are you waking up stuff like that gee
that's a bad deal so if more food
helps you sleep forget a lot of that
stuff or just modify it
to bias the food a little bit more
specifically the carbs and fats
too closer to bedtime when you get to
bedtime you'll be nice and full
and you'll go to bed you'll have a great
night's sleep you'll wake up you're
going to be running a gun
and you know living a lean life early in
the morning
all right but then another good benefit
is psychologically you can always
look forward to the fact that you know
the toughest part of your day is the
morning which a lot of people are hungry
anyway but
you know once you get through the
morning get your workouts in blah blah
blah
and the as the day goes on you get more
and more food which is psychologically
way easier i'll put you this way it's
not for everyone just an idea
if we use the opposite paradigm yeah
that's kind of tough like if you eat
most of your food in the morning
and then progressively starve more and
more as night comes up
gee that's tough just psychologically
thinking like as you're eating your
morning food we're like better enjoy
this now
because it's all going away in a couple
of hours like that's really tough to
deal with
whereas front loading the hard stuff
tends to work better for
more people it doesn't mean that it's
going to work better for you something
to give some thought
so on to protein composition here's the
deal higher quality proteins are simply
better
for everything we need proteins to be as
far as uh supplying muscle growth
and preventing muscle loss and so on and
so forth so that means dairy
which includes whey egg proteins are
superior
meats are great they're right up there
uh complete of vegan sources like soy
satan microprotein or
corn as it's also called uh they're good
not quite as good as meats but pretty
comparable
then you get complementary proteins uh
like
uh you know i guess quinoa is complete
but complementary proteins is like uh
you know beans and rice and stuff like
that
uh they're decent quinoa is pretty good
but this bioavailability is not all that
great
so it's not it's not the most amazing
protein sources in the world but
you can get by with some of them
incomplete plant proteins are very mess
so you might have noticed that
um uh you know your whole grain bread
can have like five grams of protein in
it you're like sure
that's a lot of protein i would probably
count only half of that at most
because it has such a hard time
digesting
such a poor amino acid profile that it
doesn't spare muscle loss
it does that okay it definitely doesn't
cause muscle growth nearly to the extent
that you would expect for five grams
of whey protein or five grams of beef
protein or something like that
so definitely um uh if you're
you know into the vegan lifestyle which
is totally cool then
uh you know making sure you get the
higher quality proteins preferentially
is probably a good idea
now got a couple of other tips here for
vegans or people just trying to eat less
animal products
first is you want to try to eat maybe
not a gram per pound
but more like a gram and a half per
pound of protein per day now this is a
big conundrum right especially for very
serious vegan athletes of which there's
a growing number
one and a half grams of protein from
vegan sources
is just hard right like there's good
supplements there's good food but you
got to be pretty regimented like
if you're a meat eater that's just open
and close your eyes and boom one and a
half
grams per pound is gone but if you are
not a meat eater
and and if you don't even need any
animal products at all it's tough it's
possible right through a combination of
sources but it's going to have to
require some work and some people say
do i really need that much on a fat loss
phase you will benefit from it
absolutely and
the thing is uh the huge moral benefits
of veganism
you know they're not free right so if
you're really serious about uh reducing
or stopping animal suffering you're
gonna have to eat a gram and a half
uh per pound per day of you know a
seitan or microprotein or
something like that and it's not going
to be amazing it's a lot of it's
tough to digest but it's got to be worth
it if your athletic performance is
number one to you
and a really good way to do that is to
supplement with a high quality powder
protein of which there are many for
vegans
and you know supplements are really easy
just with one or two meals
of the day you put an extra scoop of
vegan protein which can be flavored like
anything you want and all of a sudden
it's just not that hard to get nearly as
much protein in so
an interesting way to do it is if you've
been eating a gram per pound and you're
a vegan or vegetarian
and you're like crap i need to go up to
a gram and a half when i'm cutting to
make sure that i don't uh
lose too much muscle you just buy a
protein supplement and have it with like
two meals
25 grams each time or something like
that boom you're golden there there's
your 1.5
rems per pound per day lastly you really
do want to change
your diet or alter your diet to have
more complete high quality vegan
proteins
things like again soy satan mycoprotein
quinoa
and less like counting up your protein
from broccoli and bread and pasta okay
that stuff counts but it counts into the
1.5
uh it doesn't count as much as as you
would hope it would because it isn't
fully digested it's not ideal for
absorption
and transformation into muscle so just
you gotta stay on top of stuff if you're
vegan vegetarian it's hard work
next up carb composition for fat loss
this one's actually super easy
veggies fruits and whole grains are by
far the best for health
and really good news is they're
incredibly filling
in that order actually and unbelievably
great for
keeping hunger at bay veggies are the
most filling thing you can eat
period of all foods fruits are a close
second fresh fruits
and whole grains are up there probably
comparable to protein
so you know if you eat like a lot of
like regular grains that are not or
processed grains
white bread things like that uh you know
like you're going to eat carbs and
they're just kind of going to vanish
i'm still hungry right but if you eat
most of your carbs from veggies fruits
and whole grains in that order
gee you can be real full deep into a
caloric deficit
lose fat without really suffering a
whole lot
right so really when you start a fat
loss diet or as you go through a fat
loss diet consider reducing processed
carbs
various low fiber carbs and more and
more as the diet goes on
you want to eat more veggies more fruits
more whole grains
and less of the processed carbs and so
on and so forth so stay away from the
rice cakes as much
and choose broccoli spinach kale etc
strawberries oranges apples things like
that
maybe brown rice whole wheat pasta and
that'll keep you way less hungry than
normal if you ate you know other foods
as well
uh as far as your shakes yeah they're
still supposed to be fast adjusting
because they're on the workout
but probably fewer shakes and more whole
foods as hunger wears out a lot of
professional bodybuilders will take
shakes out of their diet
just eat mostly whole food as they prep
for shows why mostly because of hunger
right because if you just
take a shake and you down it you're like
oh that was good
i could just eat as much food as
possible remember liquids not that
filling
and then all of a sudden you're like oh
geez that's 250 calories i could have
eaten in solid food and actually had an
anti-hunger effect
fat composition for fat loss real big
first point here is that remember your
essential fats are important now when
you're eating a eu caloric iso-caloric
diet especially when you're eating a
hyper-caloric diet
and you're getting enough calories it's
really super easy to get all the
essential fats you need just through
trace sources
but if you're on a fat loss diet
especially an extended one that lasts
you know more than eight weeks and if
you're
really doing multiple fat loss diets in
a row with relatively short maintenance
breaks
it's probably a good idea to get in some
essential fatty acids
especially omega-3s because we don't
seem to get enough of those in our diet
usually
so uh maybe an epa dha supplement is a
good idea
maybe eating uh some fish uh maybe twice
a week is a good idea and rotating the
different kinds of fish
you take in that's probably a good thing
just keep you plugging along and get
keep all those benefits going
um the good thing is you'll probably get
enough saturated fats just through
animal products if you if you're an
omnivore
if you're gonna eat extra fats and look
like if you have 70 grams of fat to eat
per day you're 200 pounds that's a
totally reasonable amount even on a
deficit
you might not get all those through epa
dha supplements and through
meats because you know your meats might
be super lean at that point
so you may want to eat fats on top of
that and then
monounsaturated sources are probably the
best because every time they're tested
they have
unbelievable health benefits they
actually lead to fat loss and stuff like
that it's really great
uh anti-inflammatory effects so on and
so forth so nut but
nuts nut butters olive oils canola oils
avocados so on and so forth but
big hint and this should be covered in
macros but it's worth repeating
watch the amounts and on the food
palatability scale of how enticing
something is and how much more of it you
want to eat like you know the potato
chip
can't have just one effect you've got to
really watch out for the nut butters
right that's a little pro tip or
whatever they say you know
almond butter peanut butter even the
especially the natural ones are
so delicious that if you start using
them on your fat loss diet it's just
going to make you crave
more and there's something to be said
and we're not going to cover this
because this is just a technical
nutrition lecture it's not
covering adherence or anything like that
we've got other lectures for that
a big adherence tip is to not keep junk
food in the home
because if you have junk food in the
home you're more likely to eat it during
times of weakness so to say
if you have peanut butter in the home
like crunchy natural peanut butter
boy oh boy it's not safe and also
if you try to do the measuring scoop
system for peanut butter a lot of times
just a little bit of an error is
way more nut butter way more calories
and you could be off by a considerable
amount
as a matter of fact early on in the
renaissance
periodization company history when we
were coaching a lot of people on the the
first
diet templates were out we had to have
like multiple posts on social media
about
this is what an actual scoop of peanut
butter looks like when it's a tablespoon
it's not this right and it was just off
by a little but one was
double the calories or the other and a
lot of people found that very
enlightening and a lot of people were
like oh my god
no wonder i haven't been losing weight
so an interesting
fat loss tip is tell someone to replace
all their nut butters with regular nuts
or oils and they just start losing
weight and they're like ah i guess the
nut butters were inflaming me like nope
you were just overeating them and you
had no idea
so a big tip there and uh you know
those monosaturated fats are good but
you probably won't have an opportunity
to eat a ton of them but if you do
they're a good place to get your fats
all right
fat loss supplements
not the longest list in the world
because most supplements don't work
whey protein just like in a muscle gain
lecture whey protein works for your
workout shake i wouldn't use it too much
outside of a workout shake
because whey protein tends to be very
quickly digesting
and it's good has good anti-hunger
properties while you eat it
but or you know while it's digesting but
it just doesn't digest for very long so
sooner or later you're left
pretty empty and uh another effective
supplement is creatine you know two and
a half grams per 100 pounds per day so
if you weigh 200 pounds
that's 5 grams per day timing of
creatine is not important
because it loads in your cells over
about a week and then you can just take
it any time of the day and it loads just
the same way it keeps your cells topped
off
so creatine is good creatine spares
muscle
and it improves performance so on a
variety of fronts it's really really
good for fat loss phases
a real good tip for creatine is to
introduce it the week before you start a
fat loss phase
so that you get your water weight gain
and then when you start measuring your
weight
you can know that the creatine is
already loaded and all the losses are
going to be good
a lot of people start creatine when
their fat loss phase starts
and they're going to be like we talked
about in the last lecture they're going
to be using
their weight in order to figure out you
know how much
do i change my macros like if the body
weight's falling down then it's good or
if it's not it's not
creatine makes you gain you know
anywhere from gee
one to ten pounds potentially over the
course of a week of just intramuscular
body water
so imagine being just a five pound
creatine gainer
starting creatine you know the first you
lose an actual two pounds that's a very
impressive loss
of tissue in your first week but uh you
start creatine so you gain
a net total of three pounds what are you
supposed to do with your macros
let's say it's two weeks later and
you're just around the same weight
that you started like you've technically
gained a pound
what are you gonna do cut your macros
like crazy maybe they're already pretty
low if you're losing two pounds of
tissue a week
that's just going to be a huge mistake
so start your creatine the week before
you'll you'll reach a higher body weight
but then everything from there as you
cut will be much more reflective of
actual tissue
losses versus body water shifts that
creatine causes
number three casein protein really good
meal replacement at night or for when
you're on the go
slow digesting so it has a really big
effect on preventing fractional
breakdown rates from getting too high
it's like it's almost like having an iv
of protein or something like that
really really good thing of course
glycemic workout carbs intro and
post-workout especially intra-workout
um not super important on a fat loss
phase
but again if you're doing sport training
or really really highly active
training is very important to you and
it's a long training it's very hard
those intra-workout glycemic carbs can
be uh somewhat effective
multivitamin in a balanced diet that's
isocaloric or hypercaloric multivitamins
are not actually super important
because you know if you eat a variety of
foods you probably get all your vitamins
and minerals just fine
multivitamins can really help on a fat
loss diet because you just
might not be getting enough uh food
and you you're never gonna not never
you're very unlikely to get around
actual shortage or
deficiency of vitamins and minerals but
you could get into kind of kind of a
mini one
that could affect a couple of things and
just make your process not as great as
it could have been it's a good insurance
policy is a multivitamin every day and
they're almost
free so that's not a big deal number six
okay and it's way higher than sixth
rank and its impact this isn't ranked
list uh stimulants okay
stimulants have a variety particularly
caffeine is the quintessential stimulant
um stimulants do a couple of really
great things specifically for fat loss
phases one
they have a really big anti-hunger
effect all right so
if you have a certain amount of
stimulant your hunger goes down almost
for everyone there's some small
exceptions
stimulants can give you the ability to
focus on work uh which is really good
because you know a lot of times when
you're on a fat loss diet you know we
all have day jobs right
so if you're on a fat loss diet and the
reason you stop adhering to it and cut
it short
is because you just can't be focused at
work because you don't have enough food
to power your brain
uh that's gonna interfere with the
results of the fat loss diet like you
might have wanted to lose
15 pounds over three months but you had
to stop with 10 pounds at two months
because your body was just like or your
brain was like i can't keep doing this
like you're
you know work you're underperforming and
you can't allow that to happen
if you've taken caffeine then your work
focus can improve and you can
consistently have good performance in
the rest of your life so that your diet
can keep going
and lastly workout energy workout energy
comes at a premium which is why we eat a
lot of pre-workout carbs on fat loss
phases
workout energy comes at a real premium
when we are talking
about fat loss phases especially towards
the end of fat loss phases getting in
tough workouts
can be a challenge that's a two part
problem one
if it's super challenging you may not
meet your criteria for training enough
to keep the muscle
on and two if you're really having
trouble working out
you might not be doing enough cardio
enough physical activity to keep moving
along and actually on that work
uh focus note caffeine and other
stimulants can keep your energy up
throughout the day
which means you're not exercise activity
thermogenesis you know you're burning
through
uh random daily activities is gonna be
considerably lower
it would be higher if you took in a
stimulant so stimulant can not only
have you have more energy during weight
training to save muscle loss during
cardio to burn fat
but also the rest of the day to keep fat
burning and calorie burning a good thing
so stimulants are a big deal we'll have
a couple of tips for them in just a sec
lastly epa dha subs right these are
omega-3 supplements
uh there's a question mark next to that
one because it's not really clear that
they have these huge advantages
might be something to throw in though
and experiment with because there's a
lot of potential there
hydration this entire presentation uh
has hydration just one line for it just
don't mess it up big time
regularly consume fluids make sure your
urine
is off yellow uh in color on
average and you're good to go right
hydration is not magic but if you
chronically under hydrate it's just
going to give you more problems more
headaches more of all this stuff
a hydration tip is before every meal in
which you're hungry
have like one or two glasses of water
and your stomach fills up temporarily
and then when you eat that meal you
actually get fuller faster
so that's a tip so if you're chronically
sort of chronic chronically a little bit
less hydrated than it could be
you might actually be getting hungrier
than normal so give that some thought
and of course your performance
you want to maximize during a fat loss
phase because it's tough
hydration could be a factor to maximize
your performance
at least as much as it'll take if you're
under calorie you can perform a certain
level
pretty well hydrated not the greatest
but you know pretty decent
if you're under calories which is a
given for fat loss phases and you're
dehydrated it means you're shooting
yourself in the foot so you might as
well take care of business there
all right lastly a few really important
tips on stimulant use and we'll talk
about stimulant cycling
later in the lecture on how to actually
change these variables as your body
adapts
through the fat loss phase if you're
using stimulants
chronically to keep you awake unless
you're a shift worker
or your crazy rotation through residency
as a doctor or something
that is not a good idea
if you're sleep deprived the sleep
deprivation is the issue
can stimulates keep you upright and
functioning while you sleep deprived yes
they do that incredibly well
the thing is you burn just as much
muscle and prevent just as much fat loss
which are two things sleep deprivation
does if you're on stimulants or if
you're off stimulants
so it's really in the literal sense of
the term from a body composition
perspective
masking the problem so people say look i
need my diet coke otherwise i'll fall
asleep or i need my coffee otherwise i'm
just
asleep in the middle of the day that's a
bad thing you should be able to stay
awake
without stimulants can you use them to
enhance your wakefulness and be a super
productive
you know uh cyborg totally but you
should still be a human being without
them right it's
some of you using stimulus that sounds
like crazy talk i promise it has
validity to it right
so if you're using stimulus to stay
awake
you need to fix your sleep period
but if your sleep is decent that's fine
you can use a stimulants on top of that
when you start using stimulants or
whatever amount of stimulants you're
using at the beginning of your fat loss
phase
you can work up as needed as the fat
loss phase goes on
what does that mean if you use
pre-workout
maybe don't use the whole two scoops of
ronnie coleman's 550 mg of caffeine
pre-workout
at the beginning of a fat loss phase
because then what are you going to do at
the end of a fat loss phase when energy
is even lower g mean you might not be
doing anything at all
red you can't take like 1200 milligrams
of caffeine at the same time you're
going to end up at the hospital
so there's no room to grow maybe start
off with like a diet mountain dew
before a workout uh 30 minutes before
workout 15 minutes before
and uh at the beginning of your uh you
know pre-workout at the beginning of
your diet
and then later move up to like you know
like a mountain dew code red diet or
something
more caffeine and then later go to half
a scoop of ronnie coleman's
signature series uh supplements and then
after go to a full scoop or something so
you ramp up the caffeine and that for
the rest of your life as well maybe you
have
a cup of coffee per day or a cup of tea
when you start your day
every day normally when you start your
fat loss diet maybe bump that up to a
cup and a half
right and then eventually to two cups
and then eventually to three cups or
four cups a day at the very end of your
diet
and then taper back off so you know if
you start full bore with as much
caffeine as your body can handle the
beginning of a diet
there's just no flex there for when the
diet gets tougher yeah you got a good
effect the entire time but
ideally you want to dose your effect as
the diet goes on you want to dose it
accordingly
and um last tip here
watch your stimulant timing um because
if your sleep is affected by stimulants
that's a bad deal remember they keep you
awake
so if you have a workout at 5 pm
you might want to take enough stimulus
to get you through the workout but not
so much stimulant that you're like
buzzing about at 12 a.m and you watched
all of youtube already
because that's going to interfere with
sleep and have all these other bad
consequences
i will see that one of the more
difficult problems is for people who get
off work late or for whatever reason
their schedule
is such that they can only train at like
8 or 9 p.m they come home they have one
meal they relax and they go to sleep
stimulant use should be minimal in those
individuals
or basically as much stimulant as you
can handle
without having sleep problems so it's
just
it shouldn't be a rocket science problem
to you where you're like all right i
took 600 milligrams of caffeine at 8 pm
i did my workout and it's 3am and i'm
not falling asleep i wonder why
it's the stimulants so make sure you
have just the amount of stimulants you
need
that little golden zone between get
yourself a good workout
good enough and not so many
that you stay awake at night and
honestly if you train really late at
night
consider switching workout potentially
switching a schedule
to train earlier that could be a solved
problem for you
i think that's it yep next time
we're gonna talk about how long you
should be losing fat for
uh and how much fat you can lose or how
much weight you can lose at any given
time to be safe and effective
and we're gonna talk about how to
measure progress folks
