i've been using the rp diet to fuel my
weightlifting performance for years and
rp's simple science-based approach has
been instrumental to my success
with the new rp diet app following rp's
principles is as easy as entering my
goals and schedule and choosing my
favorite foods
the app builds a diet to my exact needs
reminds me to eat my meals and adapts to
my body's changes every single day and
week
the rp diet app is a huge help in my
quest to become the best athlete i can
be and if your goal is to be your best
it will help you
folks welcome back i am slightly more
clean-cut
dr james hoffman he is equally as
clean-cut as last time i think
dr mike is retail we are here to answer
your questions on the youtubes
mike how's it going good how are you
okay dogs situations a little bit better
i've actually gotten some sleep
physically they're they they they grow
at like an alarming rate
like uh you know we got them when they
were like 10ish pounds and now they're
like 15 pounds you know what i mean
so it's like literally i put on half
your body weight in the matter of a few
weeks it's pretty sweet
actually one of them has a problem that
she uh the girl
grew asymmetrically her back legs just
fucking grew like
out of nowhere and her body didn't
really grow so now she's having like a
lot of joint laxity
in her like dog whatever the equivalent
of a dog knee is
when she walks like her knee will
displace in the wrong direction
because her back legs are too long and
so yeah we've been kind of dealing with
that but
they're good other than that there's a
dog there's a vest
yeah there's a dog lady in my
neighborhood like of all places
there's like a lady who babysits dogs
and houston montana so it's like it
worked out great so
we sent out dogs take care yeah so what
we've been doing is uh
folks if you ever have puppies this is a
brilliant way of managing your time
uh send them to do half days at doggie
daycare and then you can just work and
then come back and deal with the puppies
later because
when they're home all day it's just like
p p p p
p like never ending they just know and
they socialize well with other dogs
there so it's really good yeah
exactly so it's working out good and
they have a lot of fun
they do they have a ton um all right so
let's get started
yeah let's do it up do you want to share
you want me to share uh you can share
and i'll uh
i'll point okay
all right
let me know when you're ready ready to
go let's start with
cass j
[Music]
top comment next to milo i would prefer
it was kazz
b like bill kasmeier that's right he's
like hey how come you guys are small and
weak well we don't know
how come you guys don't use metrics
a very good question for all
so all right so casby
says hey mike i had a question that i've
been keeping a counter also
oh yeah fuck fuck fuck hold up hey
uh i can do i can ha i can do some
hashes
uh it's okay
what the fuck did i do my counter there
it is um
okay so i'm uh counters open all right
here we go
so hey mike i've had a question i have
wonderful while now i thought it might
be good
one for your next q a i've been watching
almost all lectures and trying to follow
a device but one subject so confuses me
so you told us in a lecture that you
have to get between zero and five rar to
grow well
some days you may be more fatigued so it
feels like one our ir might actually be
a
true three aria on that day so you'll
still grow it is what you said
which uh you mean not the other way
around
it feels like one rir but might actually
be a true like at the muscular level
that's a true three rar
um oh i see yeah
but then you also explained how you
train
where you go for a set of 18 one rir and
after that you drop down to 16
12 even 8 reps and 8 can feel like one
rir
at the time due to fatigue and possible
short rest
it's not due to short rest but it is due
to fatigue
but it's actually a true 11 rar
it's not and then you state as long as
it's about five reps it works
but isn't that way yours sorry yeah so
you're assuming within the question that
um that mike could reproduce that same
effort across
all sets given the same intensity
constrictions which fatigue prevents
that from happening
at all so yeah 100 percent
um uh let's see oh hey
true eleven alright he literally meant
11 reps from failure okay that makes
sense
um and then as you state as long as
about five reps it works
but isn't that a way of low stimul
stimulants
intensity for one set to even work and
doesn't this go against everything you
previously stated
okay so let me just address this really
quick and james already did it in part
um when we say you train
from zero to five rir and that's
generally a good range
we generally mean uh that we want the
local muscle itself
to generally be in that zero to five
hours so we don't want systemic factors
like systemic fatigue
to limit you so when you example is like
some days you feel more fatigued we're
assuming that systemic fatigue
and then yeah your r might be off a
little bit when you're going set to set
to set
you should be resting enough or by our
four-point checklist rest formula that
systemic fatigue is not a major factor
and in addition to that it also you
totally actually don't need this the
four-point checklist for this because
the limiting factor for fatigue from set
to set to set is often
just local okay so if you come in tired
limiting factor could be systemic
because
your muscles are fine it's just your
brain and the rest of your body is
tired but after you do a really hard set
usually limiting factor is pretty close
to at least the actual muscle itself and
then when you hit the muscle again
that is really a you know one rir
because the muscle itself is fucked up
and it really fatigued
so it is actually one rep away from
failure at the muscular level
which means it experiences all the
benefits of faster motor unit
recruitment
high levels of metabolites increased
pumps so on and so forth
and there is nothing anywhere ever in
the world that says you should be able
to match your performance set to set to
set that is literal make believe made up
by people for
just simplifying programs three by ten
there's no
reason to think that the amount of time
it takes you to recover to be able to do
ten reps again and again
is the optimum time for aperture for
your strength also there's no reason to
think you'll ever recover
so for example when i did a true zero r
r effort back in the day
at high bar squats i did 500 for ten
it's on youtube
um and my next set i think i did uh
like five or three at 500.
but i rested five minutes there's
actually no amount of time
short of a two-week re re-peaking
that i could have hit another 10 or 500.
so now that's not always
even even close even like seven or eight
like that no way
right like that's how much that set took
out of me so there's no reason to assume
that you can hit the same sets over and
over and over there's just no reason to
assume that
and as long as systemic factors aren't
the ones holding you back a ton
even if your muscle is fatigued locally
when you hit way fewer reps if you truly
push the muscle
close to local failure that rar estimate
is active
yeah and just like a fun thought
experiments where do you draw the line
as to what is a true
rir so mike already explained all we're
considering is the muscular level but
like
so if mike did a peaking protocol for
hack squats for example
and then did like a two week taper so
that he could have the best top set on
hack squat that he's ever done
ever would that be the true irr and then
reference everything else
before like there's a wasted message
cycle right exactly so it's kind of like
where do you draw the line and the
word that line is essentially where the
muscle is at the current time when
you're training and
the muscle not systemic factors the
muscle are the muscles truly being
pushed close to failure
i'm frozen
oh i'm frozen and
dr mike's in a really funny face right
now i wish people could see what i could
see
[Music]
can you hear me i can hear you there we
go oh sweet
um i they probably will see the face
because it gets recorded right to
youtube um
you know what i might try i'm kind of
struggling today i might just try
and i wonder if i can just turn off my
video
[Music]
actually you know what i'll mess with
that another time let's keep going
so okay let's get to the rest of this
question you also talked about junk
volume
as in when you get so tired that the
volume is above uh uh actual
6r and that is barely worth it should
you go you should better go home rest et
cetera
and don't force more sets which results
in direct volume but in that case isn't
most of your volume junk volume
it would be if a nervous system and
other
central systemic factors were limiting
but in that case they're not so it's all
for the four part question
uh cash j uh you should uh search on
youtube or in in the rp uh strength
channel or renthouse channel
um how long to rest between sets in like
hypertrophy made simple and it's it's
going to answer all these questions for
you
um and then he says i got all this from
your lectures
and training videos what you said seem
to contradict each other so can you
please explain to me because i don't
really see if you get it anymore
by the way i mostly do like four by
eight nine seven seven example of zero
error
set on my account with a weight i could
do eleven times for max
and then i go uh up the volume and
intensity our error goes down and lower
the reps etc per week for most compounds
uh sorry for a long question possibly
bad english it's not my main language
dyslexia haha
no worries i would advise you against
lowering the reps
uh week to week to week because it gives
you a troubling time estimating
the total effort you're exerting and you
trouble estimating whether or not you're
sufficiently recovered
so i would actually say to keep the reps
stable week to week to week and just
lower your ir
and if you can no longer keep the rep
stable to start to fall on you then
you're by definition underperforming
relative
last week and you should probably load
james anything to add to that um that
was good advice i'm just looking at what
he wrote the four by eight nine
seven seven so if that is a zero rir
there's some glaring issues for me the
first being that you probably aren't
doing a very good warm-up whenever you
see someone's
second set going up in reps usually that
means that the first set was still
effectively warming them up so i would
consider that
and uh also you might not be assessing
zero rar properly so
aside from the warm-up issue like
there's really no circumstance where you
do a set with the zero rer and your reps
go up in the subsequent set
uh it's realistically right and even
then
i would expect let's say you just flip
flopped the first two and did nine eight
seven seven i would expect it to be more
like
nine seven six five something like that
where
there's you really shouldn't be able to
hold on to your reps that hard when
you're going at zero maybe if you're
going one or two
that seems more normal but at zero no
way
and let's go on to question number two
which is going to be
from right below eruption
89. almost sounds sexual
right yeah yes just uh two two
uh integers in that first number away
from hot
69 eruption why do you suggest that
intermediates
should mainly use the five to ten rep
range and only 24
to 40 in the 10 to 20 range with
presumably none of 20 30 is it because
maximizing faster
fiber growth i understand that beginners
need to master good technique and don't
get fatigued enough to need the high
lighter rep ranges is there a problem
with their media's using more exercise
in the 10 20 20 30 rep ranges
uh russia i believe that uh i've uh
james and i have always said that
beginners should be in a five to ten
range
primarily and that intermediates should
be primarily in the ten to twenty
actually i don't believe
we ever said yeah i was wondering about
that too yeah i was like i don't think
we've ever said that
yeah simple simple answer on that one so
we're gonna count that as done
uh it's good that we get to say stuff
like this though like do these webinars
and answer that because it's always good
to
you know get get out of the
misconception and let's face it you and
i say dumb shit all the time so it's not
outside of the realm of possibility for
sure
say some shit i need to be clarified
here's what we really meant
all right let's go next right below to
frank hutec
who says hello macho men is actively
elevating the scapulas
extrapolate don't you even latin
oh boy this is going to be one of those
like paralysis analysis questions i feel
like coming on
well right quick side note crystal and i
started watching the simpsons
uh on hulu and comic book guy was like
in the first episode and i just started
dying of laughter
dude i love comic book guys he's the
greatest character and i swear to god
he's my favorite character and any
anything ever comic book guy there uh
for
for you listeners when mike and i were
in johnson city we went to an airsoft
store
just outside of johnson city and that
guy literally
exists in the real world in the real
world he's bigger in the real world
he was really big oh man that was funny
hello macho men is actively engaging the
scapulae
aka shrugging at lockout and overhead
press necessary at least preferable to
avoid impingement
i remember mark rubio saying this in a
video and this is how i learned to press
do you i have to do this it does make
the work a bit harder having to shrug
hundreds of thousands of pounds overhead
some
[Music]
risk that's usually unlikely pressing
overhead is an
impingement risk hugging
uh decrease that decrease
somewhat by a mechanism i'm not aware of
at any point
but it is does absolutely fuck up the
stimulus and fatigue ratio of your
overhead press and i'll tell you that
precisely
uh zero olympic weight lifters do it i
mean i don't know about zero but less
than one percent
uh they just press and so pretty much
all strong men press and there's not
like a
spate of injuries there from impingement
so they get just
five you know five two boxes for for
shit rippito says
box one is like fucking really spot on
shit that's brilliantly put on super
simple
and box two is like insane shit that he
just makes up uh
that goes in the box too as far as i'm
concerned james yeah and
i i'm sorry mike if i repeat anything
that you said i kind of got robotted out
there for a little while
but i don't know if there's any actual
you know tangible safety
mechanism built into that and part two
um you do naturally do that a little bit
if you've ever actually done a lot of
overhead pressing it's not uncommon for
people
to have sore delts and traps and that's
just a result of you naturally elevating
your step deals a little bit during the
press what i don't think you should do
is spend a lot of time
actively trying to like shrug up as
you're pressing that just seems like a
ton of wasted effort and i caught mike
saying at the end
uh definitely going to screw up your
stimulus to fatigue ratio on that
movement and i totally agree with that
it just seems silly because you're
already going to do that a little bit as
a natural part of the movement so no
need to accentuate the shrugging part
yeah all right so
um let's move down a couple
notches to the blue letter b bastion
hi docs thank you a lot for this format
question for you what's the best way to
increase vertical jump height for a
professional volleyball player whose
jumping technique is already perfect
who is generally well trained and losing
weight is not an option
jump height is the sole focus volleyball
training only once a week volleyball
training once a week is already a bad
idea we decided here earlier
time for improvement three months so how
would a program look like for the next
three months when the goal is only to
increase vertical jump height which
exercises volume intensities frequencies
periodization etc looking forward to
hearing from you
we're absolutely not going to answer
this question the level of depth that
you would like
because that writing a program out with
words over youtube
is a little bit out of the scope of what
you can do with human language
um it should be written but james can
you give us the broad strokes please to
send bastian on his way with something
new
yeah sure so this is kind of a tough one
because you're asking like in a very
acute sense and
unfortunately um fortunately
unfortunately jumping is something that
can benefit from like short-term
periodization strategies but probably
has the best benefit in the long term
so what i would say is generally you're
going to take a long-term approach
for something like jumping and the way
that you would do that is by as you
already mentioned
learning how to jump properly but
strength is generally the best bang for
your buck in terms of the moderate
to long-term jump improvements why
because for the most part
most athletes are not limited by the
power that they produce they literally
just don't produce enough force
to get as much out of the jump or any
kind of power related movement that
they're doing
so usually what we find is that you can
take an athlete like a volleyball player
for example and if they're an
intermediate level
i know this person is already a
professional but just just hear me out
um you can take it in two intermediate
athletes
you give one that's just like a more
strength focused program one that's a
more power focused program
and by the end of you know three to five
months they're going to get roughly the
same
type of games and what we find is that
strength is
usually the learning factor for most
kind of intermediate level people in the
long term
in the short term you can actually see
some pretty rapid improvements in
jumping ability by doing a lot of jump
and power specific training however this
is one of those things that tends to
plateau
extremely fast so you can kind of eke
out like a really big
power benefit from doing some highly
specific jump training
but that's one of those things where
you're going to see it just after like
one or two
mesos kind of really peak out so that
being said you got
three months that's a pretty good amount
of time to work i would hope you know if
you if
in a better situation i would like to
see that stretched out like okay we're
trying to work on jump height for the
next six months to a year that would be
something very very tangible very very
workable three months is kind of like
okay we're just gonna do the best that
we can
first off it depends on what you're
trying to do with the jump if it's
volleyball specific training like
volleyball specific jumping
i would actually just increase your
volleyball uh training at that point
that would make the most sense first off
right off the bat
if it's an actual test like you're doing
a jump height test one of the easiest
ways to do it is actually just to start
rehearsing the conditions of the test
that's the easiest way to kind of cheat
some quick gains on a jump
score right you just start doing the
specificity of the actual test
so you might feel like rolling your eyes
those two answers but that's true like
if you just want to say they on paper
that they jumped higher because they did
a you know like a jump and reach test or
they did a
vert matte test you start doing that
outside of that
those are like the obvious ones for me
uh really something very simple would be
to start incorporating some either
volleyball specific type jumping so you
can include some like counter movements
some
static jumps from like a squat position
some what's it called where you
uh there's a word for it we run up and
kind of mimic doing a spike jump where
you do like a run and jump up on one leg
jump
very very simple things like that
generally they're going to be done at
you know like 90
85 to 85 intensity and up meaning like
mostly getting close to maximal effort
training i would also include some
maximal strength work in if they're not
already doing that and that should be
something that they do
i would say two times per week no less
than
one certainly if you're not doing any
maximal strength training then you're
you're
mostly already wasting your time so what
that would mean is like doing
you know some high bar squats for sets
of three like one to three ish that
would be really good
i'm trying to think of some other things
if they're proficient in the
weightlifting movements that's something
that you can include you can do some
pulls from the rack or some pulls from
the knee stuff like that
but after that it's really just kind of
like looking at what the actual jumps
that they need to do
and starting to rehearse those jumps and
working on the technique and then
looking at the intensity as you go
the thing with power training in this
case is it's not quite the same
as hypertrophy training where we say
increase the volume increase the volume
increase the volume
unfortunately doesn't work that way
because the sensitivity and fatigue
relations is very very low so one of the
things that you find is that
things like power speed ability
immediately start going down when the
prepared
excuse me the preparedness for those
things start going down when training
volume starts going up so this is
something where you might do
two to three sessions per week of
dedicated jump training
if they're not already doing a lot of
volleyball training if they are doing a
lot of volleyball training i would just
get most of their jump training from
that that would be the
most economical way of doing it mike did
i miss anything
or i felt like that was kind of vague i
don't know did i no that's
you knocked it out man okay yeah so i
think the take on i think mike
is probably going to agree with me on
this point if you have a person who is a
professional volleyball player and you
want them to be better at jumping
the the immediate problem i would see
here is they're only volleyball training
once per week
how do you get the most specific
volleyball jump training well you go and
do volleyball
so that i mean you can add more training
sessions
but then it's not a good economical use
of your time so you're adding things
that they could just be already doing in
the most
ecologically valid context possible
which is practicing volleyball
rather than having them come back to the
gym for a separate session to work on
all these other things
to me it seems silly the same argument
can be made and most of you have heard
me talk about this for conditioning and
small sided games
why have them come back and do separate
conditioning when you can just include
some small sided games into your
practice
where they get the most contextual
conditioning possible with the same
benefit it seems silly
yep all right up next
just below lucas tea carolina
this is a quick one can you expand on
the year-round heavy singles and rp 7-9
for power lifters as a way to one
conserve technique during hypertrophy
phases doing a low bar squat single
before the high bar squat volume for the
day and two judge how heavy you should
go for the day during strength phases
assuming it's not a super heavy single
how would you program them how many
sessions
how many times a week and it would rpe i
think james and i probably both agree
that that's just not the best idea in
the world
um and maybe somebody else is a
proponent of them that you had in mind
that maybe they can expand and why they
do it
we wouldn't be too terribly big fans of
it because
the benefits of keeping that uh
technique during hypertrophy phase is by
no means clear because you don't need it
during a portrait phase you're better
off putting more resources into
hypertrophy also when you get really
strong competition
lifting you need a big break from that
because it irritates your connective
tissues and joints in this very special
way
you need to back the fuck up away from
so you're doing high bar squats a lot of
times just to save the rest of your body
from low bar squats for example
and also you can always regain your
brilliant technique
when you come back to the squats later
and actually here's another really
interesting thing
your technique improves more if you take
occasional breaks away from doing it at
all
and come in and rework into it and it
works in every single sport
if you train something all the time you
develop a degree of stainless to it so a
virtual
face is a perfect example of how to move
away from the technique completely
and then when you come back to it you
you go really well and also is a good
uh big onus on this is because the power
lifting technique is really simple again
if you're a weightlifter you don't ever
want to get away completely from
snatches and cleaning jerks you might
want to go much lighter um but notice
it's also much lighter
very few weight lifters do like very
very heavy snatching cleaner jerk year
round
every weekend or whatever which is not a
really good idea because it's all the
same chronic injuries and so on and so
forth
secondly judging however you should go
for the day by doing a uh some kind of
rpe single we have a two factor problem
there factor one is this by numeries
clear how a low bar single translates to
your hybrid work
factor two is you don't you have to do
two independent judgments you have to
judge the rpe you think you got on the
low bar
squad and that's tough to do when you're
not even going to the limit
uh or even close for a single you know
like is it a seven or is it an eight who
knows
and then also like so there's that error
and then you multiply the error by the
error of applying it to the high bar
squat
so i would just say that hyper phase is
a great time to get away from all
competition movements if
for especially for more advanced folks
and then when you enter your strength
phase you start to weave the movements
back in
um if you really really want to keep in
their competition movements just for
technique
program them just for technique do a
couple of sets of three to five reps
light sixty to seventy percent and that
will allow you to have crisp technique
and also
the weight is low enough and you get
enough practice with it or you can
rework your technique a little bit
because like a one single doesn't even
hardly let you practice the fucking
technique yeah
learn hardly shit from that and share
ourselves not going to change it for the
better
so that's that's the the idea on that
james yeah i completely agree with dr
mike on there uh it's it's not that i'm
not
it's not that i'm against um maintaining
the technique per se i'm just against
doing like the heavy single
that seems just ridiculous for a variety
of reasons
i think that you can just do dedicated
technique work and
largely reap the same benefit even if
it's light um
if you are wanting to split the
difference because you don't like dr
mike and my
answer there you could consider uh like
maybe on your last hypertrophy block
before transitioning into a strength
block
that if you have any down sets to do on
squats that maybe you could do some of
your down sets as low bar
and that would help you transition so
that when you got to the strength block
you're kind of already
revamping your technique but again like
mike said
you want some time away from that
technique you want some time away to
heal
if you're feeling good and you know that
you take a little while to warm up to
high bar squats
that's something that you can do but i
do think you can get the same or very
close to the same benefit of just
keeping some technique work in
very light focusing on the bar position
your hand position things like that
um and get just as much out of it
excellent next up is paul
weisner with an awesome question oh
you're wisener guy
yeah man hi doctors is it a good idea to
use periodization for non-physical
activity such as studying for the sat
if so would you organize it into a
content phase as a base many quizzes to
establish pacing and then a lot of
practice tests
as peaking with high specificity so just
to answer generally periodization
works for anything you ever want to
improve the specific way the
periodization occurs
is of course specific to what you want
to improve but it works for everything
it works for sports it works for dancing
it works for studying
um your idea sounds pretty great
a similar idea i would have is to do
three phases
or generally you know it's not three
distinct phases it's like you know more
of the thing
that's in quote unquote phase one less
of the other two things and then it
slowly transmutes into more of the
middle thing and then more of the last
thing
so you start out studying for the sat
with yeah you might even take a a real
sat test once a week or once every two
weeks during that time
but what you mostly do is content like
you said like learning the stuff that i
sat is really going to be testing you on
to make sure you're really brushed up on
it because like
focusing on how to solve specific
geometry problems is not a good idea
until you've like reviewed geometry and
you're like oh yeah
angles right okay great so a lot of
content at first
then once your content is getting really
caught up
but you start to do more of and you do
this anyway more of
focusing on specific styles of questions
and strategies to answer them
because a big part of tests like the sat
is a very very predictable question
style
and they ask you questions in a way that
you might think is really really hard
but then when you read the sat book the
manual you're like oh
this question's not that hard they're
just looking for a real specific thing
and i know how to fucking answer that
thing because it was pretty obvious at
this point
um and there's some good strategies to
use for specific types of questions this
is also where you can learn where your
weakest and maybe where you can raise
your scores the most
and or where you're strongest and where
you can really do the best right but in
general
you want to focus on specific strategies
for answering kinds of questions groups
of questions
maybe some other stuff like that lastly
a part of the phasic structure you would
use
is more and more competition style work
where you do more and more subtests and
actual tests
uh to get used to specifically even
plenty of longer full tests
that's where the pacing comes in uh
because like if you've taken five
sats in the last two weeks before you
take the real one the real one's just
another fucking sat
you've already done really well in it
it's not you're not gonna be surprised
by anything
um but you can't as you notice the
pacing it let's
let's say we try the pacing stuff like
the actual take in the tests
first and do a lot of that first well
we're going to get stumbled up on these
questions that we don't have strategies
to end
anyway uh i don't know how much of that
anyone heard
but quick review is there's only one can
you still hear me james
there's there's really like if you try
to do any of the phases out of order it
doesn't make any goddamn sense you want
a phase
where you review your base stuff first
then a phase where you work on
different quantum question strategies
and then later you synthesize all of it
more so
you mind you do all these things the
entire time you just do more of them
towards the end
in that basic structure you get to feel
for the actual exam and that'll probably
prepare you for the best
yeah yeah i agree you can and take that
same idea as mike said earlier and apply
to
almost anything in life like first you
look at the fundamentals of whatever it
is that you're trying to do whether it's
knowledge or movement patterns or any of
those things
and just look at what are the basic
things that make up this bigger thing
that i'm trying to do
and then you start incorporating more
and more difficult aspects of it you
increase the specificity over time and
that's really just a matter of like kind
of
dialing up certain aspects of like okay
i have like content
dial here i have kind of like a
transition dial here and i have like a
competition
style dial here and i'm just kind of
fluctuating those things around and
it's very applicable to a lot of things
in life
next question is from nick alvaro
uh red or magenta n
he says g'day docs macros
should you include the protein from
vegetables and other indirect protein
sources
so there are multiple answers this all
of them are fine it's all about
consistency
so whatever you choose to do
consistently just keep doing it
what i tend to do um if i manually track
my macros
is i just count the calories full in all
the
stuff um but i count the uh
protein content in veggies and stuff and
complete sources is half
because it's really only halfway
anabolic with combined with other
sources
about uh and then that tends to work for
me
but you can count it full you could not
count it at all just when you don't
count it at all make sure not to extract
your calories from your
proteins and carbs and fats alone and
then you realize that you're like oh i'm
not eating so many calories but you're
eating a fuck load of
just not kind of the protein so make
sure you count your calories for what
they are
uh there's some argument that some of
the proteins don't even digest so you
can count them for fewer calories you
don't have to do that go that crazy
but uh generally speaking you can count
the proteins for whatever you choose
anything between zero tough cell
accounting for zero
half which is a good good sell full
which is great because it's simple
um any three of those is fine and then
make sure just cut the calories for full
in most
cases james yeah and like dr mike said
it's mostly a wash over time
as long as you do it consistently the
problem that you run into is if you
start mixing and matching
the vegetable sources or whatever it is
the whatever ancillary that you're
worried about
you start using different sources so
let's just say you were like a broccoli
man for a long time
and you're like man fuck this broccoli
i'm so sick of this broccoli
i'm gonna switch to like beans and
chickpeas
right now you have like a very big delta
in your ancillaries which is gonna throw
off whatever you have been doing for the
last
x number of months is it gonna be
massively off no
but it is going to be off a little bit
and you might have to course correct
if you are mostly using the same stuff
it doesn't matter a ton and as long as
you do it consistently
pick and choose what's the most easy and
practical for you to follow
how dare you how dare you mute me um
no i'm just kidding uh the dsl that does
this funny thing if the phone rings just
boots me off it's just like nah you're
done that's terrible
when is the shit getting resolved well
that's the thing they keep uh
it was supposed to be done in like
september and then they were like oh
june and then they were like so then we
were like okay it's june and they're
like oh
july akovid coved july 1st and then
we're calling and so we call in july and
they're like
we don't have any idea when this service
is going to be off oh my god
they fucking suck fuck centurylink um
who knows it's a it's just an
infrastructure thing so they they have
it like
pretty close up to our neighborhood um
they just have to like connect the lines
further down and then connect it to the
house
that's that's literally it it's just an
infrastructure thing so once it's
connected
done deal yeah whatever
all right let's go to id voca
[Music]
all right got it
in a recent q a john meadows mentioned
that muscle protein synthesis lasts
about 24 to 48 hours after your training
session for non-enhanced lifters
does that mean your muscle tissue has to
be fully recovered during that time span
personally need about four to five days
to fully recover after a deadlift
session
in the last week of a pile of building
mezzo i feel like i was in a very
one-sided fight with a school bus
do i need to reduce the volume intensity
to be able to take advantage of the 24
to 48 hour period for muscle protection
well so it's not 24 to 48 it might be
longer than that on some occasions maybe
up to
72 hours or something like that perhaps
even longer some cases
but generally muscle muscle grows
for you know about two to three days
okay and not much longer than that which
means that if you train once a week
that's fucking stupid
um now recovery in almost every case
lasts longer than how much net positive
protein senses you get
it's just a fact of the matter that
actually get more advanced your recovery
will
work on longer time scales so sometimes
you can only recover twice a week but
you're training
you know but muscle only grows half of
that time
because you just recovery takes that
long so
what you definitely want to do is design
your program in such a way that
stimulates a lot of muscle protein
synthesis but not
it's an excessive amount of damage that
you take way too long to recover
if you're getting just moderately sore
everything's going just fine
in your training two at least two times
a week you're in the ballpark so you're
totally good to go
because if you reduce your volume and
intensity a lot
you still might grow muscle for 24 to 48
hours or something
but the total amount of area under the
curve the height of the curve
is going to be reduced because you can
train as hard so you might actually grow
less muscle
if you just try to train really really
easy so if you're training at least
i would say generally two to four times
per week for muscle group you're totally
fine
and then you really can't train any more
often without a huge downside
of causing those curves to shrink anyway
so that would be my answer
but definitely don't train like once a
week or so yeah and the deadlift
specifically is kind of an outlier
in terms of a lot of exercises just
because the return the recovery time
scale is just inherently longer it's a
way bigger amount of muscle mass
it's a way bigger central and peripheral
nervous system demand
so i wouldn't um i wouldn't worry about
it too much so long as you're training a
lot of those other muscles like dr mike
said two to four times per week
what you might find yourself doing as
someone who moves into intermediate
advanced stages
of power building is having an a
kind of a non-linear deadlifting
schedule where you might only take
one or two really hard deadlifts
throughout a master cycle and then
either
light sessions or something else on the
other sessions where you would normally
deadlift and that's something that you
might find really really helpful
so you might do like a moderate deadlift
week one or deadlift week two
week three is like a light session
deadlift and then week four peak week is
like another really hard one
and then you go into deload and start
over
all right next question is riley
with a black just a black area
two questions here guys number one if
the muscle doesn't recognize weight more
so just tension
would it be more would be more fatigue
from work prior to lifting lead to any
change in hypertrophy if lighter loads
are used but the intensity is the same
yes totally
because your muscles be if you're tired
from work
you are systemically tired not just
tired and local muscles
and then your local muscles can't
produce as much tension
uh because they're capped by systemic
fatigue uh and even if they're tired
locally they
can't produce as much tension at the
local level and thus they don't
hypertrophy as much
so being tired sucks because the tension
produced by muscle is lower
and that reflects itself and how much
weight you use externally uh
but it's definitely a thing so be less
tired that's a good idea
and so that i'm totally totally in
agreement but just to just to throw your
point a little bone here
if you do find that you are really
fatigued from doing something
you're going to be more capped trying to
do heavy lifting than you are
lighter lifting so in terms of like a
less negative
or like a yeah like a lesser evil right
you might choose to do
like 10 to 20 or 20 to 30 rep range
because it's gonna be less inhibited by
systemic fatigue
than say five to ten rep range which is
like you're going to go and do your
first couple warm-up sets and be like
fuck this this is stupid um but it's
definitely going to
imp it's it's definitely going to be an
impediment in terms of how much growth
or how productive your training will be
number two when comparing stimulus to
fatigue ratio between various exercises
lotus stretch movements always feel best
but does this mean they're actually
better due to to their lower loading
capabilities
dumbbell press versus dumbbell fly
dumbbell curve will sink my curl
they're not better because of because of
their low loading capabilities they're
worse because of those
they're better because the loaded
stretch is an independent factor of
hypertrophy and fucking works really
well
um so if you can find an exercise which
allows a loaded stretch but allows also
heavy loading you really fucking won
uh deficit deadlifts are a great one um
you know rose
with you know with a camera bar or
something like that and a lot of times
on like something like dumbbell
uh curl like uh like if you're
uh ink lining or something like that
like you can actually lift a lot
like that and incline curl and a
dumbbell curl sometimes you can standing
dumbbell curl you can dumbbell more
because of like just leverage advantages
and not because your bicep is producing
more tension it actually could be
producing as much or more tension
beginning from a slightly pre-stretched
position which a lot of times is a
really strong position for a muscle to
begin with so
there's some real trade off there so if
you begin from such a stretched position
or go to such a first position that your
muscle
loses the ability to generate tension
that's poor technique and that's too
much like if you don't do dumbbell fly
so much that your elbows are completely
straight
and then just apply some work out
instead of a pack workout like that's
bad you went too low
but if you do dumbbell flies with like
super partial range of motion never get
the stretch that's bad
so the stimulus to fatigue ratio
checklist to the little proxy guide
of how much of a burn pump tension blah
blah et cetera you're getting soreness
is a really good way to figure out like
where that best trade-off is whatever
fucks up your pecs the most
in in some sense and pumps them the most
is really where that's better off
and you'll notice that that's somewhere
in a compromise between a really good
loaded structure position
and still mechanically advantageous
enough uh for you to generate high
forces
and again we've mentioned this before
but don't uh
it's easy to kind of make the ghetto mvv
mistake by looking at an exercise which
is an inherently lighter load so just
using the example he gave of dd press
versus db fly
and you might be like oh i get like such
better pumps and stuff from my db
fly why don't i do db press like it
seems like it's better well it's like
it's an inherently lighter weight
so in most cases not all you're probably
going to have slightly better mind
muscle connections slightly better
pumps things like that when you're using
a weight that's a little bit lighter
just because you can focus on those
things a little bit more
it doesn't necessarily mean it's better
it could be like a false positive in
many cases
but hypertrophy training in general is
very forgiving
in that regard in terms of exercise
order exercise selection
so like dr mike said you want to find
exercises that strike a balance between
those things
but also don't just be fooled like you
got a wicked pump from uh
inclined curls doesn't mean that db
curls like standing db curls are
are are bad or worse it just means that
that particular movement the incline
curl
was good that you were able the load was
probably lighter and such that you were
able to really get a good mind muscle
connection really focus on that movement
get a good
squeeze and you've got a fucking good
pump and burn and that's and that's fine
just be aware that there is that
potential to make a like a type one
error
when the exercises isn't when you're
comparing two different exercises for
the same muscle
and one is just inherently lighter than
the other one it's an easy mistake to
make
[Music]
all right let's do one last one because
this is the tenth question
and i think james i've got uh pretty
decent
go ahead i was just i spotted a name and
i i i'm guessing you're going to
gravitate towards the same name i'm i'm
i'm curious let me see what you i'm
going to see what you pick and then
rubius hagrid yes
that's very sweet um
the way we're probably gonna do this is
just scrolling down and finding
all of the highest voted comments that
appear first
so we'll miss some high voter comments
down later youtube algorithm doesn't
seem to want to bump them
but that's just the limitation of what
we're doing so
anyway okay here's the deal final
question
i believe let me make sure my notes are
correct yep final question so
rubius hagrid says asks are there
different kinds of muscle pumps and why
do different muscles
feel differently when pumped up for
example my chest feels different at the
pop my hamstrings where it's fairly
painful
it feels very deep in the muscle and is
very tight sometimes i have different
tricep pumps depending on the exercise
sometimes there's a chest pump
like a chest pop where it feels full
it's going to burst sometimes it feels
like a deep tight tension
fairly new training around eight months
out just might be misinterpreting what a
good pump is supposed to feel like
in the hamstrings so my best answer to
this is twofold one the reason that
pumps are differ
are different because muscles have
different architectures completely and
they
uh they're in a different part of your
body so sometimes muscle press up
against other structures you can really
really feel the pump as like a big
tension
um and sometimes uh they don't press up
on other structures so it's difficult
for you to feel the pump a lot and it
might feel a little bit different a
little bit of like a painful thing in
this
particular area uh all that being said
it's really not
um it doesn't net you i don't think
anything to really focus on exactly what
a pump feels like muscle to muscle to
muscle comparison like your
chest pumps and bicep pumps are going to
feel different from each other it's just
different muscle different location
different architecture different fiber
types potentially arrangement
of uh muscle fibers so what ends up
happening is
what you want to do is each muscle
compare the pump to itself
okay so like seated leg curl versus
lying like curl see which one gives you
a better pump and even better comparison
is like seated leg curl for sets of 10
versus seated electrolysis to 20 or
seated leg curl with your feet close
together see the leg really
wide together then you can start
comparing pumps and honestly like
it's really quite simple if the pumps
are equally sort of like
intense but different that's okay you
just rank them as equal and then both
exercises and whatever seem to be great
but if like one exercise just gives you
a fucking better pump than the other
even if they're slightly different pumps
and one's just like not as impressive
and that exercise that gives you a
better pump is probably on average a
wiser choice to use if you have only the
pump to narrow them down and there's
other ways you can choose exercises many
other ways
but like if you it's just one of these
things where if someone's like they do a
double press like the way you tell them
for the chest and you do like five sets
you know to failure do you have a pump
and they're like
not really and you do some other thing
barbell press some incline press or
something
and do five sets to failure like what
kind of pump do you have like dude i'm
dying like my chef my chest is going to
blow up
spaghetti style into my face i mean you
know i wouldn't really bet that that
that exercise the dumbbell press the
first exercise that doesn't give you a
pump i just wouldn't bet my money on it
causing a whole lot more hypertrophy
than the exercise that does give you a
big pump
so i would put my cards into that and do
it a little bit more often so that
that's my best answer james
yeah that was really good and uh
specifically with the hamstrings like
you brought up in the question
that's a tough one for me to like
because
i don't know if you feel the same way dr
mike but um like for me the only way i
get a pump
in my hamstrings is if i do lying leg
curls that's it period
but that doesn't mean that there aren't
other good hamstring options because
like doing a 45 degree back raise good
mornings stiff legged deadlifts
those will fuck my world up uh like
nothing else
but i can't really honestly say i get a
good pump during those it's something
where i feel it and i know they're
stretched i know they're working and
they feel disrupted
but do i feel pumped like doing an stiff
like a deadlift
not really even a 45 degree back raise
for like 15 reps do i feel pumped not
really
the only time i'll get that on the
hamstrings is if you're doing like a
more knee flexion heavy exercise so i
wouldn't
sweat this specific instance too much so
long as
you're following the other sfr
guidelines like dr mike said like
there's other ways to assess
whether or not that exercise is good for
you the pump is one of them but there
are others you can also look at
boom that's it i think that's it james
all right folks that was pretty good
there was some fun ones i was kind of
worried
that we were going to be on like because
i've been i don't know
if have you if you feel this way but
like um right now it feels like rir
is what mini cut was like a year and a
half to two years ago where it was like
mini cut questions many kind of
questions and now it's just like oh
right i'm kind of like hoping it doesn't
go that route
but it was good we had a good good
variety of questions some good things to
think about and uh this is a fun
exercise that
we've been doing this for years now and
i've always enjoyed this because it does
keep you sharp where you have to
sometimes you get something out of left
field and you're like oh i have to gotta
think about it a little bit yeah yeah
absolutely absolutely all right so folks
well done with questions especially
those of you adjusting to the new format
we really appreciate you sticking with
us and
continuing to engage with us make sure
you guys subscribe to the rp youtube
channel
there's going to be all sorts of fun
stuff coming up if you guys haven't seen
dr mike does a ton of like uh
fix your fix insert exercise videos and
there's all sorts of fun guests that he
has on there
i know we're working with maybe uh
having spencer do some videos of course
i'm gonna do some videos we've got tons
of stuff coming on the rp youtube
channel so make sure you subscribe
that way you get to see all the videos
when they come out and keep engaging
with us we really appreciate it
see you guys later next time
