very very hard
unfortunately i had killed my whole
village
i had to eat them only to become
stronger
for my country
[Music]
am i 33 he forgot how old he was
33 okay just being sure okay
my name is charlie jung i'm 33 years old
and i'm training for my first
bodybuilding show
my first bodybuilding show is in about
11
days so this week i am in las vegas
rounding out my final hard week of
training
with uh dr mike and jared feather
they're gonna make sure i push myself
adequately
for this last week of training and also
uh to help me uh brush up my posing
so this whole week we are filming every
single training session
uh so yeah that's 10 training sessions
so
stay tuned
[Music]
first working set of the last week of
our training before prep
i feel pretty damn good wait no i'm not
going to feel bad right
i'm so tired brother god work
so this is the first exercise of the day
he's going to be pushing a bit more
metabolites because
it's his last week of hard training he's
a little drier
he's really getting fatigued so we're
going to provide a
good stimulus today still to maintain
muscle tissue
by doing most of his top sets and then a
back offset of some intensity technique
stuff
going to keep him safer he's going to
provide again he's going to provide
stimulus to maintain his muscle tissue
and we're going to hop into the incline
hammer press or
whatever arsenal strength hammer press
and
see how he does
i got powerlifted probably from the age
of
i'd say like 21ish 22
up until three years ago four years ago
or so
i'm 33 now so i slowly made the
transition
uh three or four years ago over to
bodybuilding
i actually love hypertrophy training uh
more than strength training actually
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
flies i don't do flies today do you
[Music]
yeah but i'll do whatever i'll do let's
just stick to
what let's just stick the shit that's
not like overly eccentrically damaging
okay
so like this week good mornings are
probably even a stupid idea
straightly deadlifts take them out you
know what i mean
like you're going to maintain your
tissue
[Music]
some people take an artistic approach to
bodybuilding uh
i would say i take more of a
logical engineered approach to it very
much like a blueprint
it'll go by feel for the most part
i'm not saying i don't that i never do
it's just
for the most part you know that you
build this plan out as long as it's
logical
and it makes sense and you stick to it
i'm not saying you always have to stick
to it you have to make adjustments on
the fly if you need to
let's go big man
make it hard make it hard make it hard
squeeze
yes uh keeping charlie safe that's the
number one thing this week
so he's basically hopping in on i match
my mess cycle to him
he's hopping in on what i'm doing but
going a little closer to failure
so this is his final week flat dumbbell
press in a high rep range is going to be
just fine
we took out flies because they're super
essentially damaging we didn't want to
keep those in
so this will be his last pushing
exercise before biceps
[Music]
his chances to win the overall are very
high
he's the guy showing up that's like
other people are like man that one guy's
gonna show up and beat me
that's charlie so i've never competed
before
yeah you never know who's gonna show up
the shows but charlie
you don't see competitors like charlie
at the amateur level very often
uh he has a very high chance of
top two in any fucking category he does
and then even overall here's a very high
chance too especially if he comes in at
a super heavy weight
super heavyweight someone can condition
like this it's fucking tough
this is something i truly want to do and
i have this mindset that
i put myself in this position and i
wanted to be good at it
and i put up this plan i'm going to put
all this effort towards it
so why would i falter
and to be able to plan it all out
in a logical manner and be able to hit
those
points each little tick off the box
that's super like super gratifying
[Music]
we'll see
we'll see uh first session
of the last week of hard training before
my first show
uh i feel pretty good yeah it felt
pretty good going into
it so not surprised but uh
yeah i'm uh excited for the full week of
training ahead
and um can't wait for pm session in like
three hours
[Music]
[Music]
i
