if you just do 2hour arm workouts but
you do them for 4 days straight and then
take one day off you get pretty much all
the theoretical benefits of an 8 Hour
arm workout without any of the downsides
also you can actually spare two hours a
day every day probably if you're to
hardcore Fitness you can still go to
school you can still go to work you can
still go to Grandma's house and drop off
an apple pie and say hey Grandma you
know um you're easily my favorite
grandparent he like oh Sunny that's okay
but you know why you're not my favorite
you're like wait really why why not
you're too big of a to do rich Pian 8
arm work out you little get out my house
and I'll see you in8 hours like oh God
damn it grandma was right
