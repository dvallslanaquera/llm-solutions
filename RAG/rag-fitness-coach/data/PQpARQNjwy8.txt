for the low bar squat we follow all the
same rules with regular squatting
chest always stays up
shoulders are always back
we always sit back onto our heels and
the first movement when you're going
down is your hips traveling back not
your knees traveling forward
but in the low bar squat our bar
position is going to be slightly
different
our bar position is going to be
just under the traps okay so lauren go
ahead and set up your lower low bar
position
perfect it's not on the traps it's right
below
and you're going to have your elbows
held high
and you're going to set up a shoulder
with stance as usual and you're going to
squat back and down keeping your chest
up
this is a pretty rough movement
but it's your strongest possible
squatting position and keep that bar
pinched by keeping your shoulder blades
back push that butt back real far and
keep your chest up squat all the way up
and down
and when you rack just walk right on
into the supports
perfect
