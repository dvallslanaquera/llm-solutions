every rep you do the vein in your
shoulder pops out a little bit more
yeah come on
[Music]
youtube
hello
guess what we have a new friend
let's introduce the old friends first
they're boring charlie jung you're all
familiar there he is he's korean um he
forgot how to speak english so he will
be
saying minimal things maybe korean
things
maybe not
jared feather
he is missouri's
prodigal son
and my son as you guys all know i raised
him myself to play high school football
and boy did he do well
i'm dr mike gizertal of youtube you know
me already
and this
is none other than
mr
you will call him mr mufu although it's
juji mufu
the real name
and he is here to join us for just a
regular old boring push session he's
done enough fuckery in his life on
youtube and i'm sure more to come now we
slow the pace down we do the full rom
things and generally just god damn
admire how fucking much of a physical
specimen he is damn i i have body
dysmorphia i'm looking at you guys going
i gotta stand on the edge here and and
throw my left arm out just so i look i'm
just going like this like i'm not just
shrinking
he's got his shorts on so then i'm
trying to hide man look at this
sweatshirt by the way just just to be
clear
again
i've made a lot of money through our
people over my life only walmart touches
his fucking body you guys see the shit
walmart baby we dripping with wall swagu
but enough about that you ready yeah
let's do it
yeah feel free to let's get warmed up
only walmart touches his cybex smith
machine damn straight
that's actually home depot but define
american store homer's d pot all right
folks exercise number one is going to be
medium close grip ish smith machine
bench press so that's a 10 to 20 reps i
think i'm gonna be at the top end of the
range use a slighter slightly lighter
weight the other folks may be at the
lower end of that range using slightly
heavier weight
um no wrong answers full range of motion
good control a couple sets here get the
pecs popping triceps popping um this is
as close of a grip as i can take without
not being able to touch my chest so it's
close grip for me
um don't put on a lot of muscle because
you can't do all the exercises properly
anymore
how fucking heavy is that thing um
you know i don't have my own smith
machine yet so
okay i'm getting one
that sucks
you know i was uh
i don't know if you remember in the
early 2000s all the propaganda on blog
articles online about smith's machines
how terrible they were oh yeah they're
like one of my favorites is by eric
krusty 10 uses for a smith machine and
they're all like hang your laundry yeah
that's your ability exercises and stuff
like that it's just a joke but
oh that's creative or
yeah well arms even easier yes then you
can just
you know
mike yeah i'm showing them this because
of you
i yeah mike has a hard time getting out
of i'm jewish and i don't have what they
call athleticism
i was born without it
hey what did i just teach you
uh get back down there this will stop
oh here we go
watch your head
there you go see
it's all in your head
literally
literally almost took my mohawk off
nice
good
speed come on
[Music]
oh yeah
good god dad
every rep is like perfectly the same
this is incredible
come on come on 20. go
all right that was incredible actually i
gotta say i've never seen someone do a
set of 20 like that where every rep was
exactly the same people say they can't
tell if i'm just looping the same rep
on video or if it's actually a set that
was really impressive people never say
that nobody ever talks to me
you're the first person to be my friend
with you
i've never heard that in my life
come on smooth
there you go go go go
world's heaviest smith i told you it
catches up the first rep doesn't feel
like shit and then you're like jk
it's heavy but it's also
the forester's weird yes it gets harder
as you push up
it's accommodating weird it really is
yeah it's really it's really gonna go
down now yeah dude that's
because i can tell when i'm about to hit
like a wall
[Music]
15 let's get it
oh yeah
yeah come on seventeen okay
nice well
i tried you and i did good enough you
did very well always taking bets oh
let's take some bets what am i getting
15 with this
i'll go to failure failure yeah so like
stick around i feel affiliated yeah yeah
you're gonna get fucking 20.
17.
i'm going to consistently underestimate
you to motivate you
like 18 to 20 for sure so somebody's
going to try to find point i'll do 19
oh my come on come on
come on
[Music]
oh
20 was the first number i said how many
was it 20 yeah son of a bitch
you know what to your advantage jared
i usually don't do a four-man rotation
so i rest much less ah so
yeah
i should have should have just fucking
excuses piling up why he doesn't train
so hard all the time i usually just let
him lie to himself i let him get done
with a set then i'm like you fucking
suck
here film this you see he actually
pulled a peck in the process because
what happens when he goes
he's trying to pull it a little bit more
let me get a fucking pump huh
seven
[Music]
against the spider
10
good job
what happened
or above oh yeah
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
do more
[Music]
yep
yep
yes lock it
beautiful nice
[Music]
good shit
come on come on
that's all you get your last set on this
hell yeah good stuff nice
listen
thank you so much well for what
and the funny faces oh
skull crushers
so what's a i'm going to skip ahead
what's the third exercise
deficit push-ups okay by the time skull
crushers are done with you deficit
push-ups are going to be really
difficult okay so question you're you're
you gotta this is primarily chest for me
yes and then we're moving to a triceps
yes we go back to chest we go to an
exercise it's relatively close grip
deficits but because they're done right
after skull crushers your triceps are
much more of a limiting factor than you
would think just really kind of both
okay it's
so
your chest is contributing large
fraction of the work but your triceps
are closer to failure so as far as
number of effective reps the reps really
close to failure that really grow muscle
them the most your triceps get a huge
hit out of those stuff supporting okay
yeah you'll see we'll get a big ass pump
oh i'm wrong about everything
skull crushers
dad did him grandpa did him
uh
we did the benching that was fun
staying on the smith doing smith's calls
try them they're really nice
make sure you have your bench where you
need it otherwise you can feel it
awkward
position the bar here here here here
no wrong answers just make sure the
triceps shit load attention especially
at the bottom try to keep your elbows in
as much as you can and whatever you do
don't be like this guy end up like
fucked up weird
bearded long haired
oh thanks lebron
anyway
so that's a 10 to 20 reps about four
sets here
some heavier some later as we get tired
yeah hey who's gonna clean this up
who's gonna clean up jujit
i'm not youtube famous like you i don't
have a crew fuck
i
bye
my ass my
great there's no faking this is there
shit
how do i take my way out of this yeah
they weren't you can't commercial yep
all the way down john all the way down
touch the nose
yes
so why don't you uh push your hips a
little bit forward other way other way
yep yeah there you go and then you can
touch maybe like close to the forehead
but that will give you some more range
yeah there you go
i had to bring my head to it yeah
you don't have to touch all the way down
but go super deep
yes good
come on
a little faster a little faster on the
out there we go
[Music]
here we go
nice
you guys aren't allowed to critique my
technique charlie
i was giving you a support just kissing
what did he say i said him and mike
aren't allowed to critique my skulls
technique because they're like this
these shoulders can't bring them
jared says he's our supposedly hates us

technique modifications over time as i
talk shit so it's really it's all love
when you die i will dance

he's just no yes people looking up to
like giant idiots yeah giant idiot and
giant idiot number one right here
i'm not that big i am an idiot as soon

more comfy
feet over there yeah
very strict push-up very straight
