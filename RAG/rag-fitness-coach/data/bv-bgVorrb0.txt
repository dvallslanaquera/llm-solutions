hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i forgot my last name
maybe some of you could remind me in the
comments
good foods versus bad foods
forget dc versus the marvel universe
this is the real battle of our time it
sounds like a whole lot of bs let's find
out why so here's the deal
people talk about and constantly search
for good foods and bad foods one of the
most prominent examples of this i can
think of off the top of my head
is like i said this in an earlier video
my dad actually watches most if not all
of my youtube videos and he also watches
the commercials before the video and
during and after
and uh sometimes it watches that like
you know like when one of the ads is
like six minutes long and it's really
just an embedded youtube video for some
other person my dad does that shit so
there's this guy named dr gundry who i
think was like a pretty good medical
doctor and he decided to just sell out
make money saying nonsense so
he like uh one of these commercials i
was like chilling with my dad and i was
like bucket i'll watch this with you
it was like going through random foods
and he was like tomatoes they're bad
because there's like one ingredient this
other food they're good because this one
agreed and i was like holy shit they
still do this so it's definitely a thing
people still do they're always trying to
look good or bad and this comes not from
just evil former medical doctors
that are just trying to make money at
everyone's expense
offense intended
there is another group of people much
larger and more innocent or just regular
folks who just don't know any any better
you know and they come to diet and
nutrition in an attempt to lose weight
or become healthy or you know
get into better shape
somehow and a lot of times they come
with no heuristic no sort of
representational schema of what they're
looking at and the first layer they can
apply the first filter is well you know
they say can you tell me what's good
foods and what's bad foods what they
really mean is foods that i should be
eating and foods that i maybe shouldn't
be eating because like in a lot of
things if you get specific enough
good and bad really do
can be understood as an effective way to
generalize about the world
however
just good and bad foods with no goal in
mind
is totally wrong because just by
themselves good and bad are really moral
questions right and food isn't a moral
thing it can only help you get closer to
a goal or make getting closer to that
goal marginally more difficult and she
wiz you know that doesn't sound like
good versus evil because it's fucking
not so
what kind of goal really matters and
once you get specific on the goal and
you still try to apply good and evil it
still makes a ton of mistakes so for
example
weight loss is your goal does that mean
peanut butter is a bad food like
i don't know
if you have a certain amount of it
that's not over your calories or macros
no
okay but if you have a ton of it then
yeah
what about muscle gain well if you push
muscle gain high enough you have to
contract how many veggies you're eating
otherwise they take up too much room in
your stomach they make you super full
and you're not able to really push the
caloric surplus as high as you'd like so
like are veggies bad
like gee i wouldn't really say they're
bad it's a little bit more logical and
less emotional than good and bad and
then what about health if you're
optimizing for health does that mean
grandma's homemade chocolate chip
cookies you know them shits that like
break off and the fucking they're gooey
and the chocolate chips slide apart like
they only do in the commercials or at
grandma's house
and then at one point you visit grandma
and the cookie slides apart but it's
like somebody's like finger and you're
like what the fuck can you look over and
grandma's eyes are bloodshot she's
like wouldn't that be a cool movie
that's probably been done a hundred
times in any case if you you know
grandma's like oh would you want some
cookies sonny she hasn't remembered your
name in years and you're like no grandma
those are bad
come on now grandma's not gonna make
sense of that shit her cookies are bad
like did she intention them to be bad
she's gonna feel guilty that's crazy
right so good and bad like that's some
cool stuff that is really good for
children like you know you don't want to
expand on the reason
that kids shouldn't be doing xyz or
should be doing xyz if they don't have
the cognitive bandwidth to understand
the reason you can just overlay good and
bad and when they get smart enough
they'll say why oh i'm glad you asked i
have good reasons but we're dealing with
adults who mostly other people choosing
their foods and subscribing to diets and
all this other stuff good and bad it's
just not really useful terms imagine
this in any other context like
imagine you're buying a computer online
that you're buying a new laptop and your
friend is like a computer expert and
you're like hey which which computers
are good and which ones are bad he's
like
well it's really like a price and
performance spectrum really had some
some some computers are probably not
worth the value and some are uh
overpriced underpriced etc good and bad
geez a little bit more complex than that
you know military hardware like is that
a good tank or a bad tank it's like
you know um it's got 10 different
performance metrics you can test it on
it gets a certain grade but if one tank
gets a 72 out of 100 and one take it's a
75 out of 100 is one of them good and
bad compared to what the thing is the
real world is a little bit more
complicated and a little bit less
emotional than good and bad so we should
probably not try to look at foods as
much with good and bad but is this food
in this amount
going to get me closer to my goal or
make that journey closer to the goal a
little bit more difficult than it has to
be i know that's a bit more complex than
good and bad but g was it's also a whole
lot more useful
so
if we say okay peanut butter is bad
veggies are bad cookies are bad
and per the goal we can still use good
and bad but even then like per the goal
you have to include the quantity
and the macronutrient composition to see
if a food is good and bad for that goal
so for example if someone's on a fat
loss diet
and they go hey
can i have a cookie and i go
yes
and i go okay great so cookies are good
hold on
if you asked me can i have 10 cookies i
would have said no they're like okay so
one cookie's fine but 10 is bad no
it is not this is not a bimodal
distribution with the insane valley of
good bad okay that's not one in ten
five cookies is neutral that doesn't
affect your metabolism that's how it
works
cookies have a certain amount of
calories certain amount of fats proteins
carbs
if that fits and plugs in to your daily
plan which if you use the rp diet coach
aperture can automatically shameless
plug
then
then a cookie's fine
if on top of that another intellectual
layer of if the cookie's fine to hit
your macros and calories but after
eating just one you want a bunch more
and you get super rebound hungry and
you're miserable then all of a sudden
it's bad so what is good and what is bad
is so context dependent depending on at
least three things macros calories and
hunger signaling now all of a sudden
every food isn't good and bad it's like
good and bad in context imagine playing
like uh one of those like video games
where you have no friends and role
player games that's right um and
someone's like oh i got the staff of
dildon or some shit and you're like is
that a good weapon to have you're like
well i'm level eight yes because it's
the fire level but on level 10 it's the
underwater level it doesn't actually
work like even in video games the shit
is too complex and that's as simple as
it gets to say anything good and bad
like i leave that shit for
four-year-olds this is my humble
recommendation here's another cool fact
even junk foods which we could say okay
those are bad right
they are okay as long as most of your
intake is fundamentally healthy foods
like veggies fruits whole grains lean
meats healthy fats then you can have up
to 25
per day every day of a good deal of junk
food and most doctors and medical
procedures can't even tell
your health differently for years and
potentially ever but there's not a
situation in which someone's like i'm
gonna be healthy and leave for longevity
and they have one cookie and everyone
around them is like fucking no
it's a fucking scream painting by who
the fuck was that is that van gogh
scott is the scream by van
gogh fucking good enough
you're googling it
edward edward munch
we get out of here really yeah yeah
that's embarrassing who the fuck is that
guy fuck that guy the scream is by van
gogh i stand correct
so in any case it's not true that one
cookie's gonna fuck you up because it's
a bad thing right
it's all in context all in the margins
where like some things are more clearly
good and bad notice i said more not
completely but you know like if you get
a gun out and shoot grandma in the face
in the middle of the street it's
probably more good and bad more on the
bad side but even there there's context
to nuance what if like you know you had
very good reason to believe that
grandma was like a sleeper cell agent
with a fucking nerve gas balloon instead
of a stomach she was just going to go
into a big ass church in new york city
and
your gas comes out of her mouth i don't
know then yeah grandma gets a fucking
cap to the face fuck that bitch but
again good and bad is very childlike
don't work super well for most of life
and because food and diet nutrition are
most of life they probably won't work
here
that well either so next time someone
asks you or you overhear and you rudely
insert yourself into the conversation
you know is a food good or bad
you can at least ask well good or bad
for what
right ask them and usually they don't
know but then you can start to tell them
about the topography of the situation
they'd be like hey i'm eating cookies is
that bad which is every time i fly on a
fucking plane without fail
someone next to me begins to eat and
because i'm that fucking heart i notice
i notice my surroundings unless you fly
with me when i'm on a shitload of
edibles and i may not notice anything or
really notice it i look over and a lot
of times i get the reaction of like i
know these are bad and i'm like um yeah
that's right i look like this
and i gotta be like well bad for what
and they're like
for health right and i'm like well you
know you seem to have a healthy body
weight and if a cookie a few cookies
every now and again it's no big deal and
they're always like oh my god like
they're like really sometimes they're
disbelief and sometimes they're relieved
um and sometimes they even offer me a
cookie and then i'm like i don't i don't
uh eat that shit i don't let that poison
touch my body fun story randomly my
friend marcos rodriguez at mr marcos on
instagram it'll be fun when this video
hits and you guys all follow him at the
same time but once marcos and i were
flying to california from the east coast
and uh we were sitting next to this
absolutely lovely uh older indian woman
who indian american and she's like so
see i have a young son and he's thinking
about supplements do you guys take
creatine and i began to open my mouth to
be like well no
totally fine and monohydrate's the best
and don't get the stuff that is super
expensive i was like
and marco says like absolutely not i
don't put that poison in my body it took
me everything not to just start laughing
and laughing and laughing luckily i was
like uh and marco's corrected himself
and i helped but it was just amazing i
was like god damn this this woman is
going to leave thinking creatine is
poison which again wouldn't surprise
anyone there's like a lot of people say
like the school nurse you know my doctor
says creatine is poison it's bad lots of
good and bad thinking everywhere right
here's the thing
most bad foods are good at at least one
thing taste
right almost no one eats junk food that
tastes bad at least not to them you
imagine someone just eating like
i don't know
a bowl of lard and you're like
what the fuck are you doing like man i
love it i can't i can
junk food's the best you're like what
junk food at least tastes good and every
now and again in the context of a plan
it's awesome to just have really tasty
food so already the food can't be good
and bad because good and bad for what
like you don't see kids having a pizza
party you're like jesus that's it our
country's ruined you know that's not how
it works
there's nothing
at all wrong with eating junky tasty
food in the context of a well-balanced
diet and a healthy amount of physical
activity there's nothing wrong with it
because
demonizing foods calling foods good and
bad
is say with me now
bullshit
see you guys next time
you
