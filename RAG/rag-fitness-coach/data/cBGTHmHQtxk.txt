hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization
today's video is a bit of something
different a bunch of folks have been
asking me
about
doug brignol i
hope i'm saying his name right dog sorry
if i screwed up your last name i figured
it was either brignor but ignore
something sufficiently italian and a lot
of folks on my instagram and on youtube
uh have been asking me to sort of give
an analysis of his methods and claims
and you know a bunch of people make
youtube videos they'll say oh everyone's
been asking and no one's been asking um
i just generally don't like to make
videos like this i like to let people do
what they do and
let the customer choose from a plethora
of options using their own intelligence
and i don't really like to ever weigh in
on other folks plans and methods and
stuff like that it feels me
uh it leaves me feeling a bit weird but
realistically a crapload of people have
been asking so gotta get this off my
chest make this video
uh give you guys what you want to see
and that is my analysis of doug's
training methods so who is doug and what
are his methods he's a former top-tier
competitive bodybuilder he's like i
think 50 something and he looks
phenomenal and he's super super jacked
back and i think the 80s so really guy
who walks the walk and the awesome thing
about him is that him and his team
they really think about training they're
not just like do this shut up which is
really really refreshing to see it's
really really good and it's kind of his
core offering or maybe best phrased as
his most popular offering that what has
garnered a lot of attention and a lot of
the questions to myself
is the brig 20 which is a list of 20
exercises
that are um
the best exercises is claimed for all of
the muscles of the human body that you
would like to develop
and this is kind of an analysis of sort
of that line of thinking here
so what's the gist of
the claims that are being made
um
[Music]
i suppose there are sort of three kind
of things i take away from
uh from doug brignol's methods one is
that it's important to use biomechanics
insight to inform exercise choice you
don't just want to choose exercises
willy-nilly you want to give them some
thought especially from a biomechanical
analysis which muscles are affected
which joints are involved
what's the sort of force production
going on is there may be a more
efficient way to do things
so that's part one
part two is not only should we use
biomechanics but exercises can be
analyzed biomechanically for productive
outlets for example
you know how much is the target muscle
working versus how much external loading
is being presented to the joints and
connective tissues and maybe if the
muscle in an exercise isn't working a
ton but there's a crapload of stress on
the joints is that really the best
exercise to be using and maybe the
answer is no
and
point three is that such an analysis
using primarily biomechanical inference
can rank order exercises
at least very charitably into the best
exercises meh exercises and why would
you do that exercises
and i think in the break 20 it's more
specifically like well i actually hear
the best and everything else is maybe
not as good
so
uh what's an example one of the examples
given in a variety of the sort of
literature that's being produced in
videos
is uh and there's
more than a few of these it's like if
you're doing regular barbell squats
there's a ton of tension on the quads at
the bottom of the movement but as you go
up higher and higher the movement what
ends up happening is the quads
contributing less and less because
they're very very biomechanically well
leveraged at that point the external
load is the same so you can kind of
coast through the top half top third of
the movement and not get a ton of quad
activation because the quads really
aren't pushing against much of anything
on the other hand something like cc
squats especially in the sissy squat
machine which you you put your feet in
and you can actually push against the
pad and sit back and come back up you
guys like this digital little like cgi
shit i'm doing with my fingers
in such a sissy squat setup not only is
there a lot of force at the bottom of
the movement where the quads have been
fully stretched but also there's a force
all the way through the movement because
you're using not just a leg press motion
to stand up but a combination press and
extension
and so even at the very top of the
movement the quads are still very well
engaged in the sissy squat which would
hypothetically make the sissy squat
or some version of it
superior to the barbell squat at least
in this example because it allows the
muscle to remain more active for more
time and actually challenges it at
various degrees of motion versus just
really challenging at one and not a ton
of the other right so perhaps cc squats
are the superior um from the perspective
especially of how much external load
they impose which isn't that much versus
how much biomechanically inferred muscle
activation they demand so uh some solid
stuff here
and
uh i'll sort of lay out my agreements
with what i think i agree with as far as
these perspectives and apologies full
well in advance if i have miscarriage or
anything it is not intended maliciously
is purely by my uh
inability to read things on the internet
and get an accurate perspective i will
say a lot of the stuff is paywalled as
damn well should be if you want
information you should be fucking ready
to pay for it if you're really serious
about muscle growth so i do encourage
you to go out there and um if you're
really really curious about the methods
buy the courses sign up for the stuff
and you'll really be um learning a whole
lot more than i did just perusing the
free shit and trying to infer off it so
if i mischaracterize anything my huge
sincere apology here so take all the
shit with a big ass grain of salt like
anything i would say you know i'm
probably half wrong um
so i'll do my agreements with what i've
seen and then my disagreements are at
least sort of questions as to maybe why
i'm skeptical about some of the stuff
going on so my agreements on the whole
situation so
it's definitely a good idea to use
biomechanics and training analysis if
you're completely ignorant biomechanics
then you know you're going to have some
problems with choosing exercises that
just don't make any damn sense uh one
easy one is like should you swing on the
way up with lateral raises well
biomechanically where is the swinging
motion generator from it's generated
from your legs
maybe your back so does that actually
help activate the side delts no so why
would you swing to use more weight why
would you want to do that
to grow your legs if that's not even
enough load to grow your legs it's not
sufficiently fatiguing so you end up
just with a very sort of straightforward
biomechalic analysis which is really
good idea
you can say oh maybe swinging's not a
good idea so that's a good example
number two
it's definitely a good idea to try to
develop some kind of ranking system so
you can sort of ordinarily rank
between probably better exercises and
probably worse like for building quads i
would say like high bar squat hack squat
leg press somewhere up here in my view
and then like bosu ball one legged squat
with somebody yelling at you all the way
down at the bottom uh
insert your favorite joel seidman
reference here so uh definitely a good
idea to have that sort of scale and a
very commendable that doug and his folks
are doing that sort of thing
and
some of the exercises and in fact quite
a few
of the ones recommended by doug and his
team are some combination of a few
really good things very inventive uh
quite unique
relatively low in total body stress so
especially if you're injured or
something like that like in your lower
back or upper back you can't impose
heavy loads on squats like precious hack
squats maybe some of the sissy squat
stuff really is up your alley and some
of them seem to be fairly effective at
least as far as from
what i would term a notional analysis or
just look at something
that seems to be probably a good
exercise and some of the stuff i have
tried and actually is very good
um and thus that makes a lot of his
movements candidates for you to try out
on your own training so
definitely some really good stuff going
on there that's the agreements
uh now uh my sort of uh disagreements
with uh
directions i think i'm going a bit of a
different way um than doug and and the
folks who espouse some of his
philosophies right
so
number one
uh disagreement these aren't ranked in
any kind of order ironically
measurements made
by biomechanical inference alone
are very very fraught
so you don't want to use biomechanical
inference in other words doing some back
of the envelope calculations
and sort of really judiciously saying
this exercise wins on that calculation
this exercise loses thus this exercise
is superior and this is inferior
biomechanics is not the only thing you
consult the way muscles are shaped is
actually different inside the muscle
itself and the way they're attached to
various joints is not something you can
replicate very easily with just like a
very simple model
and
how exercises stimulate muscles can be
actually a bit more nuanced than just
straight biomechanical analysis would
imply
just a really quick example you'd say
well you know the bench press is
inferior because towards the bottom of
the movement you have really good pack
activation but as the movement reaches
the top and maybe dumbbell press and you
get here you don't have a lot of
activation in the pecs at the top so
you're missing something well
stand alone that seems fine but then you
actually combine that with the research
that shows that probably you get more
growth at the bottom super deep painful
stretch of a movement than you do at the
top when it's not the muscle is
contracting and not in a lengthened
position then all of a sudden it seems
like wait so if like things like squats
and
um
presses are very hard at the bottom
easier at the top
that doesn't match the perfect linear
force curve that we would sort of say oh
biomechanically this would be ideal
but it actually matches the force curve
of what causes hypertrophy more
so it turns out that a perfectly linear
force curve same amount of sort of
necessity for your muscles to contract
here and here may actually not even be
desirable and it may actually be less
efficient so just on that alone
biomechanical inference
should be something you
tread very lightly on very carefully and
also not invest a lot of stock into
is also prone to considerable errors
if you want you can google and this is
up on the slides hopefully right over
there evaluating the efficiency of a
resistance exercise and just if you want
to type in dips
comma dumbbell extensions
uh this is uh sort of in doug brignol's
blog it's a sort of sub-article in his
blog where he analyzes dips versus sort
of dumbbell skull crushers and
does some mathematics um
to sort of suggest one muscle is or the
triceps are being uh externally loaded
to a certain extent and internally to a
certain extent there's like this 11
multiplier for wrist position and stuff
like that um uh without getting into the
um the physics of it that that analysis
is like uh how do i phrase this
charitably
uh woefully inaccurate uh it's just all
kinds of wrong so
um he ends up saying that you know the
perceived or the sort of required force
within the muscle for skull crushers
with 20 pounds
is way higher than the force required
when you do full range of motion dips
still on the triceps with 200 pound body
weight individual um if you've ever done
skull crusher with 20 pounds uh
to failure or otherwise and dips
weighing 200 pounds you can instantly
see that
the intramuscular force on the tricep as
perceived by your sort of tended
integrity at the time
you know man it's a really tough picture
to paint the math is wrong too
by itself but even just at
a glance it seems curious and is in fact
wrong and it's very easy to be wrong in
biomechanics uh just by making a few
assumptions that seem correct but but
are in fact not correct so uh gotta be
really careful about that i will add
another thing
when you guys go out to the world and
you know you're consuming exercise
science knowledge from as many people as
you can which is a great idea
uh there have been recently sort of a
uh perhaps a perceived inflection of
folks
um
using biomechanics as kind of a buzzword
like yeah but have you thought about
biomechanics about cancer's cool and all
but it says some kind of thing you
sprinkle on and makes everything better
and it is a thing that can be really
fucked up
so
anytime someone says well
biomechanically
i would take that with a huge grain of
salt okay and so more on that later so
we can make biomechanics inference a bit
better by actually strapping electrodes
to the muscles and then doing emg
electromyography to figure out how
active the muscles are in certain
positions that uh can we can dispose of
sort of just biomechanical
calculations on a physics perspective
and actually measure muscle activation
that makes it much better um i haven't
seen any emg data from from this group
of folks from from doug's propositions
maybe it's out there maybe i've missed
it but even with emg um
in the research community emg for
exercise science applications is
notoriously bad notoriously bad huge uh
problems with signal-to-noise ratio huge
error rates sometimes exercises that are
sort of known by people to cause more
disruption more soreness bigger pumps
everything like that or mainstay
exercises and growing a muscle group are
shown through emg to be inferior to
exercises that like i didn't even know
that muscle was really active a ton in
that exercise so it leaves you thinking
gee is there something being missed and
almost certainly
the top folks doing emg research will
tell you yeah it's something you take
with a huge huge fucking grain of salt
and and uh
you have to use other methods and emg by
itself can't be reliably like well this
wins on amg and this loses so uh we have
to do the thing wins right so that's
point number two
point number three
in my view we may have some superior
ways to judge exercise ratios of
stimulus to fatigue and these are the
stimulus and fatigue proxies that myself
and the folks at renaissance
periodization have sort of thrust into
the spotlight and you may be familiar
with them with a bunch of youtube videos
about them see if you google any of them
or just uh youtube stimulus to fatigue
ratio and i talk about it in like at
least three videos so you're blue in the
face and don't give a shit anymore um
and these are things like how much
tension are you perceiving in the muscle
so for example if someone's like hey
like try the skull crushers like this
and you're like okay i feel my triceps
same load and they're like try them like
that and you're like holy fucking shit i
really feel like my triceps pulling like
crazy
this is probably not wrong it may be
wrong but at least if you feel a shit
load of tension in your triceps doing an
exercise one way or doing another
exercise or doing the same one a
different way would you feel much less
tension
i don't know man it kind of seems like
the high tension exercises on average
are probably better and it doesn't end
there another one is burn okay if i tell
you hey listen
the way i'm having you do lunges it's
gonna fuck your glutes up and you do the
lunges do lunges through lunges and i'm
like what do you think where do you feel
it you're like
my quads are on fire and i'm like ah and
what about your glutes you're like i
don't know i don't feel my glutes no
burn nothing uh you know are we really
to believe that this is a huge glute
targeting exercise that
you say well hey won't my quads get
bigger too i'm like nah this isn't a
quad exercise but my quads are burning
like crazy does that mean something
doesn't mean the amount of ions from
extreme muscle contraction close to the
limit are really high in that quad
muscle and thus isn't that probably mean
that's getting stimulated i'm like no it
doesn't mean anything right oh boy you
know i think it probably means something
another one is pump if i tell you hey le
this exercise is going to target you
know your chest and your triceps and i
have you do it and you do three or four
sets you're like dude my pecs are
fucking splitting off of my chest pumped
and i'm like what about your triceps and
you're like and
like nothing happened or just barely
anything and i'm like this is supposed
to be mostly a tricep exercise like i
can tell you that
but like if you keep doing sets and i'm
like triceps and you're like
i'm like well your pecs shouldn't be
active you look like you're doing it
right i'm like my pecs are going to blow
up the only thing i can tell you is not
a biomechanic second layer that's going
to say well this isn't very likely
stimulator for your chest if you're
getting enormous pumps anywhere
you're probably going to see some
stimulus of growth it's a pretty decent
proxy in in all likelihood maybe not by
itself but with all these other factors
definitely something
another one is uh perturbation or
weakness if i have you do something that
let's say trains the rear delts some
kind of rolling upright growing movement
when your rear delts feel fine they feel
super strong normal after multiple sets
five sets but your biceps like every
time you move them they cramp on you and
even just sitting there they're kind of
like oscillating you're like oh shit
my biceps are fucked up and you try to
do curls with your normal load and
you're super weak like
wasn't there something in the bicep that
wasn't the bicep drained of something
isn't that something also probably
stimulative i feel like they were worked
right if you're super weak in a target
muscle but i'm like no no no it's
another muscle that's targeted am i
really convinced i'm not sure about that
another one is disruption and soreness
which is super straight straightforward
if i show you an amazing adductor
exercise but you end up having just
fucking crazy sore hamstrings and your
actors feel fine
do you believe me that it's really an
adductor exercise i wouldn't believe
myself be like oh hold on a second if
the adductors are being trained that
means they're probably being pushed to
their limits
and you're saying the hamstrings aren't
really retrained here how did they get
sore how do you get a muscle sore if you
don't push it to its limits and if you
do push a muscle really to its limits
especially if it's your first time using
exercise especially if you're really
trying and it doesn't get sore maybe
that doesn't mean anything but you sure
would like it to get at least a little
twinge of sword be like okay i'm not
insane this really is working my
adductors because again the
biomechanical inference huge mistakes
can be made what actual muscles are
actually feeling at a variety of time
scales including during the set you know
tension and burn and stuff like that the
pump and perturbation weakness between
sets and then disruption and soreness
after sets and a few days later that all
gives you a little bit more information
so if i tell you like hey here's the
best exercise for quads and you do a
bunch of it and it doesn't really check
those boxes and then you do some hack
squats and they fucking annihilate your
legs and i'm like are you pumped and
sore and you're like dude what the fuck
are you gonna ask me that i can't stand
up can you please help me i have to go
to work i can't walk like a lot of bad
things could be said about that exercise
but
uh too little quad stimulus probably
isn't one of them now that's just on the
stimulus side there's also the fatigue
side so given that the exercises
stimulate you pretty well as far as we
can proxy with these do they cause a lot
of joint connective tissue stress if i
if you do skull crushers like this
you're like ow my elbows out my elbows
if i have you switch to do them like
this you're like oh shit my elbows feel
totally fine like one of those is
probably the right answer no matter what
biomechanics says cause if you're going
to grind your joints off your fucking
body no number of physics equations can
make you feel good about that and then
of course
there's the issue of systemic fatigue
and this is where i think uh it's just a
disagreement but i think doug brignol
and his folks there have a pretty good
point some exercises are so fucking
fatiguing and you question like for what
a lot of the exercises he offers aren't
as fatiguing so maybe they're better
trade-off of stimulus to fatigue which
is the stimulus to fatigue ratio right
and that's kind of asking the question
between exercises of two different
stimulus and fatigue ratios
it you know set for set how many sissy
squats do i have to do to get the same
raw stimulus magnitude which is like
tension pump burn etc all hints at that
versus how much fatigue is imposed
versus like full rom hacks or leg
presses so you know if you are curious
about these methods and you start doing
sissy squats like the cable sissy squats
he shows where he holds the cable and
squats all the way up and down you know
you do five of those or sets of those
close to failing my quads are pretty
fucked up how does it compare to like
five sets of hack squats or full range
of motion leg presses if it compares
better and it gives you less fatigue
fucking
do that shit forever but if after five
sets of sissy squats you're like oh yeah
quads are fucked up that's sweet but
after five sets of hack squats your
quads are like balloon animals gonna
burst and everything's right with this
world then gee is someone really gonna
tell you like oh hack squats are
inferior
are they really in my quads sure don't
feel like it and my fatigue is fine etc
etc etc
so
that was disagreement point number three
point number four and these are all sort
of layered individually um
there's a claim that these are the best
exercises for growth uh the instant
retort to that could be how do you know
that and the ultimate way to know that
is to have some really good empirical
data
uh and actually go into the lab and take
you know 20 undergrads here 20
undergrads here one does the best
exercises one group and the other group
does the traditional barbell and machine
movements you see who grows more muscle
at the end equated set for set all of
that sets taken to the same degree
failure so on so forth as far as i've
seen on these particular exercises
there's really no hard data or maybe i'm
missing some on actual growth so okay so
maybe these aren't the best exercise but
maybe they are
then if we don't have direct data and
the proxies say what they say we can
look out into the world and see okay
ecologically who's really doing these
exercises in the real world and how
jacked are they on average now that is
of course has limits
so
we'll talk about the limits in a second
but like you know for example on the
quad front sissy squats are great and
all but squats hack squats and leg
presses have built uh and do currently
build the biggest legs on the planet and
is there a huge advantage in switching
to mostly or only sissy squats maybe but
if if so who's doing it that's really
jacked i'm not sure i know anyone
offhand that's abandoned all the
traditional moves in favor of these uh
top 20 exercises maybe this is something
that's so avant-garde so cutting edge
that in the future everyone's going to
be doing these best exercises and no
one's going to be doing the traditional
moves a lot you know doug's been around
longer than me by a considerable factor
and i've been around a long time and a
lot of candidates for new shit come and
go
gee whiz you know barbell bent rose
stiff legged deadlift squats leg presses
hack squats incline barbell press
incline dumbbell press these movements
have been around for a long time why
because they probably just have a really
big raw stimulus mag because fuck you
just grow a lot of muscle and often many
of these especially done right
their fatigue they impose relative to
how much muscle they grow just isn't
that high they just win and that's why
they're still around now there's a lot
of dog shit still around that sucks and
people do stupid shit like cheating and
stuff still and that doesn't defend it
so this argument doesn't go very far but
it goes far enough to say like wow we're
really claiming these are the best
exercises and
i don't think doug brignall does this a
lot as far as who i read but some of the
folks that follows work and i'm not
judging him by the people that follow
his work uh
people follow my work a lot of times say
completely insane shit like dr mike said
i'm like what the fuck i never said that
but some of these folks following the
work are like well you know like any
anyone who does traditional exercise now
is a fucking idiot i had a guy on my
instagram be like well you just don't
know physics and i'm like
i guess i don't i'm not sufficiently
intelligent to figure out what's going
on i can't even render an opinion on
this right so a lot of times there's a
lot of exaggerating going on you would
think like man based on that degree of
confidence this must be these jack big
rainy looking motherfuckers all over the
place being like duh but then you look
at like who's actually doing the stuff
and they're not so impressive yet which
is not a distraction but it really isn't
evidence to that point but remember uh
you know extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence just sort of
basic i guess epistemology and uh you
know if you're seeing anyone this really
is the best not just like hey just try
the shit i think it probably works uh if
you're saying these are the best and
everything else sucks it's a cool thing
to say for marketing for sure but if you
really do mean that then you're going to
have to have some really impressive
evidence and so far i haven't seen it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist but
i guess i'm appealing to ignorance here
so
at the end of the day
this is a very big problem if you try
these exercises
that are recommended and they don't give
you as good of a stimulus with a good of
a trade-off of fatigue
uh versus the supposedly poor choices
like you you know you've done hack
squats and leg process and high bar
squats you try to do the 60 squats you
really give it some time and you're just
like
and then and then what like are you
doing them wrong is it the biomechanics
doesn't apply to everyone
and that's what leads to sort of
disagreement number five is i think
exercise choice is massively individual
that doesn't mean it's entirely
individual
i don't think there's a best exercise
there is a spectrum for any individual
anymore any one time
i think maybe everyone has like a top
three to five moves for any muscle group
that are really just the fucking best
right like for me for back for example
deficit barbell bent row
uh free or assisted pull-up and like
cable
what's the name uh was i think called
lack prayer right the straight arm lat
extension thing like those three and
forget the lap pair just those two free
assistant pull-up or
free or sister pull-up barbell bent row
they're just so fucking good that
anytime i come into a gym and i'm
traveling i need to train back if i get
the setup for either one of those fuck
everything else i'm doing those shits
unless they're really stale burnt out
for me they're just like really my core
they work super well now
there's probably about 10 maybe 15
really awesome back exercises with
slight derivatives making up a bigger
fraction
and
maybe like some people
their top five is the same as my top
five out of that top 10 or 15 and some
people's top five are different than
mine but there's probably like 10 of the
best exercises for every muscle group
not like two or three because like i
used to think this kind of stuff back in
the day and i was like
barbell squats are superior for everyone
because they were my best exercise for
quads and still are one of the best
and then i met people that weren't
shaped like me and people's muscles were
shaped differently people different
training histories and limitations
and for them hack squats just did a
better job on everything quad related
than high bar squats or leg presses or
even like more upright walking lunges or
some other exercise i'd be like i don't
i don't i don't like that exercise but
if it's checking the boxes of stimulus
for that person and really on not
checking the boxes for fatigue how can
you say it's a bad exercise but it's
clearly just doing a really really good
job for them right
so
that being said your best
might change right your top five can
rotate to number one go into number five
and vice versa just based on things like
stainless like yeah deficit bent rows
are the best back exercise for me for
overall back development that and
pull-ups or something but like for a few
months and then i get fucking sick and
tired of them and then machine rows are
actually better for at least a small
amount of time possibly for a while when
someone says oh my god why are you doing
machines and not barbells i'm like well
you know you know how many it's just
like food it is your pasta your favorite
food sure if you eat it like for 15 days
in a row every meal pasta is still your
favorite food probably not i know
someone's going to comment the comments
yes i love pasta congratulations but you
know at some point rice looks better
just because it's not pasta right so
when the human body tends to adapt to
things and your positive adaptations as
well as negative so sometimes if you're
sticking to this very core group of
these are the best exercises and you
can't do anything else you're not
sticking exercises that get stale on you
and and they end up not being optimal
and variation is a really really good
thing
it can also exercise effect can change
with training phase like sometimes
exercises that are really awesome for
you and a fat loss training cycle when
you're gaining weight you might get some
like lower back pumps or something
because you're a fat fuck and then all
of a sudden bent rows don't work all
that well or sometimes like you know you
do like like really tight belted high
bar squats but like you you get to be a
little heavier and this works drugs or
drug free you start running out of
breath on the squats because you're like
i'm just too fat to fucking do these
squats for any meaningful number of reps
i got to do more leg extensions leg
presses hack squats so that i actually
push my quads instead of my lungs so it
changes based on training phase based on
technique you could think hey you know
leg presses are no good for me someone
you watch our leg press technique video
and you're like oh my fucking god this
is the greatest fucking exercise ever or
moralistically like wow this is a lot
better and now it's one of my candidates
for the top five right so this idea that
exercises are either
the best or everything but is probably
not true it's probably more of a
spectrum that spectrum varies between
individuals and even within individuals
over time super super important point so
take home points from all this
i think that the idea that just a few
exercises can be the best exercises for
everyone is very likely false i i just
think that's a full stop probably wrong
however
if uh you see someone taking a unique
take on some movements or just movements
you've never tried before
that can give you some great new
alternatives to try
which actually might work
when you're trying them you to try them
full out which means
find the individualized technique that
you work best with so if you try the 60
squat cable attachment thing put your
feet somewhere comfy that you could
really produce some force make sure to
get a good grip or use some versa grips
or something so your grip's not limiting
etc etc give it the best chance you can
and then slowly over the few weeks add
sets and reps as needed and load but
also make sure your
mind muscle connection and intensity is
being increased so the first time you
try and exercise you're like i don't
know it gets wonky i'm kind of off
balance i felt like i was trying but who
knows the next time you're more used to
it push it a little harder squeeze a
little more and then it can actually be
potentially a really good exercise while
you're doing that over probably a
mesocycle so like you know four to eight
sessions 48 weeks in a row you can start
to examine and get a feel for the
stimulus to fatigue ratio because the
same as the fatigue ratio of a lot of
exercises blows dick when you first
start them because you don't fucking
know what you're doing you're barely
even doing it right as you practice them
and really sort of wiggle into okay this
is how i do the dumbbell press then
after a few weeks you can really give a
good quality assessment to okay what
really is the stimulus to fatigue ratio
of this exercise compared to the others
and you can rank it as like wow this is
fucking sweet i'm gonna use this for the
next few months and or put it in my bag
of tricks to use when i need it or
you're like this is fine and if i'm
really out of variance that normally i
use or if i'm on the road there's not a
lot of machines i can use it's not the
greatest thing ever or you could be like
that fucking blows i
eight fucking weeks of my life i'll
never get back it just hurt my fucking
shoulders to do this the stupidest thing
i've ever done maybe i'll come back to
it years later try it again with some
other technique maybe i had an expert
really look at my form maybe i'm doing
something wrong uh but for now i'm just
throwing that exercise away into the bin
of like forgotten exercise like you know
like an elephant graveyard from lion
king which was like a very scary scene
for me when i saw it at age 10. in any
case
awesome result would be if you went out
and threw some money at uh doug brignol
and his folks maybe bought one of his
programs
gave it a shot to some of the exercises
and maybe you'll keep some uh that
you'll really really like and it'll be
super effective and if not uh no big
deal and not not much lost in your case
and then you don't have to worry about
whether you're missing out on stuff
i will say lastly
don't be surprised if after you've tried
a bunch of new stuff that the old basic
barbell and machine compounds and
isolations still fucking really good man
and i know there's this temptation to be
hardcore about the shit and be like fuck
barbell compounds bro it's not a fucking
barbell i can't fucking do this i don't
even bother like barbell curls brother
you want biceps none of that fucking
machine bullshit like i get it it's
stupid bro nonsense
so some of that we just shot up bros but
some of it's like this shit just fucking
works sometimes and if it works but
somebody says it's biomechanically
suboptimal as long as you're getting
good tension pump burn etc as long as
over time you seem to be adding muscle
and your joints aren't hurting i'd say
keep doing it try some new stuff here
and there if it seems to work better
great keep it in and if not don't worry
about them folks follow up with some
questions i'm sure i'll get to answer
some below
if you're really upset i'm upset too
aren't we all just upset god damn it i
wish this world was a better place in
any case see you next time
you
