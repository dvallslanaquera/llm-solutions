oh bonus round slow if you're gonna do
it do it right one more one more one
more one more don't go anywhere
[Music]
hey folks I'm Dr Mike this is Jared
feather ifb Pro and this here is Blake
Blake is 10 weeks out of the Jay Cutler
classic bodybuilding competition and a
few more weeks after that out from
probably the USA's in July and he
already has arms that are quite large
but this morning he looked at his arms
in the mirror and he thought yeah this
is not big enough I'm gonna call Jared
if you guys going to call Mike we're
gonna get in here again Scott the video
guy to get an RP video of Blake's arms
being physically torn from his body
through weights you in for it oh yeah my
man Jared what do you think it's gonna
be good he's uh like I said already
gigantic arms he's going to show us how
to train arms to be honest today
23 years old I was 23 years old back in
1866. folks let's get it started
Let's uh lock it out really quick up top
and then as your elbows
try to keep an end yeah you want to bend
them towards your hips yep keep them in
yep and just touch your chin okay
oh shit yeah slow on the way down and
quick on the way up all right Blake is
starting out with triceps then we're
gonna do some biceps and surprises the
biceps it's gonna be a giant arm vest
first exercise is the barbell spell
Crusher the cues here to keep the elbows
flush into your body
to come down with your elbows traveling
down towards your hips as you bend not
this way this way is totally cool but my
experience causes elbow pain a bit more
frequently than bending the elbows in is
going to be in close tight slow on the
way down and with his arm length and
ratio looks like his chin is a great
portion of his body to touch and then
come back slow on the way down and come
back we're gonna do multiple sets and
then we're gonna after another exercise
let's get to it
the way we warmed up was like the bar
for 12. 95 pounds for eight 115 for
three
three to four reps there that's a really
good progression forming up normal rest
time between all the warm-ups and Blake
has already done 115 for three we know
it's a good weight we know he can handle
it now he's gonna do it for sets of well
10 to 15 to the primary work sets normal
rest time in between all of these
yes there is a time for all kinds of
drop shot supers Etc don't worry we'll
get to that later in the workout but the
first exercises generally should be
moderate repetition range nice and heavy
because you are fresh enough to impose
that much tension through your muscles
later when you're not fresh you can do
all the metabolites
speaking of which let's get started yes
a couple more I'm right here with you
but those elbows
push push push
I'm weak bro
I have a death called crusher's unlocked
it's a weird exercise yes 115 pounds per
set of eight we want a little bit more
repetition so we are going to do 95
pounds for the remaining three sets
[Music]
[Music]
push up and forward push
yes
elbows in
slow control that shit
go go
fast
oh
what was that
is that eight I think I ate again
it's fastest rich man of all time
it was a big ass triceps I must tell you
you think so they're nonsensical and I
have big triceps all right well thanks
thanks bro
push that way
yes
slow control
push good one more
slow control
yes yes Blake you are a fucking god
let's do this shit
push it oh go oh that's it amazing
amazing amazing
oh
115 for a set of eight
95 for a set of eight
95 percent of six this is a fast twitch
boy he's getting tired real quick so we
have to accommodate
we are going to reduce the load even
further to get him back into that rep
range of our targeting which is sets of
10 to 15. hopefully you'll get at least
10 here with 65 pounds that'll be set
for last set and then we move on to the
next tricep exercise you got to make
sure you stay in that rep range you
decided now could you go all the way
down to sets of five totally but if you
want to be on a certain rep range
because you want a certain stimulus to
fatigue ratio you find exists while in
that rep range yes you have to reduce
the load and he's resting in normal time
these are not drop sets when the
camera's off we're here two or three
minutes and it's just big muscles fast
twitch crazy asshole muscles like this
you get tired real fast we have to
accommodate
[Music]
probably somebody showed up to fucking
work today huh let's go oh yeah
my man
elbows in
probably in
come on Blake one more go come on
[Music]
fuck yeah
holy shit hey hit a front uh get a most
most muscular that's not a good shit bro
foreign
fuck happened to that guy's triceps man
[Music]
yep false grip false grip so thumbs
thumbs like this yep
this guy's built for it okay so we want
you to slowly descend just like Skull
Crushers as deep as you can Ultra
fucking crazy stretch right there I need
to put this thing lower yes beautiful
that's exactly what we wanted all right
these are going to be superseted after
your overnight extensions keep your butt
up
look forward yes just like that yep yep
look forward
sink in down with your elbows flush to
your sides as deep as you can go
and up
and slow and pause and Up full lockout
slow and pause
and up
great stop
oh it's gonna be fun very fun very fun I
may ask you at some point if you can't
do enough reps regular to drop to your
knees which I'm sure you start your day
job that's all blowjob joke
Blake is big and strong he's technical
he's well connected with his muscles he
knows what to do he's super coachable
and cubable which means he's only gonna
get two of each exercise two triceps two
biceps this is realistic he's actually a
bodybuild competitor we're not here to
try to fry his muscles completely off
his body pointlessly leading to more
damage than growth so I'm gonna do
another four sets this time it's gonna
be superset style overhead cable tricep
extensions superset two deficit push-ups
from dumbbells this is gonna
frig frick I'm trying to swear less
maybe fuck that's right his triceps big
time they're gonna be useless and then
we move on to the buys for the guys
sets of 10 to 20 hopefully on the
overhead extension sets of at least five
on the push-up if it doesn't work if
he's too fucked up we have him go to his
knees many of you are familiar with that
so from your day jobs
but in all honesty it's a great leverage
to get more reps out watch first
technique watch how diligent he is at
keeping his elbows in and how slowly he
enters in to that massive tricep stretch
with his massive triceps lots of amazing
tips to pick up from this video don't
ever completely mock somebody's
technique or completely copy it but damn
this is fucking close
slow
deep one more
go oh yes again slow
Steve you got one more Blake let's
fucking get after it
go go go go go go go go go go go go
slow
together but don't slow slow slow
pause rack go go go go go go go go right
into push-ups
oh
[Music]
oh shit yeah full lockouts motherfucker
let's go go lock out yes down slow
let's go let's go there's children you
don't fucking swear
good one more deep deep
press out
go lock
that's it oh yeah oh boy
ah
how do you usually train your arms I
just feel like try sauce alternate tries
to buys okay I honestly do like four
exercises for each or four for total
four for each well today you're only
gonna do eight sets total for each of
them but we will you won't need much
more no I'm fucking actually it's like
toast bro yeah your tricep set two more
sets and they're already done so
everything everything now is overkill
yeah lean into the paint it's not going
anywhere you are here to collect the
fucking pain
the pain means growth yes one more I was
looking back I had been sauce and back
strong lock out
yes as if another one more let's go yeah

dude that's good let's give the fucking
man folks
people ask
what does it take to get on the RP
channel to train with Dr Mike and Jared
and stuff like that or what are you guys
looking for we're looking for two things
have good technique and fucking try yeah
he's asked big arms and all that shit he
those first two things are gonna take
his big arms and make them fucking
bigger than ever because that's what it
takes great technique he never broke
down his technique and he tried hard
enough to not be able to push himself up
off the ground I think it's time for
biceps hey guys I want to take a minute

[Music]
four sets of triceps
done with Skull Crushers
four sets of triceps superset so really
like six effectively sets of triceps
done with the overhead extension
supersets the push-ups
Blake's triceps are done that's
essentially 10 hard ass
basically the failure working sets
that's it lights out bicep time our
first exercise is going to be an easy
bar curl watch for Jared feathers
technique instruction he's going to be
focusing on bringing the elbows in
on opening up the bicep at the bottom
for a Big Stretch and following the
natural arcing motion of the curl
that shit works it's not the only way to
train biceps but it is one of a few very
very effective ways we're going to be
doing sets of
8 to 12 probably here for Blake he seems
like the kind of guy to be into that
sort of shit and then after that we're
going to do another final bicep
exercises four sets here
let's get it done elbow short each other
come on come on one more control chest
up the entire time
good one more come on Blake you gotta
try a little bit today
yes
slow chest up stretch strap
do you count I don't know 10 it is
probably about 10. okay the next three
sets
we are going to ask you to do 10 Reps
for all three sets
bonuses if you fail you can put the bar
down and rest for like 10 whole seconds
or 15 seconds and then go again until
you get to 10 and then you get a full
two minutes rest sound good all right
take your time for the next set we are
no rush push them in every rep needs to
feel like that at the top and if it
doesn't it's not right
from here
I was in
oh
all right that was sick so far so far
yeah four more
down slow
last perfect grip fight those elbows in
the whole time don't lean back too much
fuck the elbows in and then up
as if you're gonna do another slow slow
control
my man do you want a trash can to throw
up into yeah grab me one I don't think
I'm going to it
stop stay upright
advice
come on boys let's get six here man I
was gonna fight it
fight it good small let's do seven and
then rest chest off
[Music]
slow slow
[Music]
let's rest it out and get three nice 15
second long rest and then three good
ones there you go right there elbows in
push him and push him
control
[Music]
all right pick up uses biceps yes sir
slow
oh bonus round slow if you're gonna do
it do it right one more one more one
more one more don't go anywhere let's
get back in the fight one more good one
man no bullshit technique today stand
straight up elbows in perfect fucking
rep oh yes close it up slow as if you're
gonna do another one slow resist resist
resist resist resist resist
oh my God oh my God this shit's good oh
God damn
hilariously we have more biceps left to
do I know I don't know how
we'll figure it out
[Music]
last exercise of the day incline
dumbbell curls
I'm gonna see what he has left we'll see
what kind of set rep scheme plays out
four sets probably
we're gonna Auto regulate the rep to see
where he's comfortable and take him
mildly out of that comfort zone the key
here with this exercise is to stay nice
and upright and to really let your
biceps stretch at the bottom
and then a nice Peak contraction at the
top with a slow eccentric control the
stretch back here the incline curl pulls
the bicep out this way pre-stretching it
it's kind of like the stiff-legged
deadlift pre-stretches your hamstrings
that is something that really really
really hits the bicep in a very special
way and if you haven't tried it in your
program before give it a shot Blake
hasn't sure done these before but he
sure shit hasn't done them like we're
about to do them let's get into it
a couple more couple more couple more
couple more let's get the dumbbells
together let's do 12.
two more right away
yes go go go go go go go go
slow slow get ready for this next one
[Music]
yes
slow slow
and wrapped
wow
good you got two extra so only eight on
your next set easy next time okay let's
explain something strange Blake has
arguably 21 inch or bigger muscular arms
how the hell is he only using the 20s on
this exercise I'm sure you've done the
20s at home for a set of ten
what explains this well for first of all
if he was fresh he could have done maybe
the 40s okay different world so he's
really beat up which makes sense another
thing is that muscle architecture the
way the muscle is shaped where it
inserts and originates by a small
fraction of the bone and tons of
neurological factors how much your
nervous system Powers muscle contraction
play a role in strength generation
somebody significantly less jacked
looking in that regard arms wise for
example somebody like Joe Sullivan
way stronger
it doesn't look as strong generally the
bigger your muscles are the stronger you
are there are absolutely exceptions and
a huge spectrum of variables so Blake
actually got really lucky he doesn't
need to beat the shit out of his joints
to get incredible workout for his
muscles which brings me to our next
Point let's do the next step
all the way up all the way up yes seven
all the way down slow
ah hey come on boy
all the way up
all the way up all the way up
slow as if another slow slow slow slow
slow slow
and wrap
oh
that is the workout
what'd you think
it's good yeah yeah
no way are your arm workouts typically
this intense
yeah I train my arms hard but not the
way you understand them okay not like
the like super concentrate like yes
we're like moving some shit down
bodybuilder like okay you know right you
know yeah hopefully you know you're well
on your way to being bigger but less
dumb like all of us I will definitely
incorporate some of this into my
training now hell yeah Excellence
excellent dude it was a pleasure Jared
any thoughts any tips for the people at
home who bought 21 in charms but are not
either
Armenians on your arm sessions you're
gonna have 21 inch arms it's ridiculous
yeah I haven't done five sets ago
yeah this is intense perseverance folks
good technique and a shitload of effort
wherever your genetics are that'll mix
in it'll give you the best possible
results until next time see you next
time
