all right folks so fun little video
but this is me actually training i
decided to modify my training just a
little bit in context
i'll be doing more volume and i've done
another exercise and we'll do some
others to make up for this but today
we're going to do a little bit of
learning about failure okay
failure comes in all kinds of forms
there's eccentric failure concentric
failure technical failure
technical failure is when you can no
longer do another repetition
with good technique or more specifically
when you attempt to do a repetition with
perfect technique
and fail if you grind the technique a
little bit and
get twerky and don't do good technique
that's not technical failure if you hit
failure after your technique sucks
already
that's something else that's more better
appropriate as uh
absolute failure okay so we're only
doing technical failure here in this
video but we're gonna do
three different sets these are real
world sets
because technical failure has a couple
of sub categories
specifically on the degree of
psychological arousal so
first type of failure is what you
commonly see in folks that aren't used
to the gym
newbies and some individuals that just
don't have
kind of a psychology of really pushing
themselves maybe genetically they do
but no one's ever sort of rooted them
into using it
for them failure or in this video what
i'm going to be demonstrating is zero
rar because we're doing a
sort of squat exercise i'm not getting
pinned in this fucking machine and dying
zero reps in reserve means i don't think
i'll be able to do another rep with good
technique
but if i'm sort of this group one type
of failure essentially people here fail
roughly
when the exercise gets pretty hard and
starts to really push on them
they kind of go i'm working pretty hard
i think i might have one more they kind
of get a little scared a little reserved
and then they only get a certain number
of reps this is not the best way to
train
there is a better way to go to failure
that i'll demonstrate in the next step
so let's get to it i'm going to
demonstrate
watch my rep speed watch my technique
watch my facial expressions and grunting
try to keep it as real as possible type
one failure of like
nothing too impressive and i could be
working harder here we go
[Music]
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
so that was it zero ir
where because i'm just not trying that
hard i may think it's zero rer
but really there's a whole not a lot of
effort going on and a lot of times
people don't know this
it's not like they're slacking sometimes
they are but
this is to generate slack is a whole
different discussion this type of
close to failure training is to
essentially
sort of show to you guys that some
people are very genuine they do
think they're very close to fail but
there's not a lot of arousal there's not
a lot of focus
to take someone from this kind of
failure push them into the more correct
one
take some nodding some prodding some
pushing if you're a personal trainer or
training partner or coach
when you see someone chronically getting
to this kind of failure
tell them listen let me know when you
think you're close to fail
they'll let you know and then right when
they almost finish that last rep
you get in their face and you say hey
you have one more let's go
and they usually are too frightened to
know what the hell's going on and they
figure like i could argue with this guy
i could rack and argue
what could you do in the rep they do it
and it works and you go one more
and you do it now another one and do it
again so now i got six reps on that side
i would have done eight if someone was
in my face stop there
stop there that's good enough next time
they come into the gym with you
maybe the time after that push them a
little further
maybe to nine reps maybe to ten
eventually
they're going to get into a place where
short of going nuts
they're actually reaching very close to
fail that's where most training happens
when coach greg
talks about most people don't train hard
enough he's got a point there because a
lot of people i don't know if it's most
a ton of people stop through for me was
about the six reps
tough shit is definitely pushing back
reps are slowing down but goddammit if i
focused i could get some more
this next set will be a focus set i'm
going to get my mind right
i'm not losing my mind i'm not going to
dark places with childhood trauma
but i'm expressing my best abilities in
a focused regimented manner
and i'm really going to push myself this
is the kind of failure
you want to reach close to and actually
get the best results
let's get it and let's see how many reps
i get
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
he's
[Music]
[Music]
ah
so
that was nine or ten
nine or ten way more than six
definitely hit the spot more
one thing you guys might notice is my
rep speed was much more consistent
because i was trying from rep one only
when i started to hit my physical limits
did the last rep really start to slow
down on me
with the first set of six the easy one
you notice the last three reps weren't
that fast
because a lot of people who train like
that they sort of feel the burden of the
load
and they accept it psychologically they
say oh you know this feels heavy
am i really so interested in trying to
move it a lot no
so they'll let it slow them down a very
focused person
will proceed until physiology slows them
down
and that's like oh one rep in reserve
zero reps in reserve very tough
next so real quick
that second type of failure we just did
or close to failure
that is how you should train pretty much
all the time
beginners can train with the first type
as they grow into intermediates
they should progress into that second
type
intermediates should be training that
hard or harder
but there is another level we're going
to go to
on this sounds like i'm narrating a
dragon ball z ascension
episode this level
is one in which you
uncork something inside yourself
that you normally keep court than civil
society
some of you have it some of you don't
a lot of it is to do with not so
pleasant memories or ideas
and you go to a place where you dip into
a part of your
animalistic rage prone psychology
that results in a few things one a
massive increase in neural drive
two a massive increase in performance
three a massive increase in stimulus per
set
but unfortunately two other things an
unreal amount of fatigue
and a pretty decent enhancement of the
risk of injury
should you train like this this third
way
all the time no you have two choices
as a hypertrophy trainee you can either
train like this never
or maybe once a mesocycle at most on
your final week when you're tired you're
beat up you're sore
you may go at least somewhat into this
dark place
to take out those few reps mind you all
of the studies on failure training
most of the people don't go to the dark
place they go
sometimes to place number one sometimes
to place number two
often number two so they're good they're
reliable and thus you can count on them
to structure your training so when
people say
three reps in reserve is really good so
it was two so is one so zero
mostly we're talking about that type two
kind of failure
this type three close to failure very
not studied
and i would bet it causes so much
fatigue that regular training with it is
not productive
because the fatigue quickly escalates
and you can't perform anymore
it's mentally very draining which would
be okay if it was worth it but it's
probably not
but at the end of a mesocycle if you're
locked in if your technique is good and
you never compromise
you can lock in and go to your special
place now for me my special place
some kind of interesting childhood shit
and for some reason
because i'm russian and i spent up to
year seven in russia
the russian language specifically gets
something going in some kind of
primordial way
so i will be talking to myself in
russian very likely so enjoy that shit
remember i got like nine or ten reps in
the other one we'll we'll post them
below what i actually got i can't count
we'll see how many i got this one let's
give it a shot
still here
[Music]
so
[Music]
raspberry
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hmm
ah well that was fun
so got six reps
sealing the weight i got ten reps
when uh i was focused and with psychotic
childhood memories
i got me 15. definitely a difference
and i mean i kind of couldn't use my
legs right after
you'll notice i'm sitting now so that
shit is all wobbly it feels weird
that is a hard set
i had to train like that all the time
i'd lower my volume a lot
but i don't think it would be worth it
from a stimulus to fatigue ratio
perspective
every now and again great idea all the
time not so much
so mostly if you work with beginners
you want to level them up into that
second style
focused training if you're in that
second style you're golden
every now and again explore a little bit
into that third
to see if you're being realistic with
your second
without a whole lot extra arousal you
can get two or three reps
shit then you know you could be training
a little harder
without a trying to browse and maybe
at the end of every muscle cycle when
you're really feeling in the dumps
turn it up for at least a set or two go
to that nasty childhood place maybe
you have i definitely do charlie for
sure has
jared's made of that shit um and it's
cool and it works
but it's not something you do all the
time give that some thought
i'm gonna go finish my workout see you
next time
[Music]
you
