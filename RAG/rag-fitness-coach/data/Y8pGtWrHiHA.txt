hey youtube what's going on i'm dr mike
israel this is jared feather he's an ifb
pro i'm an ifbb no i get it cause i'm
broke
but what i do have is incredible fashion
white
red and blue we are filming this on the
fourth of july happy birthday america
and the rest of the world also hello
um
do you guys think that on the 4th of
july america's day of independence and
thus birth date that if there's a u.n
meeting that the u.s representative
should bring cupcakes for the rest of
the world leaders yes goody bags yeah
this is video one of a whole bunch of
other videos some of these videos you
will see on the main channel
other videos are
really in-depth insight super focused
training of jared feather peaking for a
show which he's now about a week and a
half out from
and that means he's really big and lean
and looks all weird and if you're into
that sort of thing you're in a bunch of
vlog-like science talk about getting
super peaked and ready for a show when
you like mr jared feather
you either are already one of our
subscribed members or you can go get
yourself a hit on that little join
button right there just below your
screen and join up it's super cheap and
you get to see jared maybe pretty close
to naked even it's not only fans hey but
it's close anybody can get a little
naked in this a little naked in this one
too mostly naked in the other in the
subscription yes
i am
at the middle of my peak massing times
so i weigh about 250. and uh jared you
weigh about
223. 223 but you're going to realize
that jared has a lot more muscle than me
because he's fucking enormous push
training
chest
triceps
a little bit of front delt
let's get it popping
[Music]
first exercise today
low incline cambered bench why a low
incline well doing a high incline camera
bench uh pretty difficult probably not
gonna be able to touch your chest
this allows us to get a little more
range of motion
um
i would mean mike actually discussed
this beforehand but i was doing a camera
bar bench
my previous message cycle
i've only done it once this meso because
i was a little worried about the extra
stretch but keeping this in the higher
rep range doing 15 to 20 reps of the
extra stretch and limiting the load on
the bar is actually probably better for
me right now
so i'll be going pretty light today
15-20 rep range for me mike is doing the
same yeah 15-20 inch mic also so
let's start
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
nice
we're doing the
what i would call vertical emphasis
today generally i do my horizontal
emphasis first but since it's pushed
it's not a big deal because there's not
too many
there aren't really any many interfering
muscle muscles to use for tomorrow so if
i was doing pull today i wouldn't do my
horizontal pulling and then my
hamstrings tomorrow because that's a lot
of erector
so today i just flipped them so me and
mike can train together because we have
very similar exercises for this day
so incline push emphasis um mike's gonna
do triceps right now as well when he's
doing triceps i'm going to do my flies
because i like to split my triceps up in
the pm
for me i think um
during prep people always ask me do you
also do pm sessions
and the answer is yes i think it's
actually better to do pm sessions during
my prep because i'm super fucking tired
and fatigued uh getting a shitload of
training volume into one session is kind
of difficult so splitting them up is
awesome
yeah i might not have a lot of energy
later but i also i'm only gonna have
like six seven sets later so it's not a
big deal for me
a lot of people like to push their shit
together when they're in prep and only
do one a day which is also fine i just
like it better this way for me it feels
really good
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
there you go
[Music]
[Music]
yep
fuck
i still have intracarbs is this close to
show
oh i always talk shit on like low high
days
that's only because i train six days a
week two times a day for four days of
those
um so when i mask my carbs are actually
still high
on the off days but when i dye it down
i actually reduce the carbs and up the
fats
on sundays when i'm just working i don't
really do too much activity so
yesterday was a low day for me
but it's not too difficult
[Music]
[Music]
that's what everyone in england sounds
like
all the time hey reporter
you're the main fucking show
i'm a backup dancer
no no you're the you're the show ready
this looks really good
why are these guys dancing on video two
weeks out they're supposed to be fucking
training back when i was eight back when
we fucking trained
we drank mike menser's blood in between
sets bro
we tattoo dory nick's face on our face
remember that
[Music]
i'm doing all my chest volume in the
morning mike is combining his triceps
and chest volume
so i'll be doing flies here michael swap
out the attachment and do
push downs are you doing my reps
fire up match my match push downs for
mike
gonna have a juicy tricep pump
and i'm just gonna be here looking flat
with my titties
[Music]
oh i'm doing 15 to 20 also resets
[Music]
[Music]
i do a little compound isolation
compound sandwich
as mike has discussed on the channel
before for today for my
pushing volume uh generally
like i said earlier that first exercise
is uh
it isn't cambered but i did that at the
beginning of this message cycle and then
i swapped it out so
should be fine that's why i did three
sets gotta tailor the volume to the new
variation that i did
but flies have been in this entire metal
cycle and so i've inclined dumbbell
so the two sets of flies here
after my three sets of cambered and i'm
gonna do three sets of another heavy
compound pushing exercise to really cap
off the chest
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
and i'm done
do you want to be a beach fuck boy you
get a beach fuck boy physique for five
easy payments of 9.99 you get the abs
you get the packs the arms that say
you're a girl is mine the cavs that can
kick sand into a nerd's feet five times
faster than ever before and the mohawk
that says i'm a fucking douchebag hey
credit card number right in the
description
that's really good jared you kept her
cool
[Music]
i've done all kinds of presses before
i've done declines flat press dennis
james
simultaneous press fly i've done high
incline low incline
dumbbell press barbell press football
bar press
machine press
cambered pass
but today
forrest gump is going to do the incline
press
because of
because it's not a movement that's
controlled on both ends it doesn't
you need your triceps to have a
requisite
force generation because that just did
them on the
press down they're the limiting factor
and that's why they're gonna get the
stimulus
lieutenant jared
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
uh
dr mike
you ask
why so few sets
because
how many sets you do it's based on
your work capacity and your ability to
recover
in your previous exposure
if you haven't been training with a ton
of volume
you got to go up really slow
so you don't overdo it
and get beyond your recovery capacity
or recovery ability rather so
yeah
jared and i could do four sets of
everything
but we're used to
getting really great stimulus because of
our technique
and because of our strength and training
experience we get a great stimulus from
just a few sets
if we arbitrarily did more
we just get really sore really damage
talking a lot on time for the next
workout
needlessly risk injury and probably on
the net balance
gain no muscle at all because of the
damage costing the growth
so that's why we just do
a few sets
funny enough
on our more volume tolerant body parts
muscle groups like back we'll do
12 steps in a workout someone's like
isn't that too much
it's individual
based on your own responses
more you know
[Music]
[Music]
so jared
[Applause]
god
[Music]
so we're done with the workout
three movements for each all chest for
jared
chest and triceps for me
jared's looking
captain america-esque
i'm looking like a 38 year old bald
jewish man
with the usa sure huh oh yeah america's
great it's got freedoms
anyway
jokes at the expense of my ethnicity
uh although i hate that expense like
nobody's paying anything
jokes are funny make jokes
in any case if you guys want more of
these videos a bunch of them will come
out on the normal channel if you want
more extramore
possibly jared's private parts more
you sign up for the uh subscription
for the membership area
little join button blue right hand
corner of your screen also now available
on cellular telephones i think yes so
don't wait
record this on your tape deck
call mom and dad on a landline telephone
have them record set your video cassette
recorder to record
i mean i never my family was never
wealthy enough to afford that system
yeah friends would do that friends would
do that wow you guys have this on video
yeah and when people could tivo their
shit that was really cool but that was
the predecessor to the digital
revolution
