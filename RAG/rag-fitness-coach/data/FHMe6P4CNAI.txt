oh my goodness it's good to be back dr
james dr mike
weekly webinar how's it going it's going
well there's some pretty good questions
here today
and i am over the moon excited to get
into them that's good i'm ready for
questions too i've been doing nothing
but rural shit the last few days
hey fucking my fucking well pump went
out so we've been without water for like
two days
so i've been like having to fill up a
big bucket every time i take a dump so
it will flush
uh i've been chainsawed i took down so
many trees my neighbor came down with
this tractor and i
showed me how to fell trees was pretty
fun wow
are you uh is it satisfying following a
tree
it is until you realize that you have
like thousands of
pounds of wood to now chop even further
with the chainsaw and then split later
so like
sure you know if you have like 100 foot
tree you got to cut it into like 15 inch
sections and then it's a lot of work
but it's fun it is good it does it does
feel very masculine and that like i'm
like fizz i'm doing physical labor to
provide for my family so it hits it
ticks that box really well you know
whatever
i'm cutting all this wood and that's
going to keep everyone warm and it's
going to last me through the winter
so that feels good but it is a
lumberjack yeah
so we have water we've got wood i don't
have great internet but otherwise life's
good
yeah somebody made a joke about the
internet already i know i was
the thing that's like he's like oh why
don't we start a go fund me like
it's not a money issue do you think rp
would let me slack if it was just like
pay more for internet this is the best i
got i have two internet service
providers i got
the hughes net which is like the
laughing stock of internet providers and
i got dsl
get out is there anything reliable about
when they're gonna
make the connection for the one no
they just keep lying to us through their
teeth they're like don't worry
next week great
that's what i'd say all right i'm ready
to go
i'm ready all right our first candidate
is king in the north
you took away the extension right so we
should be ranking them similarly
i did
it's like the game of thrones reference
okay so uh you've said a couple of
different things about programming i was
wondering if i could talk about how they
interact
with each other and how you figure out
prioritization given separate
restrictions one is that if you have two
leg
days in a week one should be hamstring
focused and the other quad focused with
the majority of sets being for
focus for the focus muscle which
presumably goes first
quad focus quads and hamstring on leg
day are only an example
this question applies to whatever muscle
or sharing a day consistently
so i don't think we ever said should we
said could
and it's a very good way to do things
but you can have a more symmetrical
routine that works fine
um any more clarifications on that james
that to make sure that we're being
understood correctly on that specific
point the reason
the reason why this comes up is because
the leg muscles overlap so much so it's
harder to really separate them
versus something like chest and back
it's very easy to just have those being
completely distinct from each other for
the most part whereas like
the legs even if you do something like a
squat you're going to have some
hamstrings include activity and you
can't really
necessarily piecemeal those things out
completely separately unless you use
just comp you know isolation movements
which we generally don't think is the
best way to go about your leg training
so we kind of say
yeah it's probably a good idea to bias
towards one or the other because you're
going to overlap a little bit every time
but you could do it more symmetrically
especially if you use more isolation
that's for sure and then he says the
other one is that you should train in
the heavier end of the range in the
first half of the week
and higher rep in the second half again
not not should but could
um but it's totally the spirit of the
question is on the money
so if one of your leg days in the first
half and the others in the second half
you have to prioritize heavier sets for
one muscle group and higher ups for the
other correct if i'm missing something
let me know otherwise how do you decide
which should get which slot
how often should an intermediate rotate
them or meso or between blocks
edit it's been suggested i should
clarify that this could mean that my
second
leg days in the hamstring squats example
of six days
since my last rest day so i'm concerned
about
systemic fatigue trying to do heavy sets
with either quads or hamstrings on day
six
we're trying to do heavy quads and
hamstring work on the same day also
really sucks well so do high reps it all
sucks
um so how do you best make the
deprioritized one get a good enough
session
somewhere and how often do you recommend
rotating if
both are similar actual priorities so
first you can just 50 50 it and you
don't have to rotate anything
um but if you want to rotate then what
you can do
is for example there's many ways to do
this
monday is heavy hamstrings first
lighter quads second thursday is heavy
quads first
lighter hamstrings second just train
like that
tonight you'll notice that hamstrings
are follow the light to heavy
progression but within the week
quads followed a heavy to light
progression that's not really so
important
you just don't want to have the um
heavy training be right after a ton of
high rep training
so if your quads are trained light after
hamstrings with a slightly lower volume
they're not going to be super damaged or
fatigued by the time you go to your
heavy quads first so there's no real
interaction there so that kind of solves
that problem
how often do you rotate them uh usually
you know there's a couple options but
every meso is probably a little too
frequently
but we would say but it's uh staleness
uh is we should probably
sort of dictate that like if you know
your quad training gets stale because
it's always been
a second fiddle and your hamstring
training is being super great but he
sort of milked out all the games you can
over several mesos then it's time to
switch it around um and or when you feel
that you are ready psychologically and
physique wise
to switch uh to the rotation um
i think ideally if you have an even
priority
every two or three mesos is a good time
to rotate uh if you want to develop both
of them equally
uh and you know that basically is a
training block so your your question of
between blocks is probably something
like the right answer for many people
so you'll have a block where you do
you're really focusing a little bit more
on hamstrings than quads
and then you'll have a whole block where
it's the other way around i think that's
a real good way to go about it gives you
multiple sequential mesocycles
of accumulated progress before you flip
the script and it lets you figure out a
lot of stuff about how to train them
best
to learn for later if you do just one
mezzo at a time sometimes you don't
learn a whole lot
james is frozen um
i did have a couple points if it's not
too late yeah yeah yeah i mean if
scott scott can splice those yeah sure
yeah for sure um
yeah so a couple other things in
addition to what dr mike said although i
missed the second half of what he said
so probably already might have gotten to
this
one thing you can also do is just
prioritization if you are
really focusing more on quads and
hamstrings it's probably not a bad idea
to just toss them in the first slot
during the week when you're the most
recovered that's just an easy
fix another thing to look at is um
if systemic spillover on some of those
movements that you might have throughout
the rest of the week and how much you
actually
how much preparedness you need to
actually execute some of those muscle
groups so for example
um you might find that you can do your
heavy squats without much fuss as long
as you're feeling okay for
the day whereas something like a heavy
stiff leg a deadlift or any kind of
deadlift variation you might have to be
pretty
fresh in order to hit that properly
likewise
you might find if you're somebody who's
built like myself
doing something like a stiff-legged
deadlift has a massive spillover effect
on the rest of the week and then you
find that
tends to crush everything else
downstream just because it's just
you're built you have good anthropometry
for some lift so when you lift them
heavy you do a lot and then it
causes a lot of fatigue and the next day
it tends to be rough no matter
what you do so you can kind of look at
things too and say how prepared how much
preparedness do i need to train quads or
chest heavy and then how much is that
going to spill over
into the subsequent sessions during the
week should i maybe put it on the back
end because there's more recovery coming
on the way
or can i put it on the front end without
paying too much downstream consequence
for the rest of the week
things to think about yep
cass j is our next question asker got it
all right he says how helpful is
exercise specificity when it comes to
hypertrophy training as in doing barbell
bench press variation close grip one day
normal grip paused another day
to not overuse one movement but to still
specify it enough for a better overload
carryover
like power lifters do this question so
much
is it sort of is like power lifters do
to get stronger in one movement
three times or two x a week instead of
one x per week given the specificity
make you stronger a certain movement
faster which means more progressive
overload it doesn't mean more
progressive
it absolutely doesn't um you just get
stronger faster
yeah cars i think you're missing
yeah i think you're framing some of your
questions a little bit strangely so
maybe go back and kind of look at what
some of those principles actually
entail for sure well this is a pretty
common um
i've got so far to say myth or
misunderstanding um
progressive overload over the longer
term in the short term there are ways to
enhance it
in the longer term progressive overload
is more a result of what you're doing
rather than something you cause so if
you know if there's a way to get
stronger faster that doesn't mean it's
going to make you bigger faster
in hypertrophy training the reason you
get stronger
that really we want is because you're
getting bigger so as long as you're
getting bigger that strength will just
reveal itself
and remember having a good workout is
possible no matter what strength you are
if you just train close to failure and
you do multiple sets you're going to get
the best workout anyway
if it your nervous system is really
really advanced
and your leverages are excellent and
your technique is amazing and you can do
500 for you know 550 in a squat versus
450
um that doesn't mean that that's going
to grow much more muscle
and certainly not much enough muscle to
offset the um
the uh fatigue and connective tissue
stuff so for example like
you could say okay well how do i
overload and exercise more well so low
bar squats allow me to use more weight
and because my technique on low bar
squats isn't that amazing as i progress
in lower squats weeks week to week my
technique starts to get better better
better fast
it allows me to really add weight to the
bar which is good but remember a really
good bodybuilder will tell you and
completely correct that weight on the
bar is one thing that you definitely
want to look at but it's not the end all
be
all is that are you creating the high
forces close to failure in the target
muscle
sticking to high bar squats and going
super deep and doing a controlled
eccentric may actually create just as
much force on
the target muscle but because you don't
get to use other muscles it
doesn't have an overall higher load on
the bar
so if you do bench press three times a
week versus once a week
and your bench press strength improves
faster it is almost entirely because of
neural factors like your nervous system
just gets really really good at benching
which is cool but if you just train the
chest hard
with pretty much any exercise it gets
roughly the same hypertrophic stimulus
now
we do want to conserve some movements we
don't want to use everything all the
time
because then we run out of good
variations if you use everything you
know in one week what do you do in the
next mesocycle so it's probably good
to use like a couple of you know similar
lifts like bench press twice a week do
incline twice a week
and then uh you know maybe each one is a
different rep range
and then all of a sudden you're getting
a really great mix of variation and
specificity at the same time but
specificity and a perturbed training
really pretty close to boils down to are
you training the target muscle hard
enough times a week and if that's the
specificity and
uh oh the exercise specifically or you
know are you getting much better at
dumbbell
you know curls uh because you're just
training them once a week versus
twice a week that's just neural
adaptations if you have a dumbbell curl
contest coming up that's pertinent if
you don't
then it's not and it's one thing you'll
notice like really really high level
bodybuilders will do barbell inclines
they'll do like 405 for sets of eight
and you're like holy shit that's amazing
right but there's tons of power lifters
like
good fractions smaller that can do that
they're like how can they do that being
that small well because of neural
efficiency because they practice the
lift better
more often uh incline you know incline
the barbell press is something a
bodybuilder might do once a week
whereas a power lifter really focusing
on his incline strength might do it
twice or three times a week
that way for the smaller pecs he has he
can bench more but that's not the point
for strength absolutely for hypertrophy
it's really kind of uh
not really pertinent uh james yeah that
was really good a couple other things to
think about too is um
when you dip into the same movement a
lot like that so if you're using a lot
of just
bench or something very close to that
like bench and close grip bench
you're going to end up putting a lot of
wear and tear on those same tissues so
although you gain a lot of efficiency
very quickly you also gain
a lot more wear and tear versus
spreading it out using some other
exercise variations
the other problem you run into and
people are quick to forget about this is
although you might see like rapid
increases in strength
you're gonna start petering out on that
movement a lot faster than if you just
had it maybe in the mix once per week so
that movement will start to go
stale much more quickly when you tend to
rely on it more heavily like using the
same movement two to three times a week
so in that regard
you might be able to just tap out a
slightly higher
total gains from the movement over the
course of a block by not overusing it so
what we kind of would see here is if you
use the same movement a lot
your rate of gains might go up and this
is more of a strength thing right
uh very quickly but then it will plateau
out faster
and fully under a bit
if you use it once per week or you know
something a little bit less
and just done it for a longer period of
time so your total magnitude of gain or
what you could have gotten out of that
movement probably a little bit
marginally more had you not taken the
more rapid approach
yeah and uh just real quick that is
actually uh what can be called a
multiplicative problem
the more you practice a lift the more it
wears your joints
and the stronger you become in it so the
more weight you use the more it wears
your joints
so it's kind of like that's why power
lifters have been incredibly intelligent
on program design
and oftentimes train with much lower
volume than bodybuilders
because they cannot push the volume
to the levels that bodybuilders can
because they have to use the same
movement and because they're so fucking
strong
it fucking beats them up more so they
have to get more creative and do light
sessions and technique only sessions and
vary the load and the reps
um bodybuilders can do way more volume
when you say like oh my god this
bodybuilder did
20 sets of chest well it wasn't 20 sets
of bench because nobody can fucking do
that right not nobody but
that's really hard when you're strong so
it's one of those things where if you
train more like a power lifter you end
up limiting yourself and your
bodybuilding potential
to some extent absolutely so it actually
has two questions and this one's
actually i
could just knock this one out james if
you have anything uh to add uh it's just
super quick um because kaz j had two
questions but this one is like
worth answering i think he says in this
video
where you also partially went into the
above question in like some video that i
did
you talked about lower lats upper lats
even side lats but the lat is
anatomically just one muscle
and i doubt that you can isolate certain
fibers of one muscle uh
you can't isolate them but you can
preferentially target them that's been
shown in direct literature
um because in that case someone can
literally shape their muscle bellies how
they want well so that's not how they
want
it's to a small extent so you can make
your biceps a little bit more
long or a little bit higher of a peak by
a tiny margin
by focusing on exercises that have been
demonstrated that's the thing is we
don't really know which exercises do
what
uh to target certain parts of the biceps
and not others a little bit more
it's a tiny difference and he says uh or
develop better lats or longer short
biceps higher low lat insertions well so
insertions you can't move because
those are not muscle shape they're
location of tendons and those don't move
so that one goes out the window and he
says so i don't seem to get this idea
can you explain it to me because if
that's true you say you would be able to
literally be able to
form uh all separate fibers in your
chest and create it in however form you
want
and that makes zero sense to me so it's
just at the margins
like you may be able to change your
muscle shape two and a half to five
percent or something
like that which like if you want
slightly rounder pecs maybe that's the
thing that's going to happen for you
um but if you have really really sort of
square pecs
you're not going to get amazing super
round packs just not ever you can make
them a little bit rounder if you have so
you're maybe slightly their round packs
you may be able to square them out a
little bit or something like that right
and that's just stuff that takes months
and months and years and years of
training for very very minimal
differences
but those things do exist it to a small
extent it's been confirmed literature
it's just one of those things where
something is very ineffective
or we can say very very mildly effective
is not the same thing is completely in
effect
yep agreed cool all right next up
is omkar arane
god he says and like i have a question
guys
the guy above jimmy again not a money
issue
service issue right rp would not be
happy if i was just being stingy about
the internet i think he's
i think he's kidding i know it's just
fine like it's not a choice at this
point
folks yeah for sure if i could have a
bajillion megabits per second i would
get it that would be sweet
uh all right omkarande says i have a
question regarding tracking weekly
volume
i'm currently running an upper lower
split as two days on one day off
so basically training more than four
days a week uh
uh how do i track weekly volume for
muscle group when i split isn't a weekly
split i would like your input on this
yep it's actually super easy
your split should repeat probably once
every two weeks so you track your every
two week volume and you cut it in half
easiest answer we'll ever give james
anything to add to that
yeah that's a great answer i was just
going to say you can just count it as a
micro cycle instead of a week and you
can just look at your weekly volumes at
that point that would be just
fine as well um the only thing is that
uh like
i think the two weeks is also a good
option just because it has more of a
time series effect so you'll have
kind of that cumulative fatigue effect
where it's looking at four days
and trying to figure out like is this an
appropriate weekly volume when you're
gonna actually be
a quarter of the way through your next
micro in a day or two
can be a little bit hard but either one
is is realistically fine it kind of
works itself out
over time so long as you track it
consistently the performance will
tell you what you need to know at some
point
all right bastian engerle
oh my goodness spicy
ooh a lot of clothes
ready
ready okay i'm gonna let you take this
entire question so i'll read it and then
you can knock it out
two questions for you one to which
extent are hamstrings and calves
involved in the vertical jump
and number two in a strength training
program does that increase vertical jump
should calves and hamstrings be trained
in addition to squatting power cleans
which i consider most specific
yeah that's a good question so this is
not an easy one to answer because
anthropometry plays a big role in
people's ability to do things like
jumping right so you will have people
who are built in such a way
where they might actually rely a lot
more on hip extension than
some other people and thus you might see
a little bit more hamstring activity
now for all people we can say definitely
calves play
a fairly decent role hamstrings are
involved to some degree
but probably not as much as something
like the uh
quads but again it depends largely on
your anthropometry this is something and
that you
you can just take a bunch of different
people in a laboratory and you'll get
different results on emg activity just
based on the way that they're shaped
that's just the way it goes
so um in that regard should you train
them for the purpose of jumping
sure should they be a huge priority
maybe maybe not
on the average per for the average
person now in the second question
in a strength program designed to
increase vertical jump should calves and
hamstrings be trained in addition to
squats and power cleans
so the calves i find tends to work
itself out just through your jumping and
sport
training in general i've rarely seen
someone
who made like a tangible increase in
their jumping from doing a lot of direct
calf training it tends to just the the
actual jump and sport training tends to
cover that need pretty well
you could do an ease analysis and find
that they have really really
underdeveloped calves and that's
something that's definitely
preventing them from where you would see
the calf specifically
would be in more plyometric type jumps
where they have to rebound really
quickly
right from jump if you're doing like a
squat jump or counter movement jump
you're not going to see a ton of like
calf limitations
but if you're trying to do like a depth
jump or like a power skip
or any kind of like bounding type
activities where you're trying to
minimize
ground contact time sprinting
sprinting's a good example uh that might
be a little bit more limited by
calf strength that would be an example
where that would be there uh hamstring
strength in a
in a program for vertical jump i think
is still a good idea just from a very
general standpoint but i think more of
the training should be biased towards
those
squats and power cleans if the jumping
is the primary outcome that we're
shooting for
excellent excellent excellent okay on to
joey pass
four just
oh i think yep another easy one
i'll should uh shut this one up james
and we'll see if you have any
uh pointers there sure how do you count
drop sets and rest pause towards weekly
volume so first of all is you can just
count them as their own units and not
compare them
uh you just write in your notebook these
were drop sets or these are rest pauses
and then you sort of know by themselves
and they compare them to other
drop sets and rest pauses and also you
might get a sense of their stimulus and
fatigue and sort of kind of figure out
how much they count
but if you're into the set counting
specifically which is fine
um i think we recommend something like
two-thirds
so for example let's say for both drop
sets and rest pauses
so let's say you did um three sets
of um drop sets
or sorry three sets uh yeah so three
drop sets
basically you did one set then another
cent and then another set all with you
know five to ten seconds rest
i would say you can write down in your
handy dandy book that you did three drop
sets but
if you want to do your math or whatever
you're doing with the weekly volume
it counts as two regular hypertrophic
sets i think something like that it's a
good start
same thing for um rest pauses so if you
do a set
where you take um and assuming you're
doing rest pauses fairly
correctly which means you're taking two
to three seconds between
each rest pause and not at least two to
three seconds and not like one second or
something because it doesn't really
count
um and you do let's say a set of um
hack squats where you do three rest
pause mini sets within
to basically do a set of 20 right that
you stop at
12 uh for rest two to three seconds and
then you stop at 16 to rest two or three
seconds and you basically finish so you
do
three little sets um you know so you
counted that
you could say that's three sets but it's
really not so i'd actually say that
that's
two cents so you count two thirds of how
many rest pauses you did
um and and that's something uh
i think that can work pretty well and if
you keep counting it like that and you
feel like the stinging lesson fatigue
are not adequately explained you can do
your own correction factor that works
better for you
um another thing just to mention just to
round up this discussion
if you include uh supersets there uh
agonist supersets like
tricep uh cable extensions supersets a
push-ups i count this as one and a half
so kind of similar so basically you do a
set of tricep extensions right into
push-ups
how many sets of triceps is that
quote-unquote i think it's about one and
a half because it's not
that sec that set of push-ups at the end
is not quite maximally stimulative but
it does some work so
that that's just a rubric remember folks
these are just bullshit
things we made up they're not dogmatic
they're just like you know probably a
little bit more right than they are
wrong and if you feel like it's not a
good counting system you can invent your
own that adequately
summarizes the stimulus and fatigue

you have one of the most powerful diet
coaches in your pocket
cutting edge data science tailored to
your exact goals
the future is here today yeah that was
really good
um with those things it's you kind of
have to start a new
baseline for that block of training so
if you have a block of training where
you didn't use those intensification
techniques it's going to be very hard to
just carry over that data into the next
block of training that uses those
intensification techniques so
i think dr mike's recommendation is real
good i would also just add in like just
keep in mind
your data from the previous is going to
have to be adjusted a little bit doesn't
mean if you throw it away it just means
that
these things are just so dissimilar from
doing standard set and reps you're going
to have to kind of just have a new
baseline for yourself and that's where
having like the
mev calculator the set progression
algorithm
all those things can be really helpful
so i would say if you're like okay this
block i'm including rest pauses
supersets and or drop sets
just be prepared for a new date line for
yourself
yep and it's kind of cool so you could
use these metrics
to begin with these conversion factors
just so you know how to set your volumes
in week one
and after that everything takes care of
itself because you're paying attention
to what you know the stimulus isn't
fatigue
so what we don't want you guys to do is
think okay a a single rest pause set
with four different pauses is this
equivalent of one set right
and you usually start your leg press
mezzo cycles with four sets
and you're doing four sets of four sets
and thinking that's just gonna be four
sets like that would be a fucking
disaster
so if you think about it like okay it's
actually considerably more than that
it would be you know so two-thirds would
be like basically each one of
these two and a half sets you're
essentially starting your
week your your message cycle not with
four sets of leg press but the
equivalent of ten
you know what i mean like you're gonna
get fucked up and it's gonna be way too
much so just sort of know that to begin
with and that's another thing as we say
in other videos
use your perception of fatigue and your
pump and disruption
within the workout especially in week
one to know when you've had enough like
you shouldn't be leaving the gym week
one being like oh my fucking god i'm
toast
you should be like do us at a chest
press see how you feel
do a set of chest press see i feel after
a third set you might be like oh that's
a fucking pretty good pump man and i'm
getting pretty tired
let's call it a day and then you come
back and you could always increase next
week so
it's all good stuff to use absolutely
adam wolfe who's a green
pepe the frog oh boy pepe
which makes him a white supremacist
feels like everything makes you a white
supremacist nowadays 100
true like there's very few things you
can do where people won't be like see
see
that guy you're either a white
supremacist or a libitard and both
are just completely make sense to the
people that accuse other people
all right is there a possibility that
you guys will make an entire video
focusing critiquing viewers training
programs that they wrote
and giving some minor or major
guidelines about errors and mistakes
that have been made in the program thank
you stay awesome
thanks so much for that suggestion we
may actually do some video series in the
future
um where people submit their routines
and we roast the fuck out of them and
like james and i would do like a real
full-length video on that because so we
can't do that in
uh yeah he really did say entire videos
it's very very possible that we'll do
this it's a great idea
um in in these questions we don't
usually roast whole routines
we usually prefer for you to say like
here's how i plan on training my quads
this meso
we can definitely do that it's tough
when people send us full body stuff
and want us to really pick it apart in
just a five minute question so we may
very well do that
down the line that's a great idea if
they are um
more strength conditioning type programs
like if they're more sport focused i
would actually
i would i would be glad to do that the
hypertrophy ones can be tough because
it's all
it's so individualized it's very hard to
say like oh yeah you shouldn't do this
exercise it's lame
because it might be good for you it's
hard to say that you shouldn't do these
reps but if it's like hey i'm working on
a program for volleyball or track and
field or baseball
and you want me to take a look at it
i'll do a video for that for sure
all right next one down is the great f
fa113n returns i guess it's fallen but
so creative fallen returns
internet speak get with it mike god
grandpa yeah god damn it
fucking internet all right
q anon all right
thoughts on nuclear day we had oregon
trail that's right oh that was great man
and uh what was that lake there was like
a lake game
late game i'm gonna google it hold on
oregon
like duck hunt or rail lake
game it was called something really
uh
odell lake i don't remember that um
i'm just gonna quick
uh this is great okay can i share my
screen really quick
yeah hold on let me unshare mine
okay this is all you need to know
what you are a white fish
yeah so like that's what it was and you
could process chase away
more cause like if you try to eat right
it just eats you because it's bigger
than you
but if you chase away it's trying to eat
you it's bigger than you
if you ignore it eats you so then
shallow escapes stupid because it's
athletic so you want deep escape and
then you get away so it just presents
you with a bunch of different animals
and you have to judge which one you want
to eat or whatever that game looks
amazing i never played that one
yeah we played it in school to learn i
don't know what but you know what i'm
saying
some motherfuckers you run into out
there is going to eat your ass and some
of them
you can fuck up so it's uh
that's it um how the fuck do i hold on
bud
oh stop sharing okay cool all right back
to
the youtube questions next up is
did we get fall returns answered already
or no no we didn't we didn't do the
question
uh yes okay thoughts on nuclei overload
training
it's been promoted lately by several
youtubers that have sizable audiences
and i think
it needs address it needs to addressed
needs to be addressed as there's too
much misinformation on the internet
thanks
so actually um we already have a
[Music]
video a videographer uh or our rp
videographer and i already have a video
written it's not released yet it'll
eventually be released we are a little
bit ahead of schedule on how many videos
we're making so
it's going to be months from now it'll
completely peel apart
nuclei overload training uh but the
preview is
it's a fucking scam and a gimmick and
it's fucking ridiculous if you train
hard
nuclei will be incorporated from
satellite cells into the major
uh belly of the muscle uh into
functional sarcomeres
or in functional muscle fibers on a
regular basis
there's absolutely no convincing
evidence that doing a special super
specific kind of training does this
better
uh whatsoever and at some point you run
out of these
satellite cells anyway um so it's uh
you know training hard is good but
training so hard that you risk injury
highly much more than you would normally
and get
outside of your momentum of normal
regular consistent training
and risk burnout and injury and
overreaching and high fatigue it's just
not worth it so james i don't know if
you're familiar with nuclear
evolutionism
you go insane for a couple of weeks and
do like triple the normal volume and
it's supposed to migrate satellite cells
in
because they like took one study that
says if you damage
uh a muscle fiber the uh satellite cell
proliferation occurs
the funny thing is is they've shown
satellite support or
proliferation with minimal or no damage
also it's just
a normal part of the growth process yeah
i would say this is like tantamount to
um
taking someone who's on uh let's say
they're eating 100 grams of protein a
day but they weigh 200 pounds
and making them eat 400 grams of protein
like yeah you sure will get enough
protein but it might be a giant pain in
the ass and
actually it's more snack because there's
really no downside from eating too much
protein other than wasting your money
there is a downside here where you could
get hurt
um because you're all multiplying your
volume like crazy uh you're off on your
frequency like crazy
uh so it's uh it's one of these things
where
it's just not worth it and just do good
training
i'll tell you what the closest you'll
come to whatever nuclear overload
training is
is in your last week of a motorcycle
before you deload and that's like you
know
too much or really close to too much and
then you deload and the nuclei
migrate and then you start the process
all over again so that's it
i was actually going to go there and see
like these motherfuckers who who
purport to do this are motherfuckers who
didn't deload before because they were
just doing
weak ass pussy training for a long time
yeah and then they discovered functional
overreaching for the first time like
look at my gains like yeah
you you suck you've scored
shitty training forever congratulations
yeah
slap yourself on the back
all right the next person has a fucking
funny question i think he's maybe
tongue-in-cheek but i included it anyway
it's chris stoddard okay got it
and he says how much do i need to
overhead press to get impressive abs
not much i guess i mean
so darren hawkins uh viewer you could
answers with 225 pounds
we'll give you a thick ass i think abs
that will be impressive i can't disagree
with that i've never met anyone who can
overhead press 225
and has small abs but also impressive is
very subjective and also depends on how
much you weigh and how tall you are and
how small your waist is
um i had all the training it took to get
there
yeah i'll put it to you this way if
you're overhead pressing
your body weight for at least a rep your
abs probably aren't
uh on a bodybuilding stage likely to
receive the critique of they're too
small
uncomfortable i agree with that i would
say that uh
doing overhead press is probably not a
good way of
trying to enhance your abs though for
sure for sure in case that wasn't cheeky
which i think it was
so just training
all right next up is i
lost him
oh my god okay next up is darren hawkins
he's down below the red jacob kowalski
so ready
okay what is your opinion on seal rose
with no eccentric for bodybuilding
would it allow more volume martin
burkhan is the pound-for-pound strongest
at this lift
that's interesting title um yes but how
much can he strict lateral raise
it's an oddly specific title yeah and
it's absolutely something martin burkhan
would brag about
because he's fucking nuts um but uh
at this lift and says it's the best from
form of row he says a lot of dumb shit
like this is the best this and that he
also
says that he trains harder than everyone
but he does like two sets to failure
three times a week
he's like a a really smart guy full of
amazing ideas
and completely fucking insane shit so
treat everyone with a grain of salt
martin burkin especially
um which is a poliquin exactly paul
couldn't have tons of like wow holy shit
i never thought of this and then tons of
shit were like you're just lying
you must be lying because you're not
this stupid right so
um darren hawkins uh the best answer
here is let's just pick this
apart um c rose with no eccentric okay
so eccentrics are really really good for
hypertrophy so we wouldn't want to just
get rid of them we'd have to have a good
reason to do so
uh so i would say that's probably not
great uh but if
if you have a situation where you can
use a lot more weight
without a really controlled eccentric
maybe it might be if it's getting you a
good pump
good mind muscle connection and stuff
like that then that's fine right but
it's certainly not a gold standard
and i would say if someone has an
exercise that really milks the eccentric
or is conducive for do it could do
something for doing so
i'm much more prepared to hear how great
of an exercise it is for bodybuilding
when something is necessarily no
eccentric i'm already skeptical that it
would have to be it would have to be
real good
mind muscle connection for me to be like
oh yeah it's worth dumping the eccentric
right
and then would it allow more volume yes
but if that volume is not a stimulative
then that's all
purposeless remember you you don't want
to allow more volume you want to allow
more stimulus if that volume brings
more stimulus that's good but just more
volume for its own stakes not great
um and the best form of road there's no
such thing
right but it seems like a swell form of
roe the reason it can't be the best is
because it doesn't train the spinal
erectors and a lot of the other
musculature
that is basically um canceled out by you
lying on a bench doing zeros so the best
row
if you had to pick which you shouldn't
and can't is a barbell bent overall
or very strict but you know
uh this year can be can be great um
and darren try it and if you like it
after a few months fucking use it and if
you're like man this sucks
then don't you know like uh i know some
people uh alberto nunez of 3dmj
loves the crow and he says it's amazing
fucking kudos to him then i think people
should use it if they works
i hate it and i don't i don't get
anything out of it and
i would never say it's a bad exercise
because it just doesn't seem to tick my
boxes
as far as my muscle connection uh or
pump or soreness or anything like that
and i like some other exercises better
which other people don't like
so yeah there's no good reason to go
looking for
the best exercise you because here's the
thing if you pick the best exercise
it'll get stale anyway you'll have to
pick another one sooner or later
true so i agree with dr mike here and no
surprise we're kind of on opposite sides
of the exercise selection spectrum again
i like the seal row especially with the
cambered bar so the way i would usually
program it for somebody is
use a cam bar and just do like a light
hyper extension like mike said you can't
really load
the spinal erectors that much but you
can add like a little kind of like a
superman style
light extension and that seems to help
the thing with taking out the concentric
aside from what mike already said or
sorry the eccentric um
is that i think that's really appealing
for people who don't get a lot out of
rose because they don't know how to
control their
technique and their scapulas very well
because we've already talked about this
on many episodes
where a lot of people do rows and they
just lock up their scaps and then
they're just kind of doing
that from that point on right the the
seal row really
allows you to actually really get a good
protraction retraction at least in my
experience especially if you have that
can bar
so i think for people who get frustrated
on rows it just gives them an excuse to
continue doing the same shit that they
always do rather than actually trying to
really focus on correcting the technique
getting a good mind muscle connection
with the scapular retraction and
protraction and then and again it's easy
for me to say that
it's it's hard it's a hard thing to do
and it's something even when we were
professors when we would have labs it
was very difficult to kind of get
students used to the idea of keeping one
part of their back arched or you know
rigid or neutral and allowing the
protraction and retraction to occur
independently it's not an easy thing to
do
so i think that concentric only is just
an excuse to be like all right
locked up locked up locked up like
you're just doing the same shit that you
would be doing anyway um
so i think that is not a good idea not
to mention that this is a stupid problem
but uh
wear and tear on your equipment too if
you don't mind replacing your weights in
your bars every couple years then that's
not a big deal but for most of us if
you're trying if the goal is to try and
use more weight and and just drop it
every single time
and you're going to wear out that bar
and those collars pretty quick so i
don't
i would not recommend it though i do
like the exercise but again
i think the benefit of the exercise is
that you can turn your brain off
to the hard stuff which is trying to
maintain your your posture
while doing the protraction and
retraction and this all you have to do
is focus on doing the protraction the
retraction and not the postural part so
that's a big win so do it that's the
whole point it's like doing the chest
supported row same idea like it's
that that is one of the big benefits of
doing that on the chest supported you
can kind of lean back into it a little
bit more but
same idea
[Music]
okay
[Music]
all the way down fourth question from
last
is mike i don't know how he got this
incredible name
locked down but he's just not mike
that's it
one and only
ready thanos in there king of the north
had a whole bunch of questions oops
yeah yeah there it is head to load got
it
all right ifbb greg dusat
says most people will not be able to
achieve their goal physique naturally or
with drugs
so should you aim for 50 of their goal
so should only aim for 50
of the gold do you agree so
it's a pretty typical thing greg
gassette says that
so at face value looks completely
fucking retarded
uh but actually has some insight as most
of the
most not all the things he says
absolutely do have a big grain of truth
um he just has a funny way of saying
things sometimes though it was
tough tough for folks to think a bit
more critically so
i think the completely true
underpinning of what he's saying here is
that
a lot of people make their i like goal
physique
something completely insane that
takes way longer with much more
dedication than they are willing to
prepare for so a lot of times james and
i have been personal trainers for a long
time
people will come to you in september and
give you a picture of jlo and be like i
want to look like this for my high
school reunion right before thanksgiving
and you're like yeah
easy you just need to lose 180 pounds of
fat and gain 50 pounds of muscle
and completely reshape your bones it'll
be the easiest thing you've ever done
right so
i think greg is absolutely on to
something super super
wise here which is you know
people have crazy ass goals and a lot of
people's goals
maybe they're within reason so straight
up he's right on face value sometimes
there's just not within reason
a lot of times a lot more times i think
they're within reason but on a time
scale which is
maybe 10 times longer than they thought
and on a level of effort input which is
10 times
more you know insight than because you
know james and i have
james remember personal training people
will be like all right i want to look
like this you're like okay great we're
going to start cutting your fats and
carbs and you're going to do this much
cardio they're like
can i just do this other diet instead
and you're like
you can do what you want but you do what
you want you sure as hell not going to
look like what you want to look like i
get
if you still want to do your normal diet
you're probably going to look like you
normally look which is why you're here
so can i just pay you money to make it
great and not change
gears money i will wait my body to
arrive in the mail hopefully one day
we'll be at that point
but not yet so um
and and you know so so that's that's
really like
the kicker there is is that time scale
issue and that work issue
so but that last part of statements says
so should only aim for 50
of their goal i think
again that's phrased in a very
interesting way but i think there's a
huge grain of truth there and that is
start out with some fraction of your
goal
first okay small fraction okay you want
to lose 45 pounds of fat and gain 15
pounds of muscle
got it no problem over the next six
months let's lose
15 pounds of fat and gain five pounds of
muscle
see how you look see how you feel take a
little deload take a little break
and then try another one of those chunks
and then see how you're going because
massive goals you know it's like you're
building a rocket to go to space let's
like build the booster complex
first and then see if that fucking works
and then we'll talk about the rest
you know it's not something you just go
out there and you're like that's it like
i want my dream because people start
training
i want to be in the mr olympia like
that's cool why don't you get a little
bit more jacked and lean
and then if you succeed at doing that
and you like it then you can see how
much more
you can succeed at and then over time
you repeat this process your genetics
and your proclivity for effort will show
how much further you're going like i
wanted to get a little bit bigger
when i was younger and i got a little
bit bigger and then i was like i want to
get a little bit bigger and then i got a
little bigger and i was like i'm too fat
i want leaner so i got a little leaner
and over time i eventually like got way
bigger and leaner than i ever thought i
was going to be i'm like
holy shit i didn't know if i met myself
now when i was in high school i'd have a
fucking panic attack and run in the
other direction
i had no idea i was going to get this
jack and lean uh not particularly just
yet but pretty jacked
uh but it was just like you know i i i
didn't even know so i'm the other end
spectrum where i had no
idea you know i never had goals this big
but it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter if your goals
eventually are to become enormously
jacked and super shredded or they're
really minor it everyone goes through
the minor phase so just pick a
a goal that's a little challenging a
little very realistic
hit it first reevaluate and then keep
going keep going keep going and then
eventually your genetics will tell you
uh you know when it may be time to use
drugs and if you make that decision and
you're kind of in a country which is
legal you know if you're in the uk
maybe you can start using anabolics or
the supervision of a doctor because you
have goals that only anabolics will take
you there because you've
exhausted your natty limb and that's
another big reason why james and i are
super against
uh natty's starting on gear after like
one or two years of training
motherfucker you could have just done
completely natural three or four years
you would have looked the same as you
did on gear two and a half years later
you're gonna just shut your health away
your dick doesn't work anymore you have
fucking puffy nipples
and rock on so it's one of those things
where i think
greg just had us absolutely on to some
real real
true shit which is like easy on the
fucking crazy goals let's just build one
step at a time and see how it goes james
yeah that's good and i'm a gold building
too right like you might want to lose
all this fat and gain all this muscle
but like so
start with something simple right like
let's just run a diet if you've never
run a diet before that can be
overwhelming for a lot of people just do
a diet for 10 to 15 weeks see how it
goes
right then you could diet again and say
you know what that went pretty good i'm
going to take a break
and i'm going to make some changes to
the next one i have a little bit of
experience
try again same thing with training like
have you ever tried to figure out your
mrv before
give it a try take a couple mesos and
figure out like how much you can train
right
and then once you get a good grasp on
that you can look at things like auto
regulating like
how can i actually learn how to auto
regulate my training a little bit
little little things go a long way and
those those habits like learning how to
do a diet
learning how to do good training we're
going to carry you so much further
than just looking at the numbers on a
scale or a bia saying like well this
went down and this one it's like that's
all bullshit who cares
you can always change that later i think
the the phrasing is what really kills me
on this and maybe mike was paraphrased
not you might put the
youtube mike here was paraphrasing or
whatever or maybe he just phrased it
really stupidly but
like the implication of like when it
says like should you only train
or aim for 50 of your goals it's kind of
hard to
support that because that kind of
implies like 50 compliance as well like
we're like i'm only going to go for half
of what i think i can get like
how much effort how much how hard are
you really going to go for that
i think we really it starts in the
beginning and mike already beat this to
death where
you might have to temper your
expectations a little bit
but try and be the best you that you can
be like go 100
on that like your best might not be at
ifbb pro level someday and that's okay
it doesn't mean that
you're any less valuable just be the
best you that you can be put the best
effort that you can
the other thing is like you might not be
able to spend
two sessions per day for one to two
hours training that might not be in your
wheelhouse you might have family you
might have kids you might have well
pumps that go
out which means that need to be cut and
dogs that pp everywhere right
you might have other stuff going on so
within the constrictions of your
lifestyle
and the things that you are able to do
you have to get outside of your comfort
zone a little bit but you got to find
that sweet spot of
okay i have some realistic restrictions
i have some lofty goals
where can i meet in the middle where i'm
the most happy right we're meaning i'm
making progress towards those body
composition goals
while not having to abandon all of my
friends all of my family all of my work
all the things that are important to me
i think like just just saying like okay
well you're stupid
only shoot for half of what you think
you want it's just you're just
it's just a dumb way of saying it
because it's just it's not addressing
the real issues and just setting
yourself up for cycles of
boom failure oh my god i wasn't
attacking
the question ask her uh i just i
sometimes
greg ducette says stuff that like uh so
yeah and also like to cut greg
to send some slack a lot of times when
people paraphrase stuff
it some some shit lost in translations
so greg descent might have actually said
something more technically correct but
and it's like you know our like okay at
the end of the day like
yeah he's mostly right but it's just uh
it's the specific like
50 you know like that's for sure just a
made-up number
but there's lots of made-up numbers that
correspond pretty roughly to the truth
so
it's less yeah many people i don't know
about most but many people have goals
and like we said on the timelines with
the effort magnitudes that are just
wildly out of reach and does that mean
go down by fifty percent of some kind of
magic formula
james and i don't think so even if greg
does
but we do think that you should at the
very least chop off realistic goals
finish them and then see what's what's
next you know that's it
it's like you know you wanted to walk 20
miles today why don't you walk two or
three and see how your feet feel and
then you can tell us if you want to walk
more
that's it my favorite one is
like i need to be shredded in you know
three months or whatever and it's like
motherfucker you've been like
obese your whole life what's the urgency
like you have this has never been
important to you you know what i mean
like
i mean ob slightly i'm not trying to
make fun of people but like you get this
a lot where you get people who have been
out of shape
for the entirety of their life and then
they say like well now i want to be
you know fitness model have a fitness
model worthy physique
in three months it's like is it really a
priority to you because it doesn't seem
like it seems like you you know
having a good social life and maybe
having a few beers and pizzas on the
weekend seems to be a pretty big
priority right and
do you think same thing like oh sorry
i'm ranting and
i apologize but uh same thing when
people kind of start their fitness
journey one of the most common things
that we get is like i want to run a
marathon
it's like don't you think that's kind of
disrespectful for people for people who
train for marathons like you think you
can just do it you think you can just do
that
motherfucker you can't even stand on
your feet as long as it takes to run a
marathon
you know and a lot of people like will
walk a marathon and be like i did it i
completed my marathon
like that's cool but it's like
okay but maybe like why don't you just
start with like
first goal is to be able to run
consistently second goal
is to do some competition 5ks third goal
is to run a half marathon and fourth
goal years later is to run a full
marathon
like that sounds great like why not oh
marathon right away like jeez you know
maybe but there's a chance to just burn
out never want to do it again that's the
real big downside
yeah and that that that it's the same
idea again right just like having
temper your expectations a little bit
especially if you're a beginner and it's
okay to be a beginner there's no shame
one thing that does piss me off too is
when you've ever seen like or heard
somebody fat shaming like the fat guy at
the gym
like look at that fat fuck on that trip
so stupid dude i'm like what do you
think he's here for idiot
dumb motherfucker look at you spencer
happy and also you're weak compared to
everyone you should be embarrassed
actually just kidding you shouldn't be
embarrassed for yourself either it gets
it's so funny too because like
those people it's it's really funny how
fucking full of dog shit
some people tend to like we all tend to
be every now and again we don't even
mean it
like you could be like to your friends
like like fat fuck on the treadmill look
at them and then the guy doesn't ever
hear you he comes up to you and he goes
hey man
um notice you're doing curls or whatever
you have a great physique like i aspire
to look like you
what are you going to do 99 times out of
100 oh my god thank you so much
geez you didn't have to say that dude
thanks hey listen keep up the good work
you're great
and then they walk away and you get this
like cognitive sense where you're like
oh i'm a piece of shit
like a person right like we all have our
times we're making fun of people and
when it's all for fun it's cool
but some people get into that shit like
seriously like there's some like
gym shark posted some girl who's just
not in very good shape
uh and she's like talking about body
positivity and
like hey like this is my shape and i'm
okay with all of it and like it's cool
to be like yeah i'm sweet you know i'm
saying it's not my cup of tea
like i'm just not gonna like this post
because i don't like the shape
i like posts with people i do like shave
there's people on there like what the
fuck
this is the disservice to your brand how
dare you it's like
oh what the hell is wrong with you like
you man
why didn't you have to post it yeah you
have to like i'm gonna make sure this
person knows that i personally don't
approve of her physique like
you're the man you know you likely have
no friends and you live with your mom
fucking internet culture man it's so
crazy how people
queuing on james there's a conspiracy
where pedophiles or
manufacturing children i don't know the
details
they're manufacturing children why not
what do you think the vaccine is for
idiot oh pandemic james
it was planned so conspiracy stuff man
the worst conspiracy is the worst yeah
um i was gonna oh have you been watching
the boys season two
