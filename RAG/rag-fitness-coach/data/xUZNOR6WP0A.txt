hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
prioritization with jared feather
also for renaissance periodization today
we are going to talk about the mistakes
and the fixes to the most hardcore
exercise of all time
of the leg extension here we go
number one this should go without saying
but
the way some people do leg extensions
you have no idea if it's true
the target in leg extensions is just one
muscle
the quadriceps that's it so this is the
ultimate isolation exercise and a lot of
the fixes we have
are to make sure it stays that way the
first thing we're going to talk about
is making sure that we're not cutting
our range of motion
jared why don't you do us a little
high-level leg press
for ego only let's crank out these reps
baby yeah
oh yeah yeah don't lock it out something
bad will happen if you lock out it's bad
for your knees definitely don't go all
the way down
what the hell is going on who knows in
order
for us to standardize the repetitions to
track our progress and
assign more stimulus and in order to get
the most out of both the peak
contraction
and the full stretch at the bottom we're
going to want to maximize the range of
motion leg press
which really just means serve three tips
tip number one is
for whatever the machine is capable of
you
essentially execute the most range of
motion you can
this particular machine is good not
great it
has a decent range of motion other
machines are better where they let you
go deeper but jared is going as deep as
he can
and he's going to go all the way up so
give us just a good decent wrap all the
way up
and all the way down he's going to know
it's a wrap when
either he's at full extension or he
hears a clank
on this thing if you don't air clank or
no full extensions there's a chance
you're not using the machine
properly second thing when you actually
find the machine that you want
usually or often there's some kind of
mechanism around this area
to adjust the actual depth that it goes
if there is a depth adjuster
nine times out of ten you want maximum
depth yes
i know you won't be able to leg extend
six hundred thousand pounds and that
super cute girl at the gym isn't gonna
look at you the same week she'll be like
oh my god he only like extends like 80.
boring she's going to get into that
other guy mercedes convertible
and you'll just be lonely forever the
thing is nobody actually cares how much
you learn to stand
you shouldn't either so you want to jam
that selector into the
maximum possible range of motion so
that's tip number two whatever machine
you have
max out the rom last tip is
this is an optional one but it's really
good is to make sure you focus on that p
contraction here's the thing
leg presses squats every single pressing
thing for quads
does the majority of your quad perch for
your work anyway but the only thing it
doesn't get
is the peak contraction under load how
the hell do you p
contract a hack squat
you lock out and you're like but that's
not against load anymore because the
load is surely vertical at that point
leg extension offers you the ability to
contract which actually recruits
some parts of your quads a little bit
differently take advantage
we usually recommend not always but give
some thought to a
one second peak top hold so you're going
to lock out and squeeze the very top
against wrists for a full second
and then come all the way down and
gently touch and back up so jared show
us what real full range of motion looks
like with all those three
boom that's one do a couple more all the
way down
boom top hold and this is gonna burn
like shit
boom and you're good to go that is full
range of motion
leg extension training
[Music]
mistake number two is not adjusting the
seat properly
ideally what you want is for the seat to
align in such a way
that you're comfortable and this crease
right here right where the
seat ends is right in your what is that
called popliteal fossa technically
speaking
so right in the bend of your knee
anything else is a bad
idea if the seat is so far back jared
try to do a leg extension here
i can't even like reach into the machine
and then if you scoop
scoot way too far forward if you screw
way too far forward
there's going to be like some weird
discomfort there you're kind of off the
machine
force production goes down and then it
could be some your knee joint actually
starts to get pulled apart at the bottom
a bit of pain
it's kind of weird super awkward it's
not a trick it's not a tip it's the
easiest thing in the world
just get the seat as close as you can to
where the edge of the seat is right in
that uh joint right between your knee
and sorry right between your calf and
hamstring
whatever's comfy and is not obviously
limiting your range of motion or
force production is absolutely the right
way to go almost every leg extension is
a seat adjuster if it doesn't
you can put a pad on the seat or just
angle your body a bit differently
nature if anything else if nothing else
that your knees
are feeling like they have a good range
of motion and a good perch off which to
work
next concern is making sure the foot pad
is properly aligned
there's almost always going to be a
length selector for where the foot pad
touches
right now jared has it set up really
good jared take your knees out for a
second i'll show
where is bad we're not going to mess
with this thing because who the hell
knows how it works
but here's the deal if you put the foot
pad
over your toes somewhere that's fine
it's a really awesome moment arm you
have to use very little weight
uh cool however your actual ability
to extend your feet may become a
limiting factor
so you may be failing on the exercise
because you're
collapsing in your ability to hold your
toes up and not because your quads are
failing
bad news even if you're not failing that
soon you could just be getting irritated
and a burn here and discomfort in your
ankles
we don't want that to interfere with
maximum force production to get as many
reps as possible
to meet your target now there is an
opposite way of going too far
some people put the pad where it's like
right here is that technically okay
yeah sure big problem is it usually
limits your range of motion
we don't want that and another one you
have to use a ton of weight okay fine
and also it's sort of mildly arbitrary
you may forget where exactly you're
putting it what we kind of want
is to use as little weight as possible
to use the maximum range of motion
possible
but to not be limited by our feet or
anything like that
so ideally you want to put the pad right
here
just above where the ankle flexes and
extends
that's almost always perfect as long as
it's also comfy and here's the last big
tip
on this point write down in your
training journal whatever i use my
iphone i just type it in
which exact number you have on this
selector
and which exact number you have on the
seat so when you come back for your next
week's workout you don't have to push
around and have an awkward feel
you can select the seat select the
extender and you're on your way to
having exactly the same setup which not
only means it's the best setup for you
but also it's the same one last time you
can adequately prescribe loading
characteristics
and adequately track progress
the next problem is an uncontrolled
eccentric
here's the thing if you want to get as
many concentric reps of leg extension as
possible
that's neat but there's no competition
for that so who cares
the eccentric phase the lengthening
phase of muscle contraction
is very hypertrophic it literally causes
muscle growth we don't want to miss out
on it
right you're not going to get hurt if
you slam the weight down on a leg
extension
it's really hard to get hurt in a leg
extension but you're just wasting reps
now here's the thing
nine times out of ten when people really
skimp on the eccentric why are they
doing it
because it hurts and it builds more
lactate and it means you can't get as
many reps
you can't brag to your friends that you
did a set of 15 with 100 pounds in the
leg extension and they don't throw a
special party for you
good news none of that shit happens so
milk the eccentric now does that mean
you have to do a four second center
no it's fine to do up to as long as a
four second eccentric
but at least a one full second count all
the way down
is good the way we're going to manage it
is we're going to make sure first of all
we do the eccentric properly but also
we're going to ensure it by saying only
a gentle touch at the bottom
no slamming because that by definition
means you're not controlling eccentric
gentle touch at the bottom means you
have to control it jared show us what it
looks like wrong
do some bro reps yeah throw it up
awesome all right that accomplishes
something better accomplishment is when
we control it so go ahead
and control and gentle touch and control
and gentle touch
easy to have a good mind muscle
connection when you're in control
that's what we want
all right two for one tip here because
these tend to occur very often together
no standard range of motion for each rep
so all the reps end up being different
some touch some don't some are peak
extension and hold
some are not and the other problem is
any kind of body wiggling
that does not involve your quads which
means usually hips come
off the bench it's wartime brother load
the clips
rebellion world war three type bullshit
that doesn't actually get you jacked
so jared let's do some wartime training
mess up the consistency of the rom and
let's get some body into it
yeah yeah get them yeah get them hips up
more
yeah perfect awesome all you need is an
m60 and a cigar
and you're a fucking commando here's the
deal the leg extension is a boring lift
that is designed to target a very
specific muscle it should be done with a
very meticulous execution
if you want to wig out on stuff go do
stone loading and be an actual strong
man
you're here to accomplish a task which
means every rep is going to touch gently
at the bottom
full extension at the top and notice
what is moving only
his quads only knee extension is
happening the rest of the body does not
get involved
plain and simple
next tip not exactly a technique tip but
a huge thing we can't really leave out
loading range the leg extension is
just not suited for high force
production it's just not
compounds are way way better for that if
you're hack squatting leg pressing and
doing regular squats and lunges
your quads get tons of force throughput
that takes care of the tension stuff
super well
the leg extension is more of a targeted
move probably best off generating
metabolites
and really nasty pumps okay the way you
do that
is mostly through sets of 15 to 30 reps
that's right i didn't stutter sets of 15
to 30 reps
and if you're thinking holy shit 30 reps
that's gonna burn me alive
that's the whole point you can't do sets
of 30 on squats and probably not
packed squats either because you'll run
out of air and systemic fatigue
before you actually get the muscle hit
targeted but if you do sets of like
5 to 10 on the leg extension it just
kind of feels weird on your knees and
your
joints and someone's again man you got a
big pump you're like oh
do you feel your quads like i don't know
i think i'm doing something
right you don't do sets of five to ten
unlike you know the tricep dumbbell
extension leaned over
that would be insane you do sets of five
to ten on close grip benches and dips
and stuff
and then for the more isolation stuff
the high reps simply have a better
stimulus to fatigue ratio
that's we're going to do now this is not
a religious text
can you do less than 15 reps on a leg
extension
on a first set and get great results you
absolutely may and if you want try it to
see
we're just warning you in advance
probably you're not going to like that
sets of 15 to 30 reps are probably where
it's at
next tip again not exactly on technique
of execution
but the best way to get the most out of
this exercise
do you have to do only straight sets
well on things like squats
yeah on leg presses you can absolutely
do my reps and so
you can on hack squats drop sets on hack
squats and leg presses are
tough at the very least annoying for
your partners and also even if they work
sort of hypothetically
it ends up being that your gas tank your
lungs and your heart and so on and so
forth
end up being limiting factor before your
actual quads right a lot of times
leg presses are uh pretty good for drop
sets
but just not super often because it
turns into a cardio thing
because we can't do maya reps super well
especially drop sets and things like
that on leg presses hack squats and
squats are main quad builders
this is a time to get them done if
you're doing straight sets of 10
on the leg extension we're not judging
you but we're just thinking like
isn't that best done for every other
exercise you do for quads when you get a
leg extension it's a special tool with a
huge limitation
you can't produce high forces but the
advantage is drop sets are super easy
and so are my rep sets
here's an example of an excellent maya
website you can try we're not going to
have jared actually do it
jared pretend like you're doing it or
something like that jared's going to do
a set of ten
one rep shy of failure hit it like you
know let's pretend it's 10 uh
and it's going to get really hard and
that's that's one rep shy and he's going
to stop
okay and he's either going to pull his
legs out or not he can keep him in there
a lot of times jared you want to do that
like
sit forward he's going to sit forward to
take the lactate a little out of his
quads
as soon as he doesn't feel the lactic
acid burning him to death anymore he's
going to sit right back in
and do another set of like all four to
six reps and he's gonna keep doing that
until he can't do but two or three reps
anymore
with those mini three to four second
rest breaks fucking brutality
try that shit just do a few of those
sets because it's gonna burn you alive
it's awesome and it's not really
something you can easily do on other
quad exercises
another easy one same idea say maya rep
style
except drop style so you do a set of 10
and then boom boom boom he does it and
these finishes
we drop the weight from the current 45
to the 30. i guess jared's really weak
we drop it down one he gets in and he
hits it again and again and again
and so on and so forth awesome
incredibly easy you can even do this
yourself if you train alone because you
can just drop it for yourself
no problem look if you have training
partners can you do
a drop sign on leg presses yeah what if
you don't have training partners you're
gonna do a set of leg press get up take
a 45 off throw up on it
fall down it hits you you pass out and
then what right it doesn't work in
theory
so a leg extension is great we're not
saying you can't do straight sets you
totally can
but because your training should be some
combination of straight sets
and you know these intensity techniques
and we have another video talking about
when that combination is a good idea
you might as well use a leg extension
where it's best suited for that kind of
funky stuff
all right last tip and last sort of
mistake
is the idea that there is an ideal foot
width and toe angle and toe position so
we got a lot of we got a lot of shit
going on let's give the grand tour
so let's try super narrow knees
toes pointed straight to the sky yep
that's to hit your vastus inner
fuckiness
and then wait hold on motherfuckers
thought this shit was advanced
wide stance toes pointed in
and down that shit actually hits your
cock muscles so if you want a bigger
dick
what the hell am i talking about here's
the thing okay
bad news short of surgery none of us are
getting any bigger down there you feel
me
first of all yeah i spent a lot of money
on those pills that went nowhere
here's the real kicker is are there tiny
differences
in variable quad activation from foot
positions and stuff
absolutely but they're teeny weeny
and you'll almost never notice them now
if you're a top pro or top national
level guy
and you need more outer sweep or
whatever yeah there may be an
arrangement you can use that's a little
bit better than another
however the number one critical factor
for you to select the best one of these
is the stimulus to fatigue ratio which
comes down to
comfort first are you comfortable
with that position if it feels awkward
it's stupid because you're not going to
be able to generate a lot of force
second
are you able to get get oomph out of
your quads like you feel like it's a
strong position
awesome and lastly is it hitting your
quads in a way that you get off
afterwards the machine and you're like
oh that definitely did some shit versus
if someone shows you some funky foot
position and you do a set to failure and
they're like
quads right you're like i don't know
like i kind of felt the outside of my
knee a little bit
you want just the thing that keeps your
joints the safest feeling the best able
to produce force
and able after the set to be like holy
shit that's the way to hit the quads
that's all you want now within that area
of confinement
are there different variations you can
use for positions whatever totally
that's up to you to find
just do not expect there to be this one
completely correct answer
it's like asking someone like hey man
when you eat pasta to get jacked
like are you using like ragu sauce
or using like five brothers sauce
because which one's gonna even put that
what
that is not the shit that gets you
jacked we'll get you jack progressive
overload over time
in a hyper-caloric state and that's it
so focus on the basics
you can use all the foot positions you
want just don't think that like
so all of a sudden you're using great
leg extension you're doing a
great stimulus to fatigue ratio and a
pro comes by and he's like i see you're
pointing your feet out and you're like
oh he's like
you fucking idiot no one gets jacked
like that that is
bullshit do the good stuff stick to the
basics
folks that's all the tips we have next
time i see you commenting on the videos
your quads had better be so big it
interferes with the quality of life
and then you need the dick surgery
