I'm bringing violence today fellas I've
had enough charlatan nonsense ain't no
more Nuance left in this mother you Joel
seedman and if you see me in the street
you know what I'm saying I'm joking of
[Music]
course hey folks I'm Dr Mike isrel
professor of sport and exercise science
co-founder of Renaissance puration
bodybuilder Grappler Etc but mostly I'm
known for talking smack on the internet
in video a form specifically about folks
that have some modum of Fame and are
exercising some combination of well or
not well and today we are going to be
setting our laser beam sites on Mr no
doctor exai science I believe Joel
seedman let's do it when we look at all
areas of
Kinesiology all righty I'm
triggered so just a background of who
Joel seedman is Joel seedman has I think
a PhD in exercise science he's uh
similarly qualified to myself except he
likes to create really fancy exercises
that have a lot of complexity to them
and layer in all sorts of ideas about
why such fancy exercises are good to the
untrained eye and absolutely without any
kind of surprise this seems like really
cool stuff that like wow like there's
complexity to it and complexity is
typically associated with highlevel
results like if they show you how a
stealth fighter works and they sort of
open up the panel there's all these
crazy wires and all this other stuff
you're not going to be like I thought it
was simpler you like well no wonder it
can fly and detected and drop bombs
anywhere in the world of course it's
complicated so when you see the kind of
folks and Joel sedman does work with
pretty high level folks you see the kind
of folks he's training you see that he
has a PHD you see that he has a large
following social media and you think ah
this level of complexity must be what's
getting folks results
and his explanations are ostensibly to
describe that level of complexity and
make you understand why that his very
very special specific kinds of
approaches yield a lot of upside and I'm
going to tell you something at the
beginning of this video because
fortunately or not I know who Mr Doctor
Joel seedman is I have debated him on
Mark Bell's power project before and um
I know for a near fact though everyone
is entitled to some wiggle room that
he's a with a ter escapes me at the
moment fcking liar charlatan piece of
 am I allowed to say that we'll see
if that makes through the editing
process so let's find out how many lies
we can spot don't worry there will be
very many and I will explain them all to
you by all I mean at least some cuz
there's a lot of explaining to do let's
get to the
video so what does science say about
squat
depth let's find out including
neuromuscular physiology biomechanics
and structural physiology structural
physiology is called Anatomy mistake
number one they all put to 90 is optimal
that's it they all point to 90 is
optimal the The Joint angle of 90° is
supposed to be optimal for I don't know
strength maybe hypertrophy possibly
athletic performance is some kind of
generalized idea of that definitely um
and I guess it's for muscle growth
strength joint health and Athletics 90°
is uh optimal so I'll tell you right now
being that I'm actually an expert in
this field specifically that's make
belief lie that's just not true
Joel's not actually strong enough to
zercher squat this amount of weight a
very high amount of weight to zercher
squat so what he's doing is he's relying
on bands to be able to put more weight
on the bar working against himself
because he could put at much lighter
bands on and use uh much less weight get
the exact same effect for way less work
but that wouldn't be good for a social
media game because it doesn't seem as
impressive to the untrained eye and if
there's Joel seedman good at one thing
it's impressing the untrained eye also
setting up this kind of band apparatus
would take you 20 to 30 minutes to do
putting all the weight on there would
take you longer than that and then
you're off to the races after 40 minutes
of setting up this exercise to
do something a leg press lung or squat
could have done for you in mere minutes
thanks Joel so
useful oh an athlete no what's he doing
with that ball I'll just wait oh I know
what he's going to do with that ball
is this the euphemism for blue balls the
athletes lifting he's like you trying to
get pussy's a't think about coach
like Boom blue ball you think about
 now he's like yes God I am all
right so we're doing some deadlifts the
range of motion isn't that great the
athletic application of deadlifts is
relatively low the velocity of the
movement is not very high if you want
better power production you would do
variations of cleans especially the
second pole handang cleans power cleans
Etc that would be much better choice um
if we wanted overall strength and
development M we would choose something
that had more range of motion like a
deficit deadlift the hack bar is really
just a lot of times so people can lift a
lot of weight and feel quite good about
it it has its applications but uh wildly
exaggerated it's kind a weird space
between the weights there to make it
look like there's more weights on the
bar where there's really not that much
weight uh all right let's find out what
the ball is for okay no
way yo motherucker got balls cuz like
I'm not a black man but if I was a black
man and some white was
putting a big blue ball on my face while
I was trying to lift I'd be like big
homie nah up off of me bro what the f is
the point of this oh don't worry Joel's
probably outlined it trap bar 90 degree
Ecentric isometrics plus neck
perturbation training with Swiss
ball for most folks perturbation to
trunk or upper torso will suffice thank
God thank God I thought I was going to
have to get neck balls or whatever for
contact athletes this version is
beneficial to prepared athlete how to
absorb impact to head and
neck Joel you ever play a contact sport
bro so I compete in Brazilian jiu-jitsu
I wrestled in high school I've seen a
few folks play American football every
now and again the degree of force
involved in perturbing the head and neck
is a tiny bit higher than you're doing
with the ball and generally speaking
it's going to come from vectors and
directions that are best simulated well
in training not in the weight
room where you just want to make their
necks and everything strong under normal
conditions good side to side up back and
forth loaded Network like almost every
football player does is a very good idea
this tap in the bosu ball
 I have no idea what the's for
oh no wait wait I do three if you guys
are liking this we have way more unrated
content in our members section
specifically content we couldn't include
in this video because it was so
salacious the sensors would hurt us I
don't know anyway give the membership uh
a thought and there'll be cool stuff in
there all right what are we doing we got
a kettle bell we got
titties you've not tried 90° Ecentric
isometrics oh oh I see the Centric is
when the muscle lengthens as you're
Contracting it the isometric is when the
muscle doesn't change in length as
you're Contracting it so them together
is a contradiction in terms so it's not
a real thing try again Joel try again if
you've not tried 90° centc metrics I
highly recommend them because I promise
you with proper implementation something
you'd have to learn from him of course
they'll transform your body and your
training not sure how everyone who tries
them swears by them everyone that's how
you know it's aing lie guys guess the
fraction of people that have been
satisfied with RP products I don't know
what it is but sure isn't 100%
there are people out there that hate RP
there are people out there that use our
products got bad results why because
it's the real world now we've helped a
lot of people but real products don't
give you magic results if you say some
 like everyone who tries them
Squares by them I know for a fact you're
a liar Joel seedman that's right you
mother I ain't talking to anybody else F
when you use your body the way God
intended it to be your
kidding God's like all right Moses MOS
hey Moses Moses jot this down
Moses is like all right God's like Thou
shalt not kill Moses is like dope got it
fire don't covet your neighbor's wife
and unless you got big ass titties
like this then you're good all right oh
and like move like I intended or
whatever and and Moses didn't just write
that down he was like 90° Ecentric
isometric got it God's like all right
all right see you in a couple years he
get out of here go walk around the
desert 40 years some like that and
I would know this cuz I'm a Jew
and I think are we are we posturing Joel
seedman might also be a tribe member bro
I'm telling you man I hope man it's
about to get racist and I ain't
even trying to say it but like when
other racial groups do some weird
I'm like whatever you know what I'm
saying happens when Jews do some
weird because they my people
different different standard your boy
get angry anyway when you use your body
the way God intended it to be used this
is very well documented of course how he
intended it uh it literally literally
not figure l so the following is a
literal claim brings healing and
restoration okay when you operate
outside these boundaries the opposite
occurs my 600 page book movement
redefined also explains in detail does
the book site God directly I
wonder over the last 10 years I've
trained hundreds of pro athletes where
we've used almost exclusively 90 degree
joint angles the results have been
nothing short of miraculous has there
have been zero lower body injuries
Ste
stock water into wine dope one loaf of
bread into a shitload of food far
sweet that Mulan did in that one
movie where she like up the whole
Mongolian Army I thought that was
Miracle having trained hundreds of pro
athletes zero lower body injuries
interesting Claim by the way almost
certainly wrong I've heard people I
train
before sorry
happens and they all got amazing results
miraculous results Joel hold up I'm
gonna do this for you pimp nobody done
it
before a round of applause Joel C Joel
Ceda everybody fire
trainer my man miraculous you guys I
have a big ass ego you will never hear
me say some as miraculous that I'm
doing what the large range of
motion or end range training is not only
myth but it's counterproductive of
course it is you don't want to get the
best hypertrophy results and the best
joint resilience through a full range of
motion actually inoculating you from
injury to a large extent I don't know
you want to go for something arbitrary
like 90° but make sure I sound stable
too so people get to lift as much
egotistically based weight as they can
while simultaneously not lifting too
much weight because they offset it with
the instability so they can feel proud
of lifting a substantial amount of
weight but also be like aha but the
instability makes it even harder so
you're actually keeping them very
unlikely to be hurt because it's not
enough weight to hurt them but also
you're keeping them way outside the
range where they get their best
adaptations because the instability
doesn't allow you to produce the
necessary forces to get your best
adaptations fullprof system of total dog
 and by the way how long did it take
Joel to tie a fing band around every
single one of those weights how the does
anybody that like that's like 40 minutes
of work mother you doing with this with
your clients be like hey what exercise
are we doing next like Jim take a water
break we'll going be here for 20 minutes
I'm going to set up your next now
don't worry nobody's going to be using
this rack this just me and you man I'm
just going to tie 18 bands around my
 and then we'll see what happens
yeah just a lot of weights and banss on
the for no freaking reason at all
no good reason at all nobody's enhancing
the sport performance on the margins
better than with traditional lifting
doing this but I think Joel Sean's plan
is to do wacky to become known for
wacky to convince some fraction of
the population that wacky works
better than regular and because
he's the king he's the domain owner of
wacky he convinces you that like
this is what you need and then you you
get into a funnel and you start buying
his you subscribe to his newsletter
whatever he has and buy his stupid ebook
and all this other dumb I'm
bringing violence today fellas I've had
enough charlatan nonsense ain't no more
Nuance left in this mother you Joel
seedman and if you see me in the street
hello but also we could get a popping
I'm kidding that's illegal but if you
got a problem bro you know what I'm
saying I'm joking of
course the all
right
folks what Joel here is doing is called
is engaging and now he has a decent
amount of weight on the bar so what is
that 170 kilos pretty good and he's
standing on a bosu ball and so he is
generating an inordinate about of in uh
an inordinate amount of instability
the thing is you lift heavy in order to
recruit as many parts of your muscles
and nerves as possible so that you can
train with the highest level of force
production and those High forces are
would give you all the gains you see
that's why you put the heavy weight on
your back for high forces if you put a
decently heavy weight on your back like
he's doing but then radically
destabilize the movement by standing on
a wobbly surface you're taking much of
the effect of that heavy weight and just
completely throwing it out the window
because if you pair moderately heavy
weight to a high degree of instability
much of your musculature doesn't even
turn on because your body is in a sense
too afraid to turn on all of your
muscles really jam into that uh bosu
ball have one of your feet slip out and
you catastrophically get hurt which if
happen to Joel seedman it would think
just be really funny I'm kidding sort of
I'm kidding but it's funny um but if
you're an athlete trying to get the best
combination of strength and the best
combination of training under
instability I would tell you to do two
things one is train them separately and
two question why you're training
instability at all where in a sport
world do you encounter uneven surfaces
that wobble what sport is that
trampolining no still uneven surface
doesn't really wobble much either I
don't
know that's what this
is good what the is this B
stance
row nope
D
stance stiff legged deadlift too combo
with bands around your elbows and I'm
doing like Einstein math equations to
find out what the is going on there
drop bar kickstand bent over Rose and
RDL that's what you call it Billy hey
coach what exercise are we doing oh no
worries buddy trap bar kickstand bent
over row plus RDL be like who that's a
lot of exercise is like ah this just one
you could stop at five or six stores or
just
one ntl Loop code seedman sorry seedman
15 you guys know pen 15 the pen 15 Club
write pen 15 on your on your hand with a
a regular pen it doesn't wash off it'll
be funny band cues more direct lat and
back activation plus posture it's
important to work on everything all at
the same time if you start trying to
work on everything at the same time you
grade the value of anything in specific
and since for especially good athletes
they need to go to extremes to get
better at any one thing if you try to
work on everything it dilutes the
training stimulus so much that now
you're probably just accumulating
fatigue and not getting any better if
this gentleman at his advanced level of
athletic ability needed to make his back
stronger he'd have to put himself in a
real stable position really pull limit
weights if you wanted to work on his
posture it'd have to be doing nothing
but working on his posture and being
attentive to it maybe in a balanced
situation if he wanted to do an RDL and
to Target the hamstrings he would have
to have a lot more weight on the bar
bigger range of motion big mind muscle
connection not have to worry about 50
other things at the same time because it
dilutes the quality of stimulus imagine
that if Elon Musk was having a a talk
with his accountant a talk with his
developer of various Auto Driving
Systems and a date with his wife
girlfriend main whatever has
season Time of the Season type of
at the same time while talking to fans
at his dinner table how much do you
think he would
accomplish I assume nothing how much is
accomplishing here I assume also nothing
safety squat bar and trap bar deadlift
combo so not only do you have the weight
above you you have the weight below you
as well this is what we call needless
complexity that accomplishes I'm not
sure what but don't worry Joel
knows there you go stay tight you got
this come
on yep nice good
Chris oh
yeah one more one
more y great
job word
up Scott the video guy just said this
could go on for a long time and thank
God it's not
folks how do I put this
in a nice way I have two ideas for
what's going on one idea is that Joel
seedman is a nice well-meaning guy and
he just got caught up in his own we
all do I'm caught up my own too
he's believing he drank the
Kool-Aid and he's bringing people into
the crowd he just doesn't know any
better maybe and then Joel I I'm saying
it's all jokes on here baby it's all
love please feel free to learn Real
Sports Science anytime it's it's just
tutor bumpa and uh and Hof they got a
book called periodization just buy it
just read that good
start there's another possibility all
sorts of intermediate universes between
them and that possibility is that Joel
seedman is lying to you on purpose that
he wants you to subscribe to his
community of wacky and the
wacky is what sets him apart
because nothing else seems to set him
apart because he doesn't actually know
that many things nor he that Jab nor has
he trained people that are so impressive
as to give him really good reviews or
all those things could be true on the
margins but he wants more and much like
Dr Oz who was an award-winning heart
surgeon before he began to be a
professional fing liar BB Joel is
getting into that game if that's true
come on
Joel stop but if you don't want to stop
we going to make fun of you all the way
through the so the rating here on
Joel gets a 12 out of 10 on actual value
it's a neg five out of
600 and uh I'm going to go SLP my wrists
see you guys
never all right that was fun folks if
you want more hilarious knowledge or
something this video right here YouTube
thinks you should click on it and
generally we tend to
[Music]
