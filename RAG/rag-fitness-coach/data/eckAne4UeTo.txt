you know
legs are a little more even all right
folks
workout number 10 of our mass gaining
sample week p.m
saturday shoulders biceps forearms
we're starting with shoulders first
because the other two workouts have
started with biceps so we're giving
shoulders a little bit more priority
this time
they're first second is biceps lastus
forms because if you do forearms first
everything's forms after the limiting
factor we're super systemically fatigued
jared and i are going to grind through
this workout this is the time to step up
and do what it takes
multiple sets close to failure with good
technique we have to finish strong
we're not rolling the half the car in
the tire through the finish line
we're blasting through it charlie is so
messed up he's not even going to be in
this video
he has to do his work out later because
he's too systemically fatigued to
actually be here which is a thing
so for the survivors
let's get started and let's finish
strong
all right first exercise is superset
slightly bent
lateral raises target the side delts a
bit of rear delts and then right after
slightly bent
barbell bent over rows first set is
going to be roughly
between 20 and 30 reps and the second
set is going to be
something like 5 to 10 maybe up to 15.
uh really good way to get in a lot more
volume
once the side belts are hammered from
the lateral raises they are going to be
the limiting factor in the upright rows
which makes this a great
side delt exercise probably about four
sets here
because four sets here is really like oh
i don't know six sets worth of stimulus
because there's a superset
uh yeah i'm scared to do this
it's gonna hurt
[Music]
[Applause]
give me
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
all right folks bicep exercise
another sort of super set seated bicep
curls
with the 30s right in to see the bicep
curls for 20s
this allows a bit more metabolites
orchestration
a bit more volume and a bit more times
approaching failure
in one exercise so we're probably gonna
do three sets here
that's a total of six failure approaches
not bad
um we're not super emphasizing biceps in
this workout that was the other workouts
so a little bit easier but still good
stimulus
let's get it done
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hey folks we are a lit tired as the
french say
we lit tired forearm
wrist curls standing dumbbells
it's hard to determine failure on these
because you can kind of keep wrist
curling with just a little bit more up
so just be honest when you get a really
big pump when the burn is really extreme
and when you can't really do the justice
to a real true full wrap
stop uh you don't need to grind on these
because you can just do another set
uh they're not very systemically
fatiguing so you can do a lot of sets
you know you've done a good job when
your forms are pumped beyond control
it's hard to grip things and you're good
after this we're gonna sign off
let's do it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
oh we're on camera hey folks we
ended up doing a drop set
forms why not there was uh
six total sets one uh set with the 40s
there
30 reps i got and then all the others
were eight about five seconds rest
between
tough effective that is our last workout
of this week now that you guys have seen
all these videos
you can see what a typical week of high
volume hypertrophy training looks like
this is our peak week essentially so
uh things are you know one two zero rar
depending on the lift
uh remember everyone's zero rir looks
different some people can grind ground
grind some people know when their
zero rer is coming up and they
intelligently stop beforehand
don't uh compare yourself too much in
general
do your best your best technique your
best range of motion for whatever
has the highest stimulus to fatigue
ratio for you
start pretty far off from failure
incrementally get closer push yourself
put a little bit of weight on the bar a
few extra reps here and there
more sets if you need them fewer if you
don't
and uh stacking multiple workouts
multiple weeks multiple months like that
together slowly over time patiently with
good nutrition etc
that is how you gain muscle and uh
best of luck to you in your training
stay tuned for more content if you guys
want to see like
typical cutting phase training week
anything else
put in the comments below i'm learning
how to read english finally and maybe
i'll understand the comments at some
point
jared feather you got anything to say
about this whole week of training
shut up i hate that guy see you later
[Music]
yes
