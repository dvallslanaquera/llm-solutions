stop
one more go don't swing don't swing
bicep curl read enough with the drama
slow
chest up
[Music]
what's up YouTube me today I woke up
hoping I was someone else nope still
with Dr Mike
Jared feather wakes up every day covered
in his own Excellence the doctors say
they're working on that
read
saw this guy in the gym and he was like
hey I love your stuff follow you guys
lob lie I don't normally tune that stuff
out because you know what I'm saying a
lot of people come up to me and say Mike
man you're saying changed my life I was
like yeah whatever I draked him then he
took his shirt off and flex his biceps
in his back ass and I was like what and
they showed me a picture of what he used
to look like and I was like huh this is
crazy transformation and of course we
all know that there are two rewards for
an insane transformation one is the
reward of just living in an amazing body
which you now do two once you get to
train on the RP Channel and get put
through a really psychotic back workout
and wish you had never had a
transformation dream come true to me
sounds like a nightmare I love it
let's do it
[Music]
so first exercise is going to be
assistant pull-up Reed is 250 pounds and
we want to make sure
that he is able to do enough quality
repetitions to convey a good stimulus
that means minimum sets of five to ten
but we're going to focus on the quality
so he's probably gonna be doing sets of
10 to 15 in the assistant pull-up four
sets that means lots of stimulus pay
attention to the technique cues here
because they can change the assistant
pull-up into an actually super effective
exercise versus just pull ups for which
you get help more on that later let's
get to it Big Stretch do you keep
forceful
let's go good stuff
we got it
oh
two more
come on good one last one come up as
high as you can control these numbers
slow
[Music]
Big Stretch
unwrap
hell yeah man this is your last set with
this grip after we change grips yep and
it will give you a little less weight so
you can get a quality contraction let's
see if we can get a good technique here
five to ten reps okay come up as high as
you can for a split second and then
control The Descent
deep stretch yeah yeah stretch hold that
deep stretch all the way down
now yeah there you go
yes
two more come on man get height
small one last one nice and easy read
stretch yes
slow slow slow
two second stretch at the bottom
beautiful oh my God good stuff oh man
good bump now yeah bro
it's hard it's hard
Reed did two sets of slightly higher
position normal assisted pull-ups normal
grip medium grip now he's gonna do two
steps with a slightly lighter weight
going from 100 pounds of assistance up
to 145. he's going to do the parallel
grip and he's going to get a bigger
range of motion slightly more
repetitions he's tired so it's a down
set it's actually a similar just
slightly higher number of repetitions to
get more volume and a little bit of grip
variation that's going to be four
vertical pulling sets we're going to be
done with vertical pull we're going to
go in and do our rowing to make sure
that all of the general areas of the bat
get hit this is like a great overall
back workout it's going to be a total of
eight sets of back that is high quality
awesome number of sets if you train your
back two times a week even three times a
week that's a great amount of volume to
try with your own program
we've got big chest let's hear the sound
extension
yes yes
slow one last one coming up
whoa oh shit you got another one
so do you team stretch hold for a second
let it pull you apart
that's it slow slow stretch
unwracked hell yeah
oh shit
good shit
good shit
never thought the old lady machine would
be kicking my ass that's what people
think about it too yeah they're like why
would I use that well here you go good
effort yeah the thing you said about
like getting injured from those sets in
the past
I assume you didn't maintain that
restrictive technique with stuff you
know what I mean I'll try to but I need
to get to a head right point right so
just don't allow yourself to get to that
point exactly and you
just the same yeah but no injuries so
you'll grow a shitload but you won't
have those right shitty overusing
modifying like when you hurt your back
on bent rows I don't assume they were
touch the ground nice and slow come up
slow you know what I mean no it was
literally I finished my set on that shit
right I thought I could eke out two or
three more exactly that's when I did it
exactly yes you just don't let yourself
get to that point and you use the Robson
Reserve method right to kind of just
monitor your volume in that capacity
quick tip for the assisted pull-up in
the lighter sets you'll see that what
Reed is doing is pulling weight above
chest height so he's pulling all the way
down to the nipple line there's not
particularly a lot of cool muscle
activation lats Etc there's not a ton
that happens between here and here
except it sets us up to go so high that
you can engage eccentric resistance
to The Descent phase higher which means
your muscles get crazy eccentric load
all the way through a huge range we
essentially like are creating a bigger
glass with which to fill with eccentric
overloading milk I don't know where I
was going with that but you guys get the
idea if we pull really high we can
engage early really turn the lats on and
slowly control for a big stretch it
makes every rep quality you just don't
have to do that many reps if the range
of motion is really big
it's not the way to train that's a way
to train give it a thought on your own
training pull nice and high with low
handles and then on the way up don't
just drop as soon as you pull lock in
the lats and slowly let the machine peel
you apart you will feel a stimulus
one more come on big Power connect slow
last one except big stretch before full
stretch up oh no
oh my God
never gotten the shakes from a pull-up
huh bro
what the fuck was that are we doing more
at this grip if we only have that was
your last set here I think we're gonna
do flexion rows next okay how many know
those are yeah we'll show you
foreign
[Music]
okey dokey so four sets of assistive
pull-ups are done now we are going to do
barbell flexion rows with Reed the
target of the flexion row is the entire
complex of spinal erector musculature as
well as all the other polymusculature
the big thing here is to maintain a
rigid position then Flex at the spine
and as you row extend and touch for a
split second and hold at the tummy this
is going to light your back on fire if
you've done tons of other back movements
already even if it's just one this
rounds out all the back development and
really gets you super cooked up at the
end give it a shot if you go light which
we will since a 10 to 20 it's super safe
safe for the back no don't do 400 pounds
with this exercise right away or ever
and then you won't get hurt this is
going to be a good one and um do you
guys ever know like you're trying to do
your job at work and someone's just
standing next to you breathing heavy
it's annoying it's a public gym people
cover up not everyone wants to see
goddess body or whatever girl you even
in a bra don't answer that question
let's get the fuck up
hold slow you can come up higher arch
your whole back it'll be easier to hold
at the top
come up go row and leave yes and then
slow just the same way again Reid and
just the same way again we're in it for
the long haul keep going
boom I'm gonna slow on the way down Big
Stretch that stretch was rushed slow
stretch slow gentle touch up big chest
up yes you've got to stop at the top I
swear to God we'll cut this video off
let's go
big moves yes three more and you're done
Big Move slow slow stretch last one big
chest go slow
rack oh God
Jesus it's the heaviest 70 pounds ever
been in my life isn't that crazy so you
used to work in the strip club industry
yeah it was a hustler and then crazy
horses the reason that girls never come
up to the table that I'm at the strip
club is it because I'm ugly is it
because I smell is it because I have bad
breath or is it because I look poor all
four probably the money it's probably
his money they go to where they think
they see money okay what do I have to
dress up like to look like I have money
decent watch done done yeah
choose

did I feel that all the way down oh yeah
upper back all the way down through
lower back name a part of your back you
can't feel on this exercise
I don't know beautiful
you don't have to hold for that long but
that was great again
yes stretch
look forward keep your chest up as you
go yes just like that again
yes two more and you're done hold it
hold it at the top read to the stomach
up back to the stomach yes slow
hold slow
don't rack hold right there a little
lower
rack
ah
my gosh you can do barbell curls yeah it
doesn't hurt your elbows or anything no
Famous Last Words famous last words
[Music]
back is over Reed's back is crushed his
biceps could use a little bit more work
a lot of times what Jared and I like to
do is at the end of a back workout just
a couple sets of biceps it's not a ton
systemically fatiguing biceps are a high
frequency very easy recovering muscle so
if you're able to train biceps twice a
week on their own with some other muscle
groups here and there but if you have a
back workout you just put two or three
sets of biceps at the end maybe some are
at matching maybe a drop set on the
cable it's a really great way to Pepper
in more bicep stimulus because you can
never ever have big enough biceps we all
know this
check out the cues that Jared is going
to be giving to read how you execute
even a regular barbell curl is a big big
deal if you want the most longevity for
your training and to get the most
stimulus out of the smallest amount of
weight Jared take over curl forward
elbows forward and in forward and in
right here push them in a shitload feel
that and then lower from right there
keep your elbows here lower
all the way down all the way down all
the way down all the way down from right
here
and then up leave your elbows up front
as you go down okay
force them in towards each other as you
curl up
almost like you're doing a Twist curl
with the dumbbell like this supination
keep your chest up yes nobody's supposed
to be hard
good slow get those elbows in yeah
good slow
stop
one more go don't swing it's a fucking
bicep curl ring enough with the drama
slow
chest up
chest up
up
good Force those elbows in man elbows in
chest up in on the way up bullshit read
go all the way back down on stretch now
you gotta try a rep chest up only biceps
elbows in
Down Slow Down slow
what's up Jesus Christ
oh
oh
man the more stricter technique is the
closer to failure your biceps get sooner
I see so you don't have to do as much so
just really try to lose my technique
there just really try to keep them in
okay fuck the rep count
yeah as long as it's perfect you know
what I mean we don't need to count reps
but ideally
like we're using uh RP training app we
want to count reps to keep track of how
we're doing week to week so the reality
is first don't count reps just focus on
technique but the gold standard is to
focus so much on technique that you can
still count reps because every rep is
perfect and every rep counts we don't
want to not count reps because we're
like some of these are bad we want zero
bad reps eventually of course just for
first time training with us we're
sticklers a few reps are like not to our
liking but over time you want to become
a machine like when I train with Jared
Jared's a machine every rep looks the
same every rep is floss and if you can't
get another rep it just doesn't happen
so there's no fearing of getting the
failure failure is something that
happens that's awesome but we're gonna
only ever get to failure because we
demand so much of our technique that
like at some point you're just like
I'm like
yeah the purpose is not to complete the
rep the purpose is to execute the
technique big chest big chest big chest
yes
elbows in slow no swinging keep your
chest Up full full stretch full stretch
that's it rack Rack okay yeah
I got up and I was like that's not a set
oh fuck
it has to end sometime for everyone no
one can keep going
hell yeah
dude
humongous good stuff
why don't you tell YouTube folks how
this workout went hard as eight sets
I've ever done in one workout yes
um you did phenomenal your vascularity
is disgusting yeah and you shouldn't be
around children
okay but uh but uh but if you were the
children would have something to look up
to that was hulk-esque yes and that's
what's really important and that brings
us to the mission of our Channel we're
here for the kids Jared say something
you know about human children you
they come to the world you wipe their
butt with the white B
they shit everywhere and they puke
everywhere
