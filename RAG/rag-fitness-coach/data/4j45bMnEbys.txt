so between the potentiation set
and the working set I give myself about
two minutes
that's enough time
to Prime the nervous system put it in
layman's terms
for what's to come
uh I've talked about this in many many
places
Nick's channel the other day I talked
about it
but you'll notice oftentimes people are
like man set two felt really really good
um
set one was a little shaky
most people just try to go into their
working sets right away instead of
priming the nervous system with the
potentiation aspect of this of the
workout of the final set of the warm-up
so try it out next time you train see if
you like it you can even go like five
percent over your working weight so if
you have one working weight let's say I
went to maybe 315 instead I did a couple
then I backed down to 280 and that's
when I go into my working sets probably
feel pretty damn easy after that so try
it out see if you like it
maybe you don't
