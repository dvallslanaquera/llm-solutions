hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization muscle gain dieting made
simple
video number 10 the last one of the
series getting exotically huge
what i thought that was just a category
in adult film searches
in any case last time in video number
nine
we took you through a tour and in video
nine it was a nine video tour
of the entire process of muscle gain
nutrition
and now you have the basic tools to get
bigger
but what if you want to get exotically
big and the definition we're going to be
working here is
sort of within 95 of your genetic
potential under
nearly ideal circumstances
well we have a few tips for you first
it's not for everyone okay
there's literally no good reason to do
it outside of art
okay i had a fun chat with eric helms
once where i sort of described he's like
you know why are you
doing all this to yourself and getting
super super massive
he didn't quite phrase it like that but
it came up and i was like you know
it's art to me like it's just like i get
a
crazy chest and tricep pump and i'm
pretty lean and i flex in the mirror and
i'm like fuck
this is like inspirational shit it's
just amazing like you're your own action
figure
you know action figures or toys they're
fucking useless so it was most of this
shit except for flexing around
it helps me in jiu jitsu or whatever but
if i wanted to be the best jujitsu
athlete i would train quite differently
i wouldn't be as muscular i'd be more
tech to go faster etc etc
so if someone is like man i'm not
motivated to get big
and you're like okay like do you want to
get bigger they're like not really
like why the fuck are you getting big
right it's a self-solving
problem it's a self-answering question
if you really want to get big
just understand it's for its own sake
and
it comes with health downsides for sure
even for naturals
pushing the very top end of their
genetic size abilities means gaining a
lot of weight
and potentially times plenty of fat it's
not unhealthy like to the point where
it's just going to drop you down at age
50
but it comes with some trade-offs for
sure some trade-offs
so just understand that just understand
that and and if you know that and you're
okay with it then fine
but really think it through next if you
really want to sign up for this it takes
years
okay for most people to get remotely
close to the true potential
it takes about 10 years of training and
10 consistent years okay if you don't
like the process of training don't
bother so i will say a huge public
service announcement
if you don't like dining or eating with
a purposeful plan and intent
if you don't really like training or
it's really like a battle for you
just go do something else okay like
you know elon musk is he jacked who the
fuck knows who cares he doesn't fucking
care
uh you know is is shaquille o'neal
jacked
no but he's worth like 400 million
dollars he's a fucking legend right
being jacked is cool for its own sake
and that's just about it
so if you're not willing to commit to 10
years and you don't like the process you
don't have a deep sense of enjoyment
from it
do it for maybe a little couple of
months longer and try to really get a
feel for it if something you really want
to do but if it's not gelling fuck it
right no sane rational person ever
judges you for not being jacked
okay it's not like i myself and other
bodybuilders that are pretty jacked walk
around airports and like
look at this book and normies bro like
what the fuck like those people are
probably great people or maybe not maybe
i'm not a great person who knows right
so it has to be you have to love the
process or at least like the process
if you're going to survive to that
rarefied air right how many people
that climb mount everest and get to the
top don't like mountain climbing
huh maybe zero maybe one or two ever for
the love of god
right it's gotta be something you like
to do other physical activities tend to
interfere
in a scaled way and we have other videos
about this with the
pursuit of exotic hypertrophy exact
bodybuilder so if you really love rugby
or real love wrestling or real life
tennis
you might have to give summer all of
that up for some time maybe for good
if you want to push that exotic boundary
and if you don't want to give them up
fuck it
right but just know that it's going to
take trade-offs really big ones
and of course over that time you should
be aiming to move your body weight up
slowly
and it gets really really hard you do
not get
to 280 and jacked by
not eating a fuckload of food and a lot
of times
for months and years when you don't want
to eat it and it
you're going to be uncomfortable seat
belts will fit weird and getting in and
out of car
sucks and sleep will get weird and
you'll start snoring and also the
crazy garbage it blows and gets really
hard but you got to fight through if you
want to be
jacked i'm just here to tell you it's
not all sort of roses and bunny rabbits
there are some downsides to it
now we said in a few slides ago
nearly ideal circumstances it takes like
10 years what does that mean
that means plenty of sleep on almost
every night
stress management on point don't freak
out for no reason all the time that will
not get you jacked
nutrition almost always on point no
disappearing for months on end you'll
see promising bodybuilders that maybe
get the pro card or
maybe did a local show in one and people
were like oh this guy's coming for
nationals
and like oh where is he at nationals and
he doesn't compete that year and then
next year he sort of starts training
again
like what happened like it got kind of
demotivated or a lot of times you'll
follow bodybuilders instagram
they won't post anything instagram for
like two or three weeks and they'll make
a post like first workout in a while
had some drama with my girl but it's all
settled now it's like what the fuck are
you a child
right if you are an adult who is
endeavoring on becoming jacked you have
to have an adult lifestyle
you know how like you made fun of your
parents when you were a kid and they all
you know
you you were 13 and you wanted to stay
up with your friends till midnight and
your friends were like fine but we're
going to sleep and you're like
fucking losers like mom and dad actually
productive citizens they actually have a
job and you're fucking useless you go to
school
and produce almost nothing adults
produce okay
and the production of muscle requires an
adult-like lifestyle
one time they asked jay cutler what he
was gonna do after one of his olympia
wins
and he's like yeah i'm gonna gonna get a
little crazier than normal i usually go
to bed at nine
so i'm gonna go to bed at 11 tonight
what was jay cutler
right how are you going to beat that guy
other than ronnie coleman
and towards the end of his career phil
heath nobody ever really did
right so that's the thing you can't just
disappear you can't be inconsistent you
got to be consistently smart
and hard at training and dedicated to
diet and every little piece of the
puzzle if you really want to take a shot
at this that's the best way to do it
now last but not least
full transparency the biggest guys in
the world are on lots of drugs
okay the occasional guy takes very
little very few drugs to get big most
the guys that you see in the magazines
are on like
unreal cocktails okay here's the thing
drugs aren't magic
okay you can absolutely spot a natty
on the interwebs and the youtube
comments on the red at any time
when they say yeah man just book and
take glenn and tren and var and you'll
fucking blow up
like bullshit you've never taken in
those things and pushed hard enough
they're like well yeah i mean i haven't
but i know how it works don't be fine
don't
first of all you're only listing
compounds that you've read about on the
internet you never never see masteron or
primo reference there's very rarely
a bunch of other drugs people just sort
of miss like npp
you never see a regular guy in there
gonna talk about mp3 where the fuck is
mpp google it
and you'll find out like oh what the
hell is that well if you don't know then
you probably have never done a whole lot
of drugs okay
so you really gotta watch out from the
people that say like fucking drugs are
magic they'll do whatever you want
drugs are highly inconvenient to take
they're annoying as fuck
they really take a massive toll on your
health and the more of them you take the
bigger the toll
tons of massive trade-offs for what an
average of enhanced results that
continue to get incrementally slower
over time
it's not like when people say dumb shit
like yeah you gotta worry about rar and
shit like that and volume unless you're
on drugs then it's whatever
bullshit it's not whatever it's just
more expanded
so if you know you used to have to be
really really precise with your training
and you started taking drugs
now you can be less precise and get the
same results who the fuck takes drugs to
get the same results
you want better results so now you get
precise again and then years later you
gotta get real precise
you know it's not like phil heath is
prepping for mr olympia and he's like
i'm on drugs fuck it cheeseburgers no
way his diet's like super super
strict because everything has to be in
place for exotic
okay if you want to be a regular guy at
a club who has plenty of muscle
and eats whatever he wants yeah drugs
will get you there at a fucking terrible
expense to your health
you'll be one of those guys that puts
instagram posts at age 36 and being like
in the hospital again doc says hearts
giving out i'm going to have to fucking
do a gofundme
you don't want to do anything shit if
you're ever going to take a shot
at the pharmacology side of things i
have a few tips for you
first just don't fucking do it it's
probably not worth your time
legit you're the average person it's not
worth your time if you really really
insist
only do it under a few conditions first
if it's legal in your country
okay so as far as i'm aware in the
united kingdom for example
anabolic drugs for the most part are
fine to use for personal use and possess
you're not allowed to distribute them
that's illegal but you're fine to use
go to town tons of countries in the
world when that's fine doctor's
prescription totally fine
okay second point do not do them by
yourself okay don't be like i'm in
reddit and
i bought anavar i took it and things
happened okay you have no fucking idea
what you're doing
a lot of people have done that and paid
huge price for it or just pissed away
gains or
pissed away a lot of money you want
supervision of a
coach and or a doctor if you need a very
good start
as to that type in team evil gsp on your
old instagram there or anywhere on the
google
and you'll find a whole lot of resources
behind intelligent approaches to that
sort of thing
okay and there's tons of other people
that can help get a coach and work with
a medical doctor to make sure you're
good to go
and the doctor supervising means you get
regular blood work
next point i highly recommend this is
just person to person
don't do it until you're over age 25 if
it's legal in your country
why because up to age 25 motherfuckers
graduated high school like a few years
ago
you're still putting on a ton of natural
quality muscle okay
and to be honest up until age 25 your
brain is not sufficiently mature and you
haven't had enough
wisdom built up to make really good
decisions big decisions
impactful decisions like the choice to
take special sports supplements or not
when i was age 25 fuck all did i know
what i was doing with my life
now mind you i was like a genius whiz
kid or whatever bullshit i was really
good at tests
but looking back to the kind of shit i
thought when i was like 24 23
i was a sharp kid but i made all kinds
of fun crazy mistakes so
if i had to start like i know guys who
started taking drugs when they were like
16
holy fuck thank god i did not have
access to that or thought it was a good
idea or whatever
confluence of variables kept me away
from that age 25
like here's the thing if you're not
making consistent gains up to age 25 and
you need drugs to get you anywhere
don't take drugs at all because you're
not gonna amount to shit when you take
drugs if you weren't shit natty
if you're pretty fucking jack natty you
may go places when you take drugs
if you're a dog shit natty what are
drugs gonna do unless you're the one in
a thousand
crazy outlier that drugs just spark this
new generation of growth
you're just going to have you're going
to be a guy who takes a lot of drugs and
people like you daddy right you're like
no but i guess i look natty you don't
want to be that guy
age 25 makes your means you're mature
means you've put in the work
and you've proven to yourself that like
i'm going places natty 25
maybe after 25 i can go places not natty
and
lastly only after about eight years
minimum
of natural training because you're still
getting really great results
if you can put on ton of muscle ninety
percent of the muscle you ever put on
uh or 90 of your natural potential natty
that's amazing when you hop on or
whatever if that's your choice you
already have a ton of muscle you put on
a really healthy way without any side
effects or worries or bullshit or costs
then you could just lay your cake on top
of that but some guys like i
legitimately know people that started
lifting they were 140
when they got to 145 pounds they started
using drugs
where does that train even go that's
fucking crazy if you could have gotten
to 180
off drugs oh my god this guy's the limit
but a lot of people start way too early
and it's really really fucking stupid
and i 100 will judge the fuck out of you
if i meet you in your life and you've
been training for two or three years and
using drugs
outside of very special circumstances
you have like super low endogenous
testosterone
i'll give you the squint hmm all right
so those tips are about all i have do
your best
if you want exotic size be consistent
be patient and no matter your muscle
size
enjoy the journey and enjoy yourself
enjoy being alive
because getting big only guarantees
that you'll get big and be big it does
not guarantee happiness
i know a lot of folks who get in to the
muscle game
you know we all fight off our demons and
that's why we're in the gym and that's
totally cool
and they go in there for a variety of
different reasons i'm gonna get girls
girls actually just
mostly date skinny hipsters that have
confidence and talent don't give a fuck
uh you know if you have all those shits
you get you know what i'm saying you get
girls when you're jacked or when you're
skinny it doesn't really matter
being big will solve very few problems
for you outside of the problem of not
being big
and if you want it to make you happier
or get you laid more or anything else
like that
then uh you got to just go and look into
those things for yourself
if you want to get big for its own
fucking sake
the dedicated those of you who are
watching know exactly what i'm talking
about
that's all getting big is ever has to
get you right
see you next time and you better be
bigger peace
