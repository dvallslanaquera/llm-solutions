hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization breaking
through strength plateaus
video number three
periodic training reductions here we go
if you haven't seen the other two videos
in the series please do because they're
also super nice and i think they teach
you stuff
so
hard training
is a requirement in order to make
strength gains
but i'll say something that may be taken
is controversial but i think i can
substantiate it
relatively few people are
relatively few people that are serious
about their strength training
are stalling and plateauing because
they're not training hard enough
sometimes they are but it's an obvious
fix you just go harder right
and
people
love to backpack themselves i can't
reach my back my trap i'll have to do
for going hard
and
it's not often a problem right and in
strength training
it's not that hard to go hard because
the requisite volumes are pretty low so
you do like a couple triples and you're
like man fucking went at it today like
oh shit you did one and a half total
minutes of lifting whoop whoopty fucking
do most people who are you know really
pretty serious about strength training
they're grinding into the gym pretty
well at least in any given session it's
usually not a problem
now sometimes super
laziness can occur for a few days or a
few weeks and people hit little plateaus
but they're an easy fix they ramp things
up again pr's occur no big deal not
overly mysterious
however the opposite problem is probably
more common in serious strength trainees
exactly the kind of people that are
watching this video like you
not so many people don't train hard
enough
but tons of people train hard and hard
and harder and harder without ever
backing off which is a bad thing
how would you know
to back off well
we're on instagram and
snapchat or fuck swipe wherever you
young kids are hanging out nowadays
where are people telling you hey fucking
back off take it easy mostly nowhere
in what movies are people getting great
results by backing off like uh dragon
ball z
when goku and gohan came out of the
hyperbolic time chamber and goku was
like vegeta was like shouldn't you be
going back again to train again for
another few days and he's like nah we're
just going to more or less take active
rest this week and they just fucked
around and they got delayed adaptation
got way stronger i send it to super
saiyan 2 but other than dragon ball z
and maybe a few other weird anime nobody
watches that really just doesn't happen
most movies are like you fucking go
harder and that's it and because this
basically is nowhere to be said most
people don't know that backing off
is an important part of the process and
a lot of times they just don't ever do
it and and
there is a cultural heroism
about going hard and keeping going
uh like when you feel like crap you're
like supposed to push harder right like
you fucking get through the pain suck it
up when people said like uh they used to
say it wrestling all the time suck it up
i never really knew what i was supposed
to be sucking up i tell you what fellas
when i know what to suck up i suck long
and hard what
did i really mean that maybe i did
so people say other dumb shit like you
fucking make your best gains when you
push beyond your limits that's fucking
impossible your limits are as far as you
can push you make your best gains maybe
going close to your limits maybe two
year limits but beyond doesn't make any
goddamn sense
so there's a lot of this cultural lore
just hard hard heart at all times
and there's not a lot of cultural lore
even within the lifting community about
taking it easy and taking breaks and
because it sounds like a wussy thing to
do you're like oh like
really off days fuck that and
a lot of people get into this situation
where they train hard all the time and
never back off
now check this out
of course you're supposed to go hard you
have to push hard to make gains
but strength gains are a balance between
pushing hard
backing off to let fatigue decline and
then repeating and pushing hard again
tons of people just don't know about
that balance they're in the gym they're
pretty serious and they think like the
harder i go the better and there's no
time for backing off
and they are never drilled in
also they sort of drill themselves into
the idea that the pushing part is the
important part
and they never hear much or enough in
many cases that the pulling back part is
just as important right
take it from me pulling out isn't
pulling back i don't even know what i'm
talking about pulling out is also
important
wear a condom folks come on now there's
stds out there covens probably an std
who the hell knows
cumulative fatigue
is also a thing
all right
a lot of people don't know that they
should be pulling back and what ends up
happening is they go hard and hard and
hard and their underlying ability to to
have strength their underlying fitness
is going up over time
but their fatigue also goes up and can
mask the fitness
when you're a beginner your fitness goes
up fast and because you're pretty
fucking weak your fatigue you're just
not able to do a whole lot of damage to
your body because you're fucking weak
you get strong really fast your fitness
goes up fast your fatigue doesn't go up
as fast and thus you continuously get
stronger and stronger and stronger the
difference between your fitness and your
fatigue is actually how strong you are
but often when people get to the
intermediate phase for the first time
their fatigue actually starts to catch
up to their fitness gains
and that eclipses their fitness
completely and they hit their first
plateau i would even be
i can go so far as to say
that a lot
a big fraction of people's first
plateaus are the first time they've
actually successfully been able to
accumulate enough fatigue to eclipse
their fitness gains not erase them the
fitness is still there under the hood
but you can't see it anymore you can't
express it you're not actually strong
because you're so goddamn beat up and so
tired if you only pulled back on
training for gee whiz even just a short
time your fitness would be very apparent
and it'd be like oh holy shit i really
did get a lot stronger but it can look
like a plateau if you never pull back
away from it
now
of course so so next question is
how do we bring down the fatigue because
obviously that's where we're going with
this
of course not ever going hard will
prevent fatigue from ever rising but it
also prevents you from ever getting
stronger so that's we wipe that off the
table
so
how do you let fatigue drop
in the context of still having hard and
consistent training and there are
essentially five ways to do it off days
technique only sessions technique only
half weeks deloads and active rest
phases we'll cover all these real quick
they're not that complicated so off days
if you're going hard
training six days a week
you might be accumulating so much
fatigue that one off day really doesn't
do a drop in the bucket and you're still
accumulating fatigue and you're
plateaued because your fatigue has risen
a bit faster than your fitness or at
least the same rate so you can't even
tell you got stronger
if you switch especially in strength
training which is super hardcore
uh to something like maybe only five
days a week of training all of a sudden
two consecutive days
drop much more fatigue week to week to
week and then your fitness stays ahead
of your fatigue for longer so you hit
more consistent prs and your plateaus
are not nearly as common nor maybe they
or don't occur at all for a long time
and then it's kind of problem solved
but people like to say shit like fucking
team no days off
i have a few things to say about that
it's fucking stupid it sounds dumb when
you fucking say it if you're saying it
sarcastically it sounds funny you're
saying it for real holy fucking shit
no good lifters don't take days off okay
i don't know any of them that are still
alive and by the way when you say team
no days off motherfucker you ain't on no
team
nobody likes you you don't have any
friends he's just something you put into
instagram and you cry a lot there's no
team no days off so stop doing that shit
take one day off at least every week and
maybe consider taking two or three days
off every week the quality of your
training will improve and then the
fatigue will reduce and you probably
will get through a plateau or maybe at
least
next technique only sessions
some lifts you can train multiple times
a week and you just get better and
better and better no big deal their
fitness improves and their fatigue drops
off and it comes up and then drops off
some other lifts
man in some situations or kind of all
the time you can only train them so many
times
so heavy deadlifting for example is
something you may be able to do once or
twice a week for many people it's just
once a week you try dead lift heavy
three times a week and you just go
straight to hell try it yourself nothing
good will happen
but
if you're training the deadlift it's a
huge technical component to it and a
huge sort of raw strength component
if we're only training deadlifts once a
week you kind of feel out of practice
every time you do it you're gaining good
strength but
maybe you could gain better strength by
deadlifting and still practicing the
movement but not going super hard in
other words you do a session for
deadlifting which is only the technique
but not the super super fatiguing
overload part
and it turns out that actually does work
so what you can do
is you deadlift on mondays and on
thursdays instead of doing hard each
time on thursdays you come in
you put something like seventy to eighty
percent of your one rm on the bar you do
set of just a few sets of two to four
reps with really really good technique
really focusing on practice
and you keep your rpe basically between
like three and six incredibly low
and that lets you improve your technique
as your fatigue doesn't stabilize it
actually falls during that time it's
like a mini deload for one session that
also improves your technique that can
change the fucking game big time and can
erase a plateau if you start doing
you can pre-program this to say every
monday i go hard and deadlift and every
thursday i go hard on the squat and i go
easy in the deadlift but it still helps
me with my technique it reduces fatigue
it's all it's all gravy it's all really
good or if you're supposed to go
incoming hard and you're like dude i'm
so beat up i'm so fucking tired there's
no way it's going to happen that doesn't
mean you just leave and go home
what you can do is instead of a planned
hard session like let's say
three mondays in a row you went hard on
the deadlift three thursdays in a row
you went easy on it next monday comes up
and you're like weird travel that
weekend your hips kind of sore you
didn't get enough sleep you're like dude
fuck i'm not hitting any pr's in this
session fucking just go down to
technique only seven eighty percent of
your one rep max and just a few sets of
like triples or something and what you
do is you get a ton of technique out of
it you reduce some fatigue and
when you come back and maybe do the same
thing thursday or maybe even on thursday
now you're recovering you go hard again
and voila major gains occur it's a thing
give it a shot it's a really really good
idea especially in a pinch but also in a
pre-programmed fashion
now you can have
a whole week of high fatigue and poor
performance is not just like one session
or here there
and maybe your cumulative fatigue is a
little too high too early maybe you have
four weeks of increasing difficulty and
then a deload week and by sort of the
middle of week three or the middle of
week two actually the end of week two
you're like really like i'm not gonna
get through four weeks of this shit i'm
not gonna hit all my planned pr's
this might happen just on one or two
lifts and it might happen on whole body
but what you can do is either take whole
body or a few lifts
and you do technique only sessions for
half a week
so basically if you train you know
monday tuesday thursday friday
this week monday tuesday went really not
well and you're really high fatigued
take thursday friday which would
normally be hard training sessions and
dial all the lifts back to the sets and
reps and the weight and the rpe of a
technique only session
after that half week oh my god you can
bring your fatigue down a ton it can
recharge you for at least a few more
weeks of productive training until you
make it to your deload take the whole
deload and then you're super crisp after
that and it allows you to do this
without taking a week off without taking
off days without having your technique
be a little rusty and with the ability
to actually improve your technique and
just keep getting better
with hypertrophy training if you're
curious that doesn't fucking work
technical training doesn't do dick to
make your muscles bigger so practicing
mostly unloaded rows doesn't make your
lats bigger but in strength training
just practicing the movement with low
loads and crisp technique can help make
you stronger so it's an amazing thing
strength training is actually kind of
easy you come in and if you're feeling
good you hit it hard and if you don't
feel good you hit it easy but with
technique and both improve you the hard
one improves you more but the easy one
still improves you better than zero and
it's an awesome awesome formula
of course
half weeks don't do justice to
everything each half week of deloading
or technique only probably buys you only
like another week and a half maybe two
weeks of really hard training and then
after that you just kind of degrade and
your joints will fall apart so at some
point you need um
a lot of rest and that's where deloads
come in you've probably heard of them
before
and
you essentially what is a deload there
are more complexities to it and we've
had tons of videos about those and we'll
have more in the future but essentially
it's like technique only sessions but
for an entire week or like oh half a
week of technique only sessions and then
just a week mostly off of the gym or
half a week off the gym once you do a
deload you restart your programmatic
cycle your new mesocycle and you ease
into harder and harder and harder
training and everything goes super well
a deload can reduce your fatigue back to
a workable amount close to zero
and recharge you for like four to eight
weeks of continuing accumulation which
means it's often the biggest
plateau killer of them all because again
most people's first plateaus sometimes
all plateaus result from too much
cumulative fatigue and a deal really
just washes that away like if you have a
lot of fatigue even a recovery half week
might just make you decent but it won't
make you super crisp but deload man it
washes away a lot of stuff and it can
really really really help you out and
just erase your plateau i would go so
far as to say
that most people in the general
community not the youtube strength niche
that we're in they don't even know what
a d-load is they just go
hard-heart-hearted and then like fuck
and they maybe take a week or two off
and they come back better but rather
than taking a week or two off you can
still do those technique only sessions
your technique is improving the entire
time so when you come back in the first
week after you might hit mega pr's
because you drop so much fatigue that
might be a thing and if you're
plateauing i would highly consider it
as a matter of fact i'll tell you guys
this
uh after asking folks like is your
nutrition recovery in order and after
asking them like are you really
plateaued or just making slow gains
probably one of the next things i do is
ask them what their deloading structure
is like and a lot of times i get like a
blank look like what do you like what do
you mean structure like do you deload
they're like what's that like sweet i
just solved your plateau for you you're
welcome take an easy week of training
like really that's not gonna make me
better when you explain fitness facial
dynamics get the same black stair you
just say hey like just fucking do it and
they do in there oh my god i'm hitting
pr's all the time super super great
d-loads go very far into producing
fatigue but sometimes they don't go far
enough especially in a few circumstances
if you've been training hard months and
months and months even taking deloads
you might be pretty beat up especially
if it's strength training especially
powerlifting competitive training really
fucks you up psychologically you're just
tired of giving it your all and that's
okay to admit out loud maybe just in the
quiet of your own home
and especially can take a you can take a
beating on joints and connective tissues
that's the thing that happens
and
sometimes it's you get generates aches
and pains which can prevent prs from
happening even though you have the
strength every time you lower your bench
press your shoulder feels kind of
fucking weird and painful and you're
like i don't know man i don't want to go
for pr because i don't know the fuck's
going on and i want anything to pop off
and that's a legitimate concern usually
doesn't happen after a few weeks and
even months of training but multiple
months in a row it can occur
so
what ends up happening is an active rest
may be in order an active rest is really
simple in in the
simplest way you do it is this you take
a de-load week like normal and then you
take a week of just living like a normal
person and just not even go to the gym
you know you walk around walk your dog
uh you know
sit on your porch and smoke cigars and
watch people walking by whatever it is
you do for fun stay at a wall that's
what i like to do
it's going to take all that training
fatigue and lower it almost to zero
you will lose some fitness just a tiny
little bit but that's going to recharge
your body for another half year or year
of training ahead
it should be done after most hardcore
powerlifting meets you should take a
deload that you probably took into the
meat and then you should probably take a
week off after every meet i would highly
recommend that and
otherwise if you're not powerlifting
you're training for strength i would say
you should take a de-load and then a
week off right after
them being together is good because it
really brings all the fatigue down as
opposed to them being separate um and a
lot of times the best time to do that is
like during the holidays like like
christmas time and shit
because you know like gyms are closed
and your family probably wants you to go
to baltimore to see your aunt like you
do every christmas and like fucking what
the fuck but you don't have to worry
about some shit uh no i will say
hilariously if you do happen to be in
the baltimore area exile fitness
um on pulaski highway actually is
one of the best gyms in the entire world
it's so big you won't be able to wrap
your mind around it they have like six
of every different machine from every
different era they have like hack squats
from the fucking 1970s 80s 90s and three
modern ones it's nuts but any case if
you happen to be in baltimore on the
earth your aunt maybe you're in another
city that doesn't have one of the
world's best gyms and it's a good time
to just take a break and that's awesome
go on vacation go with your family go
with your friends go alone and stare at
a wall uh those kinds of things are
great because you will become much
better after and a lot of times you'll
smash through all your plateaus
if you think that real athletes don't
take time off
almost all the best russian power
lifters i've ever met i've know plenty
of them in person and talked to them and
all on russian and shit like that they
take like one or two months off every
year off of training and supplements and
everything after their big world-class
competitions and then they ease into
training after for the rest of the time
and compete a bunch of times and then
win stuff and then take another one to
two months off ronnie coleman the king
after he won the olympia and then he did
the european tour which was like two or
three weeks after he won all those shows
too
he would take one to two months off
often two months off of training
altogether he just maybe trained
recreationally like get a little pump or
maybe nothing at all
no supplements diet just whatever he
wanted just keep the protein decent and
that was it okay that's ronnie coleman
he won eight mr limbus it's more common
for high level athletes to take plenty
of time off than it is for them to be
psychotic and never take time off so
team no days off it will if it was a
team would be a fucking shitty team
so in conclusion
training makes you stronger by incurring
adaptations but it also leads to the
accumulation of fatigue
by pulling back on occasion sometimes in
smaller ways like off days and technique
only sessions sometimes in bigger ways
like technique half weeks and deloads
and active rests
you can make sure your cumulative
fatigue is both not rising too fast and
also when it rises is occasionally
brought down and thus is not holding you
back
and then if you're still struggling with
gains and you're still plateaued you can
rule out cumulative fatigue as a problem
and focus on the more detailed aspects
of your training though i will say
i've seen a lot of lifters worry about
the super details like it might do in
too many sets of five and out of six
shit like that is my bench like this or
something like that and you get them to
actually do a deload or an active rest
and it turns out that they they make
mega prs for months after that and the
cumulative fatigue was the problem so
it's a thing that is uh responsible for
a huge fraction
of failing uh to pr and if you address
it and the funny thing is it's the
easiest thing to address in the world
because you do less and you get more
if
and when those folks deload no more
plateau and in your case that might be
the case too give it some thought in any
case don't think about it for longer
than a week because i'll see you again
in a week with the next installment of
this series peace
