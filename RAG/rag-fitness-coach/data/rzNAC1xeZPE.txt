the barbell bench press is probably the
most popular upper body exercise
in this exercise the muscles of the
chest are considered a prime mover
but how good is the bench press at
developing the chest
could you perform only the barbell bench
press for the rest of your training
career
an experience close to or even maximal
chest growth
in this video we aim to answer this as
best as possible through evaluating the
current research
first it's useful to establish what we
mean by the muscles of the chest
and what movements best recruit this
musculature from there
we can analyze the movements that occur
in the barbell bench press
with the hope of deciding if this
exercise is indeed ideal
for engaging the chest muscles that
connect the thorax
to the shoulder and upper arm are the
chest muscles
this includes the pectoralis major
pectoralis minor
subclavius muscle and the serratus
anterior
we will only be discussing the
pectoralis major this muscle covers the
large bulk of the chest
and all the research we will evaluate
has specifically addressed this muscle
besides i think when most discuss the
chest muscles
they are referring to the pectoralis
major the pectoralis major
as with all muscles in the body creates
movement via its attachments to bones
when a muscle dynamically contracts the
attachments remaining stationary are
called the origin
while attachments that move are called
the insertion
the pectoralis major has a range of
origins
the medial clavicle sternum ribs
the cartilage of those ribs and the
apnerosis of the external
oblique all the muscle fibers of the
pectoralis major
insert into generally the same location
the lateral side of the upper arm
so this is the insertion it is common to
split up a muscle based on muscle fibers
sharing the same origin location
with the pectoralis major there is no
universal agreement on these divisions
some consider the pectoralis major to
have three heads a clavicular head
consisting of fibers originating from
the medial clavicle
a sternal head consisting of fibers
originating from the sternum
and a coastal head consisting of fibers
originating from the ribs
their costal cartilages and the
apnearosis of the external oblique
the clavicular head is often called the
upper chest
the sternal head of the middle chest and
the costal head
the lower chest however others consider
the pectoralis major to have only two
heads
a clavicular head consisting of fibers
originating from the medial clavicle
and a sternocostal head consisting of
fibers originating from the sternum
ribs coastal cartilages and the
aponeurosis of the external oblique
in further support of this division the
clavicular
and sternocostal head have distinct
nerve supplies
remember the reason muscle fibers
contract
is because they receive signals from
nerve cells the clavicular head fibers
generally receive
signals from the lateral pectoral nerve
the sternocostal head generally receives
signals from the medial pectoral nerve
so what movements engage the pectoralis
major
during horizontal flexion the pectoralis
major
and anterior deltoid are heavily
involved
from around 0 to 10 degrees of
horizontal flexion
the anterior deltoid has slightly better
leverage than the pectoralis major
but from 10 degrees up to 140 degrees of
horizontal flexion
the pectoralis major has the greatest
leverage during shoulder flexion
the sternal head but substantially more
so the clavicular head
is involved interestingly at high
shoulder flexion angles
the costal head seems to play a role in
shoulder extension
i should note although the clavicular
head is going to be involved in shoulder
flexion to a good degree
the anterior deltoid has the greatest
leverage throughout this motion
meaning it is probably going to be more
activated
during shoulder adduction the sterno and
costal heads appear to be moderately
involved
but the latissimus dorsi and teres major
are likely activated substantially more
during this motion
conversely the clavicular head appears
to be involved a small amount
in shoulder abduction from 40 degrees of
shoulder abduction and onwards
however the anterior deltoid and
especially lateral deltoid
are likely activated substantially more
during this motion
therefore shoulder adduction or shoulder
abduction exercises
are probably not ideal for the
pectoralis major finally
the pectoralis major as a whole appears
to be highly involved in
internal rotation
do any of these movements occur during
the bench press
it turns out all of these movements but
shoulder adduction or abduction
occur to a good degree in the barbell
bench press the degree of horizontal
flexion
is determined by the grip width used as
grip width remains unchanged throughout
a barbell bench press
so does the degree of horizontal flexion
if you perform the exercise with your
wrist
elbows and shoulders aligned before the
descent phase
90 degrees of horizontal flexion is used
some research indicates the pectoralis
major
has its greatest leverage at roughly 40
to 50 degrees of horizontal flexion
roughly this probably equals anywhere
from a 1.5 times to a two-time
shoulder-width grip for most people
theoretically this grip width may be
optimal for pectoralis major development
viewing the barbell bench press from the
side a correct descent results in the
somewhat diagonal line once the barbell
is at its lowest position
the distance between your shoulders and
the barbell indicates how much shoulder
flexion must occur
during the ascent phase the longer this
distance
the more shoulder flexion required as a
note
descending the barbell to the mid-chest
of lower chest region
works well for most remember the
anterior adulthood has greater leverage
throughout shoulder flexion than the
pectoralis major
so for pectoralis major development we
would not be aiming to maximize the
degree of shoulder flexion
when initiating the ascent phase of the
barbell bench press
aiming to flare your elbows out is
likely advantageous
this will likely allow the pectoralis
major to produce more force
through a more efficient pull on the
upper arm also
the triceps produce the lateral force in
the barbell bench press
flaring your elbows allows greater
lateral force and therefore a stronger
triceps contraction
for most flaring your elbows will
naturally cause internal rotation
so the main functions of the pectoras
major indeed seem to occur to some
capacity in the barbell bench press
indicating the bench press may be an
excellent movement for developing this
muscle
let us now evaluate research assessing
just how well the barbell benefits does
at growing the pectoralis major starting
things off
a study by akagi and colleagues 18 men
with at least one year of training
experience
had their smith machine bench press one
rep max measured as well as the
cross-sectional area of their pectoralis
major
at multiple regions the largest
cross-sectional area value obtained for
an individual
was used for analysis a significant
correlation was found between smith
machine bench press warner at max
and pectoralis major cross-sectional
area now this study used a smith machine
but generally the stronger you are on
the barbell bench press
the stronger you would probably be on
the smith machine bench press
therefore this study implies the
stronger you get on the barbell bench
press
the greater hypertrophy the pectoralis
major would experience
however this was only a correlation
study
it fails to tell us if training the
bench press as your only chest
exercise would be sufficient to linearly
increase pectoralis major size
also this study does not inform us of
how well the bench press develops
different
regions of the pectoralis major
fortunately
we have research that can help us here
brandow and colleagues
had a group of untrained men trained the
barbell bench press for three to five
sets to failure
which is the point at which no more
repetitions can be performed
with an eighty percent water and maximum
load and three minutes of rest between
sets twice per week for ten weeks a two
time shoulder width grip was used
the cross-sectional area of the
pectoralis major measured at the t3 t4
thoracic region
increased by 9.1 percent on average and
9.1 percent
increase in cross-sectional area after
10 weeks of training
corresponds to an average of 0.13
increase per day
is this a lot or hardly anything a
review study by worm bomb and colleagues
can help us here
through assessing numerous studies they
measured the average increase in
cross-sectional area per day
for the quadriceps and elbow flexor
muscles after a period of training
based on these numerous studies the
quadriceps
on average experienced a 0.11 percent
increase in cross-sectional area per day
when trained with roughly six sets per
session three times per week
the elbow flexors on average experience
a 0.2
increase in cross-sectional area per day
when trained with roughly five sets per
session
three times per week also these numbers
are average from studies that mainly
involved untrained subjects so the
barbell bench press in the brandow and
colleague study
did not do a terrible job the 0.13
increase in pectoralis major
cross-sectional area per day
was above the 0.11 percent increase for
the quadriceps
but below the 0.2 increase for the elbow
flexors
interestingly one bomb and colleague
suggested the reason that elbow flexors
experience a greater rate of hypertrophy
versus the quadriceps
was because the quadriceps are generally
involved more in day-to-day tasks
meaning they are somewhat trained
thereby slightly limiting its capacity
to grow further
the pectoralis major is probably more
similar to the elbow flexors
in that they aren't as heavily used day
to day compared to the quadriceps
considering this one could argue that
brandow and colleague's results were
sub-optimal
given the 0.13 increase in pectoralis
major cross-sectional area
was it less than the 0.2 increase in
elbow flexor cross-sectional area
but it's important to note that 0.2
increase in elbow flexor cross-sectional
area per day
was from studies that averaged five sets
per session
three times per week the brandau and
colleague study
averaged only four sets on the bench
press twice per week
these differences somewhat limit our
ability to compare the numbers fairly
nonetheless let's move on to other
research yasuda and colleagues
had a group of untrained men performing
the barbell bench press for three sets
of ten reps
with a seventy five percent one rep max
load and three minutes of rest between
sets
three times per week for six weeks grip
width was not specified
bench press warner at max was retested
on the third week
enabling the readjustment of training
load cross-sectional area at the belly
of the pectoralis major
had increased by 17.6 on average
corresponding to a 0.42 increase in
cross-sectional area per day
slightly more than double the 0.2 elbow
flexor increase
therefore this study suggests the
barbell bench press
is an excellent exercise for the
pectoralis major
ogre saguaro and colleagues has seven
untrained men
training the barbell bench press for
three sets of 10 reps with a 75 percent
warner max
load and 2 to 3 minutes of rest between
sets
three times per week for 24 weeks a two
time shoulder width grip was used
bench press warner at max was measured
every three weeks
allowing the readjustment of training
load thickness of the pectoralis major
was measured at the third and fourth
costal cartilages
every week throughout the 24 weeks
increases in thickness
and bench press warner at max steadily
increased throughout the 24 weeks
we can see that as one red max increased
on the bench press
so did pectoralis major thickness by the
24th week
the subjects had experienced an average
43 increase in pectoralis major
thickness
corresponding to a 0.26 increase in
thickness per day
like the yasuda and colleague study this
is above the average elbow flexor
increase
however thickness and cross-sectional
area are not the same measurements so
this comparison might not be sensible
here
even so most would probably agree this
study implies the bench press is quite
effective for pectoralis major growth
so brandau and colleagues suggest the
bench press is fairly decent at growing
the pectoralis major
while yesuda and colleagues and ogre
sawara and colleagues
indicate that bench press may be
excellent at growing the pectoralis
major
these three studies assessed pectoralis
major growth in only one region
which was more or less the sternal head
what about other regions of the
pectoralis major
davis and colleagues had a group of
trained men and women with an average of
five years training experience
performing the barbell bench press for
four sets of five reps
with an 85 percent one-rep max load and
five minutes of rest between sets
twice per week for eight weeks grip
width was not specified
bench press warner max was retested
every two weeks
enabling the re-adjustment of training
load thickness of the pectoralis major
was measured in three regions
between the spaces of ribs 2 and 3 so
the upper region
between the spaces of ribs 3 and 4 the
middle region
and between the spaces of ribs 4 and 5
the lower region
the upper region can be considered the
clavicular head the middle region the
sternal head
and the lower region the coastal head on
average
the upper region experienced a 7.44
increase in thickness
corresponding to 0.13 per day the
middle region experienced a 10.06
percent increase in thickness
corresponding to 0.18 per day the lower
region
experienced a 7.45 increase in thickness
corresponding to 0.13 per day all
these values are below the zero point
two percent elbow flexor increase
however this measurement was muscle
thickness so again
this comparison may not be sensible but
probably more importantly
the subjects in the davis and colic
study had an average of five years
training experience
the elbow flexor data was from studies
mainly involving untrained subjects
with this in mind the results of this
study seem pretty good
comparing increases between regions of
the pectoris major there were not really
any extreme differences
average increases were more or less
similar between the upper
and lower region though they were both
less in comparison to the middle region
another study by ogre sawara and
colleagues had a group of untrained men
perform the barbell bench press
for three sets of ten reps with a 75 one
rep max load
and two to three minutes or rest between
sets three times per week
for 24 weeks a two time shoulder width
grip was used
bench press warner at max was retested
every three weeks
enabling the readjustment of training
loads cross-sectional area of the
pectoralis major
was measured at 25 percent the upper
region
50 percent the middle region and 75
the lower region of the pectoralis major
length
on average the upper region experienced
a 36.3
increase in cross-sectional area
corresponding to a 0.22 percent increase
per day
the middle region experienced a 37.3
increase in cross-sectional area
also corresponding to roughly a 0.22
increase per day
the lower region experienced a 40
increase in cross-sectional area
corresponding to a 0.24 increase per day
the subjects of this study were
untrained the measurement
used was also cross-sectional area
allowing a more fairer comparison with
the elbow flexor increase
provided by the wernborn and colic study
for all three regions
increases per day were slightly greater
than the 0.2
elbow flexor increase moreover increases
across the three regions were more or
less the same
suggesting the bench press targets these
areas now equally
from the research evaluating measures of
pectoralis major growth at one region
the sternal region for all papers
randall and colleagues suggest the bench
press is fairly decent
while yasuda and colleagues and ogre
sawara and colleagues
indicate the bench press is excellent
davis and colleagues
and a different paper by ogre sawara and
colleagues further support the idea that
bench press may be excellent
at growing the sternal head regarding
the clavicular and coastal portions
davis and colleagues suggest that
although the clavicular and coastal
heads
may experience similar and respectable
growth
it is slightly less than sternal head
growth conversely
ogre sawara and colleagues suggest all
three regions experience
comparable rates of hypertrophy
differences between the studies
such as the subject's training
experience could explain these
discrepancies
so is the bench press enough for
pectoralis major hypertrophy
all in all the research does appear to
suggest the barbell benchmarks may be
close to ideal for developing the
sternal region
for the clavicular and coastal regions
though the research suggests
meaningful growth will occur in these
regions from bench pressing
whether this amount of growth is
comparable to the sternal region
is a little less clear ogre sawara and
colleagues suggest it could be
whereas davis and kulik suggest it might
not be there are some noteworthy
limitations of the current evidence
firstly all of the studies evaluated
here lasted 24 weeks or less
four of these were also conducted on
untrained individuals
in the longer term it's possible
training only the barbell bench press
for your pectoralis major
could result in trading plateaus
altering your training variables
which could include more exercise
variation could be effective for getting
past stagnations
in this way other pectoralis major
exercises could be useful secondly
no study had another group perform the
barbell bench press
in combination with other pectoralis
major exercises
for comparison in other words it remains
possible that if we had two groups
one performing only the barbell bench
press and another performing the barbell
bench press with other pectoralis major
exercises
with both groups performing the same
number of weekly sets for the pectoralis
major
to avoid confounding effects of volume
the group performing the barbell bench
press with other exercises
could experience greater overall
pectoralis major hypertrophy
without research on these two areas i
believe we cannot truly conclude if the
barbell bench press is enough for
pectoralis major hypertrophy from
theoretical
as well as some experimental evidence
there are some exercises that could
complement the barbell bench press
[Music]
one positive thing about the barbell
bench press not mentioned yet
is it stretches the pectoralis major
under load this is noteworthy
as when the pectoralis major is
stretched research
indicates its sarcomeres which are the
contractile units of a muscle
are stretched sufficiently to produce
passive tension
this applies to the clavicular sternal
and costal heads
passive tension from the sarcomeres in
combination with the high amounts of
force produced by the sarcomeres
termed active tension during the lower
portion of the bench press
means a great deal of overall mechanical
tension mechanical tension is currently
the best categorized driver of muscle
growth
in the research however there are
exercises that achieve a greater stretch
of the pectoralis major
than the bench press such as the seated
machine chest fly
dumbbell flies would also count here
however i think a seated chest fly gives
you more stability and control over the
motion
maybe making the exercise safer cable
chest fly variations would also work
well
exercises such as these could complement
the barbell bench press
by providing stretch mediated
hypertrophy the barbell bench press
would otherwise not have
now flies more so dumbbell flies
have a reputation for being injurious if
you have any shoulder issues
or develop any shoulder issues it's
probably safer to avoid this movement
[Music]
for the clavicular head although the
research suggests
meaningful growth will occur in this
region from bench pressing
whether this is comparable to the
sternal region is a little less clear
anecdotally
it's common to hear the upper chest
being a problem area for many people
in response to this the incline bench
press is often recommended
the inclined barbell bench press begins
with greater shoulder flexion
meaning compared to a flat barbell bench
press greater degrees of shoulder
flexion would occur throughout a full
range of motion inclined bench press
remember the clavicular head along with
the anterior deltoid
is heavily involved in shoulder flexion
interestingly though
electromyography research is conflicting
in this area
laver and colleagues found similar
activation of the clavicular head
between a 30 degree and 45 degree
incline barbell bench press
both of which displayed greater
activation than the 0 degree
and 15 degree decline barbell bench
press throughout the majority of the
concentric phase
similarly coratella and colleagues found
greater clavicular head activation
with a 45 degree incline barbell bench
press compared to a zero degree
and 15 degree decline bench press
rodriguez radio and colleagues
compared clavicular head activation
between a zero degree
15 degree 30 degree 45 degree
and 60 degree incline barbell bench
press activation was greatest with a 30
degree incline
while both 45 degree and 60 degree
inclines
produced slightly less activation than a
zero degree inclined bench press
however stefan and armstrong found no
difference in clavicular head activation
between a 30 degree incline barbell
bench press and a 15 degree decline
barbell bench press
likewise sato bakken and colleagues
found similar clavicular head activation
between the 25 degree incline zero
degree incline
and a 25 degree decline barbell bench
press
electromyography does have noteworthy
limitations and so we probably shouldn't
get too caught up in this data
there is one longitudinal study that may
help us here
chavez and colleagues split 47 untrained
men
into one of three groups a flat bench
press group
an inclined bench press group or a
combination of both
group all three groups trained once per
week
for eight weeks the flat bench press
group trained the flat smith machine
bench press
for four sets to failure with an eight
to twelve wet max load
each session the inclined bench press
group also did this
but with a 44 degree incline smith
machine bench press
the combination of both group trained
each of those two exercises
for two sets to failure with an 8 to 12
rep max load
each session increases in sternal and
costal thickness
were similar between all three groups
however
increases in clavicular head thickness
were greater for the incline bench press
group
therefore this study suggests that at
least four sets per session on the
incline smith machine bench press
produces the greatest increases in
clavicular thickness
remember two sets from the combination
of both group was not enough
now the smith machine was used mechanics
between the smith machine and barbell
bench press
are not identical nevertheless maybe
this study indicates a 44 degree incline
barbell bench press
may provide greater clavicular head
growth than a flat barbell bench press
ultimately if at some point during your
training career
you feel your upper chest is
underdeveloped you may wish to
experiment with the incline barbell
bench press at various angles
aside from the incline barbell bench
press there are other exercises that
could potentially be good for the
clavicular head
such as an incline dumbbell bench press
low cable chest fly
and a decline push up
[Music]
like the clavicular head though the
research suggests meaningful growth will
occur in the coastal head from bench
pressing whether this is comparable to
the sternal head
is a little less clear a decline barbell
bench press is often recommended for the
lower chest
however lever and colleagues and
coratella and colleagues
found similar custom head activation
between a flat barbell bench press
and a 15 degree decline barbell bench
press sata baking and colleagues
also found similar sterno costal head
activation between a 25 degree decline
barbell bench press
and a flat barbell bench press again
electromyography has limitations
so we should approach these results with
caution on top of this
we unfortunately do not have any
longitudinal research here
an exercise that theoretically may be
good for developing the coastal head
is a dumbbell or barbell pullover
recall the coastal head at high angles
of shoulder flexion
is involved in shoulder extension during
the eccentric phase of a pullover
the shoulders are flexed to a high angle
during the concentric phase
shoulder extension occurs this motion
may do a good job at recruiting the
costal head
the barbell pullover has been shown to
highly activate the pectoralis major in
three studies
however these three studies did assess
activation at the sternal
or clavicular head so he cannot
necessarily be certain of the costal
head
regardless i think most people should be
able to feel a large portion of the
pectoralis major
being trained during a pullover
through analyzing the functions of the
pectoralis major
the motions that occur during the
barbell bench press and the longitudinal
research the bench press does appear to
be an excellent exercise for pectoralis
major hypertrophy
meaningful growth of the clavicular
sternal
and coastal heads of the pectoralis
major will probably occur through
barbell bench pressing
but the limitations of the current
research limit our ability to truly
answer the video's primary question
no paper has assessed the impacts on
pectoralis major hypertrophy
after training the barbell bench press
for longer than 24 weeks
also no paper has compared barbell bench
press training only
to bench pressing in combination with
other pectoralis major exercises
at the very least pectoralis major
growth would likely not be harmed with
the inclusion of exercises such as the
ones mentioned
if anything they could very much enhance
overall pectoralis major growth
furthermore exercise variation in the
long term
would probably make training more
enjoyable for most people
