hey folks dr michael rotell here for
renaissance spiritualization rp plus rpu
lecture number five in fat
loss nutrition fat loss periodization
ooh very very fancy sounding
so what are we going to talk about today
first we're going to address the
question of why we can't just keep
losing weight losing weight losing
weight losing weight losing fat losing
fat losing fat why do we need some kind
of structure
maintenance and breaks and all this
other stuff why can't we just go we have
to answer that question in order to even
justify this discussion
after we answer that question we're
going to talk about why a need for
maintenance phases even arises
we're going to talk about the birth of a
phasic structure like
this phase that phase this phase that
phase basically
is an analogy we're going to talk about
well you can't work continuously with no
weekends ever
we're going to describe the weekend
maintenance phase and then we're going
to describe what a week looks like
work week weekend work week weekend
working weekend that's that phasic
structure that alternates
and then we're going to do a sample of
what that actually looks like to give
you guys a real good
real world view of what this should look
like because it's one thing to talk
about theoretically
it's another thing to see like oh okay
that's how much weight we should try and
we should be trying to lose
this is what's realistic this is what's
not realistic and put it into context
so question why not
just keep losing fat forever or until
you meet your goal
right so let's say you start out at 200
pounds
and you want to weigh 160 lean why not
just go go go until you can
right and people will say like oh you
don't need periodization for fat loss
just eat less and move more the question
is
not that does that work but for how long
does that work right
and here's the thing long-term continual
caloric restriction
results in a couple of things it results
in muscle loss
results in increasing levels of fatigue
specifically diet fatigue
it results in performance loss and it
results in an increasing chance of
rebound
which is really real not only rebound
but actually just falling off the plan
without even accomplishing your goals
so basically as you diet
longer and longer and longer you get
this build up of all these negative
factors
that not only increase your chances for
failure but they increase your chances
of the whole
process not working out into your favor
losing a bunch of muscle so on and so
forth
and they also increase your chances for
even if you succeed for just
radically just coming right back up and
gaining a bunch of fat back and so on
and so forth
this is a really really bad deal and
here's the thing
you don't lose fat so you can get lean
once probably
right you probably want to lose fat so
you can keep as much of it off as you
can
right and even if you're a bodybuilder
and you actually just lose fat
periodically and gain it back
you ideally don't want to gain back like
you know 15
you might want to gain back 5 or
something like that so even for people
who just dip into low body fats every
now and again
the degree of rebound and the success of
the process remember muscle loss for
bodybuilders was totally off limits
has some validity you can't go forever
because you're not just trying to get to
a goal
you're trying to get to a goal survive
regain stability and prosper
to use a really harsh almost not analogy
example you know the region original
story of the
greek victory at marathon the battle of
marathon
supposedly you know some messenger ran
26.2 miles
declared to the leadership that the
battle had been won and promptly died of
exhaustion right there on the steps
gee you know that's not the greatest
thing for dieting
so if you really just want to go and
lose all the way down to your goal and
sort of die at the end you won't die but
you'll rebound like crazy and end up
back in the same spot
that's not exactly ideal so if someone
was saying to pick a pace to run
for the marathon you sure as hell
wouldn't pick that guy's pace if you're
in his shape you want to pick something
a little bit more conservative take a
break so on and so forth
right so if your plan is to be lean for
a day and then just rock it back
up um then you know
you're good to go you can just diet
forever until you get to your goal
but if your plan is anything other than
that then you probably want to do
something at least
occasionally to reduce diet fatigue let
it fall back down
so you can have another productive run
at a diet right
and a one-shot approach
seems reasonable if you're talking about
reasonable amounts of weight for example
and if you weigh 200 pounds and your
goal is to just weigh 180 permanently
and be leaner
is it a good idea for you to drop all
the way down to 180 in one dime yeah
maybe maybe not
right depending on specifics your coach
could say well yeah i think we should
drop 185
first and then take some break and then
drop to 175 and then let you rebound to
180 fine
because you know there's going to be a
little rebound for any diet and that
means you know go 200 to 175
that's pretty tough diet so maybe that's
a little bit of a stretch but it's a
little bit of a stretch and you can kind
of
really really hold my shit together then
maybe i'll be okay
and maybe i won't have to worry uh so
much if i just i'm really careful on the
rebound
i can do it fine but if we're talking
about
15 or more that you have to lose
we're talking about one-shot diets that
just have a
really low chance of success you know if
you weigh 200 pounds and you have to get
to 160
that's tough you weigh 200 pounds and
you have to get to
130 right as your long-term goal
one shotting that i've never seen anyone
do and well successfully i've seen
people get there and rebound
all the way back up real real big
problem
right so
because we can't diet forever and we
need these
breaks at some point to drop diet
fatigue we develop this need
theoretically for what we could call a
maintenance phase and what are
maintenance phases well
they're months multiple months long
phases of weight stability
after fat loss phases why are they
needed
well because all hypocaloric periods and
fat loss diets are fatiguing and they're
exponentially fatigued and that is the
longer the fat loss diet goes
the more exponentially the fatigue rises
from it
diet fatigue and the chances for rebound
hunger all that other stuff
but at some point you got to shut it
down and let all that fatigue come back
down
right it's like trying to work super
hard on something for four weeks
straight with
zero weekends and barely any sleep
you're just going to collapse at some
point or your productivity is just going
to go straight to hell
even if you somehow manage to uh
pitter-patter along
muscle loss will result eventually it
will result in good health it will
result in a terrible look
all really bad things and
psychologically dieting is really
difficult even if there was no
physical reason you have to take a
maintenance phase the act of restricting
yourself is not a sustainable act
at some point you have to just go
and relax and eat some normal food
in tune yourself to just living normally
and then you're ready for another hard
you know couple months of dieting to
accomplish your goals
right and even if you make it through
all of these and you successfully end
the diet that's way too long
if you survive the fat loss phase your
chance of rebound is massive
uh if you one shot a lot of weight loss
so maintenance phases take care of all
of this stuff
by reducing your diet fatigue back to
normal
and they do this over a very long term
so basically you just set your calories
to maintenance right so let's say you
down to 150 pounds from 170
you eat as many calories per week as
keeps you between
150 and 155. so the first week you might
bloat up a little bit carbs and salt
you weigh 156. and you're like okay
we'll see what next week is next week
it's 1 53. so you're good
next week it's actually 149 because
you're bloat went away and you're like
oh 149
my metabolism is speeding up again so i
need to up the calories and you start up
in the calories a little bit
and then it's 150 149 you have the
calories a little bit 15 49 you have the
calories a bit
and all of a sudden you're eating like a
lot of calories
eight weeks later you don't feel super
hungry you're not super cravy
psychologically you feel like you're
ready for another diet and then maybe
it's time to start another diet
versus keep going and just burn yourself
to the ground
right how often do we need these uh
maintenance phases
roughly every five to ten percent weight
loss so that's a good figure
because it obviates the duration and the
rate it doesn't matter it's just the
total that results
so you know if you weigh 200 pounds uh 5
to 10
weight loss is some weight between all
roughly 190 and 180 pounds
so you can make it to 185 you can make
it to 180 but i wouldn't go lower than
180 if you started 200 without taking a
maintenance phase
for at least some time how much time
well after you get to whatever goal
anywhere between five percent
maintenance phase can last anywhere from
about two-thirds
to one and a half times the length of
the actual preceding fat loss phase
that's a big deal people talk about
refeed weeks which accomplish
largely a whole lot of nothing reefy
days
almost certainly accomplish nothing in
terms of long-term fat loss
those are some conditions bodybuilders
may use for some exotic things they do
not apply to almost anyone else
diet fatigue takes a long time to rise
weeks months it takes just as long to
fall
sometimes even longer how do you know if
it's between two thirds and one and a
half well
if you only diet for a very short time
and you're not very aggressive with your
loss the loss rate
you might be able to do two thirds so if
you diet for six weeks and you only lose
half percent per week
a maintenance phase might only need to
last four weeks after that totally
reasonable
if you diet for three and a half months
and you lose one percent
per week that entire time holy crap
that's like 14
weight loss then one and a half times
the length of that
is something that is a real good thing
to think about so that's like let's have
five months of maintenance or something
sounds crazy but remember um
we're here at rp we're concerned with
getting results as fast as possible
sustainable results as fast as possible
unless we really believed it and we
thought we had the research to back it
up we would never say you should
rest for or maintain for one and a half
times the length of the diet if we
didn't think it was necessary
i myself have been burned with this
before if you have to ask
we're going to mention this later air on
the side of a longer maintenance because
you
basically just want to clean the slate
for sure
before your next fat loss diet the
purpose of the maintenance phase is to
just tell yourself i did a maintenance
phase now i would just get back to
dieting
the purpose of the maintenance phase is
to bring down all forms of diet fatigue
so that you're basically back almost to
square one
where you feel like you've always
weighed this weight
you the week after a diet are gonna feel
like
i just did a diet someone's gonna be
like brownies and you're like yes
right but if eight weeks later someone's
like brownies and you're like
then you're sort of just yourself again
right that's the goal the maintenance
phase and we're gonna take as
long as we need so while some people can
do two thirds and some people need one
and a half what you need is going to be
when you can honestly tell yourself that
your hunger is back to normal
your diet fatigue is back to normal your
energy levels are back to normal
everything feels fine you're
psychologically really truly in your
heart of hearts
ready for another fat loss diet you can
lie to yourself and that's fine nobody
cares
you're just gonna have a bad time by
yourself right so the purpose of the
maintenance phase
is to do that bringing down which means
you have to be honest and it's gonna
take a long time
two-thirds to one 1.5 the average there
is something like the
length of the diet and the length of the
maintenance days after are roughly the
same
i wish it was something different it
makes a lot of sense though right right
you generated this much diet fatigue it
took you three months it's probably
gonna take you about three months to
take it off
so being that we need maintenance phases
and of course we need fat loss phases
still to actually do the job
uh we can start to see the birth of a
phasic structure here right so
the long-term approach to losing lots of
fat uh might need some combination of
fat loss faces and maintenance phases
right
do we always need the maintenance phases
to be like about the same length as fat
loss faces no
right do most people at least benefit
from starting with longer maintenance
phases and
seeing how they feel and you know let's
say you do a three month maintenance
phase after a three month diet
and after two months you can honestly
tell yourself you're totally cool
finish the three months and then next
time be like okay maybe two months
and try the two months and if it two
months next time you do maintenance
phase you're like oh no i can still use
a little bit of a break
take the break but if for two months you
feel golden just like you did last time
then two months is cool so airing on the
side of more is better because here's
the deal
if you err on the side of more you just
quote unquote lose
to your normal life anyway it's not
losing
a month of potential fat loss dieting so
you're just living normal life
if you shortcut it and you air on the
side of two less
or too little you end up having a high
chance of rebound
and pissing away almost the entire fat
loss phase
that's a two-part problem part one is
that you pissed away a fat loss phase
part two is that you suffered through a
fat loss phase
right like if someone said to you uh hey
sit in this comfy chair and uh hear some
coffee and here's some magazines to read
wait for 30 minutes and if a girl with a
red balloon walks by
you win 500 bucks and if she doesn't
after 20 minutes you can just go home
yeah you read your magazines or you play
on your phone when you even do work you
have your coffee it's super comfortable
the girl never walks by you never get
500 bucks what did you lose
you lost 20 minutes or 15 minutes or
whatever
you know whatever it's like that's like
being a maintenance phase like
you're living life like it's fine the
coffee is delicious the magazines are
great
everything's great that's not the
analogy of the fat loss phase
going south on youth that's the
maintenance phase that's what it's like
to spend an extra month in maintenance
like yeah okay i didn't win the 500
right and there's nothing to benefit
from this maintenance phase it was too
long but now i go home and
or go to my job and make 500 the honest
way instead of spotting
girls with red balloons or the hell
crazy shit i compliment
the analogy for instead shortcutting
your maintenance be like oh i'm ready
even though you know you're not
in starting a fat loss too soon fat loss
face too soon burning out
rebounding right being back basically
the same way you were
uh is this somebody tells you hey um
it's like 40 degrees outside it's
fucking
raining go stand out there without an
umbrella
for 20 minutes and if the red girl comes
by you get 500 bucks
like uh okay i only have like a t-shirt
and shorts
like you're golden 500 bucks and you
look sweet
so you go out there fucking girl never
shows up no red no red
balloon no money what did you lose
it wasn't just the time it wasn't like
reading magazines and having
coffee it wasn't maintenance phase it
was fat loss phase a
fucking brutality of standing in a
fucking cold and rain like this
this fucking little girl better show up
i'm saying i'm taking that red balloon
off her
one way or another damn it i'm getting
my 500 and when she never shows
up and there's nobody around you're like
okay that's been 20 minutes i
hate this why it's not just that you
wasted the time it was it was very
difficult time
so if you're thinking oh i can
do this fat loss phase and i think i can
do it
i don't know can you if because if
you're not sure and if you burn out of
it
you just didn't waste that time you
wasted the time
and the brutality of the effort of the
fat loss phase because if you're gonna
piss away a month or two
you might as well be in maintenance when
you're having pizza and fun with your
friends
right it might as well not be in a
pissed away fat loss phase i hope that
makes sense
right so most people benefit from erring
on the side of more
rather than less the result will be
something like taking a fat loss phase
then going to maintenance phase
then a fat loss phase then a maintenance
phase and so on and so forth until you
reach
your sort of ultimate goal and can do a
maintenance phase to get the last bit of
the last diet fatigue off and then go to
a phase we call balance in the rp books
just living a healthy lifestyle training
eating loving life and not worrying
too much about your body weight totally
cool right is it tempting to just skip
this whole phasic structure
and just one shot the thing of course
it's tempting we're not going to sit
here and tell you like oh we're going to
do the basic approach and
just slow and easy and careful of course
we're all tempted to be like let's just
get this done now
that's not how it works if that worked
of course everyone would be doing it
everyone will be succeeding with it
the thing is most people are doing it
but almost none of them are succeeding
with it because it doesn't work
where does that leave us let's go to an
example really quick
so we have someone who wants
to hold around 160 pounds
and they're starting out at 200 pounds
now let me make this perfectly clear
that
is a very very big change
do you ever mistake people who weigh 160
for people who weigh 200 you'd have to
be blind for that
right here's another question
do you ever not notice when someone used
to weigh 200
but now weighs 160 oh my god it's out of
the question
so while it's only 40 pounds i don't
even know how as
a lot of people in society think 40
pounds is not that much and you know a
lot of the increase we get at rp people
are like i want to lose 50 pounds and
we're like what about 40 and they're
like that's
not enough that's not that's nothing
like 40 is not nothing
it's huge what a huge change this is
200 pound individual who's not very well
trained is visibly
fat a 160-pound individual who that same
person who's relatively well trained has
some maybe 10 pounds extra muscle
is in great shape that's crossfit shape
right there
so this journey from 200 pounds
to 160 pounds or so is gonna take us
roughly
what am i looking at here about
a year and a half almost two years some
of you watching this
might think what are you talking about
40 pounds is like something you lose in
a summer oh and you're completely
correct
if you plan on rebounding and just going
totally sideways and regaining all of it
back my wife and i watch a show called
my 600 pound life if you ever motivated
to lose weight or need motivation
watch multiple episodes of that show
you'll have no problem losing weight
it's individuals who are candidates for
bariatric surgery and they have to get
under 600 pounds to be approved for the
surgery because otherwise it's just too
difficult and too
uh taxing on them and too uh risky for
their health to even do a bariatric
surgery
or they remove most of your stomach and
staple you back up and then you're never
you know you're full after an apple and
you lose a bunch of weight
the percent success rate with
individuals that are that large
is like less than five percent it's tiny
and these are folks who can lose 40
pounds in like a month
right because that's how big they are
it's how small of a percent of their
weight that is
so when people say like oh it's just 40
pounds
people do it all the time those are
precisely the people that almost never
succeed
right be like oh that one 500 pound guy
lost 40 pounds like
and what's he up to now like oh i think
he weighs 550 now
but he lost it before no shit right so
rebounding
not a clever trick right
the problem of how to lose weight has
been largely solved
by society like you know if aliens are
coming and they need
10 people to lose 100 pounds each and
these people are 300 pounds
we got all the tools we can make them
lose weight if the aliens say now they
need to keep it off for 10 years
earth's and deep shit right if they got
the phaser gun pointed at earth and
they're like
these motherfuckers are fatter after 10
years
boom north pole right uh we're really in
trouble
so a lot of this is going to look what
i'm going to talk about this example
we're going to talk about these really
small chunks of weight loss at a time
and these long maintenance phases you'll
be like why are we going so slow
because keeping the weight off means
these gradual shifts and settling points
that never freak your body out to be
like oh my god i'm starving oh my god
shovel back food in it's all about
taking that measured approach
not too slow but definitely not too fast
definitely not one shot
because this person at the end of this
journey 160 pounds or so
is going to feel like they've always
weighed 160. they're going to have the
health habits the lifestyle habits the
food habits the training habits
to support it and they're going to weigh
160 for as long as they want to
versus someone crash dieting from you
know june
all the way through october losing 40
pounds taking a bunch of selfies
pictures
las vegas all you can eat buffets
lose motivation fall off track come back
at 205
rejoin your crossfit gym next june and
be like well i gotta lose this weight
again people do that all the time
this is crazy i'm sorry for ranting all
the fucking time people do this they're
gonna have this they do redo the
same fucking challenge over and over
again
every year every new year's the same 20
pounds comes off except they aren't five
pounds up five pounds up five pounds on
the same 20 they lose
because they're not doing this in a
large part let's take a look at this
example
first we start in june so remember that
we start in june
june to august three-month diet we go
from 200 pounds to 180 pounds
pause at 180. after losing 20 pounds on
your first diet
you could just smell 160 you can taste
it you can
feel it right it's like going halfway up
mount everest or seventy percent of the
way there and you can see the summit
you're like
oh let's just go and you're like nope
there's just dead people up there
you gotta get to base camp you gotta
rest so 180
and then during then this is kind of
like i don't want to say a worst case
scenario but this
scenario puts in a lot of padding from
september all the way through december
nice long maintenance phase through the
holidays and everything
great time for maintenance by the way
you go from 180 pounds to 185 pounds
yeah you gained a little bit of holiday
weight a little five pounds no big deal
right some of them might have been water
some was fat no big deal you're still
down 15 pounds
next we go from january to march you
know nothing happens january or march
anyway perfect time for diving by the
way
mostly because it's winter and it sucks
unless you're on the south side of the
world
than january through march's sweet so
just died during the uh uh
the summer january through march we
start at 185
and we get to 170. now again 170
let's just push it let's just keep
pushing it let's get to 160
don't do it don't do it because it's a
real bad deal and you're gonna have
a huge chance of rebounding stop at 170.
now this is when the psychologically
tough stuff happens
march we stopped at 170 april to july
we go from 170 to 175. it's been a fun
summer
right and we're not saying need to gain
five pounds but a lot of times you will
just from just living normally having
fun and doing a maintenance phase it's
okay plus or minus five pounds no big
deal
august to october you restart the diet
okay and you go
from 175 pounds to 165 notice that's
just 10 pound drop
because now you're getting leaner your
body's starting to hold onto fat more
it's taken
more oomph to get the same amount of fat
off so we got to just
set smaller chunk goals and because
you're lighter the percent
of weight loss is similar to what it was
when you were heavier and
more weight 165 again
this has become really tempting in
october
you finish basically november first
rolls around you weigh 165 are like good
i could just
finish this another five pounds i can
crash diet all the way into thanksgiving
late november and i'm done but are you
really
because you get to 160 at the end of
thanksgiving what happens by the time
the holidays are over you didn't just
get to thanksgiving
you got to 160 pounds when you shouldn't
have you should have stopped at 165.
if you would have started your
maintenance phase right on november 1st
at 165
you would have had way lower diet
fatigue
and not much to begin with because only
ten pounds and way lower because it's
three weeks or four weeks
three weeks until thanksgiving by the
time you're eating your thanksgiving
meal and getting ready for all the fun
christmas food you're like yeah you know
you're a normal person more or less like
yeah food's fun but it's not that fun
you're not like gonna be eating 10
turkeys in a row
but if you do that 160 instead of 165
and if you end at thanksgiving instead
of a couple weeks before
you are going to turn the holidays into
a giant festival
of stuffing your face and what's going
to happen
you're going to be all the way back up
to 171.75 you're going to have zonked
yourself back
to last april
why that would be so ridiculous so stop
at 165.
here's the deal you're gonna have fun
during the holidays november december
great great time
165 to 170 pounds you're back at 170.
that sucks sort of but you're back at
170 you have almost no diet fatigue to
speak of because you
took your damn time now
in january and march is our last stretch
we go from january january february
march 3 months
we go from 170 it's not that high to 160
finally
and then april and beyond we hold 160 to
165 we enjoy eating and training
boom and that last time that you get to
160
right or really the first time you get
to 160 you got there by losing just 10
pounds
and you got there after you had all of
november and december as a maintenance
phase through the holidays
the diet ends almost anticlimactically
it's like running past the finish line
in a marathon and looking behind you and
you're like
am i the first one over there like yeah
new world record and you're like
okay no one's pushing you there's no
yelling you're not even tired
wouldn't it be great if all marathons
were like that wouldn't it be great if
the only thing you had to say at the end
of a diet was like huh
that was not hard so they're like okay
now you just live your life and eat
healthy and have a couple cheats every
now and again and just just weigh what
you weigh
and you're like okay i can do this this
is the easiest thing in the world
versus you scratch and claw your way to
160 after
ignoring all the advice and just
plummeting down let's say you just only
took two
like one maintenance phase instead of
like four whatever we recommend
and you know someone's like
congratulations
you wait one second it's so great like
you're just gonna we went 60s from now
on and you're like uh-huh and they're
like is that going to be tough to keep
the weight off and you're like
yes fuck i just want to eat my own hand
can i eat my own hand can i function
without a right hand
i mean robots are cool i'll probably
have a robotic hand soon right
that kind of thing people think they're
only goal oriented
they're only oriented to the end of this
boom i gotta get here
this is bullshit this is where you want
to be
so if you get here and you've got
breathing room and you all you have all
your maintenance strategies in place
this is easy that's how you want to
arrive to the end
that's why periodization for fat loss is
super important folks
