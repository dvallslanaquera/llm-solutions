hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization hypertrophy concepts and
tools lecture
19 counting volumes i know
tons of you couldn't wait for this
lecture sorry it had to be 19th
just the sequence in which it occurs in
hypertrophy book as far as a relevant
topic
how do we count training volumes what is
this all about so first of all
why count volumes at all some good
reasons there
why we're going to count sets versus
other ways of counting volumes
we're going to talk about counting per
session versus per week
big difference so we have to be very
clear in how we count because you know
people say what's your mrv
10 sets was it 10 cents per session or
10 cents per week two potentially very
different numbers there
then we're going to talk about counting
compound exercises
with multiple muscles in them as to
which muscle to count you know
is bench pressing counted towards tricep
hypertrophy or towards pec hypertrophy
who knows we have three different
methods all with their pluses and
minuses
to analyze which one uh to use we're
gonna
talk about counting uh different
training methods like for example
drop sets versus maya reps versus
supersets versus straight sets
interesting uh do we count all those as
regular sets maybe maybe not
and then lastly we're going to talk
about counting consistency which is
incredibly important
and counting simplicity which might have
some really really big benefits so
let's get into it why do we cut volume
super short discussion here
for best results it's obvious to you
folks by now you have to know you're
rough
maintenance volume minimum effective
volume maximum recovery volume at the
very least
if you just don't know how much volume
you're doing you're off to a real bad
start it's like not knowing how much
weight you're using at the gym
you wouldn't make that mistake that's
kind of ridiculous for progression week
to week
volume is an important factor right if
you just do some training on
this monday and the next monday you're
like oh i need to do a little more how
do you know how much you did this monday
if you're not counting at least the
number of sets you're doing possibly
reps and so on and so forth
and you know if you are counting
your volume in no way at all then
you actually won't even be able to know
if you're hitting your volume landmarks
or if they're in line and someone can
say you know are you sure you're
training enough on this fat loss phase
to conserve muscle and you're like well
yeah and like how do you know that well
i'm doing enough volume and you're like
okay
how much volume are you doing and how
much do you usually need to maintain a
huge blank look on your face not a good
thing right
you won't be able to ensure progression
over weeks because progression involves
sometimes raising volume and you have to
sort of
meticulously raise it to a certain
extent so for example
you know if last week something like i
think four i don't know i wasn't
tracking sets of leg press i think
i did and i got not sore enough in my
quads at all and i felt really like
refreshed and i know it's not enough
you know how many sets am i going to do
you know this week well if you don't
have a notebook to look at that says
four sets last week
you might do like eight sets this week
because you're like more and
instead of doing five or six you do
eight and your quads get super duper
sorry way too much damage
you don't grow hardly at all and you
pissed away another week of training
that's really dumb right so
volume matters and counting it matters
quite a bit which is why we're here
having this
lecture next point
why sets count the number of hard sets
you're doing count versus two
other methods first method is what uh we
have termed mathematical volume
it's just sets times reps times weight
and hypothetically times distance as
well it's the amount of mechanical work
you're doing
it is absolutely the most accurate way
to count volume
that's its upside because it ge whiz it
tells you all the information you'll
ever need to know
however it's the least predictive of
stimulus or fatigue
here's a really really good example if
you do
a set of five close to failure
your mathematical volume is very low if
you do a set of
30 close to failure your mathematical
volume is
fucking enormous it's like five times
bigger
or at least four times bigger right
because yeah it's less weight but not by
that much
it's way more reps than it is less
weight if you just multiply sets reps
weight
then you just set as one reps in weight
distance is the same same exercise
you know it really makes it seem like
higher up sets are
way more volume and they are but that's
not predictive of stimulus
because sets of five and sensor 30 have
roughly the same hypertrophic stimulus
and it's not predictive of fatigue
because sometimes they have similar
fatigue and sometimes they don't
depending on the exercise depending on
the movement depending on the person so
on and so forth
so mathematical volume is really cool if
you're a super perfectionist who wants
to collect data that goes nowhere
but it really doesn't tell us a whole
lot about what's going on unfortunately
it would be great if we could use it
but it's just not super useful in
hypertrophy training
what about effective wraps counting
effective reps counting the definition
here is you count
only the reps in the set that are north
of five reps in reserve
so if you have a set that ends at two ir
uh and then you know it's a set of ten
then that means you have three effective
reps because it's you know five four
three and then you stopped uh and then
that's it okay so
that's three effective reps and then
let's say you do six or seven more sets
just like that
and you know it's six times three or
roughly 18 to 20
effective reps that you did through that
whole workout so only counting effective
reps this is
under the presumption that effective
reps are the only ones that matter for
two things
stimulus which is a decent argument not
the best
and fatigue which is total bullshit
because all reps matter for fatigue
you know if you had to do a bunch of
ineffective reps
versus a program that only effective
reps certainly the ineffective reps
program in addition to that would be
more fatigue but automatically we know
that this is
not going somewhere really good um the
upside here is that it's more applicable
than mathematical volume right
at least the effect of reps counting
would say that 30 ram and a 5rm
last previously mentioned which in
mathematical volume predicts nothing
at least it'll give you a pretty good
stimulus to fatigue ratio
estimate between the two right very very
comparable
however it's uh not accurate
because the reps that lead into the
effect of reps are also
uh both stimulative and fatiguing and we
miss those entirely
and you get really really weird uh
conclusions for example
if you have a set of zero reps in
reserve that's five effective wraps
and if you do two sets that stop two or
three reps in reserve that's also five
effective reps
if you count stimulus and fatigue in
that way you're essentially saying that
a set at zero rir has just as much
fatigue as two sets of two or three rer
which is actually probably true
hilariously what about stimulus well
there's about 10 studies now that show
that
if you stop people at roughly two to
three reps in reserve
that per set they get essentially almost
the same or the same and sometimes even
higher hypertrophy than a set truly to
failure
but you predicted that it was going to
take two sets of two or three are to get
the same as
one set of zero rf hypertrophy and
that's just wrong by a
factor of two right so all of a sudden
the stimulus calculations are way way
way off
and if you count only with effective
reps you're automatically biasing
yourself to go way too close to failure
all the time
which is not effective uh maximally and
just not necessary and it wildly throws
off your calculations right
lastly the best way to count volume is
by the number of working sets
uh this was established by a few
researchers a few years ago popularized
by by the great greg knuckles
and it really is an awesome way to count
you just count the number of sets that
are working sets that are essentially 5r
or less and you treat them roughly as
equivalent
right so if you did five sets that's you
know count five sets uh as your volume
you did six sets six that's
your volume it's okay if some of those
were slightly different rars or slightly
different exercises it's
working sets or working sets and they
for the muscle they target roughly
similar amounts of hypertrophy
definitely the most applicable and most
accurately proxy stimulus and fatigue
which is why we're going to use it
the downsides here really wouldn't call
it downsides because the other
methods don't even address this is
a complexity is how do we address
supersets
drop sets etc are they just regular sets
right so like how many cents at least
say you do skull pressures to close your
bench superset
is that two sets for triceps or one set
not sure but we'll figure that out later
so let's take a look at how this evolves
before we take a look at in depth
counting sets first various modalities
we've got to get this out of the way
counting has to be very specific
to per session or per week okay when you
count sets it's important to be specific
about the frequency for example
you can say my mrv is 20 cents for chest
but that doesn't mean a whole lot
because someone can ask okay is that
over two sessions or four sessions
because it seems to be
that to a point adding frequency
increases your mrv
right so if you train chest and this has
been very well demonstrated in at least
two studies from brazil now
where you have training just once a week
mrv uh certainly mav maximum adaptive
volume seems to be somewhere between
five and ten cents per session
it's kind of ridiculous that's over the
course of 20 weeks without a deloads you
could say in shorter bursts you could do
more
but let's say 10 cents right 10 cents
per session is close to your you know
mrv very close to your mav
with one session of chest per week but
what about with two we have a bunch of
data that says with two it's something
like 15 to 20.
we have some very good data from various
other studies the most famous one is the
um
uh the schonfeld and krieger study in
the the studies from brazil that it
replicated uh
is that when you go to three sessions
you get even more mrv now this is
slightly less effective
per set training so there is some leeway
to that but definitely the volumes
change
you can't tell someone like hey mrv is
40 sets for chest
and like what that's crazy do 40 sets
everyone work out you're like no no it's
over five workouts and all of a sudden
like that just doesn't sound that crazy
that's like eight sets of workout it
seems reasonable
um you have to be specific so you don't
want to say my mrv is 20 sets for chest
necessarily you want to say when i do
two sessions a week
my chest on rv is 20 right um
and when you refer your volume landmarks
you probably want to do this
per session or per week and you always
want to have a frequency so saying my
mrv is 20 cents per week doesn't mean a
whole lot
but it means something but it could be
more you see you know my mrv
when i train chest three times a week is
25 sets i want to train it twice a week
it's 20 sets and once a week it's 15.
that makes a lot more sense so it's a
really good idea to have that session
and frequency pinned
down all right so we're going to count
sets
we're going to cut working sets we're
not going to do mathematical volume
we're not going to do effective rep
counting
how are we going to do it okay first of
all counting isolation exercises
is easy okay like in one set of tricep
extensions is one fucking set of tricep
extensions no problem
the complexities come in in counting
compounds
okay is a close grip bench
one set for chest
kind of except if you tuck your elbows a
lot your chest is less active than it
would be in a wide grip bench
so if you're saying okay i'm doing a
close grip this week uh on monday and
then this week on wednesday i'm doing
wide grip like
how many sets of chests do i count is
this one more than the other
because my chest gets more sore and more
pumped with the wide grip and less or
less pump with the close grip so if i
count them both as one
that's sort of something is being lost
in translation right on the other hand
somebody could ask what about triceps
right uh one set of close grip bench is
that
one set for triceps like sort of again
change your tricep pretty well
but skull crushers hit your triceps more
directly so they're for sure
one and can we say you know someone can
say like man you know
i i need 10 sets of triceps to get
remotely sore and you're like fuck
you need 10 sets of skull crushers to
get sore like no no i just do wide grip
dips
and incline dumbbell press but it uses
my triceps you're like man that's not
really tricep training though like it
sort of is
there's a lot lost in there what about
front doubts is front delt training
a third do we count one third with the
close grip bench
right front delts and dips i mean
they're involved sort of but not a ton
like again
front delts and overhead process sure
fine one to one
what about you know when they help
exercises where they're not a ton
involved here's a really good one in
chest
flies what do we count front delt
volumes because then chest flies if you
ever feel your front delts
they're active at least to some extent
but
it's not maximum so if we say like trust
flies one
for chest one for biceps because they're
flexing the whole time one for four arms
because i'm holding the weight and one
for front delts
you know you're gonna have a program
where you supposedly do 40 sets for
front delts but your adults aren't
growing and they're never sore and
they're never tired and they're never
getting beat up
and you're like well 40 such that's
crazy well those are real sets right so
we're into some shit we're definitely
into a problem
we have a few options as to how to get
out of it how to have some consistency
method number one is a this average
method of complexity the next method
we're going to look at is very complex
and the one after that is very simple
average complexity method method one
count all target muscles
as one set so for example in the bench
press your pecs count as getting one set
per set of bench easy
and then you count all main synergists
as
half set main synergist for your pecs
includes your front delts okay they
definitely contribute a lot for the wide
work bench
uh or just regular grip bench so we
count them as a half a set
right so if you do four sets of a
regular grip bench
we count that as two sets for front
delts if you're going to do set counting
very precisely that's how you count them
and then for triceps they're also a
major contributor right you if you pull
your tricep off the bone if you have a
tricep injury you're not doing any kind
of benching right you're clearly that's
going to be a thing
so you know whereas if you pull your
calf you can do all the benching you
want because it doesn't interfere at all
right it's not involved
so it's involved significantly we call
it a major synergist or a main synergist
and then you know we count it as half so
if you do again four sets of regular
bench
that's four sets for pecks two sets for
front dots like we mentioned and two
steps for triceps so it makes some sense
it makes some sense
and then what about minor synergists and
stabilizers
right like so for example if you're
doing
uh you know high bar squatting would we
count like the lower back
well man does your lower back everybody
gets sore from high bar squat like no it
does from deadlifting but not from
squatting
but can we say that it's just not active
at all like no it's a thing
if you do like 50 sets of squats
throughout the week your back will
fucking pay the price you will have to
reduce your down the volume roll volume
so on and so forth
so but that's a minor synergist slash
stabilizer
in this average method we're just not
going to count it does that miss some
details
yes so maybe we want a more advanced
count let's get on to method number two
method two counts all involved muscles
somehow here we go folks
again not advocating this just showing
you the lay of land
count all the involved muscles prime
movers are one set
uh per set easy straightforward count
when we do in bench
you know we count let's do another
exercise just for for shits and giggles
when we're doing overhead tricep
extension
one-to-one triceps for sure okay great
major synergists are at two-thirds of a
percent so you know overhead extensions
this last lockout part definitely uses
your front delts significantly
so we're gonna say that's two-thirds so
if you do three sets of overhead tricep
extensions
we count that as two sets of main front
delt work okay
makes some sense synergists
at half a set percent right so a minor
synergist in this case
might be your lats especially if you're
doing them back this way right
because it takes your lats to pull your
arm back or let's say we're doing a
skull crusher but we're doing it back
here
okay definitely triceps but you actually
do have to use your lats quite a bit
to return the bar i mean are they
getting the work out of their life no
so we only give them half a set percent
so four of these kinds of skull crushers
and you get two sets to your lats it's
not unreasonable right
and then stabilizers unless they have a
really big
raw stimulus magnitude or fatigue
exposure like for example technically
the spinal erectors are a stabilizer for
the deadlift in the sense that they
don't move but they produce force
uh you know they're as far as we're
gonna count them they're one to one for
the deadlift right
so unless they're doing a ton of work
the stabilizers are gonna count
as one-third percent example your
forearms
or your forearm musculature in your uh
overhead you know behind the neck laying
down tricep thing
uh yeah it's gonna count for a third of
a set so if you do
you know three sets of these triceps it
counts as one set of forms which funny
enough
some of you may be putting this together
right now how come so few people
train their forearms directly well
because this has some merit
where would forearms and your muscles
that grip
where would they rank on rows curls
triceps bench every fucking exercise
gives them like well one-third of an
effect per set
so what's their mrv well probably it's
really really high
because they're very high endurance
muscles they're used to moving all the
time and they're relatively small they
don't take out a ton of damage so we can
hypothesize their mrv and relatively
well trained people
is something like 40 cents like 40 sets
but i've done zero sets of those last
week and my forums are fucking big and
they've been growing my entire training
career i've never done forums on their
own
well here's the thing if you count with
fractional counting like this to
reflect the most deep reality of what's
going on from a stimulus perspective and
a fatigue perspective
that's a lot of one-thirds adding up
every row every pull down
every curl every extension every
everything trains your grip one third
when you do like a hundred or 120 as you
go to your number you do 120 sets per
week for all your muscles
and all of your muscles you usually grip
on even squats
right then all of a sudden shazam you're
down to
40 you know one third of 120 40 sets
boom
there's your grip on rv right so it
makes some sense that this stuff
is as deep as it gets right this is the
most
very very precise way to count you can
do a
variation here but this is a very very
precise the most precise way we're going
to talk about
now here's the deal with these numbers
you know what's a prime mover what's a
major change what's a minor synergist
what's the stabilizer remember we talked
about spinal rectors technically from a
biomechanics perspective a stabilizer
but in the deadlift to take such a huge
force
and have to produce so much tension that
they count one-to-one
you have to use auto-regulation in your
counting so
if you noted okay in the in the close
grip bench
the pecs are going to be a major center
just account for two-thirds
but you do three sets of close grip
bench your triceps don't get sore but
your pecs get notably sore
looks like triceps count in two-thirds
and your pecs are counting as one
you say well i don't do close-grip bench
for my pecs
doesn't matter what you say the
physiological realities matter now maybe
you should close your grip a little more
but maybe it's not even possible
then for you based on your body design
and how you execute the movement and a
bunch of other differences maybe your
pecs are not as strong as your triceps
on and so forth for you
the close grip bench is more a chest
exercise than the tricep pictures how do
you know that
how much disruption is caused to the
target muscle how much of a pump
how much perception like you can even do
it during training
your close trip mentioned and every time
you close your bed
you just feel tons of tension in your
pecs and you're like okay
you rack the weight and someone's like
tricep day right and you're like yeah
tricep day
couldn't feel my triceps at all no pump
no tension perception
skull crusher's hell yeah but a triceps
man maybe two thirds maybe
half so if you're gonna take the time to
be this precise
make sure to auto regulate correctly to
rank body parts or muscle groups on how
they actually respond how much damage
they actually take
versus some hypothetical idea folks
here's why
you'll see this is going to be hilarious
inside joke between the people that
watch this video and myself and everyone
else on my instagram
uh people on instagram ask me all the
time how many sets
for you know for for lats does the bent
row count
because it's not the big stretch up here
like pull ups is it half or whatever
the real answer is only that person
knows that based on how they
demand rebates and i know muscle
architecture own muscle strengths and
weaknesses
all i say is listen how bad does it mess
up your lats how much of a pump do you
get so on and so forth
it's like man like that rose hit my lats
as hard as anything else bro it's one to
one
easy but it's like man i can barely feel
my lats and honestly i can do a
controlling bent rows and get like
barely sore on my lats
yeah you're looking at like a half or
maybe even a third who knows right so
you've got to use your own auto
regulation here your own wisdom
you can have predicted this next point
i'm gonna make this is incredibly
laborious
but potentially very precise however
it's not clear that this is
accurate remember precision if you have
a bullseye analogy
precision doesn't mean you throw the
darts in the middle of the bull's eye
it means wherever you throw them you're
throwing them at the exact same place
every time
so this set counting could get you a
very precise small group estimate of
exactly how much volume you're doing
but does it actually reflect on where
the bullseye is
does it act to actually reflect how
on average are you in the right way of
of estimating volumes maybe not accuracy
is the average of all your dart hits so
funny enough if you throw a dart up here
dart up there dark here dart there 100
darts later
we average all of your locations and
they're right in the bullseye you have
perfect accuracy
but your precision sucks but ideally
you'd have perfect accuracy and
precision you'd be bullshit every single
time
but if you're training and there's tons
of con founders for example
exercises change like you know exactly
that you did
57 sets of chests you know last
mesocycle
and you know exactly that this method
cycle you need 57 sets of chest
to stimulate the same way but hold on a
second you did a bunch of machine
presses last mass zone this time you're
doing barbell presses
so you say in 57 but the stimulus is
different different exercises stimulate
differently so you're incredibly
precise you know it's 57 but that number
doesn't mean as much as you think it
means
if you zoomed out a little bit and used
a method that's very accurate but not as
precise you could have literally the
same
accuracy the same success in your
program without having to count super
super in depth
right so that's definitely a downside
which takes us to
our last potential method which is
method three
and that's where you only count prime
movers slash the highest
raw stimulus and fatigued muscles and
you only count
one muscle per movement sometimes two
what's an example of this so
close grip bench you do it hits your
triceps pretty well
hits your pecs a little bit triceps one
easy on the isolations but on the
compounds here's another example
squats high bar do your glutes get hit
yeah
but they also get hit a little bit on
bent rows they get a little bit on
deadlifts they get hit a bunch of stuff
no more on those exercises or less than
they do in your squats
what really gets hit your quads
right so you count one for your quads
and zero for anything else people say
how much hamstring involvement do i
count in my
sumo deadlift my response to them is how
sore do your hamstrings get after 10
sets of sumo deadlifts like
not at all like well you're really going
to count it for anything
like you imagine your muscle just
doesn't feel any weakness or soreness or
pump or any kind of disruption no
no information for us to conclude that
you did anything with it
and you're counting it because
biomechanically it should be
contributing some small fraction
for the love of god maybe not a great
idea right
so if we're counting just one muscle
group
this could be too simple of a count for
example
if we count dips as only tricep
movements
we could get into a situation where like
man you know my chest mrv used to be 20
for two sessions but man this mezzo it's
like
15 bro and someone's like fuck that hot
why why is your chest so tired like i
don't know and they look through your
program you're like well you got all
these dips here you like
you did eight sets of dips for triceps
you're like yeah but that's not chest
that's triceps and someone's like
does your chest get sore from those
you're like yeah dude on the
lower outer side and it's super weak and
the next day i'm trying to bench
that's super heavy like you know your
chest works on dips right like well but
it's not the
main thing well no shit it's still
something right so
chest when tracking on dips if you use
just one
maybe not but then again we run into
another conundrum right if you
counting you say okay but you said one
to two
so i count my chest uh work i count one
for triceps for sure so for dips
one for triceps and fuck it one for
chest but like man
you could do a do doing a lot of like
dips and a lot of like close grip
push-ups and count one for chest and be
like man my chest mrv this
cycle is like you know for two sessions
it's like 30. it says well you have 30.
you're gonna have to do so many flies
next time you do eight sets of flies and
your packs fall off you're like ah
something's lost in translation
i guess the close group benches and the
dips don't really hit my pecs
a full one set to onset so you see where
the problem uh
is arising and you know a real good
example for this falls apart
is like stiff legged deadlifts what's
the muscle what's the one muscle you're
gonna count
uh hamstrings for sure right what's the
second muscle you're gonna count
um uh let's say glutes right because
they're very active
are you really gonna count back a zero
for stiff-legged deadlifts like spinal
erectors you fucking crazy they get sore
they say okay well what kind of spine
erectors are you really gonna cut glutes
zero and stifling and deadlifts like
you're gonna do a whole workout of
lunges and then the next day expect your
stuff like a deadlift to just be like oh
there's no glute involvement no big deal
fuck that's crazy right so definitely
something missing here
but this simplicity might have a huge
benefit to where
it might be something you use most of
the time right
one big upside and we'll see more about
this in a couple slides one big
upside advanced lifters especially
tend to have very specialized routines
where
uh they need the most precise counting
but they design their routines first of
all their programs
second of all their execution and also
the
way they modify exercises and actually
do the exercises
into a way that's very muscle specific
for example
if a regular person trying to get big
trains their chest they might use medium
grip bench press and the extra tricep
work is awesome for them
but a high level bodybuilder knows that
he has to save his triceps for two days
later when he trace tries so
specifically
so his chest work might be flies and
then wide grip bench and then wide grip
deficit push-ups which train triceps
almost not at all
train the chest like crazy a bodybuilder
might do leg extensions or leg presses
before squatting to pre-exhaust their
quads
so that glutes and all the other stuff
and lower back that we normally count a
little bit
are just not involved anymore also their
technique is better
they when a when a regular person does a
curl they might do some front belts with
it and some forearms and stuff
when a high level bodybuilders occur
they might do it even
choosing a different exercise they might
do a concentration curl leaned over and
really just isolate the shit out of
their biceps
so you would say when more advanced
lifters need this crazy precise count
method number two ah they might actually
be biased towards method number three
because everything to them starts
looking more like an isolation
or is turned more into an isolation
based on how they execute the exercise
and with various pre-exhaust tactics
so lastly
before we get to our summary slide and
sort of figure out which way to go
counting different training methods so
what are the training methods well there
are some and they're detailed and
you know depending on when you watch
this video in the uh soon to be released
or already released hypertrophy book
um straight sets
just set and then you rest a normal
amount then you just do a set rest
normal amount down sets which is the
same exercise but lighter sets
giant sets which is when you say i'm
going to do 60 total reps and i'm going
to do straight sets as many
times as it takes to get to 60 and
you're not worried about going super
close to failure each time
worried about my muscle connection a bit
more myo reps where you rest like five
to ten seconds between mini sets and you
keep going and going and going
drop sets which is a maya rep but you
reduce the load and you uh
go a little faster antagon is super sets
or sorry agonist supersets antagonists
for general fitness otherwise totally
different topic agonist supersets where
you do a tricep skull crusher and then
you close revenge right same muscle
superset
and then occlusion training right so we
have quite a bit of methods here
surely we count straight sets with a
one-to-one count
set as a set but what about all the
others well straight sets
one to one down sets one to one because
it's still the same
same same idea and maya reps and drop
sets so my reps and drop sets have very
few reps
in them after the first set but all of
them are so close to failure
that we can probably count them one to
one on both stimulus and fatigue for
sure
fatigue and if we do any kind of
counting we have to make sure we're
counting fatigue
and not just stimulus and fatigue is
probably more important to count
because it's easy to get a stimulus but
it's easier to do too much and get too
much fatigue so
probably comfortable counting those as
one to one so for example
if you do a maya website where you do
one sort of lead in first set
you do three sets after sets of five to
ten with five to
seven ten seconds break between each one
it's fine to count that as four sets
totally fine because even if it's not a
stimulative as four sets it's gonna be
close
uh it sure as hell gonna be as fatiguing
right because
that many failure approaches that soon
beats you the fuck up
what about giant sets and occlusion sets
well giant sets you never really get
very close to failure it's all about my
muscle
those uh probably aren't as difficult
and as fatiguing
and what about occlusion sets well
occlusion definitely stimulates some
hypertrophy but probably not as much as
regular training because the load is so
small
probably doesn't cause nearly as much
fatigue because the load is so small
so those might count like a two-thirds
to one in both stimulus and fatigue
we have to do some averaging here
because we're trying to get stimulus and
fatigue in the same number
but essentially two-thirds to one which
means
that you know if you if it takes you uh
like six total sets
right or let's say yeah it takes uh it
takes you six total sets
of uh a giant set you know to get to
where you're going
you probably can count that as four sets
equivalent to straight sets because none
of this that's worth that stimulator for
that fatiguing same with occlusion
right agonist supersets people would say
okay you did a set of skull crushers and
a set of close grip that should count as
two
but you know it should definitely not
count as just one because it's
doing a superstar it's way more stimulus
and fatigue than doing just one working
set because you're going beyond failure
and continuing to go in a mechanically
more advantageous position but you do
involve other muscles and you do tax
that muscle more
so i think somewhere between the two one
and a half count is very good
so if you do you know something like six
supersets against supersets six sets of
skulls to close grip bench that probably
roughly equates to about nine sets of
triceps think of it something like that
right
now this is just a guide for you to get
to thinking about this if you want a
precision count
you've got to individualize this based
on raw stimulus magnitude and fatigue in
your experience
so somebody could say hey a superset
counts at 1.5 you do a superset you
barely feel a thing
a straight set was even better for you
obviously that super set doesn't count
as 1.5 it counts more like
one right and so on and so forth you
have to use auto regulation to make sure
you're doing everything really good
okay so that's how it would count in
fractional counting
for method number three
okay so methods one and this is uh
methods one and two
we would do um
the fractional counting right for this
kind of thing method three the simple
method
everything counts as one to one okay
superset counts as one to one
uh and so do giant sets and so on and so
forth for that simplicity factor
let's take a look at how that plays out
so
when we have an advanced method of
counting like method one
or a very advanced method of counting
like method two
why would we ever pick method three in
the simple count
strange right because we clearly is more
precise
maybe no less accurate seems like it's
worthwhile
well first argument as to why a simple
count might be advantageous for most
people
one raw stimulus magnitudes and fatigues
are so different between exercises
anyway
okay if you say okay i need 20 sets of
quads
per week to stimulate my quads well and
stay under my mrv
someone can say okay is that leg
extensions or squats and you're like
shit well it's probably like 15 sets of
squats but 25 sets of leg extensions
and whoever does those
exercises at their expense anyway you
almost never do a program of only squats
or leg extensions you probably do some
mix of both
right which is to say that that 20
becomes accurate again
right so if you get super precise and
counting
you're essentially pretending you know
more than what you actually know
right you're saying okay i need exactly
this number and someone's like what
about if the exercises are different
they're like well they needed a very
very different number
and then so why are you even collecting
that data because it might just be
useless to you
right second point
to muddle the picture a bit volume
landmarks m e v m or v so on and so
forth change over the weeks
over diets and over the long term right
so if you have a general guess with a
simple counting of like roughly 10 sets
of chests
on average per workout per session
versus if you have a 12.5 from the super
precision counting
that 10 is basically just as good as a
12.5
because the volume landmarks change over
the week some weeks you're tired and you
can do
13. uh so you're tired and you could do
nine some weeks you're fresh you can do
13
um over diet so hypo versus hyper versus
iso caloric
there could be one or two or three or
four even set differences in those
numbers
and over time you know you're like my
mrv is 12.5
for chest per session like it was that
last mesocycle
or five measures ago what is it now like
you know
you're collecting an inordinate amount
of data now to keep these things up to
date
where basically all of these things
range within this range right they range
up and down
up and down you got this big range here
that maybe is as big as about
three to five sets your mrv is not like
below eight and it's not above 13 but
can someone say it's definitely not 10
it's for sure 11
it's all in this range right and so
because we know what's in this range any
counting that is more precise here
versus there versus here versus there
is really just lost in the noise it's
not enough signal and too much noise
anyway so there's definitely something
to say for that general guess is pretty
much as
good as we can hope for um and
essentially
precision suffers from like a
significant figures problem
you guys might remember from chemistry
like you calculate a temperature
and you do the division and it's like
well it's 13.75 degrees celsius
okay and then your chemistry professor
asks you okay how accurate is the
thermometer you're using
like um it only goes to one decimal
place is where the fuck did you get the
0.5 from you're like
well that's what the math said like yeah
but you're making up a number that you
didn't actually measure like
right okay so you could say well it was
12.5 as my mrv and someone's like on
what day
today or yesterday hyper or isocaloric
week one or week three of your meso and
all of a sudden
we got a range right like dr james
hoffman says all the time on
uh the webinars uh the volume
lamborghini ranges they're not specific
exact points theoretically they're exact
but practically we can't know those
things so maybe if we're collecting a
ton of data for that it's not really a
good idea
here's another really awesome thing
autoregulation within the mesocycle
smooths
all of this out like if you said okay
i have an mev of exactly
8.5 sets of chest or something like that
and you train chest and because the
exercises are different or whatever
you feel basically nothing clearly you
were fucking wrong
and then clearly you should probably do
like 10 cents and then when you do 10
sets you get a bit of a burn bit of a
pump so and so forth and all of a sudden
you're correct now
right and then if you don't auto
regulate all the most precision in the
world is only precise for one time and
you might even be guessing wrong that
one time
but let's say you're right about one
micro cycle things change
with micro cycle if you do auto
regulation whatever rough guess you take
is going to be altered after but if you
take a super precise guess you only ever
need it once
so you can imagine collecting all this
crazy crazy data
that all it does is get you one set
closer to precise in the first
microcycle and after that it's all a
wash anyway because auto regulation
takes over
don't bother with that start with a
rough guess in your first micro cycle
even go a little bit on the charitable
side conservative side
and then auto regulation is going to
tell you everything you need to know
anyway
so you don't have to collect these super
super precise data points
right and lastly and we sort of alluded
to this earlier
most of your programs look pretty
similar anyway people say like okay
well dips do they count for chester for
triceps well is there a time
in your program where you're not doing
close grip dumbbell press close grip
bench press
dips or close grip push-ups you're like
no i always have some version of that so
what the fuck are you counting it for
chest
you just count your direct chest work
and then just assume that you're always
going to have
some ancillary work from chest coming in
from tricep training
it's going to happen every time now it's
going to happen a little more every time
a little less
but back to point three that's where
auto regulation takes care of that right
so you assumed
a certain amount of chest work is going
to get done ancillary in your first
micro cycle but this time it was more
wide grip dips than usual and your
stress got a little bit more sore than
you thought
so you just don't increase chest volume
as much in week number two it's a one
week solved
problem as opposed to collecting mounds
of data and still having to auto
regulate rates for nothing
at the end of the day so here is the
last and final step
the solution here is to keep things only
as complex
as you can use if you're collecting tons
of fractional data
stop okay you have to have awareness of
your sfrs
you have to track and essentially update
how to regulate your programmers
is it stimulating enough is it fatiguing
enough for what we want
you have all the data you need every
single week and even if you count
you know your sets as any weird thing
you can always update it you know
fundamentally you know when a muscle you
know if you're doing close grips and
you're counting against triceps you know
you're like
this is this hit my pecs a little bit
you don't have to count that
but just know for next week like next
week you're who should i do inclined for
four sets or five cents you know what
my pecs are pretty well messed up from
close grip i'm just gonna do it for four
it's
that easy just the general it's all auto
regulation from there
the ultimate example of this is someone
is like you know
is my back you know 17 mrv or
or is my back like you know 19 mrv and
and you're like uh you know i've
fortunately been through this before we
take a real long time to answer and i
sort of explained this
and they're like okay and they and they
message you a week later and they're
like hey man
look i i just skipped my workouts like
this week because i had final exams
what do you think i should do like
motherfucker you're actually skipping
workouts and you worry about one set
versus another you just missed 17
fucking cents in a week
who gives a shit if it's 17 or 19. it's
now 15 because you're de-trained
so you don't want to bite them off more
than you can chew if you're a super
high-level bodybuilder
you can use more advanced uh fractional
accounting if you want
but again we said earlier a lot of those
folks are so in tune with what's going
on and modified exercises so much
that they mostly just use one-to-one
anyway uh
if you're uh you know any old other
person you know regular
person just trying to get in shape use
the simplest method
until unless you need something more
complex hopefully to answer some
questions folks
see you next time
you
