over the course of a 12-week fat loss
phase you could be looking at as much as
seven to eight pounds of extra fat loss
just by incorporating this one simple
thing into your day
assuming you do it properly using the
tips that i'm going to give you here in
a second
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today we're going to be going over
one simple but highly effective and
quite honestly
very easy daily habit to help you lose
fat and lean down more efficiently this
is not some
silly workout gimmick or diet hack or
magical fat loss supplement based on a
top secret biological loophole
discovered by harvard scientists
you guys know that we don't do any of
that bs here okay this is a real
legitimate strategy and it was actually
one of the key things i really made sure
to focus on
during my last fat loss phase and it
definitely had a big impact on my
results
so what am i talking about here
the answer is walking now don't click
away just yet
i know that's not the most exciting
thing in the world but this really is a
serious topic and it's something that
can definitely make a significant
difference to your fat burning progress
if you implement it in the way that i'll
be explaining here so
keep watching and i'll cover the four
key benefits of using walking for fat
loss
i'll also give you a few strategies that
you can use to implement more walking
into your day
to make it as simple and as effortless
as possible and to be fair i'll also
mention a couple of potential warnings
you could say
so just little potential downsides to
watch out for and what to do about them
so the first benefit of using
walking as a primary fat loss tool is
that it allows you to burn a significant
number of calories
while putting minimal stress on your
body as a whole
regular traditional cardio sessions are
of course fine to do and i encourage you
to incorporate at least some of that
into your week
but there's only so much running or
stair stepping or rowing or intervals
you can do
before it starts to potentially backfire
higher volumes of cardio are going to
create
more overall systemic stress more muscle
damage more joint stress
and at a certain point that can start
negatively impacting your
recovery after weight training workouts
and even impair your performance on
upcoming workouts
whereas with walking you're not really
going to get any of that it's just very
easy on your body
and if anything it can actually improve
your recovery and even improve your
joint health as well the second benefit
of walking is that
because it's just a very gentle activity
to perform it also doesn't produce the
same level of psychological fatigue
compared to more intense forms of
exercise so you can go for a walk and
get that calorie expenditure that you're
after without feeling mentally exhausted
afterwards in a way that could then
negatively carry over to
other things that you need to do during
the day like work or school or
social obligations or things like that
so walking allows you to burn calories
without draining your willpower the
third benefit of walking is that it's a
very sustainable activity it's just
very easy to stick to and that's
absolutely crucial
because if you really don't like the
type of exercise that you're doing it's
only going to be a matter of time before
you burn out and quit
now some people do enjoy those more
traditional forms of cardio but
a pretty decent percentage of people
don't and some people even flat out hate
it whereas with walking
it's not something that you're going to
need to psych yourself up for you're not
going to be sitting around
dreading the fact that you have to go
for a walk later in the day and
many find that once they get into the
daily habit walking is actually
something they genuinely enjoy
and that they look forward to you sir
and benefit number four and this is a
huge one which is that walking is not
going to have the same
appetite stimulating effect compared to
more strenuous forms of cardio you know
you can run on the treadmill and burn
say 500 calories but that's really not
gonna do you any good if it causes your
hunger to spike up in the hours
afterwards
and then you just go and replace those
same 500 calories through your diet or
possibly even more than that
which is a really easy thing to do if
you aren't careful now this doesn't mean
that you're not going to be hungry at
all okay a calorie deficit will always
stimulate your appetite to some degree
but it just won't be as dramatic when
you're using walking as a primary
calorie burning tool
and as a result that's going to help you
maintain an overall calorie deficit more
easily now there are a few things to
watch out for here which i'll explain in
a minute
but the bottom line is that when it all
comes down to it fat loss is about
maintaining a calorie deficit you have
to consistently expend
more calories than you consume okay it's
calories in versus calories out
and what walking allows you to do is tip
that calories out portion of the
equation
in your favor but without the potential
side effects that can come from doing
higher volumes of
more strenuous cardio you know you can
practically walk as much as you want
and get that extra calorie expenditure
but without running into issues
with systemic stress muscle damage joint
stress or excessive appetite stimulation
now that's all well and good
but you might be thinking that since
walking is such a light activity
how many calories am i really going to
burn doing that and yeah
per unit of time it's obviously going to
be a lot less in comparison to
say running or swimming or biking or
something along those lines
however when you extrapolate it over the
course of an entire day
it really does add up a lot especially
if you're relatively sedentary right now
outside of weight training so how many
calories
does walking burn well a lot of
different factors come into play
but just as one basic example if you
took say a 180 pound male
who burns around 50 calories per 1000
steps at a moderate pace
and they increased their daily step
count by 5 000 which is not a huge
amount
pretty simple to do that in most cases
that's 250
extra calories burned per day which
translates to 1
750 calories per week or roughly 7
500 calories per month and since 1 pound
of fat contains roughly 3 500 calories
that would equal out to just over two
pounds of extra fat loss per month
which is not insignificant at all
especially when you add it up over the
course of several months
and of course there's nothing stopping
you from adding more than 5 000 extra
steps depending on your current
situation if it was even just a bit
higher than that
then over the course of a 12 week fat
loss phase
you could be looking at as much as seven
to eight pounds of extra fat loss
just by incorporating this one simple
thing into your day
assuming you do it properly using the
tips that i'm going to give you here in
a second

it really helps to support the channel
so i can keep putting out this free
content every week but yeah not only can
you burn a significant number of
calories
just through walking alone but the best
part is that because this is something
you're already doing to some extent
throughout your day as
is all you really need to do is find
ways to maximize it in order to get your
total step count up
into an effective range i think for most
people in most situations
around 8 000 steps per day would be the
bare minimum to aim for
if this is something that you want to
take seriously 10 000 steps would
probably be more appropriate to use as
your baseline and then from there you
can decide
just how high you want to go whether
it's 12 000 15 000 or
possibly even more than that you know
there's no real upper limit here
it just comes down to you as far as your
own personal preferences
and how many extra calories you're
aiming to burn now what are the best
strategies to use
to reach your targeted step count in the
most efficient way
well first off you can of course just go
for regular scheduled walks right simple
as that you could do shorter walks more
often maybe
10 to 15 minutes periodically throughout
the day maybe after meals for example
or you could do longer walks in the 30
to 60 minute range but just do it less
often and i personally enjoy
doing structured walks like this i find
it mentally beneficial in terms of
just helping me organize my thoughts
come up with new ideas
some of my best business insights or
even just life insights in general
tend to come when i'm out walking and
another option
if you find walking to be a bit boring
and you want to maximize its
utility then you can just throw on a
podcast or listen to youtube videos
that way you're being even more
efficient by getting the benefits of the
walking itself
plus learning new information at the
same time and that's something that's
also a lot harder to do
during more intense cardio sessions
because your mind has to stay focused on
the actual workout now aside from
structured walks outside or even
on a treadmill if you prefer that for
some reason uh maybe if it's uh too hot
or too cold outside
but aside from that you can also just
take your existing daily schedule
and find more ways to add steps into it
for example if you
normally drive to work or to the gym or
wherever else
if it's a shorter ways away then if it's
feasible for you to walk there instead
that would be one very simple option or
if you are driving then
there's also the standard advice of
parking further away
once you're inside taking the stairs
instead of the elevator
and these things might sound kind of
silly and insignificant but you really
have to think in terms of extrapolating
these small things over the day
as a whole so some other ideas during
work sessions you can take periodic
breaks to
stand up and get some steps in that's
probably just good for your body in
general anyway
you can walk while you brush your teeth
or if you're on the phone another big
one that i use a lot is to walk in
between sets at the gym so rather than
just sitting there and scrolling on your
phone or talking or
doing nothing at all just stand up and
walk around you know over the course of
say
a 60 to 90 minute wait training session
if you make a concerted effort to get
some steps in while you're not lifting
it really does add up quite a bit you
can also make walking
a social activity you know if you're
supposed to meet someone for
a coffee you could suggest getting your
coffee to go and taking a walk instead
and this last one might sound a bit
goofy but you can also literally just
walk around your house i actually did
this quite a bit during my last fat loss
phase when i was really trying to
maximize my step count where
it would get toward the end of the day
and i hadn't hit my targeted number yet
so i just put on some youtube videos and
basically walk laps around the living
room until i got there and that brings
me to another very important point
which is that if walking is something
you really want to incorporate into your
day and take seriously
you ideally do want to be tracking your
steps because when you have a set target
in place and you can physically see how
many steps you've taken so far
it really holds you accountable and
gives you a gauge to work with
throughout the day
for example if it's late afternoon and
you've been a bit lazy and you can see
that the step count is lower than normal
that's your reminder to step things up a
bit so that you're not trying to cram
everything in
later on now you could use the step
counter on your phone but
it's not going to be perfectly accurate
since you're probably not carrying your
phone
in your pocket every single place you go
and so i would recommend just buying a
basic
watch to track it for you you don't need
anything heavy duty here
i bought this one off of amazon for like
20 bucks and it's been working for me
just fine
but this definitely is a worthwhile
investment and it can really make all
the difference between
consistently getting your walking in
every day versus just gradually falling
off track with it and one final thing i
should also mention is that
as beneficial as walking can be and as
much as i recommend it
this doesn't necessarily mean that you
should use it as a complete replacement
for all other forms of cardio
now you can technically do that if you
want but just keep in mind that
like i already mentioned before walking
is going to be less efficient in terms
of calories burned per unit of time so
if you do want to burn
through a larger number of calories
within a shorter window then a standard
more intense cardio session is of course
going to be more effective
in that regard in addition to that keep
in mind that walking is not going to
give you the same
cardiovascular conditioning benefits
that more intense cardio will
if you really want to improve your
conditioning in a significant way
you need to stress your cardiovascular
system in order to create those
adaptations and walking on its own is
not going to be enough for that and
neither will most
traditional hypertrophy style weight
training workouts either so if you're
looking to
optimize your overall health and fitness
in addition to building muscle and
losing fat
then ideally you should still be getting
in at least a couple of regular cardio
sessions during the week that really get
your breathing and your heart rate up
and to close this whole thing out
a very very important point okay yes
walking has a wide variety of benefits
but always remember that fat loss still
ultimately comes down to calories in
versus calories out in the overall
picture so you can burn as many calories
as you want through walking
but if your diet isn't on point if
you're just consuming too many calories
and you're replacing
everything that you burn from walking
and you're not in a net calorie deficit
when it all comes down to it
you're still not going to lose fat so
your diet should always be front and
center in the fat burning process
it's the most important factor of all if
you're not properly managing
your calorie intake you're probably not
going to get very far
so get your diet properly dialed in get
your weight training plan
correctly mapped out and then add
walking into the mix to maximize things
even further but don't rely on it as a
sole fat burning tool and as far as
training and nutrition is concerned
