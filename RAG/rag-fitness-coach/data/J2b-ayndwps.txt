I have a couple tips for Mr Sam one is
to control the Ecentric the downward
motion considerably more it's very
growth promoting and because controlling
it more asks your muscles to work harder
it's harder to control it it provides a
great deal of hypertrophic stimulus
another thing is to go as deep as
possible for the biggest stretch it's
been shown time and time again now with
good theory and empirical support that
big stretches under big loads grow the
muscle more than if you stop a little
shy you want to really let your entire
back get folded out and then crunch it
back
in
