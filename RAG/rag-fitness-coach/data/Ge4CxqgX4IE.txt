I was on a flight once with my boy a man
of Dominican descent Marcos Rodriguez
that's he say his name and he's an elite
personal trainer in New York City look
him up anyway we were sitting next to
this very nice very professional Indian
lady who's like a of course a
computational chemist or some like
that why not and we were sitting in an
airplane and she's like hey like you
know my son is younger and he's uh what
do you think about creatine he wants to
take creatine should I let him and
before I could say any sport Science
 Marcos real quick cuz he's got that
New Yorker Dominican wit so he's just
way faster than me so he goes I don't
put that poison in my body and she's
like oh okay and I was
like he's joking and she was like he is
and I was like it's not poison you're
going to be totally cool if you're over
the age of she's for sure 18 but
probably 15 you're totally fine to take
it expect some water weight gains it's
totally cool after a week they'll
stabilize and then you'll just have
slightly better body composition
strength recovery and all that good
stuff
