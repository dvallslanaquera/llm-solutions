what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and today i'm
going to be responding to a recent
video from alexander leonidas better
known as alpha destiny
and the video is entitled strength
training for size it makes
sense where he gives some general advice
regarding
strength and hypertrophy training and
the relationship between the two so
let's go through this video and i'm
going to give you my thoughts and my
perspective
on the points that he makes okay do i
personally agree or
disagree um alex has been around the
youtube fitness scene for a lot of years
now and his videos do reach a fairly
wide audience and so i think that this
is a good subject to cover
and there's some really important stuff
in here that a lot of you probably need
to hear
so i would suggest watching this video
all the way through and just as a side
note
i've sped up the clips from his video by
25 just to make this a bit shorter
overall so
let's jump into it if your main goal is
to build lots of muscle and look massive
i still think that pursuing strength
training makes a lot of sense let me
explain why right now so the first thing
i'll say is that progressive overload is
absolutely key
i don't care how much you focus on my
muscle connection tut and optimal volume
if progression is not taking place over
time you'll likely
not grow so i don't think it's any
surprise to those who follow my channel
that i would
definitely agree with those statements
i'd go as far as to say that a muscle
building program
is a strength training program at heart
because you ultimately can't separate
them
keep in mind that strength doesn't just
mean how much maximal weight you can
lift in a very low rep range okay even
if you go from lifting
a lighter weight for 19 reps up to 20
reps
that's still an increase in strength if
you go from doing a small isolation
exercise like a lateral raise
with 10 kilogram dumbbells up to 12 and
a half kilogram dumbbells
that is an increase in strength if you
can lift a given weight in a more
mechanically challenging position
than you did last time or use a slower
negative or implement a pause
that is also an increase in strength and
these are all forms of progressive
overload
and as alex said progressive overload is
key for growth and i'd go even further
to say
that if you don't progress it's not just
likely that you won't grow
you literally won't grow there has to be
some form of progressive stimulus on the
muscle over time
in order to create new adaptations even
if it's just something as small as an
extra half rep
or an extra one second pause or one more
pound on the bar
but bottom line if you are training for
muscle growth then you're also training
for strength by default fact is there
needs to be some objective metric to
know that we're actually making progress
not just spinning our wheels which is
all too common nowadays
because you can't separate size of
strength even though a lot of marketers
will tell you otherwise allow me to
simplify like this if your numbers are
going down
you're probably losing muscle mass if
your numbers are maintaining you're
probably not gaining an additional size
and if they're improving say taking your
bench from 185 to 275
you probably gain a good amount of size
so there's no doubt about that
and one way that i've put it before is
that your training logbook
essentially represents your levels of
muscle mass but in mathematical form
it's like the numbers in those logs are
directly correlated
to your existing muscular capacity and
assuming that you're forming your
technique is on point and that it's
being kept consistent
then if the numbers here are steadily
going up you know you're performing more
work over time in some capacity
then your levels of muscle mass are also
going to be steadily going up
and vice versa now that doesn't mean
that the correlation is going to be
exactly the same for everyone
genetics do play a role here and not
everybody who can
say dumbbell press a hundreds for six
reps is gonna have the exact same chest
size okay
i'm just talking relative to you as an
individual and the thing is it doesn't
matter what we're feeling
nor does the mirror make a difference in
this case because we already know that
building muscle as a natural is a slow
process
look at those muscle gaining calculators
every year it gets slower and slower so
it's not like
every two months you're gonna say oh my
god i gained point five inches on my
biceps i mean it could happen but at a
certain point
that progression is slowed down the
visual progression is what i'm talking
about here whereas
strength can still occur far more
rapidly depending what exercise you're
performing
right and this is why i've been
repeating like pretty much a broken
record for the past decade
that as a natural lifter tracking your
lifts is so important because like alex
is talking about here
once you're past the newbie gain phase
muscle growth is going to be happening
so slowly that it's going to be
extremely difficult if not
impossible for you to measure it just by
looking at yourself in the mirror or
even by taking objective measurements
you know you can't just perform a few
workouts for a few weeks
and then check visually to see if it's
working on the other hand
strength gains are going to be
measurable in the short term you know
unless you're
really advanced then they're usually
going to be measurable on a workout to
workout basis
and since size and strength are so
closely intertwined
that's how you know that what you're
doing is working you don't need visual
confirmation
if you come back to the gym and you're
able to do slightly more than last time
in whatever capacity it can just be a
very small improvement
that is your evidence right there that
you are in fact building new muscle
even though it's not going to be
visually perceptible yet the strength
gain is what confirms that for you
and the muscle gain will become visually
perceptible but just over a longer term
period
as those small increases in strength
accumulate i'm not saying you can't make
gains without tracking your workouts
objectively but it's just going to be a
much more efficient process if you do
and that's what makes a difference
long-term motivation-wise since the
games are so freaking slow
and size-wise you can't tell me that a
guy who improves his numbers by a
significant margin is not going to look
bigger it can't happen it won't happen
yeah the only people who
really claim that adding significant
weight to the bar over time won't
also add significant muscle to your
frame over time are the people who
either don't know what they're talking
about or they're the people who are
trying to sell you some sort of gimmick
but no experienced natural lifter who
has actually built a solid physique
they're not going to doubt that
everybody scatters way differently and
there is genetics to consider
but still if i take your strict curl
from 95 pounds to 135 pounds you don't
have to second guess
you have to pull out the measuring tape
the objective numbers prove to you
that you gain muscle and you know that
you're gaining size because progressive
overload
whether it's evidence of hypertrophy or
the actual driver itself doesn't matter
we gotta induce it to a certain extent
so i have seen this question come up
before
is progressive overload the result of
hypertrophy or is it the driver of
hypertrophy and i would say
that it's not one or the other it's
actually both it's both the result
and it's also the driver if you barbell
row 200 pounds for eight reps and you
come back to the gym next time
and you barbell row 200 pounds for nine
reps
the fact that you were capable of
increasing to nine reps
that is the result of the previous
workout it's the evidence that muscle
growth has taken place between
then and now and then the fact that you
actually physically executed those nine
reps
it's also the stimulus that's then going
to allow you to do 10 reps the next time
so i just see it as this never ending
feedback loop so anyway another point i
want to stress is that with strength
training
you're always focusing on the
fundamentals the exercise that i've
stood the test of time for the most part
the squat
bench press deadlift barbell row
overhead press way to pull up weighted
dip
the big heavy compounds the barbell
curls as well your barbell extension
it's classic stuff that can be done with
straight weights and dumbbells and the
variations that those entail whether it
be by
changing the angles like doing an
incline bench or a floor press
or even modifying the strength curve
regardless they're all exercises that
work and will absolutely not fail you
it's not something that you just created
at the top of your head it's not some
gimmicky movement that some marketer is
trying to sell you so it's always good
to see somebody else
um hammering the same point as well i've
been talking a lot about this
in my videos lately so most of you
already know my stance on this which is
the fact that as a natural lifter
your program should be centered around
the basic proven compound lifts
first and foremost sure you could still
make gains doing nothing but isolation
movements if you really wanted to for
some reason
you could still make chest gains by
doing reverse grip
twisting cable presses while lying on a
bosu ball
oh it's a deep burn oh it's so
deep but it's not going to be optimal
and we don't need to reinvent the wheel
here
so many of these new and innovative
improved lifts that you see plastered
all over youtube and all over instagram
they're really just marketing fluff at
the end of the day the basics
are not very sexy they don't sell very
well and so people just have to keep
coming up with this
endless novel content to really get the
clicks and the views and the attention
and most of the people showing this
stuff in their instagram swipe workouts
or their
uh top six rear delt exercises you must
do
or your shoulders will shrivel up and
fall onto the gym floor and your
girlfriend will
cheat on you with the front desk guy
those guys probably never even did this
stuff to build most of their muscle mass
and they probably don't even do most of
it now now that said my argument is not
that these new movements are bad in fact
some of them are quite genius and i
would absolutely recommend them
rather it's all about simplifying the
process and we know that the basics work
so why not just rely on that
now i'm glad that alex brought that up
because that's a point that i wanted to
clarify as well
uh some people might see my content
where i really hammer the basic
fundamentals and they think that i'm
saying that you should only ever do
classical lifts and
any modified version or any attempt to
improve on them at all
is just complete blasphemy and a total
gimmick but that's really not what i'm
saying
my emphasis on the basics is more so a
push back
against all of this endless bs fluff
content that we're seeing more and more
of nowadays that's trying to swing the
pendulum
all the way to the extreme and act like
the basic lifts are outdated or that
they don't work or that the weight on
the bar doesn't matter
and you need a million different fancy
mind muscle connection exercises if you
want to make gains
what i'm trying to do is bring people
back here into a more reasonable middle
ground i'm not trying to send them all
the way off over here
and claim that everything is set in
stone forever and that there's no way
you could ever
improve on anything and that middle
ground means that yes you can experiment
with different exercise variations here
and there
you can take your own individual body
structure and find ways of performing
certain lifts that feels best for you
uh of course we should always strive for
improvement and strive to optimize our
training
and find ways to advance the general
pool of training knowledge further
but the central point is just that the
basic fundamental compound lifts
with a focus on progressive overload
that should still form the underlying
foundation of your training you
absolutely cannot and will not go wrong
with that some guys will tell you the
basics
don't work that you're wasting your time
that this is a better way and that
advice might have good intentions in
some cases but
it often confuses lifters and leads them
down a path where they're really not
growing at all
because they're not getting stronger at
the fundamentals a lot of guys don't
have a foundation and if they do they're
wasting your time on movements that are
far less efficient or
exercise that haven't quite tested time
yet the basics work and they won't
fail you all right and strength training
is all about that because let's keep it
real there's only so many ways that you
can curl or press
yeah that's the thing too it's like even
if there is some room for little tweaks
and small improvements on certain
exercises
there's still going to be a pretty
limited window in terms of how much you
can realistically modify a given
movement
and how much benefit that's actually
going to give you in the real world
for example if you take a small muscle
group like your biceps with a pretty
straightforward function
if you've got all of your basic compound
back training in place
that you're getting steadily stronger at
especially on things like weighted
pull-ups
and you're doing a couple of different
curling variations uh during the week
that feel comfortable for you
you know full range of motion solid
technique without excessive use of
momentum
you're engaging the biceps and you're
applying steady progressive overload
with that right there you've done the
vast vast majority of what you need to
do
and of what is even possible to maximize
your biceps growth
and any extra little form tweaks and
pinky twists and cable attachment
choices
at best that's only gonna make a small
difference and i think that
following a structured routine that's
been systematically designed to improve
your performance
makes a lot of sense because at the end
of the day what allows us to
remain consistent and maximize
progressive overload is always going to
be a great option i'd much rather you
run something like that
compared to a program that was written
by some jim bro who's probably taken a
bunch of roads as well
because these just up the dose they use
the highest volume of which they can
handle
they run a basic bro split and they
fluff and pump it and they just get
massive and when real naturals try to
train like that
they often experience all kinds of
plateaus keep in mind that generally
speaking
the fitness influencers who get the most
views and the most attention generally
are going to be the ones with the most
impressive physiques that's what allows
them to rise all the way up to the very
top
it's not based on who gives the most
accurate information
since most of the people who are
consuming this content they don't even
know
what's accurate and what's not in the
first place that's why they're searching
for the information to begin with
and the youtube and the instagram
algorithm it does not distinguish
between accuracy of information it only
looks
at what is capturing the greatest amount
of raw attention
in terms of clicks and in terms of
viewing duration and if you're going to
have a top
0.0001 physique that also means
that in most cases you either have elite
genetics or you're enhanced
or very often a combination of both and
it's not that there aren't
genetically elite enhanced lifters out
there who are also very knowledgeable
okay there definitely
are but very often that is not the case
because most of the guys who fall into
that category are going to get great
results regardless of how they train
now it's just objective progress they're
either getting better performance wise
or you're not
and if you ain't you got to ask why and
that's when we dial things in further
you become a much
smarter lifter in this way you can look
at those papers you can look at those
workout logs
you see it like we talked about earlier
muscle growth happens very slowly
whereas strength can be tracked
accurately in the short term
and so not only do consistent strength
gains uh mean that your muscle building
efforts are on the right track but it's
also going to be a way to identify if
your program
isn't working so that you can make the
appropriate adjustments if you're just
relying on the mirror or on your
measurements
then it could take months before you
wake up and realize that you're not
actually making any gains
whereas if you're tracking your strength
progress in an objective way
then if you're not making any gains
you're going to be able to see it very
quickly in just a matter of a few weeks
you know just think about how much time
and effort that could potentially save
you
do you really want to train for three or
four months straight or more
and then realize that your program isn't
working when instead you could just keep
workout logs and within
maybe three weeks or less you could come
to the same realization and get yourself
onto the proper track
i think the answer is pretty obvious
there you know what we're committed to
this we're giving this game for life
so we might as well do it right instead
of just spinning our wheels all the time
which i'm not in favor of so i think
that was a great video by alex
just generally summarizing some of the
key overarching principles behind
effective hypertrophy training for
natural lifters there's just so
much out there in the fitness
industry nowadays fake natties
natural lifters who are on trt and
outright
genetically elite enhanced bodybuilders
who really just have no clue how to
coach natural lifters
who don't even understand very basic
training principles
and unfortunately this is going to lead
a lot of people down the wrong path
so i'm always happy to see videos like
this from legit naturals who actually
know what they're talking about if you
want to grab what i consider to be
the optimal training system in order to
take these overarching general
principles
and actually apply them in a structured
way so that you can gain muscle as
efficiently as possible then make sure
