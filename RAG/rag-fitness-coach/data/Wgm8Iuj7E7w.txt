how do skull crushers develop the
triceps brandow and colleagues had
previously untrained men perform skull
crushers for three to five sets of reps
to failure with an eighty percent warner
max load twice per week for ten weeks
the medial and long heads grew
significantly while their lateral head
hardly grew
wakahara and colleagues found similar
results
they found during dumbbell triceps skull
crushers activation of the lateral head
measured by t2 weighted imaging was much
lower than the medial and long head
activation
therefore
skull crushers are likely great at
growing the long and medial triceps
heads but poor for the lateral head
