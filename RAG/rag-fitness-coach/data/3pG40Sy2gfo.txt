when you stretch a muscle out to a long
muscle length and you impose a shitload
of tension during that time it probably
causes more hypertrophy than like
imposing tension at any other part of
the muscle length including like when
the muscle is short so for example if
you put a lot of tension here on the
bicep it maybe grow the bicep more than
like having a lot of tension right here
milking a super deep stretch might be
even in some cases even in many cases
more effective than even full range of
motion crazy
do we need to change the name of the
full ROM forum and team full ROM no
because the whole thing's a joke
anyway but kind of neat and at the very
least the exploring a deep painful
stretch in a variety of exercises is a
good idea
