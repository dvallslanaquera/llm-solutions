all right welcome everyone to a new
episode of the full body science applied
series
in this video we're going to be hitting
the fifth and final full body workout of
the week on our new high frequency full
body split
and as always if this split doesn't make
much sense to you i'll link a few videos
in the description box below that'll get
you up to speed
and today even though we're hitting the
full body we're going to be focusing
primarily on the
delts by hitting our shoulders earlier
in the workout and with slightly more
volume so we're kicking things off with
three sets of six reps on the barbell
overhead press
now oddly enough despite being one of
the single best measures of upper body
strength in my opinion
the ohp has recently come under scrutiny
with some people going so far as to say
it's simply
not a good exercise for developing the
shoulders i think the reasoning here is
that because it's such a front delt
dominant movement and your front delts
already get plenty of activation from
any horizontal pressing in your routine
including a vertical press is pretty
much redundant and while i can't see
where that's coming from
and i do think bodybuilders tend to over
emphasize the front delts
this isn't an opinion that i personally
share first of all even though the front
delts will be carrying
most of the load it isn't like the
lateral and rear heads just completely
turn off and go to sleep while vertical
pressing
just look at this figure from
sederbacken and colleagues in the
standing barbell press even though the
front delts were the most active you're
still seeing significant activation of
the side delts and some activation of
the rear delts as well
also from a strength perspective i do
see a vertical press as one of the few
fundamental movement patterns that
should be integrated into any complete
training program
to prevent overuse injury and to develop
raw strength in the frontal plane now it
doesn't need to be a barbell press
you can use dumbbells if you find them
to be more comfortable the main point is
that prioritizing some kind of vertical
press on a shoulder focus day
is a good idea so one of the things i've
been focusing on lately is thinking
about pushing through the outside of my
hands
rather than the insides i think this
does two things
first it prevents my grip from gradually
slipping out and second it helps me
prioritize shoulder
abduction so you can think of it like
this if you were to do a set of dumbbell
shoulder press while pressing the
dumbbells
up and out it would be a lot harder than
pressing them up and
in so by placing the brunt of the force
on the outside of my palms
i'm able to cue for the same basic
movement pattern now obviously the bar
is fixed so my hands won't actually move
in like they would with dumbbells
but i still find this cue helps my
shoulders function in their strongest
position
throughout the range of motion the
second thing i've been focusing on is
keeping my elbows tucked at about a 45
degree angle at the bottom
but then i'll flare them out a bit more
as the bar clears my face
and i find this helps me get the bar
back over the shoulder joint
reducing the moment arm between the load
and the joint and making the lift more
efficient overall now in terms of
progression one thing i like to do here
is start with three sets of six
and then simply add one set each week
until you get to five sets of six
with the same weight in week three and
then in week four go back to three sets
of six again
but now you'll add some weight and i
like this progression scheme for ohp in
particular because a lot of people hit a
wall with ohp strength progression as
they get more advanced
meaning there will come a point where
realistically adding some weight
week to week or even adding just one rep
week to week just won't be feasible
anymore
so adding sets to accumulate volume
first is a great workaround to keep
driving strength forward
all right we've got a nice few exercises
to get through in this workout so i'm
going to move a bit more quickly from
here forward
um so after that we're moving on to
three sets of 15 reps on the dumbbell
lateral raise now one thing i've been
really emphasizing in this series so far
is the importance of
managing fatigue throughout the week
this is especially important on a high
frequency full body split where you're
hitting
some of the same muscles on consecutive
training days one consideration we've
discussed a lot is not taking too many
sets all the way to failure
and moderating your effort in the gym
especially when you first start a high
frequency protocol
but another equally important
consideration is exercise selection
and distribution exercises that load
more in a stretched position
tend to cause more muscle damage while
exercises that load more
in the contracted position tend to cause
less muscle damage
in our last workout we did the cable
lateral raise which applies a high level
of tension in both the stretched
position
at the bottom and in the contracted
position at the top so in this workout
we're doing the dumbbell lateral raise
instead
where tension is practically zero in the
stretch position but
maximal in the contracted position at
the top now this isn't something to
overthink
and it probably doesn't make a huge
difference for an exercise like a
lateral raise but as a general principle
i do think we can push an exercise like
a dumbbell lateral raise
much closer to failure without seeing as
much fatigue and we can apply that same
general principle to other exercises
and if you're interested in some more
tips on the lateral raise in general
i'll link my technique tuesday video
down below instead of covering those
details again here all right up next
we're doing three sets of 12 on the
seated cable row now this is one of my
favorite so called mind muscle
connection based movements for the back
because it's so easy to alter the
movement to be more trap dominant
or more lat dominant depending on what
you're trying to target specifically
personally i've been doing these more as
a lat dominant row where i'm thinking
about pulling my elbows primarily
down while keeping them tucked into my
sides now you might have to drop the
weight back a bit but you'll feel a
crazy lat contraction doing them this
way i also like to lean a bit forward
during the eccentric to get a bit more
of a stretch on the lats but you don't
need to lean forward
i know a lot of people prefer to stay
more upright and that'll work fine as
well
it just might be a bit harder to get
that maximum stretch on the lats
and then if you did want to get the mid
traps a bit more involved you'd simply
have to adjust the queuing to think
about driving your elbows back
and squeezing your shoulder blades
together at the top okay up next we're
doing three sets of 12 on the lying leg
curl
and other than calves this is actually
going to be our only leg exercise for
this workout
so no direct quad or glute work this day
they've already got
plenty of volume from the other four
full body days now you could swap the
leg curls for glute ham raises if you
wanted to squeeze in a bit more glute
volume
but because we hit deadlifts just
yesterday on day four you will want to
be cautious and make sure your posterior
chain is feeling recovered
if you do decide to make that swap now
one mistake i see a lot of people make
the leg curl is allowing the pads to pop
up
off the ankles especially toward the top
of the curl if you find this happening
it means you're losing control of the
weight
and using momentum to jack the weight up
rather than consciously squeezing your
hamstrings
to press the pads firmly against your
ankles throughout the range of motion
if this helps you can think about
letting every other muscle in your legs
including your calves go completely
loose
and direct your attention entirely to
the hamstrings if you do this right
you'll gradually apply pressure to the
pads through the positive
rather than just heaving the weight up
and you should feel your hamstrings work
in a way that they probably never have
before
on this exercise all right after that
we're moving on to three sets of 12 reps
on the dumbbell concentration curl
and similar to the leg curl here we're
keeping our elbow joint pinned up
against our leg and focusing on
squeezing our bicep to move the weight
i'm also focusing on using
both primary functions of the bicep here
elbow flexion and supination
so at the bottom i'm holding the
dumbbell with a neutral grip and then
supinating by driving through my pinky
so my palm faces upward at the top
also consciously take more of a loose
grip to make sure my bicep is in fact
doing the work and my forearms aren't
taking over
okay after that we're doing four sets of
15 on the cable crunch
this is one of the few exercises where
you do want to focus on rounding your
lower back as you go through the range
of motion
after all spinal flexion is the primary
function of the rectus abdominis
so you want to keep your shoulders and
arms as locked into place as you
comfortably can
so that the only movement is being
initiated from the six-pack itself
and remember you're not just bending
forward at the hips think of squeezing
your abs together like a sponge or an
accordion
and next we're moving on to hit some
calves so we're doing four sets of 15
reps on the seated calf raise
i like to include both a bent leg option
like these and a straight leg option
like we did back on day three
just for variation throughout the week
and because they likely emphasize
slightly different calf muscles and on
day three we did four sets of eight to
create more of a mechanical tension
driven stimulus
so today we're doing higher reps to
emphasize the metabolic stress pathway
more
and a cue i've been using lately here is
to think about rolling back and forth on
the balls of my feet i find some people
get too fixated on simply just going up
onto their tippy toes
rather than thinking about what the calf
is actually doing which is plantar
flexing the ankle
and as always i'm using a nice pause at
the bottom to help dissipate any elastic
reflex and then finishing each rep with
a strong squeeze at the top
and finally we're going to finish off
this workout and the full week of
training with two all-out sets of
push-ups for as many reps as possible
and i like finishing off the week with a
max effort set like this because you get
to dig deep and really challenge
yourself
and because there's going to be a day or
two of complete rest after this workout
you don't really need to worry quite as
much about having the fatigue interfere
with your next day training performance
but even though these are amrap sets
it's still important to use proper form
with good control
and i standardize my reps by ensuring
that my nose chest and stomach
all touch the floor on each and every
rep your rep count is obviously going to
be lower on the second set due to
fatigue but the key here is to try to
add
one rep to both sets throughout the rest
of the program and before we go i'm
going to put a quick tally of the total
weekly volumes we hit for each body part
up here on the screen
in case you want to adjust any of the
numbers up or down for any weak points
you're trying to give a bit more
focus remember that one of the main
advantages of full body training is
simply being able to spread out your
weekly volume in a way
that maximizes performance and recovery
and that's going to conclude
this full body portion of the science
applied series from here i'm going to
start making some more videos about my
new
power building approach so the new
program alternates between a full body
week and an upper lower week
so it'll be a nice switch up for you
guys and i think you're really going to
enjoy it and as always if you guys are
interested in having all the information
from this series put together into a
complete
10 week training program with all the
sets reps technique cues and progression
schemes all laid out for you you can
pick up my high frequency full body
program over on jeffnipper.com
and i'll put a button to that over here
next to my head thank you guys so much
for watching i really enjoyed making
this series i think this will probably
go down as my personal
favorite split that i've run so far here
on the channel um so don't forget to
leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the
video subscribe if you haven't already
and i'll see you guys all here
