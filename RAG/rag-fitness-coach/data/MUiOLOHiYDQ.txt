snacking the practice of it can
capitalize in not such a good way on
emotional eating bubbles the desire to
eat emotionally is almost never stagnant
like you wake up at 10 A.M geez that's
late pothead you wake up at 8am and
you're like oh man I need to eat food so
I can be happier than I am now I just
feel like if I just had some chocolate
I'd feel better and the same feeling at
lunch same at dinner and same late at
night if the snacks are around it can be
a bad deal just to have a round ideally
you would let it pass and eat your meals
when it's time if you're a snacker
that's not going to happen oftentimes
