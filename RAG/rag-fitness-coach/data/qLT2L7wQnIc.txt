Oh today Robin and I are leaving for the
mr. Olympia contest in Las Vegas
typical egg whites turkey bacon cream of
wheat I've been going with for the last
little while it looks kind of gross now
it needs to be microwaved again that's
whole-grain Cream of Wheat
super filling and pineapple yogurt with
peaches and some strawberries mixed in
kind of our janab anything too delicious
they're not fantastic but I find needs
to be really filling because of the the
nuts and the fiber 100 riyals in this
bad boy
got a salad and roast chicken sandwich
Robin got pretty much the same
morning guys first first day in Vegas
your first stop is gonna be detonators I
love about the states they have and how
are you information like on the menu egg
whites turkey bacon grits food and a
fruit cup
Oh
don't rush don't get it I jump it seem
like that's right you're not
we're gonna go
you
Robin and I are here it's called guilty
power gym or like a hardcore
powerlifting type facility it's really
nice and we're just waiting on Brice and
Berto and I think maybe Liana and a
couple the other belt one athletes to
come here and so today I'm going to be
dead lifting and front squatting and I'm
pretty stoked to use some of this
equipment
