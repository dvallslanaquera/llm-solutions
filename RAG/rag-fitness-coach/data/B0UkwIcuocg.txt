my name is dylan white
i've been lifting weights for roughly
six years and i am 26 years old
i believe i've been coaching dylan since
2017
last year my master's degree he was uh
he wanted me to peek him and then ever
since i peaked him
he like kind of decided to find the
process learned a whole bunch and he was
also an exercise fizz so he decided to
uh
hire somebody who had some degrees and
what he had degrees in
i mean really the peak week for a
natural bodybuilder is super simple
you don't have extra variables so when
people say you know
guys who are enhanced make it easy on
themselves actually peaking is way
harder
peeking for naturals is super easy
dieting for naturals is super hard
dieting for enhance is super easy so
it's kind of a flip-flop little thing
so i died for almost 16 weeks
before i started show prep so i dived
down
for 16 weeks did a maintenance for
roughly four weeks
and then we started the show show prep
itself
and that's been 10 weeks long honestly
it was a lot easier than
previous diets because i cut out all
that artificial sweeteners and stuff
like that a plain jane
just broccoli chicken shrimp
meal the meal that was like my vegetable
and
protein situation and then carbs i stuck
to potatoes oatmeal
and rice cakes to come peeled on stage
as a natural super
straightforward and then after that if
you want to look full and you want to
look
quite dry and like the muscles really
pressing to the surface they always have
to be very carbed up
full glycogen in their muscles and then
you don't want that a
little layer of water into the skin so
with people who are who are natural you
can keep the water sodium
uh and everything high into the show and
if somebody's in shape it's like it's
pretty varied approach if somebody's in
shape they're just in shape
you can the entire peak week eat 300
plus carbs and i believe that's what me
what i did with dylan anyway like monday
we already had a good
275 300 tuesday raised a little
wednesday race to a little bit more than
thursday friday we went to like 500 600
and just slowly filled out and slightly
dropped water toward the varian just so
we weren't
consuming in excess of three gallons
which is what he was consuming at the
beginning of peak week or two
two and a half gallons at the beginning
of peak week sometimes they'll go to
three gallons or so depending on how
much sodium they can tolerate so
i'd say the only hard part for me would
be depletion
that's when you're pushing water or
sodium and then carbs are real low
that five day period is probably the
hardest part of prep
i generally start off really low with
the cardio for most clients
so with dylan we i think we exceeded
four or five days
and that was toward the very end and it
wasn't until the last two weeks maybe
just to speed the process up a tad um
just because he was coming into
an npc show as a natural pro bodybuilder
we wanted to bring that that really
natty conditioning to the stage and make
sure he could hang with the big boys
because he was going to be
i believe outsized by a good 20 pounds
in the weight class that he's in
or the height class so we had to bring
the conditioning um
cardio might have went up to 50 minutes
a day the last week
or five days a week for the last week
but before that it was only like four
days a week at 45 minutes or
roughly around there so the biggest
difference is between
coaching somebody who is who's truly a
natural competitor lifetime natural
and somebody who is on anabolics
currently in their in their contest prep
i would say training volume is obviously
a little different
and oftentimes guys are adding in form
and if i work with the guy
and he is doing such a thing you might
actually see an increase in the volume
tolerance compared to
their massing because the calories don't
get cut very much
you go from massing calories to
maintenance calories
and then all of a sudden your
maintenance calories are now you're
cutting calories when you're enhanced
because
you just added in more stuff so a lot of
guys will do that kind of stuff um
if they're just starting off with
similar amounts of stuff
that the special sports ups that they
were massing with then you can go into
like you know the true maintenance you
know the true deficit
you can slowly work your way down to
that but you also have to supply that
anabolic drive
so you don't actually cut your calories
as low as a natural guy might
um depending on the natural client you
know with
adjusting thermogenesis and how deep
getting deep into prep
you might have to cut calories pretty
low sometimes i've had natural guys had
to go
you know 200 carbs or so i've had
natural guys uh
like marvin who i didn't have to take
below
375 carb or something and he's 100
pounds on stage so it really just
depends on how well the mass went how
long you maintained before you dyed it
down
and how well their their adjusting
thermogenesis kind of is if it's super
adaptive if their metabolism is not
super adaptive
and then with farm you know still
getting into this so it's
it's very interesting to see the the
pharmacological side of things because
a lot of a lot of clients they just get
leaner you know like i said they add
stuff and they just get leaned on the
same amount of calories they were eating
before and it's like
what is going on so uh diet
is the biggest different difference in
variable i would say because you're
still working
with training volume through mev to mrv
and even though they're going in there
on a lot of anabolics
you're still gonna have to do a little
bit more volume when you're dieting down
versus massing if you want to maintain
your tissue
and you're still more than likely not
going to recover from massing volumes
if you're dieting down so and keeping
keeping that that's very important
probably for people who are enhanced who
are listening to this because
you're going to get on extra shit and
you're going to feel like i can just do
more volume
i would look back at your data so you
did your matching phases
and then sort of maybe try to inch up
near that you're going to feel like you
might be able to do more but
you you're probably going to injure
yourself if you do that for sustained
periods of time so it's not a good idea
so dylan actually just won these npc
samsung showdown it was uh
today and with that
we plan on that actually qualifies him
for a national level show in the npc
where he will potentially get a pro card
winning in an overall
npc show is is no joke and uh it usually
means that you're going to be a top guy
at a national show
and he just won the overall so i foresee
dylan
doing very well if not getting a pro
card this year as a natural in the npc
he'll for sure be getting one in the
near future um and if he wants to do
more than one national show if we don't
get at the first go
i'm all for it if he's all for it and if
he wants to keep dieting and and
going through it hell yeah and uh after
that we see what no one wants for the
future really
just build more muscle tissue and see
what we do next
