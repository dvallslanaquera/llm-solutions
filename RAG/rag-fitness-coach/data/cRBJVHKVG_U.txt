hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
let's talk about the myth of linear
progress in hypertrophy
and strength training so when we
train for and especially program and
especially expect results
in strength hypertrophy training there
is a real big assumption of linearity
which means we just kind of think
that linear things should happen because
we sort of think linearly for example
a lot of times people write a program or
modify it by saying okay i'm going to
add five pounds to bar each week
okay five pounds each week each week
each week is a linear
addition right adding one rep
to each session each week adding one set
to each session each week
gaining 15 pounds on my bench uh last
three months
and then this three months i'm also
going to gain another 15 pounds we plan
like this we expect like this
and that tends to sort of in our world
view
about lifting lead us to think like okay
linearity is
what happens and if it's not linear
what's happening
then something's off something's wrong
something needs fixing okay
the thing is the reality is that
sometimes progress
is linear but that's actually the
exception and not the rule
so there are a few reasons why it's the
exception not the rule a few reasons why
a linearity really is the rule for
example
the first one is the concept of
acceleration
and momentum okay in the beginning of
any program
and for beginners to a program or
training generally
progress is not linear it's actually
exponential it accelerates
the more you keep going why this happens
in a couple of ways
first of all learning a new lift
can rapidly escalate progress just
because of technique
the first time you ever squat you're
weak shit the second time you figure
some stuff out the third time your
technique starts to click and you go
boom boom boom and you're just adding
poundages like crazy
right so technique is a huge thing that
happens rapidly
and thus causes sometimes for a short
time exponential progress
okay another exponential process
is the repeated about effect which is
basically how much
delayed onset soreness you get the first
time you train pretty hard you get
wild amount of delayed onset soreness
like a week and a half's worth the
second time with
pretty similar poundages and volumes
you might get less than half of that
amount of soreness
the third time you train in that exact
same way maybe even with a little more
progression
you might get almost no soreness or no
soreness at all
thus the amount of sets for example that
you add from week one to week two may be
like zero
from week two to week three you might
add one set to everything
from week three to week four especially
in new exercises and arrangements you
might add two sets to everything
just like that exponential progress
because the repeated bout effect
functions on a negative exponent right
it falls off like this
so you can train much much more because
you're no longer sort of
super impeded by this crazy soreness not
a linear way but in an exponential way
right adding all those things together
and adding up multiple adaptations at
the same time
can also get you really rapid gains
at the start in an exponential way
basically this is going to be described
as training momentum okay you're adding
size
early in your training and you're adding
work capacity for the size you have your
muscles have more endurance
and your recovery abilities is expanding
at the same
time because those are similar
adaptations inside the muscle itself
and your technique is going up and i
didn't put this down on the slide but
your nervous system's ability to
generate high levels of force
closer and closer to your maximum
ability to output by the muscle is also
increasing so early in the adaptive
process all of these things
tend to work on pretty similar time
courses which is to say they all add up
at the same time
so it's not that just technique by
itself skyrockets you it's that you're
gaining size
and the ability to output tons of neural
uh
basically impetus to the muscles to
contract and
at the same time you're getting a work
capacity boost and recovery ability
boost all this happens it goes
zoop and it just shoots you right to the
moon and you're like oh my god
i put a hundred pounds on my squat in
two months
okay that does and can happen absolutely
so if you think you're due for linear
progress when you start
or if you're a coach and a trainer like
many of you are and you have new clients
or clients new to your style of training
if you expect them to make impressive
linear progress you may be really
unimpressed for the first week or two
pretty impressed in the second week or
two or week or three
and then weeks four five six you may be
like oh my god they're gonna be the
strongest human being on the planet
right now that doesn't last as many you
well know
okay after the initial surge occurs
okay progress begins to slow down
from that initial surge and then
eventually after some time
depending on how long we're talking
about depending on the circumstance
it begins to approach an asymptote which
is basically
like a maximum line of ability and your
gains are
getting ever closer to it and maybe
never actually touching that maximum
line right
but they approach it slower and slower
and slower and slower each time it's
almost like
an invisible ceiling effect right that
absolutely does happen
how do we know this all the evidence in
the world
strength and size gains slow down as you
go from beginner to immediate advanced
i i was gonna say this later but i have
to say this now huge take-home point
if you look at your beginner gains and
you're like man
i'm doing something wrong lately i'm not
getting gains like i did in high school
that's impossible you would have to do
heaven and earth
crazy shit or take all the drugs in the
world to get high school style gains
those gains are left in high school what
you can do is do your best possible job
as an intermediary as advanced but
you're never going to get those gains
back ever again okay
that rate of gains is nuts unless you
quit training and restart why the hell
would you do that
right so because gains become tougher
and tougher to get you can do something
about it but it requires some serious
effort
more effort more diligence right you
have to do more advanced techniques to
keep
any level of progress happening or as
fast as progress as possible
you have to keep uh frequency modulation
and you have to maybe alter the
frequencies increase the frequency
decrease it sometimes
your relative effort has to be a super
concern you used to just
sort of do five by five and you grow
super well now you have to push closer
to failure to grow super well
overreaching becomes a thing you maybe
do functional overreaching
do a specialization phase for one muscle
for a month to really take it beyond its
limits
back away it grows a ton of new muscle
and you go and do that to another muscle
so on and so forth so it's not just
train normally and get great gains you
have to start training more and more in
advanced fashion to continue to see
gains even approach a linear
sort of model and not get real
asymptotic really really quick
right taking these two things together
the beginning exponential curve
and some linearity towards the end of
that and then the ending
asymptotic curve the combined curve
actually has a term in mathematics it's
called an s
curve okay look bucket looks like an s
holy shit right but s curves if you look
at them
describe almost every single biological
process that occurs in your body that is
trainable
right almost everything learning a
language s-curve
ask her for almost everything including
everything you're going to see in the
gym
right that's how it works so here's the
thing
expect it and when you get on the
asymptotic side of course do your best
but don't be like man why aren't my
gains exponential anymore because that's
just not how it works
right now here's another complexity
that takes us away from the linearity
paradigm
sometimes you have to retreat to
progress okay
especially for more experienced folks
sometimes you got to take one step back
to get any gains at all sometimes to get
better gains for example
sometimes you can get sort of one unit
of gains by just taking a step forward
and in one month you gain a unit of one
other times
you can take one step back in that same
month
and then the next month you gain three
steps forward
because you took that step back that's a
net gain
that's higher over that time than you
would just taking steps four
okay or you know you take one step back
four
four that's a gain of three whereas two
months you just take one and one that's
a gain of two
so over two months you did three versus
two that's better but
the way it got better is you took a step
back first which is fucking baffling
right and is almost nothing anyone would
ever guess would be a good idea
and we have to resist our temptations to
always push for linear progress forward
and forward and forward
and never realize that sometimes taking
a step back is the only thing
that's going to allow us progress
forward or is the thing that's going to
let us progress forward faster
what the hell am i even talking about
here are some examples deloading
because if you continue to add volume
intensity after a while you'll get real
asymptotic and then you'll actually fall
off into negatives
by deloading i mean look you're barely
training someone can be like you're
hardcore right look absolutely
like what are you training this week
you're like barely anything at all i'm
deloading bro you're like
isn't that like getting you not any
better like no not for the time but it's
priming me to get better later because
it's dropping a shitload of fatigue and
conserving my gains aha
okay so d-loading is exactly a perfect
example of this
low volume phases backing away from high
volume letting your body desensitize and
then blasting high volume later
fat loss diets to potentiate muscle gain
you might be gaining so much fat that
your pee ratio your partitioning ratio
basically is crap and any amount of
tissue you gain a ton of it is fat and
not as much
as muscle you get a little bit leaner
get a little healthier get a little bit
of more nutrient and insulin sensitivity
go from like you know 18 down to like 12
percent body fat and all of a sudden
going back up from 12 percent you gain
more muscle than before but remember the
fat loss phase itself
doesn't gain you any muscle so someone
could say like you're in a muscle gain
right like yeah like how many calories
you eat
per day you're like 2 500 they're like
what aren't you supposed to eat in like
4 000 you're like yeah it's not my game
phase i'm doing a fat loss phase and
they're like what the hell you losing
fat for bro i thought you were trying to
get
you know trying to get jacked and it's
like yeah i am but i'm too fat to get
jacked right now at the optimal rate let
me get leaner first that's definitely
one step back three steps forward four
steps forward
sort of thing high volume phases of
strength training
to get stronger the high volume phase
builds work capacity and muscle mass
and later your strength phase actually
retrains that muscle mass to produce
more force
but during the time especially if you're
an advanced athlete during the high
volume phase which usually has more sets
and more reps
you actually get weaker in your 1rms
right if you test your squat
at 700 then you do three months of high
volume squatting like with sets of five
to ten reps or
leg press and all this other stuff you
test your 100 max after that it's going
to be like
670. fuck i lost 30 pounds in my squat
but then
you do a strength phase and for three
months you do strength training
and then you retest your max and now
it's like 7 20. and if you had never
done that in the same time frame maybe
you would have gotten from 7 to 705 or
710 so it did pay off but you had to go
back
to come forward right absolutely the
case right
um here's another one that's going to
happen super super commonly
you increase poundages during a
mesocycle you go from like
250 pounds to 270 pounds like by
increments of five
on your bench press in one mesocycle
then in the next mesocycle
if you just start at 270 or 275 you're
like basically going to failure right
away
your fatigue skyrockets and then you
have to end the meso two weeks later
because you've overreached that's
fucking stupid
so instead of going from 270 right to
your 250 to 270
now you go 260 and then you go to 275 or
280 at the end of that meso
and because you've backed up you've
given yourself a buffer zone
of like some reps in reserve you can
build momentum get great technique great
stimulus to fatigue ratio not too close
to failure all the time
and then you get great mesocycle and
build from there and this is a huge
thing that concerns everyone all the
time seemingly
it's like okay i end my meso at 270 for
sets of eight i got to start at 275
right for sets of eight at least nope
because you gotta have
a buffer for yourself you don't just
start out at your maximum
you gotta work back into it from a
mid-range value and that's 100 fine
and for anyone beyond a beginner it is
exactly how optimal training happens
okay you don't just add ad ad you add go
down
add go down add go down period right
another one last example is for
technique
renorming your technique to get more out
of it than later when i was
a very young man i was in high school i
was bench pressing at my uh
community jewish community center all
right it's like a ymca for jews and so
there i was
and i was benching and i had like pretty
decent bench genetics and i was benching
of course flat back with shoulders out
shit like that
and because i just didn't fucking know
any better i was a high school kid and
there was actually a power lifting
champion an older gentleman named bill
great guy he like saw me bench and he's
like do you want to learn how to bench
press and i sort of knew who he was and
i was like
okay in the back of my mind i was like
fuck i know how to bench press but then
i was like this man clearly knows a shit
so like in the course of five minutes he
taught me to arch and retract
and my bench went down because it's
fucking weird like you usually just
press as hard as you can now you like
think about your shoulder blades and all
this crap and i'm like uh
right so my bench went down and then
after several weeks i tied my old pr's
and then it was like ah and it went all
crazy because now i had a great platform
with perfect technique or really good
technique to bench with and my gains
went through the roof and had i never
heeded his advice or had i heeded his
advice
wash my bench go down and be like this
guy doesn't fuck know what he's talking
about bro fuck that i used to bench more
with my dumb ass like football style
bench
that would have been stupid because i
never would have been allowing myself to
bench as much as possible
but because a technique even a better
technique
when it is new can fuck you up and throw
you off
because your body's ideally wants to do
optimal biomechanical technique which is
the arch bench
but also it's used to a certain
technique when you give it a new
technique it throws off the neural
circuitry completely you're like oh shit
i'm not coordinated
so your maximum force production is just
not the same but sometimes you've got to
pay that cost
how many of you have switched from
conventional to sumo deadlift or vice
versa it's a
shitty switch but after a few months
you're like holy shit
i'm gaining like wild so glad that i
took one step
back to take one forward if you were
obsessed with linearity you would have
never done that or you tried it be like
it's bullshit it doesn't work
right so tldr
at the end of the day here's the deal
expect your clients and yourself to do
better than linearly
exponential progress early in the
training phases okay
and if you're just new to training or
early in any training phase so for
example
you have leg pressed and squatted for a
long time and then you threw hack squats
into the mix because you move
and your new gym has an excellent hack
squat do not expect linear gains on the
hack squat they will be exponential for
a short time
you'll do like 3 15 on the hack squat
for ten you're like fuck that's awkward
as shit my knees kind of hurt
second session you do you know three
three or four or whatever 315 you go up
to 325 or like
10 pounds that's a lot and it feels like
pretty decent you're like oh my knees
don't hurt it feels pretty decent
3 35 the next week and instead of the
reps and reserve you're expecting was
two
at your sets of 10 or whatever it's like
six you're like um i'm barely not
working at all
week after that you go to 365 you skip
45 and 55 all together
and still match your reps with the same
rr like holy crap well that's because
you're grooving
your technique is changing your muscle
architecture is changing to a small
extent and that
boosts you super super high expect that
don't be super surprised by it right
it's a thing that's just going to happen
training follows the s-curve which means
later
after the exponential growth and the
slight linear pattern training is going
to get tougher and tougher
okay improvements in the process can
bump
up the slope of this and take that
asymptote higher but you got to be
attentive to it
but don't let it shock you don't let it
surprise you don't be like you know i'm
doing something wrong
because i'm reaching an asymptote you
could be doing everything right and
you'll still reach the asymptote but you
could reach a higher one
right so still do your best but
understand
that you're not like messing up
something completely insane
if you used to gain 25 pounds on your
squat every year
and now you're only gaining 15. that
might be great right now try to gain 20
do your best but if you still
gain 15 for even another year maybe that
year was your
supposed to be by old methods gaining
10. because you gained 15 you're doing
better than you expected
which is a great thing it's all about
the reality of his expectations
next point second to last point
in the advanced it's not even just about
riding that s curve and trying to get as
high as possible it's about sometimes
jumping off the curve and going back
and then rewriting it again to get a
little bit higher be prepared to take
some steps back to take some steps
forward
it's not all just forward forward
forward as a beginner sure fuck it for
uh
you know freight train but as an
intermediate
you know you could probably consider
some steps back maybe a little deloading
something like that
as you're an advanced individual taking
steps back is a huge part of the game
okay there's not a single ifbb pro
bodybuilder that grows muscle linearly
if you see them a few months after their
biggest show of the year they look
pretty small and you're like what the
hell happened
well you lost all your muscle don't
worry they'll gain it back and then some
when they take a planned break in order
to do that
right so here's the thing final note do
your best to progress
using all the technologies and
strategies that you can right
don't get caught up in thinking
something is wrong if your progress is
not linear
because you're not expecting linearity
expect progress
do your best to get it expect the
s-shaped curve understand it when you
experience it
perfectly fine try to do your best in
any scenario
no matter what folks thanks for tuning
in see you next time
