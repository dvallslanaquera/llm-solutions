is that a cupping scar guys for the
record cupping has neither evidence in
support of it nor any physiological
rationale that real scientists can think
of that would make it effective the
probability that cupping does anything
that is worth your time is very low
there is that chance but it's very low I
wouldn't waste my time with cupping I
would file cupping under fad that sucks
because I meet with someone a few times
a month and um they tie me up and do all
kinds of things to me and I come out
with scars mostly emotional scars but
definitely physical ones as well we used
to do a lot of cupping because we
thought it also like made my muscles
heal up but yeah now we just go straight
to the RP hypertrophy app well you guys
know
