yo
what's up youtube check this out
leg workout time
just me
solo
leg workout
type that into x and x x anyway
why do i always do this in the intro it
always goes downhill
here's the thing i'll be training legs
but a bit different than normal less uh
video production scott the videographer
is a lazy piece of shit so mostly just
training vlog style
and
it's a leg workout we'll have other
workouts as well coming up however
we are going to be doing the whole
youtube page subscription shit don't
worry we'll still have all our normal
awesome videos four or five times a week
on the channel
but these kinds of videos long form
where i do the whole workout we
basically show like damn near all the
sets and reps you get to hear me gagging
and breathing and i'll talk about a
bunch of wisdom shit and about the
rationalization for why i put my feet
where i put my feet and why arch like i
arch blah blah all that stuff all the
in-depth stuff
we're gonna be doing that on the paid
channel so if you're interested in this
kind of video you really love it
go upstairs ask your mom to buy you a
subscription to the rp youtube if she
says no remember you can always do the
following
but
mom
if you do that enough times mom will buy
it and then we'll be friends for money
so anyway
give that some thought
what am i thinking about right now
the workout
lying leg curls
middle finger backwards
leg press and then
camber bar squats
the love of my life i would kiss the bar
but bacterially that's probably not a
good idea anyway
let's get to it what is the most
important exercise
for the human body
that you could do
not just
for physical development
but for emotional development
you know like
that like
greek
like
respect of the body plus mind type shit
and like the japanese shit like
uh
what is that shit like
stone and steel or whatever
anyway
the leg curls is the answer
leg curls are an exercise that
it doesn't just strengthen your body
well a specific small part of your body
strengthens your soul
yeah
yeah
yeah in any case that's what i try to
tell myself because i have like four
sets of these fucking shits starting
with leg curls dr mike why are you
starting to leg curls why is that an
isolation movement
the real reason is if i do leg curls and
i take a five minute break after
when i do leg presses and squats later
my hamstrings really don't get involved
much
and leg curls are just not very
systemically fatiguing
like the hamstrings are a large muscle
but not like large like the quads leg
curls do not require
what's that called axial loading at all
right they actually stretch your spine
which is cool
so
you can get them out of the way get a
really great stimulus and then move on
to the next
previously i had been really really
prioritizing quads
and i was getting really good like star
hamstring simulation for my other day
which was good mornings
in the mesocycle before this and so i
did leg curls last and i gotta say i did
like five sets of them towards the end
and didn't get super sore because i was
so tired from doing a crapload of hack
squats and a crapload of lunges and all
that other stuff but today we start with
lead curls so feel free to do that in
your own programming and uh yeah warming
up i generally my warm-ups for most of
my lifts are a set of 12 very light a
set of eight pretty light a set of four
at
just below at or just above the actual
weight i'll be using that day and then i
go into working sets so i already did
one set of 12
at i think 80 pounds and now at like 130
i'll do a set of eight
and just to put that in perspective 130
fresh warmed up on this machine i could
do for
probably 25 reps
to failure so uh eight is still very
very easy but like it's like a
meaningful weight that gets shit going
if you have to ask
warming up slower is better than warming
up faster
warming up slower might take five more
minutes for your whole workout but it
can reduce the chance of injury
significantly and it can potentiate your
performance significantly and
for bodybuilding warming up really well
tends to increase your mind muscle
connection substantially so that's a
huge thing the last thing you want to do
is not warm up do a whole set of
hamstring curls and someone's like hey
how'd your hands feel and you're like i
don't really know what i felt and then
that second set you're like ah now i
feel something well if you want well
your first set is high quality just like
your second
it was fucking light holy balls
next warm up
try 180.
most of it on this machine was 150
however
that was after a whole workout of quads
so
we'll see we'll warm up with 180 if it
feels good i'll do it
the goal here will be like about 15 reps
on the first set and then second third
etcetera sets we'll do my reps which
means i do as many as i can a few reps
shy of failure and then let's say i get
to 13 i rest for a bit do two more and
then get off
15 total for all the sets after
that was easy
easy four
that'll be more except
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
so hard
[Music]
oh
those are my reps i got
15 straight on the first set and then i
now
second set was 10
3 and 2 15 total
two my rep
rest breaks
for three mini my rep sets total
um
some people have been asking and saying
like hey
no doctor mike
you do my reps
a little bit better
better jesus house freudian slip
you do my reps a little differently than
berge fagrelli
who like invented them and coined the
term
yeah i do them differently
but
so if
you think about it sort of
intellectually
the big category
is rest pause
and a fraction of that
is mile reps and another fractions other
ways of doing rest pause
the thing is the way we use them most
the time at rp is
a high rep higher rep set
with several seconds break followed by
many sets
there are different ways to do rest
pause like
some people do rest pause where they do
a set of three
rest
10 seconds a set of three rest a set of
three and then they're done
so
ours is much more like
berger's my rep concept
and because
i learned the concept from him because
he's a great guy
um i feel like i'm probably going to
continue to call it maya reps
so that he gets the proper recognition
and honor that he deserves
and because if you read about my reps
from him and you look at how we do them
it doesn't take a whole lot of
inventiveness to be like oh okay it's
very very similar it's just variation on
a theme i feel like
calling what we do my reps
is
much more accurate than
calling them
rest pause sets or rather the accuracy
is the same the specificity is closer if
we call them maya reps even though it's
not perfect
and then another question i get really
commonly is
that this whole thing where you do one
straight set rest normal time
and then you do my rep sets to match the
total reps that straight set
no that's not how berger does it better
usually picks an exercise i think and
just does
one
my rep set or three to five pauses
and that's it calls that exercise we do
multiple approaches why
uh it's just an effective tool which
gives you objective numbers to hit and
know that
you're scaling volume in a rational
progressive manner and if you need
another set
you can add it and if you don't you
don't because there's no guarantee that
one mile rep set
like you know set up 25 3 4 and then
you're you're done or whatever five four
three there's no guarantee that provides
adequate stimulus so the next question
is okay if you're still doing my reps
but you're not sufficiently stimulated
what do you do next
uh well you know straight set starts
gives you a really good basis to figure
out okay this is a good weight for me
and then you do my rep sets as many of
them as you need with normal rest breaks
in between in order to fill in the
volume that you need because
a lot of training comes down to this you
pick an effective modality
straight sets my reps drop sets down
sets etc and you do as much of it as it
takes
to fill in the requisite volume
that your muscle group has to have
there's no guarantee that one approach
added does enough
so sometimes you have to do multiple
that's it three sets
of leg curls
now it's like press time
why three sets
it's my best estimate
that's what what's close to my minimum
effective volume
i sure hope this doesn't break um
all right
we've done that
uh
could it be too low maybe
what's the problem of it being too low
not a huge problem just a little less
stimulus than i wanted
if it's too high a volume
what ends up happening is i get
overlapping soreness into my next
session
which i definitely don't want from a
stimulus for that session
perspective
excessive damage causing growth problems
and also an injury risk increase
training sore
so if it's your first week of a mezzo
which this is for me
forgot to say that um
err on the side of
uh your best estimate
but if you're not sure here on the side
of a little bit less volume you can
always do more next week
if you air on the side of too much
volume
you have to make adjustments to the
thing you fucked up later on
like press time
but dr mike you're doing leg press
yeah
a lot of times on machines quad machines
hacks what leg press i like to do
bodyweight squats first tomorrow because
they're easy
i do like 15 reps slow with a pause
and then i go to like
a decent weight right away on my presser
hack
because like putting a plate on a leg
presser hack a lot of times
and doing like a set of 12 or whatever
it actually doesn't feel like the
exercise itself
it's like insufficiently difficult
to wear the
mind muscle connection and seemingly
even the movement patterns just seem off
and it's like it's preparing me for a
different exercise
so
it's also like
i have to fucks with plates less saves
me time energy annoyance let's do a set
of bodyweight squats instead of 15
and then the next thing i do in live
press is like a little heavier than i
would normally start from normal and it
all seems to work out well
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
oh last potentiation set
this will be a good week for me to start
5.85
not bad
all right set one
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
ah
[Music]
uh
[Music]
15 reps
10
rest three rest two
sets the uh
minimum standard
for the rest of the mezzo on set one so
from here i do another
probably two or three sets
and
next week
first cell will be probably 15 reps
with 5.95
week after 605
etc
this is what uh
week one looks like
a lot of folks a lot of you guys have
been asking you know
because a lot of our training videos the
high production ones
they're like peak week
so everything's
very close to failure
and then
a lot of folks have been asking hold on
what does week one look like
here you go
notice i got all the reps no problem
but
the term easy is not the most accurate
term to describe
which has happened
but very manageable and
i put it this way
rar aside which is the best way to
catalog what you're doing
the concept with week one is to
challenge yourself
and give yourself some obvious room
above like
i can do more
not a ton of room just a little bit
and then next week you do more or more
until you can't do more
and then the mezzo's over
[Applause]
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
oh 13.
it'll be 11 on the next
common question is
[Laughter]
does me dropping it's like i'm like
pressing hacks i typically could drop my
reps by like two
uh
does that accurately reflect a true rr
so was 15 3 rir okay let's say yes
his 13.
really 3r again
and with 11 really b3 rr again
is there guarantee that the two rep drop
worked no
on average it does though
and are gauging in the set of so hard
that i typically just
do that two drop
sometimes in the later sets
except three four five
i'll just drop by one
because the initial fatigue
is
more substantial than later set fatigue
you guys might have noticed that like
you just said at 15
next set is ten
next is eight
then it's seven seven six something like
that
so for me a lot of times
having learned my body and its responses
over the years
i'll default to a set pattern and auto
regulate a little bit from there
rather than treating rar estimates
as like
a wobbly footed
new newborn deer every time like
trying to really guess raw
on every set of week one the rar
yes there's a place for that especially
as a beginner intermediate
more advanced
i kind of know roughly the zone
then as i get to let's say 12 reps
i think at rep 11.
all right is 12 really where i'm
stopping should i stop now
why should i go for 13 14 and then it's
just
one quick split decision for me to make
as opposed to approaching
past 10 and thinking
is this three rar no due rep
is this three rar no do a rep there's a
lot of cognitive overhead and
you would think okay
jesus is retelling like
how hard is it to think about rar it's
not
but there's other shit you should be
thinking about
um technique
uh
my muscle connection
all that stuff
and i'd rather be thinking about that
and have the rar thing be a really
relatively simple
algorithm rather than you know put a lot
of cognitive
balance into that
and on that note
clear
let's go throw up
throwing up's not that bad
it's the right before
slash between throbs throw-ups
you don't know if it's happening
you just want to feel better
[Music]
[Music]
12.
so
based on what i bought earlier
right as i got to like
nine reps i was like yeah 12 isn't going
to be a problem 11 is going to be too
easy
easy decision i can focus on technique
dr mike
you ask
what are you drinking during your
workouts
usually
just water
with like
one of those calorie free squirts
this one's like
strawberry cranberry or some shit
shit i'll be throwing up anyway you know
i was at walmart with my wife and i like
this bottle it's like a good size and
grip and
i like the cap and i need a bottle to
drink
from during workouts
so i got it and it came home and i
poured the stupid alkaline where the
fuck is in here directly into the drain
put tap water in it and we're good to go
tap water
that's how dad did it that's how grandpa
did it
[Music]
god squatting with this bar for me
is like playing beautiful music on a
violin oh
potentiation set
last warm-up here
by the way you guys didn't miss anything
i only
generally do like two sets
to warm up for exercises
that are not first for that muscle group
so my leg presses already warm up the
quads
hips knees etc
and then this
just two two more upsets should be good
enough so
i'm gonna stay here
throw on the belt
do some paw squats
um two sets here because it's five total
quad sets with some reps that's usually
how i start
again erring on the side a little less
reps i'm not sure
five to ten these are going to be solid
pauses
so work from that
almost passed out
ah
[Music]
uh
oh
holy shit
pretty easy technique felt good
everything's good
eight reps
solid pauses
next set will be like six
a quality
uh
that's six
fucking
well
that's all folks that's the workout
