this is going to be
the uh the bar to the thingy
then you go like this hey folks
today we're training triceps this is the
pm session
a little bit of chest of front delts of
course and
one exercise for back this type of
vertical pulling exercise
this morning we did a horizontal pulling
exercise for back right after we did
chest
first exercise for today i don't want to
say we want to pre-exhaust
triceps but it's helpful that the
triceps are the limiting factor a ton on
the first exercise skull crushers
later when we do dips and other presses
the triceps will be the limiting factor
and that's going to be helpful because
our pecs are already toast
skull crushers sets of oh 10 to 20 reps
some of us like to go a little lighter
some heavier and that way we get a
really great stimulus
and then we move on to dips afterwards
to really put the triceps
all the way to the limits
come on come on
no we're not using chalk in the gym
[Music]
uh
ah
hey guys dips are up next probably about
four sets here
usually i like to do them paused with a
good pause at the bottom keeps a little
bit safer
lets me have a better mind muscle
connection with my triceps not a
requisite
jared may pause them charlie may not no
big deal full range of motion
sets of oh 10 to 20 at first
and then the reps whittle down as we get
tired probably about four sets
[Music]
ready
[Music]
mommy and daddy are exciting again
what are they fighting about i don't
know but
i think i'm gonna go live with my
[Music]
grandparents
[Music]
all right folks we've done skull
crushers we've done dips
last pushing movement for today machine
press with a closer grip for more tricep
emphasis
still hits the pack still hits the front
delts great finishing move
although i hate that term and it
doesn't mean anything let's give this a
[Music]
look
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hey folks i'm pretty tired i don't even
know what the hell's going on anymore
wait pull downs so
earlier this morning we did roads at the
end of our workout there's nothing
magical about that we just need more
back volume
and we essentially are training back
monday
we're training back wednesday and we're
training back again
on saturday so on monday
we have two push sessions already we're
not going to do a third session of back
that would be overkill so we're doing
rows at the end of the am workout
and a vertical pull today pull downs at
the end of the pm workout
four sets this is peak week which is as
good as it gets
maybe we'll do more usually it's about
four sets at this point of each
that's eight total back sets for today
for monday hey that ain't bad
combine that with eight to twelve sets
on wednesday and another eight to twelve
on saturday that's a lot of volume
spread over the week high quality work
so yeah it's kind of weird
you have a ball or chest and tricep pump
then you have to do a little bit of back
work
it kind of sucks it throws you off maybe
but this is the best way to sandwich
the most high quality volume that we
found in this particular arrangement
in the week it works
how much more crisp my technique is than
theirs
all right folks that was it the whole
session skull crushers
dips close grip machine presses and then
pull downs
so earlier today well last week's video
however we post this
we did chest emphasis push and then we
did some rowing
later today we did triceps emphasis push
finish those off
some vertical pulling tomorrow we have
an interesting day
you probably see this next week
depending on how we post it is legs
the first leg workout of the week am and
then pm if we're still alive
charlie will probably be dead we're
gonna do shoulders biceps and forearms
strange but if you see the template
we've laid out for how this looks it
kind of makes sense
see you tomorrow and maybe never after
because we're gonna die during bugs
charlie do the outro i'm tired
