choose a weight for each exercise which
barely allows the performance of eight
repetitions in perfectly strict form
this is very good advice as with much in
hit it's too specific challenging
yourself with anything between five and
30 repetitions seems to have roughly
equivalent effect on muscular
hypertrophy muscle growth eight is
definitely between five and 30 but
there's a lot of options there and you
can feel free to be much more creative
than just eight reps
