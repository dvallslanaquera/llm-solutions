she is a bikini competitor
she is the owner of black mamba barbell
in royal oak michigan if you are in the
area you should check it out decked out
to the nines of arsenal strength
equipment oh only the best hey our own
gyms are pretty close together what are
you trying to do move into my territory
you don't even have to answer
this is sam charlton and she is here for
deltoid
destruction yes which i think leads to
growth later but that's not my problem
we put the hammer down and then you go
home and hopefully recover
how are you feeling i'm pumped oh but
not yet
but soon let's get it started
[Music]
three exercises today technically we
gave the job in two but sam drove all
this way we're gonna show her a little
variety
three sets of each for nine sets total
for side and rear delts the front delt
general generally gets so much volume
from pressing it's not a priority boy oh
boy sam's gonna have a hard time lifting
your hands above her head after this
exercise number one is free motion
laterals now you could
do them
like so
and i have seen this done at many gyms
where you do this
okay the problem is that misses out on a
huge part of the range of motion because
the tension kicks off right here and it
misses out on the stretch under tension
so if we cross
these implements what are they saying
ghostbusters never cross streams
they lied also how many of the
ghostbusters were jacked like this
nobody so check this out
extended elbows
cross as much as you can i have a lip x
so i can't go any further
and then with straight arms we are going
to reach up like a very wide version of
the letter y
pause
slow and controlled
none of this
straight
up
slow no breaks as soon as you hit the
bottom
up and hold and down
we're gonna do my rep matches which
means whatever she gets on the first set
she has to match with many rust breaks
for the other two sets
let's get into it
one straight set
let's get all the way to muscular
failure
good technique always
six all the way down
seven
incredible
go
eight
we need four more
nine
ten
good enough rack
good stuff good stuff
so here's the deal without ever putting
them down so you can take a rest break
here and get it out ten okay so try to
get five to six correct
one
two
three
four
[Music]
five one more one more before you rest
straight arms
go

we'll do one more set just like that
okay and then without much rest i'll put
it a little lighter and do a burnout
session all right sweet sound good yeah

[Music]
all right what kind of person would i be
if someone visited rp gym do a workout
and did shoulders and didn't do suprom
lateral so i'd probably be an okay
person generally it's irrelevant but
we're doing super round laterals that's
what's coming up next gee three or four
sets and of course my rep match the
brutality continues start out stumbles
hanging
what we want to do is straighten the
elbows
and you're going to reach all the way up
until they are basically straight up
above you and then control now it's
going to be the hardest to control from
here
to here okay
here it's going to be a little easy
break okay so you can come all the way
back down here gently touch the
dumbbells extend it all the way up and
then slow slow slow slow slow slow and
when you come up it's going to be a
temptation to do this yeah resist only
dealt yeah sound good yep
oh my god these are perfect up and back

oh my god
that's insane yeah how i don't know they
gave me a phd in the show yeah it's good
wow
if i don't have at least an inch added
onto my delts after this do you want to
be pissed get a refund
face pulls last exercise tying it all in
together
some folks will need chalk for this some
will need straps i definitely do if i go
heavy because this just isn't enough
some folks can get by without it
tons of different ways to do face pulls
one of the things is in our facebook
instructional it was
uh
the bar was set lower the height was set
lower and people were good to know
your mic like oh shit i didn't know that
it's a face pull no matter what height
you pull from it's the fact that you
have the rope and you pull to the face
that makes it a fucking baseball so you
can pull from lower angles you can pull
from medium you can even pull from high
i would advise against going too high
above your head because that turns more
into a back exercise and a rear delt
exercise than it does on a side delt so
we're doing side belts we do roughly
what i like to call technical term
crotch height and
back away so that there's always slack
elbows go up and back my mobility is dog
shit as you guys probably know you want
to take your hands and put them as far
behind your ears as possible pause at
the top and it's super important the
most tension is right here
don't just go like this when you get up
milk it out
and then when it gets super easy at the
bottom you can even cut that range get
to about a one-third bend and come back
up and that's what we'll be doing lots
of reps
let's do it
oh yeah
oh yeah
three more
good way to hold it
go go go go go
take a break rest for a sec don't go
anywhere
two go
yes one
control
right up
yes slow
rack
stop
those are hard yeah yeah you can you can
relax in that way
so face pulls this applies to a ton of
different exercises but to a different
degree face pulls are one of these
exercises that the mind muscle
connection is so much more important
than how much weight you're lifting
because if you just heave-ho on face
pulls like your whole body gets involved
and then your teeny tiny little side
dogs are ever going to feel it if you
face pull make sure you're always
pulling your elbows back
the tops of your hands back
and convincingly
just like this under total control if
you start doing this shit
you'll be athletic i guess
do them right
[Music]
two
[Music]
good
down rest
two and you're done
hold down
last one make it good up
oh go go go go go hold hold hold hold
hold hold down
[Music]
