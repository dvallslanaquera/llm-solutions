crap I would I would call this probably
the best CL
[Music]
exercise folks Dr Mike here for
Renaissance
periodization this is Ashley owski she
is an ifbb figure professional this is
Dr Crystal gavar she is a certified
board certified sports medicine doctor
and uh that's like a famous boyfriend or
something Jared feather my 100%
biological son and a student who every
year in which he's in school and he
still is one states of course and if you
don't agree with that then one state
it's just a different way of saying it
now this is all the cut to the Chase of
why we're here at a very very important
juncture in history let's talk about
some historical
events the Revolutionary United States
versus
England we had communism versus
capitalism we even had Mathra versus
Godzilla but all those battles can be
sucked down to a tiny little sliver and
the big battle is the one we're doing
today that's right it's what you guess
is big titties versus little titties
what I meant to say was it's a glute
workout what isn't that nice they
actually did they they beef like the
first time you guys know when you have
dogs that like you have the dog and your
friend has a dog and you're like oh my
God Connor's so great right jar like
he's so friendly with everyone and then
you get them
in they legitimately did that earlier to
each other because the big Tiss littleti
just wouldn't add up positive and
negative protons and shit but what we
were like we pulled them apart guys guys
guys listen stay calm how about thought
we take all this fucking rage on a glute
workout hypertrophy glute scientifically
based we get all be out yeah yeah last
thing last thing ready hey you guys want
to see my dick ah you pay for that shin
and only fans let start the fucking
deadlift first exercise in our Mega
glute day is stiffle a deadlift three
sets of 5 to 10 reps nice and heavy with
a slow control Ecentric for the
hamstring and the glute after that we
are going to be moving on to front foot
elevated Smith machine lunges which are
terrible I'll tell you all about them in
a sec and then once those glutes are
cooked and the quads are pretty fuck
close to done we're going to do some
more Smith machine wide stance squatting
which biases the glutes a little bit
more and screws up the quads like crazy
and at the end maybe we'll have a little
fun burnout stuff that the girls don't
know about that so don't tell I
generally don't tell limit shit unless
they need to note you feel me sh your
boy does
it let's go train stiff leg a deadlifts
today okay and we are emphasizing glutes
and hamstrings to do them in the
convention style you want your chest up
the entire time but back knees not super
bent and you don't have to necessarily
touch the ground every time you just go
until you get a real painful stretch in
the back of those hams big chest knees
back Big Stretch down that's
it
as if another big chest big chest big
chest WRA slow slow and come
up as if another
slow
chust chest means up doesn't mean
anything perverted I promise I was like
looked at I'm like and I dropped nice
sof got soft skin I do like I do
appreciate soft skin truly I do I
do good good good back beautiful c
yeah control control control big
chest try to get one more one more one
more keep that bar close too KNE back
bar close come up as if
another
[Music]
chest here you go

good
slow nice and easy couple
more back F back back beautiful
yes Ashley good stuff every rep like
that that was
perfect yeah and then is if another last
descent slow but up there you go he's
back there you
[Music]
go have you ever had someone do these in
like fart when they go down myself I've
done that oh really I've shit myself
really on the way up I've been around
hand down folks stiffle a dead lips are
finished the ladies have Supple
hamstrings I don't know I didn't touch
anyone yet but my parole officer says
it's just a matter of time
again again again anyway front foot
elevated Smith machine lunch is an
exercise I stole from Mr Jared feather
ifb Pro he likes to say he invented it
but I like to say I invented it instead
so I'd like for you guys to start
referring to this as the Dr Mike lunge
the big critical thing on this exercise
that Jared is really big on is totally
correct is to put as much of that weight
in the front leg as possible and have
the back leg even if you just touch on
your tippy toes it's only the control
leg and the emergency leg if you can't
get up from the bottom and you're going
to go down super slow controlled and
especially milk that bottom part cuz
there where a lot of that growth is a
huge stretch under the glute this
exercise you need almost no fucking
weight your boy got glutes my glutes got
glutes and my glutes got glut on fucking
speed dial I do 10 lbs on each side for
sets of 15 I'm fucking cooked so if you
using 225 or some shit you're probably
doing it wrong or DM me cuz I need to
see that ass anyway let's get to the
exercise up on the front leg front leg
there you go shit nice and slow little
less just for stability just for
stability use that front leg come up my
God yes yes
up there you go nice and nice
and on the front
push good how's that glue feel good
stuff good let's get one more let's get
one more down now let's go just for
stability just for stability yes front

stability slower on the way down slow

Ash just for stability yeah go ahead and
then
front last one deep go slow just like
glute big chest big chest GL GL
GL there you go good take a
[Applause]
breather yeah so for this there are a
couple ways you can do a rest between uh
exercises where you're doing one side
and then the other so you can take
sufficient rest on one side and do all
the all the sets if you'd like and then
do it on the other side or just rest
enough to we and do your weak leg first
so weak leg first get the Reps you're
going to get rest a sufficient amount of
time to where your cardiovascular system
is not the limiting factor and then do
the other leg and that's that's one set
so do that multiple
times and then get you a good training
partner like my dad
here five time state champion middle
school and we getting him to high school

here I'm just going to go outside
it's really like I can feel it dude it's
like so we're going to use two you're
going to use two tricks okay we going
use one trick and if that doesn't work
we use the other trick okay we are not
condoning any kind of eating
disorder Yes except the fake there it is

I feel better that's it thank you
awesome of course she just even got the
tears what did you guys do out there
finger
bang Crystal's like what and you want to
literally like like finger bang your
glaus as far up as you can get in there
folks last exercise that's on paper is
going to be the Smith machine squat but
with some tricks since it's glute
focused the ladies are going to stand
really under the weight and not forward
like we usually do we go forward to bias
the quads for that big knee flexion but
what we're going to do here is we're
going to put a back a little bit so that
their goal absolutely is going to be to
go down it's going to be to get knee
flexion but it's mostly going to get hip
extension sorry hip flexion so we want
them to sit back and down obviously
chest still upright back still straight
but can't delived over straight not
vertical still a straight back but
tilted so that they're touching
something back there with their glutes
big glute energy and come up and it's
best done if you're listening to
lizo about six sets here so far oh total
in this exercise and they're fucked
that's true you're going to get six sets
no that's what you've done so far you
guys are this you guys are this fuck I'm
quitting I'm done with watching these
training videos if there's anything you
all take away at home it's what Ashley
said before she started that set we've
done six total sets so far and she said
if we do six more I'm quitting she means
that and she's literally a professional
figure athlete when you train properly
for range of motion you're emphasizing
the slow control Ecentric you're not
doing those workouts you see saw back in
the day on Flex magazine like 30 set
workouts 20 set workouts I mean even
like a 15 set workouts fucking hard you
just start to get to a junk volume range
and if you can if you think you're
actually finishing a session with 15
working sets for legs I can promise you
your Technique is Shifting you're not
using the control Ecentric and the and
the volume is just way too much so take
that that away put it in your pocket if
you ever get a coach that send you
sessions that have like 30 sets in one
session fire them yes I say that very
confidently please and hire
me I've been a coach for a few years and
well I have a few attributes you might
be interested in like uh F
friendliness

all he's got those are his
credentials
