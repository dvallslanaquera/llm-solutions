shouldn't be event overall being super
pedantic should be hintero what we do is
you basically do a stuff like a deadlift
down to the bar notice my tummy's out my
back is nice and tight I've hinged using
my hips not my back my back is straight
my spinal Erectors are strong
I grab the bar and then
rowing as easy as fuck and I can row
hundreds of pounds and all of it is my
back instead of just my spiral Erectors
lats Erectors rhomboids traps everything
with maximum load because they're strong
in a strong position
