hey folks dr mike isrtel renaissance
periodization
back in our series of powerlifting
program design
here we go last time we designed a
strength program this time we're going
to figure out how to run it
quick reminder highly recommended for
you guys to view
the whole rest of the series in the
videos that have been released so far
specifically
how to build a hypertrophy program for
powerlifting
and how to run that hypertrophy program
and of course the last video of how to
build a strength program if you get that
context a lot of this is going to make
a ton more sense you get more out of it
you'll get better programming for
yourself
which is kind of the whole point of
watching these videos anyway unless
you watch these videos for the soothing
sound of my voice
unlikely and my incredible ability to
match my facial expressions to what i'm
saying
again unimpressive so let's get to the
facts because that's why you're here
so first quick review of the program we
built last time
in the strength design video then we're
going to talk about how to set muscle
cycle length
we're going to talk about how to
progress relative effort volume
and then of course how to deload quite
simple a little bit different than for
hypertrophy so it's worth noting
then of course starting the next
strength meso and then
we'll preview the next video which if
you know your polish computerization
might have something to do with peaking
let's get started so here's the sample
program we built last time again
first after i'm done with this little
mini rant about this program feel free
to pause your video
zoom in on the program and take a look
at its architecture it's
just a sample this isn't the way to
design strength programs for
powerlifting
it's just a way to do it if you're
really curious about how the hell we
built this check out the last video
previous one in this series and you'll
figure that out because we go through it
all the way through so here's the
program we built
now we have to figure out how to
progress but first we have to figure out
how long to progress for
right we need to know the meso length
because we need to figure out how fast
to progress if your mesocycle is very
long let's say eight consecutive weeks
of harder and harder training the harder
inclination of how much harder than last
time
i know you're going to post about this
how much harder than last time
it's just a little bit harder because
you got to dope that out for eight
weeks
you can't just like blow it all out in
two weeks and be like oh like i guess
i'm training to failure the rest this
time
on the other hand if you have a maybe
three week accumulation phase of three
weeks of harder and harder and then a
deload
well then you can't just really sort of
willy-nilly make things a little bit
harder each time because you get your
third week you know
i guess it's time to deload next but
we're not even pushing it that hard why
the hell am i dealing right so you have
to know the mezzo length
or you should know it the more you know
it the better you can actually plan your
progressions right
so how do you determine mess length
where there's a couple of basic ways
first if you have a meet a competition
in powerlifting or you just have a time
in a couple months or something where
you want to shoot for prs even if you're
just in the gym
knowing that can help you plan the
mesocycles really really specifically
let's say it's five weeks we're not
going to do two metal cycles of strength
in five weeks that's ridiculous you
would deal it a week two and a half or
something
so then you know you have like probably
four weeks up one week down right
if it's ten weeks and you're probably
not gonna do a ten week
ascending mesocycle ten weeks of nine
weeks of accumulation is a bit much
way too much accumulative fatigue at the
end so maybe you'll do like
four up one down four up one down and
then you're ready so knowing
that context is really important you
don't just want to start training and go
like well
guess i'm ready to peak now you want to
kind of know when things are happening
so you can make logical
progressions and logical decisions about
measure cycle length
generally speaking powerlifting
peaking sorry powerlifting strength
mesocycles can be or should be between
four and six weeks long and that's total
including the deload so that means you
can have three weeks up and one down
three weeks accumulation one deload you
can also have
uh up to five weeks of accumulation one
deload if you're a beginner
you can go longer than this and strength
measures for sure this lecture series is
a little bit more directed at the
intermediate and above
if you're really training for hardcore
strength to be as good of a powerful as
you can be
it's unlikely that you don't need to
deload much longer than six weeks at a
time
if you can make it great there's almost
never a disadvantage from cutting it a
little bit short
having a little bit more breathing room
and just doing better next time okay so
four to six is probably we're looking at
there are exceptions to that general
rule but if you're really questioning
how many mesocycles can i stuff into the
space of eight weeks or six weeks or 10
weeks or 12 weeks
until my peaking phase starts then the
answer is well these are
roughly four to six weeks long so jenga
blocked them in as you see fit
and within that range between four and
six roughly
you can choose via first of all meet
scheduling like if you have
five total weeks like hey you're not
doing two of these things right if you
have ten weeks then maybe you're doing
uh two of them if you have 15 weeks and
you can for sure do three so on and so
forth
next one is your training agent recovery
ability some of the best power lifters
in the world
do a three three to one paradigm three
up
one week down because they can't
physically survive anymore because they
take
such a huge beating from squatting and
dead lifting 800 pounds benching 500
you just don't do that for six weeks
straight it's almost impossible you have
to deload more frequently
on the other hand if you're more of an
immediate more of a beginner-ish kind of
lifter or you just have really excellent
recovery
then there's no reason if you can go
hardcore for five weeks straight before
a deload why the hell wouldn't you it's
awesome momentum
uh absolutely do that but just don't lie
to yourself if you consistently fall
apart at week four
stop planning five week accumulations
it's a bad idea and of course
if nothing else trial and error so some
of you may be coming to this video
not having done a lot of this formal
kind of training design before and
you're like
 what the hell is an accumulation
phase anyway i don't know how long mine
is
just start training and you know
obviously if you're
sort of that beginner your meat's
probably not for a while you have plenty
of time
for a strength meso just keep going
until you're not hitting pr's anymore
and you're super
beat up take a de-load and look at how
long that was you're saying okay
that was seven weeks of accumulation and
one week deload honestly by week number
six i was really messed up and i should
just stop there
so next time i'm going to do five up one
down and then boom you have your trial
and error
just once has given you really great
data on what to do from then on and you
can always modify it later
so now after this we have a mesocycle
length based on all these
now we can use that to progress on
relative effort and here the situation
is really quite simple
almost mesocycles in strength training
for powerlifting you start at roughly
rpe 7
and you end at roughly rpe 10 and then
however many weeks is between them you
interpolate rpe targets week to week to
week
so week one could be rp7
week two rp8 then week three rp9 in week
four
rp it's a 4 week 4 up 1 down
really great standard cycle does it have
to be that no but
whatever way if it's longer or shorter
basically you should be starting a 7
ending at 10
which means you might repeat some rps
you may do fractional rps if you're not
sort of thing
except today's a 7.5 is that really
possible to tell maybe maybe not
that in any case you can repeat like
seven seven eight eight nine nine
etc you can do that whatever it takes
and it doesn't have to be exactly linear
it can do this
but you got to start a star start at
7-ish rp
and you probably should end it around
10-ish rp right it's
really that straightforward now
how do you know how much sort of load to
put on the bar
well generally speaking in hypertrophy
training we can add reps or load
in strength training it's absolutely
critical for you to add load because
that's what you're going to be tested on
it's strength increase that we want i
mean if you're adding reps
you're getting better strength endurance
but at the end of the day if your sets
of five turn into sets of eight
yeah you'll get stronger but you'll get
much stronger and actually what strength
means is lifting more weight
by lifting more weight so it still sets
a five but
more and more weight so you can add
enough weight to each successive workout
to roughly target that rpe that you want
to hit so for example you did
you squatted 250 pounds for sets of five
and week one at rp7
next week you got to do rp8 it's an
educated guess on your part as to how
much weight to do for that maybe it's
260 pounds
you do a first set and you're like nah
that was like rp6 so instead of 260
next literal next set you put 270 on the
bar you hit it you're like oh
that was perfect that was our p8 that's
exactly what i needed
third set let's see have four sets total
that day of squats fourth set 270 again
beautiful rp8 and then the last set
you're like feeling pretty tired you're
like man
that that lasts that i sure as hell i'm
not that's gonna be an rp9
or some if i if i really hit it you
know for five
at 270 maybe i'll go back to 265 or 260.
you hit 260 again
it's again an rp8 perfect taken taking
into account you're done you're all set
and you're out
so so that's how you essentially uh
you know do that process if you mess up
on a given set adjust the next set no
problem
so that every workout to work out to
work out is a little bit of a guessing
game educated one
and every set to set to set is a little
bit of a guessing game for altering
loads no big deal because you're just
trying to do your best right and
the kicker here is because the rpes are
ascending and because you're trying to
get stronger
never let the average load for a session
go down sure you can do 270 some of the
sets on 260 for some of the other ones
just getting tired no big deal
but if you did 270 and 260 for some of
these sets in week one
you had better be doing some like
265 275 for those same sets in week two
and so on and so forth
if you cannot progress and load at all
week to week like it's the same
week four and week five are the same or
week four you hit really big pr's and
week five you actually couldn't do as
much
sets and and rep equated then you
hit your maximum recoverable volume and
you need to deload like asap because
getting weaker is absolutely not part of
the sport
so relatively simple straightforward
stuff there
what about volume progression generally
speaking volume is king for hypertrophy
but strength the king there is load
not a controversial statement and
progression in load is
absolutely critical it's adding 5 pounds
10 pounds here and there to the bar
that's what makes a huge difference
that's what builds all of your strength
so volume progression is a factor but
it's very very secondary
how do we figure out the right volume
progression or just the right average
amount of volume to use well
generally speaking you start at your
minimum effective volume
and you you know enough to get you a
good workout let's say you know anything
about your volume landmarks
you run a normal standard cycle exactly
the meso that you know you were going to
run
five weeks up one down and at week five
you hit rp 10 right easy to do because
rp10 is
easy to hit you just keep going until
you can't go anymore and you have to
rack the bar because you won't get any
more reps
at that point you have to do one of two
things
one is if you feel
like you can do more next week more
weight
at rp10 again and still hit a pr
you can try another week if you have
that flexibility into your metacycle
length if you have a meat coming up you
probably don't
you can try another week and if you
succeed that means in that last week
that you thought was going to be the end
you weren't actually at your maximum
recoverable volume ideally
every strength mesocycle hits rpe 10 in
the last week
and maximum recovery volume at the same
time
that means you did all of the load you
could have and
all of the volume to stimulate as much
adaptation from that load as you could
because if you could have done more
volume while still hitting these big-ass
pr's
why the didn't you right you're
literally just leaving games on the tank
for no good goddamn reason
so option one is just to keep going and
see if you can
option two for more in high-level
intermediates and more advanced folks is
better
it's just an educated guess to inform
your volume for next time
so you get to week five and you gotta
deal it in week six and if you have a
meet coming up soon you got to deal with
week 6 anyway no matter how week 5 went
you hit rp 10 and everything just ask
yourself a super honest question
can i continue to hit pr's with this
much volume
at our p10 another week if the answer is
yes
shut it down deload like normal but next
time you do a strength meso
know that the average amount of volume
you did over the course of this one
needs to be higher you can lift it in a
progressive manner where you start out
with the same minimum effect of volume
but over the course of the next meso you
add one or two sets here and there
so that the average volume goes up
because the end volume is higher totally
fine
or if you'd like a simpler method is
just to raise the volume from the
beginning and just raise it on average
so
the volume can be the same set numbers
can be the same week to week to week
but like they usually you know three and
four sets of stuff now it's like four
and five sets of stuff so you just
needed more volume because it clearly
wasn't enough because you could keep
going further
however a lot of times the answer won't
be i could have kept going further it'll
be like
oh i'm not sure or often it'll be like
dude
what like someone's like okay you just
hit 405
for a set of six huge pr and you did set
five four and three
back off or whatever you're just toast
you're lying on the ground convulsing
and someone's like sweet workout you're
like thanks bro you're like
next week four ten same workout just
five more pounds you're like are you
 crazy i can't do this again
for two weeks i need to deal it right
now
if they made liquid deload i would shoot
that into my veins like a heroin
addict in front of everyone at the gym
that's a poor look for people you know a
future boss might be there you don't
want to do that sort of thing so
if that's you and if there's no
way you can do another week then you
know the volume was perfectly sufficient
and you don't have to raise it within
the foreseeable future
if you're not sure err on the side of
not raising your volume next time
volume chasing is pretty good for
hypertrophy it's not good for strength
next time just add a little bit more
load to the bar than you otherwise would
and you're good to go
so that's the way it works now the more
advanced you become
the less volume is going to rise through
the mesocyclone
and the more you're just going to have a
stable volume and all of the
travel from minimum effective volume to
maximum recoverable because now minimum
effective volume is higher
maximum recoverable is lower lower that
space is going to be so tiny
that you can make it up just with load
additions because technically speaking
if you go from 385 to 405 over the
course of a mess on your squat
that's a volume increase like in the
mathematical sense of ces times reps
times weight
that's more of that stuff and sometimes
you're mev and mrv and also remember
fatigue rises
bringing your mrv down to you at the end
of a meso
if it starts just above and your meds
are already high it can really just be
the same thing the entire time
so if you're advanced you don't have to
think
that in a strength progression i have to
progress in volume you don't
you don't have to progress in volume at
all you only should be progressing in
volume
if you consistently get to the end of
your mesos
hit rp 10 and your first thought is i
hated pr
and your second thought is like i could
probably do more than that if i
just had like a week of recovery and i
just did it next week
if that's your answer you need to do
more stuff some people would say why not
just add more weight to the bar
well it was rp 10 you can't possibly add
more weight
but if you're not tired you can add more
volume just as a thought experiment if
you really push this
imagine doing a workout with just all
singles one set of the squat and then
you go that's your workout
at the end of a four week progression
when you hit a big pr at rp10 could you
do just a little more than that
a week later probably even for the love
of god it was a rap if you can't
recover from one rep and
after a week or half a week of of easier
training or other muscle groups
what the hell are you doing so that is
way under dosing the volume
any volume higher than that would be
better of course but there's definitely
a distinct limit
don't push the volume but if it's too
easy it's too little volume if you feel
like you can keep progressing
raise the volume in the next meso that's
the best approach
all right that's it really now we're up
to the d-load all we do is we raise the
loads a little bit we adjust the volume
as needed and voila we finished with
hopefully a bunch of big pr's under a
belt where the strongest we've ever been
how to deload well it's a little bit
different than hypertrophy
first it's the split this is just an
option for de-learning and it works
really well theoretically
you split the week into two halves first
half second half
first half you take all of your loads
that you did in week one
of the program not the last week so if
you started at 385 and the squad worked
up to 405
you take 80 of 385 your week one load
and you do that for
all the sets that you normally would
have right in week one
and let's say it was three you do three
sets but instead of like
six and six and six reps the devil's
number if you did that in week one
take your week one reps and cut them in
half
so you're doing 80 of 385 whatever that
is let's pretend it's like 340 or some
 like that you do like roughly 340
and you do that for in that case three
sets of three
if the original was three sets of six at
385 or something like that
my math was definitely off because it's
not 340 but in any case we can pretend
80 of that some of you will say oh my
god that's really easy
no it's a d load it's not supposed
to be that hard some of you will say
damn that's still pretty intense it is
because it's designed to conserve your
adaptations but the intensity will come
down a ton when you get the second half
of the week so this applies to all of
your lifts in the first half
when you get to the second half of the
lift or sorry second half of the week
you're gonna take all of your week one
again we go always zoom back to week one
take all the same sets reps and load
take the load and reduce it by
40 or 240 so by 60 percent
so if you were lifting 100 pounds now
you lift 40 pounds i mean it's
ridiculously easy which is good
because this is the hyper recovery phase
of the dealer we're really not supposed
to be stressing anything
and of course the reps are down by half
so if you're doing sets of six
you do sets of three and what you can do
in addition to that is just consolidate
the two or three workouts you have in
the last half of the week
into one big workout because this is so
easy each workout by itself is going to
take you like 15 or 20 minutes
what you can do is if you normally train
like thursday friday and you take
uh saturday and sunday off what you can
do is just completely just not show up
to the gym thursday
take the thursday friday session combine
it at a 40 minute session do it friday
and then get out of some time off super
great for healing super economical on
time as well
here's the deal whatever you end up
doing make sure it hits at least two
points one
it's still letting you practice the
lifts one of the main reasons why
empower lifting a deload is
notably better than taking a whole week
off is because a d-load lets you
physically practice technically practice
the lifts
keeps you crisp and sharp even might
make you a little bit crisper and
sharper because it's lower loads you can
really practice technique
which makes your next week of training
after that training way better because
if you take a whole week off of training
come back kind of a little bit of an
awkward situation
and the other big thing is that deload
has to at the end of it make you feel
more recovered and not less okay if
you're in a
your next program starts monday and it's
saturday of the deload week and people
like dude how you feeling you're like
dude load me up you're doing
d-load wrong what you should be saying
saturday is like man i can't wait to
train
and sunday you're just practicing karate
moves in your garage because you can't
you know i'm saying you're too dangerous
for the public because you got all that
crazy psycho energy built up and then
monday you just attack the weights like
nuts which is perfect
super low level of fatigue time for
another progressive very productive
mesocycle
now you may be in a position after one
strength meso where you have two to
start your next meso if you have another
strength meso how do you do it
well you can keep the same exercises to
keep the momentum rolling or if you do
change the exercises
make sure they're more specific to power
lifting so for example
if you had a real productive strength
message cycle of high bar squats
either keep high bar squats in or change
to something like low bar squats which
are more specific to power lifting and
how you're actually going to compete
don't do like high bar squat strength
meso
and then a front squat strength meso
because that doesn't make any goddamn
sense it's literally the reverse so
that's the exercise guideline reduce
your volumes back to minimum effective
volume whatever gets you that basic
essential need
and then you're going to reduce your
loads to your best guess of an rp7 and
look if you're wrong in the first set
you can adjust on a second so on and so
forth
and then begin to move up and load again
that's it it's that simple
folks we'll assume you've done one two
or three
strength mesos now in the next video
once you've done them you're super
strong it's time to learn how to show
off that strength
with a proper peaking mesocycle next
time
we see you guys will do powerlifting
peaking program design
see you next week
