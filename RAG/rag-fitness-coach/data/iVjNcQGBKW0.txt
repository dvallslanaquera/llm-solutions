[Applause]
[Music]
folks
folks folks dr mike from renaissance
periodization philip harbison an npc
super heavyweight competitive
bodybuilder and as you can tell he's
really short so leg training is super
easy for him because the range of motion
can be super super small am i saying
some of that wrong probably philip are
you ready to do squats then leg curls
then leg press sets of doom oh i'm ready
my man i'm ready
let's get to it
phillip is six foot three six three
tall enough for me to not see how tall
he is because he's fucking in the clouds
sometimes it's really tough to squat
super deep when you're tall
the vast majority the reason for that is
because tall people on average have
shorter torsos relative to their height
and longer femurs which means they have
to really bend over to squat and stay
center of gravity and that can suck
luckily philip he's uh
ratios are pretty decent he has like
medium
medium height ratios and he's found a
real good technique for himself
we are using an elevated heel plate this
one is from prime excellent choice
his chest is going to stay up he's going
to sink super low he's going to do a one
count at the bottom and come up
really good technique and for him it's
probably a lot of quad emphasis
so let's get into it last one and done
last one and done big chest
quality no rush
strong
up up
beautiful
fuck good shit good shit take a break
relax under your belt whatever you need
to do it's so light
that's good stuff deep squats are hard
yeah no they fucking really are
oh that's why i've been avoiding that
shit for 12 years
philip is a fucking huge guy he's in
like the high 200s he is using 245
pounds four sets of roughly 10 in the
squat today
because he's so tall the total amount of
work force times distance is massive so
yeah the weight on the bar isn't like
psychotic crazy but it's enough to get
him
super stimulated quads that's how you
choose your weight don't chase weight
chase good technique chase excellent
execution and the weight will come by
itself
up
yes three big chest
up
rest breathe for a sec
go two
up
up all right one more let's go

good shit
good shit
incredibly heavy 240.
[Music]
how are you feeling after squats
pretty good so far pretty good that's no
good
we'll come back to how good you're
feeling after leg press so we did a
heavy squat quad movement and a lot of
times squats are so centrally taxing
it's okay to switch to a slightly less
centrally taxing movement like leg curl
hit the hamstrings later we'll come back
to quads again and hit the leg press now
there are trade-offs there all kinds of
weird stuff between systemic fatigue and
local fatigue at the end of the day if
you have a ton of energy to put it in to
the musculature training order doesn't
matter a ton
this is a quad and hamstring workout so
we definitely don't want to save
hamstrings for last last because it'll
be really really tired it'll be dog shit
so hamstrings now then we finish off
positive leg press seated leg curl great
execution sets of oh 10 to 20 reps
plenty of my reps let's get it done
hard knock
two there we go
three there we go
four rest

all right let's go over to the leg press
now that we're warmed up
that's it thank you i will carry your
face you're in no position to be
carrying anything
you're like re-learning how to walk
[Music]
leg pressing is hard when you're tall
because there's a whole big distance to
go but if you put your feet in the right
spot and you put your hips the right
spot and use our little elevator
thingies then you can do a really good
job and get an unbelievable quad workout
what we're gonna do here is probably
like three sets of eight to twelve nice
hard and heavy and then we'll do two
sets of lighter weight to really well
the lack of better term fuck shit up yes
two

philip's doing just fine
and um that means we have to finish off
the workout
so we're gonna do
one set so we did already three sets of
leg press oh sets of essentially eight
to twelve reps it was like he did 12 and
then nine and then eight
now we're going to do one set
where he's going to go really close to
failure and then i'm going to just
calmly let him rack rest and we're going
to take a plate off just one plate not a
plate off each side just one we're gonna
do that probably four times until he's
good and cooked
super super high intensity shit uh this
allows you to go really close to failure
local muscle's limiting factor it's
gonna be really tough and then maybe
we'll have some do some body weight
squats afterwards for shits and giggles
let's get it done let's get the head
right for this because this is some
intense shit
whatever it takes
