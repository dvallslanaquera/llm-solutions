leaving traces of emotion

[Music]
all right so just heading to the pm
session now for
posing routine
um
pre-judging went okay
definitely have some weak points to work
on like conditioning overall
my upper body specifically
but given this my first show i'm 20
years old
and all those people were 30 to 40 years
old it was like their
fifth the 10th show
i can't complain
um
but yeah a lot to welcome for the
offseason
just heading to pm session now where
i'll be doing my posing routine and then
we'll get awards and i'll request to
keep back from the judges so i know what
to improve on for next season
um
yeah let's get into it
thank you
videos
[Music]
all right so we're just checking into
the pumping room right now
about
maybe half an hour
proposing routines
the water being given out
i expect
[Applause]
in about 10 15
[Music]
so minutes
words are left unspoken
i am still standing where the storm is
this is the moment
[Music]
when the fire starts
it's time to rise again
[Music]
i'll strike a match and watch it come
down
and walk away because it's over now
this is my kingdom this is my crown
when the fire starts

when the
[Music]
when the fire starts
[Music]
let's see attention
[Applause]
[Music]
is
[Music]
dreams
[Applause]
oh there you go nice
so just stepped off stage um
basically as expected by kate fifth
which considering i
went to the open
as a first timer as a 21 year old
basically expected also the level of
my competitors was pretty high um
everyone was a combination of either
more conditioned or had more size than
me and more up more aside from me
um posing-wise i think i'm pretty much
my best like i don't think there was
much to be welcome posing-wise it was
just a matter of not being lean enough
um
primarily not being lean enough and then
some certain areas i was lying behind
like for example my quads and hands i
think
i was pretty competitive um my goals as
well were decent besides the
conditioning issue
but then stuff like my upper back um
just my upper body more broadly i think
needed a bit more size to be competitive
with
failed competitors
but given that most of these guys were
25 to 35 or 40
and have been competing several times
each
i don't mind too much i think it would
fairly well um
and yeah i'm right about the experience
then and it'll inform my next offseason
and
future plans for competing
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
all right so we're five guys now post
show celebratory meal
[Music]
my thoughts
good experience
thank you
i'm not that's over
um
i'm gonna use the feedback from judges
to improve the next 12 seasons i'll take
likely between two to five years at
least
to build some more size in areas i
needed to
um
this prep has really taken a toll on me
and it's not something i'll do every
year you see people in
the olympia and half-body buildings
especially
compete italy that could work if you're
quite competitive already and or from
pd's
for a lot of natural guys spending a few
years in off-season doing shows is
beneficial both mentally and also how
competition
so the plan now is quite a few years in
all seasons
[Music]
but yeah time to improve
[Music]
