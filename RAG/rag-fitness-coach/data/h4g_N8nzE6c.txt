folks I'm Dr Mike I am a jiu jitsu brown
belt that's right they gave me a belt I
colored it brown this is my Coach Josh
Vogel and we are out of the Jiu Jitsu
Company in Philadelphia Pennsylvania and
we are here to teach you fine folks a
couple of things the main one is how to
strength train for jiu jitsu to become
drum roll better at Jiu Jitsu but before
that we're going to talk about how and
why strength helps in Jiu Jitsu because
there's a lot of Gunk to be honest in
the Jujitsu Community about oh the
strength training really help oh but my
body he was strong he gassed out really
fast we're gonna squash all that and
we're gonna take 10 independent points
little teaching points to show you where
in a jiu jitsu match strength matters
how it matters and how it interacts with
technique once we're done doing that
here we're gonna go in and teach you all
of the basics of strength training for
jiu jitsu teach you how to make your own
own program so you can get strong and
jacked and finally stand up to your
landlord and then after that we'll have
some really good resources so you guys
can get stronger selves let's
go
all right folks there are at least 10
ways I can count I can only count to
like 11 or 12. so maybe there's more but
I'm not sure but there's at least 10
ways in which strength helps you a ton
in your Jiu Jitsu game and we're going
to go through all of them here's number
one these are sort of an order of how a
jiu jitsu match goes to some extent
you'll see check this out
the number one first thing to do
in pretty much every Jiu Jitsu match
well
is to eye your opponent and make sure
you look like a psycho we're just going
to do that now real quick
the cat hiss gets him every time but if
they don't do that the second thing you
do in Jiu Jitsu is assert your grips
as everyone who does Jiu Jitsu at a
higher level and above knows getting
your grips at all is a really important
thing
getting your grips in a place where you
want them to set up your next sequence
of moves is a huge thing now if Josh
happens to be super weak and he tries to
assert his grips in any way he likes I
can without a ton of effort grip break
set my own grips do all kinds of
nonsense to him but he probably doesn't
want to be done and because I get to
grips first if I'm stronger and he can't
break my grips or if I break his because
I'm stronger and get to his
he is already fighting off the defensive
the entire time how do I know this he
taught me but in any case it works in
real competition as well now if Josh has
been strength training for a while even
if he's at the same size but much
stronger than I expect when he goes for
grips
and I try to break and it doesn't work
and I go holy crap the stronger your
grip is which is a product of strength
training then if Josh has his grips here
feel free to go and start doing stuff
Josh then he can do stuff to me and it
doesn't matter how I defend
the big problem is I'm defending and
what uh what do you think about if
someone starts on the defense in a match
is that generally a good thing or a not
so good thing it's unwise
boom that's how smart he is that's all
he used to say on to the next so but on
a serious note big grips are a huge
thing and if you can assert your grips
quick and if you can assert your grip
strong and even if one grip break
doesn't occur so for example if I'm over
here and I'm like oh I know this move
and I try to grip break and it doesn't
work there is a bit of demoralization
that happens to your opponent and when
they're busy doing this what are they
not doing asserting their own grips
anywhere else so if you can assert a
really strong grip and start your game
that opponent is already on the back
foot and that's no good that's the
number one reason
not an order of importance but an order
on the sequence of a jiu jitsu match
that strength is important you're
probably wondering what's number two
let's find out
way number two in which strength can
really help your jiu jitsu in the
sequence of a match
let's say your grip fighting went well
but your opponent was the first to try a
take down
if you are stronger you have that much
more wiggle room in leeway to stuff a
takedown of course being big helps but
however big you are or are not strength
can help you shock or stuff a takedown
and then engineer some sort of take down
yourself in reversal because you just
have to take less crap from people when
you're stronger and energy directed
towards you can be more easily
redirected or actually directly
countered if you're strong versus if
you're not strong so for example
if Mr Josh Vogel Coach Josh Vogel tries
some sort of takedown on me let's say he
gets in for whatever he wants to go he's
going to try to shut me down okay yep
that's bad news and I go to the ground
but I don't train with weights and this
was quite a pretty predictable however
if he tries that take down again
as soon as he tries to pull me down
because I'm strong I don't have to go
down
because I'm strong I can stay upright
and push against him and now that he's
here what's he gonna do
I'm not sure
but fuck that literally and you guys
have seen enough Jiu Jitsu that even at
high level sometimes people just push
the other guy away and you're like
I thought I had all kinds of Jiu Jitsu
planned right now the classic push away
might not work super well but you can
use your leverages so another thing is
if Josh comes in on me
right I can use his head and push his
head away now as I'm demoing here this
looks like one of these fake Systema
videos from Russia where it's like watch
this I just touched his head and he goes
right but as he's coming in and this
happens in the real world you put a lot
of pressure on someone's head hard
you can do all kinds of stuff afterwards
but they might not have planned for even
if he Shucks it and comes back up
so if he's coming in and I shuck his
head away even if he repositions that's
a failed takedown as far as we're
concerned he expended energy and good
best thing is I'm not down multiple
points because I'm not on the ground
does this only work for Jack people no
way so if I come in and I want to do a
take note on job maybe I come in for a
single
he can sprawl out
caught me on my back
now what you guys saw him do
is he had that
outside position here if his chest right
there and his arm is really strong his
hip is strong and his tricep on the
other hand is strong he can push me away
with unreal amounts of force go ahead
and that's real bad for me
but if I can tie him up and lock him in
and we can fight a little bit yeah then
maybe I've got something here
the stronger you are
the more you can deny people takedowns
of every kind
and that's bad news for them that brings
us to point number three which is
you can take people down harder that's
up next
third reason method way in which Jiu
Jitsu is augmented by strength
is that you can off-balance people
better for takedowns we'll get to the
takedowns themselves in just a bit but
if you can off balance someone with a
huge amount of strength that
automatically means they're more
susceptible to the takedown you have
layered right after that unbalance so
for example
if Josh wants to take me down
if he's really weak he does this stuff
go ahead yeah that's nice and that
doesn't really do much to me I don't
have to make any corrections now he's in
the same spot now we're doing white ball
Jiu Jitsu we just do this and run around
right but if he's really strong one of
two things will happen the second most
ideal thing is I feel his strength so
much I over adjust and prop up
oh
and I'm done right that's it take down
successful because he was so strong
I had to not get just bowled over or
snapped down and I had to posture and
he's relying on me to get rigid in my
posture for my legs to be exposed that's
the second best thing that could happen
the first best thing is if he's strong
enough and he pushes his hips out he can
just smash me to the ground with uh with
that movement to begin with so let's
let's pretend we have halt strength for
a snapdown
beautiful now again
it may look like we're doing a fake
martial art where none of this really
works in the street
but in high level competitive Jiu Jitsu
correct me if I'm not wrong
people get snapped down to the ground
pretty regularly
and if you can barely do a pull-up with
your body weight this muscle the muscles
that do this
okay you can snap some people down
if you can do pull-ups sets of five sets
of ten that whatever body weight with a
25 pound plate hanging when you catch
someone's lapels
and you snap them down
they're gonna feel it and either they
prop up too much or they fall either way
you have a setup there's a bunch of
different ways to off balance
if you're stronger they all help one of
the ones that I like is if we're moving
around
when Josh gets in on me here
all I do is I take my hand up to the
neck and I just do like a dumbbell bench
press it's pretty straightforward I do
this now Josh is exaggerating for a
comedic effect of course but even if I'm
just a little stronger than he prefers I
push this way his leg opens up here and
I come in
if I wasn't so strong I'd do this
nothing would happen he's still stepping
and I'm like shit coach what do I do tap
I usually like to stop standing up
before the match really gets going I
tell people I'm a jiu jitsu competitor
it technically means
if I tap after five seconds I'm still a
competitor right
for five seconds your competitor yeah
all day
all right way number four in which
strength magnifies your jiu jitsu
is it gives you a larger margin of error
in real life situations in order to
actually secure and pull off any
technique starting from any kind of
takedown
yes in class when you're just learning
to move or when you're flow rolling you
can get exactly where you need to go in
order to pull off a technique for
example if we practice certain types of
takedowns in class I can secure the sort
of high crotch position here and I can
leverage it into a takedown even if Josh
tries to sprawl with this leg it's kind
of too late because I kind of already
have it set in right so I'm pretty
secure in getting that takedown in the
real world
you may not be able to put your hand in
that ideal position every single time
intellectually we can think about it
this way
if there's one tiny point and the move
doesn't work unless you touch it we can
say the sphere of effect is very small
if I have to do the karate Judo die now
chop it's only the little tiny part of
the shoulder that I'm aiming for we know
that shit doesn't work in real life
because when somebody's moving like this
you're not going to Steven Seagal that
shit oh you see that huh I could have
gotten I just wasn't feeling like it so
if we think about
if you're not so strong and you have to
get to that wraparound High crotch
position
the sphere of effect essentially is
right here if I'm not very strong and I
grab Josh here he can sprawl out and I'm
fucking done
if I'm not so strong I have to get the
right position
then I can go to all my other parts of
the technique
because I have no choice I have to have
every move go almost ideal and if you
see someone super weak being really
awesome at Jiu Jitsu they're going to be
unreal technical
because that's a good thing but also
it's their only path forward
now if you're strong enough
the Spheres start to get bigger which
means your targets are the same still
center of the sphere do I still want to
put my hand around here when I'm setting
up this takedown but just in case if I
screw up and put my hand here
if I'm not strong and I'm here Josh will
simply sprawl with his leg and I'm I'm
done I can hold on but it doesn't matter
because his leg's already away and I'm
going to be shot out the other side now
if I'm real strong and I get this here
and Josh tries to sprawl
and it doesn't work I can scoop up and
keep going
the stronger I am
the more leverage Advantage I gain
and my opponent loses
if I was to be maybe Brian Shaw or
something six nine 440 world's strongest
man I surmise that if Brian Shaw got Rey
here
would be no sprawling because he can one
arm around more than Josh can kick out
Sue would just pick you up like that and
then probably tear you in half
but the real critical point here is this
in a live situation
even in class when you're going live
with others for sure in competition and
the streets you see that ah
maybe not that in any case in the real
world
ideal positions might not actually
materialize
and then if Josh has a certain takedown
go-to go ahead and whatever you like
notice right there he's about to trip my
ass up his hand is here if he's super
weak it has to be here for the leverage
to work
if he's super strong and In the Heat of
the Moment he accidentally grabs here he
doesn't have to fuck with anything just
run it through he can actually make it
work off this and I'm still going boom
that's it because of strength now mind
you the big thing here
we're not saying that if you get strong
enough technique doesn't matter bullshit
technique matters and in a second we'll
tell you exactly why it matters even
more because of this but in a live
situation being strong means you have a
wider sphere of attack a bigger area of
attack and thus more leeway on what
techniques work and what doesn't because
if you're tired and you're gassing when
there's two minutes left you try five
takedown attempts and zero of them work
because you were off just by hair in the
positions you were going
that sucks
but if you're big and strong
specifically very strong and you just
get remotely close to where you want to
be boom all kinds of stuff can actually
work it's not the prettiest thing in the
world but it works in real life and
that's what matters alright guys so
coming up are multiple pairs of videos
each of the first Clips is a technique
being done pretty well not ideally but
pretty damn well Josh is actually trying
a little bit the second of each pair of
videos is Josh intentionally flubbing
the technique and doing it in a way that
gets it done but very meh so the thing
here is if Josh is very strong if he's
been training with weights there is a
high probability that even the matte
technique can actually get the job done
and it doesn't need to be perfect every
time in flow rolling when the partner
isn't really resisting perfect technique
every time can be a realistic goal that
can be met but in real life rolling
whether it be in competition even live
roles at the gym certainly on the
streets bang bang you're going to have a
situation where not every move is
perfect and if you have lots of strength
your probability of still accomplishing
a sweep a takedown any other kind of Jiu
Jitsu move guard pass Etc et cetera is
just going to be higher even when it's
not done ideally as you can clearly see
so while in your Technical Training you
should be trying to get the moves to be
executed as ideally as possible like the
first clip in all of these in reality as
you strength train alongside of your Jiu
Jitsu Technical Training you are going
to be able to give yourself a higher
probability that even if the move
doesn't go so well for you even if
you're trying your best and the other
person's slick they moved out of the way
you slipped it's just a real fast pace
you're tired whatever the reason if you
are stronger your ability to succeed in
moves that are not ideal expands as the
influence of each one of your little
mini spheres expands and that is a huge
huge benefit of strength training for
jiu jitsu
next reason reason number five why
strength can be super helpful to jiu
jitsu is this
there is an amazing interplay between
strength and technique
reason number four was that if your
Technique isn't spot on
strength can expand the acceptable
sphere of positions of your body through
which to actually have an effect if you
if the ideal technique requires grabbing
right on the Belt if you're stronger
maybe grabbing here Works maybe even
grabbing here Works maybe grabbing here
works for sure
now as you become more technical
what ends up happening is the position
that you grab is still the best position
is the center of that Sphere for sure
but as you become more and more
technically proficient the probability
that once you grab this the shit works
well
escalates
if I know the technique and I put my
hand in the right spot and put this in
the right spot if I'm not that good
technically yeah I'm pretty much in the
right spot but maybe my hips are off my
movement is off maybe there's a 50
chance I get the technique
if I'm strong maybe there's a 60 chance
I get that technique but also there's a
50 chance here and here 50 chance here
and here so I've widened my sphere
I haven't done a ton to make sure that I
get the technique on really technical
people but I have a more leeway now
here's this
as your Technique improves as well we
should fucking God damn well be you're
training Jiu Jitsu all the damn time
as your Technique gets better instead of
this being 50 if I get here let's say
I'm a black belt now I'm at 80 or 90
percent that means with strength and
technique the size and density of these
effect spheres start to expand such that
I used to be 50 if I got it on the money
now I'm 80 if I get it on the money I
used to be 30 if I grab here and the
coach is like do the move anyway idiot
let's try to do something now instead of
being 30 here I'm 60 here if I'm big and
I have good technique and I grab the
three inches away from the right spot I
have more of a chance of hitting the
technique than I ever did in a million
years being of low technique and low
strength
that way technique feeds into strength
until you reach like Roger Gracie or
Gordon Ryan status where the entire
person's body is a total density sphere
he just does this and you die or some
shit like that that's pure Jujitsu you
know what I'm saying that's the way I
learned it in Brazil as a child Josh is
my father he raised me there
you guys ever see Bloodsport
the first 10 minutes of that movie is
basically how Josh and I met I was
from Korea training for is that the one
with the bamboo in the um where he's
like uh kicking the bamboo tree and then
it dies or before he dies a that is a
scene from Jean-Claude in that movie you
know what folks that's good enough
because they're all the fucking same in
any case oh that's a powder one Potter
was a good movie and then always throws
the power in the dudes oh yeah that's
right and these are like this blocks
were amazing yeah I think the movie of
the tree is kickboxer oh yeah kick the
tree yeah yeah in any case if you
haven't seen those movies you should
stop watching this right now and go see
those movies because actually they're
more important than anything you can
learn from the two of us but here's the
real deal Here's the final say
there is no competition between strength
and technique and I'll tell you I'll
give you guys a stupid analogy
we can say that strength
is like the Warhead size of the missile
you're shooting from your fighter jet
the bigger the Warhead the more it blows
up you don't even have to shoot that
close to the other plane and if it's a
big enough Warhead it destroys
everything
technique is how precise the guidance
system is
if you have an unreal guidance system
yep you can shoot one bullet at a plane
and still knock it out but do you have
that guidance system no I'm not Roger
Gracie I plan on being here in a couple
after you watch this DVD you will be
Roger Gracie guaranteed literally you
can change your name
but in the real world You Bullet
Precision doesn't work so well so if
your Technique is good your homing
device for getting to where you need
it's fucking sweet and if your Warhead
is Big you got a ton of strength that
means the blast radius is Big that means
when I grab Josh on anywhere in his body
if I'm super technical and strong it's
just more and more bad news I'll finally
wake up I'm gonna try and talk that shit
I'm trying to get that Bell promotion
baby
in any case
being strong helps but it helps them
still other ways which leads us to point
number six
next way that Jiu Jitsu can be super
helped by your strength
ideally you want to move in a way that
utilizes your Technique and applies as
much strength as possible but in some
cases just a little bit of technique and
a lot of strength can go a long way
especially in very specific situations
or kind of oh shit I didn't want to beat
her emergency situations
you can use strength maybe not to assert
yourself and put yourself in a much
better position not in an advanced
position where you're on the attack at
that point your Technique really has to
be a big deal
but maybe just maybe you can get out of
a really bad spot with strength we have
to say that that is a feature of the
strength benefits of Jiu Jitsu because
you'll just see it all the time on the
mats we're not going to do a holistic
assessment of how strength can help you
without sort of mentioning this and it's
not the sexiest part of Jutsu
but it fuck it works so check this out
strength can be super super helpful and
for lack of a better term getting
somebody the fuck off of you which is a
big deal so our first example here is
going to be somebody with a really tight
heavy side control you just don't want
them around anymore you bump bump move
around if you're not using a lot of
strength it might not work if you use a
ton of strength if you have a ton of hip
strength and pushing strength you can
bump and just move the person out of the
way it's absolutely viable option the
second example we give here is a guard
break if someone is a real tight guard
and they have really lanky legs and it's
really wrapped around you it could be
hard to get out but if you're really
strong you can just stand right the hell
up they can't keep you down you
essentially just dead lift your way out
of that situation and then you can just
jerk jerk and push out and if you're
strong it can really frustrate the other
opponent giving you a huge advantage
reason number seven how strength can
radically improve your Jiu Jitsu is in a
weird way strength actually improves
your endurance
people say hey big strong guys they gas
out fast two things on that
one big guys gas out fast and if they're
fatter versus less muscular they gas out
even faster so if you have a certain
body size
making yourself stronger doesn't mean
bigger it means more muscle less fat and
then you gas out less
but if you're intelligent and especially
as you go to jiu jitsu technically you
start to be able to have better
endurance because any given move that
you do or is done to you if Josh and I
are standing here and we're pushing and
pulling and we're doing moves to each
other we get as the French say Italian
right you get very tired if Josh is huge
and way stronger than me and super
technical every time he pushes and I
pull it might take me 90 percent of my
abilities to resist or to do my own
moves
repeat efforts at 90 of your total
body's ability to move each one lasting
two or three seconds
that's going to drain the living shit
out of you now if you're really strong
in any given level of scenario
a smaller percentage of your Peak
abilities is being asked if you anytime
so if I'm really big and strong and
we're doing this kind of yes Josh is
working at 90 I'm working a 50. so after
about three or four minutes of this
white belt nonsense where we push each
other across the mat
Josh maybe Ultra super tired but because
I'm bigger and stronger specifically
stronger I only ever had to try 50 that
entire time because as you get stronger
every given effort you give in Jiu Jitsu
Falls as a fraction of your maximum
percent of effort
more strength means more endurance
unless you Spaz out and wipe out the
shit and do this and there's only ever
100 100 if you are intelligent about it
more strength means more endurance and
you even have control over it
you want to really get in there and get
really using some power moves sweet know
that your gas tank will drain but if you
have tons of strength and you decide to
just pop and move just how you need in
order to stay alive in order to set up a
good move you are really just using a
tiny fraction of your abilities and when
it comes time to give it your all you're
that much more ready
next advantage to strength no matter
what size you are more strengths is
helpful against people of your own size
it's really helpful against people
smaller than you but it's most helpful
and can make the biggest impact against
big strong people and in both Open Mat
the real world and the most important
place of all
points based ibjjf competition of course
you will run into people that are bigger
than stronger than you so it's easy for
me to do all this BS and be like oh yeah
get big and strong Josh Vogel here at
150 pounds and I'm gonna do this shut up
your Black Belt doesn't mean anything
get out of here see it's easy being
strong is fun
and if I wouldn't train much for
strength just a little to keep my
strength I'd still be a bit stronger
than Josh no big deal and if I was as
technical as him I'd be winning a bunch
of roles it'd be awesome now what if
Josh upgraded how would I deal with that
I'm Mr technical I don't train with
weights I don't need it because I'm
still bigger and stronger I got my
Natural jeans and then all of a sudden
uh shit so now I don't train because I'm
naturally strong but Josh got himself a
little promotion if you know what I mean
and uh this is a really big problem this
is actually our friend Gary He's like
six five and 300 pounds and if you run
into him all sorts of techniques seem
that they don't really wig how do you
single leg this what is going on but if
you're strong you have some sort of
Fighting Chance oh by the way Gary is
also a weightlifter so he's also getting
strong bad news for everyone so a huge
Advantage you can give yourself
especially if you're a hardcore
competitor and you love that open and
all those big Ultra boys give you
problems the stronger you get even if
you only weigh 200 pounds you go up
against a 300 pound person ask yourself
the question would you want to be a real
strong 200 pounds or like oh I'll just
catch him with my technique 200.
think about it
way number nine in which increasing your
strength can help your jiu jitsu
saving the very important for almost
last year because it hopefully doesn't
happen to you is by preventing injury
risk or sorry reducing the risk of
injury rather injury is something that
is ubiquitous to Jitsu if you train and
or compete long enough you will get hurt
how often you get hurt and how badly you
get hurt matters on a couple of factors
one is how dynamically you choose to
play the game Dynamic people get hurt
more another one is how Dynamic and
insane and white Belt Energy your
opponent is I didn't mean to point at
you at the time when I said that
easy bro
however
the third component of how often you get
injured or how bad is how fragile you
are training for strength increases the
strength of your tendons your ligaments
all of your fascial connective tissues
and the muscles themselves and guess
what your bones too
strength training top to bottom makes
you more resilient and less likely to
get hurt
that makes you better at Jiu Jitsu by
giving you if anything else more mat
time when you're not like in an ankle
brace or something like that
so
being strong doesn't just have to
express itself real world and how you
move and how you act
but if someone pushes you or tries to
take down you backstep a little bit off
of like how you're supposed to the
stronger you are the more you've been
training with weights the less likely
that will result in an injury and the
more likely you'll just reposition and
be right back into the match that's a
huge huge deal
number 10 the last reason how and why
strength increases can help your Jiu
Jitsu is a little bit less of a helpful
tale and more of a cautionary Tale
if you just get bigger and stronger all
the time
and you neglect your Technique your cap
and how good you can be in Jiu Jitsu
will be very short indeed because big
strong Jack dudes do okay but they make
all kinds of technical errors that fine
gentlemen like this are designed to
capitalize against
if you are already big and strong and
you're trying to learn Jiu Jitsu
technique especially against other white
belts early in the process you can just
with Dumb shittery and enough idiot
strength learn pretty close to nothing
for I don't know two years what's the
longest time you've seen someone learn
almost nothing and still get a belt
in 15 years 15 years
so at the end of the day if you are on
the journey to becoming bigger and
stronger or just stronger
I was going to say or just bigger but
we're not at Taco Bell uh that's a good
journey in and of itself it's fun
in any case if you are on the Journey of
becoming bigger and stronger or you're
already big and strong and thinking I
should stop strength training and lose
some strength to get more technique
don't do any of that what you should do
this is how I train
I pretty much almost never go more than
50 or 60 of my strength in any live
training situation at the gym because if
I use a ton of my strength it fatigues
the shit out of me and increases my
chance of injury like crazy it increases
my competitors and training Partners
chance of injury like crazy and it also
prevents me from learning stuff because
instead of like hey Mike do a double leg
like this I just do Hulk smash or some
shit like that there you go slow clap
you beat someone in a training room
amaze I cap my shit at 50 or 62 strength
and try to really work on my technical
qualities my technique is always
improving but what about strength well
that's improving too just in the gym
strength is to be trained in the gym
technique is to be trained here and in
about the last two or three weeks before
a big important competition every few
sessions in the gym with my training
Partners I use more strength and more
strength and more strength don't just
show up to the competition and use
strength all of a sudden because it
changes the Dynamics a bit it definitely
changes your fatigue handling if you
don't ever go with heavy with a ton of
strength in the training room and then
you go to compete and use tons of
strength after 15 seconds of flexing
your muscles you're gonna be like and
you're going to be completely gassed out
so over the period of two to three weeks
before big competition use a bit more
strength and more strength and more
strength last half week drop out the
strength just go to flowing so your body
can recover and you'll be ready all that
strength you have been building through
weight training outside of Jiu Jitsu
will be there or ready to be used
optimally by you to execute your Jitsu
you guys like my my what do you think
coach if you saw somebody on like a
subway stop doing this would you think
like oh they're doing like lapel
dragging or you're like that guy's not
unwell
I don't even know where to start with
you well a little bit of column a little
column all right so save the Jiu Jitsu
training for Jiu-Jitsu don't get in here
and do all kinds of crazy stuff your
strength is a weapon for you to use at
the time that it's right in Jiu Jitsu
you stay 50 or 60 if you're really
strong
and then as you get closer to a
competition just over the last couple
weeks really start to use their strength
because we build strength
in the gym we build a jiu jitsu
technique on the mats speaking of
building strength in Jim how the hell
are we supposed to do that don't we have
