folks hard work is the Core Essence
lifegiver of our society and Humanity
the difference I would say at least one
major major major difference possibly
the major difference between animal and
human is that humans can do concentrated
uncomfortable work self- dedicated for
longer than they want but just because
we can do that doesn't mean there's no
top end limit there's also true to say
that humans are intelligent enough to
know when the work is no longer
productive and that recovery we you
actually grow muscle by the way is the
thing to do
