have been commenting on the videos
showing your support to the channel
we really do appreciate that
so in this video well i called this
video
my fourth hardest workout of all time
and i'll just quickly mention the top
three
one was when back when i played
basketball and before i was into
bodybuilding or powerlifting
believe it or not i was a basketball
player robin still doesn't believe me
i've never actually seen him play but he
says that he was
a phenomenal basketball player
if anyone watches these videos who
i used to play basketball with please
defend me for the sake of my
relationship
anyway i play anyway
at a basketball camp we were running
suicides and
i was so exhausted that i puked in a
garbage off to the side
and then got back and finished the
suicides
that's top three another time was
when i was squatting uh after my first
bodybuilding competition
and i had the worst rebound ever i went
up like 40 pounds over stage weight
and my good friend who was in awesome
shape
wanted to uh do a
high rep squat workout with me so i i
keeled over
the toilet and almost but i didn't
and then the other time was when i was
running an accumulation phase with the
strength guys
another squat session where i had to get
the garbage bin over
and uh i think it was six sets of
eight reps uh 75 that that led to that
so i'm calling this one number four and
this is actually my second set here i
didn't film the first one
you can see my form is was pretty bad on
that first rep i'm leaning forward
uh quite a bit actually
it's not so bad when you see it from the
side it just looks like he's hanging
over from the back
and i just realized that i i talked for
a long time this is actually my third
set
so what i was while i was explaining
over the first video
that was my first set or that was my
second set this is my third set
of ten so i'm doing four sets of
350 pounds for 10.
and i think the reason that this workout
was so difficult for me was that
there's a lot of things that go into
a workout and my hips
and my back were both killing me going
into the workout so mentally that was a
lot to get over to begin with
and it can be overwhelming sometimes
jeff definitely needed my support during
this that i was
yelling at him to get through it and
here i am consoling him
because he's about to throw up i think
he just listens what we're saying here
the third set is the hardest one yeah it
it's my is this archery system
that is limited
so if you hear what i said there i said
it's my cardio
and respiratory system that's the
limiting factor in these sets and not my
strength if you look at
the actual level of difficulty in terms
of strength
uh in these sets it like robin said it
only looks like an rpe of
eight or nine but they felt so much more
difficult because i was just so
fatigued metabolically from from the
used to yell back from the volume but
they did they really looked like
this not even
and another thing about perceived level
of difficulty has to do with the fact
that
when you're aware that you've got that
tightness in your hip or you've got that
constant nagging in your upper back it
can just
lead you to think that the weight is
heavier than it is and it just feels
heavier than it actually is
so it's good to record your sets because
if you watch your speed on the
concentric
and swatch your form so if your form is
staying pretty strict and your speed is
still
pretty consistent then you're likely not
hitting
an rp 9 or 10. like you're probably like
an 8.5
at the most if your form starts to break
down or
you are really slow coming up then you
might
actually there's no one here
but that's why i like filming my sets
um so here i am doing my squats and
i did sets of eight with 125 which was a
really big pr
for me and it's it's pretty it's kind of
sad but it's pretty heavy
for me for squats especially since i've
changed my form
so i maintain really strict form
throughout these sets i'm really glad i
filmed all of them and i'm hitting
good depth it's not too much or too
little so i'm happy with that
um and yes i was keeping during my sex
too
it was just like i was heartburn to the
max
and yeah so after that i
was tempted to call it a day but i
decided i would
grind it out so to speak with my hoodie
on i put my hoodie on so you know i'm in
business
and i did my five sets of five with 75
percent
i love a little crop top
and i just like to say also that it
shouldn't be the goal of your training
to get to the point where you puke
and squat tell you puke
really isn't a good way to structure
your training philosophy
yeah you're not hardcore if you like
always peep during your like workouts
like you just need to reassess your
training
exactly and and the fact that i did get
to the point where i
felt puke actually come up and go back
down is a sign to me that i should
probably start doing a little bit more
cardio
so i can handle four sets of ten at
seventy percent better than i did on
this day
you've been like hot
um
because we didn't get videos of it um
but i did five by five with 75
and it was there was some modeling it
was an okay workout it wasn't like
super great yeah and these sets actually
felt
really easy for me and although
squatting is the primary focus of the
phase that i'm currently on i'm still
uh working on maintaining the the bench
gains that i saw from the previous dup
phase
and the bench capacity yeah and i
certainly haven't
noticed any decreases in bench strength
of anything
it just seems to be going up and up and
in between these sets i only use
something like
30 or 45 seconds rest between my sets so
they were pretty easy all right guys uh
