hey folks
dr mike here from science periodization
the
cable face pull let's find out how to do
it wrong
not do that let's find out how to do it
right and do that
remember the cable facebook is targeting
the rear delts
side delts and a ton of your traps
so let's get into the first tip
mistake number one in the cable face
bowl is super super common it's having
too
low of a range of motion very common
mistake and a bunch of lifts
so in the cable face bowl i mean if you
put a lot of weight on the bar
or you want to do more reps it's
certainly much easier
to do from here to here and that avoids
the two most difficult parts of the lift
which is the full stretch at the bottom
and especially coming
all the way up at the top now there is
such a thing as going too far we'll
cover that next
but generally speaking you want to get
to where your elbows are straight or
pretty close at the bottom
and come all the way up and more or less
take your palms and slide them to eye
level or further so you don't want to
stop here
you want to get to the front of your
face and beyond how far beyond
is up to you whatever's comfortable but
generally speaking you want to make sure
you get your hands
beyond your face which is a huge huge
benefit of this exercise
it allows you to stimulate the delts and
the traps
in a range that's kind of impossible to
do with barbells because you would
physically hit yourself in the face so
take advantage of this reduce the weight
if you have to
do fewer reps if you have to make sure
each and every rep
goes beyond your face and all the way
back down
to a relaxed position
the second mistake is doing a range of
motion
that is too high there actually is such
a thing
quite rare in many exercises but it is
possible here's the deal
a lot of folks can get to just behind
their eyes and feel just fine
but some people get into an extra credit
mentality where if they can really jam
their elbows back
then they feel like they've done
something extra now they could have in
the
side delt and rear left activation the
trap activation there is excellent
but sometimes your shoulder joints just
won't have it
sometimes your elbows just don't feel
good in that position so what you want
to do
is do the biggest range of motion you
can while your elbows and your shoulders
still
feel good so if every time you go all
the way back here your shoulders don't
feel right you've tried it for a couple
of sessions and it's not working
but it turns out if you go just to in
front of your eyes not
all the way back but just to hear
everything feels great
just do that as long as you're getting
as far up as you can go
without joint pain you're doing a good
job
the next mistake is not to have a
standard range of motion for every
single repetition
it's really easy to get into the rep
counting game and just think okay i got
to do 19 reps
that's what i did last week with five
less pounds i got to get 19
and you start doing reps and some of
them are full range of motion and good
some of them start to do a little this
some of them are back to good and then
sometimes you go all the way down but
sometimes you stop here and come back
up what ends up happening is you have no
idea how many actual full range reps you
did
it becomes impossible to track your
performance because maybe you cut your
reps this week maybe last week maybe you
got stronger
maybe you got weak or who knows and it's
also difficult to plan and overload
how do you know you're doing more this
session than last session if maybe
last session you were doing super full
range of motion and now this time you're
cutting a range you might not even be
doing more mechanical work
so what we want is to standardize the
range of motion there's actually a
pretty easy way to do that
two rules one elbows go completely
straight at the bottom and rule number
two is you want to pause for a split
second
at the top range of the motion this
gives you actually two benefits one
is it's actually easier to pause here
once the elbows past the line of your
face
it becomes a little bit more
mechanically advantageous to pull
and you'll notice that it's hardest
through here and then easier again
towards the very top
gives you an opportunity to pause here
without difficulty and
it's actually a really awesome peak
contraction for the side delts rear
belts and traps
so what ends up happening is not only do
you get probably slightly better
stimulus
but it standardizes the motion every
time so it's probably a little better
to do face pulls instead of doing this
which is totally fine a little better of
a benefit for tracking if you're having
trouble
doing the same range of motion is at the
bottom stop for a second
pause stop pause
and stop and just like that you can get
standard range of motion
and an excellent stimulus
next mistake is not controlling the
eccentric remember
concentric contraction isometric
contraction
and an eccentric slowing contraction are
all
independently hypertrophic they cause
muscle growth we don't want to miss out
on any of them especially concentric and
eccentric
the thing about the face pull is the
eccentric contraction opportunity is
incredible
we don't want to piss that away a lot of
times if you're doing something bent
with a barbell for example milking the
slow eccentric is tough
because it extends how much time you
spent moving and all of a sudden your
back starts to get tired and you start
to round over
here with a cable face bowl really
nothing else gets tired
except for your shoulders and your traps
which is what you want to get tired so
take the opportunity
to control the eccentric in every single
rep which looks like this
fast powerful concentric is totally fine
don't hit yourself in the face right
boom and then pause and then milk it out
and then
up and then slow now how slow
you know anything under control is good
what you don't want to do
is this you come up come up and
just let it crash down the purpose of
this exercise
like every hypertrophy exercise is not
just to go from point a to point b
it is to go from point a quickly and in
a good efficient pattern
back to point b in a way that stimulates
the eccentric part of the hypertrophy
process
which means you have to apply tension on
the way down
two seconds is fine three is fine even
five is fine
you can do all of those one mesocycle at
a time
so for example you can do a two second
eccentric which looks like this up
and down and up and down you can do a
three second one which looks like this
up and a little slower and up and a
little slower and you can even do a five
second eccentric
really milk it out and you can do one of
those sort of once a month
you do a two second one you accumulate
deload three second one accumulate
deload five second accumulate dealer
none of those are better than the other
they all do something slightly different
and all give you really good hypertrophy
but all of them have one thing in common
control every single time
next mistake in the cable face pull is
not leading with the elbows
the purpose of the cable face pull is to
lift the weight
in such a way that our side delts rear
delts and traps do most of the work
because we want them to be stimulated
the most we don't simply want to lift
the weight any way we can the thing is
lifting it any way you can sometimes can
make other muscles be engaged which
isn't a bad thing
they're just not the target muscle for
example if you lead with the elbows
which means being aware of your elbows
and having them track back
and just like that track your elbows up
and back just like that
if you're not leading with the elbows
sometimes your entire purpose of the
movement turns into this
i'm gonna get my palms in front of my
face well an easier way to do that
might be to use your biceps a lot your
forearm flexors and end up doing this
now you may actually be stronger but
there's a ton of foreign flexion
happening not a bad thing if this was a
bicep curl but it's not
so instead of thinking i have to get my
palms past my face
you should think i have to get my elbows
up and back and
when my palms pass my face that is a
successful descent or a successful
ascent rather so here's the deal
instead of just thinking okay palms to
face okay
that's one rep that's two rep that's
actually zero reps think
elbows back and then oh palms past the
face that's good elbows back palm past
the face that's good
that way we know the way the movement
occurs it actually stimulates the
muscles that we want
next mistake is not much of a mistake
but a sort of guideline of where to pull
it's a big question
where do we actually pull the face pull
apparatus
do we pull towards our chin do we pull
towards the nose we can also pull to
above eye level
some folks even like to pull over okay
i wonder which one is true there's
another question that arises
where do we set the pin height if we set
it low
we're sort of a little bit more
replicating an upright row with a cable
okay if we set it really high
all right let's see if i'm strong enough
to do this
thanks a lot rusty machine if we set it
high actually above eye level
we end up pulling sort of a little bit
down perhaps getting a little bit more
of the back
involved what is the answer to which one
is optimal
well it turns out they just engage
slightly different muscles
specifically if you pull from a low
position you get a bit more upper traps
and sometimes a bit more side delts if
you pull
from a high position you get more rear
delts and more mid and lower traps
and less side delts and less upper traps
is there a right answer there
with everything in between absolutely
not they're just variations of the same
thing so it's almost like various
presses for chest
they just hit different parts of the
chest one isn't really a better chest
exercise than another
it just means what you want to hit and
here's another consideration
where you pull to your face with all of
these heights
is also about where you feel at the most
are you feeling it in the muscles that
you're targeting
is there tension perception in the rear
delts versus side delts depending on
what you want
is there a pump in the traps in the
place you want versus not and
joint comfort really really big deal so
what you want to find
is any number of variations that hit
your target muscle where you want oh
yeah hell yeah that was definitely rear
dealt and
at the same time feel really good
especially for your elbows
and your shoulders now some folks have
some wrist problems with this exercise
we'll address that in a little bit
but the deal is if your elbows and
shoulders feel good and you're feeling a
target muscle where you want
there's no right answer feel free to use
different pulls so sometimes people pull
narrow
sometimes they pull wide totally fine
just now when i pulled wide for you guys
on video
my right shoulder didn't like that
particularly that's probably not
something i'll be doing again
and i know from past experience that
doesn't feel great so when i do these i
pull relatively narrow and it feels
great
you got to find your own way there's no
exactly right answer but if your joints
feel good and you're feeling in the
target muscles consistently apply the
same position
and the same pulling every single time
for weeks and weeks and weeks and you
absolutely will see benefits and don't
be afraid to change it up every now and
again including
changing this dildo rope attachment
thing
to any number of other cables if it
feels good you're absolutely clear to do
it
next mistake super common one body
english or aka cheating
it's really tempting to put a ton of
weight on there get a ton of reps
and start doing a heave-hole kind of
 getting the rest of your body
going
remember the target is side delts rear
delts and traps just use
those right if you have to cheat and get
on your tippy toes
for a face pull you have to re-evaluate
a whole hell of a lot more about where
your life is going
next mistake is the opposite of swinging
too much
it is trying to be extra strict for
potentially no reason at all
so some folks will say you have to keep
your scaps locked in but
i can almost promise you that most
people
who say you have to lock your scaps just
like that are one of two camps
people coaching competitive lifters and
powerlifting or people that are pretty
much close to insane
and thinks everything in the gym gets
you hurt all right you gotta lock those
scaps in otherwise
i don't know magic crazy will
happen you're gonna die
all right here's the deal can you lock
your scaps and do face pulls
with locked scapulae yes it is a way to
do the exercise
but a better way is to actually let your
scaps retract and protract
which makes this not only a rear delt
side delt exercise but a trap exercise
as well
so it's totally fine to be super strict
just don't think you have to do it
be strict for what the exercise is and
because it involves the traps
this is fine and there's a huge
difference between
protracting and retracting versus
swinging and cheating
if your core is stable you're good to go
and if you protract and retract that's
totally fine if you choose
to keep your scabs stable that's fine
just make sure you're doing it for the
right reason
which may be a slightly better stimulus
to fatigue ratio for the side delts and
rear delts but even
that is not guaranteed every single time
do what feels best for you and feels
best for your joints don't be afraid to
move those gaps around
all right next mistake this is actually
super common and i used to do it a lot
is uh not having devices to aid your
grip
believe it or not when your shoulders
get big enough and strong enough
it actually is profoundly difficult to
hold the average rope
and not have your grip be a limiting
factor and i'm sure tons of you watching
right now are like damn it
my grip is a limiting factor on this
exercise don't let it be there's our
three
remedies for grip number one is chalk um
it works fine
your gym might not appreciate you
putting chalk everywhere especially on
the rope but
other users of the rope will appreciate
it after chalk is totally cool and it
may work for some time
straps are cool so you put them on and
you wrap them around it takes a bit of
extra effort but it's really good
and of course the versa grip again i'm
not paid to say this first script
doesn't even know i exist
uh amazing amazing product you take the
verses you wrap them once around
and all of a sudden not only can you
lift more weight and do more reps
because your grip is not limiting
but you can focus all of your mental
efforts on doing the technique correctly
and not about if you're gonna let go of
the bar
anytime soon the last mistake
on the cable facebolt is going too heavy
we have three fundamental hypertrophy
rep ranges if you can conceive of it
this way
the 5 to 10 rep range the 10 to 20 rep
range and the 20 to 30 rep range
the 5 to 10 rep range is a tough sell
for this exercise
because it's just very technically
demanding
and it might not do a whole lot if you
do it for sets of 5 to 10
also it tends to seem that the shoulders
just aren't big fans
of super super heavy weight lifted
through this kind of range of motion
in addition to that there are a lot of
other exercise barbell upright rows for
example that do a real good job
of targeting the same muscles but they
are much more conducive to heavy lifting
now you can do sets of 5 to 10 if it
works for you
that's not my first recommendation but i
recommend sets of 10 to 20
are real good but even sets of 20 to 30
are awesome on this exercise
maybe mile rep style with short rest
brakes super awesome
for torching your side notes rear adults
and traps this is the exercise in which
to go light
go for super high quality reps really
focus on the peak contraction of the
quality
other exercises are better for heavy
hardcore stuff
folks that's all i have this time enjoy
cable face pulling so that your
side delts and traps and rudolph gets so
big that you
finally have happiness see you next time
for the next video
