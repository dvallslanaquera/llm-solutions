so a bodybuilder is going to teach a
power lifter how to post I don't think
I'm really able to teach them too much
I'm just by judging by what you're doing
already should you have shade before wow
most people do the power of Judge even
getting extra credit for the
hair around another regions
are you naked with me yeah should we
have like porn music playing we just
face each other how come my shoulders
don't look like yours you lost your
phone oh yeah that's what it is
I'm not lean enough to really see which
muscles need to I mean I can see enough
yeah it's like do you see my stegosaurus
but that this looks good on you like for
where your physique's at right now this
looks nice
do I need to look somewhere oh oh that's
the way wow how come we look so
different
why you look better than me thank you so
much Jared for teaching me how to pose
I've never actually gotten a uh actual
lesson I'll have to do another one at
the end of your cut this next cut yeah
yeah
