hey folks dr mike israetel here for
renaissance periodization
asking a very strange question in
today's talk is periodization important
for muscle growth hold on a second a
company that pays my bills
is got periodization in the name i sure
hope it's important
well let's find out how hypocritical i
can be so
first of all what is periodization we
already have a problem right here
the formal definition of periodization
in sport science is
the manipulation of training variables
to enhance progress reduce injury risk
and time peak performances and that's
all of training actually that
encompasses the entire training process
so periodization is really another way
of seeing the modern approach to
organizing
training but what most people think of
periodization is not that
what most people think of periodization
is the use
of distinct phases usually
weeks long each in sequence to
accomplish some sort of long-term goal
for example hypertrophy training then
strength training
then power training to become the best
power athlete you can be like that's
what people say that's periodization
right and they're not completely wrong
because it's a part of it but it's just
not the whole thing
another way we can think about it is
splitting up training into cycles
is something that people think about as
periodization the microcycle the
motorcycle the block
and the macrocycle and that's
essentially the same
idea as the sort of phasic approach to
training
now that actually has its own term it's
part of periodization it's called phase
potentiation
face potentiation is not all of
periodization it's just a small part of
it but that's what people say
when they well that's what they mean
when they say periodization
so when people say is periodization
important in hypertrophy training or for
muscle growth
what they actually mean to say is is
face potentiation important
because nobody thinks that organizing
your training is not important for
muscle growth
of course periodization is important so
this lecture should be titled
is face potentiation important for
muscle growth we didn't title that
because you know what i'm saying the
youtube algorithms will not be kind to
that because nobody knows the help
potentiation in so but now we're on the
same page we're using the colloquial
definition
of periodization which really has a
definition of sport science is
phase potentiation the idea that doing
one kind of training right now
will improve your results in another
phase of training later
will improve your results later and so
on and so on and so on it's splitting up
the training into distinct
phases and blocks which is known as face
potentiation
now what are the actual effects of face
potentiation
in hypertrophy training okay so
phase potentiation sequences weeks
in incrementally more difficult manner
in an accumulation phase
to form the actual accumulation phase
face potentiation says that what you do
in one week
changes what you're gonna do in the next
and that sets up the next week this is
why we don't go all the way to crazy
failure with super high volumes in week
one of a program
because we know that week two leaves us
nowhere to go we know we're gonna hold
it back a little bit in the first week
so that the next week is going to be
tougher
and more overloading and then more and
more and more and then that sets up all
the other weeks so we have great
productive training
you can kind of think of it like a full
course meal
the appetizer is good for its own sake
but it also sets you up for the sense
experience
 if i know i don't know anything
about fine dining but i assume that the
appetizer
sets you up for the excellent main
course and then the excellent main
course
does its own job well but it's also not
too much food so you have room for
dessert
and the main course paired with the
proper dessert one sets up the next and
so on and so on and so on so that's kind
of how it works in training
the accumulation and deload phase
sequence so we have an accumulation
phase and then a deload phase
that's an example of face potentiation
right because the accumulation phase
has to have a deload phase after it and
the deload phase before this next
accumulation phase
sets up the next positive accumulation
phase the sequencing
of tougher and tougher mesocycles back
to back to back so
a relatively high volume as a cycle a
much higher volume as a cycle where you
go closer to failure and use more crazy
stuff
and then one last muscle cycle of a
training block in which you do stuff
that's just not sustainable for any more
than one mesocycle
and potentially sequencing entire blocks
of roughly three mesocycles
with training blocks or training phases
that are much easier to bring down tons
of fatigue
so it's kind of like accumulation deload
that happens on a grand scale of
easier mesocycle tougher mesocycle
toughest mesocycle that's a training
block
sequenced with an active recovery phase
active rest phase
or a resensitization phase or something
like that
so all of this is an example of face
potentiation
is in hypertrophy training and the
effects of it are very notable
after years of applying it yeah you
might not be able to take any low volume
or active rest phases
for months and you'll be totally fine
but after years you will pay a price
and for the advanced these effects are
incredibly notable
and we'll get back to that later as to
what that really means
however for beginners which are by
definition people haven't been trained
that long
there's almost no effect so if someone
says hey do i need to face potentiate as
a beginner
i'm usually like dude just train pretty
hard
and work on really good technique and
stick to
consistency and adherence if you get
really tired take a week off
or a week of much lighter training again
there's some face potentiation in there
but it's really just not that big of a
deal
right it's like getting a computer and
you don't do any gaming
at any high-end computing at all and
you're looking at how important is the
graphics card like
you know it's good to have a good one
but really you're not going to run into
that problem
right and for intermediates
in the medium term in the case of like
months and remember almost all studies
on this
are on beginners for months maybe weeks
and sometimes intermediates for months
or weeks
there's almost no actual effect that's
detectable right so this stuff only
really shows itself
after months and years especially in the
advanced
so if you're watching this and you're a
beginner i mean it's cool to know
 like that but if you're watching
this for like okay how do i use face
potential for my own training
don't even worry about it so we already
answered part of the question
is periodization important to beginners
and not really
to intermediates you got to start kind
of figuring it out and then too advanced
yes very important especially in the
long term but if you're advancing you
only try it for a few weeks which i
don't even know
what there is to face potentiate much in
a few weeks then you'd be like ah it's
all
periodization it's all super over
complicated just train hard brother
you're gonna run into some problems and
we'll show you what kinds
all right so if
face potentiation doesn't actually make
a big difference for intermediates
what does make a big difference for
intermediates what should you be
focusing
as far as the whole background of
periodization if face potentiation is
not it
then what should be the focus well of
all the training principles face
potentiation here abbreviated as pp
and i posted this on my instagram a
while back as a preview and
everyone in the comments made peepee
jokes so please feel free
to make your best peepee joke in the
comments below
and uh i wish youtube offered people the
chance to comment with uh photos because
you could
post a photo of your pp as well i'll be
posting mine later
so face potentiation is actually second
to last on a list of importance of
training principles
and these are the training principles
that are the totality of periodization
there's a whole bunch that come before
that are way more important
and because intermediates need the more
important stuff first because
the other details just haven't gotten to
them yet which won't make a big
difference
we got to focus on the first three main
training principles
that focus is going to be where
intermediates get the most bang for
their buck
they need to focus on specificity
overload and fatigue management what
does this mean
i'll give you the most easy quick
real-world definition
of what these actually mean in
hypertrophy training
for specificity for intermediates that
means
train the muscles you want to grow with
exercises and techniques
that target the muscles as limiting
factors
so if you're doing curls and the reason
you go to failure is because your
shoulders are tired
no bueno or if you're doing rows
and you mostly feel your lats and your
lats are what get tire out and that's
why you can't row anymore
and you're saying i'm training my arms
like no you're not okay so for
intermediate for beginners yeah they can
get big arms doing rows
intermediates when they're doing curls
it has to be like oh my god i feel this
a ton of my bicep
and the reason i can't do one more rep
is because my bicep is a limiting factor
that's how specificity applies to
intermediates and that's very very
important
how is it here's an example people will
say hey look um i'm doing tons of squats
like everyone said when i was a beginner
it worked
but like squats just don't grow my quads
anymore what do i do well as an
intermediate it's time to really focus
on specificity
so it's time to ask yourself do i feel
my quads in the squat like
not really i mostly feel my glutes is
are the quads what fail
when i'm squatting all the way close to
super close to failure like no actually
my lower back just starts to get tired
and that's why i have to rack the weight
well gee whiz you're doing a really bad
job on specificity that's the most
important training principle so it's
noticeable it's no surprise your quads
aren't growing
so either alter your squat stance or
switch to another exercise as a first
exercise that
really taxes your quads maybe you switch
to hack squats as a first exercise still
squatting but later in the program
and it's just like every single set when
you get close to failure
your quads are it they're the target
they're limiting factor
you will get bigger quads that way so
it's super important that you get that
right
otherwise you just float along for years
not growing certain muscles because
you're actually violating the
specificity principle which is the most
important principle of periodization
number two overload it means train hard
and make the training harder over time
and that requires a lot of mental
fortitude you may not want to lift
300 pounds because you used to be able
to get bigger legs at 250. you got to go
255
260 you've got to do more reps right
what does that would greg descent say
train harder the last time like you know
my iago impressions not that not as good
as it used to be
gilbert godfrey but greg just said
as much beef as we've had he's got a
great point right fundamentally overload
means training harder
maybe not then the exact last time but
look over time you gotta train harder
if you look back to last august and the
leg workouts you were doing were
objectively more difficult than the ones
you've been doing now
you can lie to yourself and say you're
draining gaining a lot of muscle
you're not and some people will
literally say and i've had people tell
me this like
dude like so to get my legs this size i
had to squat like
four or five for a set of six what do i
have to do to get bigger legs i'm like
well
let's get the rocket surgery out and
think uh
more more than that it could be less
weight but way more reps it could be
different machines but more
apps more challenge and yeah eventually
that means you're doing crazy stuff
remember
marcus rule uh if gu youtube him if you
don't know who that is
r-u-h-l i think
when he had one of the biggest chests of
all time he physically couldn't move his
body around his chest
there's video of him uh smith machine
incline pressing like
five plates for sets of six what the
and do you think he would do that if he
didn't have to do it to get a bigger
chest of course not but
that's the only thing that got his chest
bigger so challenging yourself is the
huge focus
after making sure that the challenge is
focused on the muscle itself so
specificity and then overload and lastly
and a lot of intermediates miss this
last part fatigue management
is crucial and for them that means
first of all not training more than they
can recover from if you've tried 20 sets
of chests for weeks on end and your
chest just gets tired and you get weaker
and you get hurt stop doing that try 10
sets of chest
per week and see if you can slowly work
up to 12 or 15.
that's much better you'll get much
better growth so don't do more than
you're going to recover from on an acute
basis
and on a chronic basis every roughly
four to eight weeks you're gonna have to
take it easy either take a week off
or take a week of deload to refresh and
recharge and keep going
intermediates who train specifically
what they want with limiting factors as
the muscles they target
who train hard and go uh over the course
of time make their training harder
and who don't exceed more than they can
recover from from
until the last week of a massive cycle
in which they deal it and repeat
they're going to see awesome awesome
games okay that's the core
don't worry about phase tension and all
that other crazy stuff now
when does face potentiation actually
become more important
well just by sticking to specificity
overload and fatigue management
you'll get amazing gains for years maybe
the first five years of your training
career maybe even longer now
eventually towards the end of that
five-year period you'll have to start
focusing
on the training principles that are
between the first three and face
potentiation which is to say
you'll have to start thinking about sra
stimulus recovery adaptation
in other words you'll have to find a
frequency that works for you
for some muscles and maybe start
altering your frequency a little bit
here and there like
you can get great gains training your
biceps once a week for a little while as
a beginner but as an intermediate you
might realize that two and three time
week bicep training
just works way better and someone i may
have told you here's a really great
program where you chain your hamstrings
four times a week
but you can't do that because you can't
personally recover from it so you might
have to adjust your frequency to two
times a week or something like that
variation right variation is something
you'll have to figure out you'll have to
choose the right exercises for you
you'll have to choose the right loading
ranges or the fractions of the loading
ranges you use do you train mostly heavy
mostly lighter mostly in between
and the right kind of tempos do you do
slow eccentrics when do you do those
and of course knowing when to rotate
them in and out when have squats become
stale
when have leg presses become stale when
is it time to replace with hack squats
so on and so forth
and of course all of this is threaded in
with individualization
which one of these work best for you and
maybe not
you know on paper they work for everyone
but for you some of them work really
well some not
so learning yourself is a big part so
you'll be doing a lot of that
but after a few years of doing all of
that but not doing phase potentiation
you'll notice a few things predictably
almost everyone does
your deloads will no longer get rid of
all of your fatigue
right there's some psychological fatigue
some hormonal fatigue and some joint and
connective tissue fatigue
that just hangs around longer than a
week and you'll realize that
longer phases of easier training two to
four weeks of active raster
resensitization
will just be something you have to do
otherwise you won't be able to train
hard continuously
after you come back from such down times
and if you guys want some insight on
this watch the ronnie coleman joe rogan
interview
where he talks about coming back full
steam after time off and getting hurt
right there in that first session he
said i stopped doing that and instead of
squatting
600 pounds for reps the first time i
come back from the gym after a long
layoff i went to 300 and then worked my
way up
which is insulting it's ronnie coleman
why is he squatting 300 pounds he
realized if you just get hurt
you're going to start to realize that
after you come back from down times
going full steam like crazy is a really
really bad idea so your first mesocycle
back
you'll train pretty hard but ease into
it your second mesocycle after that
you'll be able to train meat potatoes
like you always did
and then you realize that the super high
frequencies and high volumes that you
can handle the very highest
can be done maybe for one last mesocycle
but then you just you're done and you
have to take that active recipe so you
can
buy yourself a little bit of time to do
your best best best but then it falls
off
so in the end you're gonna have
rediscovered this face potentiated
structure
that's what you're doing right you are
now
taking longer phases of rest you are
coming back and sequencing mesocycles
from
easiest or least hard to more hard
to hardest unsustainable relax
and repeat and now you're doing face
potentiation you sort of just walked
into and here's the deal
almost all pro bodybuilders do it
whether or not they call it that and
most of them don't
because most of them don't have sport
science degrees but they don't need them
because they've intuitively
landed to this reminder though science
is still important because
some folks you know intuitively will
land there
and be successful some folks will get
career ending injuries or burn out
completely
before they ever do it we have a
survivorship bias people say well the
pros know it all we are the ones that
are left over
but how many people had they known sport
science before would have succeeded
but because they didn't they have to
discover the hard way remember
trial and error works really well if you
succeed
trial and error if it's on an individual
basis means you aired you tore your quad
off your bone
you don't get to continue trial and
error so it's always good to have this
knowledge ahead of time
that you don't have to discover for
yourself but over time bodybuilders on
the aggregate
they have discovered this for themselves
and most do it most pros take
one to three months off every single
year off
of the gym and all the special support
supplements and all that stuff or they
just do super easy training a lot a lot
of guys just take that time off
per year again ronnie coleman interview
with joe rogan a lot of people are
surprised it took three months off after
every single olympia
show period and he needed it right
because he was pushing so hard he had to
have some downtime
and most pros in addition to taking that
much time off per year sometimes all at
once sometimes in sequence phases
most of them when they start back they
start back easier
then they have a distinct time when
they're getting into their groove and
then lastly usually before contest or at
the end of a massing phase
they have a time when they know they are
pushing unsustainably
and then they drop everything back down
rinse and repeat and do that all over
again so the best already do face
potentiation
and you'll have to as well when you're
close to that level for now if you're a
beginner intermediate
focus on specificity overload
fatigue management slowly work into
training frequency and all that other
stuff
and eventually keep your eye on face
potentiation because your body will let
you know
when it becomes super important folks
thanks for tuning in
see you next time
