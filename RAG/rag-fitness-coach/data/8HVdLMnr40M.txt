extreme you go hard your workouts are
amazing and you put some of those on
there
and then uh i also you also post your
cheat meals
yes it's very important the cheat meals
is this true we've been told that things
like cheat days diet breaks and refeeds
are important for boosting metabolism
enhancing fat loss fueling the muscle or
maybe just giving yourself a break
mentally
but what does the science say about this
well i want to start by looking at three
different plans for fat loss person a
eats 2
000 calories every day no high carb days
no calorie cycling
no cheat days we'll call this the
continuous diet
person b eats 1800 calories monday to
friday and then refeeds on the weekends
by eating 2500 calories per day mostly
through
increased carbohydrate so their average
weekly calories are the same
but person b's calories are distributed
non-linearly
through the week and we'll call this the
refeed diet and person c follows the
same continuous diet as person a and
they do that for weeks one to four
but this time for all of weeks five and
six they pop their calories up to
maintenance intake
so they include this full two week diet
break once every month or so
where they're eating 2500 calories and
we'll call this
the diet break approach now let's say
person a b and c
are identical twins with the same
metabolism and same
training habits who do you think will
see the most fat loss
after a few months of dieting well after
digging into the science on this
the answer actually surprised me so
let's take a look at the continuous diet
first
this approach is nice because it's the
least complicated you just eat the same
intake
every day until you hit your goal weight
but there are a number of reasons to
think it's probably
less optimal when compared to the other
two now some people might have the
knee-jerk reaction to think
well as long as you're in the same net
caloric deficit the results should be
the same
it doesn't matter if it looks continuous
like this or if it looks something
more like this with tiny intakes through
the week and then two really big cheat
days on the weekend
or even something more like this with
super tiny intakes through the week and
one giant cheat day on the weekend
all that really matters is that over a
given time period you're eating less
calories than you're expending
if you are you'll lose weight if you're
not you'll gain weight
while this impulse is sort of true in
the sense that net caloric balance will
ultimately dictate whether or not you
lose weight
it also implies that caloric balance is
the only thing that matters
which isn't true how you apply that
deficit over time
can impact how well you lose fat and
more importantly
how much you change your body
composition for example the time course
itself matters
this popular study from garth and
colleagues found that when they put one
group on a faster diet
and one group on a slower diet even
though both groups lost the same amount
of weight
the group that dieted more slowly lost
more fat
and retained more muscle so even when
you apply the exact same caloric deficit
how you apply that deficit can impact
what you look like coming out the other
side
so with that in mind let's take a closer
look at the refeed approach
now as far as i can tell refeeds
actually started out as these cheat
meals or cheat days that bodybuilders
would do once every week or two
to either boost their metabolism or
maintain some semblance of sanity
on their otherwise very restrictive diet
and while i think there is something to
be said for having periods of time where
you aren't restricting
psychologically the biggest downside of
the classic
bodybuilding cheat day is that you risk
increasing your weekly caloric
intake so high to the point that you
actually take yourself
out of a deficit and stall fat loss so
most coaches that i know
usually don't recommend them for fat
loss these days but as a potential
solution
some have proposed the 24-hour refeed
which you can think of as a more
toned-back cheat day so instead of just
eating
everything in sight you instead bump
your calories up to maintenance intake
so the number of calories you need to
maintain your weight or slightly higher
than maintenance for 24 hours
however the issue with this approach is
that from the research we have
it seems like it might take at least 48
hours so two to three days
to see any increase in metabolic rate
and you probably want at least
48 hours of refeeding to replenish
glycogen for improving training
performance
that's because we seem to need upwards
of 10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram
of body weight
for full glycogen replenishment when in
a depleted state so if you weigh 180
pounds or 80 kilos
you need upwards of 800 grams of carbs
to see full glycogen replenishment so
i'd say it's more practical to do two
consecutive refeed days
at 400 grams rather than one day at 800
grams
and in fact this is exactly what i'm
doing with my physique client pat right
now
he's currently 185 pounds and his macros
on his five low days look like this
so he's at 270 grams of carbs and then
for two days in a row
we bump his carbs up to 400 grams per
day so when you do the math out he's
averaging 2600 calories per day which
has him losing about one pound
per week while still gaining strength in
the gym and still maintaining a nice
full look especially in the day or two
following the refeed we also try to time
the refeed so it's one or two days
before a high volume training session
that way he's going into the hardest
workout of the week feeling full
and re-energized so the 48 hour refeed
approach certainly has a solid
theoretical basis
and it is a method that i'll use as a
coach however despite all the buzz
around cheat days and refeeds over the
last few decades
up until last year there actually wasn't
a single study
investigating their effects in trained
lifters directly so
lucky for us in march of 2020 a team of
researchers led by dr bill campbell
gave us exactly the study we've been
looking for they split 27 trained male
and female subjects into two groups and
put them on a diet for seven weeks
one group ate in a continuous deficit of
25 percent below maintenance
and the other group ate 35 below
maintenance for five days
followed by two days of refeeding at
maintenance and to be clear
both groups were in the same average
caloric deficit for the week
the only difference was that one group
did re-feeds and the other didn't
they put the subjects on an upper lower
training split and at the end of the
seven weeks
found that the group doing refeeds lost
less fat free mass
meaning they most likely retained muscle
better and they also preserved
resting metabolic rate better however
both groups did end up losing the same
amount of fat
so since this is the highest quality
evidence that we have on refeeds
i currently view them less as a one
weird trick for burning belly fat
and more as a strategy for potentially
improving muscle retention
and preserving metabolism on a cut and
from my coaching experience
i'd say they're also helpful for
improving muscle fullness especially in
the day or two following the refeed and
perhaps more importantly
for simply breaking up the monotony of
the diet okay so what about diet breaks
well this is where things get really
interesting unlike a refeed which
normally only lasts a day or two
a diet break usually lasts at least two
weeks and often times longer
now in the last few years this has
become a very popular strategy in the
natural bodybuilding world
where most of the top coaches these days
have moved away from the traditional
10 to 12 week contest prep diet which
really ends up being a crash diet in the
end
and toward a much slower paced diet
interspersed with these two to four week
diet breaks
so i've definitely seen their success in
the field especially when digging into
ultra low body fat zones
but successful anecdotes are easy to
cherry pick so it's important to also
look at what the scientific evidence
has to say so the first study on diet
breaks came out in 2003
when researchers discovered that they
might have a benefit for fat loss
completely by accident the study split
subjects into three groups the first
group dieted continuously for 20 weeks
the second group took one long six week
diet break in the middle
and the third group took these three
evenly spaced two week diet breaks
and during those diet breaks the
subjects were just instructed to eat
freely they weren't told to be in a
deficit or eat at maintenance or
anything
and what i find most interesting is that
these researchers included these diet
breaks
to try to induce weight gain but it
didn't work
all three groups ended up losing the
same amount of weight in the end
which sparked the idea that maybe using
these prescribed diet breaks could
actually be helpful for weight loss over
the long term
so flash forward to 2017 when this study
from burning colleagues got a lot of
buzz in the science-based fitness
community
because unlike that first study which
basically found that these uncontrolled
diet breaks don't actually hurt weight
loss
this new study found some pretty
spectacular benefits from using more
controlled diet breaks
so just to keep it simple this time they
had two groups one group dieted
continuously for 16 weeks
and the other group dieted for two weeks
then took a two week diet break
then dieted for two weeks then took
another two week diet break and just
repeated that for the length of the
study
so two weeks in a deficit two weeks at
maintenance repeat now because the
researchers wanted all the subjects to
be in a deficit for the same
total length of time the people using
the diet breaks ended up dieting for 30
weeks rather than 16.
so the total length of the intervention
was about twice as long for the group
doing
diet breaks but here's the amazing thing
the group doing diet breaks ended up
losing
50 percent more fat and their resting
energy expenditure
or metabolism was preserved twice as
well so as you can see here in the graph
both groups metabolisms slowed down at
first but then sort of rebounded in the
diet break group
so that by the 16 week mark the subjects
doing the diet breaks had significantly
faster
metabolisms but it's actually even
better than that the folks using the
diet breaks
also had better results in a six month
follow-up after the study ended
in other words not only did the diet
breaks cause significantly more fat loss
and preserve metabolic rate better
they were also able to maintain their
fat loss much better
after the diet and after the study was
over so
this was pretty incredible the only
downside of doing diet breaks was that
the total length of the diet took about
twice as long
but even this can be seen as a good
thing we've already discussed research
showing that slower rates of weight loss
tend to preserve muscle better and
besides if you're trying to maintain
your fat loss after the diet ends anyway
what's the big deal if it takes a couple
extra weeks or even a couple extra
months to get there
and i personally think the reason that
there was more sustainable fat loss with
diet breaks
is that those subjects were getting more
of what you could call practice with
being at maintenance
basically over the course of the study
they got more experience with what it
feels like to eat at maintenance
calories whereas the group
without those maintenance periods were
just dieting the whole time
and then when the diet was over they
simply weren't used to maintaining their
weight
they may not have known how to do that
whether consciously or subconsciously
now of course if you're dieting for an
event like a bodybuilding show or a
photo shoot
even though it might be nice in theory
you may not have enough time to use diet
breaks
but again this is why i think most of
the best coaches these days
tend to require more dieting time from
the get-go
but the story also doesn't end there
because as promising and as exciting as
this study was
it was done on non-exercising obese men
so it isn't clear if these outstanding
results would translate to healthy
active
weight training men and women so to help
us answer that question
enter this brand new study from february
2021
and i'll just spoil it this time the
results weren't as impressive
to cut right to the point after 12 weeks
of dieting the diet break group and the
continuous group
both lost the same amount of fat
retained the same amount of muscle
and there were no differences in
metabolic slowdown and this came as
quite the surprise to many people in the
evidence-based community
because the results of the previous
study and all the in the trenches
coaching experience
were also positive that it was hard to
imagine that a study would find
basically nothing at all but here's the
thing they didn't find nothing at all
when it came to the psychological
outcomes there were obvious benefits
all stacked in favor of diet breaks they
reported lower hunger
lower desire to eat and greater diet
satisfaction
which i think would likely translate to
greater diet adherence and diet success
over the long run and i think this is
the critical piece to the puzzle
it's possible that the reason that the
earlier study saw such incredible
results
is that the obese subjects simply stuck
to the diet better
when doing diet breaks we know adherence
can be an issue in nutrition studies
and as much as researchers do their best
to keep their subjects on track
if the diet break group simply had a
better time adhering to the protocol
that could explain many of its apparent
physiological benefits as well
so as it stands right now putting that
first accidental study aside we have one
study showing an enormous
positive effect on fat loss metabolic
preservation and the long-term weight
maintenance
in obese subjects and another study that
found significant benefits for
psychological factors
like appetite and adherence and leaner
well-trained subjects
so to me the evidence still leans in
favor of using diet breaks
especially if you have a lot of weight
to lose if you're already pretty lean
and weight training regularly
the purely physiological merits of diet
breaks may be less impressive than we
previously thought
but i'd still lean toward using them
especially if you have the time
even if just for the psychological
factors okay so coming back to these
three diets from the beginning
after looking at all the literature on
this i think that while the continuous
diet certainly
can work i'd also say it's probably the
least optimal for most people
at the very least we can say it's often
worse when it comes to adherence and
appetite
and possibly worse when it comes to
muscle retention and metabolic
preservation
as for the other two i think 48 hour
refeeds do have a bit more scientific
support at the moment when it comes to
lean
trained individuals but for people who
are overweight or obese
diet breaks do have some really
impressive benefits and if you're
someone who's looking to get shredded
unfortunately there aren't many studies
to draw from but going by what the best
coaches are doing i think using some
combination of both makes sense
but the bottom line being that giving
yourself more time than you think you
need to diet
is always good advice and regardless of
your situation i'd say one of the best
things that you can do is experiment
with each of these approaches
and find out what works best for you and
your goals also i want to give credit to
