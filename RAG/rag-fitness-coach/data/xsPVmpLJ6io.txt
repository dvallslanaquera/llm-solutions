I was responding the client's okay and
some yogurt I put freedom me over but
the fruit looked pretty and how it
doesn't anymore

almost forgot I just slammed a way shake
right before training because it took a
while for me to reply to some clients
after breakfast and now I'm doing my
pre-workout things so scoop a hide Robin
got hide and ritual mixed together
to two total scoops and I throw extra a
little bit of creatine and beta-alanine
on top because the dose isn't haider
yeah they're kind of poverty that can
focus on it there's a hundred milligrams
of creatine 2500 beta alanine so I'll
add about another three grams of
creatine and another gram or two of beta
alanine just for safe measure
