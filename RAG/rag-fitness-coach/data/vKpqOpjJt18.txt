hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization jared feather also here
for renaissance spiritization
today we are going to be talking about
the assisted pull-up
what it's good for what it's not the
mistakes folks make on it and how to fix
them
real quick the assisted pull-up
its ideal role is not actually just to
let you get more reps of regular
pull-ups
that is a possibility where you could
use it
but for most folks because the assisted
pull-up
gives you a huge weight stack to work
with you can do
one better you can use it as a way
to train the back and vertical pulling
style similar to a pull-up
but with a much greater mind-muscle
connection and attention to specific
positioning and technique
that you could ever hope for with a
pull-up so a lot of the recommendations
we're going to have and a lot of sort of
the improper practices we're going to
refute are going to be specifically
in order to address hitting the back
with a huge mind muscle connection and
getting the most
out of the assisted pull-up that you can
not just using it
as another way to do vertical pulling
with the same forces and same
biomechanics
all right folks first mistake super huge
common mistake
is too low of a range of motion here we
want to make sure we maximize the range
of motion because we want the stretch
under tension
and want as much motor unit recruitment
all the way even
into ranges of motion that are
impossible for most people to hit
just on pure strength with pull-ups so
jared's going to get on this machine and
you might have to put some padding on
here or something like that i sure
i sure do right but i'm short jared is
an adult height
so he's going to be able to go all the
way down for the stretch at the bottom
and when he comes up he is going to go
all the way up to where his chest is
actually
over his hands giving him a huge peak
contraction
because he's doing a full range of
motion every single time he's making
sure to really do justice to his back
now
with regular pull-ups sometimes folks
aren't that strong
show us what a regular pull-up height
might look like for a regular person
they might just come up to there
you want to do a little bit differently
with an assisted pull-up you want to
reach the areas
that a regular pull-up can't so put a
little bit more weight on the stack to
help yourself
out get a super deep stretch and come
all the way up
every single time that's it
mistake number two is not milking out
the peak contraction not a hundred
percent required but really highly
recommended because this really isn't
something
you can do super well with regular
pull-ups and even if you use banded
pull-ups
the band doesn't help you much at the
top and again misses out on that
component
so for assisted pull-ups there's two
general types
of top peak contractions that we can do
the more lat focused one
is where you curl over a little bit at
the top pulling your elbows down
really targeting your lats jared go
ahead and show us that one so he's just
going to come up vertically
and you'll notice he's kind of tilted
forward that really hits your lats a lot
his back is very much up and down the
other one
hitting more of the back and possibly
more of the lower lats rather than
outer is where he's going to arch up
into it and push his chest
straight up and out either way you'll
notice he comes all the way back up and
takes at least like a second
to really squeeze at the top no matter
which way you do it both ways are fine
pick one do it for a few mesocycles go
back to the other one
do it for a few mesos what you don't
want to do is get to the top of an
assisted pull up and just kind of
and just come back down milk that peak
contraction because you can really only
get it
with an assisted pull-up interestingly
enough even pull-downs are usually
leveraged in such a way
you can just barely touch and if you
have to with a pull-down
focus on the p contraction you have to
reduce the weight so much
that on the eccentric phase and on the
bottom it really does almost nothing for
you
here's the exercise where you get the p
contraction either do the lat focused
one
or the entire rest of the back focused
one whichever one you find best stimulus
to fatigue ratio
give that one a shot
all right you guys probably knew i was
gonna say this because it's basically in
every single one of our videos
and it's in one of the core technique
guides controlling eccentric is huge but
here's the deal
when you're on a pull down for example
there's really so much you can control
the eccentric you can
but it really costs you a lot of reps
and sometimes even cost you a stimulus
to fatigue ratio
because you spend so much time
controlling eccentric you're not worried
about actually getting in good reps
with pull-ups it's possible for sure to
control eccentric and it's a good idea
but it limits your rep number so much a
lot that it's sometimes just tough to
put into practice you start controlling
the centrifuge you're down to sets of
three or four
and then what you're just doing pull up
power lifting for lack of a better term
assisted pull-ups are the place to focus
on
milking the living out of that
eccentric so we normally say
the eccentric phase can be like one to
three or four seconds long
here we really do prefer and recommend
to you that you try the three or four
second version so jared give us a shot
at what that looks like
jared's gonna go up at a normal pace
he's gonna do the peak contraction that
he likes
and then he's gonna slowly lower and
feel his lats ripping apart
full stretch notice how he pulls forward
at the bottom and all the way back down
nice and slow and controlled stretching
the lats
and then all the way back up beautiful
if you do them like this
i promise you if you push yourself
really hard you're gonna get excellent
results you're going to feel your lats
in ways you haven't really felt before
it's going to be worth it
next mistake two for one special because
these almost
always come hand in hand no standard
range of motion
all the reps look a little bit different
not a good thing we can't track we can't
program we can't know if we're
progressing
and two swinging and kipping and all
this other weird nonsense
here's the thing if you're a competitive
crossfitter a kipping pull-up is a
competition event and you should be
training it it's a great exercise
if you are in the gym trying to get
hypertrophy which is why the hell you're
watching these videos
that is not a good idea to do because
it's impossible to track it increases
your
risk of injury and all this other kind
of stuff you just don't want
so make sure you're meticulous with your
technique you're never cheating and a
lot of times the cheating happens when
people want more reps they do this like
whole body snake and it always
comes with an inconsistent range of
motion jared
show us how to do this wrong so jared
wants more reps
he's got to have it so he's got to do
the swing thing and yeah
and then can you do the chicken head at
the bottom where you try to like get the
get the good
yes yes you get it's all about getting
that chin over because god is watching
you do assistive pull downs
or pull-ups and he just doesn't count
the ones where he just didn't see your
chin clear the bar
if you can lie to god and not activate
your lats and get your chin going he's
like wow or from up here in heaven
it looks like you're doing a great job
it doesn't work like that so
all the way up and down every single
time full rom
standardized and here's the thing i'm
just going to say it plainly
if you have to cheat to get a rep on the
assisted pull-up
sit down get out a notepad and calmly
re-evaluate the
 rest of your life
all right folks kind of an interesting
quirk that some folks focus too much on
thus making it a mistake
is to try to turn an exercise that's
compound in nature
like the assisted pull-up into an
isolation exercise for the lats
you say hey we're training back and
people like lats you mean lats like no
the lats are just one part of the back
and there's other muscles and when
they're really big
it makes your back look really really
cool lat isolation exercises do exist
straight on pull downs for example and
they're super great and we'll cover them
later
but this is an exercise where it's okay
especially
if your scapulae elevate and depress as
needed to get you a full range of motion
because muscles make those movements
happen and they hypertrophy too
the traps do that stuff the rhomboid
that stuff tara's major and stuff is
involved
those are big muscles you want to have
in a big back
can you fix your scapulae completely
and still get a good value out of this
exercise yeah
but we honestly don't recommend it we
think that you should be going all the
way down and all the way up and letting
your scapula move naturally here's what
we mean jared
do the super anal
scapula can't move or else you're gonna
die thing
so like yeah that's cool
notice this scapulae aren't really
moving okay
sweet like mission accomplished i guess
your total force production is down your
total range of motion is down
maybe it's worth it probably not better
for lat exercise that's isolation now
jared do an actual assisted pull up and
you'll notice and do it nice and slow
the scapula elevate at the bottom
and they depress at the top they're
going to elevate at the bottom they
slide up and depress at the top that not
only does that stretch the lats out more
and give them more stimulus
it involves a bunch of other back
muscles as well that's all good news
two for one special again here we go
which grips should you use big fallacy
is thinking there's some one magical
grip that activates the lats the most
well there's different parts of the lats
different parts of the rest of your back
different joint designs different
designs of human being
some of the stuff you do for a while can
get stale so switching it up is totally
cool
there really are no wrong answers here
unless something is bothering your
joints or you can't produce pretty high
forces with it
that's it or you can you just don't feel
it in your back at all you feel it like
your rear delts or something like that
so what are the options jared we have
the regular grip right demonstrate that
boom that's totally cool jarrod can take
a wide grip just distal to that
that's totally fine he can take a
neutral grip which is right up there
boom or he can even sort of on this
device do an underhand grip maybe
yeah yeah why not yeah boom underhand
grip
right so use all the grips you want and
bonus round i'm gonna disappear off
screen for a second and come back with a
really really cool idea
voila i'm back so check this out look
what i brought
you can take one of the like chest fly
attachments from the cables
and rig it somehow safely to your
assisted pull-up
which gives you a little bit more free
motion and you might be able to put it
in some way that just gives you a better
mind muscle connection better stimulus
to fatigue ratio
it's some kind of magical thing like if
you're not using it's not working
and a lot of times you use it because
the machine's handles just suck
and we want to put handles in a better
place but it can extend extend your
range of motion
to some extent and it can make it more
comfortable so if you have a handle
situation in your assisted pull-up
machine
which just isn't working for you try one
of these and even the ones
that are made of uh the rope material
sometimes they're longer
that can totally work and it can
actually make a decent or crappy machine
something that's really useful and
really good now
this brings up a really good point
because check this out it independently
rotates
that sucks because then your forearms
are the only thing holding you back
which brings us to the conversation
about grip
your grip cannot be a limiting factor on
assisted pull-ups because then
your forearms are going one from fail or
to fail and what about your lats and
your other back muscles they could be
five or six reps from failure you would
just never know
remember anything much more or much
further from failure than like three
reps is just not very stimulative
it doesn't grow muscle really well it
generates a lot of fatigue for not a lot
of muscle growth it's a bad way to train
so we want to make sure we're not
running into that problem for the target
muscles of the back which means we have
to make sure our grip is not limiting
you know your grip is limiting when you
feel like your back has more oomph
but your hand starts to slip how do you
remediate that well there's three
potential things we can do
one is to use chalk chalk is great
it's not that amazing and sometimes your
gym people will yell at you because
for the love of god god forbid there's
chalk in a gym
that happens usually it's a good idea if
you have chalk use it next
is a regular standard strap straps are
great
but again they don't pay us to say this
but versa grips are the single greatest
invention mankind has ever produced
as a matter of fact if you're wondering
why there were lots of alien sightings
in the 1960s 70s and 80s but the aliens
never made contact with us
it's because they knew we had invented
versa grips yet it was pointless to talk
this is a ridiculous society now that
versa grips are around
you guys notice the us navy is catching
some some more uh
weird aircraft it's time the aliens are
gonna come down and welcome us into
intergalactic
stakeholders realm because we have versa
grips versa grips are unbelievable
try them if you don't have versa grip
pro is like i don't know it's like
thirty dollars it's the greatest
investment you'll ever make
it is physically impossible for you to
lose your grip i think your hand will
come off before that happens
tighten it up and you'll get the best
back training you've ever had
even if you don't have versa grip so if
you can't afford them no big deal just
make sure that the chalk or straps or
whatever you can
grip is not a limiting factor
all right folks last mistake last
correction
is using an inappropriate amount of load
for the machine
if your goal with this machine is to
increase the number of pull-ups you can
do
because you can do so few pull-ups that
you can't even put in rep work and
pull-ups
like if you're trying to get stronger on
pull-ups and you can't even do three to
six reps of pull-ups totally cool been
there done
that you can use this just as a regular
pull-up enhancer put a little bit of
weight on there get your sets of three
to six
and then you'll get stronger totally
fine no
no love lost however if you're using it
for pure hypertrophy purposes
usually you want at least sets of five
to ten
and often sets of five to ten is
something many people who are in
hypertrophy training can already do on
pull-ups
leave those for pull-ups ideally you
want sets of 10 to 20
unassisted pull-ups why because sets of
20 to 30
each rep takes so long it's gonna be
like two and a half minutes of actual
lifting
at that point the loading isn't high
enough to really stimulate as much
hypertrophy
and a lot of times your forearms have
such a huge pump even with versa grips
that there it's basically not a back
exercise anymore so
our recommendation is right around the
10 to 20 rep range for a first set
that's a really good rep range if it's a
little higher great if it's a little
lower grate just make sure the stimulus
to fatigue ratio is there
your back feels it a ton there's nothing
else holding you back and you're getting
great pumps
pumps i think are a pretty good way to
judge if an exercise especially like
this one
is doing its task if you do a set of
like six and you're kind of like oh that
was hard but i don't feel like anything
happened
eh if you do a set of 30 you're like i'm
just tired in my form sir
but if you do a set of like 15 to 20 and
all of a sudden you're like oh my god
i have a pump especially if you do a
couple more sets and you have a big pump
in your lats in your back
you're really really golden start in
that moderate range focus on quality
the assisted pull-up can take you miles
and miles and miles on the back
development
give it a shot let us know what you
think and in the comments
shoot us some other exercises you want
us to go over and maybe we'll get to
them and maybe just despite you
we'll never pick the one you asked for
