oh boy you ready i'm
ready but i will say that
my first bit of shit talking is just
that you enjoy this
way too much that's a knock on your
character
because i'm a mean person yeah right so
i might as well just keep rolling
uh your accomplishment is that you lost
a bunch of weight
wow red carpet folks amazing
gandhi mlk ethan fucking supply
yeah pretty much
next i mean are we just shooting these
off because i want to
get in line with those people and take
my appropriate place
at the top at the top yeah move over
gandhi
what the fuck did you ever do okay
um mike you may have your followers
tricked
but i know you're a morally bankrupt
corporate gmo
big pharma shill
[Music]
now that's fake
you know what's fake ethan hollywood's
fake
you're fake that's it
it's all a fucking lie and everyone
knows
yeah okay again that's
uh true you always say
training close to failure is good for
muscle growth but you usually leave
10 reps in the tank what's up with that
yeah well there are men and there are
gods
which is to say there are me and then
there are lyle mcdonald's
and i'm just not i'm just not tough
enough you know that you've trained with
me before
unrelated what is your favorite moon
juice flavor that your butler gets for
you
every day i don't know what mood
what does anyone else know what moon
juice is
moon juice is a preposterous
hollywood scam of a quote-unquote
restaurant it's like a juice place
okay and it's like exorbitantly
expensive
and the lady that owns it puts like 50
trillion different herbs in the shit and
they don't do anything it's like the
ultimate hollywood thing
i think that's my children like
something like that called creation with
a k
which always makes me feel a little
uncomfortable why has it got to be with
a k
something new something different the
kids just weren't paying attention to it
yeah i've had um i've had this
and i i do er on the side of heavy
um nuts nut butters
like a lot of nuts yeah i like a lot of
nuts
um you've used my bathroom at my house
and i've been in yours what's with all
the baby powder
jesus christ these motherfuckers told
you too much
tmi but you don't use baby powder
no fuck how are you so you're the
genetic elite let me explain something
real quick
when you get to a certain size and
you're not like gifted like yourself
your nether regions start rotting
and unless they are dried completely
all the time with baby powder copious
amounts
so i thought it was a fat people thing
all fat people knew
no back when you were like 5 30 you
weren't using baby powder
no that's you honestly like god blessed
you
yeah i i know that's true
why don't you ever pay attention to your
training partner
jared's technique and just do better
hashtag do better
jared is a cocksucker and he lies a lot
all these things he told you to say were
fucking lies
i do want to say that charlie
in the text train where it was me
charlie and jared
charlie was mostly just laughing yeah
and jared had a lot to say huh
jared had a lot to say charlie
did did say that the baby powder was an
issue
baby powder is definitely an issue um as
far as hollywood
status is concerned what do you like
d-list e-list celebrity
f-list yeah f list means something else
i think in the industry
it does but it's a lot of fun
[Laughter]
damn it that was supposed to be my big
insult
um you should probably see a
psychiatrist about your newly found
addiction to
step tracking kind of weird man
these are all like things jared hates
about me and he's venting through you
he he i said i need stuff because i'm
generally not a mean-spirited person who
thinks critically of others i'm
tend to just go like i like that guy
yeah
you're the kind of person that likes to
compliment themselves in public by
saying you're not mean-spirited yes
jared had a lot to say to me jared's a
mean guy it had a lot to say
um i never liked remember the titans
just for the record
uh what's his name uh earl
never heard of him
[Laughter]
why do you hate fat people so much
this could go very poorly if released
out of context
that's really good mine is related um
did you gain weight recently because you
really look like you gained a lot of
weight
it's terrible that was my last one okay
wait i have one more
um the entire internet
is waiting for this we need you
to nut up or shut up
lyle mcdonald 2021 that's right
well it's not going to happen internet
because i'm a pussy
[Laughter]
all right we fucking did that it wasn't
so horrible i was a little scared no um
i will say that i think mr mcdonald
doesn't quite understand the difference
between objective and subjective
i think he thinks objective is whatever
he perceives
definitely he also has a couple of other
illusions one
a repetition speed is not as closely
linked to failure proximity as he would
like to believe
many people have a repetition that's
their last completed one
before their technique goes to hell they
can't lift that looks almost as fast as
their
last as their attempt uh some people
just grind to halt
some people's first rep in a set of 10
looks like a grinder and then you just
get 10.
so his heuristic of using repetition
speed to predict failure is
false right out of the gate secondly
he doesn't seem to understand the
difference in technical failure and
absolute failure absolute is like when
you just do whatever it takes to lift
the weight up which is seemingly what
he's doing technical failure is if your
next rep
is going to have to be bad technique to
get
then you stop so yeah so a lot of times
everything looks fine
and you stop and people like what are
you doing or like the next one would
have been dog shit
and even because we're really sticklers
on technique
we have to make sure that we stop before
things go to hell because here's the
funny thing right
lyle gives me shit on youtube for um
not going close enough to failure if i
did that extra wrap and my technique
went a little bit how many people you
think give me shit for uh oh look
the last rip looked like shit dr mike i
thought you were mr technique so right
that that that is
listen i i don't know that i know nearly
as much as even mr mcdonald knows about
this kind of nobody really does
no i certainly don't know as much as you
the way i gauge failure this has been my
overreach week
the way i engage failure that's why you
weigh 280 motherfuckers
yeah if if i can't do another perfect
rep yeah that's how you're supposed to
yeah i'm doing bench press
by myself in a gym i don't what do i
if i can't get it up i'm just then the
guy in the gym with the fucking thing on
my
chest i can tell when it's done
being a perfect rep for sure and it may
look just fine
yeah this is something only insane
people arguing luckily lyle
overqualifies for that one yes ethan are
you ready
for yes let me tell richard great
interview
