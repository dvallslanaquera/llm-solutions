hey folks dr mike here
this video is a bit different than what
we usually do on this channel but i
promise you'll learn
maybe something
justin bieber's steroid cycle
what i think he might be taking
granted that i know a few insider things
about this young man justin bieber who
is he the man the myth the legend he's a
singer he's a songwriter he's a
performer and you know what folks he's
an icon
but what's really the standout a lot of
folks have been this michael jackson
paul mccartney the list goes on
justin bieber's standout is his physique
look at that rippling body holy crap
what is he doing
to get on that hollywood level now
this video is all about how i think he
might be engineering his physique to
look like this specifically from a
pharmacological perspective
it's just my views it's for
entertainment only
it's not what he's for sure running it's
what i think he might be running
and
let's be honest
looking like him it just doesn't come
naturally know he's on something and i
have
i think a really good idea so let's just
cut to the chase
we're gonna look at the cycle real quick
flashing on the screen for you
and then we'll break things down so
looking like a 24 week cycle maybe ends
in a big music festival where he's the
headliner performer gotta be in your
tip-top shape for that
and it looks like we got a base of 500
migs per week of test and anthony smart
choice justin good idea runs the base
all the way through small critique it
could have curtailed that test towards
the end to get a bit of a drier look but
like we're really picking at uh tiny
little details here
primo starts at 500 per week and goes up
to a thousand hey that's a meat and
potatoes dose of premo justin is gonna
be getting a bit
bigger
you see what i did there
master on starts at 500 migs at week
nine smart don't hit yourself all in the
face with all that stuff at once
goes up to 1500 migs total per week by
week 24. gee whiz you know that's going
to be a dry physique folks good god
of course anyone who's ever tried to
look even a little bit better knows that
tren is this the lord of the rings ring
the unite them all of that whole
equation
starts out at a solid whap to the face
500 migs of trend per week and works up
to 1500 migs good news is rockstars
don't sleep and 1500 makes a trend means
you won't sleep and you might go insane
but rockstar is already insane it's like
the cycle was tailor made for his exact
lifestyle
winstrol we need that dryness folks
when you're on the stage
playing the guitar i'm not sure i've
ever heard justin bieber's music
whatever it is how he makes his sounds
ostensibly with his mouth i assume
uh you know he got you got to be dry
because if people look at you and your
water it's just not going to work out
winstrol brings the dryness 50 migs a
day to start nice and easy and week 17
week 24 100 megs a day look on the one
side
the old family liver has taken one to
the dick on that one on the plus side
you're dry as hell
nowadays folks of justin bieber's age i
don't even know if they drink i think
they do like xanax and stuff like that
so you know the liver at least doesn't
have to compete with rife alcoholism
of course
winstrol gets you dry but it doesn't
have that combo of dry and full and it
doesn't get you much meaner we know that
rock performers have to get fucking wild
on that stage nothing makes you wild
like a few migs of halo so halo testing
introduced four weeks out week 21 to 24.
that last week's 100 rigs of halo again
no sleep at that point and no need for
sleep because you're either dead or an
ascended god and i'm pretty sure we know
which one justin bieber is now all that
stuff is havoc on the body and also we
want to be really lean at the end of
this joint health etc longevity we could
even say that's where the growth hormone
comes in gh and you know justin only
gets the pharma finest starts at five
u's and then once and we'll talk about
this in a sec the cutting phase starts
the first half of this is a massing
phase second half is a cutting phase
five i use goes to ten i use when you
start cutting because look well this is
this is a top tier guy it's not to be
messing around with two or three we're
not we're not at a health clinic here
with justin bieber's rock concert we're
doing things for real 10 i use all the
way through
it helps a little with the sleep to be
honest 1500 megs of trend 100 megs of
halo the growth is a small drop in a
large pond
insulin
you don't mess with that insulin
everyone knows this so 20 i use all the
way up to 30 ius at week 12 when mass
peaks no insulin for the cut
30 i use again mild critique while i'm
reading this i have some more and a few
yeah it was just not like
it's not as much of a business amount of
sling as i would have expected this
guy's doing 50 to 100. biebs you're
better than this you could do more slim
now calories he runs a 500 calorie per
day surplus for the first 12 weeks 500
deficit for the last 12 weeks which
makes him pretty hungry coming into that
contest hungry to make a crowd pleased
via his beautiful music and actually i
take that back because with that much
winstrol and halo
and tran the way it affects most
people's hunger probably hunger is not
an emotion you'll be experiencing now
that i think of it with that much gear
you might not be experiencing human
emotions anymore which again if you're a
famous rock star you've got to have your
fill of those too many human emotions
you want to become a bit more like a
machine creatine ultra important nobody
does this shit without creatine five
grams every day in the morning
you can even dry scoop it i approve of
that message and
if you're serious and you're in
hollywood and you're a rock star you
need to be hydrated jumping around on
the stage doing practice concerts
lifting weights with your coach
that requires hydration and everyone
knows coconut water is the ultimate
hydrating beverage and is consumed intra
workout for every single week of this
prep
all right let's break this down what do
we think about this cycle
couple of critiques some might say where
is the thyroid support you're on trend
for that long especially into a low
calorie phase your thyroid may not work
anymore well yeah valid where is it i
don't know somebody has to talk to beabs
about what the hell he's doing with his
life i would recommend thyroid support
t4 t3 combo running into the peak
i guess he could give a fuck works for
him it works for me another thing people
could say is while 5
300 milligrams per week at the top end
is a lot of gear uh yeah so it is
but do you mr critic have a hollywood
body what's that you don't
exactly
now
other folks might say
isn't this kind of like the cycle of
what a 300 pound top tier olympia
caliber bodybuilder would run
yes but
measured by instagram followers you know
when they olympia got one one to five
million i mean five is the extreme a few
mil
how many ig followers does biebs have
yeah
hundreds of millions sounds like an
appropriate cycle for me as a matter of
fact ratioed to his instagram followers
he's running the bare minimum for his
instagram following this dose of gear is
like
low-level trt the kind of shit that when
you go to your doctor you get a trt
script and he's like oh here's 50 migs
of tests every two weeks you're like
what the fuck
i'm gonna die on this this is crazy it's
not enough it's at the very least not
enough that's the real critique
now
a little truth for you guys because you
are sheeple and you need to wake up
everyone every single person in
hollywood that's right in the actual
city vicinity is on grams of shit how do
you think you get a body like justin
bieber's oh healthy food fuck up out of
here yeah sure some food is involved but
it's just
90 something percent drugs
now
some might say real dastardly critics
that justin's
body is kind of more clear evidence of a
guy that barely works out never mind
takes gear
a valid point for the uneducated like
yourself if you're making that point
frankly you don't know what you're
talking about i'm an expert i got all
sorts of phds and shit like that i look
at his body and i see
a kitchen sink of pharmacological
irresponsibility or leveraged instagram
followers kind of underdosing to be
completely honest
your old heroes are dead this is not
your mom and dad's america technically i
think justin bieber's canadian which
makes my points even stronger
fame isn't earned or cultivated fame is
injected and if you don't agree with me
that's okay hey i've been wrong about
stuff before and now you're wrong about
it
now that's it for justin bieber next
time let me know in the comments who
else you guys want me to profile and
make a pretend cycle for i mean
what i think they're taking
and i'm gonna make up a bunch of
baseless claims
about real human beings but it's all
gonna be fun because hey this is youtube
land right so we're all having a good
time
and uh by the way in case you're upset
or viscerally react to this this whole
video has been a joke i suppose if
that's not clear to you you have a whole
lot of other things in life to figure
out and uh for the love of god please
don't take any of the shit i listed um
and if you're in a country in which this
type of stuff is legal only do it under
the supervision of two people an
experienced coach and a medical doctor
otherwise
peace i'm going on the beep cycle baby
you
