another one shimmy
we're here to work
put your feet down and work big chunks
big chest big chest chest one more last
one
[Music]
yo
dr mike israel that's me that's why i'm
pointing to myself jared feather that's
why i'm pointing at him ifbb pro
shimmy
hacker what the hell kind of a name is
that you got a hebrew name don't you yes
shimon that's right
from the bible right
so with the torah the talmud same thing
anyway yeah
shimmy is clearly jewish but that's not
why we're filming this video
we're filming this video because shimmy
has to train back and based on his
cheekbones motherfucker lean as hell can
we swear yet or not i sure hope youtube
doesn't flag that anyway i said it
pretty fast maybe the algorithm will
pick it up
back but it's horizontal emphasis back
so we have two arm dumbbell rows
we got the prime row machine which is
the greatest row machine ever made prime
you're the shiznit to quote uh little
nicky it's jared thinks it's decent
prime jared doesn't think you're
equipping amazing just pretty good good
equipment and uh after that we are going
to be doing lat prayers
you're used to praying since you're
jewish yes i assume excellent and i've
probably canceled myself and rp off
youtube by now let's get to the two-arm
dumbbell rows and have some fun
all right folks exercise number one
multiple sets of two arm bent over
dumbbell rows it's basically like a
barbell row in every salient way except
you're holding two dumbbells and
it's just variation okay if you have to
ask the question of how is this superior
to a barbell row you're already asking
the wrong question that's like saying
how is pasta superior to rice
it's just another choice it works really
well
and i'm sure in the comments we'll hear
some people trying to objectively make
pasta spirited rice i'm i'm there for
that conversation pasta's amazing right
jared do you like pasta rice better holy
shit probably rice
fuck you yeah i know always have a
debate right now
multiple sets of
shimmy how many reps
10 to 15 reps
with one mile rep
break during rose interesting shimmy's
in charge let's get it done
you got a nice caboose shimmy if god did
this exercise his technique would be
worse than yours
sorry to make you laugh that's a warm-up
yeah or would you oh
well we're just getting started
what shimmy just did was his working
weight is going to be 80 pounds and he
just did a set of like two to four reps
with the 80s fly in sports science we
call that a potentiation set it is part
of the warm-up process it's the last set
of the warmer you use a weight that's
close to at or even just above your
working weight so for example if you're
benching like 100 pounds you might go to
110 or two or four reps or maybe 100 or
even just 90. what that does is you're
already warm technically your tissues
are pliable or your joints and
everything are good you could skip that
and be totally safe and fine however
that said with just two to four reps of
what his is probably his 15 to 20 rm
it's not a huge uh contributor to
fatigue basically not at all
however
it gets your nervous system and your
psychology used to handling that heavy
weight that first set you do after you
can add
man three to five high quality reps at
the tail end just by doing a
potentiation set so you're super
prepared to take that heavy weight
because if you like let's say you're
hacked one you're working up to 400
pounds if your last warm-up was 315 for
like eight you go straight to 405 as
your working weight man it feels
different it feels kind of like it's
crushing you in the first few
reps of that working set are going to
kind of be exploratory reps it's a good
idea to get those out of the way it also
reduces injury risk so what you want to
do is get the weight on your back or in
your hands that you're going to do for
working weight even a little more
sometimes is a good idea then you will
be neurologically and technically
prepared for the heavy weight i promise
your working sets are going to feel
better look at those pecs
let's go
good setup
[Music]
good technique only shimmy
your chest at the bottom
back only no butts you guys will notice
that
shimmy
picks the weight up completely
and then does a full stiff-legged
deadlift style hip hinge
does the rose hip hinges back out and
then stops the alternative of course is
to pick the weights up off the ground
and then just row what are the costs and
benefits the downside of the hip hinge
from the top is that it takes some
energy to do
the upside is that for some folks and a
lot of times myself included
if you start rolling from the bottom
everyone reaches down they tend to round
their back to some extent sometimes
proprioceptively feeling out your back
trying to arch your back from the bottom
is fucking hard you're like i don't know
where my back is in space if you start
here you can get a nice hip hinge and
get into a really good position bonus
points it hits your hamstrings and boots
a little bit which you know people like
a big back when their hands is popping
glutes like this if you like a boy girl
whatever all you got to do is come up to
him be like
down set
50
higher reps bit more pump
cool thing about down sets is
it's so difficult to keep your technique
straight with heavy weight
that you get really aware my muscle
connection gets really high during those
heavy weights because you really have to
try when you go to a down set or two or
three
your technique and my muscle connection
can be super stellar because once you
have the light weight in your hands holy
shit it's now so much easier to focus on
it again
just something for you to try let's get
it done
great way to protract or step back keep
that back tight there you go
two more
one more let's go
good rest it out
let's do it
big chest
let's get three
chest up chest up chest up
yes yeah
awesome
[Music]
noise
lazy asshole you just did the same
fucking no you're lazy well i guess
mine's less meat
lazier asshole
[Music]
let's prime it
[Music]
so
the prime
row is a incredible machine
there are ways to get different things
out of the machine
if you put weight on the bottom peg
which is interestingly enough labeled
number two
you get pretty uh even force curve the
entire thing is roughly the same
peg number one it biases a little bit
towards making the bottom heavier and
the top lighter
which is more like the force curve
anyway that you want from a hypertrophic
optimization standpoint and matches your
natural force grip anyway
the top peg i consider the money peg
that's the one if you put most of the
weight on the top peg makes the top
really easy and lets you really arch and
really retract me squeeze the fuck out
of everything up there which is awesome
and then it makes the weight super heavy
at the bottom stretch under tension big
contributed hypertrophy i put the
preponderance of the weight at the top
maybe a little bit in the middle i don't
really use that bottom peg too often uh
i am not a licensed distributor of prime
equipment nor do i speak for them but
that's my professional opinion
jared feather certainly has thoughts
that are probably antagonistic let's
hear from him next
what i think about prime what do you
think about this roll machine you stupid
motherfucker i mean it's fine
i don't think you need the bottom peg at
all it's just completely ridiculous
[Music]
[Laughter]
that's the real shit
we can always count on jerry for no
political correctness
good
a little faster on the way down
a little pulley forward bigger stretch
to the bottom
yes
yes there it is
good slow it down towards the top so
it's a gentle touch and then a hold big
stretch
gentle touch beautiful right there now
we're in the fucking money
so check this out question about rose
barbell and dumbo rose should you pause
at the top
maybe that's a cool variation to do but
it has a downside
a lot of the hypertrophic stimulus
especially from rose
comes from the heavy weight pulling your
shit apart at the very bottom stretch
with tension
if you want to successfully pause the
weight at the top for one or two seconds
it's either going to reduce the load you
can do for any given number of reps
or you just get fewer reps
so the downside is you may get less
overall stimulus if you do the pauses
maybe it's a cool variation to try but
ideally what you want to do is save the
top pausing stuff for machines
specifically machines leveraged to make
the top paws easier and the bottom
really hard so you don't have to
sacrifice that bottom stretch to get the
really good top polish
fuck yeah
a little stretch full stretch there you
go
two more oh yeah
one more
make sure the chest is bigger
big chest let's go
there you go
i would say that probably 99 of guys
just kind of want to look like that
you guys seen thor and shit in the

want a compilation yeah me too doing
shit like like this
oh yeah
ah like yelling and shit
life goal
maybe some words
at least recognize that we're out there
man we love your shit come on
[Music]
if you pray for your gains will that
work maybe maybe not but a few lap
prayers view gates for sure
also called a straight arm pull down
which is an interesting term so here we
want a few things
we want a super big stretch at the top
because while we're stretching our
muscles under a high degree of tension
they grow a ton this is also one of the
only exercises that really allows you to
stretch the shit out of the lat and have
tension out at the same time we're going
to come down gently touch or go even
outside if we have the right attachment
all the way back you can do a little bit
of coming forward here and then really
reaching down keeping your chest up but
leaning in so you get a maximum tension
up here and then come all the way back
down always under control sets of 10 to
20 reps
this is going to finish off jimmy's back
workout he's going to do some biceps and
shoulders on his own youtube we're not
interested in seeing that shit jk
that'll be in another video let's get it
