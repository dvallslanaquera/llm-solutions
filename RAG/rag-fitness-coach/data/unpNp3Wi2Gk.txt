I was like damn he's really doing this
that was awesome
[Music]
yo what up folks Dr Mike here for
Renaissance periodization you guys know
I have a pretty big Channel I'm sort of
important that thing is like I wasn't
always like that I had a little tiny
Channel coming up we're always trying to
give love to the guys coming up in their
own little way and it's my friend Jeff
nippard he's trying to get a YouTube
following going so I brought him on the
channel
and if you guys want to give him some
love it's Jeff Nipper just YouTube it
he'll come up doesn't have a ton of
followers yet he's a really great guy
lifetime drug free lifter and just a
good person you know thank you and he
trains in Canada the great white North
and we chatted about this just before we
got started filming but he would like to
introduce this video by singing the
Canadian national anthem in its entirety
Jeff hit it you started off I'll I'll do
the second verse yes absolutely what
does it start what's the first word Oh
Canada
and that's good enough let's do chest
and triceps let's go
[Music]
exercise number one is going to be the
Atlantis incline machine press you guys
have seen it before on our Channel
uh it's just dope it's awesome the
Atlantis people knocked it out of the
parkway to do almost everything we are
going to be doing sets of oh silver team
10 to 15 8 and 15 repetitions you're
going to look for that slow eccentric
control
deep pause with the chest lifted up and
then a nice athletic return to full
range of motion let's go let's get to it
oh you don't have to do this crap
you say you say I do oh geez okay well
I like to make sure folks warm up
exactly as they want okay God damn it
Jeff
very well we'll do the patented Dr Mike
pretend stiff legged deadlift and you
have to do the T-Rex arms how many
warm-up sets are we doing so I generally
like to do about three okay
and they're just getting incrementally
heavier and then I do first working set
how many working sets probably three or
four working sets so three or four
warm-up sets three four working sets
correct okay that sounds great yeah
yes again
slow control
hit it stop go go God damn you now slow
as if you're gonna do another one slow
slow
pause wait unload
nice yeah that was really good man man I
tend to find that that last rep if you
just dump it like it's totally cool yeah
but if you fucking let it go it's like
when your muscles are closest to failure
that last decade oh my God it's like
that X yeah
[Music]
let's go Mike
[Music]
oh wow
Yahoo right strong human being
good slow
these are flawless dude again
perfect big chest
go go go I got one more that's it let's
do it
slow and control big pause up move it
just move it just and then as if another
raise your chest go slow
take a solid boss at the bottom unload
come on dude yeah I should have screw on
that one
that was awesome
you know what I just noticed the uh the
big chest cue when I do that
you really feel the stretch 100 right
yeah I was like huh I was like Mike's
doing a power lifting thing with the uh
get their arch up you know I was like oh
wait a minute
yes it feels much slower than what I'm
used to I'll say that
which I don't mind at all because it'll
allow me to train a little bit lighter
and protect the old joints sure sure I
can punish the muscles at least pain
wise even more by going slower and
simultaneously reduce injury risk like
kind of think like we're winning on also
for sure for sure and well with you I
mean you don't have many more rocks left
to unturn with this machine here right
so you know you have to do something to
keep it challenging for you I am going
to I was at 240 I hit eight and then six
I'm gonna do down sets which my uh app
has just been updated to do so whenever
you can buy it watching this video it
will do that down sets and I'm gonna go
to 180 and uh hit that for another
probably two sets and then that'll be a
good start and we'll go to do some uh
tricep stuff crushing of the skull
perhaps oh Jeff
[Music]
hey
[Music]
yes sir
let's go
[Music]
good job
thank you so much Jeff
oh yeah
okay so I went one plate later
yes so I should be able to get something
in the range of 11 maybe 12 with this
big chest
great keep going
slow slow slow
[Music]
yes
slow and controlled
Big Stretch
Ed
one more
good moves Jeff
okay
I was like damn he's really doing this
that was awesome okay I really did try
everywhere there's nothing worse than
really really really trying yes and then
people saying but you didn't really
really really really try yeah
on YouTube five step time
hello
what's up man all right
we can learn we can learn
[Music]
I don't know if you've seen this before
oh they have a thingy oh this is so
beautiful
now you gotta come back guys uh Italian
yes
I have only ever done Smith machine
Skull Crushers once
life so I might need some guidance on
these soon it will be twice
how is the biomechanics looking here
it's looking like biomechanics get them
get them in a little bit more at the
bottom so don't let them flare yes there
you go sorry all right all right
I love the Smith machine spot pressure I
like freeway spot Crushers also but I
gotta say this for panata but not
the Smith machine here is like
unbelievable and uh also it's very
generous to strength because it's an
unloaded Smith which means the bar
weighs nothing and uh gee whiz
I'm gonna be star crushing a lot and
then it's Jeff's first time doing this
movement in a long time so I'm gonna be
working on some technique cues and tips
let's get after it
like that is mind-boggling tricep
strengths thank you so much WoW see I
respect that man like I like it when uh
big guys are also strong as opposed to
me well
some of the guys are like how the fuck
did you get that big being a fucking
bitch yeah I mean they're probably
strong if they
um knew how to use their body better
perhaps sure but like like the potential
is there it's just not realized but in
your case it's obviously well I was like
a mediocre drug free Power lifter before
so I do know how to like yeah yeah yeah
put my body in a decent place
move it go yes two more
slow and controlled
big moves
one more Jeff you got this
ease it up
yes I got it I got it yes
yes
I'm gonna do uh two down sets here at
135 and then we'll do a 95 for you okay
all right yeah sounds good
very nice
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
very nice
I'm trying to decide if I want to like
if I want to JM press it almost or
you're really skull crushing it right
like viewers Choice yeah so yeah so real
fun fact the JM it's a skull crusher is
a spectrum it's not one lift or another
okay it's close grip JM skull crusher to
the face skull crusher behind the neck
all right it's all a spectrum okay
there's no wrong answers it's just
whatever because your joints feeling
okay and you have a real good connection
with your triceps okay I'll tell you
what I feel I feel like I have a good I
have a good connection with my tricep
but I feel I feel a tendon stretch in a
way it doesn't hurt but I'm just saying
good yeah okay two more no more elbows
in
I got more good
way to control it awesome
[Music]
slow
up

slow slow slow slow
[Music]
go go I'm not helping okay
dude my man no shot I'm getting in the
middle of these two guys
no shot
it's the most Multicultural I've ever
seen yeah
Jeff one last one
yes
[Music]
last exercise of the day
the prime chest press it's adjustable as
all prime machines are to various biases
of loading from the deep stretch all the
way to the contraction
well we are scientifically literate
people so we are going to go with a deep
stretch bias here and we're going to
take a closer grip to kind of do both
chest and triceps because we did chest
first then triceps now it's a bit of
both this Prime press I've actually
never used it before it's my first time
it's like sex is being had with my chest
and triceps totally with not against my
will and it's amazing and I love it I
think I'm in love like if I woke up next
to the prime machine the next day and it
was like looking at me I would look back
into its eyes and be like I think this
is a thing power couple
so this is fucking sweet and we're gonna
do sets of
probably 10 to 15 uh 15 to 20 reps
something like that and I still burn
you ready
go
slow
oh come on go no no no no
let's wait for the next set yeah yeah
man just with those pauses it just it
makes it so much harder yeah
Jeff I gotta say your triceps are
unbelievably impressive oh thank you
thank you I kind of don't know what to
do with myself when I'm around them
[Music]
thank you
seven let's go Mike let's push it come
on
let's go come on
I'm with you if you want another one
yeah I know I feel that it's because
it's because of the the stretch yeah
yeah thing yes right at the bottom oh
okay give me two seconds let's do it
whatever you need whatever you need
hello
these are beautiful
two more elbows in
go go one more
[Music]
oh shit yes
okay come to me push push push and then
as if another slow chest up
big pause all the way down all the way
down and pause Big Stretch that's it
that was a good set
come on Mike
[Music]
one more let me help you get this one
control control pause
good
very nice oh thank you Jeff very very
nice
I think we should do one more fun
something fun me up
[Music]
so I think I personally think this will
be a nice finisher for the triceps
um we're really overhead whereas with
the skull crusher we were still a little
bit more more of a neutral position so
have you ever used this before Mike
oh machines like him but not this one
this exact one well it has a
my favorite he knows what I like
and then it's just an overhead extension
but it it's quite smooth so we can do
maybe one set here right just yeah great
yeah just once
one set pretty hard but yeah yeah okay
[Music]
[Music]
looking good there you go
[Music]
want me to help nope
[Music]
okay maybe help yes
all right I'm done I'm done I got like
