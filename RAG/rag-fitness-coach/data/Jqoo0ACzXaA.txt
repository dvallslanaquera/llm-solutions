my name is Linda barber I am a CrossFit
Games athlete this year 2018 will be my
fifth time at the CrossFit Games I've
been twice as an individual and this
will be my third time with closet mayhem
freedom I've been doing RP for five
years now and I have absolutely loved
every minute of it
[Music]
I did a whole bunch of different kind of
nutrition plans before I started doing
our Pete and then RP has been the one
that has worked the best for me and has
stuck I love that RP is pre-planned
every day based off of the type of
training schedule that you have it's one
less thing that I have to worry about
each day they've been very helpful to me
throughout my training increasing and
decreasing food based off of what my
specific fitness goals are day in and
day out
