many bodybuilders have advocated using
the mind muscle connection for
maximizing muscle growth
the mind muscle connection for those who
don't know is aiming to consciously
squeeze and maximally activate a
particular muscle during an exercise
can using this technique help you build
more muscle
there are two direct papers we can use
to help us answer this question
this first study by counts and
colleagues technically did not aim to
determine if the mind muscle connection
helped build more muscle
rather it gives us an insight into
whether squeezing
and maximally contracting a muscle
produces hypertrophy
which is the basis of the mind muscle
connection
13 untrained individuals had one arm
assigned to a no-load condition
and their other arm assigned to a high
load condition
participants trained both arms three
times per week for six weeks
with the arm that was assigned to the
no-load condition they performed a
biceps curl with no actual weight
they aim to squeeze and maximally
contract the biceps throughout the
curling movement
they did this for 4 sets of 20 reps with
30 seconds of rest between
sets with the opposite arm assigned to
the high load condition
they performed a dumbbell biceps curl
with seventy percent of their one rep
max
they did this for four sets of eight to
twelve reps with 90 seconds of rest
between sets
thickness of the biceps was measured at
three regions
roughly fifty percent sixty percent
and seventy percent of the upper arm
length
at all three regions of the biceps
increases in thickness were similar
between the two conditions
in other words bicep curls with no load
but trying to squeeze and maximally
activate the biceps throughout the
curling motion
resulted in similar gains to regular
dumbbell curls
which is extremely interesting
again this study didn't explicitly test
the mind muscle connection
but what this study does suggest is that
squeezing and aiming to maximally
activate a muscle
which is the basis of the mind muscle
connection can result in significant
growth
the question now becomes whether aiming
to do this during a loaded exercise
can help build more muscle this is where
the second paper by schoenfeld and
colleagues comes in
27 untrained men were split into an
internal focus group
or an external focus group both groups
train the standing biceps curl
and leg extension for four sets of eight
to twelve reps
with each set taken to failure three
times per week for 10 weeks
the internal focus group on each rep
was told to focus on squeezing the
targeted muscle
this was the biceps for the standing
biceps curl and the quadriceps for the
leg extension
the external focus group was told to
focus on getting the way up
on each rep for both exercises
thickness of the elbow flexors which
would have included the biceps bracha
and brachialis
rectus femoris and vastus lateralis
were measured before and after the 10
weeks of both groups
the internal focus group experienced
significantly greater increases in elbow
flexor thickness compared to the
external focus group
but increases in thickness for the
rectus femoris and vastus lateralis
was similar between both groups so
the mind muscle connection did seem to
help build more muscle for the elbow
flexors
but not for the quadriceps this is
intriguing
why might the mind muscle connection not
benefit the quads
the researchers noted that several
participants found it easier to focus on
the biceps
compared to the quadriceps in normal
life
the upper body is typically involved in
finer motor tasks
like writing whereas the lower body is
primarily involved in larger tasks
like walking this could explain why
individuals are better able to control
and activate their biceps
but not their quadriceps remember
the participants in this study were
untrained with training experience
developing a mind muscle connection with
the quadriceps may be possible
this in turn may be able to result in
greater growth
of course i am just guessing and future
research would be required to validate
this idea
so from the count study but mainly the
schoenfeld study
there is evidence that the mind muscle
connection can help build more muscle
but it's also important to consider the
context of these studies
both studies use single joint exercises
single joint exercises may be the most
practical and easiest type of movement
to apply the mind muscle connection
to the mind muscle connection could
still work with multi-joint exercises
but probably with the use of lighter
loads
a paper by kala tuya and colleagues
demonstrates this
they found that focusing on the chest
during bench pressures with 20 percent
40 percent and 60 percent warning max
did increase
chest electrical activity measured by
electromyography
compared to not using the mind muscle
connection this same logic
also applied to focusing on the triceps
but when subjects used eighty percent
one rep max on the bench press
the mind muscle connection did not
increase electrical activity for either
the chest or triceps
electromyography does come with its
limitations and inferring long-term
adaptations from emg data can be
problematic
but regardless i feel this study is
useful as the results are logical and
probably quite intuitive
when using heavy loads it would simply
be more difficult to focus on a
particular muscle
as much of your attention would be
directed towards just moving the load
[Music]
but with lighter loads it would be much
easier to direct your attention to a
particular muscle
another important thing worth mentioning
here is that given lighter loads are
likely better for using the mind muscle
connection
strength development will likely be less
although many people of course want to
build substantial muscle
many people do as well want to get
strong on some exercises
mainly multi-joint exercises for example
having a strong bench press squat or
deadlift
is a goal for many people if this
applies to you
for the most part it's probably best to
avoid using the mind muscle connection
on any movements you want to maximize
strength with
and rather just focus on using
relatively heavy loads
to conclude with single joint upper body
exercises
such as bicep curls there is direct
evidence that using the mind muscle
connection can help build more muscle
with single joint lower body exercises
you may wish to try and develop a mind
muscle connection with your lower body
this may help build more muscle with the
upper and lower body multi-joint
exercises
the mind muscle connection could work
with lighter loads so you may wish to
experiment with this
