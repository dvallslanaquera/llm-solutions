hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i'm gonna ask you a
question and then i'm gonna try to
answer it
why
does dieting get so much harder when
you're leaner
i don't think i have all the answers but
i have a few insights some of which you
certainly have heard and some of which
you may not have heard and not have
considered
because here's the thing dieting can be
hard and oftentimes is
but we've also made the observation even
personally for ourselves and reading the
literature and things like that and
talking to other people that
if you're starting out at a much higher
body fat a lot of times dieting to a
slightly lower body fat just is not that
tough
but if you're starting out pretty lean
it can be real tough and all the way
down to brutal
and generally speaking the leaner you
get
the harder dieting gets and it's not
like linear
like you're a little bit leaner dieting
gets a little bit harder it's
unfortunately a bit more like
exponential
you get quite a bit leaner and dieting
gets a lot harder and you get leaner
still and it gets a lot lot harder why
why is there not a linearity there or a
constancy
why is there an exponential relationship
we have at least five pretty decent
reasons and i'm sure there are more
first
and this is one of those kind of clever
ones that a lot of people don't think of
and they sort of think they're looking
at something objectively but really they
fail to consider something that is
ever-present or common
when you're leaner
you make the observation that it's
harder to diet but when you're leaner
for any given person that you see that's
pretty lean that probably means that
you've been dieting for a while already
and thus what you're asking isn't
is it harder to diet when i'm already
lean you're asking that question but you
forgot that we layered a ton of diet
fatigue that already took us to get that
lean
a lot of times people say when you have
a really low body fat level your energy
levels are down blah blah blah all from
low body fat and that's actually largely
untrue
if you're like an endurance runner and a
lot of these folks literally dexa test
at five to six percent body fat that's
like damn near competitive bodybuilders
a lot of fact local shows a lot of times
the leanest person on stage
are
people who are endurance runners having
problem with brain fog and energy and
hunger fuck no they're just normal as a
matter of fact they're ultra performers
they don't feel like you do when you've
taken three or four months to diet to
six percent because they live at six
percent and because they live there it
actually the leanness isn't what's
really that problem it's the cumulative
fatigue that you brought to get to that
leanness
that is really what is making it tough
so that's the first point is when we
think about how hard is it to diet when
you're lean we actually think it's
harder than it really is although it's
still harder because we bring in a lot
of diet fatigue and think that's part of
it but if you bring in a ton of diet
fatigue you take a maintenance phase you
stay at six percent three months later
you try to diet to you know five or four
percent yeah it's still gonna be super
tough but not as tough as if you try to
keep going i think a lot of times people
forget that
second point
the leaner you become generally speaking
and of course the longer you diet etc
the larger and more extreme hormone
deviations become from normal for
example your leptin tends to decrease
and leptin is an unbelievable satiety
hormone so if your leptin is high
then
you really don't feel like eating like
at a very deep level you're like food
man but if your leptin is low you are a
ravenous animal and that makes dining
very tough
on the other hand sort of other paired
hormone ghrelin tends to get high
when you are dieting and that drives
hunger and if ghrelin is low then hunger
is quite low as well so you're really
fighting hormones a ton more when you're
leaner because a lot of them actually
detect how much body fat there is and
other through other mechanisms it gets
to be real nasty and then they drive
hunger
these hormones and other pathways can
also lower your need not exercise
activity thermogenesis basically how
much you move around normally and how
sluggish you feel and the leaner you get
especially through that process of
getting lean but also to some extent
being leaner to a smaller extent
your neet can be significantly less
which is a big deal and makes dieting
way harder because you burn fewer
calories all the time and you have to
slash your calories even more to
continue to lose body fat which makes
the diet super fucking hard
number three huge one
at some point
the leaner you get the worse your sleep
gets especially when you start getting
what i've termed before exotically lean
bodybuilder lee
right now i'm giving you this video i am
in my last day of dieting before the
carb up for my next bodybuilding show
the last
two and a half weeks i don't sleep an
entire night
i sleep until about 4 a.m and then i
wake up like this
and my body's like fine food
and i physically can't go to sleep so i
have taken a tiny bit of macros
i'll take exactly 15 grams of protein
from these egg white wraps get at the
store uh
they're not good they're just very
satiating and not tasty i walk over to
my fridge i take out three egg white
wraps
i have like a
tiny like sliver of water i stuff the
egg white wraps i chew them i drink the
water and then my body forgets that it
is starving to death for just long
enough for me to fall back asleep and
then i wake up three or four hours later
and i actually get a full night's sleep
that's it's that brutal
the leaner you get the longer you die
the more fucked up your sleep is now
here's the thing you think okay well i
sleep less whatever
multiple studies now confirm
that
if you get less sleep than is ideal your
proclivity to gain and hold body fat
massively increases your proclivity to
lose muscle mass massively increases and
your ability to grow muscle mass
straight into the fucking shitter it all
goes bad
sleep is such a powerful fat loss
potentiator
that other facets of your diet and
training and etc supplements have to
crank harder to continue to get you lean
so if someone tells me hey man i'm dying
for the show my sleep has been shit
that's a big very very very very very
big concern
and we need to address that sleep
probably through raising food for a
while or restructuring nutrient timing
so the sleep is good so one of the
reasons why people find it really really
tough to get ultra lean from already
being lean is because sleep goes and
once sleep goes man
honestly the way i work with some of the
clients i have in the bodybuilding realm
is there's a bottom end to how hard we
push them it's not like fucking push man
1000 calories a day 500 calories a day
it doesn't matter get lean
the bottom end is this when your sleep
starts to suffer repeatedly night after
night after night we back off you have
to eat more food you have to do maybe
some less activity usually just eat more
food because if you try
to get into the shape of your life
leanness wise and conserve your muscle
while being so starved out that you
can't sleep you're just fighting
yourself and you're going to get worse
results in every possible way you will
literally get leaner and more jacked if
you eat more food and just take a little
bit longer and maybe not even get a lot
longer as soon as your sleep goes you're
fucking done you've got to increase your
calories at least somewhat to fix that
sleep
now point number five is one that i
don't think a lot of people have
considered this is kind of cool maybe
i'm just talking on my ass and tons of
people have considered this
i think we tend to forget that the
leaner we get
the next pound of weight we lose
becomes a bigger fraction of our total
remaining body fat than the previous
pound
so for example
if
you lose six pounds of fat
but you have 60 pounds of total body fat
on your body that's one tenth of your
total body fat your body's not going to
fight you for one tenth that hard i mean
yeah whatever six pounds not you know
take two weeks to lose no big deal
if you want to lose six pounds in two
weeks but you have 18 pounds of body fat
and you're going to go to 12
you are trying
to kebash
one third of your body fat in two
fucking weeks
if we scale that back to the 60 pound
body fat person
that's the same thing as trying to lose
a third 60 20 pounds of fat
in two weeks would you ever fucking try
to do that no you'd be like that's
insane of course it's insane
but here you are
saying oh well you know at the beginning
of my diet i lost six pounds in two
weeks no problem and at the end i should
be able to lose six pounds in two weeks
bullshit
you have to ratio to calories
because otherwise or sorry you have to
ratio your
percent loss to how much you have left
because trying to lose the same
absolute amount of fat every week
means you're you're losing greater and
greater greater relative amounts of fat
and your body through a bunch of hormone
systems keeps track of the relative
amount of fat you lose a shitload of
fraction of your fat
holy crap it's a bad deal and you can
see this in people that are hyper obese
people weigh six seven eight hundred
pounds of medical obesity they
legitimately lose like five to ten
pounds a week for months on end if they
get on a low calorie diet
that's nuts and here's the you think oh
my god they're suffering they're not
even hungry they're just bored of not
eating the junk food that they usually
like if you try that shit it would never
fucking work right even a fraction of
that is impossible because you don't
have that much body fat and every chunk
you lose is a much bigger fraction of
the total and that will make you pay the
price that's one of the big big big
reasons why fat loss gets exponentially
harder the leaner you get because you're
misconstruing the problem you're not
trying to lose the same fraction of fat
because then the absolute amount would
be declining and you could essentially
take your caloric deficit and kind of
bottom it out you're trying to take the
same chunk every time and it's harder
and harder and harder because you have
that little left
so
yeah okay i could just stop this lecture
now and be like that sucks see ya but
we'll give you some uh a few tips and
into how to do something about this to
make the process as painless as possible
it'll still be a bit tough at least
first big one
is to expect this
if you think hey i'm just going to get
to striated glutes and it'll be just as
easy as me getting from 18 to 16 fat
bullshit if you expect the suck then
when it happens you're like all right
i'm in for it i'm here for i thought
this was gonna get rough and here it is
right like they don't recruit soldiers
to go to war and they're like yeah it'll
be fun like what like it's fucking war
it's gonna suck if you expect it
it'll still suck just as much but
there's no mental discordance of like
you wanted this one thing but it's
totally much worse
next
plan for it how here's a huge huge point
you wanna allot
just as much time
to get from ten percent fat to five
percent fat which is super lean
as it took you to get from twenty
percent fat to ten percent fat it's half
of your fat each time
right
and you think okay it took me 16 weeks
to get from 20 fat to 10 fat
but like that was 10 of my fat that i
lost
shouldn't it take me like eight weeks to
get from 10 to five percent because it's
half the amount nope
fractionally it's the same so my humble
recommendation is to take the same
amount of time for that same fraction so
16 weeks just an example from 20 to 10
and then of course maintenance diet to
wash out all the fatigue and you go from
ten to five sixteen weeks not fucking
eight as people look at it at absolute
value like oh i only have to lose like
ten pounds whatever
ten pounds when it's between ten percent
fat five percent fat is going to be like
20 pounds was when you were in the
higher fat percentage nothing you do in
eight weeks
point number three
sort of building on the last thing i
said you want to use multi-phase diets
when you need to
generally speaking you don't want a diet
unless it's a special circumstance you
have a show coming up in 14 weeks then
fine
you don't want to diet for more than
about 12 weeks at a time
after 12 weeks if your goal is more than
12 reasonable weeks away you do however
many weeks maybe 12 then you do a
maintenance phase for like as long as
that 12 weeks was at very least
two-thirds so maybe eight weeks of
maintenance
really reduce diet fatigue
and then go into another eight weeks or
ten weeks or twelve weeks however long
it takes to get to your goal and if you
weigh like 250 pounds right now and you
eventually want to weigh 150 that means
the combination of fat losses and
maintenance can be like eight
different fat loss maintenance that's
one fat loss maintenance that's two
eight of those because you can't just
drop all that weight at once because if
you do you're going to accumulate so
much diet fatigue the shit is going to
get way too hard you're going to rebound
and you're going to go back the other
way people do it every fucking day right
now like 100 people just did that
somewhere around the world don't be one
of those people
lastly
stay on top of your neat of your
physical activity i got the step tracker
by the way it's from my fit am i fit i
don't fucking know some chinese company
it's sweden fucking track steps that's
all i can tell you like do you like it i
don't know it says how many steps i have
it even tells me the time
right it's super cheap it was on amazon
i asked charlie to get me one and he got
me the fucking cheapest one it's sweet
that's a hell of an endorsement right
myfit ceos are watching this like what
an asshole maybe you guys will buy it
who knows
stay on top of your activity
stop tracker is a great way to start
like my past diet that i'm ending right
now as you can see my face is all fucked
up from not having any fucking body fat
left or any desire to live
uh my face prior to this i is an average
of 11 000 steps every single day average
some days are higher some days are lower
if you track your steps and you manage
to get minimum amounts same amount you
were getting on like a maintenance just
click that in raise it by a thousand or
two and that's it the entire fat loss
phase it really just eliminates all the
neat problems because you're actually
quantitatively tracking so it's really
good
and stay on top of your sleep right
if you don't stay on top of your sleep
and your sleep goes you're just fucking
you're fucking done right you may still
make it to the show or make it to the
photo shoot or make it to your leanest
ever but it's going to be 10 times more
painful than it needs to be
and if you say okay i need to keep track
of my sleep
and if my sleep goes to hell i need to
back off so i already know i can't just
bottom up my calories
but what you're telling me is
that we don't want to try to push the
fat off super fast when we're getting
lean we want to coax it off we want to
take our time and that's exactly the
most important piece of advice here
when you're going from lean to leaner
take a little bit more time than you
think you need
and you'll end up being much more
successful than if you try to rush
that's all i got i'm gonna go think
about food my carb load starts tomorrow
so then i'm gonna stop thinking and
start eating
yay see you guys next time
you
