hey folks Dr Mike here really
interesting topic of discussion for
today more of a little bit of a
philosophical situation for you when is
drug use in sport cheating and how bad
is that sort of thing
you get a lot of comments
let's say Somebody Like Larry Wheels
posts a video and inevitably someone
says yeah but steroids
and someone will say yeah man he's
cheating it sucks it's a shortcut and
then if you're reasonably intelligent
you start thinking ah interesting
is what he's doing cheating is he being
tested is there some kind of competition
are other people tested and you start to
realize that this moral landscape of
using drugs and cheating can be quite
complicated but not so complicated I
think we can peel this apart in the next
you know uh 10 to 30 minutes depending
on how many rants I get in and
irrelevant jokes that are funny to No
One including me
so
as I see it the moral landscape with
drug use and cheating in sport
has kind of uh two things going on that
are quite separate and often get
confused but are very very distinct
one is cheating the law
so you cheated by violating it with
regard to drug use the
jurisdiction you're in let's say the
country says you know let's say steroid
use is illegal you choose to use anyway
and you are thus violating the law and
that absolutely is a form of cheating
and no matter what the law is
it makes a lot of sense to understand
that breaking the law breaking any
formal codified rule in society is a
form of unethical conduct in and of
itself
because the very act and Ethos of a
rules-based order is itself uh itself
has a moral worth
not breaking rules
no matter what they are is generally a
better thing on average if you really
trickle down to what morality is then
just being like fuck it I just like
rules rules baby rules are made to be
broken like that's not such a good thing
the average behavior on any system with
a set of rules if you code one type of
individual actor in game theory that
typically follows the rules and one that
typically does not generally the
rules-based system uh will just be
better for everyone if more people
follow the rules on average of course
like if you live in North Korea breaking
the rules is a matter of survival an
insanely really ethical but in most
cases breaking law is generally not
something to Pat yourself on the back
for so there is that just breaking the
law by itself is a little bit not so
great ethically and uh that's not uh us
right
so taking drugs when they are legal
technically unethical to some some
extent
but in the grand scheme not a huge moral
lapse if it hurts nobody but you or even
not you so if you you know take a 30-day
cycle of anavar or something before I'm
you know a trip to the beach and you
look nice at the beach
nobody lost nobody found okay and if
someone's like you're a fucking criminal
like technically correct but also
exactly who did I hurt here and the
answer is literally no one and um you
know what are called Consensual crimes
or victimless crimes it's a real thing
and so yes nominally you did uh you are
cheating in some some certain way you're
doing something that's not so ethical
but the degree of its immorality is
insanely low in many cases so that's
something to remember so you know it is
also something to remember when you go
vote and you're like you know should we
make like uh performance enhancing drugs
have the same kinds of uh punishments as
like fentanyl or some kind of drug
that'll make you go out and stab people
in the face in the street to try to get
more gee you know that's a tough sell
because there's just no epidemic of
people who take performance announcing
drugs destroying Society or the lives of
others this is not a thing that happens
with uh it happens with a frequency
that's like a hundred thousand times
lower per use rate than alcohol and that
shit is legal so I'll get off that high
horse shortly but it is definitely a
wrong you're doing it wrong but it's a
very very small room and it actually
doesn't intersect essentially at all
with sport because I noticed I didn't
mention sport at all that's what number
two is four so the second case in which
their second kind of cheating to do with
uh performance enhancing drugs is
cheating other competitors in sport okay
by using banned drugs banned substances
to get the Competitive Edge
for the same reason that breaking the
law is bad in a let's say a society or
country a nation-state a jurisdiction
because breaking rules is generally bad
on average as its own action
it's also bad to break Federation rules
when you cheat even if it doesn't fuck
over any other athletes for example
let's say it's a competition of 10
people
and the nine people next to you in
competition all run
10 second hundreds or faster and you run
a 16 second hundred
which I think you can walk 116 seconds
or something you're jogging and you gear
up to the fucking Moon
to run a 14 second hundred and you still
take dead last technically you didn't
fuck anybody else over
your gear use your performance
enhancement didn't affect any other
competitors their placings their
sponsorships nothing but you still did
something wrong because you're a lying
son of a bitch because the sport
governing body Federation invited you to
compete and you agreed when you signed
the ship that you weren't going to take
anything they said you weren't allowed
to take so you still did a bad bad but
it's not the same kind of bad as if you
fuck other competitors over
so yes it's bad to break the rules but
also the real bad is when you break in
the rules to actively fuck other people
of shit they had due to them for example
you are going to take forth without gear
the top three people who get medals
didn't take gear you took gear and now
you're rank two you bumped one person
completely off the medal stand and one
person would have gotten silver now
getting bronze that's fucked up you're
cheating hurt other people not hurt in
the physical sense it took something
that was due to them that is pretty
fucking immoral you're ripping people
off of titles and placings and
potentially sponsorships and all that
other crazy kind of shit it's a bad
thing you're doing but it's a bad thing
that is shaded in Grays all of the Grays
are bad but the darker ones are you know
or the lighter ones depending you can
see of it are the really bad things and
there are some other Shades in which
you're like it's bad but it's not that
bad the real study and thought about
morality is not ones and zeros it's not
this is moral this is immoral that's
what you tell children when people grow
up to be adults you say well some things
are really really really fucking immoral
and you shouldn't do them some things
are
you know just barely to put something to
you um they're convincing
reasons that folks like Sam Harris have
described for I should never lie but
um if if the CIA catches you or with
known people who have a tactical nuclear
weapon they're going to detonate New
York City and you lie about where it is
and you know five million people die you
did a real bad thing by lying if the fat
guy at work is done a fitness program
and
um he comes by and he's like I lost 15
pounds and I weighs 300 instead of 315
if you're like dude Bob you look fucking
great you're lying he still looks like a
fat piece of shit but
she whiz you know who did you hurt with
that one there's all kinds of really on
the margins talk we could say about well
you're setting up his expectations for
later blah blah blah but in reality that
as you you guys can illustrate there's
huge Shades of Gray and those same the
big spectrum of Shades of Gray
50 Shades of Gray better pay us for
plugs right Scott the video guy
I'm saying what's that movie about it's
like s m or whatever
and the fast shit was in Reverse you
bullied be all up in that shit whatever
anyway it's either here or there I want
to be a little intern for a CEO I think
that's what he's about in any case
big Shades of Gray even in the context
of cheating in sport so let's open up
that big old can of worms and see what
the worms look like so
couple scenarios one two three
four five
scenarios that all are starting I think
from
no problem at all
no moral ethical problem all the way up
to like you're a piece of shit should
really reconsider what the fuck you're
doing
first
and all of these by the way involve drug
use so we can say that equating drug use
to a Bad Thing automatically is a
non-starter and here's why
scenario number one drugs are legal in
the country in which you're using them
or in the jurisdiction which you're
using them and the sport Federation
doesn't test they don't care
Pro bodybuilding in Thailand you can go
buy steroids at the fucking pharmacy in
Thailand nobody gives a flying fuck and
if it's Pro bodybuilding and it's not
natural probity building just regular
probiotic building nobody cares
everyone's on drugs nobody gives a shit
the verdict there is that that is
ethical on all grounds you are doing
nothing wrong so if you're at the gym in
Thailand pumping up full of steroids and
training and someone's like fucking
cheater you could be like technically
speaking I'm not actually violating any
loss whatsoever you know and if they can
understand that they've been learned a
lot of nerds in any case that's
absolutely a way to be doing drugs and
they're not damn thing wrong with that
it's just between you your health and
God that's it
next scenario that gets into the grave
that was purely all clear all good to go
drugs are illegal in your jurisdiction
let's say your country but the sport
Federation still doesn't test perfect
example professional bodybuilding in the
United States General United States is
illegal to use a lot of the support
performance enhancing drugs that are
used in Pro bodybuilding when a
probiotic leaders don't care nobody
asked nobody answered no tests nothing
like that there is not even the
implication of being drug-free
so the verdict on that is it's uh it's
definitely unethical with respect to
Legal obedience again breaking the law
by itself can be caricatured in many
valid ways to be at least a little bit
immoral and uh but it is quite ethical
with respect to sport competition
because you know gee whiz can you
imagine like seeing a pro bodybuilder
like uh he's going to the bathroom off
stage in a probiotic only show and
you're like fucking cheater he's like
what uh how do I cheat wait what do you
mean did I stand too close in front of
the judges that I spiked the other guy's
drink with like salt like no man you're
using steroids he's like oh boy have you
been in the show like no like coming in
they're like oh shit everyone's on the
shit well I guess it's an even playing
field in that regard so definitely uh
icky not great to be proud of breaking
the law in your country
um you can think of a country as kind of
we're all on the same team trying to
work for the same general purpose and
breaking the rules is bad maybe not
terrible but certainly not something to
be proud of but on the Sport front
there's dudes no sport cheating going on
okay again if you tell you know uh could
cut if you come up to uh you know how
did Japan you know Mr Olympia and you're
like you're cheating at sport with
bodybuilding drugs you'd be like I'm
sorry do you know what cheating means
have you seen the sport so definitely
not a concern there now
uh scenario number three
the Federation prohibits drug use
we're going to take the legal stuff
aside you guys already know that that's
all it's either legal or legal and
slightly immoral or or totally fine
just focusing in on sport now the
Federation prohibits drug use
but cheating is commonplace perhaps
almost ubiquitous perfect example is
international professional cycling
holy fucking shit I saw at least one
paper quite well done mathematically
where they estimated that the first time
you get to a 50 50 chance of finding a
drug-free cyclist is at the time this
isn't um
2010s uh it was rank 700 on the
international Pro list
holy fuck that means everyone ranked 699
and above has a greater than 50
statistical chance of being on drugs so
you can you can imagine the top ten
wow it would be highly unlikely to find
somebody who's drug free so the verdict
for this
is technically unethical because you are
breaking sport Federation rules but of a
very very low magnitude you are
absolutely trying to get an edge on your
opponent but your opponent is using
pretty much the same Technologies to get
an edge it is an arms race but it's one
that looks like this
um it's hard to say that you know when
people got upset for example with Lance
Armstrong for cheating and every single
fucking cycling race he's ever done
um you know people are like oh how could
he it's like do you know what you're do
you know what Pro cycling looks like
there's not a goddamn person within
fucking eyesight of him that's not
fucking using drugs so gee you know it's
a different landscape than if well
preview some of the stuff we're going to
talk about just a bit where the cheating
is much more straightforward much
clearer it's much more fucked up so do I
have like a ton of love and respect for
this kind of cheating no not even close
is it icky yeah fuck yeah it's fucking
the whole thing is uh but um
is it this huge magnitude of moral wrong
no it's blah it's not great but it's not
the worst thing in the world you guys
know what I'm saying
um I'll tell you something personally
for me clearly I'm not fucking drug free
duh and uh later in my life I will
absolutely be drug freeze I fucking hate
using this shit I'm just using it to
bodybuild I fucking hate all the shits
involved with it
but uh I'm also a competitive Jiu Jitsu
Grappler right now I have my brown belt
and I've competed a ton before you have
never seen me in an ibjf competition and
you never will why because iggf is like
Pro cycling uh steroids are banned but
they test almost no one almost never and
they um will pop a person here and there
every few years it's a bit controversial
then it goes away so a ton of the guys
at the top dare I say many are
um dare I say the majority rather
or you know they're taking tons of gear
or maybe not tons but some some and so
is it terrible when like the guy who
wins Jiu Jitsu worlds is on steroids
like you know people are scored Brian's
on steroids like yeah so are all those
guys that compete in that drug tested
fed and actually took Gordon's uh huge
credit I don't he doesn't really compete
in I have a ggf anymore and uh because I
guess it's too soft for him or whatever
and also like when he did compete in wgf
he didn't look like he was on gear at
the time at the very least so it's kind
of like you know what Gordon's on gear
you could tell and so it's one of those
things where you know you can't say it's
a huge deal but it's icky enough for me
for me to never do it so I'm never going
to compete in drug tested sport of any
kind because I have used drugs and they
change you sort of forever so that's
just something on my own personal plan
this is how I think about the matter in
my own regard
all right next up
the Federation prohibits drug use a
sport governing body says drug use is no
no bueno
and cheating is rare So an example of
this is natural bodybuilding in the
United States right now I have a job for
you I want you to go into the comments
and tell me how full of shit I am and
how I'm new to the game and how I'm a
fucking dupe and tell me about every
single drug free natural bodybuilder in
the United States is actually on
boatloads of gear and make sure to tip
the hat to Grandma and to your porn
collection because you're 15 years old
you live at home and you've not got no
idea what's going on I'm totally kidding
on all this guns I know I'm going to get
a ton of hate for this but I do actually
believe that at least a very large
fraction of drug-free bodybuilding us
actually is drug free
um but so I guess everyone's on drugs
blah blah blah save that shit for
another time or just go in the comments
and hit it up but
um when at least a large fraction of the
people are drug-free and the sport
governing body says drugs are not
something you can use
cheating is pretty fucking unethical
like if you are doing like the fucking
you know wnbf Pro worlds or whatever
drug drug tested Federation and you use
fucking drugs to like take third place
in that or whatever what the fuck is
wrong with you just go and compete and
untested bodybuilding you stupid idiot
fucking pathetic and if you say well
everyone else is on drugs it's probably
not true you're just an excuse making
fuck pussy I got nothing else to say to
you
and rent okay I'm sure Scott's video guy
I think we're getting comments about
that uh whole rant
oh geez all right so enjoy that
um lastly the most in my view unethical
possible way to cheat with drugs and
sport is to do the following
the Federation has a tested arm and an
untested arm it has an arm in which you
can use drugs they don't care they'll
Drake the shit whatever you do back
there and an arm in which drug testing
is there and it's strict and you can't
do it
if you take drugs and cheat then go into
the tested arm
there is a special place
in pussy ass hell for you what the fuck
is wrong with you compete with the drug
people if you're gonna take drugs
there's literally an arm for you to do
all your fucking dirtiest why am I
saying this because it happens
I was in there's a powerful Federation
I'm sure it's still around there it's
called the APF great fed and there's an
arm of it called the aapf which is the
uh drug free version and it's great
lifting all around equipped power
lifting great stuff and there was a guy
once who must zigged and zagged around
that drug test he was in the aapf the
drug tested on
jacked out of his fucking mind
he was like 40 something and it veins
all over his face down his neck red the
reddest person he made liver King look
like a pale white dude
red as fuck
means every lean checked red
on drugs okay I've I've been around a
while on fucking drugs
I wouldn't even make eye contact with
the guy this was back when I was drug
free I'm like
what's a why why go and he oh he did
real well beating drug-free people
the lowest bottom of pathetic
unbelievable that is for sure unethical
really fucking lame
definitely don't do that right which
brings me to kind of wrap up this whole
situation that's the moral landscape as
I see it I'm sure I missed a couple of
things here and there but uh hopefully
you guys can ask some questions and make
some comments uh below and let me know
like hey like what about this what about
that I would sure love to respond
um
I think in my view
the most important moral imperative is
to not hurt anyone or take anything from
someone that they were due that's really
like the very very core of most moral
systems and moral reasoning
everything else breaking rules that hurt
nobody
um you know breaking rules in a way that
doesn't affect other people at all with
placings and stuff
um that can be shaded in Grays and
there's lots of Shades of Gray so for
example you know you could say well
professional cycling there's some
drug-free people in there that you are
fucking over a few drugs that's true
it's just marginal there's way fewer you
know in natural bodybuilding there's way
more people are drug-free but some of
the guys are on drugs so if you take
drugs to treat a natural bodybuilding
you're doing a very bad thing but like
technically you're beating some other
cheater so it's less bad lots of Shades
of Gray there
um
I would just say you know make your own
moral choices do stuff you can live with
because
sleeping at night as a motherfucker and
it's really great and you don't want to
do anything for short-term winnings or
Pride that makes you feel less than
afterwards and is it cool to win stuff
yes
um but is it cool to win stuff when you
had to cheat your way to do it
my answer for me is fuck no your answer
for you could be more complicated on the
margins but um remember that like you
don't want to do anything that lives
with you for a while you know what I'm
saying I've seen John Wick I know how
demons can get you
in any case folks let me know what you
think below
and I'll see you next time
