got a can if you need
[Music]
it today we have a special treat I'm Dr
Mike Israel friend s presentation that's
my biological son Jared feather IB Pro
for Jared feather ibpr doxxx I would
look that up that's a fun website and so
what we're doing today is the world's
toughest on set asterisk quad workout
it's just one set but it's a mega drop
set I'll tell you about all that how
that works in the meantime I'm going to
introduce you to Mr Tan Mr Trevor these
are team for ROM W they're sort of in
charge of the fucking place the these
are the people we had to bring in
because this workout in order for it to
be highly effective and it is unreal
effective it will grow tons of muscle
compared to workouts that have 10 and 15
sets yes I do mean that but the tenacity
required to stick with that one crazy
ass drop set as you will soon see it's
so intense we couldn't try this work on
just regular people even most Pros
because they would honestly quit it just
would go nowhere these are the two most
insane people we know in training shout
out to Izzy narez who really is the most
insane person we know as far as training
go go go come on E go go but these two
guys are right there with them they're
going to try really really really hard
there is no acting there's no Hollywood
look at these people they're too stupid
to know how to act they barely know how
to tie their shoes but they know how to
go fucking hard let's get it
done so we said one set for the
clickbait and it technically is one set
it's a giant drop set so we're going to
do is we're going to start with a set of
10 to 15 reps in the hack Squat and the
guys won't stop until they're done done
in the first set we're probably going to
aim for a few my rep sets which means
they're going to get maybe 10 or
something like that they're going to
lock out it's all soft lockouts until
about 10 or so then they're going to
rest a few seconds still the same set
you haven't really racked the weight
keep going for another five reps or so
until you gas rack lock out rest for a
second keep going again do a couple of
those then Jared and I take some weight
off in order to allow you to get more
volume still the same set we're cheating
here for sure but welcome to YouTube
it's all clickbait I'm not even a real
doc after that we repeat the same cycle
internally to every single load on the
way down until the guys are squatting
the fucking Implement by itself at that
point we're making sure those soft
lockouts are engaged because with true
lockouts you can rest a ton and then one
rep after one rep after one rep with an
unloaded Implement can just be recovery
work at that point point we need to be
stimulative so they're going to make
sure they don't lock out all the way and
that's going to be fucking brutal watch
this bro watch this it's going to get
fucking somebody might fucking die let's
do

yeah you got a can if you need

now I actually got to train
[Laughter]
hard I've never trained fucking that
hard in my life I've never even thought
about training that hard by the way he's
trying to stand up try to stand up again
okay yep hey you're going to pull the K
do set of sissy squats you it off down
which one of yous going to pick me up
right hey YouTube who has a dumber
haircut
[Laughter]
huh maybe you'll get all the pla on this
one
huh as Mike alluded to when we intro the
video uh this is something that when
you're squatting this way can be very
very effective so if you try this and
you're shortening the range of motion
and you're kind of just moving and
you're alternating the technique quite a
bit during the set it might not be as
effective but because force times
distance is a huge component to volume
and you know this man is like 63 6'4 uh
he's going to be doing quite a bit of
volume in this one set this is
definitely something you can tack on at
the end of a messa cycle for as an
intensity technique the set probably
wouldn't last this long but if you're
going to do something like this uh one
set it's the end of a bodybuilding
contest rep or something you still need
to work really fucking hard but you need
to back off on the volume of Tad this
could be a really good intensity
technique to use but you have to make
sure that you're incorporating that
entire force times distance all the full
range of motion full control everything
that we always talk about so give it a
try if you want to at the you know
toward the end of a contest script be
smart especially in that control
Ecentric phase that's when you can get
hurt and as you can see these two men
squatting you're going to see the kind
of control that you should be aiming
for
my man keep
breathing
watch let's do it
