periodization this is Jared fether I
also from Renaissance criz now hold on
now before you take a look at this I you
to realize happening it's a trying time
in this world China's On The Rise
Russia's being a bad actor Iran who
knows what they're doing the United
States needed a weapon and we already
had Wonder Woman but they're like let's
put that bitch on some super serum and
she's like bam and then we're like okay
she's basically complete but in order to
test the being and its supreme power we
have to train high volume psychotic drop
set delts jenigiri you ready I'm ready
it's been a while let's do it all right
guys first exercise is the lying cable
front raise it's just a cable front
raise and actually because your palms
are facing this way and not up trains a
lot of the front and side delt so it's a
really great side delt exercise does hit
the front belts as well why are we lying
down one is for novelty but that's
fucking old because the floor has got
germs and literal pieces of shit on it I
mean I don't know about you guys but I
shit on the floor to
JY because it's lying down you don't
have to support your own own skeletal
structure anymore it actually reduces
the axial and systemic fatigue
substantially this is an exercise to try
let me Demo it for you guys to see if I
can't fall over and kill
myself hey watch this classic Jewish
athleticism hey help Lifeline I've
fallen and I can't get
up
slow and it's important especially to go
slow at the toughest part which is going
to be roughly here at a 90° angle here
really slow it down and then continue
Mike that would keep better tension on
the bels cool all right we might get on
a different machine but either way hey
