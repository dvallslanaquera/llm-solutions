hit cardio stands for high intensity
interval training and this is when you
do like 20 seconds Max intensity then a
20 second rest and do that like 10 times
so the workout's only like five minutes
and you burn more calories during the
workout and after the workout I I
guarantee you don't if you're doing
steady state cardio and it's not the
easiest thing in the world you can burn
many more calories in a 40-minute
session of Stacy cardio that you could
do anything for five minutes long
this is straight up false
