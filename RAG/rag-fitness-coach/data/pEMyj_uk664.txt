so if you're recovering you should train
again and that's one of the big myths of
the Bro split is it assumes that pretty
much all muscles take the same amount of
time to heal if you train them with a
certain given volume and that's just not
true your hamstrings take way more
damage than pretty much every other
muscle if you train your hamstrings four
times a week you're not really train
your hamstrings you're doing four
warm-ups a week because if you really
trained them you probably wouldn't be
able to train him but twice maybe one
and a half times per week hard on the
other hand if you're training biceps if
you're training side delts there's no
 way it takes you a week to heal
from that so you should be training
the muscles with slightly higher
frequencies if they recover more
