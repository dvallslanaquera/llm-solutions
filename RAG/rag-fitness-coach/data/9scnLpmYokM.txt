all right 100 squats 0 0 0 0 00000000 0
okay that's not full range motion if it
was a deeper squat it would accomplish
more benefit with less time and no need
to do lots of repetitions in any case
100 reps it's so far away from failure
at every point up until 100 that the
amount of muscle recruitment is actually
very minimal uh most of the growth
you'll get in your muscles is training
with challenging sets between five and
30 repetitions anywhere you choose to
stop should be close to failure because
doing 100 this is uh kind of a very
boring way to burn not so many calories
and um is not a very good workout for
the legs certainly not for strength or
size it will condition you okay to be
able to do 100 half squats in a row
that's just about what it does best
