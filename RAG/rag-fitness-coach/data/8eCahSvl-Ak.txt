real quick this is just to embarrass the
fuck out of you
[Music]
folks I'm Dr Mike this is Jared feather
ifbd Pro this is Alex Leonidas and he
only does one kind of chest workout
hardcore barbells dumbbells and body
weight
no thanks machines no thanks cables no
thanks weird pulling angles Alex
Leonidas just one man no 300 today one
big ass compound heavy chest workout and
Jared feather here to be a technique
stickler how you feeling I'm feeling
great Mike happy to be here can't wait
to show what the faces can produce like
you said barbells dumbbells dips can't
go wrong hitting all the angles let's
get it in
foreign
the bench press is an excellent exercise
to build the chest for a few reasons one
it biases the lengthen position because
that's the mechanically the most
difficult position which is also the
most hypertrophic position
two it's a barbell movement which means
it's incredibly stable especially with
good technique you can produce a ton of
Force Recruiting pretty much all of your
muscle fibers in your pecs
and lastly if you have a really good
technique it puts your packs in a real
safe position shoulders in a real safe
position nice and retractive chest up
the stimulus to fatigue Ratio or the
barbell bench press can be incredible if
used the technique and if you have the
body type for it some people don't like
it that's totally fine
but if you've heard somewhere bench of
sub-optimal for pet gains bullshit tons
of guys built enormous packs
with the flat barbell bench press we're
going to be doing sets of five to ten
maybe 10 to 15 here
we'll let Jared clue everyone in let's
get it done
and the peck should be going toward the
ceiling hole so you're not caving at all
so you should be leading the bar and
then even as you press up even more of
the text to the ceiling okay it's like a
soft touch sometimes I'm holding it like
I'm not resting it I'm not right on the
top it's going to drop by quite a bit
but like we're here for a fucking great
stimulus absolutely yeah for sure do you
want these matching
that is not good for my brain right
there yeah see yep yeah I'm the same way
man descending into mental illness
excellent
foreign
way fucking heavier it's got to be
perfect it's much different than the
power lifting bench press I gotcha do uh
one or two reps just to potentiate and
then get to the work set after
or are you good to just start work set I
was gonna just start it in as long as
you take nice pauses we're good to go
I'm gonna wrap up
all right
[Music]
eat the bar meet the bar now press the
packs yes sir
big chest
yeah
one more come on Beat the bar
chest to the ceiling on the way up on
the way up on the way up
push
good shit dude
hell yeah
God damn that was good
fuck man tried to keep a hell of strict
what was that seven or something I was
like six seven yeah I found my pecs
ripping yeah on everywhere like it
really hurts that's what we want 225
yeah oh damn so we're gonna
get some paint in here
to the ceiling big push one more
[Music]
only the cave come on man do this Mike's
right there you're good
thanks ceiling ceiling go go go
oh all right I didn't really help man
that was you people are like let the
scouts move freely I'm like that's a
terrible terrible advice I don't know
where that came from what biomechanics
expert AKA functional Anatomy
enthusiasts came up with that bullshit
but it's completely wrong to stretch the
pecs this stretches the PEX less this
stretches the more absolutely what the
fuck are they talking about like I don't
yeah especially if it's length and
biased yeah like a ball of bench press
so you're not going for that I can
understand if it's done by the
converging effect sure maybe then you
want to protract and get your arm across
so
[Music]
beautiful come on
shit here we go last one they're just
stealing
go
whoa
oh man
humbling it's very humbling and it's
but just goes to show you don't need
that much throw it away and when you do
the reaching especially oh yeah because
like guy was telling me before of course
the bond is that tendency to want to
rush that last portion that's the most
important part yes and it's not enough
to just rush down here and hold it
because you can get good at messing that
technique yeah that's how guys move big
waves just you know they drop it yeah
hold and then just explode yeah but if
you really reduce all momentum
control that weight the short arms do
yep right there like muscles do the work
yeah man it's tough that's it for bench
let's go do incline dumbbells
[Music]
[Music]
no I've never used these things before
me either this is kind of wanted to
drive in the videos hell yeah so chest
up can you do this totally sure can you
do this sure
but the packs open up if you do this and
they get a big stretch
so you start in this imagine there's a
straight line to your face that goes all
the way through to the outside of your
shoulders
start here open up elbows out reach big
at the bottom to get really between your
own get these dumbbell things right here
under your chest to touch your bicep
right get that low pause for a sec and
then curve back up
big reach curve back up right can I
bring dumbbells out
but somewhat of a neutral grip because
I'm still getting the stretch if I'm out
here right grip should be okay just make
sure the range of motion yeah
especially like I'm not gonna tell you
no okay okay yeah let me see what feels
good because uh when you're warm it
changes things well big chest
and then press excellent control super
deep big chest
oh yeah
yeah one after another just like that
push your chest up I use the pecs pecs
packs yes
control fast stop
huge chest the biggest one push up and
in push in
yes
hey look at that and go push them
forward
thanks a lot Jerry
ready shit
yo I love that reaching cue it makes
such a difference cool right oh my God
so you like uh arching on the incline
that shitload really eh yeah that's why
we have varying degrees right exactly
like an arch really fucking hard on a
high incline and put the degrees change
a little bit but the stretch is just so
much better for the facts exactly so
it's better to do a higher incline and
Arch to an angle lower 100 then just
keeping it low but you're not tight
it sets up your scaff it does everything
to align you it also collapses you down
so that there's no movement possible
because if you start with a flat back
and then as you press you start arching
more it's going to change the shit while
you're doing it exactly and that's kind
of weird we like to lock into the
technique once we're locked in the stand
beautiful man beautiful one more
[Applause]
beautiful
oh crap
that'll work that'll fucking work thank
you man yeah
yeah I'm just I don't know what to say
it hurts I don't know what to say say
it's time for dips
[Music]
chest is pretty Fried by this point we
had bench we had dumbbell press
dips are going to be done low and slow
of course with a nice pots at the bottom
for a big stretch under tension and uh
Alex has done dips with I believe four
plates hanging before roughly this body
weight and uh this is going to be a big
big difference because we're asking them
to go slow on the way down we're asking
them to get a deeper stretch than usual
we're doing it after two exercises six
working sets of
quite difficult chest work
and uh he might actually only have to
use like 45 or something like that we'll
probably do two sets of weighted dips
and then take the weight off for the
last set and do a burnout set of
unweighted dips to finish this psychotic
chest workout from Hell
couple more
go
and rap
oh yeah
oh yeah
maximum stretch
I would say you can get just as low as
dumbbells yeah if not lower because
there's no obstruction yeah feel it in
your packs always excellent you are
likely to get sore
most likely
all stretch based no squeezing across
the body
just free weights getting it in I hate
that shit the data is pointing now
that the length of position is generally
best for hypertrophy yeah and the pecs
in particular have been proven to
respond well to that as well as the
calves and whatnot right so how relevant
is to do like Tech fly motions and all
that kind of stuff it's a good question
I think that there might be a chance
where there's some Regional hypertrophy
through squeezing
but we'd have to get some good data on
that to be sure about it uh I think
otherwise it squeezes mostly a waste of
time but sometimes for variation I think
it's okay and it might turn out there's
something there in the end we definitely
know never squeeze at the expense of the
stretch right see if I have a machine
that looks a great top hold but the
stretch sucks that you got to change
something right that's what I would say
control
deep
Summit
yep
good no rush calmly just take it off
take your time
[Music]
beautiful Alex let's go slow
big chest
one more
[Music]
oh that's it okay and off the machine
one hand on each side oh no no out here
all the way out here this one here yes
look forward super deep pause and up
down
slow as deep as you can open the chest
up yep up go go go go go go go great
rest a little
go go go go nice and deep Ultra deep
fuck yeah up you got it you got the
strike go go go go go go go go go go go
go lock it lock it lock it lock it lock
it lock it lock it lock it come on come
on and try a regular push-up on the
ground I knew you're gonna say that I
Know It come on real quick this is just
to embarrass the fuck out of you good
strict push-up chest to the ground all
the way down stomach up yep
and up
and one more
look forward
[Music]
that's it
beautiful now we know the chest is done
that's how you work your pecs right
there
oh
oh
thank you man dude good shit got me good
there good shit it's funny
um
when you go to failure
and you're training with good technique
first of all it sneaks up on you and
second about how unimpressive it looks
emotionally people expect like a fucking
war and you're just like
yeah it's momentary muscular failure
that it really is and in some cases like
with pulling exercises and legs it could
be this like seconds long process that's
hell but for me with triceps and chest
just like
belts won't move anymore so yeah Alex it
was a huge pleasure having you man Mike
huge pleasure Jared anything any uh
advice for folks out there who want to
build a big chest maybe you don't have a
ton of machines
listen I build my chest
off barbells dumbbells body weight
training actually the majority was built
from push-ups and dips I've never used
machines for my chest up until last year
and even then I would not credit any
serious development except for maybe the
upper chest in the case of the Smith
machine overall
this is a body built by the old school
Basics the flat bubble bench press
incline double bench press equated dip
literally stuff that I always do we did
it today
but with an extra emphasis on getting
more out of less weight and with Jared's
special technique we're really reaching
and trying to go beyond your active
range rather than artificially stopping
it because you don't have the mobility
quote unquote that's how you get results
you want to stay in this game long term
you got nobody to impress except maybe
people have the uh the beach once you
have yes and that's probably scared
there you go and then they will fear you
as they should
see us next time
