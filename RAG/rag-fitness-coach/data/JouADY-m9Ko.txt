in a general strength or hypertrophy
training program
there are many different ways we can
categorize the exercises used
one of these ways is to categorize
exercises as either free weight
which includes barbells and dumbbells or
machine based
some consider free weights to be
superior mainly due to the increased
stabilization requirements
it's theorized the greater instability
with free weights can result in greater
muscle fiber recruitment
on the other hand a stable environment
with machines
could allow an individual to focus more
on the intended muscles
additionally some machines are designed
to match the strength
of an exercise meaning they challenge
the working muscle
or muscles to a high degree throughout
the range of motion
so which is best for hypertrophy free
weights
or machines this is what a recent study
by schwann beck and colleagues assessed
15 men and 21 women with an average of
two years training experience
were randomly assigned to either a free
weight group or a machine group
for both groups training consisted of
cycling two days of training
with one day of rest on day one both
groups train the chest
back and triceps on day two both groups
train their legs shoulders and biceps
this whole cycle was repeated for eight
weeks
the freeway group on day one for the
chest back and triceps
performed the flat barbell bench press
incline barbell bench press
bent over barbell rows chin ups tricep
skull crushers
and dumbbell kickbacks
the machine group on day one for the
chest back and triceps
perform the smith machine bench press
smith machine incline bench press
machine seated row lap pull down machine
triceps press down
and a rope press down
the freeway group on day two for the
legs shoulders and biceps
perform the barbell back squat straight
leg deadlift
lunge single leg calf raise dumbbell
shoulder press
dumbbell lateral raise easy bar curl and
preacher curl
[Music]
the machine group on day two for the
legs shoulders and biceps
perform the smith machine squat leg
extension
seated hamstring curl machine calf raise
machine shoulder press machine lateral
raise
machine biceps curl and machine's
preacher curl
for the first three weeks both groups
performed each exercise with four sets
of eight to ten reps to failure
with one minute of rest between sets for
the next three weeks
both groups performed each exercise with
four sets of six to eight reps to
failure
with one minute and 30 seconds of rest
between sets for the last two weeks
both groups performed each exercise with
three sets or
four to five reps to failure with two
minutes of rest between sets
throughout these three phases if
subjects were able to
load was increased on any of their
exercises ultrasound was used to measure
thickness of the quadriceps
and biceps before and after the training
period for both groups
for strength one rep max on the barbell
bench press
and one rep max on the smith machine
bench press was assessed before and
after the training period for both
groups
additionally a six to ten rep max on the
barbell back squat
and a six to ten rep max on the smith
machine score were measured for both
groups before and after the trading
period
these six to ten rep maxes were used to
predict one rep max values for both
their exercises
starting off with the strength results
both groups actually experience
similar increases in barbell bench press
warner max
[Music]
four one rep max on the smith machine
bench press the machine group
experienced greater gains compared to
the freeway group
four predicted barbell back squat one
right maxes both groups experienced
statistically similar increases
however it's very clear to see that
percentage-wise
the freeway group experienced greater
gains
four predicted smith machines caught one
rare maxes
both groups experienced similar
increases
according to the principle of
specificity we would expect the free
weight group to experience greater gains
for the barbell exercises
while we would expect the machine group
to experience greater gains for the
smith machine exercises
this was true for the smith machine
bench press and barbell back squat
but intriguingly this did not seem to
apply to the barbell bench press
or smith machine score nevertheless this
study did only last
eight weeks in the long run it's very
likely that if your aim is to maximize
strength on the barbell bench press
or smith machine score performing that
particular exercise frequently
will be necessary moving on to the
hypertrophy results
both groups experience similar increases
in biceps thickness
and quadriceps thickness
in other words both free weights and
machines
appear to produce similar hypertrophy
now of course it would have been more
informative if the researchers could
have assessed hypertrophy of a few other
muscle groups
as both groups did train the majority of
their body
but regardless when looking at the
mechanisms of muscle growth
reasoning does seem to suggest that both
free weights and machines
can produce similar hypertrophy
mechanical tension is the best
categorized driver of muscle growth
currently
mechanical tension consists of active
tension and passive tension
active tension is the force generated by
the contractile units of the muscle
if we were to look at the layers of a
muscle within muscle fibers
i found myofibrils sarcomeres
which are the contractile units of
muscle are located here
forces generated when something called
the myosin head
extends from the myosin filament and
pulls the actin filament
towards the m line shortening the length
of the sarcomere
the force generated from this is partly
transmitted longitudinally
but mainly laterally to the
extracellular matrix
where these forces end up pulling on the
tendon causing muscle contraction
it's believed meccano sensors detect
this force
and initiate a signaling cascade that
ultimately results in muscle hypertrophy
now here's the thing regardless of
what's used a barbell
dumbbell machine or even body weight
taking a movement close to failure with
a load between 30
and 85 warner max will result in
sufficiently high amounts of active
tension overall
for a sustained period so although it's
possible freeways recruit more fibers
early on in the set
due to the instability implying greater
overall active tension early on
as reps approach failure this likely
would not matter
with regards to passive tension this is
the force generated when elastic
elements within muscles are stretched
when components within the extracellular
matrix and a molecule called titan found
within the sarcomere
are stretched passive force is generated
similar to active tension mechanosensors
are believed to detect this force
and subsequently initiate a signaling
cascade that ultimately results in
muscle hypertrophy
recent evidence suggests that titan may
alter its function during eccentric
contractions
such that it produces force throughout
this phase
again barbells dumbbells machines and
even bodyweight training
typically include an eccentric phase
additionally
depending on the working sarcomere
lengths of a particular muscle
passive tension from titan but also the
extracellular matrix
occurs when contracting at long muscle
lengths
for instance the sarcomeres within the
vastus muscles of the quadriceps
appear to be stretched at long muscle
lengths meaning passive tension can
effectively occur here
bear in mind this isn't the case for
every single muscle
the barbell back squat can work the
quadriceps at long muscle lengths
but so can the smith machine score or
another machine like the hack squat
to return to the overall point both
freeways and machines have the ability
to produce high amounts of mechanical
tension
likely explaining a big part of why they
can produce similar hypertrophy
