hey folks
dr mike israel here renaissance
periodization
strength training made simple video
number eight
how often should you train if strength
is your goal
so how many weekly sessions should you
do for movement
type which means for a squat or a press
or a pull
how many times a week should you train
every single one of those well
you can train again when two things
align first of all
you are recovered enough to successfully
add load to the bar
and complete your target reps which
means improve and strength by just a
little bit
if you're trying to train every day and
you're so beat up that after three days
you start to get weaker
you're training too often and but for
adjusting the volume per day
what you need to do is train not so
often so maybe train monday wednesday
friday and all of a sudden
every time you train you can recover
you're totally good and that last part
of recovery sort of point number two
there
is when the muscle is no longer sore and
those tend to go hand in hand
if the you've given enough time from
your last session for you to get nice
and strong again
stronger than last time by a little bit
and for you to make sure that you're no
longer sore
then you're good to go and anything more
frequent is probably a little bit too
frequent
now you could say okay but how frequent
is that well it really depends
a critical variable of how much you do
in every single session so for example
if you do three working sets per session
we'll see let's say you bench press or
do a horizontal press of some kind
three sets and then you go home you
might be able to do four sessions a week
of horizontal pressing
because you recover pretty often from
just three sets now on the other hand if
you do four sets of horizontal pressing
every time
that's a little bit more disruption it
takes longer to recover from
and then you might only be able to do
three sessions per week reliably when
you're not sore and stronger than last
time
so it really does depend on how much
volume you do now
there are a couple of caveats here
probably any if you're doing sessions
with
fewer than two to four sets per movement
group
it just you could be more economical and
efficient just by clustering them so if
you're doing like
uh and not to rag on the squad every day
approach it has its merits but if you're
squatting like one set every day
why don't you just go out with two sets
every other day and it'll probably spend
way less time warming up way less time
driving to the gym way less time
squatting and you would actually because
you know warm-ups take time
and then that way you you get really
good high quality training
rest and repeat so anything less than
two to four sets at a time
probably a little bit of a waste of your
time not the best use of your time
and then anything over eight sets per
session let's say eight sets of squats
i mean it's very unlikely you're lifting
at a high quality
at that point you're lifting probably
too light your movement technique is
probably degraded it's probably too much
so that should be split up so if you
have eight total sets of squats to do
per week
don't train once a week train at least
twice a week and maybe even three times
split up that volume so we know that
those
are kind of the tail ends where does
that put us as far as the average
person's ability to recovery
from those volumes in order to figure
out their frequency so given that we're
doing between
oh two and eight sets per session every
time how often
is the average person going to be
recovered how many sessions are i'm
going to do per movement pattern the
answer is probably about two to four
right so that's the most take-home part
of this video right here two to four
sets
sorry two to four times that you're
coming to the gym to train a specific
muscle group and or movement pattern so
if you're asking the question how often
should i bench press how often should i
squat
how often should i deadlift how often
should i row to get those groups
stronger per week the answer is two to
four now there are some exceptions if
you get super super strong that number
drops with deadlifts it drops to where
it's maybe
one hard session one lighter session
sometimes people can really lower the
volume
per session and squat six times a week
or bench six times a week nobody
deadlifts six times a week
but something like that you can edge in
on the margins but two to four
is really difficult to to critique and
it really works well so if you're
designing your own program
and you want to do a good job with a
training frequency that works anything
between two and
four movement pattern exposures per week
is a really really swell idea
you can do higher frequencies but they
have their own problems sometimes
they're not a sustainable
for the long term so a core good long
term program two to four times a week so
if you're benching twice a week
i think you're doing a great job if
you're reaching three times a week as
long as you're recovering on time
great you're mentioning four times a
week as long as your recovering time
great same thing applies to squatting
deadlifting and every other movement
fundamentally now
what about total sessions per week not
per movement pattern
but like how many times do you go to the
gym per week that
is really based on adherence a person's
ability to stick to the plan and it's
very different
for beginners intermediates in advanced
a couple considerations here so for
beginners really
my recommendation here humbly is two to
four sessions total per week that means
they might be going to the gym to train
for strength just monday and thursday
maybe monday wednesday friday
maybe monday tuesday thursday friday or
something four i wouldn't go much over
four
why you don't want to burn them out it's
really easy to burn out beginners and
they're really excited and they get not
excited because they're like this sucks
i didn't want to
ruin my whole body and ruin my whole
social life by training six times a week
you want to ignite the desire for more
so you're intentionally doing just
not enough right you want them to really
love the gym but they're like oh damn it
i could be training more like huh great
you know build that desire so once
they're intermediates they become
addicts to training and it launches
a whole wave of them getting stronger
for a really long time
another concern beginners make great
gains anyway so it's like oh yeah if you
train six days a week you'd be even
better better at what being a beginner
right beginners do great on two three
and four days a week so great that the
differences between that five and six
days a week is almost nothing
what is the risk of burnout versus the
benefit it just doesn't add up in most
cases
and most programs because well they
train two to four sessions a week
and we said earlier that the movements
should be done two to four times a week
that means
almost by definition every single time
they come to the gym it'll be
every single movement that they want to
get stronger so it'll be essentially
whole body training
makes perfect sense intermediates are
ready to do
three to six sessions a week why they
won't burn out anymore because they love
training you don't make it to the
intermediate stage unless you love
training at some level
they need more sessions to do each
movement justice okay if someone's like
look i really need to bring up my squat
and you're like okay but you have to do
your bench press and deadlift and all
the days
and you're only allowed to come to the
gym twice a week good god that's not a
very good way to bring up your squat
you want to bring up a squat you might
want to squat three four times a week
and fresh that means three to six total
sessions is the only thing that's going
to do your bench and deadlift justice
also by putting them at least
one time fresh themselves so they just
need more work and it's time to split it
up more
and this is when split programs become
more common uh
push legs pull something like that uh
upper lower
different kind of power lifting splits
where you might squat and bench
one day deadlift and accessory work the
next squat on bench one day double
accessory a little bit more complex no
longer just whole body training
whole body training can come in handy at
times but it's not the ideal template
anymore necessarily
lastly for advanced folks they should
probably be doing between five and ten
sessions a week why that's a lot of
sessions a week
so each movement needs to be first in a
session at least once a week you can't
say you're working on your deadlift if
your deadlift's always second or third
movement
because you're just not getting
maximally strong in it and not get the
best possible results so each movement
needs to come first at least
uh once which means you just need more
sessions to fill in
training only one or two movements per
session is now very common
because look when you're super advanced
you train
heavy squats and moderate bench you just
have nothing left after that
you can't do squat bench and deadlift as
an advanced all in the same workout
unless your workout's four hours long
and it has its own problems
because you just get so tired like a
beginner can do max squat
or super hard squatting super hard
benching super hard deadlifting and
still finish the session like so what's
next
intermediate not likely advanced highly
unlikely
so because you can only train one or two
hard you know
exercises per session three at the very
most
you have a lot of exercises to do over
the course of a week you just need more
sessions to fill them into
and lastly
double daily sessions can take you
to that 10 sessions total if desired so
what you might do is for example
you have on am where it's hard squatting
slightly easier posterior chain work and
then in the pm
you do moderate benching the next day
you do some deadlifts just
am the day after that so like a
wednesday you would do hard benching in
the am
and then moderate squatting and moderate
posterior chain work in the pm
so this kind of clustering means that
you have
lots of sessions through the week up to
10 if needed they're very short
they're very to the point and the
quality of training is high you don't
want to do this for beginners because
it'll drive them insane
now if you're not in that position if
you can only train
five or six sessions a week you probably
want to do emphasis the emphasis
training
where for some number of months you're
doing three
two or three hard squatting workouts
with some easier bench pressing and
really back burner deadlift work
then for a couple more months you put
your deadlift on the front burner and do
some easier stuff because you don't have
enough sessions to really prioritize
everything
so you cycle through which lifts you
prioritize and that way they come up
then they stay they come up then they
stay and over time
you get that much better folks give us
some thought we'll see you again
for the next video
