let's just knock out tip number two so
tip one is Arch and retract tip number
two is to take a pause at the chest
especially with slow Ecentric control
that will help you grow a ton so here
your chest is stuck out you bring down
just to around your nipple line pause
not caving over chest still big
everything stretched this will not feel
good this pause does not feel like a
rest it feels like holy my PEX are
going to blow up and then press to a
full lockout chest up and pause and
press as you do reps you'll get tempted
to collapse and Cave over so remind
yourself to keep your scapula tucked
reach your peex out to touch and press
reach your pecs out to touch pause and
press just like that
