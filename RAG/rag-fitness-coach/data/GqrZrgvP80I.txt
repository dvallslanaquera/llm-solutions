dr mike here
from renaissance periodization for
youtube which means you tube
izzy navaras
trevor fulbright
and me what
what do i hold up am i guiding this
workout nope i'm actually jumping in so
they're doing pull and it just so
happens our days align today and we have
folks to train later so normally i
trained earlier and i'm training and now
they're here so i'm going to jump in
with them we are going to do very likely
assisted pull-ups and then we are going
to do cable rows and then they are going
to do biceps and i'm going to do some
belts we're all going to be living
happily ever after
i purposefully chose pull because you
can only try so hard and back and i
don't have what it takes to hang him
with him for legs or push
let's start to work out so i can
embarrass myself
[Music]
that's the song that's in my head
because i know that's what you're gonna
put to the shit anyway
i was like doing full rom leg curls see
the electricals at dragon's lair on
video and i was like hitting the bottom
some guy's like you're really
inconsiderate i'm like it's a machine
made of steel yeah like if i can break
it with my body somebody needs their
money back right like my flesh and like
you're gonna break your car can you run
into your car and break your car no
sometimes i have clients apologize for
like right clanking
and they're like oh i'm sorry i'm like
you're not gonna you're gonna break way
before the machine does and when the
machine breaks jim owner gets his money
back is that warranty what the fuck yeah
i was kidding is he jesus christ
assisted pull-ups our first sets of 10
to 20 reps i'm trying to get my first
set at about 15 to 20. that's one of my
best sfrs with this exercise and the
gentleman will choose their own loading
paradigms i'm going to do two sets
to pretty close to all-out failure
probably all at failure
low volume i'm just starting a
motorcycle so i'd normally do more but
in order to hang with these guys and
have a little fun going to failure easy
principle is if you're going to go with
lower lower rars you want the same
amount of total fatigue you have to
decrease the number of steps you do that
in just like a mini equation
and uh yeah we're going to get it done
yeah they're gonna do significantly more
volume trevor is a volume king let's do
it
[Music]
[Music]
all right let's go to the court how many
are our boys
clearly
yeah easily i can't count that
approximately like squiggly equals
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
yep
[Music]
[Music]
yeah fuck yeah another one
let's go easy
up up
[Music]
move
christ
oh
guys demons have demons
those demons are in therapy for their
own demons
ugh
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
yep
[Music]
now we're talking
[Music]
yep
[Music]
yep
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
control
god damn
good shit man
[Music]
assistant pull-ups are done
cable rows they're going to be doing
flexion style cable rows gentle touch to
the tummy slash chest area big deep
stretch every single time you know i'm
shooting for a set of oh 15 to 25 reps
these are better for me for high reps
sfr these guys will choose their own
let's get into it
let's go
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
oh
my bank
call my chiropractor
mordecai
please leave all this in
[Music]
let's go
big arch at the top
good
go
yeah big stretch
chest stop
yeah there you go that was a perfect rep
[Music]
good
lean back a little at the top big chest
go go go go go go go come on you got it
come on trevor let's go
[Music]
come on
yep yep yep yep
[Music]
i thought you just started another one i
was like that's the worst attempt at a
rap i've ever seen just kind of leaned
into it like yeah
[Music]
[Music]
get it
go let's go
so it's tempting on this exercise to do
a few things one is of course not reach
your tummy every time it's not a
religious thing you have to reach your
tummy but it helps standardize the
motion so you can consider failure
failure otherwise you can just keep
making around you have no idea how many
reps to write in
another thing is leaning back super
super far you'll notice that we're
leaning but most of the leaning is
coming from fixing this and putting it
back to basically perpendicular to the
ground so lower back should be
perpendicular to the ground roughly
maybe a little bit forward to that and
we're doing a lot of arching which
requires muscle if you're leaning yeah
it's your hamstrings but at a huge
mechanical advantage gravity's helping
it makes the movement easier it doesn't
make the movement harder so yeah take a
big big stretch but if you come up just
go to where your tummy is perpendicular
to the ground and then the rest is back
yep
yep
three more
like a machine
big stretch
[Music]
last one coming up big stretch
quick
go
go finish finish chest up
go
go
oh
good stuff
good stuff
[Music]
go
[Music]
finish
[Music]
oh yeah all fucking day
go ah
good stuff
you even got a little toot out of here
[Music]
i'm gonna be doing shoulders free motion
laterals you guys seen that a trillion
times we'll put some video of me doing
it but the guys are going to be doing
easy bar curls it's i don't know if you
call it easy bar it's a weird ass bar
but it gives you a lot of really comfy
positions to grip you can grip inside if
you like it's really cool and you can
also flip to grip out here if you like
no wrong answers full range of motion
all the way to face back down controlly
centric uh
give these guys a shot to do some maya
reps so basically like whatever set
my rep match you get let's say 15 on the
first set no my reps put it down rest
normal a lot of time the other guy goes
whatever that number is you do as many
reps as you can
as many breaks as you need to get that
another two or three times
brutality becomes them
[Music]
come on go come on go
[Music]
yep
yep
go
two more
[Music]
