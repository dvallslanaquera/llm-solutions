hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization
hypertrophy concepts and tools lecture
number
30 training in a rush
let's take a look at why we're even
talking about this
ideally when training for hypertrophy
we'd always have the time
to actually train with a high raw
stimulus magnitude
and or a high stimulus to fatigue ratio
the best kind of training however
many people all the time and
some of us or sorry some people all the
time
all of us sometimes need to do a quick
hypertrophy session
we're time limited we can't take the
time
to do the most raw stimulus that we can
or even the best stimulus to fatigue
ratio or just that time constraint maybe
not all the time but definitely
sometimes and some people all the time
the next question we can ask is okay why
not just do regular sessions but only
finish them halfway through well here's
a really
easy example to refute that let's say
you have 30 minutes
to cause quadriceps hypertrophy okay you
got to get a quad workout and you only
have 30 minutes
just traveling or something like that
and something's better than nothing
okay let's say you say well i'm just
going to do my regular workout and i'll
just stop when i
have to go like i'll get as far through
it as i can and then i'll just stop at
30 minutes
if you are a four to 500 pound squatter
that means you may do one working set of
squats and then have to leave
because your warm up takes 20 or 25
minutes
you squat the bar it's got 135 you got
225 you squat 315 you squat 405 for one
or two and then you do
4 15 for sets and reps um that's kind of
crazy
right let's say it doesn't take you that
long to warm up but you only have 30
minutes
maybe it takes you 10 or 15 minutes to
warm up that's 10 or 15 minutes
gone to a non-stimulative training and
only another
20-25 minutes left in order to actually
do what you came to do which is
stimulate hypertrophy
not great now look if you have the time
if you have two hours
warming up and lifting your heaviest is
awesome it's the best way to grow
but if you can't do that maybe just
cutting a session short
isn't the right way to do it a really
quick stupid analogy because we're
always food analogies all the time
if you really know how to make an
awesome like
chef style french bread sandwich you you
take a french bread you cut it perfectly
you layer in mayo on the top may on the
bottom
mustard you make put a pickle down every
couple of centimeters you've got it all
worked out
you gotta count the pieces of ham you're
putting down all that stuff man that
shit tastes
great and when you're at home on a
weekend before some netflix you
if you take that 15 minutes you make the
shit out of one of those sandwiches and
oh my god ecstasy
if your friends are picking you up in
two minutes and you gotta smash some
quick food
because you gotta go to see a movie with
them and you're only eating after the
movie you wanna sit halfway through the
movie starving
you're not going to begin to make your
amazing french bread sandwich
and then when you're done wiping only
half the mayo and nothing else has been
assembled your friends are calling like
hey we're downstairs movie starts in 10
minutes
that's not a good strategy you have to
completely revamp your approach and say
okay
i'm making a sandwich right same thing
as i'm hypertrophy training
but i have this huge time constraint i'm
going to have to go about making a
sandwich
differently fundamentally because i want
a completed product
at the end just the same way when you're
rushed for time you're going to have to
apply
certain strategies differently that you
normally wouldn't apply
like that sandwich you might just take
out a thing like a spoonful of mayo on
white bread
squeeze those slices together open it up
throw some ham in there
cheese you don't even have time to reach
into the pickle jar clothes
throw into your mouth friends come pick
you up you have a great time success
but is that a good sandwich no i mean
it's fine
it does the job of making sure you're
not hungry
is it going to be the sandwich that's
amazing and awesome no it's not but you
don't have time for one of those
if you try to make the best sandwich
cutting off halfway through is a way
worse than half a sandwich because at
least you got some ham in there and you
got the mayo on both sides
if you just have half of french bread
with half the mayo on it and not even
any meat your friends call what are you
gonna do eat the bread with the mayo
people like hey what kind of sandwich is
that you're like
it's not really a sandwich at all what
the hell are you doing right
so you could say okay okay if we're
using these abbreviated hypertrophy
strategies
special strategies why don't we just use
them all the time
even if we have time that's the same
thing as being like why don't we make
dog shit ham sandwiches hastily
assembled with
whatever mayo and they're they taste
like crap you have all of the night to
watch netflix and eat sandwiches
and you make a crappy sandwich you eat
it you're like and then you watch
netflix that would suck
right so similarly question could be
phrased technically for hypertrophy why
not use the highest str stimulus to time
ratio strategies which is really what
this lecture is about
why not use them all the time because
most of the high stimulus
to time ratio strategies do not have the
best raw stimulus magnitudes
and they almost certainly don't have the
best stimulus to fatigue ratios
which means you're literally getting sub
quality training when you don't have to
be
if you ever use these time crunch
strategies when you're not time
crunched or use a lot of them at the
same time so
for example if you never have time
to stiff leg a deadlift heavy because
you're always using these strategies
you'll never benefit from heavy stuff
like a deadlift there will be a
categorical type of muscle building you
just never get
you could look at someone's hamstrings
years later and be like man your hams
are huge how'd you get that they're like
stuff like it else man i've been doing
you know up to about 365 for eight reps
nowadays and you're like
man uh and they're like would you do
them like no i just do supersets of like
you know 45 degree back raises to
hamstring curls i'm done with my
hamstring workout in 10 minutes
but how come my hams are that big and
they could tell you truthfully
there's nothing you can do in 10 minutes
that will maximize your hamstring growth
but if you only have 10 minutes that's
just halfway for a warm-up
for sniffling deadlifts and you'll get
zero hamstring growth
so basically you use these strategies
when you want a five on a one-to-ten
hypertrophy scale for the workout
and when just starting a normal workout
that would give you a 10
and getting halfway through it would
actually give you a one or a two that's
when these strategies work
so what do you do if you
or a client or anyone you're helping has
a very time constrained situation you
use
one of nine approaches to higher
stimulus to time ratio
training here it is number one
use mostly compounds obvious because
isolations
take usually a very similar amount of
time you know three sets of biceps and
rest right but if you do three sets of
pull downs not only do you get some
bicep growth and lat growth or sorry not
only you get some bicep growth
you get lack growth as well whereas if
you did bicep curls and then straight
arm pull down so you get sort of
both but it takes doubly as long right
so compounds for sure secondly you use
more general compounds than specific
compounds okay so technically speaking a
jm press or a close grip bench is a
compound exercise
but it hits most of your triceps not
really much of your chest so if you want
both triceps and chest one workout
you're gonna have to do something else
but if you do a medium grip bench press
then all of a sudden you get both
triceps and chest with one exercise
or the other example if you do wide grip
bench you have to do something else for
triceps but if you do close to medium
grip bench
you get a good measure of both so you
can conserve time that way so not only
are we doing compounds
we're doing compounds that hit a bunch
of different muscles
relatively evenly here's a trippy thing
if you
for example and this is again something
you normally wouldn't do
if you're training quads and glutes and
you literally have 10 minutes to do them
you're not going to do close stance
squats and leg presses you're going to
do wide stance sumo squats because
they're going to hit your glutes really
well
and your quads pretty well it's an even
balance but if you only did leg presses
for example and just started with leg
press and say i'll do my glutes later by
the time you get to glutes you have to
leave the gym
right so the level of specificity is
actually going to be lower you're going
to be doing more general training
because you usually have to cover
multiple muscle groups
all right next number three you're going
to use exercises that require
less warm-up time than others for
example lunges versus hip thrusts
warming up for lunges usually isn't that
hard you do a couple lunges body weight
wait around
stretch a little bit do a couple lunges
with the weight you're going to use
wait a little bit and then do work set
works that works that works out sweet
it's like five minutes maybe
what about hip thrusts well you got to
get a barbell sometimes you have to wait
for a barbell sometimes you don't
then you got to get a bench you got to
put it up unless your gym has a hip
thrust machine which is very rare
you get and here's the thing is lunges
you can do anywhere especially with
dumbbells
hip thrust machine might be taken so
there's another problem let's say you
don't have one you got to set up a bench
then you got to set up a bar then you
got to put 45s in that bar and a lot of
people when they learn to hit thrust
properly
they can actually hit thrust a lot and
that means you have to warm up because
you don't just go right to 585 or
something like that
so let's say you're hip thrusting with
405 which many people can do
135 225 350 so on and so forth holy holy
crap
15 minutes later you are with you know
doing your last set of three at 3 15
it's not even your first work set four
or five
you've run out of time or to compare it
more realistically someone who did the
lunges instead
they're already in 80 reps of lunges and
they're done training their glutes
right another one is something like
push-ups
weighted push-ups versus barbell bench
and as much as it pains to admit this
machines come in really handy here a
selectorized leg press machine where you
just
click and there it goes even if it's not
the best sfr machine for you
because the plate loaded one could be
better it's just so much faster
you don't have to load the plates and
you can be in and boom boom boom get
what you need and get out
right a chest press machine versus a
barbell bench
especially versus dumbbells because
you've got to put them down pick them
back up so on and so forth right
so sometimes warm up times and
transition times from set to set
rep to rep etc you want to minimize
those again notice
there are raw stimulus magnitudes not
that great for a lot of these things the
stimulus fatigue ratio may be not that
great for a lot of these things
but it has to be something that's traded
off for a much
total stimulus you get from being able
to squish it in
the raw stimulus magnitude for rep for
rep or set for set isn't as good
but you get so many more reps and sets
in with these faster strategies
the total stimulus through the session
is actually higher than if you try to do
your best
took too much time next one lighter
loading ranges
one of the reasons for this probably the
biggest one
is the fact that with lighter loading
ranges you don't have to warm up as much
right
if you're doing uh walking lunges with
just 30 pound dumbbells it takes like
three minutes to warm up for that
but if you're going to be squatting or
you know
hundreds of pounds it takes a long time
to warm up for that even if let's say
exercise for exercise you're going to be
lunging with the 80s you don't just jump
to the 80s
that's at least one or two more warm-up
sets for if you just do the 30s
right a bench press you do 135 for super
high reps that's a couple warm-ups
but if you do 275 for lower wraps that's
more warm-ups and it just takes more
time
right and you absolutely here's a huge
point
you do not want to rush your warm-up
ever
that is exactly how you get hurt so
if you have heavy weight to lift and
you're in a rush
untenable situation mutually exclusive
you've got heavy weight to lift and five
to ten rep range
you will not be in a rush you're going
to cancel or postpone your plans
and take your sweet fucking time but if
you
can't cancel or postpone the plans
you've got to get the hypertrophy work
in
sets of 10 to 20 and a lot of times 20
to 30.
much better because they don't take as
much time and if you rush the war up a
little bit with those you're probably
not getting hurt you rush the warm up
even a little bit
with heavy weights you could be in
trouble number five huge one
antagonist supersets instead of doing
three sets of bench
waiting between each set and after and
doing three sets of pull downs
what you can do is bench pull down bench
pull down match pull down bench with
like 30 seconds between
each one of them a lot of high quality
work in a very short time
now is it the highest per set per repro
stimulus magnitude no wait
best stimulus to fatigue ratio not even
close but as of how much
actual total work and total stimulus you
can smash in a very short time
awesome so give that a shot right if
you're really in a rush
it becomes difficult to explain to
yourself like uh imagine aliens came
down and watched you in the gym
and you said you only had a session to
hit your whole lower body in uh
30 minutes and they watched you do a set
of squats and then rest for three
minutes
now what do you think they'd ask they
have no idea about lifting or anything
they're just really smart they'd be like
he said he was rushing i guess why is he
waiting for three minutes you're like um
well because he's stupid that's what it
is right
so instead of doing squats and waiting
for three minutes you might be able to
do some squats wait a minute or so
do some leg curls which don't tax your
whole system a ton
after you've done leg curls wait a
minute or two and do squats again that
way you get basically
get double the work not as high quality
of work but double the work in the same
amount of time and you really are using
the time as well as possible so
if you say you're in a rush but then you
spend a lot of time waiting for well i
gotta take my three minutes rest
bullshit right antagonist supersets
great great way to do it
especially with compound movements time
saving training methods
maya reps right you get bicep let's say
you've got time to do cable bicep curls
you've already trained all your other
muscles great but like oh
i got to get out of here the gym closes
in five minutes what are you gonna do
straight sets and wait three minutes
between you get one and a half sets done
but if you do my reps you do in five
minutes
nuclear annihilation to your biceps holy
shit five minutes you'll be leaving the
gym in four minutes but get me the fuck
out of here thank god that
you know i don't have to wait another
thank god the gym's not open longer i'm
like getting ready to leave you're doing
the last maya representing like please
kick me out
right so now are my reps always the best
answer no they're not
absolutely there's some trade-offs and
downsides there especially if you use
them super consistently but every now
and again they're a great way to just
limit rest times and still get a great
uh workout
super sets right as opposed to doing
skull pressures and then later doing
cross script bench as their own exercise
which has raw stimulus magnitude
advantages
right you do a skull crusher superset to
a close group bench
and you smash a lot of stimulus into
much shorter time drop sets
great for this perspective right instead
of doing three by you know three by ten
leg press
do you know ten leg presses close to
failure whatever on your first set
have some friends peel off some plates
do another set of 10 ish
peel off another plate another set of 10
to 20 or something you'll fall off that
leg press
and it'll be awesome it'll be three
minutes of work for a
roughly you know maybe 80 percent of the
stimulus that you would get
from what otherwise take 10 minutes
right now notice
if you aren't time constrained why the
hell would you do something that's only
80 stimulative to what it could be you
wouldn't so don't
but if you're really that time
constrained it's a really good idea to
try something like that
next cycle your volumes less or not at
all especially if you're consistently
constrained on time so for example
if someone could only train for 45
minutes at a time
are they going to be doing four sets per
session beginning of the mesocycle
and 16 sets per session at the end no
but where the hell are you going to stop
16 sets
so what they actually would probably do
is start
more like at eight sets per session at
the beginning of their meso
and go up to only 12 sets per session at
the end both of them are within that 45
minute window
sessions take a little bit shorter at
the beginning a little bit longer at the
end or
very time constrained they just start at
10 and end at 10 or start at 6 and end
at 6 and then they use
other loading variation and represent
reserve variation
in order to potentiate gains as opposed
to altering volumes like in an ideal
world
is traveling from lower volumes to
higher volumes better
of course right but sometimes you don't
have time for that
you what you definitely don't want to do
is be super constrained consistently
like i only have 45 minutes a day to
work out
and then like half your message cycle
you spend sitting around in your
training be like man i have four cents
today i guess i'm done at 20 minutes
and then the other half of your mother's
life will be like oh shit i gotta go i
gotta get all these sets in and they're
all dog shit
lower quality sets bring up your sets
earlier in the meso break down your sets
later
and use other ways of doing it and
people can say
well you know volume progression is
better why don't we do it because you
just don't have time to do
the fundamental problem isn't the fact
that we're not doing volume progression
that's the adjustment we made the
fundamental problem is we don't have
enough time
that's it right number eight
use lower eps in reserve again you are
trying to cause as much disruption as
much hypertrophy in a very short amount
of time as you can why the hell
would you leave tons of reps in the tank
right getting from
three ir to zero rer takes well like
three to six seconds
and it magnifies your hypertrophy
significantly
so why would you not do it you could say
well it causes a lot of fatigue
okay but you have so little time to
train your mrv is almost never going to
be hit
right if you train four times a week for
45 minutes and you're probably like you
can do all the volume you want that you
can squeeze into 45 minutes
and basically train everything almost to
failure or to failure and not worry
about excessive cumulative fatigue
you would worry about that if you were
able to train due diligence hour and a
half
per day six days a week yeah you can get
into serious trouble start a 3r
but if you train very very short or if
it's an exceptional day let's say you're
traveling
and you've got to get a workout and
you're you get out of the airport and go
to a gym and you gotta be back in three
hours
basically you have one hour to work out
are you gonna be doing leaving reps in
the tank
probably not every set is probably going
to be close to failure or right at
failure
then you would zap the shit out of
yourself do some maya reps drop sets
compound alternating supersets
and you come back on the airplane just
like this for the next flight
great you did a really good job with the
time you had
that's the ticket lastly again
if you are in that problem with number
seven
where you're consistently short on time
you want to use distinct specialization
phases more often here's what i mean by
that
some people have the luxury of being
able to grow their chest and back
roughly evenly at the same time
because they have the time in the week
to train their back between mev and mrv
and their chest between mvv and mrv
right and so long as they're not over
systemic fatigue
threshold they can grow both really
really well you on the other hand may
only be able to train whatever 45
minutes four days a week
you can either have really good back
training or really good chest training
or if you do both training that is under
maintenance volume or like
under minimum effective volume for both
that's stupid that's
backwards right so
if that's the case what you probably
want to do
is take your back and put it on me v.m
rv really good training and for several
months maybe a block
keep your chest at maintenance volume
then switch
the other way around back on the back
burner maintenance volume
chest minimum effective volume to
maximum recoverable one grows one stays
one
grows one stays and so on and so forth
and someone could say well why don't you
grow both at the same time because if
you try
both get a crappy workout and both might
be at their mevs or under
and get really really bad gains right
give that some thought so if you're
training in a rush or you have lots of
clients the trainer rush which is very
likely
give these ideas some thought there's
nine you don't have to use them all
but feel free to sort of a la carte
style use all the ones you need
to take the amount of work that you're
putting into a small session and
magnify it's not going to raise its raw
stimulus magnitude per second per rep
sorry probably going to lower it it's
probably not great diminished fatigue
ratio but when you're very time
constrained
you have to do your best for that given
situation
folks thank you so much see you next
