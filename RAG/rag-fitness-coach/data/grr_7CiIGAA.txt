stress is a huge fatigue booster and
motivation killer if you have cardio
that you absolutely hate it's just like
planning to fail after seven weeks of
fat loss you're like I quit and everyone
at work's like oh no why like I just had
done enough cardio to where I don't ever
want to do cardio ever again I've
retired from cardio but if you have a
cardio modality let's say playing
basketball with your friends or uh you
know having friends at all in my case
then if you like that or let's say you
put on a sweet podcast and go to the gym
and just incline walk if you like the
cardio or at least hate it the least
you're more likely to receive less
stress from it you're more likely to be
adherent and actually do it and then
it's all good things all the way down
