welcome back to the contest prep series
in this video i am now eight weeks out
i wanted to discuss a few things today
including how prep has made it harder to
socialize and eat out
give a brief update on my phd give an
update on my prep
next i want to discuss my plans to use
nicotine gum during last part of prep
and finally i wanted to discuss my plans
for the final message cycle of prep
so first up
how prep has made it hard socialize and
eat out
when you listen to bollywood's talk
about contest prep one thing you'll
often hear is how contest prep makes it
harder to eat out
and
for the most part during this prep i
haven't really experienced this that
much because i've been able to diet on
pretty high calories
and because i started so early i was
able to stay quite sociable as far as
eating went for the majority of my prep
in fact for
most of my prep i want to say
first 10 to 15 weeks of cutting total
i was on an average of around 34 or 3
500 calories per day and i was still
losing around a kilogram a week
and obviously when you're dieting on
calories that high
eating out really isn't that much of a
concern you can just have
a comfortable meal out once a day
perhaps and still be within your
calories
but now that hunger has become more of
an issue and
calories have dropped so for reference i
am now down to around
2700 calories on average um per day
and so now that calories have dropped
and my hunger's increased it's become
much more difficult to eat out and still
be satiated
so now that i'm around seven or eight
weeks out
i'm at a point where
if i want to eat out and have
a reasonable meal
i am going to have to make the decision
between
going over my calories and thus
risk
slower progress on my prep and not being
ready on time
or going hungry a fair amount and
risking adherence that way
and so
the frequency of my
sociable eating so stuff like going out
for meals with friends and so forth
that has slowed down quite a bit and
i think for now eating out once a week
maybe twice a week
seems to be about as much as i should
should try and do
um
and that sort of goes back to what a lot
of bodybuilders talk about where contest
prep
can make your relationships with others
suffer a little bit
because
contest prep is
restricting
you don't get to eat all the food you
want you
need to train pretty consistently
oftentimes people do cardio and or steps
to increase their energy expenditure and
overall the whole of contest prep is
pretty time-consuming and
places a lot of restrictions on what you
can do like your sleep needs to be
pretty good you can't really afford to
be
very stressed out you have to be
relaxing most of the time
and so overall contest prep if you want
to do well
does place a lot of restrictions on what
you can do
and so for me now prep has made it
harder to socialize and eat out than
ever before
i'm still making efforts and i think you
can find a balance between
say
prep and still having some degree of
social life
but i think the deeper you get into prep
and the closer you get to
the more of a back seat that's going to
have to take
but it needs to be done with the
awareness that
early on prep
you can still be quite sociable
and b
once prep is over and you've competed
and your competitive season is over
i think it
would be a good idea for you to spend
more time with your
friends loved ones etc
on purpose to sort of make up for that
lost time um but overall i think
prep can definitely make relationships
a bit more difficult
anyways that's about it as far as how
prep has made it hard socialize and eat
out for me
um
one strategy i found useful is to
have certain days where
i only eat the most satiating and
protein-heavy options of my diet so i
only have the protein and the vegetables
mostly and then i can afford to have
maybe around a thousand calories left
over for a meal out and that can help
but otherwise careful planning and stuff
like that has been
critical in allowing me to still be
sociable
next up i want to briefly give an update
on my phd and that's how that's going
i don't really talk about my phd all
that much
publicly um for a few reasons one of
them was for this first year i've never
been doing my phd for a year of my phd i
haven't been able to get much work done
and that's mostly on account of
coronavirus so in the uk coronavirus at
my university has meant there has been
basically
no way for me to do any experimentation
so there's been no way for me to get
people into the labs and have them do
say for example a partial range of
motion intervention versus a full range
of motion intervention and see how that
impacts muscle growth across a program
and overall that's just meant that
progress on my phd itself has been
fairly slow which is why i haven't
talked about that much
but now that coronavirus in the uk at
least is becoming less of an issue and
experimentation should be able to resume
pretty shortly
i've made a lot of progress on my phd in
the past few weeks
i think what's helped the most with all
this was of course the coronavirus
situation slowly coming to an end
but also since i came back from holidays
i've implemented a bit more of a
schedule
and that's made it
a lot more
easy let's say a lot easier to get some
work on my phd having certain times of
the week be dedicated to phd work
certain times dedicated coaching work
certain times dedicated to editing and
so forth
and so
i have now submitted ethics or an ethics
application for my studies that's
basically just when you're planning out
some studies and
the university needs to make sure that
your studies are
well thought through the risks have been
assessed
there are no ethical issues or potential
complications with your study that
haven't been considered and so forth and
so essentially they give you the
green card to go ahead and do your study
so i've submitted the application now
and typically you're back within a month
or two and once i hear back from them
and hopefully it gets accepted i can
begin data collection and begin getting
people into the labs
to
put them through a program with either
partial range of motion or full range of
motion and then start collecting that
data
on muscle hypertrophy muscle strength
and then go from there besides that i've
also submitted my transfer report a
transfer is essentially when
in my case
i officially registered for
a masters in philosophy or enfield
with possibility of transfer to a phd so
officially if i were to just do my
studies and so forth without doing
anything else
i would graduate with an mfil or master
philosophy
but if your project is of sufficient
quality and represents a an original
contribution to knowledge
you can then apply for a transfer to a
phd instead
to essentially make your degree
become a phd
and so that's what i've been writing up
as well and that's around 10 to 20 000
words and i recently finished writing
that up and i've submitted it
uh actually no i haven't submitted it
yet but i plan on submitting it quite
soon and so essentially what i'm trying
to say is i've got a lot of progress
done on my phd in the past few weeks
and from the looks of it i think i
should be able to finish the phd
entirely
in 2022 which would be exciting because
that'll be
around two years after i started and
also it means i'll be graduating when
i'm 22 and it'll just be exciting to see
results of the phd overall um
i think it'll be
a very useful contribution to literature
especially for practitioners where the
idea of range of motion is definitely
applicable to
a lot of people's training because a lot
of people care about hypertrophy um
and so knowing what the relationship
between range of motion and muscle
apathy is
that's going to be a lot more helpful um
and my studies should be able to
contribute to that knowledge and
well no project nope as i said on in my
instagram caption recently while no phd
project is ever going to answer a
question entirely
my phd project should
make a significant and meaningful
contribution to answering this question
of range of motion and muscle growth
anyways that's about it as far as phd
goes now i wanted to give a quick update
on my prep
prep has been hard i'm not even gonna
lie i made a post about this on
instagram um
it's been getting quite challenging
i am
getting pretty hungry i'm not so hungry
that i ever seriously consider
going beyond my macros or like having a
binge or anything
but it's getting quite challenging and
so far as
i consistently feel hungry um
i still know that i'll finish prep
pretty successfully like i have no doubt
that i'll
stick it through till the end and make
it to that stage being pretty lean
um
but it is getting challenging and i can
see why people say call this prep is
hard and unsustainable
compared to other sports i've competed
in so far i think bodybuilding
is probably the hardest one i've
competed in uh basketball in football in
um
powerlifting
and so far
just on a chronic level
bodybuilding has been the most
challenging um
so yeah it's kind of kicking my ass but
i still enjoyed it um
but at the same time as i said in a
previous video
very much looking forward to the all
season if only because it makes it
easier to be sociable it gives you more
of a
training to life balance or sport to
life balance
but at the same time i will say
prep has forced me to
really dedicate my attention towards
other areas of my life
if the only thing i had in life right
now was prep
all of my attention would be towards
hunger and how i feel terrible at times
and tired and so forth and so forth but
the fact that i've been able to do phd
work the fact that i've been coaching
still the fact that i've still tried to
be sociable if i hadn't had all those
things and been able to focus on them
prep would have been a lot harder and i
think
that's one of the lessons
that you can take from
a successful contest prep
is how to have balance in life and
pursue multiple goals and areas at once
without
losing balance i suppose
so yeah prep has been hard it's been
kicking my ass
um
i have
seven weeks as of this recording to go
i am around
93 kilograms in the morning now which is
i believe around 206 pounds which is a
very light for me i'm in this light in a
few years now
um
but i think
i'll end contest prep around 88 to 90
kilograms at this point
i think i have a bit more fat to lose
than expected
while i'm pretty lean
all around now i still have some fat to
lose in my
hamstrings and glute area
and overall just a bit more fat overall
to lose
so it'll be a lot longer but i think i
can make it and i'm looking forward to
that that post-show
food and training and getting back to a
more normal life as well hopefully being
able to continue
applying some of the lessons and habits
i've learned throughout this prep with
phd work with
being consistent with paying attention
to details
um but at the same time with a renewed
appreciation for what it's like to be in
the offseason
to have more of a balanced lifestyle and
that sort of thing
anyways that about wraps up the prep
update
though on a similar note i wanted to
discuss my plans to use nicotine gum
during the last part of prep
this is something i've recently
considered because a friend of mine ben
um
messaged me about it um
i checked back on some old strong by
science podcasts where greg knuckles
spoke about it and eric traxler as well
and looked into it a little bit and
from what i understand it can be
effective in suppressing appetite in the
short term but then as soon as you
discontinue usage it then causes a
rebound in appetite past previous levels
and while this means that for
long-term weight loss
it's probably not very good because you
don't really want a drug that has
potentially negative health effects
um
and that causes a rebound in appetite
after
discontinuation
um that doesn't sound very good but then
for context prep where the goal isn't a
long-term reduction weight in
weight it's more so just temporary
weight loss and
fat loss with less of a concern for way
to regain afterwards if anything you
want to regain some of that weight
afterwards uh in this case i think
nicotine gun can make some sense
and in my case i plan on using it for
perhaps the last
three and a half four weeks of prep i've
never used nicotine and i've never
gotten into smoking so i should be quite
naive and sensitive to the effects of
nicotine
as far as the health effects go as far
as i understand
a lot of the negative health effects of
smoking for example
aren't present with simple nicotine gum
which is why it's recommended as one of
the
tools to use
when coming off or
stopping smoking
um
so yeah the plans to use nicotine gum a
few times a day
during the last month or so of contest
prep
from what i understand the half-life of
it is about two hours which means you
can use it
with relatively little detriment to your
sleep relatively late in the day and so
i plan on using it maybe two or three
times a day for the last month of prep
and that should help with appetite
suppression and overall energy which at
this point i think i need overall energy
a little bit more than appetite
suppression i can deal without eating
much
but i'm struggling to get all my steps
in for example and training is feeling a
bit
hard to say the least
so yeah those are my plans to use
nicotine gum in the last month of
training it's fairly cheap which is also
good um
the good news is also at this point
because i've dropped calories fairly
recently and i've seen very good results
from it i'm averaging around 2700
calories per day as i mentioned
i shouldn't need to drop calories again
before show day which is very nice and
so i have around
40 days of cutting left in this prep and
around 10 days of maintenance which is
mostly either deloading or peaking for
the actual show or me or mock peeking
for a photo shoot
so
realistically i don't think that should
be too much of an issue i should be able
to make it through just fine
finally i want to discuss my plans for
the final mesocycle of prep
so i am currently in week two of this
metacycle and there are five weeks four
of which an accumulation phase and one
of which is
a dealer week
so i've got three weeks left now of this
motorcycle and then i have four weeks
until my show
the plan for last minute cycle is
slightly different from my usual cycles
for a few reasons
first i'll actually be competing at the
end of the fourth week which means my
accumulation is only going to last
around
three to three and a half weeks and then
the last half a week to a week before
the show
is going to be spent peaking for my show
and so training is going to have to be
modified and nutritionally i'm going to
be doing more carbs making sure i peek
for the show
that's the first reason second reason is
because it's the last cycle before the
show
injury prevention is a pretty major
concern
whilst don't retain muscle mass and so
tempo is likely going to slow down a
little bit repetitions are going to be a
bit higher overall
and
more machines are going to be used
machines and potentially cables anything
that reduces injury risk slightly
potentially
machines probably reduce injury risk
slightly because
they don't allow for as large a
technique deviation
think about a barbell squat because the
weight isn't attached anywhere
you know there's potential for the board
to go forward backwards for you to fall
over etc etc with a machine there's only
much of a range of motion it's able to
go through uh so much back and forth
movement there's that the machine is
capable of and so overall the acute
injury risk is probably slightly lower
and so for this last motorcycle higher
reps slower tempos more machine based
work
and
only a three to three and a half week
accumulation phase is what's going to
happen
finally the last
change i'll make for this last minute
cycle
is i want to incorporate blood flow
restriction training or occlusion
training essentially that's training
where you
wrap
your limbs
or occlude blood flow
to those limbs
sorry not to those limbs away from those
limbs
so for example if you're occluding your
legs during leg extensions you would be
wrapping the top of your thigh
so that the blood flow away from your
quads
is restricted but the blood flow towards
your quads
is still able to flow just fine
um
and the reason i am planning on using
occlusion training during this last
motorcycle is
twofold mostly um
actually threefold sorry first reason is
actually fourfold wow i'm surprising
even myself
first reason would be to break the
monology of training i've been training
pretty hard during this contest prep
overall and if you keep doing the same
straight sets over and over again on the
same exercises eventually
psychologically it gets quite hard to
manage and so after a few minutes
mesocycles of hard training i'm
personally a fan of implementing
some intensity techniques whether that's
supersets drop sets or giant sets mile
wraps
or bfr for example that's the first
reason the second reason is bf4 allows
you to use pretty light loads and still
get a good hepatitis stimulus and so as
i said before
lighter weights slash higher reps might
be a bit better for injury prevention
and so that's one more reason to use it
in this last minute cycle where injury
is a bit more likely when you have lower
calories and or leaner
then the third reason is man
if i'm this lean i may as well make use
of it for some cool videos and some cool
pictures by doing bfr
when you do bfr you get a pretty nice
pump
and i don't do bfrl often because it's
quite painful
and
let's be honest in my offseason i wasn't
that lean and so we even went to bfr it
just didn't do that much visually at
least
um
and so not um as least i'll ever be i
really want to do it and see what it
actually looks like with good lighting
and like some nice curls what have you
it's more of a vanity thing or like a
social media thing as well where getting
some nice pictures doesn't hurt
and then
finally i think that was all four
reasons i said three reasons but um
i think i mentioned all four in the
process of saying those three reasons
but yeah so i'm implementing bfr i'm
using lighter weights doing high rep
ranges
and overall i'm looking forward to this
last minutes like look training
um
i think
i roughly timed my prep properly
initially i thought i might be starting
too early
but as it turns out i think i started it
roughly on time will i have the best
conditioning i could possibly get
probably not
but for a first time competitor i think
my conditioning will be quite
appropriate
and i'm
very curious to see how i'll perform at
the show
because
i have
no real idea what to expect on one hand
it's a natural bodybuilding show
natural bodybuilding isn't that popular
over sport if you can call it a sport
um
and
it's a wnbf show and the wnbf isn't that
popular in the uk yet i think
but then
on the other hand it is a
it is nationals essentially it's a
national level show because there were
no qualifying shows this year for wnbf
in the uk because of covid it is
literally nationals in the uk so part of
me thinks competition is going to be
quite
challenging
um
furthermore i'm competing in the open
class and so
you know for a first time competing in
the open class in a show that's
essentially nationals
i can't help it one would expect and so
i'm
excited but also a bit
nervous to see how it's gonna unfold
anyways that wraps up this video if you
