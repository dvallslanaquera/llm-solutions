hey guys so
i decided to film my squat and bench
workout
from last night i trained at the
university
dalhousie gym so it was a nice change of
scenery
i trained here for about a year and it
was nice to get back and see some people
that i hadn't seen in a while
so i kicked it off with high bar squats
uh i did five sets of
eight with what was supposed to be 65
of my one rep max i might have slightly
underestimated that because these sets
moved really quickly or these reps moved
really quickly
and in that first set i did 10 reps i i
thought that i was supposed to do
or at least i was had planned to do
10 rep sets but turns out i squeezed in
an extra couple reps there that weren't
actually
in the plan which is fine i also just
very recently started using my niece
leaves again
which actually just make a huge
difference
for me especially in
in getting out of the hole and so yeah
that felt great
and so i finished off uh my lower body
session with
two sets of 50 walking lunges so
that's 25 reps per leg
um and this was basically four trips
down and back across the
gym
and if you haven't done any sort of high
rep work like this in a while for your
lower body it
feels like hell and i as disgusting as
it is i
actually puked in my mouth a little bit
and
i could uh taste it coming up which is
obviously not the goal but if it does
happen then
you know you know you're pushing it
uh so then i moved on to
bench press uh and robin was just great
in this session
um you'll see here that for whatever
reason
these sets felt heavy to me mentally
but um the bar speed was really fast and
so i was supposed to do triples with
these six sets of three with
uh 85 percent of my one rep max and
using 365
as my one rep max it would come out to
be 310 pounds
and i was feeling feeling good at the
start so i moved it up to
315 and it just felt heavy in my hands
for whatever reason
so i brought it back to 295 and banged
out an easy
triple with that and then after i had
sort of
built up that confidence
then i you know i went back to uh
3 15 and i did six sets of three
with that i believe the first one of
which you'll see here
so it was one of those sort of roller
coaster workouts where it
felt really good and then it started to
feel crappy and then i sort of came out
of it and
pulled through at the end
and yeah these reps are pretty smooth
i think on instagram a couple of people
said that my butt isn't on the bench
kind of might look like that from
certain angles but
it is always in contact it's just the
fact that i have a
big arch and i wear shorts so you can't
really see it
and then i just finished off this
workout with four sets of
10 over head
cable triceps extensions
and basically my program has just been
structured that
i have been incorporating some of the
power lifting movements in there again
now that my back is
feeling a lot better and i'll have a
full day dedicated to
back and bicep hypertrophy and for
things like shoulders triceps and chest
i'll usually just
add in things that would be missing from
the power lifts
and do them in more of a hypertrophy rep
range we'll say
at the end of the workout so that's it
guys that was my workout thank you very
