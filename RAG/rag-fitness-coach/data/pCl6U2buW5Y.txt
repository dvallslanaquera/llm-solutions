everything right here
give it up jake
fucking animal
[Music]
what's up guys i'm here with my friend
jimmy you actually saw one of his other
buddies in another one of our videos
darion hill maybe you could put a
flashback in there that what about 315.
yeah he's got 315. that was light as
shit
he just won his pro card at junior usa
the junior usa show
a few weeks ago and his number one goal
in the offseason is to make his legs a
little bigger
so he's coming to train with another pro
and rp doc mike to see what he can do
hey what was it like starring in beverly
hills top
today is my more hamstring focus day we
still have a lot of quad in this
exercise or in this session because
uh hamstrings have a pretty low mrb so
we're doing straight leg dowels first
that way especially as he's massing up
he's getting a lot of lower back pumps
lactate
and his lower back uh this will knock
these out first so he's not trying to do
them after quads
whereas a shit's gonna lack in his lower
back there's no way he'll do these
chest stop
[Music]
good cast stop big chest
hips back yeah there you go
nice and slow back back push
yes two more big chest control
and last one big chest hamstrings not
letting your lower back bigger
bottom bigger use the hamstrings big
chest
much better so as if you're gonna do
another one just stop slow
slow slow slow slow slow and drop that's
it
good oh shit good shit oh yeah i'm heavy
says i don't really go above like six
to seven reps because this is a really
taxing movement for the erectors for
most people
and they just take over after a while so
they get really fatigued and
you take attention off the hamstrings
anyway because you start going like this
so i just seven to eight whatever
so we'll go heavy enough to where that's
our limiting factors our hamstrings and
not our lower back
nice and controlled jared
good slow
[Music]
big chest there you go
[Applause]
[Music]
oh yeah control
[Music]
[Applause]
now settle in big chest the whole time
but back
slow beautiful
[Music]
big chest yes
flawless slow control
good couple more big chest big chest
slow
one more one top quality only
lower back slow hips hips slow up
and as if you're going to do another one
just got to be perfect big chest slow
just stop chest up chest up yes slow
that's it good shit
good shit good shit
you peaked for a show and you didn't
train very much
and you took pretty long you just told
me you trained legs one time since your
show
if you just add in a shit ton of volume
right away you get way too sore over
each too soon
the rest of your training for the next
few weeks would be like shit until you
realize i need a fucking break
so you ease in with the volume so next
week if you do this again this exact
same session let's say
on the exact same day you can maybe add
a set here
or beat your sets by one rep or go out
five pounds or some combination of the
two
same thing on everything else
[Music]
we're gonna be doing the arsenal
pendulum squat i probably have two to
three sets here it depends on
how i'm feeling like i said i just came
off the d-load he just came off a show
prep
and uh a contest so
two three sets but this is our first
quad exercise then we have a
leg press mile rep and i haven't decided
if i'm gonna put hamstring curls in yet
probably not i just fucked myself pretty
hard on those hip hinges
but uh this should be pretty good all
the way hips open
so yeah see what your toes are so to
produce the most force through your
quads
you want to stack your joints so
whenever you valgus inward
you actually aren't stacking your knee
over your ankle or your hip over your
knee
so you want everything to be stacked so
if your toes are pointed this way your
knees should point that way too
so instead of toes here and knees kind
of inward on my big toe
in my my big toe stack your joints
you'll feel a lot more in the quads
yes pushing hips forward at the bottom
boom up
this will be a work set okay nice and
slow
nice and controlled all the way down
we got three cues for this exercise and
it translates to a lot of quad movements
cue number one is make sure you stay
straight
yeah that can mean chest up but just
generally don't let the machine punk you
out early around your back so nice
enough right sometimes chest up is a
good cue
cue number two is heels make sure that
your whole foot is producing pressure
not just your toes it's easy to get on
your toes here not so great for the
knees
not great for stability not great for a
lot of generating of power through the
quads
cue number three is full depth under
slow and controlled get all the way down
as long as you're nice and rigid in the
upper body your heels
and toes are generating power and you go
super deep you will have quads
starting to grow what those are
beautiful let's go
hips open right here
come in watch
let's go
