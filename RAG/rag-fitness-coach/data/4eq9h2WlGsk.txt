Does the high bar back squat and conventional deadlift carry over to one another? This study  
gives us an idea. 25 men with three years average training experience trained the squat only or  
deadlift only, for three times per week for six weeks. The program is on screen. The squat only  
group increased their squat one rep max by 15.2%  and their deadlift one-rep max  
by 5.7%. The deadlift only group increased their squat one-rep max by 6.7% and their  
deadlift one-rep max by 17.7%. So, even 
in individuals with a fair degree of experience,  
the squat and deadlift have a fairly decent carryover. Squat only training meaningfully  
increased deadlift strength, and deadlift only training meaningfully increase squat strength too.
