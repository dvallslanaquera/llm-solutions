oh
zabon first don't eat food
the stories you've heard are all true
fresh
foamy root beer is their meal and their
brew
this is an allegory for alcoholism
[Music]
hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
we uh on occasion like to read our
comments that you guys leave we actually
read all the comments pretty much and
one of you fine folks who was um made a
suggestion that uh scott video guy and i
were like oh that's not a terrible idea
um you wanted me to read a children's
book
with my commentary scots laughing in the
background
so how was i gonna let you guys down
after all all of youtube is for you the
viewer and uh here we go so i will read
a children's book i believe targeted at
first graders
online for free
and uh i will commentate on various
things and you guys can read along with
me it'll be uh right i guess right here
uh and uh let's get into it all right
let's see what we can learn
so oh by the way uh
bruce larkin
author of this book wonderful book great
for first graders
all this is satire my commentary is
going to be completely insane so please
uh take no offense all right
so the book is called the big red
subwoofer
fine and it's uh by larkin's little
readers uh publishing company i guess or
book series and the story is by bruce
larkin let's see all right so that's
intro page
some technical details here a story by
bruce larkin and uh
you know to see who illustrated this
book
that's trippy and and for you uh
for you intellectual puzzle tease liking
folks it says at the bottom of this page
don't forget to look for the mystery
jackalope so whatever you do
make sure to stay tuned for the
jackalope i'll probably fucking forget
halfway through this shit all right
let's see what the fuck our children are
reading to become the leaders of
tomorrow
all right title page again the big red
subwoofer story bribe bruce larkin just
looking at the art here the zub want for
appears to be not phylogenetically
related to any kind of mammal on earth
because it has six limbs two tails does
that imply two spinal cords holy fuck um
let's see is it uh try elephant-like
trunk without the large elephant ears
um uh appears to be gendered female if i
can tell from this because it has a
purple bow
and uh long eyelashes uh it's carrying a
belt strapped container two of them of
seemingly root beer uh you know if i had
to have a fucking demonic creature bring
me shit it wouldn't be root beer
probably weed
in any case
they clearly can't tell little kids that
uh your best friend will be a six-limbed
monster that brings you fucking dope so
root beard is all right and he seems
like he has a friend oh here's the
friend page one
all right let's get to reading and then
i will render my commentary
i decided to play outside
though it was a foggy day
the sun came out suddenly and burned the
fog away oh it's this whole book or
maybe fucking rhymes that's kind of
sweet
uh
uh you know
it sounds good
uh i don't know if the sun technically
burns fog away that's kind of kind of
intense you know the first uh thought i
had was the mini fog particles being
like oh fuck we're burning to death now
families of fog just getting fucking
annihilated
um by the way anytime like i have nieces
and nephews anytime i read their
children's books uh i get all these
exact same completely insane thoughts
i'm not meant to be around children any
case let's take a look at the main
character here he's
playing outside soccer by himself based
on his
posture and facial expression he
probably has no friends so his recourse
is to play outside also he's not really
looking at the ball he's not really
looking anywhere relevant uh i'm not
sure he's uh very athletic what the fuck
he's doing with his hands there um yeah
that guy's gonna be made fun of a whole
lot throughout his elementary school
career
all right and now next page a big red
subwoofer
zub wumford down the street so it has
its own verb excellent uh it was the
oddest subwoofer you could ever meet
look at there's like a a topography of
zubwomfers and this is at the extreme of
oddity
um all right it's not so odd but pretty
odd to a first grader
and i suppose our child hero saw this
subwoofer moving down the street the
thing looks to be fucking weighing like
i don't know two to three thousand
pounds i'd duck
generally but you know this kid has some
balls awesome
oh
damn this kid is fucking wise i'm not
making this up you guys see this right
here i immediately called the police to
report what i had seen
in no time at all news crews were on the
scene now on the one hand the rhyming is
sweet on the other alliteration with the
scene and scene that's cool but
seen and seen phonetically the same
no bonus points for me for rhyming now
it seems here in the art that subwoofer
is getting a lot of media attention i
actually don't see any police officers
in this no attempt to restrain zablonfer
no attempt to uh ask for documentation i
assume uh i would be particularly
interested in some sort of documentation
see what all that root beer is about you
have a license to sell that root beer
you guys probably know i'm a libertarian
i don't think you should need a license
to sell basically anything but when you
motherfucker when you have six
legs and a fucking trunk and two fucking
tails i'm gonna need to see lights of
all that shit
all that shit all right moving on
alright
there had been lots of talk of strange
creatures on our street
a subwoofer was a critter everyone
wanted to meet
all right
something that weighs maybe three tons i
wouldn't describe as occur call me crazy
critters you can usually step on this
motherfucker's gonna be doing the
stopping
there's uh folks of all ages and races
seemingly very excited to meet the sub
womfer
there's a woman on a strangely barely
elevated platform trying to take what
appears to be a picture
of said beast
maybe you know the
beast she
the zombon for it looks like she's maybe
like working to unlatch that belt and
dump a whole bunch of root beer on
everybody because this is like a party
animal like in the literal sense i think
um yeah this this guy like a couple of
people here in the middle on the left
the adults they're kind of skeptical
which is good and the bitch all the way
to the left with the oh gaping open
mouth that would be me i'd be like what
the fuck
where is my shotgun
because there's some godless shit like
that walking around i need to be
prepared
all right i have no idea how long this
book is or how long this video will be
by the way
oh shit
now we get to biology
most sub wompers have three tails
this one had only two
it was also colored red while most are
light blue
damn okay were there some heterogeneity
in the sub womford community it's good
to know um
i will point out that when your direct
relative i assume of
genetic sexual relation
has a different number of macro
structures uh like
tails good god how the fuck does that
work okay like
i guess maybe they're not all attached
to different spinal cords
the mind boggles and it looks like in
this scene
our sub one for the red one is kind of
like
yo what up big pimp and the blue one's
like sup shoddy
you know what i'm saying because she
looks female maybe they could get a pop
and we'll find out in a sec
all right
more about zaboom first zoblon first are
known to be much bigger than a horse
this one was bigger still with a longer
trunk of course
and good stuff little cowboy here on the
horse the horse recognizes unchristian
things when it sees one because the cobb
was like hey man it kind of looks fucked
up uh maybe high on like bath salts
that's a bath salt face as far as i'm
concerned and the horse is like yo what
the fuck are we doing this close to this
motherfucker he could kill both of us
he's probably drunk on his own root beer
she sorry to misgender
all right next page oh shit we got a
real evaluation it had the usual small
ears
and the standard six legs standard
dragon phylogeny
it carried its own root beer strapped on
its back in kegs
now its own root beer
is that root beer intended for sale
intended for promotional distribution or
intended for self-consumption
we don't know maybe we'll find out in a
sec got the bow
root beer this picture's interesting um
oh that that's not a bow picture that's
the small ears reference i'm a fucking
idiot in many ways i'm considerably less
intelligent than a first grader all
right next page
some folks think sub-womfers don't
really even exist
maybe fuck they get that idea from
because subwoofers are shy in hide and
the fog and mist nothing the sun
couldn't clear up from page number one
right shining that fucking sun at those
assholes you see all them shits and then
b2 carpet bombing no no you're right
b2 nuclear carpet bombing whatever fuck
that thing lives
glass
that's overkill isn't it let's be nice
to the zeb one first shall we let's find
out more about them before we decide to
be nice all right zomp oh shit zablon
first don't eat food
the stories you've heard are all true
fresh
foamy root beer is their meal and their
brew
this is an allegory for alcoholism
thinly veiled i might add
fuck and look at them eyes this bitch is
like yo i'm hitting this shit i don't
give a fuck about anyone or anything
i'll romp around the neighborhood i'll
make fun of the children
interesting question maybe we'll answer
this later in the book what happens when
the root beer runs out as i'm feeling
like this six slim two-tone monster is
going to be like all young motherfucking
children listen up
you motherfuckers better get me some
root beer otherwise timmy here is gonna
fucking die with six limbs you got four
to stand on him too to pull timmy's
fucking head from his body
i think this is going to a dark place
let's find out
subwoofers wander the land have you ever
heard their calls
not high enough
they roam the world searching
for the land of the root beer falls
okay
root beer is actually manufactured in a
a factory
but i suppose in our in our weird
universe here that shit root beer just
sits right you know so okay it says for
the land of the root beer falls the
waterfall in this picture doesn't seem
to be root beer colored so is this um
poor coloration on the part of design or
is it that they have some sort of system
by which we take this root beer ask
water process it and it actually starts
looking like root beer later for
transportation also note in the picture
if you're very clever uh one of the
subwoofers is sans uh his pack
uh his barrels so he's just walking
around fucking naked uh with a hat on
which is definitely pervert material
three fucking tails great and it seems
he's approaching ruby river we'll see
what this guy's up to
i don't trust him where are your fucking
barrels
get the fuck out of here
no fucking way
the end
what
okay
all right this is up one for sleeping
yeah
that's the end of the book it's not a
cliffhanger that's it
no wait hold up let me finish scrolling
reading level grade one through two
guided reading level
i
i need a helper read this fucking thing
intervention level 18
word count 208 that's total words that's
pretty cool
uh yeah okay well hold on
always scroll all the way through
and uh
yeah hopefully we can throw the website
in for you guys so you can check this
out
um
a lot of questions were left unanswered
and i'm curious is this just like
awful
plot building off a cliff we're done
type of writing or i suspect it's
something else
children in the first grade are unreal
curious
i've been told i'm not legally allowed
to be around children
and
maybe what they're doing here is
like
intentionally drawing this arc of
absurdity that abruptly ends with so few
questions asked but so few answered
that it gets the kids curious and then
they go read real biology and they're
like zob warfares aren't real god damn
it somebody lie to me but then they see
like eplesius or some shit and they're
like all right this will do and it's
real and it gets them going i don't
fucking know the only thing is if i was
a kid and someone read the shit to me
before i went to sleep two things one
for a while i'd be like i have so many
fun questions
answered nothing i don't want to sleep i
want to study about how to find a
fucking sub on fur what the fuck why is
the water not root beer and what
processing yields one to the other
and two
i'd be freaked out like fucking hell
because there's these things that drink
root beer what happens when they run out
what if it finds me what if it's
unpleasant that day because you know all
animals have their bad days this thing
weighs two tons it could fucking kill me
i'm scared of it i'm afraid i'm hiding
under my blanket and um
googling's up one first folks
uh i don't remember children's book
books being this fucking godless holy
crap
stay in synagogue stay in church
stay in the mosque wherever you are
buddhist temple stay in that shit stay
stick with god don't read children's
books see you next time
[Music]
[Laughter]
what the fuck dude it was like the worst
tour ever and also like there was no
interaction with the child he was just
like playing and then like no sorry
