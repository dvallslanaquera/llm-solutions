YouTube what's up Dr Mike here listen
some tough years behind us from a from a
racial Unity perspective
now don't worry now hold up don't worry
we're about to heal all that ish with
one leg workout
Mr Tristan Lee Mr Johnny Shreve they had
their beef we squashed it no worries a
little bit of beef left over but that's
getting squashed today and it's getting
squashed by a hypertrophy
RP run by the RP hypertrophy app I got
it somewhere in my pocket the app built
the workout you guys will see that in a
sec and uh there's nothing there's no
animosity and cultural misunderstanding
the high repetition vomit inducing give
up on life leg workout can't fix
and how are you supposed to be mad at
some shit when you can't even walk
I'm just kidding fellas you'll be fine
everyone's gonna walk just fine isn't
that right Johnny you've done a leg
workout with us before we're not walking
all right Christian you're feeling good
feeling good and that'll be the last
time you say that let's run it perfect
all right guys first exercise today is
going to be the lying leg curl now we
are here at pure muscle and fitness gym
in Toronto well Burlington Ontario but
close enough
and they have like a trillion lying leg
curls but there's only one the best
lying leg curl and that's any long leg
curl really if we get picky that allows
you to descend super super deep into the
stretch while loaded and this particular
Life Fitness machine
is one of the very few in which you are
allowed to go extra low now check out
this design really quick
here is the plane on which your legs
will be lying and notice
that we have a few inches of Separation
here for depth so what ends up happening
is a lot of leg curls if you leg curl on
them you come up and then it stops right
here and you come up and it stops right
here and that's really a problem because
the stretch under load is a huge
mediator of hypertrophy and it is
essentially not allowed to occur but
with this machine I can barely even tuck
into it tuck in see if I can get into it
the stretch is super deep all the way
down and all the way up this part from
here to here is critical for growth
it's going to do an unbelievable amount
of muscle damage in the best way
possible this is going to stimulate a
ton of hypertrophy
and honestly it's not even that
psychologically difficult or part of a
movement because a lot of it is
eccentric sort of passive resistance
thus and it also registers really low on
the EMG so
this is a hugely beneficial way a huge
stimulus small fatigue way to grow the
hamstrings let's get into it we're going
to be doing three or four sets of leg
curls probably for sets of don't tell
the guys 20 reps or so buy a rep match
hamstrings where you at
bye bye bye bye hamsters
two and as if you're gonna do another
slow
control deep pause unload
oh shit JK
we got that extra extra
egotistical fuck I think so anyways
unload
that's what I thought
you unload on the ramp
come here
one more coming up to the last one man
control you got it
it's all the way
still control yes
slow slow
take a pause at the bottom at the deep
deep stretch and rack
good shit oh
good shit
set one I'm like Delirious at that in my
set I love it

fight it
let's go
oh fuck
oh
oh my God
all right I went to another dimension on
the last round oh we lost you here for a
second you teleported in and out for a
little bit
that's it fellas let's walk to our next
exercise
crawl wow whatever it's in like KGB
torture shit listen you boss will tell
us all secrets yes
[Laughter]
I gotta say so Johnny's an ISD Pro I
expect this much from him
you're
control on The Eccentric and the
dedication to a full range
impressive because you're a young ass
tick-tocking motherfucker yep and I
expected you to do some Trend twins type
of shit but you're out here doing the
real real and that that's what's up it's
only because you're here I'll get the
fuck out hey as soon as I leave you're
like ah
I'll be going to do the blue machine
that's it glue one glue at a time one
glue at a time all right next up is the
leg press luckily it's just like one set
really heavy partial range of motion no
wait wait I screwed it up multiple sets
High Reps super deep I'm sorry in
advance I'm sorry in advance
[Music]
I'm so glad I took a shit for this yeah
yeah
okay so leg press time
hamstrings are cooked quad time
the thing with most leg presses is that
they're built Wrong by people who don't
know how to build machines because they
don't lift weights
the purpose of the leg press is to
stretch the quadriceps which means we
want not a ton of hit movement but a ton
of knee movement
which means we want to lean every
backpack deep as far deep down as
possible this might not be the most
comfortable thing but you guys will be
all right we insert some kind of device
to lift the hips so we get way more knee
flexion so
what we're trying to do here
sit right on top of this thing
really prop your hips right onto it
we're not going to be going super heavy
so it shouldn't feel too uncomfortable
unrack
nice and low on the machine toast
pointed slightly out and then as you go
down you let your tummy expand out and
you bring your knees out essentially to
your shoulders
big chest knees out
all the way down for a deep stretch heel
still on the machine
one second pause at the bottom full
extension to a lockout if you like if
not no big deal and then again all the
way down
every rep the same every rep slow on the
e sound trick
if you notice that during the leg press
you are experiencing a lot of pain in
the quadriceps
something that
my uh
friend colleague and training partner
Jared feather ifb Pro says
is when you feel the pain in training in
the gym
there is a natural human tendency to try
to avoid pain to recoil from it
but we have to remember that we're here
for the pain because the pain means
muscle damage it means metabolite
accumulation and those things are all at
least correlative to or causative of
hypertrophy and so when you feel that
deep burning singing insane pain in your
quads you have to reframe the pain as
this is something I want this is
something that like I'm a moth and I see
light I want more of the pain I go to
where the pain is and usually the pain
is that deeper stretches longer muscle
length slower eccentric control and
another rep and another rep and another
rep we'll be doing my reps here so as
soon as you get tired lock out and Nod
it's like as many reps as you can do
stay locked out breathe a little bit
I'll let you know when to go again we'll
do a few more reps and it will peel you
out of the machine and send you the fuck
home in a box
I was like church when you're joining
Mike's cult this is how he gets you to
get involved in his voluntary torture
devices that's right just try it out on
this pain
I do okay
wait a second don't tell the guys
four sets of leg press bio rep sets
probably two my rep brakes inside each
one so even the first set is going to be
like they're going to do like 12 rest
like four rest bike three something like
that every single set like that that
gives us yeah g whiz something like 12
approaches to failure in four sets of
leg press my God this is gonna hurt one
and then last one coming up hell yeah
make this one count Johnny
ah
fuck
oh fuck
one step into the workout
come on
dig buddy dick dig yeah
come on fight it fight it fight it
deep
fight it fight it slow slow
pause down go go
yeah I forgot how to breathe for a sec
fuck
I want somebody to see Tristan's legs
and be like how much you like pressed
man's like two plates like
properly that's right
one more one more
[Music]
I'm right here with you Johnny you
fucking push move go go
rest breathe one left take your time
with this one
come on
in a full one second pause at the bottom
up
go
ah
amazing
amazing
the set that took Johnny shoe to the
cross and Good Friday that's right
blocking my range of motion
oh never get in the way of anyone's Rob
yeah she's like oh shit I'm in another
life press again no they're everywhere
leg press you don't always have to do it
this way but this is probably one of the
more effective ways
as soon as the movement starts and you
unlock your knees
the slow eccentric means that you are
taking every part of the repetition and
making it as muscle growth promoting as
possible
and then you control it all the way down
open up your hips open up your knees
open up your chest take the maximum
range of motion keeping a tight lower
back
pause for one second at the bottom and
you will feel searing pain that
accumulates in magnitude as you pause
longer we want that sort of thing and
then on the way up feel free to be
athletic and then repeat the motion
there is a tendency psychologically for
all of us to want to get through the
Reps checklist the Reps get it done let
me ask you a question
this could go another way if you feel
free to answer in the comments when
you're having amazing sex with somebody
that you like shit somebody that you
love shit somebody you just met but
what's up girl
are you trying to get through it what
the fuck is wrong with you every single
stroke is the point you're there for
that shit if you want to nut turn on Pro
PornHub 30 seconds later your boy's out
I'm out napkin whatever I don't even
wipe anymore
that's not the way to do it you're there
for the shit it's the quality time that
you're there for every touch every
stroke every movement you're absorbing
the shit she you were here they whatever
the fuck absorbing the shit the leg
press is the same way
it's a weird way of having sex with your
muscles that hurts them a lot but the
key point is you're there for the pain
to take it all in
Let's Take It All In
[Music]
three again
oh my God amazing control big pause
go go rest breathe
three hit it
one down
slow
two down right away
slow
slower pause for a long time up go go go
damn
[Music]
God damn how many sets foreign
[Music]
fuck
all right come on
rest back one more you're done one more
and you're done but a good one take your
time with this one the last wrap come on
Johnny push hit it
[Music]
speed
ah
stop
you know it's a death step when he
misses the rerack oops
all's well that ends well
I was trying to talk shit like the words
okay watch this hey hey do something
pussy you little bitch to get up get up
trying to fight you
that's what hard set to look like guys
hey all right let's go
here's what we're gonna do gentlemen
every now and again
we do something a little bit different
it turns out that isometric contractions
are not overly productive for
hypertrophy in most cases which means if
we don't move the muscle we just stress
it while it's standing still there's
some hypertrophes
but
isometric contractions at very long
muscle lengths
they do actually provide a robust muscle
growth stimulus
so what we're going to do today is so
easy it's almost difficult for me to
explain it because it's going to sound
like not a challenge here it is fellas
we're gonna line you two up at the same
time you're going to go down not to
where your calves touch your hamstrings
but one inch above that
you are going to maintain that position
until I say up and it's usually going to
be a four or five second count you come
up and then it's going to be a slow
descent and when both people have
descended I begin to count one two three
four up just like that and we'll see who
collapses first the U2 close to each
other is a more of a camaraderie YouTube
bullshit influence of thing this is not
a competition because all of the reps
are for you the other person falls it
doesn't matter you're still in a fight
you didn't beat anyone no one got
defeated it's versus for Fun on YouTube
good thumbnail but this is this is all
internal connect with your muscles and
make sure that burn is there sound good
one
two three four
fuck one
two three
four up down slow
stop right there one
two
three
four
up down slow
stop one two
[Music]
three
four up down
slow
one let's go two buddy three four up and
down
slow control stop right there do not
move one two do not sink down three
stop
stop one two
three
four four four
[Music]
I got nothing else fellas I'm all out of
Tricks let me type that into the RP
patented hypertrophy app
you can do it Johnny everyone believes
in you there we go
done
success done Johnny and Tristan
annihilated this workout the take homes
for me are this
the technique was right from Get Go the
effort was right and there was more reps
to be done they did it and they never
slacked they never cheated zero excuses
sure you have to wipe yourself up off
the ground after each set and listen
after you do the next set is up you guys
did phenomenal work you couldn't be
happier thanks RP hypertrophy app for
programming something stupid and insane
you want to buy the app that's on sale
sooner already depending on when this
video comes out
I guess have fun or whatever yeah
gentlemen what do you think how'd this
feel
death
all right
awesome see you guys next time
