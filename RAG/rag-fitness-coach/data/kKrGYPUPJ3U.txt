some people argue like I'd rather have
constant muscle tension than they go
full range I would ask them what the
point of constant muscle tension is why
is that better I think that if your
range of motion that you've chosen is
the one that gives you the best pump by
it all like an obvious long shot I would
be remiss to tell you it's not going to
work I'd say I think that's really great
what I would do though is I would come
to the gym with you and try to get you
to do super range of motion hack squats
Etc and see if you didn't get an even
better pump
