when training to put on muscle mass
there are a few principles that help you
understand why training a certain way
produces the results it does
in this video which is the first of a
three part video series we'll go through
one underrated and less known principle
neuromechanical matching which has
implications for wart exercises you may
want to select in a regimen designed for
developing muscle mass
to grasp neuromechanical matching it is
first worth understanding its cousin
henneman size principle
there's a good chance you're aware of
henneman size principle at least in its
simplest form
namely as you use progressively heavier
and heavier weights or as you fatigue
while performing repetitions with a
light weight
more and more muscle fibers get
recruited
it's worth diving into this principle
more as not only is it highly
fascinating but it somewhat relates to
neuro-mechanical matching
henneman's size principle says
multi-units are recruited in sequential
order
a motor unit refers to a single motor
neuron that branches out and supplies
electrical signals to a bundle of
multiple muscle fibers
when the single motor neuron sends
electrical signals to the multiple
muscle fibers it supplies
the fibers produce force
different types of motor units exist and
their characteristics can be described
across a spectrum
on one end of the spectrum are slow
motor units also called low threshold
motor units that consist of a small
motor neuron that supplies a bundle of
slow twitch muscle fibers
slow twitch muscle fibers produce low
forces but are very fatigue resistant
on the other end of the spectrum are
fast motor units also called high
threshold motor units that consist of a
large motor neuron that supplies a
bundle of fast twitch muscle fibers
fast twitch muscle fibers produce high
forces but fatigue quickly
when producing low muscle forces only
slow motor units are primarily recruited
for example when walking at a slow pace
the slow motor units within your various
lower body muscles are primarily
recruited
but as a muscle progressively needs to
generate higher and higher forces or it
fatigues while trying to sustain a given
force output
those higher threshold motor units get
recruited
this is henneman's size principle the
concept that motor units are recruited
in a sequential order depending on the
demands imposed on a muscle
it's called henneman size principle as
it was eelwood henneman who first
discovered all this during his
pioneering research in the 1960s
this principle is one reason behind
something we consistently see in the
literature
that a wide range of loads as light as
thirty percent one rate max and as heavy
as eighty percent one at max produce
similar muscle growth provided reps are
performed to or close to failure
heavier loads like an eighty percent one
rate max load will readily recruit many
motor units from the slow to fast motor
units as the muscle readily needs to
generate high forces
moreover as you nail failure with this
load further fast motor units are
recruited
light loads like a thirty percent water
at max load predominantly only require
slow motor unit recruitment initially as
the muscle only needs to produce low
forces but as you continue performing
repetitions and get closer and closer to
failure
those fast motor units get recruited
ultimately overall multi-unit
recruitment ends up being similar to
what's achieved with heavier loads thus
meaning you stimulate a similar number
of muscle fibers partly explaining the
similar muscle growth observed between
light and heavy loads
now we understand henneman size
principle how does neuromechanical
matching fit into the picture
[Music]
imagine you've performed the back squat
with repetitions to failure with a
thirty percent one rep max load
based on henneman size principle alone
you would think you've more or less
stimulated all the slow and fast motor
units throughout the whole of the
quadriceps however this is probably not
true
there's evidence within muscles
subgroups of motor units exist
these subgroups of motor units do not
have identical functions
for instance with the biceps though it's
not crystal clear currently
some evidence suggests three
sub-population of motor units could
exist
the first motor unit subgroup is only
recruited during flexion of their elbow
and nothing else
the second motor unit subgroup is only
recruited during supination of the
forearm and nothing else
the third motor unit subgroup is only
recruited during both elbow flexion and
supination of the forearm
within each of these subgroups of most
units heleman's size principle likely
applies
for instance
if you perform some sort of forearm
supination exercise 2 failure the
subgroup of motor units within the
biceps that carry out supination only
will be recruited in sequential order
that is if you are using a light load
the slow motor units of that sub group
will be recruited first and then as you
know failure the fast motor units part
of that subgroup will be further
recruited
direct and indirect evidence for the
existence of subgroups of motor units
exist for other muscles like the triceps
calves quadriceps hamstrings and other
smaller muscles belonging to the hand
and forearm
what is the purpose of these multi-unit
subgroups
neuromechanical matching may be the
answer
numerous muscle fibers exist within a
muscle as a fun fact some researchers
have estimated the biceps brachii of
humans contains anywhere from 198 000 to
419 000 muscle fibers
during any given movement that recruits
a muscle all the muscle fibers within
that muscle don't have identical
mechanical advantage
numerous intricate factors go behind
determining the mechanical advantage of
muscle fibers during a movement but you
can simply think of mechanical advantage
as how easily a muscle fiber can produce
force for a given movement
as an example during elbow flexion
some muscle fibers in the biceps are
going to be positioned to more
efficiently produce elbow flexion forces
while other muscle fibers in the biceps
are positioned in a way that means
they're less efficient at producing
elbow flexion forces
this probably explains why subgroups of
motor units exist within a muscle
the different subgroups contain muscle
fibers that have different mechanical
advantages for different movements
returning to the three potential moto
unit subgroups in the biceps
the subgroup of motor units involved in
elbow flexion only would presumably
contain muscle fibers that are
positioned to be mechanically
advantageous for elbow flexion only
the subgroup of motor units involved in
supination only would presumably contain
muscle fibers that are positioned to be
mechanically advantageous for supination
only
the subgroup of motor units involved in
simultaneous supination and elbow
flexion would presumably contain muscle
fibers that position to be mechanically
advantageous for both these motions
this is neuromechanical matching where
the nervous system matches the
recruitment of mechanically advantageous
muscle fibers to a specific movement
[Music]
in the literature there's now good
evidence for regional hypertrophy
this is where a muscle does not grow
evenly across its regions
for example kawakami and colleagues
found after subjects trained overhead
extensions for 16 weeks the triceps
mainly increased in cross-sectional area
in the middle to slightly upper regions
but in the most upper and lower regions
of the muscle
little growth was experienced
likewise emma and colleagues found after
leg extension training for 12 weeks
growth not only differed between the
quadriceps heads but within each of
these muscle heads growth differed
between the upper and lower regions of
them
neuro-mechanical matching is a strong
candidate to explain regional
hypertrophy
the regions of a muscle that grow the
most in response to a single exercise
probably contain muscle fibers that are
positioned to be more mechanically
advantageous during the execution of
that exercise
the implication of neuromechanical
matching is one exercise for a muscle or
muscle group is likely not going to
maximize its overall growth
you're probably going to want to select
a couple of different exercises per
muscle that biomechanically differ
this should increase the probability you
effectively simulate more if not all the
multi-unit subgroups within a muscle
thus leading to greater growth across
more regions of a muscle
as some examples
training the biceps and triceps at a
variety of shoulder angles is probably a
good idea
training the hamstrings with not only
hip extension motions but also a knee
flexion motion is likely a good idea
for the back having vertical and
horizontal pulling variations is likely
a good idea
for the quadriceps including a couple of
different knee extension exercises is
likely a good idea
