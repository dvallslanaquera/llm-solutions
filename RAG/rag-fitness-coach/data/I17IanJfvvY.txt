all right folks
welcome friday morning of our mass phase
training sample week
stuff's getting pretty hairy i'm pretty
tired jared's pretty tired
charlie won't be in this video he is
going to be joining some other folks in
a later video
he is still training legs today but he's
going to be training with them we got a
bunch of
really cool leg training competition
stuff that he's in because he's insane
his quads are insane
he kind of sets the standard and we'll
see who can keep up jared and i can't so
he's in another video
video with stronger people here's the
deal
i'm not going to tell you what we're
going to do exactly up front just
exercise by exercise why
because we're traveling right now we're
at a foreign gym
power strength gym in orlando florida
and
we don't exactly know what we're gonna
do we have a template
we have to train hamstrings it should be
a lying leg curl we'll see if the
machine is decent enough
we're going to be training some kind of
compound quad push leg press and or hack
squat we're going to try the machines
figure out which one works and then
we'll tell you when we're doing them
why don't we have this crazy plan in
advance because we've never been here
before and a lot of you folks that
travel
you'll have to put together a plan on
the fly we're going to be doing a high
relative effort
multiple sets getting a good workout but
the machines will pick on the fly
we're going to try them see if the
stimulus fatigue ratio is good if it's
not we'll try another machine
stick with us let's get started with my
[Music]
curls
jared is doing straight sets probably
four sets of 10 to 20 reps each on the
hamstring curl
what i'm gonna do is mini drop set so
i'm still gonna do four sets just like
jared
except i'm gonna do a main set of 10 to
20 reps at the chosen weight
get close to failure and as soon as that
happens i'm gonna lean over a little bit
see if i can do this
and take the stack and go to roughly
two-thirds the weight i was using
two-thirds to three-quarters little mini
drop set just one
do as many reps as i can and then that's
one set a cool little metabolite
technique it works pretty well
especially when traveling
and you're not really set on which
weights you're gonna have to use for me
i need a little bit more hamstring
volume but this way it's four cents to
four cents for jared
and uh we both get a really good
hack squats uh jared and i are a lot
heavier than we're used to
post contest bloat continues
so lower back is really fried that tends
to happen
a lot of fluid accumulates by the lower
back and it messes with uh
with your electrolyte dynamics so you
get really crazy pumps and burns and
lower back doing nothing
so after hamstring curls our lower backs
are pumped we're gonna see how hot spots
go
this is time to kind of nut up you know
it's not an injury risk it's just pain
let's do some hack squats
[Music]
um
[Music]
uh
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
wow
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
all right
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
good rar mike
i mean let me show you how to train hard
i don't know if anybody else would like
this but this shit
doesn't fly for me
[Music]
yeah i don't like that shit it doesn't
mean shit but i'm just
visually appealing right
like visually appealing and then jared
is making the cases more visually
appealing
yeah that he's more visually impaired i
think the classic physique
national judges would have to agree
that's why he had a pro card i don't
have shit
masters overall win a local show
i was talking about my attire look at
this oh you're a fucking friend
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
aah
[Music]
wow
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
so
that's it for jared and i for legs
multiple sets of
lying leg curls followed by multiple
sets of hack squats four from e3 for
jared
different maximum recoverable volumes
minimum effective volumes
i'm uh i need a little bit more volume
afterwards
so after my fourth set of hacks i did
lunges right after
pre-exhaust the quads it means they're
close to failure all the time
26 total reps blew away like 240 right
now so it's you know something
definitely feel it in the quads then i
uh fell down
started vomiting in my throat got up hit
my head
on a fucking rack went to go throw up
dry heaves
now i'm back in the ground folks that's
all we got for you
start training easy get the easy games
they go harder and harder and harder as
needed jared and i are pretty big pretty
advanced
this is needed catch you later
you
