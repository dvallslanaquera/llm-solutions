it is good to be back it's doctor james
dr mike the bullier of children
as we know him now just kidding
oh you're gonna know i've been known to
push around a few eight-year-olds on the
playground
hey hey hey kid get out of here
weekly webinars back our bi-weekly
webinar i should say
dun dun dun here to answer your
questions
dr mike how are we doing good is the
bi-weekly webinar kind of like used to
be the weekly webinar and then it's like
you know i think girls but guys are
looking
cute buy a curious webinar
all the honestly off the cuff but
it's not not it's not politically
incorrect it just looks straight up
bisexual people won the fucking lottery
they have all the fun it's total
bullshit the rest of us are
stuck with half the fucking options
they're stuck with fucking double bro
double how the i know
well we should probably get to questions
before we shoot ourselves in the foot
with stupidness which is what we always
do we'll do that at some point in the
middle yeah
all right this is a hell of a name james
here we go
straight from the countries of europe
comes jules
grahamers oh i got that one yep
jewels it also makes me think of the
isn't there like a cigarette
uh replacement thing called the jewel is
it really
i think it's like a uh yeah like a
vaporizer
cigarette wiener offer thing the jewels
of course
it's all jokes here so please take no
offense this name jules grammers
is like what he would be introducing
with a movie about like spycraft in the
ca
i was gonna say it's like evil german
for super terrorists
like he is a techno terrorist for hire
for any country and he's originally from
sweden but grew up in
denmark and his jewish dramas and he is
impossible to cash
easily like an avengers style villain
100
all right he asks if you do a sport with
unpredictable forces on the shoulder
wrestling climbing rugby etc
i would say climbing is pretty
predictable forces but nonetheless
um how would you approach training the
shoulders to prepare them for violent
eventualities what a well-worded
question james
all you my friend yeah so this uh i like
i like what the way you're thinking but
this actually is a very simple answer so
you train the shoulder in the way that
is within the realm of specificity for
whatever activity that you're doing
right
so that would mean making your shoulders
uh in whatever part of a shoulder girdle
or
you know clavicular end or whatever side
that you're working on
it's strong and has the work capacity
within the ranges of motion that you
should expect within the sport now some
of those are going to be bigger or
smaller so
again constrained by specificity and
then for the um
kind of the impact or contact portion
that's simply a matter of conditioning
as a result of practicing the actual
sport and activity
so kind of it's like a two-part answer
and one is like train the muscles within
the realm of specificity for
the activity that's kind of a no-brainer
and then condition
the muscles and joints and structures to
the impacts and
uh forces of the activity itself so
here's a really bad example
rugby since you threw rugby in there
i'll do that one
a lot of people are afraid of getting
contact injuries in rugby
so they avoid contact during practice
well guess what happens when they start
doing their first live couple matches
they're not conditioned to the impacts
of making tackles breaking tackles
and as a result they get injured so part
of your periodization scheme
for whatever it is wrestling rugby you
know contact sports
is what i would just call um
conditioning the body to
those forces and impacts and falls and
and you know
all around to some of those situations
so that um you have a built up tolerance
to that
over time and you can you can you can
take it a classic example in like
kickboxing is uh
somebody who checks a kick whose shins
are not conditioned for that right
break a tibia um stuff like that how do
you prevent that from happening well you
condition your shins you know and that
just comes through
incrementally more and more intense uh
practice of things like
initially kicking bags and then kicking
things like partners with shin pads on
and then eventually moving into
live sparring at some point so there's
like a progressive component there of
conditioning the body to those types of
forces
there you go nothing prepares you for
the forces like an
incremental exposure to the forces which
blows but
yeah all right excellent answer next up
uh is gustavo la gomes
oh another spicy one who just you just
put out his cuban cigar and his butler's
face i'm done with this
i need new butlers he says dr mike
do you still train in blowjob job if yes
do you find hard to manage hypertrophy
adding bjj as you get more and more
advanced so it's actually easier as i
get more and more advanced in bjj
because i use less energy and physical
effort and more technique and
positioning and patience and timing
so my physical exertion in jiu jitsu
actually tends to fall over time which
is so sweet so i remember the times in
jiu-jitsu it was just this totally
draining thing
and now i can choose it to be totally
draining or i can choose it to not be
totally draining and i still get great
training
um but on the hypertrophy side yeah as i
get more advanced it's tougher
and thus for the next several years as
i'm trying to peak in my bodybuilding
sort of lifetime achievement i'm
actually choosing to do
um less jiu jitsu than normal two to
three sessions a week
uh maybe two to four instead of sort of
three to five
and i do less hard rolling uh in more
technical positional work so that i
could de-stress
uh that does that make me get not as
good as jiu-jitsu as i could be yes and
it's a trade-off but it allows my mrv
to open up more to um to my lifting
so that's the thing yeah and i mean you
can imagine like
the the impact of even just changing
what you do in practice from
let's say taking a couple even just
maybe 20 minutes of live rolling at the
end of
a practice session you just eliminate
that and you just do drilling and your
systemic fatigue like
it goes through the roof right like
that's a huge difference when you're
making like a competitive
i don't want to say maximal effort but
it's like competitive efforts which are
not always
maximum like in that sense especially if
you're like like dr mike was saying he's
more trained so he's probably less
spazzy and less prone to making like
inefficient maximal efforts on stuff
that he doesn't need to you know so
that's a situation where you can see
like if your systemic fatigue is
limiting like you drop out the
live competition stuff yeah
or just choose not to go as hard you
know there's a bunch of stuff i do in
competition where i know
i could win a position win points or win
the match if i make this move but i
choose not to make it because it's
really systemically like
so for example if i'm crawling up
someone's lapel and they're resisting a
lot sometimes i'll switch positions to
crawl up another way to pass guard
versus grind crawling if it was a
competition i would just grind right
through them
but fuck that i'm doing an extra poll
workout doing that so
i sometimes make accommodations like
that but it's really once you get the
ego out of the way it's really easy to
make the accommodation
it's tough though because you're in a
physical fight and you want to win we
all do
great answer next up p nagi
what the fuck bye
bye balant
valent yeah that sounds bright penang
balan
panetti bay let's get mr bailin out here
hey man penang is that one of them
italian sandwiches
doggy all right p naggy
asks the following he says i had a
really weird dream about dr mike
but i thought we're sharing 50s kids
says gee whiz all sorts of funny stories
start like that
i don't know where this is going we'll
see oh boy i was trying to wash my teeth
and wash your teeth that's first problem
i'm just kidding
so uh while mike was trying to figure
out what is the ideal rep count in rer
for my brushing
i was about eight reps on one side and
my god
he started to shout like a maniac then i
need to stop right now because i will
overreach my enamel
thanks the advice in the end my teeth
were brighter than ever
i might have to watch i might have
watched too much rp in the last few
weeks
it sounds like you sure as hell did but
don't stop now
ideally we want the entire world to tune
into the rp youtube
give us millions of dollars and just die
right in front of their tvs
you know that the whole like brain dead
thing where like snot comes out of your
nose and out of your mouth yes
so keep it up speaking of weird dreams
i've been taking um
like this like male fertility supplement
just to like get my sperm and
supercharge mode
james that's like putting extra armor on
the world's greatest main battle tank
i know right uh it's it's weird but i've
been running into a problem
where um it has a lot of zinc in it and
i've been like exceeding my cma limit
and so for like the last week i've been
waking up and having like
paranoid like like i uh where i met my
dreams
well that and like i there was a couple
weird ones where i woke up and i was
like
man i really blew that that disney deal
for rp and man i should have like
i don't know what i was thinking and
then i was like look at i'm thinking to
myself like
disney deal like what and what did that
what and i had a couple other ones where
i had like um
i think i had like wronged a mafioso and
i was like i gotta get you know what
mel and the dog's out of here we we're
we're in trouble and i was like
wait what and that's like this is like a
real thought i'm having as i'm waking up
like man i fucked up i need to fix this
um you know amazing yeah and then you
like slowly
comes to you as you're waking up like oh
whoa that was that was a dream oh my god
you know that's a pretty good movie
of you wrong a mafioso and they show up
to your house and mel just one by one
toasts them all out in the wilderness
yeah yeah well uh i was thinking of it
it was kind of like um
uh was that movie i think was with tom
hanks road to perdition
right is that the run where he's like on
the run and with this kid or whatever
i've never seen that movie okay that's
basically like the dream i was having
um but yeah but luckily we have mel here
and lots of guns and no mafia no mafia
but yes i've been on the weird dream
wagon 2 p naggy uh i've been exceeding
my zinc
my zinc mrv for dreams is your uh
ejaculate volume bigger than normal yeah
[Laughter]
they got all that that what's it called
maca just what's up
supercharges your your shit down there
how does it compare to truck stop
ejaculoids well that's like the best i
don't know what they put in there
it's like that's like space jizz
accelerator i don't know it's like the
opposite of a black hole for jizz this
is like
white hole oh i didn't even
any astute observers the the the adult
video series
white holes black poles excellent
all right next up is some on like dude
meelo is gonna fucking write the uh the
show notes for this and be like
like what are this what of this am i
what do you even call this
some online project says hey docs how
does someone natural factor in blood and
plasma donations or
training considerations want to donate
but admittedly held up by not knowing
how to minimize gym interference so
first of all get your blood work done
and see where you are hematocrit
hemoglobin you need to be like
at the top half of the values otherwise
if you dip like way below that it's
going to suck for like actually a few
weeks because red blood cells take a
while to reconstruct plasma not as much
takes a few days
but red blood cells is weak so make sure
at the top end or at least top half of
the range
then uh donate right at the beginning of
a deload week or an act of rest
and then by the time you're back to
training you'll feel mostly really good
and expect to be
maybe a little sluggish and then after a
few weeks it'll be totally great so it's
probably our best advice james
yeah that's really that's the only thing
i would say i would say definitely don't
do it when you have like your peak week
coming up that would be like probably
the worst case scenario in terms of
training god um but other other than
that yeah i would just plan it around
like your lower activity times like your
d
loads your active rest maybe like week
one kind of thing um
probably not a huge deal but any time
after that it's probably not good
next up week 1987.
man that was almost certainly born in
the year 19. he has like a funny uh
avatar too oh yeah
[Music]
so he goes hi guys love the content
my girlfriend refuses to believe that
special sports supplements don't shrink
men's sausage despite me convincing her
otherwise
i am not using it never will could you
explain to her that they don't and
perhaps address the answers
to camila ooh camila you got
named hashtag names oh she's been doxxed
camila a swat team is delivering a pizza
to your house as we speak isn't that
what boxing is
so here's the deal um
in some individuals the use of anabolic
androgenic agents will absolutely
decrease the size of the testicles
and not the penis there is no mechanism
by which they decrease penis size
and furthermore it's not even all people
so a lot of people are testicular sizes
and change
uh so uh camilla if you're thinking of
stepping out on week 1987
with uh and having a ball with a steroid
user
just don't expect his nuts to crush your
head
uh his penis size should be independent
of his use
i love that like the the assumption is
that like every
steroids just make the whole the whole
package shrink the whole thing
is small i think the number one reason
why that
is a myth is of course the lack of
specificity some some people knew
there's some truth to that but not
which one the number two reason and a
huge reason of why
people don't look in i think people are
sort of
using steroids means you're a big mean
bully and and you're kind of alpha alpha
and people want to bring those people
down
and there's no better justice in this
universe to be like yeah but now your
dick is small
you know like it's just something like
it's something people want to comfort
themselves with
uh so they can like still go to parties
and feel manly around like jacked up
dudes and together to stick smaller yeah
it's not
like god damn it or even if it is
unrelated it was already small right
yeah
be like was that the steroids like new
god no
when i walked into the you know seventh
grade locker room nobody batted an
eye all right next up is six
five one two chris we are like totally
synchronized on this
one for whatever reason like yeah it's
good i'm just like
what changed why are we why were we not
synchronized before
yeah right go youtube go yeah
chris says hey docs what do you think
about the idea of biasing more of your
sets in the five to six
rep range as this builds strength and
has equivalent hypertrophy a sense of
five to thirty
would greater gains of strength
potentiate better i purchased in the
long run
so the answer the second question is
probably not there's no mechanism by
which that seems likely uh
what about the first one james what do
you think the upsides and downsides are
of
uh sticking in the five to six range
aimless plug
shameless hypertrophy book beats this to
death
beats it to death check that out but
kind of the quick and quick and dirty
version is right so
it is true that in a if we're just
looking at like you know growth per rep
it does seem like the the
heavier end of the 5 to 30 range maybe
has some benefit in terms of how much
stimulus you get
per repetition the trade-off there
though is that it also generates a lot
more fatigue
per repetition than doing something
that's much lighter and
one of the problems that you run into is
a much excuse me as a
wear and tear type issues from using
such heavy weights
so although you might uh be getting
great growth out of doing squats you
know for five sets of five to six
at some point you might start breaking
down and it might be your knees it might
be your lower back it could be your
shoulders from just having to hold that
heavy weight up what you just find is
that
having to use that much weight and i
just use the squat as an example pick
your poison could be bench press or
anything else
um what you tend to find is that the
wear and tear from doing that much heavy
work all the time
tends to limit your ability to have long
productive injury-free training
so another problem that you run into
with the heavier stuff is for a lot of
people they don't have a good mind
muscle connection at that range or when
you have to use exercises which don't
are not conducive to really good mind
muscle connections so one one or the
other
um and that might be a long-term
trade-off you're making in terms of
muscle growth as well so although it's
not a bad idea
if you are more fast twitch biased to
maybe
entertain that rep range a bit more it's
not a good idea to just arbitrarily pick
that range uh pick that lower end of the
range and say well i'm going to get
stronger and more muscular
so it's probably better in some sense in
the short term
maybe in the long term you're probably
making a very big trade-off in longevity
and having to take more fatigue
management strategies than if you just
entertain some more moderate rep ranges
totally and james like you said you know
these are averages
that people on average gain the same
muscle for sets of five to six some
people respond way better to higher reps
than lower abs then just for sure you
could be one of those
or more likely one of your muscle groups
could be one of those you're like man
my quads are doing great that's a five
to six so are my hamstrings but my
fucking calves just anything under
12 reps and they just don't nothing
happens and it's kind of like well
it's like any dogmatic element it starts
to have some trade-offs and downsides
yeah i mean like trying to do bicep
curls for sets of five to six or like uh
deltoids you know it's like
lateral yeah
yeah all right jack
n there's two questions
first the one with nine upvotes how can
we assess our volume landmarks for
exercises that train similar muscles and
performance elements
if i detect a dip in my clean
performance how do i know if it's
attributed on my cleans
snatches squats or pulls seeing as they
all affect similar systems
and what are the implications of that in
making programs
so you actually can you can't tell on
any one element
what you do is you increase and decrease
the volumes of all of those different
elements over time
you add one in take another away and you
watch for long-term trends and after
months and months and years and years
you can start to say things like
anytime i do a lot of low bar squatting
my fatigue starts to go up faster
and when i do front squatting it's
actually much less fast
you start to be able to make
relativistic statement like that mrvs
are never in lifts mrvs are in muscle
groups
um so i mean it can be in lift but this
just doesn't tell you a whole lot
because really the underlying muscle
group is what's what's fatigued
um so the implications of of this and
making programs is that
you can get clarity on muscle groups but
you can't get clarity on lifts
for lifts as to stimulus to fatigue
ratio and thus how they affect your mrv
you can rate their sfrs individually
that's very easy
and then you can suspect that the ones
with the really not so great sfrs
probably affect your volume landmarks
the most
so for example if you know that uh let's
say bent rose and dumbbell rows
that rose just be the fuck up dumbbell
rows just don't
you know you could say okay my
background rv is this and someone's like
well i guess
which part of just dumbbell rows or
barbell rows contribute more to your
maximum recovery volume
probably barbell roasters are way more
fatiguing that starts to become
something you can do in the short term
in the longer term of course you just
have to watch for these patterns and
trends
and after years and years someone's like
hey you want to do incline barbell press
you're like nah that doesn't have a
great sfr for me and it really just
every time i do it it beats my shoulders
up and real lowers my mrv and like well
how do you know it's your mrv is lowered
by that well because
when i do flies or flat bench or those
other things my mrv is pretty high but
anytime i started inclining
including inclines it seems that that's
the sort of
the one variable that reliably brings it
down
yeah really good and in the example of
weightlifting you could kind of look at
some of the other things that you're
doing and you can kind of break down
like where
you are starting to break down on your
lifts and look at so for example
if you notice that um you're having
troubles with lockouts and catches
and it seems that your like upper body
is really what's holding you back like
you got lots of pep lots of jump lots of
explosiveness
and every time you try to catch in the
snatch position or you know lock out
your
jerks uh you might find that like your
upper body is actually the limiting
factor on that and you might have to go
back and look and see like okay how much
of this other upper body stuff was i
doing
and figure out okay at what point uh
even though those might not be reaching
their limits in terms of what they can
handle they're starting to influence my
other lifts like my snatch my cleaning
jerk
and then you could also look at things
like all right on some days like i just
can't even fucking lift this weight off
i'm just clarking it every time which is
like when you don't even do the pulley
just kind of dead lift it up
um you might find that okay well
actually now my like posterior chain
muscles are just two tacks like i can't
even just hold this bar up in position
right because my lower back and my
glutes are just
fried and you might find like some days
you can catch it you can
you can get it up but you just got no
speed no power it's just slow as fuck
and you just don't feel crisp and that
just might mean like
you're literally in a too low of a state
of overall preparedness to be explosive
right so you just you're not showing up
with the preparedness needed to actually
execute the overload stimulus for those
movements and that's
as a result of probably either systemic
fatigue local fatigue or some
combination of both so you can kind of
you can kind of put them together but as
mike said that's something that takes
weeks and years of just monitoring and
saying like okay how much work off the
floor am i doing how much upper body
stuff am i doing i got to dial it back
here dial this one up here and it just
it's a long guess and check process
yeah next up
tomare got it
[Music]
he says hey ducks when i do more than
two sets
to my calves in a row i almost never
feel my calf mind muscle connection
although at the end of the set i feel a
burn i can't even feel it contracting
i think you said in one of your lectures
is because too much metabolite prevents
the nerve
from communicating to the muscle i do 15
to 25 reps is that a problem
because i guess the rsm is falling
quickly it will it be better for me
to do more frequency and fewer sets i do
four sets per session
maybe just half sets in the 15 uh 5 to
15 zone and the other
15 to 25 you can try all those things i
would try another one try to rest longer
between that's what i was going to say
ah james um do you want to explain why
that's a good idea and we'll wrap that
question up um yeah so one of the
problems that you just might be running
into is like really really rapid onset
metabolite accumulation which is just
preventing you from
uh getting a good mind muscle connection
outside of the initial burn of the first
like one or two sets
and it might just be like down
regulating how much force you can
actually use so it's one of those things
with the caps like it might just take
another
25 30 seconds and it might be more than
enough to get you back to having like a
really productive set where you can feel
a lot of tension and force in the muscle
and actually focus on that kind of
intrinsic what's it called um
kinesthetic type feel for it i think
more often than not in these situations
where you basically go flat
instantly in an exercise it's just
because you are not allowing enough
recovery time
probably not allowing metabolites to
clear out and you're just getting down
regulated muscle contractions at that
point
yeah um
yeah let us know if it works
adam bean bean brother of
long lost brother of mr bean
he says is it possible to hit an mrv by
doing by going only
one to three reps in reserve when i
generated hamstring curls even if i
leave a few reps in the tank my
hamstrings are incredibly sore and take
all week to recover
yes it absolutely is so your mrv is
going to be
lower and lower uh the closer and closer
to failure your volume is
so if everything's to failure it's going
to be some number if everything's 1rir
it's going to be a little higher 2r a
little higher
but for some muscles that are taking an
incredible amount of eccentric damage
like the hamstrings in exercises like
the nordic curl
um then even if you stay very shy of
failure
your maximum recovery volume can be very
low or just you could just take a lot of
huge hit
so that's totally fine and remember
that's like the biggest insight for the
volume landmarks
is they are whatever they are for you
because there's a very easy logical
mathematical way to figure them out
especially mrv then you just know what
they are for you and you go from there
um we've had a lot of very similar
questions over the probably over the
years really about like hey especially
about hamstrings like hey guys my mrv on
hamstrings is real low is there
something wrong with me no
james and i have very low rvs on
hamstrings too and most people don't as
a matter of fact
with the james hoffman squint method of
people claiming their mrvs are very high
that method works the best on hamstrings
because james and i have been getting in
touch with many people who are like yeah
i can do
25 sets of hamstrings a week bullshit
fucking bullshit let me see how you do
it's like partial range everything
barely any rar you're like watch this do
three strict sets of stiff legged
deadlifts properly anteriorly
tilted pelvis knees forward and all of a
sudden that person can't fucking walk to
their car
and they're sore for a week and a half
and it's like so what where are you
doing and they're like
uh yeah fuckery that's what they were
doing hamstrings
take a big beating and like in this case
adam um
you probably that i find the nordic curl
to be kind of a silly exercise not
because it's
bad i just it's one of those funny ones
where it doesn't really feel like you're
doing much but in this case
clearly it's probably a really high sfr
movement for you in terms of like what
you put in and what you get out
so if you're getting like crippled
crippling soreness from it it might mean
you only need to do like two sets in
you're you're good right and you don't
need to be
sore like for the entire week you might
just be overdoing it because you're like
oh this is like a relatively easy
movement it's comparatively to like a
good morning or a stiff legged deadlift
so my guess is you might be doing like
four or five sets and then you're fucked
up for the whole week maybe just try two
or three and see how that goes because
it's probably a good sfr movement for
you
yeah all right
yoshi
got it yoshi
he says why do you typically feel more
sore the day
uh following days after training session
rather than immediately after
this is a phenomenon that you can google
called d-o-m-s delayed onset muscle
soreness
and the reason it occurs is the damage
itself doesn't make you very sore
but the damage is significant enough to
where the immune system
with all of its many different types of
often very large cells
need to infiltrate the muscle actually
unzip the muscle fiber itself and start
helping to fix and heal the damage and
potentiate adaptation and these immune
components
when they unzip the muscle cells all
kinds of nasty shit comes floating out
and hits the nerves
and the local swelling itself hits the
nerves and a bunch of other
metabolites of the immune system cells
themselves the immune system cells
themselves pressing up against nerve
cells
and all of a sudden that creates a very
high inflammatory
very uh nerve sensitive painful
environment
yeah yeah and that's like like mike said
that's a really something easy you can
look up and there's a variety of
different inflammatory mechanisms that
contribute so it's
hard to pin down to one exact thing but
yeah easy to easy to find
yeah all right last question
for the day is from our very
uh regular high vote high up voted
it was just funny like it's super high
uploaded but it's way down here henrik
anderson
yeah he consistently delivers but like
why
why the fuck is it all the way down here
maybe no one commented on it i don't
know
that's what i was thinking and then um
you look at yushi and he only has
10 and no comments so it's like it
doesn't even make it's like not even
internally consistent what's the deal
what's the deal what the fuck
henrikh anderson says how do you go
about counting sets
when the raw stimulus magnitude is very
high a good example those would be leg
extensions with six sets average quad
mv of weekly leg extensions can't do any
squat variations due to injury be enough
to maintain size
so remember the six average sense of
quad maintenance so first of all it's
average for
everyone this entire you know human
population all together relatively
weight training people
so it could be different for you and
it's for the average exercise
if you do like high bar ass to grass
squats and you're super well leveraged
to get a huge beating out of them
maybe able to do two or three sets of
squats per week
and have no problem maintaining your
quad size matter of fact that's
definitely true
if you do one set monday wednesday
friday one hard set of squatting there's
no way you're losing quad size it's not
going to happen
but uh what about leg extensions well
you have to find
a level of leg extending that can
maintain your quad size
by experimentation and you already know
it's probably going to be more like
extensions in your case because you seem
to not get a lot of rustiness magnitude
out of them
i don't either james gets a huge rust in
those magnetic channel extensions
so it's different for him still so how
do you go about counting sets when they
are something very high
exactly the same as usual but you just
got to realize that the number of sets
you end up with as your maintenance
volume
will be different also i would suggest i
think james and i
both suggest staying away from such
isolations as the core of your
maintenance because uh there's a lot of
other muscles of the leg you'd have to
adjust for if you just did quad stuff
like
adductors sartorius and glutes and
even within the quads even within the
quads right the knee extension is really
like it's going to hit that the vmo or
whatever you want to call it
the medial quad decently and then the
rest is kind of depends on if it's a
good
fit for you or not so there's a huge
swath of quad that you may not be
hitting at all
yeah we do recommend compound uh
squatting
style or pressing style quad movements
for maintenance because they hit
all that muscle and make sure that
because like if you just do leg
extensions you're physically your quads
or at least most of them won't recede in
size
but if that's really you do like
hamstring curls and extensions that's
all you do for your legs maybe you do a
glute something or other
you know you lose that exercise and then
you'll come back to squatting and be
like but my quads were maintained
how come i'm so much weaker because
there's other muscles involved so
yeah so i think he mentioned he was like
maybe dealing with some injury so i
would say like if you could do something
like a leg press
something that's manageable for yourself
where you're just getting a little bit
of a different look and not just doing
all
knees i think doing all knee extensions
would be like not
terrible but not great either if you
could have like one day that was like
okay i did some
like hack squats if that if if it's
tolerable or some leg press
great and then you could do knee
extensions on like your second session
per week or something and that would
that would be fine that would be like a
fine way to do it
but i would try to avoid and i have a
couple clients right now that they're
doing
mass phases and that's basically the
exact they're doing upper body focus
and their lower body is like one day
they do squats and like hamstring curls
and then one day they do like a stiff
leg a deadlift and like a knee extension
like you have like a heavy light kind of
split pretty easy
that's that's totally fine for
maintenance type stuff
that's it all right let's see any
announcements um
keep tuned on uh if you guys haven't
noticed on social media we
typically have been running some sales
on a lot of our ebooks so you can
usually grab
each week one or two uh books at a
pretty good price so if you want to i
think
pretty good you can do better than that
james a phenomenal unbelievable
as a book we're losing money here it's
on amazon so we don't actually lose any
money but um yeah check that out uh
let's see i we recorded the
audios for the hypertrophy book and for
the habits building and scott has sent
me those
files we're just doing our kind of final
quality checks on those so that might
not get posted for a minute just but
it's
in the works so that's moving along dr
mike you got anything going
youtube always more youtube shooting a
bunch of different stuff
um if you guys are interested in like
sociological type stuff and obesity and
stuff um
uh ethan sipley and i have a podcast
out on the american podcast about
the haze movement health at every size
and it's kind of pluses and minuses we
do like an
hour of the pluses and the things the
movement says that are really good
and like an hour of minuses like kind of
insane shit they say it makes no goddamn
sense
so if you're interested in that i would
check that out uh just american glutton
podcast
and give that a whirl i'm trying to
think is there any other
rp stuff that's coming around for now i
think that's about it
it's all just secret project work secret
projects that's right you need security
clearance folks
and you don't have it so for that reason
we're signing off
thanks for engaging with us this week
and we will talk to you next time
peace
