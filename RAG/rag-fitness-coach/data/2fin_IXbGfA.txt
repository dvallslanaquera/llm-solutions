morning guys it is Monday or wait it's
Tuesday night it's called Sparkling Hill
Resort it's like an hour outside of
Kelowna I just wanted to give you guys a
quick look at the view I'll give you a
full tour of the room after Duffy forgot
the bathing suit so we're gonna try to
pick one up at Walmart
yeah I know
that's crazy
oh great thank you
oh
[Music]
acted all all right
okay guys so here's breakfast and this
is what I've got this is Stephanie's and
this is what the view looks like so it's
very very nice
[Music]
so this is the hotel gym it's Stephanie
The View I guess from the cardio
equipment oh wow it actually counts your
repetitions that's a lot of
the resistance
it's more fluid because it's not a plate
I don't love it but I'll use it
oh wait is that jacking it up more yeah
okay hold up okay hold on girl let's see
how strong you are
trying to show off now and then
never seen anything like it in my life
like a pressurized only Germans would
make things
get that out oh you know
no they're all compression do they all
make fun noises
get back down okay yeah so strange we're
gonna do lower body stuff first so I'm
just gonna do a little warm-up on the
treadmill
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so yeah this is how this works it's
really different there's like a rep
count on this and then the resistance is
fully pressurized so you have to like
press this to turn up the resistance
like super light as a warm-up set
it's weird hey so weird
it feels like you're pushing like a yoga
ball like you're compressing a yoga ball
yeah that's actually a very good
description
let's go
[Music]
there you go
so what is um units for pressure pascals
yeah kilopascals Mercury today we're
going to be doing full body we did three
sets here 15 to 20 reps and then we did
the hamstring curl machine right here
again 15 to 20 reps but one of the
important things that I really try to
focus on when traveling is
her body part I'm not going to worry
about sticking to my 17 when I'm in
different gyms I like to try out
different pieces of equipment and kind
of just have fun it's no problem to do
that every now and then what I try to
focus on is taking at least a set of
each exercise to failure that's usually
the last one and that ensures that all
the motor units are being activated
that's a way to sort of like make up for
the lack of volume it's like when you
have a higher volume training to failure
is less important when you have a lower
volume training
I went on the road and just for doing
full body training or whatever
um I think the training failure is a
good idea oftentimes when people go on
the road they don't have the ability to
train quite as frequently depending on
how long your trip is it might be a
smarter idea to go with a full body
for a lower split rather than say like a
push or a final price split 16. come on
make me look like a little [ __ ]
that was easy for you
[Music]
I'm gonna do one exercise for chest to
do this machine right here and we're
going to do a shoulder press in this
machine right here I think I'm gonna do
pull-ups uh for back almost like when
you first lift during the first two ABS
or something would be like kind of like
super shaky
I feel like the resistance curve is so
unique that all my steel glasses are
just not used to stabilizing its way but
it's less so as a week gets heavier so
as I drag the resistance up it feels a
little bit easier
[Music]
wait oh my God this is a pull down
this is the resistance is the opposite
way oh so it's back oh
because it lifts like this does right
the hamstring yeah
oh that's really neat
[Music]
another thing I was going to mention
when it comes down to rep count if
you're taking sets to failure the number
of reps that you do is less important I
think it is a good idea to train at
least have some sort of heavy movements
in your routine oftentimes if it's New
pieces of equipment like this it usually
ends up being a little bit of a higher
rep workout in this case pretty much
everything we've done has been about 12
to 20 reps or so so watch me
watch me
get louder
get louder
watch me
[Music]
it's like you reach failure but it's
like the weirdest kind of failure like
it's like halfway through it starts to
break down and that's like super easy
[Music]
for our last exercise we're gonna hit
some shoulders we're gonna do a standing
arm press which is where your palms face
in at the bottom and then as you press
overhead you rotate them outward and I
like to do these standing because
standing shoulder presses have been
shown to have more lateral depth EMG
activity than their seed counterpart and
I feel like I should say I don't put a
ton of weight in EMG I don't think that
EMG should determine exactly what you do
but I think it should be a supplement
too basic biomechanics basic exercise
science and if you're torn between
exercises then EMG is a good resource to
use
[Music]
that's a good album
those are hard
I think like km e i p p and basically
you walk around here in the like
temperature of the water is different as
you walk along stepping through warm and
cold water can help uh relieve poor
circulation low blood pressure insomnia
hot and swollen feet yeah I've never
tried anything like this before well we
just trained so I feel like now would be
a good time to do it
oh the star oh that's that's good
because I'm cold yeah should I take off
the road
I kind of wanna I wanna skip this part
[Applause]
oh
and then it just burns when you get in
the hot again
oh
[Applause]
okay wait this one is like lukewarming
no it's cold
it's not as cool
that was the deck section
my circulation is just fine I don't have
swollen feet I'm good
[Music]
[Music]
just finished up at the spa and now
we're here at dinner this place is like
super quiet it's like literally just us
so I guess it's really nice people don't
usually go on vacations like in the
middle of the week I guess so now we're
just trying to decide what to get this
is the appetizer right here it's the
ravioli stuff I'm gonna try this stay
tuned for the rating
so yeah this is very good predict the
rating
9.5 you think it's time to give that a
9.5 number 10 everything
no everything has to be perfect
I had them made up in my mind ahead of
time
which is a very good rating one thing
that knocks it down 1.5 off of that is
that it's literally dripping in oil like
there's literally so much oil soba
noodle Thai coconut chicken dish Cod
yeah sure
so when we had dinner we're really
really not so good so we were actually
really hungry so we just looked up the
cheap Thai place and we're eating Thai
food now that is likely a passing grade
food all I want is a five she's half
Thai half French Canadian and So she
recommends
Tom cocky
this honestly smells like butt who knows
that could mean it tastes really good
you better be good give it a four number
one two three four five between the two
of us
[Music]
you
have to be honest can't be nice
for Pad Thai and give it like a three oh
[ __ ] there's no Spice Girl whatsoever
yeah
oh damn that's brutal I only give it a
six and a half but now I feel like
it was a it was a good night and it was
fun like we didn't have a good dinner
but like we just kind of made the most
of it or whatever we actually extended
our stay here for one more night when
vlogging and like training like we do
and stuff it's like it's kind of like
working even though it's a lot of fun so
I decided it would be nice to have one
day where I wasn't gonna Vlog and we
could just like enjoy the resort or
whatever as for the dish and everything
I feel satisfied I'm at least full I
