if you do those basic things you train
with proper form
and sufficient effort and you gradually
progressively overload your chest is
going to grow
very very effectively without the need
for any of these uh fancy gimmicks that
are so common in the fitness industry
nowadays
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i'm going to be going over
eight different chest exercises that
i've seen pretty commonly posted across
youtube and social media
some of them unfortunately by people
with very large followings who are going
to end up
misleading their audience because of it
but these are exercises that i
definitely think you should avoid either
because they are less effective than
other more basic alternatives
or they're flat out dangerous or both
now there are
a ton of low-quality chest exercise
variations floating out there nowadays
uh you know as everybody competes in the
fitness space to show the most
innovative and most
unique lifts that they possibly can to
bring in those juicy clicks
so i couldn't possibly cover all of them
but this is a collection of eight that
stand out
and then later on i'll explain what i
think are the best chest exercises to
include
uh in your chest workout for optimal
results now if you're new here don't
forget to hit that subscribe button
below to stay in the loop on all of my
latest
no bs content give the video a like if
you want to see more content from me
where i break down specific exercises
and let's get started all right number
one on the list of
lame chest exercises is the standing
plate pinch press
otherwise known as the svend press now
the problem with this lift is that even
though
it might really feel like it's working
your chest it really isn't to a
significant degree and that's because
even though you're pressing the weight
forward and back
gravity is pulling the weight straight
down toward the floor rather than
back toward your body like it needs to
be so it's basically just like
holding your arms at the top of a front
delt raise
now i think uh plate presses in general
are just a pretty weak exercise
regardless
but if you did want to do this so that
it was at least working your chest
through its primary function then you
need to be laying down and pressing the
weight upward
with the standing version it's basically
just an isometric contraction
from having to pinch those plates
together and it's kind of deceiving or
not kind of deceiving it's it is
deceiving
because since you're squeezing your
hands together so tightly it's gonna
feel
like your chest is really getting hit
hard but even if you just sit there
right now and do this with no weight at
all just put your arms straight out and
press your hands together um as hard as
you can you're gonna feel
a similar level of tension on your chest
um just in the same way that if you were
to sit there and
flex your bicep as hard as you can it's
gonna feel like they're under a lot of
stress too even though they're not
moving against any actual
resistance so this is an example of why
the mind muscle connection can be
misleading like i've talked about before
because feeling stress on the muscle
doesn't necessarily correlate
to how much actual mechanical tension
that muscle is
under so even though certain fitness
experts out there might include
the pinch press in their list of best
chest exercises
the standing plate press is definitely
one that i would say you should skip
over
next up is the swiss ball press and this
is also sometimes done
using a bosu ball as well now there's
just no good reason at all to perform
your free weight presses using a swiss
ball or a bosu ball
some people think that by adding that
instability aspect that it somehow
improves the functionality of the
exercise which
really is just nonsense okay the goal
here is to achieve maximum chest
stimulation
and so you want your upper back to be
driving against a solid surface
so that you can protect your shoulders
and generate maximum force against the
weight
there's just no advantage to using an
exercise ball for your chest presses
and if you actually want to get in a
proper chest workout that is both safe
and effective
just do your presses on a normal bench
third on the list now some people are
not going to like this one because
it's kind of an old school chest
exercise that some coaches do still
promote
but that is the guillotine press which
is basically a barbell bench press
but instead of lowering the weight to
your chest with your elbows tucked
you're instead going to use a very wide
grip flare your elbows right up to the
sides and lower the bar
down to your neck now from a pure muscle
building standpoint this
actually is an effective movement and it
does shift the line of pull
onto your pecs nicely however with any
exercise that you're doing you always
have to weigh out the risk and reward
and with the guillotine press there are
two major issues
so the first is the obvious fact of
lowering the bar to your neck
now that might not be an issue for a
more advanced lifter
but still you know you can never predict
with certainty what might happen in the
middle of any given set
and if you were to tweak something
mid-rep or underestimate your strength
with a certain weight
having that bar directly in line with
your throat is probably
less than ideal and then the second
issue is that by flaring your elbows out
at 90 degree angles
you're going to be placing a lot more
stress on your shoulder joints in
comparison to having
your elbows tucked in now some people
might be totally fine with the
guillotine press
and not have any issues at all as long
as they go lighter and they really
control the movement
but the bottom line is that there are
just much better and safer options for
chest training
and even if the guillotine press did
provide a small bit of extra stimulation
for the chest i really don't think
the risk of the exercise justifies that
in most cases
for example on a chest fly technically
if you brought your arms
as far back behind your body as you
could you'd actually get a fuller range
of motion and a better stretch on your
pecs
but the reason we don't do that is
because the extra range of motion
isn't worth the extra stress on the
shoulders so
always consider risk and reward and with
this exercise i would say that the
ratio definitely leans more to the risky
side to where i think it's just best
to use other alternatives and guys if

below all right number four is another
chest exercise that i've been seeing
more and more of
on social media and it's not that this
exercise doesn't work but it's just less
efficient and there's really no
added advantage to it and that is the
alternating dumbbell press
which is just a regular dumbbell press
except instead of pressing both
dumbbells at the same time
you're going to alternate back and forth
between each side again this is one of
those lifts that
looks cool and unique and i've seen tons
of fitness influencers out there
including this
in their instagram swipe workouts but in
reality there's really just no point to
it you know some people think that it's
going to give them
a better core workout because they'll be
slightly off balance but since you have
a weight in both hands
that opposite weight is going to act as
a counterbalance and so that mostly
negates
the core strength aspect of it and all
this exercise really does is just
prolong your set
and divert your attention because you're
going to have to focus on pressing the
weight with one hand
while balancing that other weight above
your face okay we're trying to build
muscle here
we are not trying to audition for cirque
du soleil
and you can even argue that this makes
the exercise slightly less effective
for your chest because holding that one
dumbbell in the extended position
is going to fatigue your shoulders and
triceps somewhat uh in between
reps if you really want to do this
variation for some reason then you can
okay i'm not saying that it won't work
um it will train your chest but as far
as i'm concerned there's just no reason
at all
to not just do a standard dumbbell or
barbell press
and press both hands at the same time
number five i've seen this one pop up
quite a few times especially from
a certain popular instagram fitness
account who basically specializes in
uploading useless exercise variations
and that is a chest press using an
assisted pull-up machine pad as
resistance
and the problem here is that you have
nothing to drive your back against and
so that's going to significantly
decrease the amount of force that you
can generate with your chest now maybe
if you were doing this with
really light weight for high reps it
wouldn't be quite as bad but all in all
there are just
infinitely better options and i don't
see any reason at all to waste your time
with this exercise
number six is going to be any form of a
basic lying chest press or chest fly
but using weight plates for resistance
so whether it's this
or this or this
if you want to maximize chest
stimulation using a free weight press
there's no reason to not just use a
basic barbell or a pair of dumbbells
okay if it's not broken
don't fix it and using weight plates
doesn't provide you with any extra
advantage
all it really does is just make the
exercise more awkward more dangerous and
harder
to progressively overload as well
there's no need to get fancy or try to
reinvent the wheel here
good old-fashioned barbell and dumbbell
presses are going to be enough to fully
get the job done when it comes to free
weight presses as long as you're holding
a dumbbell in each hand
and not doing stupid stuff like this so
that's six chest exercises so far
um i've got two more here but just to be
clear these last two are not
bad chest exercises they're just
exercises that are really bad when you
perform them incorrectly and that can
have serious consequences in terms of
injury and so i wanted to add these in
here as well since i very commonly see
people do these wrong
so exercise number seven very very
common and that's going to be
excessively heavy barbell bench presses
i can't even count the number of times
that i've been in the gym and watched in
disappointment as someone loads up way
more weight than they can actually
handle
and then proceeds to pump out sloppy
lopsided half reps while their spotter
assists them on every single rep
the barbell bench press is not a
mandatory chest exercise but it is a
solid movement overall as long as you do
it correctly
so that means using a weight that you
can lift under complete control for full
range of motion reps
no not half reps on the smith machine
okay as long as your shoulders are
otherwise healthy then you can bring the
bar all the way down to your chest
and you need to be able to do it without
the help of a spotter and using proper
lifting technique of course
now if you try to progress too quickly
and go too heavy just to
try and satisfy your ego or to try to
impress other people in the gym who
ultimately don't care how much weight
you can lift anyway then your shoulders
are definitely going to pay for it not
to mention that your reputation in the
gym is also going to pay for it because
you really just look like
a complete tool when you're sloppily
heating around weights that you clearly
have no business lifting and chest
exercise
number eight this one is probably even
more dangerous and that's going to be
excessively heavy weighted dips
so these will beat the ever living dog
crap out of your shoulders over time
if you're not careful dips are an
effective movement for stimulating your
chest
if you use a wider grip and you lean
forward slightly and if your body
structure is well suited to them
but if you are going to do them make
sure that you're using a weight that you
can lift under complete control
only lower yourself until your upper
arms are roughly parallel to the floor
and don't go to all-out failure either
so that's today's list of
lame chest exercises and now to finish
off what would i say
are the best chest exercises that you
can do now i know a lot of people out
there are looking for
special breakthrough tips and tricks for
this but in reality effective
chest exercise selection is pretty
straightforward
the chest is not as large of a muscle as
most people think its function is
fairly simple as well and there are
ultimately a pretty wide variety of
acceptable movements that you can do
now i'm not going to go through and
demonstrate all of these exercises in
detail because
most of you are already going to be
familiar with them i am planning to
start doing
live exercise demonstration videos in
the gym starting in the new year
but i'm still working on getting a
videographer for that and setting up the
gym logistics as well
so for today this will mostly just be a
verbal explanation and you can easily
look these exercises up as well if you
do need to learn the proper technique
so in terms of primary chest exercises
a basic barbell press and or dumbbell
press
that is what i would recommend using as
your main go-to lift you don't
necessarily have to do both
um you can if you want i personally have
always favored dumbbells and i rarely
did barbell presses
because dumbbells just felt a lot
smoother for me but using one of those
as your core compound chest exercise
that's going to be a pretty safe bet
flat incline or decline angles are all
acceptable but i would generally favor
flat or
incline since that decline angle can be
a bit more awkward and the range of
motion is going to be shorter as well
so the flat angle will shift a bit more
emphasis on to the middle and lower
sternocostal fibers of the pecs whereas
the incline is going to shift a bit more
focus
to the upper clavicular fibers now aside
from free weight presses
machine presses are also acceptable okay
there's nothing wrong with using
machines
and they can even have certain
advantages depending on the movement
so that could be a hammer press or just
any other basic machine press
that feels comfortable for you a seated
cable press is also a really solid
exercise that i like
the one advantage here being that the
cable is going to pull your arms
both back and out to the sides and so
you're going to get a stronger
contraction at the top of the lift
because of that
especially if you do them one arm at a
time and weighted push-ups are also a
solid movement too
if you enjoy them and if you have an
easy way to add resistance now after
your presses are finished
you can then include a fly movement of
some kind or more than one fly it really
depends on how your program is set up
but honestly pretty much any basic fly
variation is ultimately going to be
acceptable
as long as you're using a full range of
motion and the movement feels
comfortable for you
now i don't think flies are absolutely
mandatory you can definitely build a
very solid chest without them
i personally never did flies for the
first few years of my own training and i
did just fine without them
but they can be a good way to just get
some extra volume in for the pecs in a
more isolated way
while producing less overall body
fatigue in comparison
to heavy presses so that could be a
simple dumbbell fly
again flat incline or even decline is
fine a seated or standing cable fly
pressing from high to low or low to high
depending on what area of the chest you
want to emphasize or a machine fly is
great as well the one advantage to
cables and machines
is that they do train the pecs through a
slightly larger range of motion in
comparison to dumbbells
since with dumbbells you aren't going to
get as much stress in that top position
because of the way
that the force of gravity is pulling but
overall i think that the difference here
is probably going to be pretty minor um
and technically speaking
the machine fly is actually the one that
places the chest under maximum stress
at all points in the range of motion so
when it comes to flies
my suggestion is to just experiment and
find the variations that you personally
prefer
so to sum this all up okay depending on
your program structure
a pretty safe template would be to pick
one to two pressing movements
and one to two fly movements so two to
four chest exercises
in total for the week and how exactly
you lay that out
again it really just depends on your
program do a basic
barbell or dumbbell press as your main
movement if you're going to do two
presses then the second one
can also be a barbell or dumbbell press
but just at a different angle or it
could be another type of press
like a machine press or a cable press
and then for flies i would say just pick
whatever movements you most prefer
and as an overall guideline for your
chest training in general ideally try to
incorporate at least
one flat or decline angle and one
incline angle to make sure that you're
targeting
uh the entire pec muscle from top to
bottom if you do those basic things
you train with proper form and
sufficient effort and you gradually
progressively overload your chest is
going to grow
very very effectively without the need
for any of these fancy gimmicks that are
so common in the fitness industry
nowadays
