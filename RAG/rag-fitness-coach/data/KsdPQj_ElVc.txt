hey folks dr mike ezratal here for
renaissance periodization
nutrition myths got a whole series for
you here's video number one
calories don't matter what
so we're gonna do four things today and
this is going to be the pattern repeated
through this series
we're going to talk about what the claim
actually is to make sure it's mythical
then we're going to talk about why it's
wrong
but after that we're going to cut it
some slack because there are grains of
truth to almost every myth so we're
gonna accept those
make sure that they're out there and
then lastly we're gonna finish with best
practices
to make sure that uh you know we're not
just crapping on myths which is fun
but also that we're leaving guys with
some helpful advice okay this is wrong
but where do we go from here
so without further ado the claim
that calories don't matter is usually
not a technical thermodynamics claim in
a you know
food sciences laboratory it's usually a
claim that calories don't determine fat
loss someone will say hey i'm trying to
lose fat someone also say hey like you
know you probably
should count your calories and someone
else comes in and goes oh don't do that
because calories have nothing to do with
fat loss people actually say this and
they actually mean it
often like a lot a lot all right now
they don't usually
say this and follow up with well there's
nothing you can do about fat loss
because nothing affects it
for good reason they don't say that they
have alternative ideas about what causes
fat loss
such as hormones such as food choices
how your nutrient timing is and many
many many other things
so a lot of times the food choice is the
real big one they'll say well it's these
kinds of foods that affect your hormones
like this
that make you fat but if you eat these
other kinds of foods that are not bad
foods then you won't get fat and you can
eat as many of those as you like
uh you know interesting claim we'll
examine that in a second
and another very related claim is that
calorie counting as a process
itself doesn't work uh not exactly the
same claim because
some of the folks that say calorie
counting doesn't work do admit that
calories matter but that people just
aren't good at counting calories and
there's a lot more validity than that
but nonetheless people really do think
calories don't matter
so let's examine why that is probably
incorrect to put it charitably
we can think of at least four reasons
reason number one
body weight is determined in the long
term especially
tissue size because water weight can
fluctuate the amount of tissue you have
in your body is determined exclusively
by calorie balance
exclusively there's nothing else that
determines it
what composition your tissues are muscle
versus fat now that's different that's
not just calories other stuff plays a
role
but the total amount of tissue you have
is calories so if someone weighs 600
pounds
they're in an excess calorie state all
the time
that is the only way to get to weighing
600 pounds of
actual tissue now this fact is
laboratory confirmed okay first of all
which means
that they've done direct studies with
all kinds of different diets and when
they make the right calorie adjustments
people lose weight very predictably or
gain weight very predictably or maintain
it
exactly to prediction the reason this
works is point number you know 2 sub 2
here
is that it is governed by the laws of
thermodynamics which as we have yet
been able to illustrate and macro
phenomena that are not quantum based
thermodynamic processes are never
violated never have been at least yet
be real curious if someone did now
there's a bunch of other
studies and observations that sort of
corroborate this evidence
one thing you guys can google for
yourself is the twinkie study by dr mark
hobb
and he was a researcher in the kansas
area and a university professor
actually the chair of the nutrition
department where dr
jen case of rp got her phd in human
nutrition
and he was basically getting like not
harassed but kind of razzed by his
coworkers
because he was the head of the nutrition
department and he would have like a
healthy lunch
that they would bring to meetings and he
would also have a couple snack cakes
like twinkie
or ho ho or whatever and you know
usually of course
other people from other departments
would be like oh dr hob you sure you
could have that i thought you were the
nutrition professor and he's like
actually it's totally healthy
to eat a little bit of junk food here
and there as long as your calorie
balance is in order like i don't know
about that so he got frustrated and he
did a little pilot experiment on himself
where he ate almost exclusively snack
cakes like legit little debbie snack
cakes
twinkies ho ho's all delicious stuff
delicious for one or two bites and then
you're like why the hell am i eating
this
he did that for a few months he also had
a little tiny bit of vegetables just to
get his micronutrients in and for
protein and more micronutrients he had a
little bit of skim milk on the side
other than that the fast preponderance
me 80 90 of his calories
came from snack cakes what ended up
happening was he lost exactly as much
weight as he predicted and every single
blood marker of his health
improved holy crap so when people say
well it's the foods you eat it's not the
calories
twinkie study is an awfully awfully
interesting thing to read after that
and things we're not just relying on out
relying on tons of lab experience
and the basic laws of thermodynamics so
it's a thing calories do matter and in
fact if calories didn't matter
how would that even work so for example
if you weigh 150 pounds and you want to
be 175 and jacked
how do you gain to 175 without extra
physical energy again that violates laws
and thermodynamics
you have extra matter in your body where
did it come from
right where'd it come from you can't eat
the same amount of food
that kept you at 150 and have the
activity be the same
thus your calorie balance and get to
175. how does that work where does stuff
come from
right it's like having a skyscraper
halfway constructed and there's tons of
bricks in in one of the yards down the
street
like yeah we're not going to ship any
more bricks engineers are like
how are we supposed to build a
skyscraper burger i don't know figured
out okay raw materials have to be a part
if you're going to make something bigger
period there's no other way and calories
are just a representation of
how much raw material you have secondly
another weird scenario that we would see
that we never do
is if calories really don't matter
perhaps if you could eat the right kinds
of foods
you could subsist on 500 calories a day
and not starve
can you imagine going to a
famine-stricken area
and there's people out there like
begging for food and you're like
you don't need more calories what you
need is avocado
just a small amount to get your hormones
settled you'll be fine that's
nonsense right so it's straight up
doesn't work
and it's not that the idea just doesn't
work or crapping on it it has
negative effects for example it
leads people into dangerous
misunderstandings if you are willing to
suspend disbelief
and assume that calories don't matter
good god your toolbox of understanding
how to diet
and make sense of the world is kind of
gone
i mean i don't know what you're thinking
at that point you probably don't either
it's like telling someone you know you
don't really need a resistance train
to get bigger muscles like weight
doesn't need to be challenging or heavy
uh your muscles don't need to face a
challenge to get hypertrophy you'd be
like
okay so you go to a seminar and some bad
head scientist tells you that
okay and you go home you're like how am
i supposed to lift am i simple do i have
to lift weights
how do i get big i mean these are one of
the pinnacle pinnacle facts
of physiology we're just tossing out it
leaves people confused
and worse still it leads them to abandon
core good dieting principles and go
fad to fat to fat trying to search for
those magic foods
avoiding the calorie problem and what
are they going to be doing
they're going to be searching for those
magic foods forever because drumroll
they don't exist
so it's not a good situation now some of
the stuff
about calories not mattering does have
grains of truth around it there is a
silver lining
for example the types of foods you
consume
it's not all calories per even numbers
of calories
the types of foods you choose to fill
those calories can have a big
differential effect on muscle
versus fat so if you eat more protein
that's better it makes you more muscular
less fat
more fiber is better and oftentimes for
bulking purposes and cutting purposes
slightly lower intakes of fats
more intakes of protein and carbs how
most bodybuilders eat
are better so if you're telling someone
well
calories don't matter because you have
to eat really good foods they do matter
and the really good foods matter to
determine not just body weight
body composition because not so many
people care a ton
how much they weigh it turns out they
just really care about how they look
right so like if you gave someone
who weighed let's say a female who
weighs 180 pounds at five foot two
and you're like oh that's a hefty that's
i have to get out there all right
and you tell her look like we have this
experimental procedure we shoot you with
these zeta rays don't worry
they're safe the test monkeys love them
you shoot the girl with zeta rays and
the result
is she weighs the same 180 we literally
step on a scale and like straight up
x-men wolverine style adamantium
skeleton in like step on the shit like
holy crap
but her body externally looks and
feels exactly like someone who weighs
120 pounds
okay little abs low arm chisel
shape how many people given that the
procedure
le procedure is safe okay let's see it's
actually safe not just that the monkeys
haven't died yet
um how many people be like nah nah
that's not for me there's no way i can
weigh 180.
i feel like a ton of people not everyone
but a ton to be like
i get to look like that be like yes and
you have all the strength and energy if
someone's 120
you physically weigh 180 but you're not
going to feel like it you can jump up
and down
wolverine wolverine okay how many people
be like nah
tons of people are like yeah i'll take
that
because people fundamentally care about
how they look not how much they weigh
so a lot of times when people say
calories didn't work for me they counted
calories they lowered their calories
they ate mostly crappy foods they lost
some muscle a lot of muscle
some fat then they look like a smaller
version of themselves and like
okay you know i have this idea when you
start a fat loss diet and start training
that you're going to like get there's a
chiseled situation and then you just end
up looking like a smaller
version of your fat cells your skinny
fat now and it's like this is not what i
had in mind but then
they stop paying attention to calories
they start getting more protein
more veggies more whole grains they
start weight training maybe
more physical activity all of a sudden
they regain some weight
so they went from 180 to one set like
well let's say 155 and they look like
kind of blah they are blah bear
they regain up to 165 and they lost tons
more fat
gained muscle their body shape is
excellent some of those folks might be
like well see calories don't matter
they do it's just this stuff also
matters as well
big big important points number two
point to
sort of why people may think this food
timing
uh can determine energy for activity
okay food
composition and the timing if you eat
like one meal of donuts you just go to
sleep right after
but four meals of the same calories
spread over the day of protein carbs and
fats and healthy stuff
veggies can keep you active and feeling
amazing so when you tell someone look
calories are king and they super matter
okay so hypothetically i should be able
to just eat donuts all day but if i eat
the right amount
i'll lose weight and they're like well
yeah yeah lose weight but you won't have
any energy to move around so then you
won't lose weight because your calories
out is different
it's a bag of cats and also if someone
tries a diet that says look calories
don't matter
but when that person does that wrote the
diet for them as they make them mean
healthy foods
first of all a lot of times the calories
will be lower because there's only so
much healthy food you can get we'll get
that
to that in a sec but also they have so
much energy feels so great
that they're like yeah well calories
don't matter i tried this diet that
wasn't calorie based and i felt the best
ever so calories don't matter erroneous
conclusion but you can see where they're
coming from on that
another one foods have a big effect on
health a lot of times you tell people
calories are a huge effect on health
because if you shrink down it's better
like okay i'm going to eat pink twinkies
and pizza and shrink down
but what about healthy foods like
there's something there there absolutely
is something there even if you're eating
same amount of calories if the food
composition is better your health
improves more
so we tell people calories matter we're
never saying it's the only thing that
matters it's absolutely true
the more lean proteins veggies fruits
whole grains healthy fats and a little
bit less junk your health is going to
improve at
any level of calories period now that
any level of calories is the next point
point number four
if you eat mostly healthy foods what you
end up doing is
just satiating yourself that much more
which is to say
that if i give you a bunch of healthy
food and i give you a thousand calories
of it
you're gonna go through it it's gonna
take you half an hour to eat you'll be
like oh my god
oh my god that was that was fine but
like i don't want to eat for four hours
and for four hours you're gonna have
tons of energy you're not gonna wanna
eat
a couple meals like that and you're into
let's say 3 000 calories
over the day which might be a deficit
for you and you're losing weight you
feel full you have tons of energy
amazing but if you try to eat a thousand
calories of super junk food i mean you
guys know how it is friday and saturday
nights are a thing
you zip through that shit so fast that
you're like oh that was a thousand
calories
i can eat right now as a matter of fact
i think i'm hungrier after eating that
and certainly a few hours later you're
ready to eat again and you want super
tasty foods again because a lot of those
foods
that are junky they make you want more
of them like nobody has
a couple scoops of ice cream or sorry a
couple maybe some people can stop after
a couple of scoops not me
uh a couple spoonfuls of ice cream and
they're like i'm good okay just don't do
that
right how many people like have one or
two potato chips they're like that's it
for me
you know stomach's really small get out
of here a lot of those foods that are
super high calorie super junky
they're easy to eat and just get way
carried out of hand and you just want
more of them
so all of a sudden you're trying to eat
3 000 calories a day
but if you do that with just junk foods
you get super hungry super low on energy
and it sucks then you end up eating more
and then you're eating 4 000 which is no
longer a deficit and you're like oh man
like i thought calorie balance was the
thing well it's much harder to pull off
if you don't control the quality of your
foods
making your calories lower is way easier
if you eat the right food so it's not
calories matter
only its calories matter in addition to
other variables but they don't never
not matter now
all of these effects change the result
from the same calorie diet a lot
so what that means is especially if you
take adherence into account
folks that are experimenting with only
counting calories because i know people
still do this sometimes
they'll get on my fitness pal or
something which can be used very very
properly and
not so properly and they'll just count
calories and they won't focus on any
kinds of foods and a lot of times they
don't succeed with dieting or they don't
really get impressive results because
just calorie counting
in the context of still eating not so
great foods which doesn't work all that
well
because you're essentially just turning
everything against yourself
it's kind of like trying to drive a race
car with a really powerful engine
but the steering is rudimentary it sucks
there's there's no electronics
whatsoever there's barely any
a mirror to look back front side and all
you know the brakes are sticky
it's like yeah okay the fundamental the
huge engine's there but there's a lot
more to a race car
in its performance than just the engine
so if we include the same calories
and even maybe lower calories we eat
more healthy foods have good meal timing
eat the right macronutrients all of a
sudden
it's like this whiz easy process that
just happens
you do it do it do it you get these
great results it's like a race car with
a great same great engine
but all the fancy works the little lane
indicators to when you swerve out of a
lane steer
assist all that stuff it gives you the
best possible advantages
so take them when we say calories matter
they do but
other stuff matters too it's not either
or
it's both it's not a single factor
so when we say calories matter just know
that other things matter as well and
folks that are super sharp on the
internet on instagram and stuff
the science crowd they usually don't
just say hey calories matter shut up
usually they say hey calories matter but
here's some other stuff that can help
you
hit the calories you need and help you
in multiple other ways
those are the ways the following if you
focus on mostly
nutritious healthy foods control portion
sizes
you will get the result that you're
after if at any point during that time
you start to ignore calories
you will not see the kind of fat loss or
muscle gain you want
so the real ticket is to eat very well
and then take that while eating and
adjust its calories up and down as
needed
not to eat like shit and then just be
like blob off calories okay that's not
sustainable it's not the best way
forward
first choose the best stuff choose good
timing
and then alter its calories which is
pretty easy because you can't eat a lot
of that stuff anyway
and you'll get the results you need
folks that's it for this myth see you
next time for the next myth
you
