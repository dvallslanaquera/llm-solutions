slow up up
done good job
[Music]
hey folks Dr Mike here foreign Jared
feather here for round of sound
spiritization as well and we're here
with our friend Cameron and he uh this
is kind of is backstory he's Jared's
friend
and he made a terrible mistake he
started lifting weights at some point
and I like I he's now he's on the
channel about to do legs and luckily
well not luckily for him he is Jewish so
you wanna yo what up family
but now the past where that is
you nervous yet uh yeah it's like a a
Make-a-Wish but I'm not terminally ill
you will be soon let's start leg
training
thank you
thank you
what you're working with
front 225 not a lot of cues today I
guess 135 on
I just gotten that's perfect I got
another say
hopefully I can make myself useful or
just stand around and be like yep good
job 225 is top 225 top so when you're
weak as shit you can do high RSM
movements first
kind of damn what a piece of shit
what a ruthless asshole why would you
say some shit like that because we're
all friends here because you got to be
mean to your friends
Mike people have been watching the
channel for a while they know we're mean
to our friends oh motherfucker you media
our friends two anxiety poops this
morning so solid Hey listen just do your
best no pressure at all honestly fake
the rir if you have to like I do
[Music]
[Applause]
first thing we're going to do today
is do high bar
strict weightlifting style squats with a
wedge probably throw a pause in there as
well this is sets of five to ten really
more like seven to ten reps that nasty
high tension stimulus at the beginning
we're going to be watching our technique
Cameron's going to be staying super
upright he's going to be tilting his
hips back but then his knees are going
to fall really far forward while his
heels are pressed into the wedge it is
going to be a slow eccentric control
we're gonna get everything done right
this is going to be heavy not as heavy
as it gets in bodybuilding but with good
technique only
[Music]
speed
holy shit all right you want a side spot
dear whatever you good yeah yeah thank
God your act that's good
good stop Cameron is actually a
competitive classic physique athlete
we'll call it athlete we'll call it a
sport I coached him to his last show
he's currently massing on his own and
working on his weak points legs are one
of those this is why he wanted to film a
lake session with us so he's going
through this current massing phase I
believe he's in his last massing Mesa
cycle so the end of the massing block uh
before he goes into maintenance and then
a show prep it's been about a year a
year and a half since he's competed last
time uh so we're gonna see what we can
do today really uh cap off this last
massing face for him and then hopefully
me and him are prepping again together
soon and we can display the I think it
was legs and back or what he needed to
work on so display that on stage here in
the next year or so
yep all day
quads camera we'll just
the chest heels
one more
we're right here
we just stand up Cameron
beautiful beautiful
good stuff all right hit it again I'm
just kidding
Let's pause
Jesus it's like the same the same
diameter as my the bottom of my car yeah
bigger bigger even yeah
all right folks 225 four sets of well
technically eight to ten eight to nine
and now one down set at 185 pounds
hopefully getting over 10 that's kind of
the goal here we'll see what uh cameras
capable of we're gonna push him but push
him into the context of good technique
only and then after that we are going to
go do leg extensions superset and two
walking lunges for quads
pain you guys see that on the horizon oh
that's pain that's pain it's it's gonna
be here real soon
[Applause]
when you get in trouble look up save it
until then
[Music]
look up yes one more one more one more
one more one more one more get his feet
right take your time grind this fucking
one let's go all you all fucking day
look up yes good shit wow
yeah all right I'm sorry all right all
right
[Music]
oh hey holy fucking shit
let me out Mike for a second yeah get
out
[Music]
um
okay hold on hold on leg extensions
as soon as he hits real close to failure
on these
probably failure we're gonna Usher him
out and he's gonna do walking lunges
with a completely upright upper body to
make sure their focus is really on the
quads it's going to be very painful
probably sets of 10 to 20 on both
not even sure about that second exercise
though could be a set of three and then
he falls over but uh multiple sets here
the goal with leg extensions is quality
so we're never banging them away it's a
slow eccentric lowering pause at the
bottom every rep that pause is awful
because with the prime leg extension it
stretches you the most at the bottom
painful pause up at the top no pause at
the top but just a quick Loop into that
top position in order to register that
you did hit full range of motion for
full muscular development Etc but we're
really milking that end range and you
guys know a bunch of studies came out
that show the end range is better the
top range well the prime leg extension
machine has a setting in which you can
bias the end range amazing amazing for
us to theorize about very terrible for
Cameron who's going to die soon pray for
Cameron hashtag pay for camera let's do
it up oh my God that's it good job rest
very good very good very good very good
don't let Bree talk shit because she
tried doing these on camera

your night job stop telling people

[Music]
good job Kim
shut up I'm done I'm out
my heart it's like 180. oh
that was good stuff yeah thank you of
course we're not done yet motherfucker
get one ready
take your time
holy shit we done broke the this boy
cam has done four sets of squats
three sets of leg extension a large
superset he can't really walk so well
so we're gonna plug him in on the seated
leg curl machine and he's gonna do two
bio rep sets uh basically like each one
with probably two pauses that's a total
of like six mini sets which equates to
roughly about wow four sets of straight
set stimulus and uh and then and then
that's it you know when you do your
quads this hard first in the workout
hamstrings are usually gonna have to be
something you de-prioritize simply
because you don't have the systemic
energy to get it done and he's pretty
dead but he's still gonna get a good
stimulus definitely enough to progress
his hands a little bit next time he
trains he might have more of a ham
emphasis at the beginning quads at the
end kind of situation and yeah yeah
that's that let's look for really good
technique control eccentric full range
of motion let's get it popping
great one
last one
[Music]
yes rest
two begin
[Music]
go
one bonus one go when you're done
shit that's it good
[Music]
