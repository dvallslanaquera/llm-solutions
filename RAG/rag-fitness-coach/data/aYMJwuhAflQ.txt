we got all the time in the world for
crying let's fucking get it on I'll tell
you what I tell everyone the better your
Technique the harder it is the less you
gotta do
[Music]
what's your division of competition
also Wellness
what's your shit Matt yeah
I'll get it I'll take care of you don't
you worry um
I'm not gonna say watch
you good to go hey folks Dr Mike here
and uh well that's if you Pro Jared
feather as usual
today we have two special guests
tweet
and Kayla
Tui is a competitive
Wellness
I mean I'm talking about athlete and she
looks well what up
Kayla is a woman of international
mystery I was like hey uh do you compete
she said don't you worry about what I do
and I was like what division she's like
why don't you get out of my face about
that shit and I was like listen are we
cool and she's like yeah as long as you
don't get shank up in this motherfucker
she's a stab me I recovered luckily and
she doesn't even have shit to say you
want to find out about her good luck
but she's here to show us how real
training works
if she feels like it though maybe not
and the rational mystery
she's gonna do what she does we're gonna
do a workout that has glutes it has
hamstrings it has quads and it also has
a lot of pain
why don't you ladies worry about that
start worrying
so for stiff legged deadlifts we are
absolutely hitting the hams and the
glutes and the best way to do that is to
pre-stretch by making sure to anteriorly
tilt the pelvis you want to push that
butt back tummy out chest up and descend
Ultra slow there's going to be a
temptation to let your knees slide
forward don't do that keep your knees
back just slightly out of lockout that
will put unreal stress on your hands
you're going to feel deep stretching
pain when you do get a little bit into
that pain hold for a second and then
come back up that's the way to do these
sets of five to ten yeah let's do it
your chest the chest tight lower back
tight lower back tight lower back last
one big chest more close
Gentle Touch come back up
and then as if you're gonna do another
and just put it down big chest
slow
good oh
let's go two more slow
what up
gentle touch up good one more slow
that's open it's open open the way up
too up there you go as if another slow
chest up pop back slow and rack good job
yes on the way up yeah close
as if another
slow
big chest
yeah and that's it good stop lower back
good stop
this this will get your lower back on
part of the exercise
again go go go go go go go go slow slow
slow slow oh yeah Gentle Touch and up
fast and then as if another go down slow
pretend you got another one coming big
chest
yeah there you go slow Kayla slow
control control control
let go holy shit that was awesome wow
wow
very good
[Music]
front foot elevated Smith machine lunges
sounds like a lot of stuff and it is
but this is an excellent excellent glute
exercise
a couple of things to keep in mind here
one we Elevate the front foot to stretch
that front glute the most
that means the front loot is the target
that means your rear foot is going to be
used only for stabilization purposes all
of your weight as much of it as possible
is on that front foot don't get too shy
about using the rear foot but especially
on the way down just use it as a tiny
little point to control your weight and
on the way up if you need the help you
can use it a little bit but generally
speaking you want to use it as little as
possible it's really almost a single leg
movement this will stretch the living
crap out of your glutes all right one
last big piece of a device is go slow on
the way down fully stop at the bottom
give it a shot let's see how these
ladies do push off on that front leg not
that back leg back legs for stability
and only if you need an extra help
good especially on the way down gentle
on the back leg all in the front let's
go tweak last two reps here
up
last rep go right now slow control it
I'm right here it's not going to fall up
crap oh yeah oh shit have fun that was

factor that means something like a squat
