what you don't want to do is have a
super low level of activity just
basically sit on the couch all day
because then in order to lose weight at
the prescribed gate you want you're
going to have to dip your food so low
you start losing muscle just because of
that so a little bit counterintuitively
make sure you're plenty doing plenty of
cardio lifting weights aggressively and
often and having plenty of daily
activity
