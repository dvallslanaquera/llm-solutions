[Music]
cramper no
crap
he has like five hamstrings that's not
supposed to be the case i learned in
anatomy that it was only three
today is uh day five
uh of this week of training that will be
a friday
it's friday uh it's the last
uh leg day of this prep
hard leg day of the practice yeah we're
gonna
you know keep uh rir right around one
or so um nothing too crazy there's like
a
maybe not a mythology but a practice in
a lot of sports
of like the the linear peak
where it's like the classic example is
the rocky movies
like the last scene you see in a rocky
montage
is like him going as hard as he can and
the next scene is him like
in the warm-up room on the day of the
fight in the back of the ring like
all right let's get it done it's like
did he have a taper did he have a deload
because we're accumulating lots of
fatigue fatigue and bodybuilding is
especially deleterious
because if you're really highly
systemically fatigued and even locally
fatigued this works on a local level
your water retention goes up and that
actually interferes
also high levels of damage interfere
with your
body's ability to load glycogen into the
muscles that's a really really really
bad deal
because we want low extra cellular water
sorry
subcutaneous water and we want a high
degree of glycogen
and the question is well what are we
accomplishing by training extra hard
well it feels kind of cool it feels all
warrior and shit
but at the end of the day that shit for
was for two weeks ago it was for
even half a week ago it's for last month
it was for the whole press still going
hard but we're not pushing it to crazy
crazy limits like you've seen in some
other videos
because that time is over
that's it
[Music]
passing out
we're good yeah you guys might think
charlie almost passed out because of low
blood pressure
from being so lean for the show and that
might be correct but he really passed
out
or almost passed out because he's a wuss
he just can't handle it in here it's the
fire dragon fire scotty show them what
the dragon looks like
[Applause]
some belt squats high rep
rest pause probably with like three or
four
rest clauses per set
[Music]
let's get 10 straight two
three so the prior
meso uh i've had to this final one
during this prep i learned
the very hard way of how
trying to keeping up intensity and
volume
with what i had in line with my
maintenance or
mass phases can do
to you during prep every single set
i was pushing it but i was pushing it
because everything felt easy
i got to a point where yeah i was
hitting these pr's when i needed to
but i felt like complete death every
minute of my waking life
in addition to my sleeping time i
couldn't get very good sleep
i woke up constantly sleep was sporadic
and that was due to the increased
fatigue
i was feeling 22
23
2 more
[Applause]
[Music]
24. 25
go up
cramp or no cramp
i cried out you're not even breathing
heavy anymore man
yeah okay are you ready
i guess you get less rep that's fine
with me
my card is going to give out before
anything start with eight to ten here
controlled movements
for everyone that says like you need to
like give everything you have
you know especially the last few weeks
of prep i think
uh that's a little bit short-sighted
and do you really want to go into your
last few weeks of a show
at your weakest state your most
vulnerable states um
for injury and building ultra fatigue
which you know
for some people makes you hold on to
more body water
will just make you look worse on your
stage anyway
so pretty much during the last few weeks
of training your last mezzo into a prep
your main goals are pretty much going
start off your meso by
you know having enough volume and weight
to
get a solid pump uh and as the mezzo
progresses
you just wanna like slightly make small
little increases
in your pr's and it's a little bit of
weight here and there
uh don't go crazy you know once again
this is not time to hit like huge pr's
you just want to make sure that your
body's adapting uh to stimulus
and you're going to your show healthy
and you'll get injured
[Music]
let's go nice and upright charlie
beautiful slow gentle touch
there you go
let's go control hit it
excellent
slow yes
that's it yeah
that was uh the end of
my last leg session of prep
um you know i had some issues with the
cramping
still there kind of alleviated by uh
not completely locking out my quads at
the top of all these movements
uh got a great quad pump
went pretty close to failure but not two
failure
that was the intent pretty much that was
the last heavy hard
leg workout of prep next week get some
lighter
legs much higher reps very far from
failure
during uh depletion phase
and then that's it stage time
[Music]
