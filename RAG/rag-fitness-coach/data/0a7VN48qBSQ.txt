oh yes
it's gonna be a hard lockout man up and
back up and back go go go go I'm feeling
weak just from dinosaur yeah makes sense
it's okay it's not like chest
[Music]
yo what up Dr Mike here foreignization
Jared feather ifb Pro super coach
Tristan Lee mega soccer player Mega
influencer
dare I say tick-tocker
because that was offensive that's my
apologies I have been coaching Tristan
here for about two months now it's been
really fun uh he's eating all kinds of
carbohydrates and he's training very
very hard so today we're putting Tristan
through a push session
um we're going to be utilizing the RP
hypertree app it's going to be a good
time you're gonna see all kinds of cool
screenshots cool little features that we
might add in there where we have to
change out exercises since we're in a
new gym but it'll be good to go since
this coach is literally here guiding him
through
yeah
like a bird that goes biggest bird oh
let's get to the workout more power you
need to I don't know if you like
you know what I mean yeah you go jump
exactly how would you do some uh crab
walks yeah soccer warm-ups yeah high
knees some push-ups that's what's up
wow
[Music]
oh
[Music]
all right exercise number one is the low
incline dumbbell fly the elbow angle
here is something you choose that feels
comfortable too straight is going to be
weird on your elbows two bent is just
going to be kind of more of a press than
a fly 135 degrees is a real good start
but play around with it what you want to
make sure is that the degree of Bend is
as stable as possible the whole range of
motion you don't want to do a situation
where you lower the bend at the bottom
you'll notice that sometimes Tristan
during this exercise will start to lower
the bend but then he knows not to do
that so he'll straighten it out a little
bit those micro Corrections can be very
very important
as you go down you want to go super deep
retracting your shoulder blades back to
expand the chest and you want your chest
to stay super up so as you're taking
your wrists and lowering them as deep as
you can you're also lifting your chest
as high into the sky as you can very
slow at the bottom this is not an
exercise I want to use a ton of weight
Evo never any fast transitions out go
down nice and slow pause
and then accelerate out of the bottom
slowly let's get it done
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
yes good I was like pushing his chest to
the ceiling as he goes down creating a
much larger range of motion and
structural effects
let's go
[Music]
oh yes
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
it's okay if you only get nine
[Music]
come on come on
that's good
[Music]
so next exercise was technically a Smith
machine High incline bench
we are doing same high incline but just
with a barbell uh this is a fine way to
swap out exercises and if you're going
to do that on the app basically what
you're going to do is exactly what we're
doing today we're going to work up to a
weight that was similar as you guys know
most Smith machines are a bit easier you
can use a bit more load and we usually
count the Smith machine Implement as 45
pounds anyway just the barbell so we're
going to work up to a load that feels
similar to the 165 that he used last
week he's going to try to either rep
match with probably 155 is my best bet
that's about usually my shift is about a
10 to 20 pound shift depending on the
Smith machine to the barbell so likely
to work up to 155 maybe a little lighter
depending on how he feels and we will
try to uh beat reps I believe there's
probably an added set in there as well
so this is still accumulating volume the
way you would want so that's how you'd
swap it out on the app if you don't have
access to something you had access to in
a previous microcycle or weakness
all right let's go
[Music]
pause down there
yes
eight I guess that Smith machine is
lighter oh hell yeah this is weird no I
mean then even though we thought yeah
and the instability too big factor Andy
just trained chest two days ago
the camera doesn't know that maybe now I
feel like weak just from being sore yeah
makes sense it's okay it's not like
chess is my weak point
thank you
so what Tristan is doing right now is
he's taking the two sets that were still
on this exercise skipping the weights or
getting rid of those two sets that were
at 150 and adding two down sets instead
to keep him in the reference that we're
trying to keep them in so instead of
just decreasing performance like he got
eight on the first set then he might get
six then you might get four we're gonna
take those two sets remove them hit the
add down set feature go to 135 and try
to keep them in that 10 plus rep range
oh
sure
cool one more
[Music]
back back back
so I used to normal benches where I got
like
slide my way all the way up
[Music]
yep beautiful way to push it back one
more
control hello
all right excellent
Max exercise JM press style skull
crusher but with a Twist The Twist is a
physical twist
superset
it's a deficit push-ups oh my God ouch
This is Gonna Hurt Tristan is gonna grab
the ultra comfy handles here with an
open Palm grip and he is going to go
down to his neck slash face area
probably closer to the neck and see if
he can't get his neck close to touching
this why are we doing this because
tension imposed with a deep stretch more
muscle growth promoting than tension
imposed in other ranges of motion and
this level of depth is going to be well
cataclysmic in nature
tragedy or Triumph tune in next for
deficit skull crusher Jam press
ing yes
beautiful man keep it up
oh yes multi left is The Eccentric
really use that stretch use the fuck out
of good stuff now one more
let's get it elbows
big trucks big trucks use it
go yes damn you yes press
[Music]
look forward not down
stomach and butt up pause at the bottom
there you go drive bomb yep
up and back
[Music]
oh shit more
[Music]
yep
forward up and back the butt up
good Tristan press
[Music]
come on good one more Tristan slope on
the way down milk everything don't
modify your Technique to get this
foot up and back
it's gonna be a hard lockout man up and
back up and back go go oh God go go yes
Mike's saying every tip that we give you
is gonna make you harder
that's the motivation I needed on three
tips so far all right folks Tristan is
done with all those pushing exercises
now he's got to do adult exercise we are
doing some free motion y raises here but
we're gonna do them reverse you can do
them one way or the other you can do
them straight on where you can turn and
do them reverse if you have to set it up
just grab both of them like normal and
then step over both with the leg turn
around and get going the reverse ones
are probably objectively a little
Superior they're both good from A
variation perspective what you'll notice
is Vector wise there's basically no
Force up here but down here the force
magnifies as the stretch is produced so
you have the highest degree of tension
with the stretch very rare shoulder
exercise in which we can actually get a
decent stretch on that lateral head and
then coming all the way up you're gonna
know exactly when to stop because up
here it's going to be like oh I could
just hold this forever and then make
sure to slowly control that eccentric
give it a second at the bottom and then
come up in an athletic way tough
exercise make sure that you've got Versa
grips or straps or chalk or something
you don't want grip holding you back on
this if you Institute some kind of grip
fix where the chalk straps or verses you
get five or six more reps per set that
means your rir was whatever you thought
it was plus five or six not very
hypertrophic so make sure your grip is
sorted do your best job these are a
great exercise if you have a free motion
machine if you don't you can do them on
regular cables but the Free Motion One
allows you a lot of options in any case
let's get it done
oh yeah
come on
[Music]
last one let's get it
come on go go slow
oh
okay
last exercise here for Tristan is the
free motion curl these are best done not
facing the machine facing is a fine
option if you face away from the machine
most of the tension is imposed in a deep
stretch just excellent for muscle growth
another thing is this if you're really
close to the machine and the the handles
are here it's really just like a normal
curl you want to walk a few steps
forward so you really stretch back here
come up to here you don't have to come
all the way up to here there's not much
utility there so here you just come up
here control Big Stretch at the bottom
and come back up these are great for my
rep matching they're great for my reps
because all you do is back up you can
even let go of the handles but if not
you just drop your knees a little bit
drop into this position unload the
handles
wait five or six seconds come back up
crank out more reps
[Music]
four three
two one go
oh
beautiful
[Music]
Kristen how'd that work out for you
great but as great as a workout can feel
you guys
