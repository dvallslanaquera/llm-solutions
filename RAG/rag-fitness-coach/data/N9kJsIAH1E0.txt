yes that's totally fine
that was very good
very good and she slides her useless
legs
lieutenant dan style
[Music]
ashley
svendbee spend by if you're whitewashing
it apparently
um
almost pure norwegian heritage isn't
that fun and she's a weightlifter and a
damn good one too but she made a big
mistake she showed up to do a
hypertrophy quad and glute workout today
with jared and i
and the lifters call it bodybuilding
work bodybuilding work
yes yeah
and today we will be building the body
but as you all know already in order to
build the body we must first a tear the
body down
how are you feeling
i feel like my friends are correct they
told me i was going to get rabbits
rhabdo is
possible but unlikely
however certainly there will be pain
ahead are you into pain would you like
to press pause or the x button on your
screen no you don't you want to continue
on and watch ashley get
exploded into millions of pieces that
will reassemble into a bigger newer
stronger ashley that shoots fireballs
and she will take over the world if
you're still watching this video she's
just being nice and giving you time to
enjoy your life before annihilation
let's get into it
you only have three things to do
squats
deficit sumo deadlifts for glutes
and then a lunge to squat superset of
course to just finish the whole thing
off
so squats first we're gonna be doing oh
sets of
five to ten ten to fifteen reps we'll
see where the best sfr is for ashley uh
probably ug was three to five sets
and uh of course for rom probably a
pause at the bottom she says she's a
weightlifter so that technique that'll
be damn good uh
do a couple and then i'll start
critiquing you probably and when you
when you break past parallel still
control the way you're controlling it on
the way down it looks really good but
you're kind of speeding it up at the
bottom there
better
kind of yeah
really open those hips at the bottom and
try to get deep
there you go good so jared and i will
tell you
one of several things
we will give you a little mini technique
corrections mindset
we will also tell you to do more apps or
we'll tell you to rack
until we tell you track or unless you
feel unsafe don't rock
if you feel unsafe or something feels
weird just rack cool pause still pause
pause rep
like always
pauses today pauses tomorrow
standing on a tank over a battlefield
pauses as far as the eye can see
eight good stuff keep going
full boss keeping the quads big chest
big chest big chest nine right here with
you keep it going don't let the ass
shoot up first keep the quads you know
how to squat stop let's go yes more
pressure forward
eleven keep going we're here to work
watch the vagus just a little bit
watch it
[Music]
we're not waiting around forever
yeah there you go up go go go go go go
one more one last one you're good right
away control slow
rack good job wow
not too bad
not too bad at all take a little break
actually the next one you're gonna get
about five less than what you just did
don't let your don't even use the ship
they swim a lot yeah
these are weak
no you're good at a pool but this is
where you make them stronger so if
you're ingraining bad technique you're
just going to keep doing it you know
what i mean so whenever you feel that
like i know i want to do it too because
it shifts when you do this you're
shifting all the pressure into like the
hamstrings glutes that's why you do
because you're getting assisting
musculature involved yeah you want to
keep it in the quads to get your quad
stronger and keep it in the quads and
when you feel this just start shifting
you're going to shake a little bit
because you're not used to it we'll meet
mike right next to you so we'll pick it
up it's all good
oh beautiful it's going to be a lot
harder i don't care if you get five as
long as they're perfect
[Music]
drinking those quads
there it is yes
two good stuff
every rep just like this
might get ready it'll be
open open open beautiful that's how you
keep it in the quads good stuff
i made a controller quad squad squat
there it is
one more
you got it come on
chest at the bottom we're right here
you're good
to chest quads
quad
go ahead and rack
those are the two things when you don't
valgus your ass shoots up first when
your ass shoots up first you cannot
validate so it's like those are two
things weightlifters always have to work
on
uh-huh it's tough
oh i believe it's called a teeter-totter
yeah 135 try to get yeah try to get like
10 15. sure
[Music]
oh you got more
big chests come on
go on that should shoot it first
quack yes more three more
nice pause
quads quads one come on keep moving you
got two more you got it we're right here
go go one last one control good
technique practice good technique keep
them open big chest
one more all day all day let's go watch
watch watch
one more another one let's go too strong
for your own good come on stop
stand up
one more let's go practice good
technique here
there's some warrior
 going on
slow
come on up
rack
good stuff
my feet are i get that on leg presses
for high reps it's like i've been
pressing through my feet for too long
good stuff great stuff
shoes off you can just stay in socks or
flats and we're over there
did squats that was really good
now it's time for something with glute
emphasis
deficit sumo deadlift sumo position
activates the glutes more as
uh indicated by lots of emg studies
a few other few other biomechanical
insights
also if you do it box upper glutes
and then we are going to have a deficit
which means 25 is the biggest plate we
use and ashley's gonna be standing on
plates as well so a nice deep stretch is
always a good thing sets of five to ten
here these are brutal the key is to keep
your back nice and flat don't let it
round over
and to push your knees out as you go
down and to keep the weight always
controlled no touch and go gentle pause
every single time let's get it done
hips open use the glutes oh yes now sit
down into the hips close to the bar
hips open perfect
just like that two
really wide hips
[Music]
three
big chest set
yep
four
try to use those glutes
don't let the hips come up first
oh way to milk that scratch let's go
good stuff
good
five good hits under you
let's get eight
forward chest up
six don't worry about the number
worry about the technique
chest stop sit sit sit
four close push those hips forward
and open oh yes
let's do it let's do it let's do it
let's get serious reset
[Music]
two more reps
go go go
forward into the bar into the bar
yes
slow
hips close hips forward four big chest
hips in chest up
that's it that's it good good good relax
take a break good stuff
feel you feel yourself using the glutes
a little more this way
good stuff
i made all that up
i made it all up
just down the spot i have no idea how to
use the glues
clearly
yeah
genetics
all genetics
one more set of this
your glutes feel okay
a little uh
do they feel kind of crampy already not
crampy but uh pretty
there you go hips forward
beautiful
oh yeah good stuff
hips open
the whole time
[Music]
push them open use the glutes push them
open and use the hips forward there you
go much better
[Music]
up
one last one left just one more sit into
this perfectly sit sit sit sit sit sit
hips open
pressure forward glutes come on yeah so
now you're gonna do
nice and slow nice and slow sit down sit
down sit down
that's it
good stuff put your weights away
otherwise random jack people will do it
for you
and about it
[Music]
it's already scary
oh my god
it's the psychological workflow so
when you turn around
great technique
try not to push off the back leg as much
while keeping the chest up
so front leg try to use it the most
there you go
front leg front leg
big chest
a little less pressure off the back a
little less pressure off the back
basically like a bulgarian the front leg
is doing most of the work last exercise
of the day
lunge to squat superset
jarrod feather is going to be
given all kinds of good cues for getting
the glutes going on lunges it's also
going to hit the quads a lot the
superset after the glutes are fried and
the quads are fried lunges
ash is going to go straight into squats
no rest
messes everything up all really good
stuff high reps here sets of oh 10 to
20. and well on the squats that's a 5 to
10. the lunge just sits at 10 to 20. and
just two sets because she just tapered
into a weightlifting meet her volume
tolerance is
very low and otherwise she would die so
ouch time
touch the knee gently you got this keep
going
[Music]
oh that's it
[Music]
good
go go go go nobody's waiting make it
hard make it hard make it hard
slow
that was too hard of a touch gentle
touch of the knee gentle gentle gently
two more go two more gentle touch front
leg up
gentle gentle up and put the weights
down right into the rack go go go go go
it's gonna feel interesting slow and
controlled full pauses just like last
time everything just like last time goes
out goes out
up
good one
pause up
two again
up
three these are beautiful keep going
[Music]
up
good minimal rest the top go go go we're
not waiting around
up
down
up
rack
good stuff
take a break very good just one of these
left and that's it
you sure two is a good idea
yeah
she's a strong gal
she's norwegian it will be just fine
we're gonna get a hospital bill
that was okay slower
we're being honest here good the dying
is the point
through dying we find new life
slow
slow
up turn and do five more
and then come back and do squats go
slow
not like one really hard slow
two chest stop slow
three two more come on you gotta go slow
slow last one got to be good or i won't
count
