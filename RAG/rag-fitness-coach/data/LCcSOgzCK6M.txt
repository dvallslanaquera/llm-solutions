welcome back to the fourth
episode in the series uh it's been a
while so
i had one deload week during which i was
traveling around
and had some stuff to take care of um
and then i had
i believe it's been
a week almost a week since i was first
released this episode
um but it's been quite busy with
coaching work
i've got a lot of new clients which i've
all set up now so hopefully
things should calm down again but i've
got a lot of new clients um
a lot of things are being planned out
for the future so it's just a bit busy
um yeah to get you up to speed with
what's been going on in my training
this is a start of a massing phase i
just finished up my
cut phase for i believe ten weeks or
eight weeks eight weeks i think
uh during which i lost around seven
kilograms uh if you want to see
what that looked like there's an
instagram post
in well on instagram where you can see
how much weight i lost and how that sort
of difference looked
um but yeah long story short i lost
around seven
kilograms i believe and i look a lot
leaner now than it back then
so i think i mostly retain muscle mass
pretty well
um but yeah since i'm now 18
well when i was recording this stuff i
was 18 weeks out
my show is on the 31st of october um
i still have quite a long time until
then and so i'll be massing for the next
six weeks essentially so until i'm i
believe
around 12 weeks out i'll be massing for
five six weeks and then i'll be
um maintaining for a couple weeks and
then i'll be cutting
into my show essentially um
yeah for this matching phase the
emphasis is going to be on growing
my chest norms after talking to a lot of
people
um including people who are into
bodybuilding
uh i'm just sort of just general
population as well and myself um i came
to the conclusion that by and large
my chest and arms are the weakest body
parts i have um
i think generally my quads hamstrings
glutes are pretty strong my back is
fairly strong
my shoulders are pretty good as well but
then chest and arms and maybe calves but
calves don't contribute that much to
good physique um
so for now it's mostly just specializing
on just norms
um so yeah that's how i determined what
body parts specialize on
i think one mistake people sometimes
make is trying to specialize on
certain body parts while cutting
just briefly um specializing on certain
body parts while cutting doesn't
typically work out very well
because cutting isn't really an ideal
time to be growing muscle mass in the
first
place being in a deficit doesn't make it
easier to grow muscle mass
for a few reasons one is recovery's
worse so you can do less volume
a second one is just losing weight
typically unless you lift weights and
need high protein etc
some of that weight loss is going to
come from muscle and so building muscle
uh instead of losing muscle in the
deficit is difficult it's the same
reason why being a surplus
makes it easier to gain muscle mass
because even if you're not lifting
weights you're not really that much
protein
and your sleep is terrible some fraction
of your weight gain
is still going to be muscle mass and so
trying to grow certain body parts
certain weaker body parts or lagging
body parts
in a deficit is difficult to say least
um and so if your goal is bringing up
certain body parts
that's almost always best done in a
surplus
um yeah the reason i'm masking now is
because
i'm still about 18 weeks out from my
show
but realistically i don't think i need
18 weeks to get into
show condition show condition but the
intention now is very much to get
very lean by the time the show comes
around
i know something people talk about with
regards to
people competing for the first time is
that they can't get quite as lean as
more seasoned competitors um
i think i can sort of understand where
that's coming from on principle because
people who've been competing for a
longer time
have better habits as far as eating
habits
being physically active sort of habits
and thus it makes it easier for them to
get into shape and to get leaner than
most people ever could
um but i think at the same time just
because it holds true on principle or an
average
doesn't mean it's going to hold true for
every single individual and so i think
in my case
i don't see a very good reason why i
couldn't um
get very very lean so yeah we'll see i'm
pretty confident regarding
my ability to get lean especially
because now so
one of the things that's been going on
lately that's meant a slower release
schedule for videos uh coaching as well
and that sort of thing
has been i've been coming off medication
so
i've briefly mentioned this on instagram
but i used to be
on a medication called
myrtozepine i think brand name or like
i think brand name is remyron um i was
on 15 milligrams
for four years it's primarily used
as an antidepressant so for treating
depression
um but in my case i was
largely using that specific substance
sorry
because i also had insomnia and i found
that
because it has a pretty strong acute
sedation effect
so it makes you sleepy i found it quite
useful in
dealing with my insomnia and so for
almost four years now since september or
october 2017
i took which is being every night
and it did have a few side effects one
of which
is very relevant right now which was
increased hunger
i think that side effects served me
pretty well
over these last four years because it
allowed me to gain weight fairly easily
um which i think used to be something i
struggled with
prior to going on medication but now it
certainly wasn't an issue
um but yeah i've been
for a few reasons i came off much zopine
called turkey so just one day to the
next
um i'd previously obviously none of this
is medical advice so don't take any of
this to mean
you should do anything a certain way
always consult your own gp
or your own physician before doing
anything but in my case
after consulting a gp we sort of came to
the conclusion that
coming off cold tacky made some sense
these next five weeks shouldn't be too
stressful as far as any deadlines go
uh the training isn't particularly hard
because
well i'm specializing in chest norms and
so even if i'm
a bit sleepy deprived or feel a bit
rough it's not a huge deal because i'm
not trading
you know i'm not trading super hard or
feeling like super hard
um and so i can afford to have some
sleep deprivation
and then another reason was also i came
off my discipline
basically entirely last year while
tapered by tapering off of it
by taking um
one day less each week so
initially i was taking it every day then
i took it six days a week then five days
a week and so forth until i hit uh one
day a week
and once i had fully tapered off i sort
of realized um
i preferred taking it for a time being
because i was finishing up my undergrad
in sports science and it was a pretty
high stress period and so coming off of
it
and risking having less sleep during
that time just wasn't something that was
helpful but then now
life's fairly relaxed and i think i can
afford
to deal with some sleep deprivation and
most importantly i've learned a lot of
helpful habits to
manage my insomnia pretty well and to
sort of lifestyle changes like being
physically active
training pretty often and those sorts of
things
um yeah and
the final reason why i wanted to come
off now was
as i said it gives me some
an increase in appetite and so coming
off it now
right before my prep or at least a hard
part of my prep begins
is going to allow me to have an easier
time dealing with hunger
so i've been off of medication for
i believe around 10 or 11 days now and
i've got to say
i have not been hungry at all it's been
very difficult to mass
i i've been able to gain some weight i
think
but it's been markedly more difficult
than before and so i suspect coming off
medication is going to make it
a lot easier for me to successfully
achieve my contest prep
um yeah and i'm looking forward to it
i it feels like i would find it easier
to cut right now than to mass
and that's after a 10 week cut and
that's a very good sign
um that's part of the reason i'm
confident that i can
accomplish practice contest prep
successfully this time around
but yeah that's essentially what's been
going on these past few weeks um
i also passed my driving test which was
very exciting and i'm getting a car
so it's been a lot of non-lifting
related stuff going on that's made um
making youtube videos less of a priority
but now i should be back
and i plan on making one of these every
week now
the videos might not come out on time
so like this your the training you're
seeing right now for example is from
a week and a half ago um but i'll try
and get everything out just so you get a
sort of rough idea of how my trading is
progressing during prep and how
everything's looking
but yeah now i wanted to talk about
when or why specialize on certain body
parts
typically i think people
want to specialize on certain body parts
a bit too early in their training career
and i don't think there's anything wrong
with that in most situations
like for example if i have someone
if i'm a client from the gen pop so
general population
who is looking mostly to just get a good
physique by most people's standards
like i said he's a dude in his 30s
um who doesn't really care about
palliating or bodybuilding at all
mostly just wants to look good overall
in that case
it doesn't necessarily make sense to
specialize but it certainly can make
sense to put a bit more emphasis on
certain muscle groups
so for a guy for example who just wants
to look good by look good by his
standards
that typically means doing most of his
upper body work first in the sessions
if he's training upper body and lower
body together typically means
mostly focusing on chest arms and delts
and some back
um and or if they have concerns with
midsection appearance some abs as well
um so yeah i think
for a lot of people who have ambitions
of going further in bodybuilding or
palleting
it can make sense to delay specializing
a bit
because realistically in the first years
of training you're gonna see gains
all over your body anyways and so
specializing can be a bit premature
and it can also make you specialize on
body parts that don't need it
because you have after a few years of
training
it's easier to tell which of your body
parts are genetically predisposed to
being
big compared to other body parts so in
my case for example
i hit a 200 kilogram deadlift when i was
17.
um so that's 440 pounds
but my best bench was like 200 pounds
and so yeah it was after a few years of
training i started training when i was
14
15 and now i'm 21 but after a few years
of training i could sort of begin to see
okay it seems like my
legs respond pretty well to training in
general at least my quads adductors and
hamstrings
and glutes but then my arms and chest
might respond a little bit less
well i also initially thought my
shoulders responded pretty poorly
but then as i actually spent a few more
years just sort of training everything
equally
i discovered it actually um
it was more so just a matter of
improving my training overall
range of motion uh frequency
just general programming stuff um and
that led to my shoulders growing a lot
more
and so i think until you've spent quite
a few years training
and optimizing things it can be too
early to tell
which body parts need work for you to
reach your
peak natural physique or peak enhanced
physique or what have you
i think taking a few years to develop
your physique overall can give you an
idea of
where you're genetically blessed or
cursed um
so that's why i waited until basically
now
until now i specialized on body parts
maybe for a few months total but in my
first five years of training or so
45 years of training i basically didn't
specialize at all i just trained
everything pretty equally using mostly
compound exercises
um and yeah it's helping pretty well i
think it built a decent base overall
i think in the first years of training
people are going to see the most results
and most of those results come from
just eating sufficient protein uh eating
efficient calories so
typically that means um enough to gain
weight
if most people have a lower body fat
when starting out
um lifting pretty hard
mostly in the 5 to 30 rep range
and if you repeat that for a few years
and you keep gaining weight and keep an
eye on
performance and make sure the numbers
are going up week to week or month to
month
typically that means you're going to
build a decent physique um
especially if you use mostly compound
exercises that train muscle groups well
multiple muscles at once so yeah
after a few years of training you can
then make that decision to specialize
um but again that decision should be
very complex dependent
if you're someone who doesn't really
care about bodybuilding or palliating
and you just want to look good then you
can certainly place an emphasis on
certain body parts earlier in your
career
but then in my example um i'm still not
sure how
seriously i'll take bodybuilding and
palliating because i haven't
competed in either that much i've
competed in palpatine once and i'm about
to do my first show
but once i've done both um i'll have a
better idea of how
how seriously i plan on competing at
both and
how how much those sports should
impact my decision making and then from
that i can make
more informed decisions regarding when
and on what to specialize
but for now for bodybuilding and kind of
palliating but not really
um it makes sense specialize on my arms
and chest
also i think one good thing about
specialized premiere now is that chest
and arms
are two of the easiest body parts to
train um
they're just very nice easy
simple after years and years of training
lower body hard
and getting stronger and stronger
specializing on chest and arms comes as
a real sort of
welcome break so i can't complain
um i realize it's probably gonna take me
a few years
until my chest and arms really catch up
to the rest i expect um
but yeah i'm not too unhappy with how
things are now
and i recently made a post on my
instagram
transformation post from
age 17 to 21 and
yeah during that time i didn't
specialize on chest and arms
much if at all maybe if you're a few
months total
yet compared to the rest of my physique
i think my chest and arms probably came
the longest way um
i think that was mostly just because
initially i wasn't treating my chest and
arms very well
they were into focus and then as my
training programming understanding of
sports science as a whole improved
i was able to make more progress there
um
but yeah that's how this current mass
space is going i am enjoying it
and i'm looking forward to the rest of
it and then
i think that's mostly as far as my own
training goes and sort of
overarching themes i'm currently eating
because i know people sometimes ask
about nutrition i'm currently eating
around 5 500 calories on trading days
which is a lot
and then around like 2 500 on
non-training days
which averages out to around i think i
want to say like
4 500 calories per day which is a lot
but i'm
almost 220 pounds and i'm quite
physically active
so yeah it's it's been nice but it's
also been a bit difficult to get the
food in at times
anyways i'm not going to comment on the
actual trainings going on um
this was some wrist curls i
i've been doing two different exercises
for risks
for forms i guess uh forearms are also
being specialized on so it's bicep
tricep
forms and chest
the reason i'm including two form
exercises in spite of the forms being
so simple to train quote unquote is
because
since i'm doing a lot of volume performs
and i want to avoid overuse injuries
and i also want to make sure i get as
much development as possible
it makes sense to include at least two
exercises
one reason for that is it allows me to
hit certain fibers
more or less like for example i'm doing
dumbbell wrist curls and
barbell wrist curls in this video um
they might hit slightly different areas
of the forearms slightly differently and
thus combining both exercises can allow
you to get a bit more growth overall
and there's some evidence in support of
that where
they compare doing only one exercise to
doing several exercises with the same
volume same
going to failure etc um and it seems
like using
several exercises for a body part does
lead to more muscle growth overall
then the second reason is typically a
bit more exercise variation
likely does reduce overuse injury risk
so if you always do the exact same
exercise like on a
let's make a an absurd hypothetical
scenario to illustrate my point
let's say all you ever trained was
upright rows like i'm doing here
like every session you just come in do
20 sets of upper rows leave and repeat
that's always the same structures the
same muscle groups being stressed
um it's going to be more difficult for
them to recover
and so let's say you switch to doing 10
sets of up arrows and tends to ladder
raises
just that small change already is going
to stress your
shoulder joint your lateral belts your
bicep etc
slightly differently and thus might
result in a slight reduction in overuse
injury risk
obviously that's not going to hold true
to the same extent when i'm talking
about
forearm training and adding in one
exercise but i think you can see what i
mean when i say that
using different exercises can allow you
to reduce overuse injury risk
um so yeah right now front delts aren't
a priority
so i'm doing them once a week because of
how involved they are
in chest work and to an extent maybe
even upright woodwork and
that sort of thing and try spock as well
they
probably don't need a ton of volume from
overhead pressing
or front raises to grow um
so yeah i'm not really training that
much i guess one thing i should clarify
regarding specializing
is
there are a few considerations when
you're determining how many muscle
groups you specialize on
one is how long you've been training for
and what your systemic mrd is
typically the higher your systemic mrv
so how much volume you can recover from
overall
including body training for all body
parts
the more body parts you can specialize
on at once so for example let's say you
can recover from
300 sets a week um if you can recover
from that many stats
overall then you can probably specialize
on more body parts before running into
any systemic recovery issues
so you might be able to specialize on
most body parts while only
training a few with less volume but then
in my case for example
i've been training for a while my
systemic mrv isn't that high
i probably can't specialize on that many
boy puts at once
so i'm specializing on chest and arms at
the moment which is around four to five
muscle groups
so four actually not bad um
a second consideration is how much
you're training
other muscle groups that aren't being
specialized on so
they're by and large two options i think
that are worth considering when
specializing the first option is
training them at maintenance volumes
so just enough to maintain and the
second option is training at minimum
effective volumes
if you're doing the former you can
specialize on more body parts at once
because you have more of a stomach
mrv gap to be filled whereas if you're
training them at mev
then you have less of a gap to fill and
so in that case you can only specialize
on
fewer body parts so yeah consider
both training age stomach mrv
and with how much volume you're training
your other body parts
when considering how many body parts you
want to specialize on anyways that's it
