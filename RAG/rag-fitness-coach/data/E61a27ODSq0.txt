what determines whether a muscle or
muscle region is recruited during an
exercise
as detailed previously at the house of
hypertrophy neuromechanical matching may
be the primary answer that is the
nervous system recruits muscle or muscle
regions that have the greatest leverage
for that exercise
think of leverage as how easily a muscle
or muscle region can produce force for a
given exercise
now
chances are you're human and humans have
many similarities
in many situations
the leverage a specific muscle or muscle
region has for an exercise is going to
be similar among numerous individuals
for example the middle deltoid has the
greatest leverage for shoulder abduction
versus other muscles a finding
consistent among numerous studies
so a shoulder abduction exercise like
lateral raises is going to
preferentially grow the middle deltoid
in virtually all individuals
yet in other cases individual
differences certainly exist in the
leverage a muscle or muscle region has
for an exercise
in this video we'll explore the evidence
for this what this means for your
training and we'll wrap up trying to
answer whether an individual can change
what muscle region they predominantly
recruit during an exercise
let's dive in
[Music]
a 2021 study out of france had trained
subjects before nordic curls and
stiff-legged deadlifts
while activation of three hamstring
muscles semitendinosus semimembranosus
and biceps femoris was recorded via
surface electromyography
for both exercises hamstring activation
was not identical between individuals
for example with the nordic curl quite a
few individuals saw the highest
activation in the biceps femoris but for
others it was the semitendinosus or
semimembranosus
likewise for the stiff-legged deadlift
some recruited the semimembranosus the
most others the biceps femoris
another 2020 study out of poland found
during a barbell bench press the
activation of the chest triceps and
anterior deltoid differed between
individuals some tended to activate the
chest the most others the triceps the
most and even others the anterior
deltoid the most
other research also finds during tasks
such as walking and cycling muscle
activation patterns differ between
individuals
now all of these research papers use
surface electromyography abbreviated to
emg which has limitations
it does not precisely measure muscle
activation
rather it estimates the strength of the
nerve signals to muscle fibers a few
steps before actual muscle activation
moreover many technical points exist
where surface electromyography research
can go wrong
even so i still believe the mentioned
studies are useful
for one the french study had excellent
reliability as they retested the
measures in another session with similar
recordings attained
secondly the polish study did involve
electromyography recordings from maximal
isometric bench press contractions with
their elbows at 90 degrees
something that might be better for
increasing the validity of the
recordings
so all in all i believe we have
promising data indicated in certain
situations
not everyone experiences the same muscle
recruitment patterns during an exercise
this means just because one individual
says their muscles grew a certain way
with one or a selection of exercises it
does not necessarily mean you'll
experience the same thing
over the long term you're going to want
to try and figure out what selection of
exercises work best for your body and
goals
this is why tracking your training and
running your own small experiments can
be of great benefit
i've noted two example situations in the
pins comment for those interested
besides
not everyone's anatomy and preferences
are the same either
certain exercises may suit someone's
anatomy and or preferences more than
someone else and this may indeed matter
for long-term muscle growth for example
a 2017 study out of the usa recruited 17
men with an average of 5.6 years of
training experience
subjects were assigned to a fixed or
autoregulated group
the fixed group was given this program
to train weekly
the auto-regulated group was free to
select what exercises they wanted to
train per muscle group each session from
a wide list
all other training variables were the
same between groups
by the end of the 9 week study duration
lean body mass gains were greater for
the autoregulated group
presumably at least some of this result
is due to trained individuals having a
good understanding of what exercises
work best for them leading to better
muscle adaptations
during compound exercises that recruit
multiple muscle groups
logical evidence suggests your technique
biases towards recruiting your stronger
muscle or muscle groups
for example this 2009 study out of the
usa established people with greater back
strength relative to knee strength used
their back more during a lifting task
while people with greater knee strength
relative to back strength used a more
knee dominant strategy
this could work against your goals
say you want the barbell bench press to
highly develop your chest yet perhaps
you use a deltoid dominant technique
unknowingly
you may lower the bar as usual but you
press up and then back resulting in a
large part of the lifting phase being
far from the line of your shoulders
something that likely recruits the
anterior deltoid more a better way would
be to lower as usual and then instantly
press backwards to reduce the distance
between the bar and the shoulder line
and then upwards when necessary
this technique is likely more favorable
for chest development and in fact elite
bench presses tend to use this bar path
no
this precise bar path is executed easier
during hard repetitions where the bar is
moving slowly because you're nearing
failure or you're using heavy weights
with easier repetitions simply aiming to
press backwards straight off the chest
will suffice
the takeaway here is it's good to be
aware of the technique you're using
during a compound exercise is it
conducive to your goals
this is one reason why recording
yourself performing an exercise can be
useful
[Music]
we've just mentioned how you want to be
aware of your technique during compound
exercises as this can influence which
muscle groups you preferentially recruit
but
away from technique
is there any way to change which muscle
groups get preferentially recruited
some new research suggests there might
be
specifically performing additional
isolated training for a muscle group may
subsequently increase its activation
during a compound exercise
we previously noted a study from poland
indicating recruitment of the chest
triceps and anterior deltoids differ
between individuals on the barbell bench
press
but the researchers did something
interesting
they split subjects into one of three
groups
those with the lowest chest emg
recordings during the bench press the
chest group
those with the lowest anterior deltoid
emg recordings the anterior deltoid
group and those with the lowest triceps
emg recordings the triceps group
the subjects went on to perform a
targeted isolation training for their
respective lowest emg muscle
performing three exercises per session
each for four sets of 10 to 15
repetitions to failure three times per
week for six weeks
these were the exercises used for each
group per session
all three groups also perform three sets
with a full rep max load on the barbell
bench press each week to ensure strength
did not attenuate
after the six-week training period
recruitment of the chest anterior
deltoid and triceps were remeasured and
all three groups increased the
recruitment of the muscle they trained
the anterior deltoid group recruited the
anterior deltoid more with a slightly
non-significant decrease in triceps and
chest involvement
the chest group recruited the chest more
with a sharp decrease in anterior
deltoid involvement but little triceps
recruitment change
the triceps group recruited the triceps
more with a decrease in chest and
anterior deltoid involvement
another study out of the usa recorded
gluteus maximus involvement during
bilateral and unilateral squads before
and after a week of daily glute band
training
glute involvement during the bilateral
and unilateral squats was increased
after the week of daily glute band
training
thus the literature suggests performing
isolated training for a muscle group and
reducing or ceasing training for other
muscle groups may lead to the trained
muscle group increasing its involvement
in a compound exercise
more research is still needed to
establish the true effectiveness of this
method but if you would really like to
change what muscle group you
preferentially recruit during a compound
exercise you may wish to experiment with
this concept
perhaps you like the back squat but
you'd like it to recruit the glutes more
than usual performing some added
isolation training for the glutes for a
while while minimizing work for other
muscles may accomplish this
similarly if you like deadlifts but
you'd like it to recruit the glutes or
hamstrings more than the spinal erectors
performing glute or hamstring isolator
training for a while while minimizing
spinal erector training may accomplish
this
[Music]
in summary
individuals do not always recruit the
same muscle or muscle regions during an
exercise
so over the long term you're going to
want to figure out what selection of
exercises works best for you anatomy and
preferences also play a role here
with compound exercises you should be
mindful of whether your technique is
executed in a way that predominantly
recruits the muscle group you want to
maximally train
finally
it's possible performing added isolation
training for a muscle group for a while
will increase that muscle's activation
during a compound exercise
this could be useful if you wish to
change what muscle group you
preferentially recruit during a compound
exercise
