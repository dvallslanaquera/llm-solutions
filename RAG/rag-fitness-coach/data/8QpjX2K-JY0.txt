hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
nutrition myths number 10
losing fat while gaining muscle
oh boy we're going to talk about the
claim why it's wrong
some silver linings as to how it could
be right in some cases and then
best practices moving forward here's the
claim
okay it's kind of a four-part claim
with a fifth clarifying part a little
bit more of a technical myth here
claim number one is you can readily gain
muscle and lose fat at the same time
there are ways in which that is true
we'll get into it a bit
claim number two you can gain tons of
muscle with no fat gain at the same time
much less true we'll get into that in a
little bit number three you don't have
to do distinct muscle gain and fat loss
phases
because you can have it all at the same
time in one phase
and getting in shape gaining muscle and
losing fat
isn't a kind of phasic process where you
gain some muscle but you also gain some
fat take some steps back
and then you lose some fat but you're
not gaining a ton of muscle during that
time so it's not taking steps back but
it's kind of a holding pattern until you
lose the fat and then back in it's not
this phasic process of trade-offs
it's an all into results just a linear
process of just get better better better
better better
lose muscle or lose fat and gain muscle
at the same time it just
just keeps going right that's the claim
a lot of folks would like to believe
this and it is
in most instances for for most people
who are most interested in it more
incorrect than it is correct
okay so this is a bit more of a nuanced
one where it's not like biohacking or
it's just straight up bullshit
this has some stuff to it but that's why
we're making this video to dig into that
stuff
and some important terms that we're
going to be using later and just
important ones for you to be aware of
people say lean gains that means
essentially gaining
mostly or all muscle and no fat and when
they say recomping
that's when you gain muscle and lose fat
at the same time
both of those are sort of the claims
here both of them
have severe limitations okay severe
limitations
so here are the reasons this claim the
series of claims
wrong we don't want to see wrong here
but highly highly lacking
more wrong than right decent analogy
here is if your friend
says to you like dude i'm a winner in
the casino like
that's certainly true some of the time
under some circumstances
but under the average circumstances in
the average time it's not true
it is not a dependable thing to think
you're a winner at a casino
over the long term will lose all of your
money that way just the same way
if you think your best efforts are spent
in recomping or lean gaining and you
never pay attention to intentional
massing or fat loss phases
you're not getting the most bang for
your buck most of the time you're eating
less paying for your buck than you could
be
so you can
notably gain lots of muscle and lose
lots of fat
at the same time in a few circumstances
and here they are
one is you're not used to much or any of
diet or training structure
okay you're a noob or you make your diet
and training structure much more
intelligent and much more efficacious
than it previously was so for example
you used to never
time your carbohydrates around workouts
you start doing that you eat one meal a
day now you start eating five
you used to train and sort of kind of be
hypercaloric
um but you know sometimes your calories
are really off sometimes not
now in a recomp you uh just nail your
calories every single time you're
finally eating enough protein
stuff like that these big changes that
like if you start doing more of them
you absolutely can gain muscle and lose
fat at the same time for sure
right another one is you're coming back
to training and die from a long layoff
like if you've been you know covered
messed you up or something you've been
out of dim for three months six months
you absolutely when you start lifting
weights and eating relatively normally
again
at hell or just start lifting weights
you can gain muscle and lose fat notably
like
seriously a lot of impressive results at
the same time absolutely true
if you're dipping into special sports
supplements either for the first time or
taking more of them than usual you
absolutely can
gain muscle and lose fat at the same
time professional bodybuilders do it all
the time but we're not all special
sports supplements so it doesn't exactly
apply to most people
and here there's a distinction we say
notable gains
there are two terms here notable gains
are like
impressive gains that you can reliably
put a stamp on and say i'm comfortable
getting these this is a good rate
technical gains are what are measured in
studies so a lot of people refer to
studies but say see recomping is real
even in advanced athletes
you look at the magnitude of fat loss
and muscle gain
it's detectable in the study but barely
detectable with fine-tuned scientific
instruments
and a huge sample of people in an
individual
applying that you would barely notice a
thing so you could say look dude i'm
recomping
and then you do six months of recomping
if you're advanced then you've already
been doing all the things right
and you can get a dexa or something and
it says you like lost one percent fat
and gained one percent muscle
were you technically successful yes were
you notably successful well literally no
because nobody can tell
you come back to the gym the next day
after getting your dexterity
fellas you know yeah and they're like
what are you doing like just flexing my
one percent more muscle
should be easy to see with my one
percent less fat and they're like
you're an idiot so yeah you did that for
six months and that's what happened
cool technically you made gains i don't
think you're tuning into this channel to
make technical gains
i think you're tuning in to all these
youtube fitness channels to make notable
gains
that's what you want so when someone
tells you recomping works
they're probably right it does work but
it doesn't work nearly as well in most
cases
as intentional muscle gain phases and
intentional fat loss phases
sequence together okay
so here's the deal other than this
these three things where you're not used
to what your diet training structure if
you're coming back to it after a long
layoff
or you're taking special sports
supplements if you're not in one of
those groups people can
you lose muscle sorry can you lose you
can definitely lose muscle and gain fat
at the same time
can you gain muscle and lose fat at the
same time yes but it's
painfully slow and often very tough to
notice
at all and if you are relatively lean
it becomes almost impossible except for
incredibly rare cases
if your sub 10 fat as a male or sub 18
fat as a female
in order to grow muscle under such
restricted conditions your body has to
burn fat
it's gotta be if you're growing muscle
but you're not gaining weight because
you're recomping you're not in a surplus
growing muscle no weight gain you have
to burn a concomitant amount of fat
for you to have the sheer anabolic drive
to gain muscle
while at the same time having the
catabolic drive to burn
fat and resist the catabolic impetus
of getting that lean because you guys
know the leaner you get the more your
body fights against you
the more difficult it makes fat loss and
the tougher it makes muscle retention
but you're not even trying to retain
muscle here you're trying to gain it
while you're trying to get even leaner
can you imagine someone
being at six percent body fat getting
down to three percent fat
while increasing their muscle three
percent that's insane it just
doesn't happen under almost any under
almost any circumstances
so it's just not reliable so if you're
already lean
recomping is just not a bet at all
okay lean gains maybe but barely
recomping is pretty much out of the
window if you're already lean and
muscular
if you're not lean and muscular yeah it
has a bit more play but it's still
probably not the best option
here's the thing what is the alternative
distinct
muscle gain and fat loss phases are much
better if you do one and then you do the
other
in combination you can get much further
sequencing them
than just trying to do lean gains or
recomping the entire time why
because the most profound thing other
than resistance training and eating
protein
on how much muscle you gain isn't a
hypercaloric condition
if you eat excess calories by just a
little it is unbelievably anabolic
and the most profound fat catabolic
signal
is a caloric deficit if you create a
caloric deficit
then it's the thing that burns fat it's
the most powerful fat burning machine
if you're at maintenance you get to use
zero of them you literally throw away
your two best weapons not a good idea
not a good idea at all you want to use
your best weapons
at first to gain muscle or to lose fat
and then after you switch the script and
do it again
stupid analogy but if you are trying to
speak
english and chinese to a group of
americans into a group of chinese people
none of whom speak the other language
is it a good idea for you to speak in
both languages at the same time
something will be understood but a lot
will be missing why don't you just be
like
hold up chinese people and you speak to
the americans blah blah blah
they're like okay you get it and then
you speak in chinese the chinese people
are like
got it best of both worlds not to be
mixed there's a lot of other things like
that you don't mix
you don't mix spaghetti and cake even
though they're both good there's a
timing there's a sequence element there
it's much better
to do distinct fat loss phases and
distinct muscle gain phases
sequencing them once you get lean you
put upon some muscle and some fat
once you put on some muscle and some fat
you need another fat loss face to get
rid of the fat
boop so on and so forth then you get big
and you get lean that's how pretty much
[Music]
almost every if not every competitive
large bodybuilder has done
that's the most muscular lean people in
the world do exactly and only that
right for good reason because it works
trying
to look for lean gains where you gain
only muscle and no fat
severely severely restricting yourself
in order to do that or recomping
to the moon is a fool's errand because
even if it works
marginally your margins could be higher
if you did it another way
that's like saying to yourself like if i
want to visit my friend
in a city that's 50 miles away i can
take a bicycle because that false
no you can probably ride a bicycle for
50 miles if your normal decent shape
will be
super fucking hard it'll take you
forever and you'll be super tired
afterwards
but you can get there but if you also
have a car
why not take the car and someone could
say well there's got all these other
downsides and for sure it does like you
know it's uncomfortable to gain
a lot of weight and a little bit of fat
sure of course that's the downside but
it's just more effective so if you're
looking for pure effect
the phasic approach is better than
trying to lean gains and trying to do
recomping
all the time however
lean gaining and recomping absolutely
work well for beginners especially
okay and it's often good to just get
beginners and do a pretty healthy diet
and regular weight training because you
don't want to inundate them with a
hypochlorous diet or hypercaloric diet
like it's weird to get a healthy diet
and start stuffing yourself
or healthy diet and get really
restrictive you just want beginners to
start with like a good healthy muscle
building diet plenty of protein plenty
of energy
regular meals and then teach them how to
lift weights and then you just don't
even look at their body weight
right and they normally just either in a
slight surplus light deficit or just on
average just keep
maintenance level intake and then they
build tons of muscle and lose tons of
fat for months and months and months
and then once you
uh you know they don't need to press
these powerful levers
but also they can't to some extent or
less likely to because it takes a lot of
cognitive bandwidth right
like it's tough enough to learn how to
train and make that a habit it's tough
enough to learn how to diet make that
happen
you don't want to push any other pedals
on like force-feeding them
or on dieting them too hard you just
start them out
with the recomposition approach which
for them works powerfully enough to be
very notable
and you can just let them coast
eventually you'll have to take them to
the next best thing
but they do gain excellent result uh
results for months
with without a whole lot of effort which
is awesome especially for the beginners
that can't yet be expected to put out a
crazy amount of effort now
in the same boat if you're coming back
to diet or training
either one or both from a long layoff of
either one or both like for example if
you
have been training but your diet's just
been total shit and you start eating
really well
you can also recomp anderling gain no
problem
and you just have to be aware enough to
realize
when the process of recomping has slowed
and you don't want to try to get into a
situation where you try to
boost your recomping abilities again
people will say like man
i was just eating at maintenance i
cleaned up my diet i was training really
hard
i gained a ton of muscle a ton of
strength lost a bunch of fat in the
first six months
in the last two months it's month eight
now it's really like i can't tell if
i've gained muscle or lost fat i
think i have maybe a little bit
the question to ask then is not okay how
do i like relight the fire of recomp
that's not the question the question to
ask is what should i do next a fat loss
phase or a muscle gain phase
you guys with me on that like that's the
next step for advanced athletes that
need the most
serious form of intervention so
what is the most serious form of
dimension what are these best practices
if you're a beginner to diet under
training just starting and being body
weight stable for months is totally fine
getting into the rhythm of eating
getting into the rhythm of training
you'll get
really amazing results for sure it works
for these folks
and no it's not your fastest fat loss
like look if someone is a hollywood star
and they come to you and they're like
six months to get
shredded for this roll you're not going
to recomp them that's insane you're
going to put them right into a deficit
because they said shredded
you will lose fat faster at a deficit
period there's no way to do it
as fast in maintenance as it is in the
deficit if they said to you
hey i gotta have this role where i have
to be and they're pretty lean to start
they say i have to be much bigger uh and
more muscular like it's okay if i'm not
super lean but i have to be jacked
in six months you're not gonna keep them
at maintenance that's insane like
someone says like hey willem dafoe you
got to be jacked and you keep my
maintenance for six months
like we said jacked he weighs 150 pounds
and he's like six months the hell is
going on
right at least 180 or something you have
to introduce a hyper caloric condition
you have to eat at a surplus
so beginners who start and stay at a
body weight level that's the same at
maintenance
they don't get their best possible
results those would come if they started
the fluctuations but
the bandwidth thing and it's totally
fine it does work really well for them
once you've gone either coming back into
training or dieting
or as a pure beginner of about 6 to 12
months at maintenance calories
usually that's when the results start to
peter out a little bit now you will
still make gains for years
in recomp but there's just going to be
technical gains and not notable gains
they're going to be very very slow and
painful
so once you get there you can begin
either a fat loss phase
or a muscle gain phase based on
whichever you want first
and we're going to have other videos
coming out later about which one you
should pick depending on what
all these other details but the end of
the day it doesn't matter a ton
i'll give you the tldr if you're pretty
over fat
and you don't like how you look because
you have too much body fat
you just need to cut and that's probably
the best thing once
you are relatively lean and you're at
least comfortable like i'm pretty lean
then you can bulk but if you get after
recomping if you're like pretty lean
you could just go right into bulk that's
the short answer
this way by doing the maintenance
recomp first and then once that process
essentially runs its course as far as
having notable yield and switches to
just technical yield
then you go into intentional massing or
cutting or intentional fat loss or
muscle gain phase
and that way you get excellent results
you get the easy gains when you're
prying for them you don't have to
manipulate your diet like crazy stuff
yourself or starve yourself
and you're switching to more effective
intentional
weight gain or loss when you can't get
much out of her comping anymore which is
just intelligent right like
again the question to ask when recomping
doesn't work well for you anymore isn't
what can i do to make recomping work
better it's what can i do
to gain more muscle and lose more fat
because that's what you really want and
the answer there is probably dedicated
phases
and it gives you the easy gains but it
also prevents you from hitting your head
against
the lean gains wall for too long too
many people get
i don't want to say addicted to get the
expectation
that their noob recomp is just something
that's going to keep happening
and they're going to say you know i
started at 170 pounds i started lifting
weights
i got 12 months later i was 170 and i
had like abs and my muscles were popping
out
i just want more of that to keep coming
not a good idea
it won't and if it hasn't there really
are no levers to pull
and now at this point you need to either
lose fat
or gain weight lose fat gain muscle etc
they need to be separate phases
that's how you put your best foot
forward folks thanks for tuning in give
it some thought
let me know what you think in the
comments below have a good one
you
