hey folks dr mike ezratel here for
renaissance periodization
nutrition myths number eight keto
burns more fat boy did we wade into
controversy with this one
let's talk about the claim reasons why
it's wrong some silver lining to it and
then ways to move forward to actually
make sense of the stuff
here's the claim claim number one
the high fat intake of keto diets
teaches you
somehow teaches your body to burn more
fat for fuel and by doing this
keto puts your body into a special
fat burning state and thus
keto burns more fat than other
comparable diets with the same calories
those are basically the three kind of
interlocking claims
now here's why these claims are wrong
your body does in fact burn more fat
when you're on keto
because you're eating more fat and it's
burning the fat that you're eating
and it's not burning any extra body fat
whatsoever that we wouldn't predict by
calories plain and simple
okay second point the generation and
metabolism of ketones because keto
people are obsessed with ketosis my
ketosis they got keto strips
ketosis offers no special net
fat burning results whatsoever it just
doesn't enhance fat burning in any
magical way so if you're doing a keto
diet and you're in ketosis versus not in
ketosis
it doesn't matter for fat loss at all
in a direct sense at the very least
we'll get to some indirect stuff in a
bit
laboratory studies have been conducted
on keto diets and regular diets for a
generation
when the calories are equated it doesn't
matter how many of them come from
protein and carbs and fats and so on and
so forth
the amount of weight you lose is
basically the same
no matter where your macros come from if
the calories are the same and the
magnitude of the deficit is the same
if you eat decent amount of protein in
both diets that are high fat and low fat
high carb versus low carb then you
actually conserve just about the same
amount of muscle
probably a little bit more even in the
not uh super high fat diets
but i get ahead of myself so once you
eat a higher protein diet
whether or not you cut your calories a
bunch from fats
which is not keto because you have a lot
left for carbs or you go keto
and you leave a ton of fats in but very
few carbs
it doesn't really matter at the end of
the day almost the entire
difference doesn't exist you burn pretty
much the same amount of fat and lose the
same amount of weight
no matter which one you're on okay
calorie deficit is the key and if you
generate calorie deficit by slicing a
bunch of your carbs away sweet it works
if you generate a calorie deficit by
slicing away a bunch of your fats
that works too just the same way now
there are some silver linings with keto
because you know a lot of people do keto
and they do observe and sometimes get
really good results
it's not just an illusion here's the
deal there's a couple things that are
going on here
not all people but some people notice an
appreciable reduction of appetite
through a couple of different pathways
when they do keto they're just not as
hungry especially after a few days or a
few weeks
and that causes them to eat fewer
calories than otherwise would or causes
them to cheat less than they otherwise
would
and then they lose more weight in
addition to that
a lot of times what people do is they
don't track their calories nearly as
much as they'd like to believe
they sort of just eat stuff and when
they go to keto the amount of tasty
things you can eat
radically falls off the map because
almost all of the favorite cheat foods
that you have almost all the snackable
foods that you love that cause you to
overeat
they're not keto they have carbs
and fats in them
and if you cut out carbs almost entirely
man like
you know goldfish snacks are gone i
don't even know the point of life is at
that point
potato chips are gone ice cream is gone
you guys ever tried keto ice cream it's
not the same
burgers are gone because who eats a
burger with no bun how much of that are
you gonna crave not much
fries pizza pasta there's all the foods
that people overeat
gone because they're not keto so that's
another big help
some people get a sense of mental calm
when they're doing keto
which coupled with the reduction in
appetite can make it a really
sustainable diet at least in the medium
term for them and once they in the keto
groove
they're going they're just they're not
they don't have the ups and downs of
super high carb intake
and weird mood stuff some people do
experience and then they're just good
and their adherence is really good they
stick to that calorie deficit and then
they get really great results
and they'll say oh my god i'm getting
great results because of keto it's like
yeah
keto lets you do the calorie deficit
which is what's actually getting you the
great results
right and because of this lots of people
lose a lot of fat and a lot of weight
and then they think keto is this magical
thing and
they're wrong because it's not a magical
thing but sometimes it's effective for
some people
especially on an adherent side so best
practices
what do we do what do we take away from
this first of all if you want to lose
fat you absolutely can do keto there's
not a damn thing wrong with it
unless you're an athlete you're
interested in maximum muscularity
maximum sport performance carbs just
beat fats almost every single time
so high carb diets are a really good
idea then but if you're just a regular
person who just wants to lose weight
lose fat keto is totally cool any other
healthy diet
that controls calories and eats feeds
you mostly healthy foods is also just
fine
because there's nothing magical about
keto if you do
keto and you try it because some people
try keto over and over and they fail at
it they don't know why
some people try keto over and over and
they get tons of success
if you are going to be trying keto it
should be because
you get consistent results from it via
easier hearings if you're the kind of
person
that's like dude every time i do keto i
lose like 15 pounds in three months it's
awesome
i come back i only gained five pounds so
over the couple years i've lost like 30
or 40 pounds doing keto every now and
again and then coming back to a healthy
diet like
dude you're the man keep keep doing it
but for every person like that
there's like three people they're like
oh i'm trying keto again it's so tough i
hate it just makes me binge
if i don't go without carbs for three or
four days i freak out and i just want
all the carbs in the world but stop
doing that
it's literally the only benefit of keto
is if it enhances your adherence
and if it's decreasing your adherence
it's only a cost
it's the biggest cost in the world stop
trying but the reason people keep trying
is people keep telling them keto is
magic
it magically burns fat you gotta try and
they're like okay i'll try it for the
fifth time it never works for me but
i'll try it don't do that
don't do that it's a bad idea all right
at the end of the day
in all of the diets that you select stop
looking for magic because it's not real
it doesn't exist
there's no fat burning furnace
your body's not going to like switch its
metabolism some weird way and all of a
sudden you're eating all these tasty
great foods you're not hungry anymore
you're burning fat it just doesn't
happen
right so if you're looking for this diet
like ooh i could just cut my calories
into healthy foods
but i want the super crazy edge what if
i eat only this kind of food or that
kind of food you're looking for
nowhere nothing in nowhere is going to
help you so cut it out
stick to the basics and if you're going
to do keto
think long term right keto can be great
but you're probably not going to do keto
for the rest of your life unless you're
a joyless who hates carbs and
good things
redundant because that's the same thing
after you're done doing keto if keto
works well for you
have a plan to slowly reintroduce
carbohydrates starting with more veggies
then leading into more fruits perhaps
fresh fruits then into some whole grains
then all of a sudden
you've lost all the weight you needed to
from keto or whatever you did for that
phase
you're reintroducing normal good healthy
foods you don't just
don't go from keto to like swedish fish
candy then you'll overeat you'll be
bloated you'll be miserable
slowly increase with low glycemic
vegetable-based carbs first
then fruits and after a few weeks some
whole grains and then regular grains and
then you're back to being a normal
person
and you've transitioned your metabolism
has healed your psychology is healed
you're not
feeling restricted anymore and then
you've lost all that weight and you've
kept it off
keto is a powerful tool for some people
it is not a magic tool and make sure it
is a powerful tool for you
if it works use it transition
intelligently
if it doesn't work for you to enhance
your adherence and if it makes your
adherence to diets worse
stop using it because you can continue
on in life without being a magical fat
burning furnace i promise
folks see you next time for the next
diet myth
