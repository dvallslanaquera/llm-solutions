so our airbnb had some mass gainer and
brad just discovered that that is the
serving size
how are you gonna mix that up dude i
don't know
[Music]
he probably has a blender somewhere
[Music]
dude you're supposed to put the water in
first so it doesn't clump definitely
gonna want to use a blender for that man
like weight gainer is so thick it's good
it's just like
there's like no taste it's like oh
really yeah so i don't think my scale is
working because
uh
this is all that i get um so
i'm gonna have some oats but i guess
what i'll probably do is just
measure these out school style with the
measuring cups go with half a cup not
that i really care because i don't
really need to be laying stuff out but i
do like to weigh out like say my meats
[Music]
volumetric measurements are going to be
less precise and probably a little less
accurate than
weighing it on a scale
however
precision
is not all that important especially
when you're in the off season whether
you're using measuring cups or a scale
or whatever
as long as you have some idea of what
you're eating when you are tracking
and that's really all that matters some
cold water and splenda to that that was
how i used to always eat my oats when i
first got into bodybuilding just a
packet of splenda and some cold water i
always make sure i bring splenda with me
when i'm on the road because
i hate all the other artificial
sweeteners
just eat it just like that
it's actually pretty good we are done
with montreal it's like we hardly spend
any time here at all but uh what we're
gonna do now is go for a workout i think
and then from there we're off to toronto
i'm trying to find a gym here in
montreal and the traffic is absolutely
crazy uh in this city i didn't realize
um
just how tough driving here is
um the whole city is under construction
so everywhere you look there's a detour
like you literally you can't go anywhere
there's just a detour everywhere
anyway so i plugged into the gps to go
to good life
and just because i have a membership
there and i just figured that was
simplest and it was a gym i knew of
so i
just drove to good life only to find
that a good life here is a museum
or something like that and not a fitness
facility
so now i'm on my way to another gym it's
called gym montreal
these are pretty clear with their
signage
it's gotta be it
hey that's the camera just trying to get
in there
hey what's up i'm trying to get in

i'm not sure what this place is
okay
so guys i'll show you what i got i'm
gonna attempt to eat this on the road
but i don't know how well that's gonna
go
oh snap i didn't realize that came with
fries i literally thought it was just
chicken and rice but everything went
much better than expected
so guys we're almost at toronto we're
about two hours outside and i stopped to
get a little snack that's what i got
some loaded potato
chips
a snickers bar
and
regular red bull not sugar free
just kidding guys this is my brother's
it sounds like wow that's weird i'm
going to be eating it
open as you enter ontario i hope there's
more food in there 192 kilometers
i'm assuming that's for robin ibuprofen
and more ibuprofen that's actually a
good gift because i do get a lot of
headaches but i was kind of hoping i
just took one right before
