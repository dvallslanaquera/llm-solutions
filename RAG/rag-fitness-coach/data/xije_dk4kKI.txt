oh is it good to be back with your
weekly webinar james hoffman dr mike
isratel
how we doing i'm trying to do the
surprise gerbil
oh i like that one that's a good one
good man how are you
i'm good i found like the greatest toy
that i've ever encountered
unfortunately the dogs like don't give
two fucks about it but i think it's like
the greatest thing ever
ready i'm gonna do a slow slow intro
keep your ears tuned
that's incredible
[Music]
it's i think it's too big for their
mouths but it's hilarious
it makes like a perfect pig sound well
they will grow into it at some point
soon so now i like attack them they'll
be like trying to relax and i'll be like
and they'll be like your dogs already
hate you
yeah and they're already like getting
the fuck out of here man what are you
doing
they're like we'd all all uh all
included documentary
like they interview the dogs like what's
it like to live with
dr hoffman they're like you know yeah
he's
he's fine he's one of the dogs is like
the other one's like okay yeah okay like
he'd get a little annoyed you get
annoying
until pig comes out we hate the pig
i can't get enough of the pig it cracks
me up
all right pig shall we begin yes
let's i'll screen share here ready to go
[Music]
boom
so our first victim who actually has two
questions that made it into the webinar
this week
because they got uploaded so well uh
nicely done
yeah i figure if people want to hear
stuff they get to hear stuff um
charles austin got it
says um can you guys discuss
the uh august 10th publication of
re mesocycle progression and hypertrophy
by eric helms in the team
for the viewers that don't know the
publication argues amongst other things
that progressing up to mrv may be
sub-optimal and a misapplication of
overload is that the one that was in
response to your guys's article
that's is that my yes okay yeah i didn't
read it i honestly full disclosure i
didn't read it i kind of glanced at it i
um i didn't read the whole thing so i
read it a bunch
so i'll just uh share a couple of quick
views so if you want extended views
you just uh go on the renaissance
partization site and one of the most
recent blog posts from a couple
months ago uh it's just a little bit of
scrolling is a response to
not just that article but a response to
a number of videos
and other discussions that eric his
colleagues and a number of other folks
not associated have sort of
critiques they have leveled against the
going from media to mrv idea
and adding sets and that is uh james
coauthored that
with myself and jared feather and i
believe anch
and um that was
very it's very extensive so it'll give
you everything as far as picking apart
those points
um you know just for some timeline
context right so you you
jared and somebody else wrote something
that got published
right and that got published in the
journal strength conditioning
one of those um and then they wrote a
response piece um critiquing some of the
points
and then mike myself jared and uh i
think
made uh just kind of like a bulleted
like
uh response to their response just yeah
and it wasn't just context
to a bunch of other similar critiques i
figured we'd all won the
it actually came out um or significantly
earlier than their piece did
um because they were you know a couple
of us folks were already
doing podcasts and stuff like that felt
it was right to say something
so you can look into that more
extensively just a couple of real quick
points the ones you bring up
amongst other things that progressing up
to mrv may be suboptimal progressing up
to mrv may be suboptimal
but the cutoff of when to stop any
earlier would be to some extent
arbitrary
and could be presented with a lot
with a few really nasty um questions
that are difficult to answer
in the framework in which i understand
that they've presented for example why
aren't you continuing to train more
why are you stopping here um in if you
don't go all the way up to mrv
you choose to stop and deload any other
point before someone could say why are
you
deloading now if you're still making
performance gains
um and you're still responding well to
training seemingly why are you deloading
and it's a very difficult question to
answer so
james and i aren't saying that mrv is
something you have to go to
there are some compelling reasons why
maybe stopping short of it is a good
idea
but they're not so compelling that they
cancel out the other skeptical reasons
of why not keep going um
so i think the the balance of the logic
is that if you go to mrv and no further
you're sort of cutting the middle road
there going beyond mrv
has some serious questions about it but
stopping much short of mrv
and the real big question is how much
shorter why is that a non-arbitrary
place to stop
is there's a real thing um and then the
misapplication of overload
um
how do i say this politely uh
maybe there was a misapplication of
overload in the way that we wrote the
article but i can guarantee you like
james and i and uh certainly carl juneau
and thiago and jared and myself who
wrote the original article
do not misunderstand overload highly
highly prepared
to engage on incredibly technical
grounds if necessary about what overload
means
um and i think that was
maybe it's an interesting critique but i
think that other critiques of theirs are
much more solid ground yeah and that
one's kind of a silly one because um
yeah well it's silly in the in the idea
that um i think their critique was kind
of looking at overload in a very narrow
scope
uh but what we know is overload is very
contextual right it's contextual to what
you are doing
and in this case the intensity is
something that
is a box checker like as long as you're
kind of within this absolute load and
this
relative load you're good right and
that's a very broad range and then the
big modulating variable in hypertrophy
as we've been saying for years at this
point seems to be
volume everything kind of seems to be
pointing at that so long as frequency
and intensity are in
otherwise appropriate ranges so um
in that case like the the main overload
stimulus is really going to be coming
from
the volume and you can't just go from
very low stimulus to maximal stimulus
and that's why we have that progression
built in do you necessarily have to
progress
no but we think it's a pretty good idea
for a variety of reasons that we've
outlined many many times
um and more specifically to cut you off
real quick
it's the reasons to not progress that
have to be questions at least as much as
resistant for best
yeah so there's just as many don't
progress as kind of like oh okay so
so so t so tldr our position could be
summarized is this
if you're doing x number of sets per
session for or whatever number of weeks
you're no longer getting very good pumps
you're getting essentially almost no
soreness your performance within the
session is not indicating a lot of
fatigue
do you suspect that you're maybe not
training hard enough and if you think
you are training hard enough how do you
know that
you're clearly not challenging the
physiology in any way that is detectable
subjectively in any sense
so if you are comfortable training with
very little pump with very little
soreness
if not at all and with no detectable
intracession fatigue buildup to the
target muscle
and you're comfortable telling yourself
that x number of sets that you've chosen
is still a good number to promote the
optimal amount of hypertrophy
you're comfortable training without any
of those things occurring
uh i tip my hat to you and and wish you
best uh james and i are personally not
comfortable
um guaranteeing optimum hypertrophy when
the signs of disruption
and uh sort of homeostatic disruption
and pushing
close to limits are just not really
there nearly as much as they were
so we would at that point decide there's
an elevation stimulus required
yeah and i'll i'll just make two more
points so we don't belabor the topic too
much but like a really classic example
i think i've said this on a different
webinar is like just take two weeks of
vacation from lifting
right just take two weeks off and then
when you come back
try to do what you did in that
overreaching week before you went on
vacation see what happens
right uh you will you will find that
that is a pretty good
at least and it's anecdote but it's
pretty solid to show that it's probably
not in your best interest to
pursue the same crushing volumes that
you were doing after taking some time
off and there might be a progression
that's warranted in some of these
instances at the very least
but it makes sense um and the second
point i was going to make which
oh i remember there is like there are
very specific instances where we would
recommend against
training uh up to mrv and here's a
really easy one to understand i think
for most people and
you're gonna roll your eyes because you
know it's coming from me uh when you
have people who do sports
uh it's probably not in your best
interest if you have a sporting athlete
who's maybe team sports
and they are doing body composition
alteration to actually train any given
body part to mrv
maybe stopping a little bit short and
just going up to an mav is
is probably a better idea why is that
because it's just sapping too many of
their training resources that is going
to take away from the other things that
they're doing their
fitness their skills and tactics in
other areas so that's a perfect example
of like when you say okay i got a soccer
player
should i be training their quads up to
mrv throughout the next three massive
cycles i'd be like no that's a bad idea
you're not going to be able to run
you're not going to be able to
you know do any of your soccer stuff and
there's just an easy way
we would say this is again there's a
individualization there's some context
where we say like yeah sometimes it's a
good idea if you're just doing physique
training
if you're doing other things like yeah
of course you wouldn't do that it
doesn't make sense
next up just uh one one comment down is
airy small eerie he's he's uh been on a
roll with some good
good questions hey so he says hi ducks
what is the optimal approach to take
when you can't train a large area for
body data injury
using a lower body debilitating injury
as an example should you keep the muscle
cycle similar to your usual training
and just remove any lower body exercises
or should you increase frequency
and volume of upper body training due to
reduced systemic fatigue for not
training the lower body so it's actually
a very simple answer this question
the big thing to watch out for is
assuming that systemic fatigue
is always and everywhere keeping your
upper body from progressing to higher
volumes and
uh faster jumps in load and so on and so
forth
and then it turns out that some of those
muscles were already at their local
limit and then doing more
just fucks them up completely so i would
say train
begin at the usual uh volumes that you
would mehs same frequency of upper body
and start to auto regulate
uh and you will see if your systemic
fatigue has opened up any avenues for
you
and all of a sudden at the end of that
meso you'll be like wow
i managed to do way more volume and get
way more progress and train way more
consistent weeks without a deload
however way you structure it then i
would if i was training legs this is
great
but because using all regulatory fashion
you're not top down and posing like this
will for sure be better because you have
no idea
they might be like training chest twice
a week with your scheme was still the
best idea maybe you only got two more
sets out of it per week
but maybe your systemic fatigue was
really holding your chest back not local
and you could double your volume and get
a way a ton more growth
once you do one meso like that and
you've really sort of felt out the
landscape
and you get into a place where you're
like dude i'm so full of energy and my
muscles are so locally not um
taxed that i'm like doing 15 cents per
session here with chest
twice a week i'm gonna go three times a
week because i can smash that much more
volume definitely systemic fatigue is
not a factor maybe it wouldn't be able
to survive it before
but now that i don't have any legs
they've been cut off for this example
um then i can do way more chest and then
you can start expanding your frequency
so i would say
probably hold your frequency the same
auto regulate to see how much real room
you have that's
more room and then rearrange the
frequency based on if you need to
accommodate a higher frequency
because you're extended beyond 10 sets
per session and your systemic fatigue is
not budging
that was a really good answer i'm gonna
come at it from a different angle um so
when you say debilitating leg injury so
like to mike and i
that means like a railroad tie like blew
off and impaled you in the leg
and you literally can't move right um
what most people mean by that is they
have like a quad pull or a groin pull
or you know maybe a torn hamstring and
those are all legitimate injuries
but um me personally i wouldn't consider
those to be debilitating because they
they can be worked around so before you
go really
just giving up and abandoning their legs
i'm pretty confident you can find
something to do now granted it might not
be the
hardest thing and you can basically like
for example if you can't squat you can't
deadlift you can't
45 degree back raise you can't do any of
that stuff maybe you can do a knee
extension maybe you can do like a single
leg glute bridge
and maybe that's just the best you've
got but you can probably find something
and if you do that can you basically
just take what dr mike said
anyway to your upper body and do all
those steps probably because it's pretty
minimally fatiguing
um but i think people are quick to jump
the gun and say
i can't train upper body or lower body
or whatever
they're quad and they're like i'm
training no no lower body it's like you
still have glutes you still have
hamstring stuff caps
you still have plenty of things that you
could do and if you get creative
um you can find little workarounds and
the thing with hypertrophy training
is it's much more forgiving than like
strength training or sport training
as long as you are meeting some basic
criteria of absolute and relative
intensities
and putting in some reasonable volumes
you can get something out of it it might
not be the best growth stimulus you've
ever had
but you can probably at least hit like
an mev for some muscle groups which is
perfect
so don't be quick to abandon um just
because you have an injury
again when mike and i hear debilitating
that that means like
you're on crutches or you can't walk
you're in a wheelchair or something like
that right
more often than not it's like okay you
got a pretty good groin pull you got a
pretty good
maybe your your si joints flaring up and
you can't do some other things but
maybe you can do something and and start
there and then
use the steps that dr mike outlined for
adjusting your upper body training
charles austin again right below harry
smith yeah
got it three questions we snuck a couple
on this
one it's really awesome
number one or actually preface can you
guys talk about programming out of town
here a few scenarios
so just a quick blurb sorry to interrupt
you mike um i actually wrote this
great article i think it's great because
i wrote it of course
um it's called it travel like a sports
scientist where i wrote this huge thing
about like
here's like things that we've learned
from all of our travels around the world
about how to do traveling well it
included
diet advice training advice a bunch of
miscellaneous stuff
and then this covid thing happened and i
had to just fucking
sit on that article for the for
indefinitely at this point and i was so
mad i was like damn it i wrote a good
one and no one's gonna give a shit now i
gotta update it with like masks and shit
god damn it yeah or just wait until like
the vaccine comes
and then you're good to go yeah didn't
they it was
i'm not really watching the news much
but i i heard through the grapevine that
there was
uh russia was claiming to have some kind
of vaccine it's did you hear anything
about it
yeah yeah they do and they've been using
it so we'll see if it works oh
cool putin for the win look we have
vaccine yes
it's called death if you have covered we
give you vaccine in back of car
all right num can you guys talk about
programming out of town here a few
scenarios number one no access to any
gym
or any equipment do you just do your
best to eat at maintenance calories and
then pick up where you left off and get
back so we're going to be answering this
in the context of like an intermediate
to advanced pretty serious physique
strength person
because like if you're just a beginner
and you're working out like you can just
do some push-ups and
some you know bodyweight lunges and
you're good to go um
generally i would say yes you eat at
maintenance calories and pick up where
you left off unless you're
going away for an ordered amount of time
that's a real good idea james agreed
yeah and i mean like something is better
than nothing even if you just did like
three sets of push-ups to failure is it
the best no
is it at least like hitting maybe an mv
like yeah okay
that's not bad um at that point your
goal is really just
mv to the best of your ability
next you have access to bands and or
like dumbbells
do you do your best to replicate your
workouts and continue your diet eg
balkan cup so
i would still say um you can continue to
bulk and cut
uh that's fine but maintenance is also
consideration there
do you replicate your workout no you
follow
modification of workout principles when
training with dumbbells for example some
very similar ones apply to bands
if you go on the rp website
rhodosauserization.com in the blog
just a few months ago when covet started
uh i put out a really
i thought it was fine blog post about
how to train at home modifications for
at-home training with limited equipment
and it really is quite different like
you're going to go way closer to failure
your exercise selection is going to be
different your frequency is going to be
different your volume is going to be
different
um you're going to use some like rest
pauses and all this other stuff so it's
gonna be different
don't just say okay i had barbell squats
here and i'm doing dumbbell squats
that's not how it works because
if you just you can't do three by ten
dumbbell squats unless you have 180
pound dumbbells
like that so um give that article a
couple aunts and uncles to hand them to
you
exactly so just just give that some
thought about it's going to be different
but you can still probably manage for
sure
and then number three have access to a
gym but have to choose different
exercises for example a home gym
has a 45 degree hack squat and new gym
has a standing hack spot variant so so
this is actually super easy answer
you pick the most analogous exercises
that you can
okay and it's like look if it gets close
it's fine
like james and i don't even think we
think of like pressing move
curly move rowing move like it's that
simple okay
if you if you can get more and more
accommodating like if you have an
incline versus a flat variant do the one
that you were gonna do but if you just
have one
it's okay right and second of all do
a number of working sets that check
checklist the box of a really good
stimulus you got a robust pump
you got uh you know some fatigue in the
muscle which will
result in a performance loss after a
number of sets uh stuff like that
as far as volume and make sure that
you're in a similar rep range
uh not even remotely it doesn't have to
be like okay i got 13 reps here but i
got 15 oh no
like if it's between 10 and 20 you're
doing just fine and if you do one set
that's hard and it's between 5 and 10 by
accident then just takes some weight off
and the next set still counts as a hard
set
right so you do that and make sure your
proximity to failure
is roughly where you were going to be
for that week anyway
and you're fucking golden i would say
that if you did completely different
pieces of equipment every single week
but progressed from roughly three hour
to zero rer
through a mesocycle and every time you
trained you're trained to get a robust
pump and a good stimulus and some
fatigue
the difference between that and having
the same equipment every time for
strength is different it's tough for
hypertrophy the difference with that
would be detectable only the largest
longest studies where incredibly finite
precision equipment was used
i mean you can get incredible because
anything is a lot of ifbb pros literally
train like that
they just do different shit even at
their own gym every single workout and
they do just fine
the stimulus and this is something
actually that brian miner and eric helms
are really good about saying
um the stimulus presentation of overload
is it's just a very general concept
train the muscle
hard with similar movements and make
sure to do enough sets to get the job
done
and the details just don't matter a ton
it's nothing to worry about
and the reason i'm saying it's nothing
to worry about and james can share i'm
sure more than a few client stories
about this
people freak out about this a lot and
they never should
they get to a gym in a hotel in mexico
and they're like there's only a smith
machine
there's no actual free squad what do i
do it's as if no one
ever got a nasty legwork out of a smith
machine james
yeah absolutely and uh i i agree with
everything you said and i just love the
example he gave in this one where he's
like okay you have a 45 degree axe squat
versus an upright axe but
like i wouldn't even that that wouldn't
even register in my brain i'd be like
sweet hack squad
carry on like that's how minor that is
that's like a simple
another example would be like you were
doing regular lateral raises and then
you were doing thumbs down lateral
raises it's like
it's the same thing it's you know what i
mean you don't have to think about it
too hard that might be like an over
um your paralysis by analysis kind of
thing you're just overthinking it a
little bit
so yeah like mike said earlier it's
really just kind of breaking it down you
can do it either by kind of like
movement types or you can do kind of
like muscle group types
you know so mike and i tend to do
movement type so it's like okay i need a
curling movement i need a pressing
movement
kind of a squatting or sometimes you
just say like a quad movement like you
go to a hotel gym and maybe they don't
have
a smith machine or a leg press or
anything they have like a knee extension
machine and
maybe you do some sissy squats and some
knee extensions and you're like okay i
got quads checked good enough like
that's good that's the best i can do um
more often than not though and this is
something i was really
adamant about in my article which never
got released
it's just with a little bit of foresight
a little bit of planning when you're on
the road
and you are um going different places
whatever there's almost always a place
that you can drop into and it just takes
a little bit effort on your part to look
ahead of time
dr mike's really good about this i know
he reaches out to people just says hey
i'm going to be in
xyz can we pop in for a couple you know
sessions and almost always they'll say
yes
or you know pay a drop in fee for
whatever um right now with covet it's
kind of different because sometimes
people are not doing i've noticed people
aren't doing the drop-in fees they might
ask you for like a month
membership or something but for the most
part pre-covert
you can uh mostly if you just do a
little bit of detective work on your own
which is like okay google search where
you are open maps and then type gym near
me
you'll almost always find something your
boy has been to the arctic circle
not twice but three times at this point
and i have found places to work out
you can do it it's doable yeah there's
plenty that's the thing so there's
always going to be
uh where there's a will there's a way
now i'm not saying you should like spend
your whole
travel time uh doing your normal five
six day workouts at the gym it's gonna
cost a lot of money if you're doing
dropping fees it's gonna cost a lot of
time and fuss
but you certainly can get like two to
three days in and stay mostly on track
with what you're doing
and that's great and if you're somebody
who's asking a complicated question like
this
on rp plus or on youtube like it's
probably worth the effort
for you boom
arnold pal montes
he says oh yes hey docs i just noticed
that i have never thanked you for
answering my questions i truly
appreciate your effort answering my
boring questions they're great questions
months why don't you ever say that
uh thanks so much for asking them and
we're absolutely happy and thank you for
thanking us
um next question from him is if muscle
protein synthesis lasts shorter than
soreness which
usually does does the application of
supplemental recovery strategies
reduce the potential of adaptation even
after a few days
after a training session if soreness has
not yet dissipated so the first thing i
would say is i don't believe this has
been studied directly
um james on pure theoretical grounds
what do you think
i'm not sure because a lot of the
supplemental strategies
have a direct timeline of use and so
what you
you might run into is uh you might be
using them
in such a way where uh the application
of the strategy like ice for example if
you're doing it like days later
it's not going to have the effect that
you want there's actually it doesn't
reduce sourness then
right what you're saying right yeah so
it's kind of like um
i'm not sure if it even is having the
positive effect so it probably doesn't
have the interference effects either
at that point now there are other ones
like using a compression sleeve for
example where you might run into that
type of situation
and as dr mike said i don't think that's
ever been looked at at least in the
context of comparing
the the intersection of soreness
protein synthesis and the interference
effects of using the supplemental
strategies
from a theoretical standpoint man if
that that's like splitting such finite
hairs i don't think that it would make a
measurable difference because we're
already talking about like something
like compression sleep for example
the effect sizes of using the
compression sleeve is already
so small
the timing relative to the soreness god
i can't
i can't imagine there being a big effect
there maybe there is an effect but like
what i'm saying is the the effect size
of using that method is already so small
the timing of the method i'm not sure
yeah james that's a really good answer
the only thing i'll add
is in my personal experience using
the supplemental strategies like icing
or heating
or ibuprofen or compression
once your peaks soar
nothing reduces your contracts your time
to no longer soar
short of anabolic drugs
crap loads of sleep and a ton of food
and generally just being relaxed
nothing like so you can take a bunch of
advil
or ibuprofen after your peak soar after
your peak sore
and then you'll feel less sore and then
the advil will wear off and you'll feel
just a sore
same timeline as you were before and
you're like fuck now if you take advil
this is very well established if you
take ibuprofen
right after you train before you get
soared you never actually get as sore as
you ever would
now that also interferes we know with
hypertrophy
so i suspect that some of these
modalities don't actually interfere with
hypertrophy
if you take outside of the window of
when the soreness is
starting to come but i also suspect that
like james said
they probably don't help either like you
go into an ice tank
or an ice bath you know two days after
your quads hit peak soreness you're
coming out
feeling better an hour later you're just
as sore as you ever were and you're like
okay i didn't do anything
right and and then the only question
becomes is how you would use this in
practice
if you have a hard squat session coming
up in a couple hours should you take
ibuprofen to mitigate the soreness
so that you can squat i mean that's bad
on a couple of grounds one that's a
really great way to get hurt because you
can no longer perceive pain as well
terrible idea um and also that will leak
into the post-workout window and the
intra-workout
molecular signaling cascades are now
occurring in in the
uh presence of ibuprofen uh which is
probably not great
so i would say mantas like yeah no it's
actually not a concern but also it's of
no help
my hypothesis here in this situation
yeah and just just to kind of put the
nail on the coffin on this one if you
are somebody
who is primarily focused on hypertrophy
and physique
the supplemental strategies are
something you're going to use very
sparingly anyway
if you are someone who is a sporting
athlete who does hypertrophy training
for their sport
it's something you can entertain maybe
slightly more than the other
uh physique-minded person but still
during your general preparatory periods
you want to minimize the use as much as
possible
anyway so i would say you don't want to
do anything
with the supplemental strategies that
are going to deliberately reduce
soreness in some capacity that's
probably a bad strategy but there are
things like i i would not if you were
like man
my elbow's kind of wonky and i've just
noticed that like if i put the
compression sleeve on there
it kind of makes it feel better over
time i'd be like yeah just fucking put
it on i don't care
who cares yes it's not going to make a
hill of beans difference
[Music]
all right perry battles
everyone's british today why not oh he's
got his actual picture on there and he's
playing
yeah assuming that's his actual picture
skeptical mike doesn't look he looks
like it is dude youtube people do shit
all the time
um i use the word people charitably when
i talk about youtubers just kidding you
guys
gotta be the doctors i received i
received an email saying be nice
that's right that's a good idea hello
doctors mike and james i have a
technical question about functional
reaching now if james and i
could still get erect this kind of shit
support size
gets us real let's say that i'm in week
four of a 401 accumulation deal a
paradigm and i squat twice per week
if i fail to match reps on the first
squat workout of that week does that
mean that i technically functionally
overreached
after the second squat session in week
three
uh maybe maybe so the answer is maybe if
you actually uh
cannot come back and do better than that
performance in that second session
then yes but if that second session goes
better or at the level that you're
normally used to performing
then that other session the week for
session one you're describing
was just a fluke bad performance and we
can't actually say that you were
overreached they could just i've
underperformed
for any number of reasons have nothing
to do with exceeding your recovery
capacity
james is that uh yeah totally i was just
gonna say you could just be having a bad
day you could be having stressors could
just like
maybe you woke up in the middle of the
night and had to go pee and didn't get
one is rested like whatever it could be
any number of things
especially that early on in the
mesocycle like assuming you're like an
intermediate
pre you have you've got a pretty good
idea of where you should be and where
you're gonna go
you know what i mean i would you don't
see people
who are cognizant of the volume
landmarks
really functional overreaching in week
one you know no no this is week three
james week three
but he's asking about
if he fails to match oh wait sorry
oh wait oh okay sorry i missed i
misunderstood my bad uh week three so
basically in week five
yeah week three okay yeah in week four
session one he like ate shit
that did week three session two
overreach him it could have
maybe but but maybe it's a fluke
performance so let's see what else he
says
and again like it could be other things
too sorry uh just like the sympath the
more the easiest one that we would
normally point our finger at is like did
you just progress too high in your
intensity yeah
totally yeah it's just too much um
the reason i ask is that i've observed
this phenomenon repeatedly and myself
across the decently wide spectrum
squatting volumes i progress fine during
weeks one to three
then fail to match reps sometimes during
week four
my question is have i already gotten the
benefit of functional reaching at the
end of week three and should i end the
accumulation there
and deload in week four anticipating
missed reps due to repeated incidents of
that phenomenon
or does it make sense to have a whole
week of training during which i miss
reps in every session because session
one and two for body parts before i
deload
i use squad as a simple example but this
often happens across various body parts
so what you need to do
is one of two things one when you
overreach take a a light session or a
recovery session
and then come back and hit it hard the
next session and
or note that for next time and be a
little bit easier in progressing volumes
and loads to make sure it doesn't happen
either way is cool but what i would say
is this if you
are squatting for three workouts in a
row and you have a four to one paradigm
for the rest of your body and it works
great
and every time week four is the one that
sucks yeah clearly then you are
overreaching right and then
the question is like why are you still
squatting at a three to one paradigm
in a four to one structure it fucks your
whole program up so
which maybe a suggestion we'd have is
progress the same
but week two session two take a recovery
session
that'll give you just enough extra boost
to finish out those four weeks strong
boom problem solved because like there's
no guarantee that all of your muscles
are going to reach mrv at the same time
there's just not
and then if you puts around and try to
reduce them or increase them a little
bit more
you could get away from optimality so
there may be a time for inserting a
recovery session just so your squat
can keep up with your other muscles
that's totally fine
or you know that you're not going to
reach the end until
a certain point and if it's within just
whatever general soreness and
fatigue that doesn't screw up your
workouts a ton like you don't want to be
like okay week one i don't overreach
week four so i'm gonna do one set of
everything but clearly there's just a
shitty workout right
but if you can still have great workouts
and maybe progress a little bit less
rapidly
then just keep that in mind because the
idea is not just to progress every
session
but the idea is to make sure that the
entire accumulation phase sees mostly
progress
i mean you could fuck shit up and
basically every week over each on one
session and then take the other one as
recovery but then you're training
productively half as much as you
otherwise were james
yeah that was really good uh so i agree
with everything dr mike said but i would
like to just kind of funnel
my opinion into maybe a couple of those
select areas so when i'm reading this it
says i progress fine during which one to
three and then fail to match rep
sometimes during week four
it looks like that's in the context of
his squat workouts right
so if your other muscle groups aren't
missing reps
and you are missing reps on your squat
workouts specifically in week four
then the answer is very clearly that
you're just going too hard on the
progressions between one and three on
the squatting or the quads in general
that seems to
to me that seems to be the glaring issue
whereas if your other muscle groups
all seem to be mostly fine um then you
just need to tone down your progression
deloading one muscle group like quads
during
week three and then continuing to train
on week four with the other muscle
groups just seems silly at that point
and if that's the case then again it
kind of goes back to that previous point
of
well if everything else can keep being
trained productively and just not quads
it just means that your quad progression
is fucked up somewhere
so my my strongest suggestion i agree
with all the things that mike said
if you were to ask me i would narrow my
focus into looking at my
mev2 you know mav progressions for quads
and maybe just dialing back a little bit
and see if that alleviates the problem
because that that to me is like the
glaring issue although
it could be any of the other things that
dr mike mentioned i'm maddie mad dog
forberg and for those of you who don't
know me i am a strength coach and a 57
kilogram power lifter on team usa
i like that i can program into the rp
diet app what time i'll be training
and even if it's a light heavy moderate
kind of session
and that will you know differentiate the
kind of macros that i'll need
and it can let me put in how long my
training session is going to be
i use the rp diet app during all seasons
of power lifting whether i'm cutting
weight
bulking up or even right now maintenance
keeping on the same weight that i am
all right tie
t-y just time
[Music]
that's his debut album title just time
there's an mma fighter named tai tuivasa
oh sweet for some reason a lot of debut
titles
the debut albums have just the lamest
fucking titles
like mike israel pieces of me
like shut the fuck up nobody wants to
hear about you motherfucker sing songs
to entertain us god damn it
no need to spill all your private i like
when
yeah totally i like when it's um
self-titled where it's like the artist
name
the album name is the same as the artist
name and the first track is the same as
the artist and album name james hoffman
with hit single james featuring the hit
single
that's right exactly and featuring
assistant
featuring vocal support by james hoffman
senior
your dad like uh oh
somebody somebody uh my dad and i have
the same cpa and he called today he's
like
hey jim i was like hey he's like is this
junior i was like yep he was like oh god
damn it i'm looking for your dad
[Laughter]
that sucks all right it happens
so well ty says
asks should someone be undertaking a
bodybuilder type split if they don't
have a foundation of strength
for example if they can't bench 2530
reps either even a point of admitting
just once a week for 10 to 12 reps and
doing isolation work
or should they be focusing on lower
strength oriented rep ranges
for example five to eight and increasing
their compound lift frequency until they
are quarter quarts strong at which point
they can switch to a conventional
bodybuilder routine with more
oscillation exercises
the reason i ask is that i've been
training for several years with decent
form progressive overload in addition to
adequate rest and recovery nutrition
i've tried push-pull legs upper lower
and a lower frequency split but i still
don't look or feel strong
strong is not a feeling by the way
strong as an objective measurement we
can get back to that a sec
recently i've switched to five sets of
three and hit the main compounds twice a
week sticking to a few select isolation
moves
for example bicep curls and rear duct
flies god i hope he's not doing
biceps and rear flies five by three
should i continue with this until i can
hit decent strength numbers or am i
approaching this all wrong great channel
all the best so the answer here is
pretty sciency but bear with us
so the fundamental problem with the
bodybuilder bro split is that its
frequency is optimized
for people that are fucking insanely
massive and any overloading workout
that's five to ten working sets
or more requires like five days of
recovery
okay when marcus rule or ronnie coleman
um
when they train chess the shit gets so
fucked up they just can't train it for a
long time after
right however they might want to so
the thing is ty you're not that jacked
neither are james and i
so for people uh females are a classic
example of this
that are smaller they just tend to
recover faster which means if you're
training very infrequently like a super
jack dude who needs the time to recover
then you're training so infrequently
that it really isn't optimizing you know
you're just sitting on your ass a lot
and not stimulating muscle growth and
just kind of twiddling your thumbs and
sometimes even losing a little bit of
muscle between sessions and then
regaining
so will you gain muscle and strength
training each muscle group once a week
with a bro split you will but not as
fast as you could training it two to
four times a week so you should be able
to train something two to four times a
week and if you're on the smaller side
and the not so strong side if recovery
allows basically if you can do between
three and ten work sets per muscle per
session and fit in
x number of sessions per week no problem
sustainably that's your x
like i can do you know side delts for
that many sets
four or five times a week no problem so
that's what i do i can do quads
for that many sets twice a week so
that's what i do right big difference
so you should train every muscle sort of
when it's recovered training it between
you know
between three and ten working sets per
session on average and then you'll find
a natural place where you're best off
so that's point number one point number
two is for beginners there's some
really really good argument to stay in
the five to ten rep range
so that they build technique as
optimally as possible
especially technique under heavy loads
and then they can transfer it to having
that excellent technique and more
challenging rep ranges in which the
technique is upheld like 10 to 20
and 20 30 because if you can't keep
stable technique in the 5 to 10 rep
range you're sure if hell not ready to
do way more reps or your technique is
going to break down at a total share
so you're probably over that if i can
sort of do a little like cold reading
here you're probably over that stage of
your
training in which you're really just
learning the basic exercises so that's
no longer really going to apply to you
but that's a 5 to 10 or super great
what i will say is a hard no is there is
no prerequisite strength you have to
have to start benefiting from
hypertrophy style training
suboptimal hypertrophy child training
yes you need to be strong enough for
your muscles to need a week to recover
you may never get that strong i'm not
that strong james isn't that strong most
pro bodybuilders aren't that strong
um you know andre melanicev one of the
greatest pilots of all time
you know his deadlift he would train
hard every two or three weeks okay
but you not everyone did lift 400 kilos
for reps right so
you don't have to worry about that kind
of stuff train your muscles as often as
they're covered or ready and go hard
again
there's no cutoff to when you switch to
a bro split a bro split will work better
and better and better for you as you get
bigger and stronger because it will get
closer
to what you should be doing anyway but i
got a real good shortcut for you
just do what you're supposed to be
anyway train your muscles when they
recover
yeah it's really it really is that
simple that was a good answer uh yeah
i'd also like to second putting the
kibosh on the like prerequisite strength
idea it
really has nothing to do with anything
in terms of physique
it's one of those things where it's um
you're almost voluntarily letting your
ego hold you back because you're worried
about
your your how strong you are how strong
you look to other people all
of the above man you don't need any of
that you could just get in there put in
some good quality work like dr mike said
figure out kind of how frequently you
can train each muscle group
and just adjust as you go it doesn't
matter if you can bench 225 or squat 315
or deadlift 405. none of that shit
matters all that matters is what you can
do
can you put in a reasonable relative
effort so
when we say you know you might have
heard us say that earlier in the today's
episode we said absolute intensity
relative intensity absolute intensity is
what you're talking about strength right
how much weight is on the bar
as long as it's challenging for you
you're good then we look at relative
intensity
are you able to hit your kind of rep
range goals like in this case five to
ten
within like a reasonable rir if you can
do those two things like if you're using
a weight
that is challenging at five to ten reps
at two to three rir
dude nothing else matters and at that at
that point you're already on your way
and as you get better you can start
looking at exercises and making better
sfr choices and you can start looking at
your volume landmarks and thinking a
little bit more about mev mav mrv all
those things
but you don't have to worry about the
strength you can just throw that out the
window and i know like we all come from
sporting backgrounds to some degree we
all love i mean like one of the
highlights of my
holiday season was watching the world's
strongest man marathon on espn
right we all love that shit but at some
point you just got to let it go and just
know that
that's not you that's not you it's not
me it's not dr mike like
it's okay you can still be the best you
with hypertrophy training and still be a
jack and
you know and over time you'll become
stronger you'll become a strong guy
just from gaining muscle and that's
perfectly fine so don't let the strength
thing hold you back it's one of those
oh my god the reps and reserve guy got
me so good this week he had a fucking
golden one mike did you see the one with
the um i didn't see it
no he had a fucking golden one it was
the um you know the meme where it's like
the buff shiba and then kind of like the
feeble sheba
so the buff shiva was like bodybuilders
in the 80s and it was like
dead lifts like passes out and then
keeps working out anyway
and it was like bodybuilders today like
coach i did ir3 instead of
or did re-r2 instead of r3 d-load please
like oh my god that's so true that's one
of these instances like don't think
about it
just get in there go put in the work
trying to figure out where this thing
came from and i think i have a suspicion
i think a lot of people who were doing
um
essentially just not frequent enough
heavy training
uh switch from bro splits to
you know starting strength or something
like that and now they're finally
stimulatively training more frequently
and they d they also work progressively
overloading on purpose before and now
they are
and they um essentially
that's why they got better and they told
everyone else that like
you i like you have to get stronger
first and then
you know and then things work the
problem is that like
that example does happen those people
like that for every one of those there's
at least one
bro in new jersey that started training
when he was 17 with a bro split
gained 40 pounds of muscle his first
year 20 pounds the second year 15 pounds
a third
and is now 27 years old and vying for
the mr olympia and he didn't fucking
know anything and he's just fucking huge
so you got to remember that like that
story is a narrative that
works it's true but it's not the only
one that works so
and and just to like bolster your your
your viewpoint here i mean there's
before we even switched over to doing
youtube we had a bunch of regular
uh rp plus people like khalid and some
other people who were always saying like
i want to be a jacked guy and i want to
be strong like
and there's plenty of good options out
there like if you should if that's
something that tickles your fancy
dr mike and i will tell you like think
about periodizing and maybe pick one and
then pick another and then
you know sequence them in such a way but
you could also look at the like chad's
uh
jugger not uh power building uh thing
looks like it's doing really really well
people are getting really really good
results on that and that's kind of like
a nice mix of the two
where you're getting jacked and getting
strong maybe not the
the most perfect for being as strong as
possible or as jacked as possible but
some people want to be somewhere in the
middle and that might
be something up your alley yeah
nicola nicola colif
oh you you skipped fake natty i think
maddie has only two likes jamo he didn't
make her cut off
i know i just like this better question
sorry your fellow youtubers
are not approving enough you have a good
name just get a good question
better questions uh or worse questions
the ones that youtubers like better
so uh nicola has two questions
first one in the context of muscle
building does it matter if a noticeable
amount of calories
for carbs are made up from sugar in the
form of candy does sugar hinder the
muscle building process in any way
no taking into account that we are
eating the right amount of protein uh
if the answer is yes is there any food
that also does this
no except for like alcohol definitely
alcohol and maybe a high intake of
saturated fat
might have some muting effects on muscle
growth but if you're eating a normal a
lot of fats
uh and then if you eat a normal amount
of protein and carbs then you can't
possibly be eating enough fats
to where that makes a huge difference so
it's nothing i would worry about but
that's for
muscle and performance for health you
could eat less candy and eat more fruits
and vegetables
motherfucker get that candy out of here
no i'm just kidding it's f it's funny
but yeah i mean
i would say look you don't want to have
like a substantial percentage of your
daily carbs coming from candy
like man i'm you know what no never mind
i'm going to say that one but yeah it's
not a good steal
i love the ones you can't share um
second question
i have an issue with my lower back
throughout my years of lifting i had
several instances where my lower back
would snap
during a squat or deadlift now this
doesn't happen often yeah but
you know like a jewish injury you know i
might make this is again like like when
you say snap that means something
distinct to me and mike
that means like yeah like but you step
into a slim gym that's right
let's say it's more minor than that uh
so he goes
during squatter deadlift this would
happen now this doesn't happen often so
i still use both squats and deadlifts in
my program because of their high raw
stimulus
but i always have the thought on the
back of my mind that i might snap again
uh then it might snap again that i might
snap again
uh and after a session where uh i have
done one of these exercises i feel like
my back is stiff the next day sometimes
my lower
back is stiff even after i wake up for a
person with these issues would you
suggest
uh to do if they wish to do the exercise
so first of all
is you don't have to do these exercises
but if like you said you wish to do them
i do have a couple of tips one is always
warm up thoroughly people who have never
been hurt can afford to warm up a little
bit and
tell themselves they're fine and
sometimes they are uh you can no longer
do that because you'll really hate
yourself afterwards if you didn't warm
up
look if you get hurt after warming up
thoroughly fuck it sure happens but if
you get hurt after warming up a little
bit and you're like fuck
like it just sucks so warm up thoroughly
first one
second of all don't go hard on those
exercises too many weeks in a row or
sequences in a row so instead of
squatting hard and heavy or death
hard and heavy twice a week do hard and
heavy squats and deadlifts once a week
and then maybe some hat squats and some
specific deadlifts
for the other workout to get a little
variation going to the same micro
structures are being irritated all the
time
and lastly when you progress and load
and it reps and sets make sure to do it
very gingerly and very carefully
everything's okay keep going
if you feel like oh i'm a little tense
i'm all stiff i don't think i recover
from last workout
take a recovery session instead of
getting hurt come back strong the next
time and slowly ease back in
i've done this with a bunch of lifts and
some of them i don't even remember
what i got hurt and when that's how
completely they've healed other ones i
always have to kind of be a little bit
on edge for
but i still get awesome productive
training so those are my thoughts james
you got anything on top of that
um that was a really good answer i just
had like a a thought vomit where um
normally when people
say like i'm kind of hesitant with some
of these movements what we usually say
is like use a lighter loading range like
instead of doing five to ten do ten to
twenty that's unfortunately i missed
that one
but but that but in this context um with
squats and like deadlifts
yeah what are you gonna do deadlifts for
20 fuck that no way um so in that case
you might leave a little bit more in the
tank and i'm not saying like
sorry real quick but james maybe instead
of doing deadlifts for such a five hard
you do them for sets of ten and there's
still a great stimulus but it's not like
the kind of load that would like
really make or break yeah so for any of
those things like the load is what's
really going to exacerbate your your
aside from user error uh in terms of not
warming up and technique and things like
that um the the load is what's going to
be
exacerbating any existing injuries on
there so you would err on the side of
either the lightest
part of that range or maybe even going
one range up now in the case of squats
and deadlifts it gets hard to go up into
that 10 to 20 range
but you might consider doing like up to
15 reps which is tough
but doable like it's definitely vomit
inducing but doable
um or you know keeping up to like 12 11
10 kind of reps and that's a little bit
easier for most people
beautiful all right
fiona
people talk about muscle imbalances as a
source of injury is there any research
on this
yes and almost all the research shows
that they are not a predictor of injury
so unless they're clinical yeah outside
of clinical boundaries right when you
have
massive massive asymmetric asymmetries
this is where you would put two
like if you had somebody standing on a
force plate and they have like twenty
percent of
uh body weight is is eight is as they
have as a 20
discrepancy of like their body weight on
one leg that might be an instance where
they might be more at risk right
but for most people and there's a normal
range of variation in terms of
body positioning joint positioning
muscle strength all those things have
natural asymmetries and within some of
these normal boundaries and
don't quote me on the exact numbers but
it doesn't it doesn't seem to matter
outside of when you really deviate
way outside of some of these ranges yeah
so actually he's asking about something
a little bit different uh
which is interesting the other kind of
imbalanced anterior posterior
antagonistic imbalance
how dangerous would it be for your
immediate power if you're never trained
back or biceps and still do a normal
amount of pressing
would their ship fall apart well almost
all of the best russian lifters train
back
very little in biceps never and they're
the fucking best in the world so
you don't actually have to train those
muscles now there's some
good reason from a long-term uh
perspective of body movement joint
integrity
and actually just strength to where you
probably would want to train those at
least a little bit
but you know the big tons of tons and
tons of back training
tons and tons of bicep training for
power lifting is optional at best
and interferes with power lifting
training you know if you've ever seen
any of shanko's programs
it's like squatting pressing pressing
deadlifting squatting two or three let
exercises go home and you're like
but where is all my bodybuilding work
well he can give a flying fuck what you
look like and if you look at the russian
power lifting team
you know they look like muscular guys
they're not exactly like they don't look
like the americans the americans are
super jacked
except the russians total at least as
much the americans do looking like
much more regular people that might not
be up your alley but it's it's almost
certainly never going to get you hurt if
you if you really think imbalances get
you hurt
take a look at weight lifters how
fucking weak their upper bodies are
compared to their lower bodies
and how super fucking weak their pulling
musculature is a lot of weight lifters
if you're like hey bent over row do
pull-ups
do bicep curls they're like what the
fuck they suck at it they never trained
it weight lifters never trained myself
minus uh minus anthony pompino with
those fucking guns easter shit but
the thing is he came from a bodybuilding
background too right so so that's the
thing is like
don't don't get caught up in that
unbalanced stuff it's almost never going
to be a thing
yeah and it's actually funny that you
brought up a powerlifting thing because
you can actually make a very strong cost
benefit analysis of how much for
powerlifting and weightlifting are
weight class sports so the question is
like
per your weight class how much muscle
mass do you want to be carrying in
muscles that don't really have a direct
impact on your ability to execute the
movements that you're doing
so that might actually push you up into
a weight class where you're less
competitive
and that sounds silly like what are you
talking about but if you're carrying
around a whole bunch of extra mass in
your arms and your back is
a fucking huge amount of area you could
actually be putting on a substantial
amount of poundage there
which is not really contributing to your
powerlifting or weightlifting to a huge
degree
and might take you out of being
competitive somewhere else so there's
it sounds silly but there's a there is a
very strong cost-benefit analysis that
you could do there
yeah you want enough you want enough of
that to keep you
healthy and able to continue training
but
not so much that you're like seeing huge
progressions so this we're talking about
kind of like
maybe mev at some times of the year and
then mv the rest of the time
totally yeah great great way to put it
uh and it says epic bro bonus questions
seeing as guerrillas for some reason
choose not to lift
uh how jack do you think they could get
if they did surely gorillas aren't at
their genetic potential you know so
there's just one pure awful hypothesis
which is what we should just call this
webinar
pure awful hypotheses with mike and
james
i think that if you did two things that
i think is only ethical to do
with guerrillas we're not going to say
two that's politically correct do you
mean like real gorillas are just like
people it's really jealous
you fucking asshole um
it's tough to say that and not be
embarrassed so um
actual gorillas i think as a society
we owe gorillas at least two things one
teaching them to get into high volume
resistance training
and two pumping up at least a few of
them
with the most moonshot levels of gear
like
apollo space program type leveling gear
like right now
the level of gear gorillas are taking
can be described as zero
or like that stupid radio flyer movie
where they try to get the thing to
actually fly
i'm talking about saturn five type of
shit like the and they gotta get booster
and russia pivot shit
i'm talking about all the lifting all
the gear i don't care if the gorillas
are mean they're mean to begin
with more true yeah yeah but
is that guerrilla on trend or is it just
a gorilla right but if he's on trend we
get at least the gorilla that's so
muscular it inconveniences the gorilla
and to actually answer your question i
think they would get way more jacked and
it would be out of context of anything
you've ever seen a human being
you think humans have an an adaptation
to lifting
most primal fucking animals all the
pathways and shit are fucking more
robust
we're nothing uh gorilla would oh my god
gmo it's a thing probably way like
six i 600 pounds i would say no problem
completely lean
would be a totally accomplishment the
only thing only people
keeping us from this is ethics
committees that run zoos and preserves
i think these people are not ethical
they're keeping gorillas from their
natural potent
artificial potential and i think it's
travesty james
i could not think of one joke that i
could say on this
webinar so i'm gonna have to
respectfully move on from the gorilla
because i'm going to slip and make a bad
move or new jersey
literally i was like shut up james
yep yep i couldn't think of one one
okay one that's how bad this is i
thought of plenty no but seriously folks
sign the petition let's get those zoos
let's get these zoos to feed the
guerrillas tons of drugs and make them
resistance train
for our benefit and really the gorillas
benefit because after a while if they
teach from sign language
he'd be like do you like to be jacked
and he's going to be like fuck yeah bro
we did it we fucking did it all right
bananas for days
yeah you'd have to give him more protein
it'll be a whole thing bulgarian gorilla
training
jacob extracts protein out of plants
but they eat a lot of fucking plants bro
they eat like 30 pounds of plants per
day
so they extract marginally better but
they just make up for
volume gorilla bodybuilding would be a
trip because you're like dude you got
something masked you got a big gut
like we gotta have to sharpen that up
bro you can't be walking around with
that thing distended you teach them how
to do it
we gotta carve you up for peak week but
you gotta get rid of them bananas
what what a terrible terrible feat of
nothing
um all right we're gonna shave you down
yeah no yeah absolutely they have to be
shaved i don't know i
volunteer for that job you have to train
come to shave them right
like yeah yeah all right let's get out
of this gorilla as i
keeps it never ends never ends like a
hypertrophy of the gorilla would never
end
jacob kowalski asks how do you how would
you write a program oh sorry how would
you program for someone
who has a goal of doing 50 strict
pull-ups without taking rest between
reps so this is quite a complex question
it really depends on how far away they
are from their goal
uh i'll give you the grand tour and then
james will sharpen it up
uh if you're really really super far off
you want to establish the
gnarliest pulling musculature you can so
your goal is just going to get fucking
huge using a lot of pull-ups a lot of
weighted pull-ups
in the normal ranges the 10 to 20 rep
range like if you can in the 10-20 rep
range do pull-ups with 50 pounds hanging
you're well on your way right here and
also you would train legs
never and train your pushing complex
never you just have the gnarliest back
biceps and forms you could ever fucking
have
okay tons of rear delt work tons of lat
work tons of rowing tons of pulling
mostly vertical etc
once you were sufficiently large where
your back was fucking huge your lats
were enormous and you were doing like
you know
sets of 20 with a 50 pound weight
hanging then the next phase of training
would incrementally and you would
alternate these two phases work on
getting you into those higher rep ranges
to work on cadence the metabolic
adaptations
and actually practice sets of 30.
practice that's a 35 practice that's a
40
sometimes with a little bit of added
weight uh maybe sometimes with a little
bit of weight reduced like in an
assisted pull-up or you do a set of 60
just to get the feel of that and get
some of the metabolism
to sort of approach it like up and down
up and down up and down and then
eventually converge
on uh reducing volume
peaking and trying a set of 50. uh tough
what i would say the better way to do
all this the same structure but
try like 25 first whatever your best
is just try to move that up a little bit
over time same approach
but like 50 like it's difficult to
answer this because
jacob we could give you a much better
answer if you were like my best is 47
but i haven't been able to break it
james and i could fucking break it down
for you in a couple of months you'd
almost certainly hit it
but if if you're like at 10 motherfucker
you just need like a back that's two
times the size there's no other way
to do it james yeah that was a really
good like
training periodization for that the the
biggest deal breaker for me on this one
is just
literally a matter of strength to body
weight ratio it doesn't matter
anything like if you are too heavy you
will never get to 50 reps it's just one
of those things where you have to
maximize your pull your vertical pulling
musculature relative to your body weight
and that just means like you don't train
anything else you just let that all go
to shit and if you're somebody like me
like
if i stopped lifting i would still weigh
185 pounds that's just never gonna
happen
like i have it's just you're too heavy
right it doesn't matter so you
like kind of like mike said if your best
is like 25
and you are like 175 pounds i might be
like dude that's already
like insane right from like when you
look at average populations
like you would have to be like a hundred
and five pounds
almost nobody could do it like oh yeah
50. i don't yeah i don't know who can
exactly so like in the if you if i was
to imagine someone who could do 50
pull-ups
they would be like 105-pound male who
did gymnastics his whole life and
has a huge fucking pop-eye forearms huge
biceps and a lat spread
that would put me to shame which isn't
really hard but you know what i'm saying
um so
i'm just i'm just trying to say it a
nice way like check your expectations a
little bit where are you right like if
you can do 20
strict pull-ups like no grip assist no
kip
chin above the bar maybe even a chest
like you're the fucking
yeah exactly you're the man or the woman
or whomever whatever
you're you're already awesome 50 is like
when somebody says i can do 50 pull-ups
usually i'm like
sure right whatever you used to bench
1000 pounds in high school too right
all that um i'd be very skeptical so
anyways but
mike's answer on the periodization was
really good my suggestion would be you
have to find
your best strength to body weight ratio
for that particular
movement otherwise it's all the training
in the world's not going to make a
difference like that
this is just a guess don't quote me on
this but like if you weigh over 160
pounds
i just don't i can't imagine that
happening unless you're like a huge
outlier
i agree lastly
ali al
mohmin asked a great question
hi docs first i truly appreciate your
wonderful work so thank you
thank you so much thank you second i've
researched progressive overload to
understand its underlying mechanism and
proper application it seems that there
are two similar but distinct definition
definitions around the evidence-based
community one the active definition
where the person intentionally makes
every workout harder to generate a
stimulus while staying within their
capacity
that will later result in adaptation and
two the reactive definition where the
person observes an increase in their
capacity
slash adaptation to their previous
stimulus which then requires them
to make one workout harder uh in order
to keep up with the sad adaptation which
is more accurate i realize
that in the long term both end up with
just making the workout harder over time
but in the short term the two concepts
will likely demand
very different rates of difficulty
increases so i actually have a very good
answer for you here that's a great
question
yeah we'll see if james has uh any
critiques on my answer i think it's
stupid or i'm stupid and i'm a bad
person
it's usually the kind of stuff he says
so
it's not just that the answer was wrong
it's i think you're morally inept
and terrible you don't have to die just
leave
everyone alone forever
i don't want to kill her i just don't
want her to live anymore exactly
geez all right so
here's the deal the reactive definition
is the more technically correct one in a
grand scale
there overload is what is in the realm
of challenge
and over time if something dips out of
that realm then it's no longer
challenging and then you have to
upregulate to keep going
that's answer one so that's the bigger
more accurate definition
however in the heat of the moment
microcycle to microcycle progressions
especially when you're very fatigued
especially
when the lifts are very challenging
especially this real world human
psychological component
towards the end of accumulation phase
for example you may not
think that you can do something but if
it's a planned
increase you will yourself to do it it
turns out you could
you could be shitting away amazing
workouts and potential progression
by doing three rar in one week two where
i are in another week
you say to yourself one rir but let's
say you'll auto regulate everything so
it doesn't
matter to you how many reps you did last
time you're like just wondering but then
a reproduction occurs
because you just hack squatting sucks
and you don't want to do 20 reps and you
feel like okay i hit 10r at 18.
but in reality it was 3rir and then the
next workout is 5r because you're really
tired
to the muscles 5r which means that last
workout of the mesocycle even though you
feel
tired and you feel like fatigue is
accumulated wasn't actually
within the overall range on a technical
definition now
the way james and i like to train is we
start at a baseline when we're fresh
of definitely three rir at some decent
amount of volume
and then we say we're gonna move up five
pounds or two and a half pounds every
time or
rep every time as long as we're able to
get that performance we try to beat it
we try to beat it by just a little
that way we know we're never regressing
and psychologically it's not if i feel
like i
hit a pr i do psychologically i must hit
this pr
and if using everything i can i still
don't then i'm for sure overreached
then i deload i wash out i repeat i come
back
so in a short term i really we really do
advocate using that feed forward system
of progression
to make sure you're not fucking
bullshitting yourself right and in the
grand scheme
the auto regulation will take care of
everything to make sure that you're
doing a good job james
yeah that was really good so ali this is
kind of uh we
a similar topic basically ties into this
is the idea of having like pre-planned
periodization strategies versus
auto-regulated strategies
and ultimately especially for physique
training auto regulation is kind of the
the big bread and butter thing that
we're doing
but doesn't mean that we have to exclude
pre-planned strategies either and so if
you actually read recovering from
training
one of the things that we advocate for
is having some pre-planned strategies
because
you've trained for a little while you
have a reasonable expectation of how
it's going to go because you've done it
more than a few times
and then kind of having that either
written out or
mapped out in your mind or both and then
auto-regulating from there and for the
most part
once you've done this more than a few
times you find that your auto-regulation
and pre-planned
tend to meld pretty well together
outside of a few deviations here or
there
but the the the reason why you want to
do that is because
you have a built-in feedback and feed
forward mechanism with your training the
auto regulation
it helps with the feedback meaning
something comes up and you adjust to
whatever comes up to get the best
out of the situation and you have a feed
forward that says something came up i
need to adjust my training next time
because my pre
plant wasn't quite spot on and i need to
make sure it's more spot on next time
so we say like kind of use both you
don't have to think of it so rigidly as
like okay which is the most
perfectly correct it's like well they're
both kind of correct in their own ways
maybe one is has a little bit more
weight than the other but it doesn't
mean you have to exclude the other
use both they're both very helpful for a
variety of reasons
i have a a stupid analogy for how you
can see this
um imagine the overload threshold
from three rir all the way to zero r
and from mev all the way to mrv as
uh walking from one facility
uh on a base in antarctica to another
that's like 500 feet away you got your
snow shoes on and your fucking big coat
when you start walking
at 3rir 3rs when you start walking
the there's a bit of a storm but you can
see the other shed okay it's got a light
on it you can see it no problem
as you go from 3r or 2r10 if the shed
almost completely disappears and the
snow's like
right so the question of what's
pre-planned is
uh auto-regulated is can you see the
light walk to the light
duh right pre-planned is you got a
fucking map that says walk this way
exactly
okay because it gets real tough to see
that fucking lighthouse
you might veer off course now the thing
is there's no trouble
the antarctic analogy is a bit harsh
because you'll fucking die in a snowbank
if you hear
of course no one will find you our bear
shows up
right in antarctica they don't have
they have beers anyway if a bear shows
up you're really in deep shit how the
fuck did it get here i don't know why is
it trying to kill me
bear we're just fighting and talk to go
together we're on the same side of this
so um or you could like uh uh
luke skywalker's ass fucking cut him cut
inside and just fucking go in the bear
what's that uh i thought that smelled
bad on the outside
right so uh james you're a real bantha
fodder for that comment
oh blah blah blah blah ben
so so basically that's kind of the
analogy right like yeah no
you know where you're headed but in the
thick of things you don't know if you're
misstepping or not
so challenge yourself incrementally to
make sure you're on that path
and then performance and overreaching
will let you know when you've reached
the top end
plain and simple yeah that was a good
question i like that one
that's it and i have to go to jiu jitsu
to get choked oh
tonight we're doing you sure
all right well that was a fun one for it
was fun for me i hope you guys had fun
it was great having you guys with us we
enjoy
the questions we had some spicy ones
this week a couple people are getting
their name raised a couple times so
kudos to you guys really good questions
um that's it for me dr mike is there
anything going on that people need to
know about
nope for the time being we're just
putting out tons of youtube stuff
and uh good things on the way the
hypertrophy book is getting wrapped up
and editing so it's going to be out in a
few months
uh get excited it'll be real
all right folks from me and my new
friend
pig hope you have a great week enjoy and
we'll see you next time
