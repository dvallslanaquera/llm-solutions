hey folks

number five for strength training made
simple
how long should you rest between your
strength
training sets well it turns out we have
a pretty simple
four-step checklist formula that if you
check
every single one of these boxes you're
ready to go now you can always rest a
little longer after you've checked the
boxes
but as soon as you've checked the boxes
you're cleared before you've checked the
boxes
not a good idea to go just yet the next
set you do will not be of as higher
quality as it could have been
so here are the boxes box number one
your prime movers meaning like if you're
bench pressing that's your chest
front delts and triceps if you're
squatting it's your quads
glutes so on and so forth the muscles
that really make the movement go
if they're no longer burning or crampy
or feel drained
you can check that box that doesn't mean
you're ready to go yet but if they are
feeling crampy burner draining if
someone's like all right next set of
squats and your quads are still cramped
up
and burning do not go yet number two
your cardio will not limit you on your
next set so if you finish a set of
deadlifts in the rest three minutes
and your training partner's like what do
you think set number two and you're like
yeah i'm right uh uh hold on
definitely hold on okay your breathing
should not be 100 normal but return to
pretty much normal
where you're not having a huge what's
called tidal volume your lungs aren't
going up and down like this if you're
breathing
then you're good to go because your
cardio probably won't limit you on your
next set then
if you start your set of say three to
six reps
before your breathing is returned to
normal you risk the problem of like
you're on set uh rep number five
and it's not that you don't have the
driving strength to hit it
it's that on the way down you're like
and you start running out of air your
cardio is limiting you we're not there
to train your cardiovascular system
we're there to train your muscle
strength
which has to mean that it's the limiting
factor not cardio stopping you way too
soon point number three your nervous
system
psychology doesn't limit you
on the next set okay what does that mean
that means
it's tough to measure these things but
sort of colloquially
in ecological real time it means
that you feel strong again okay if you
just hit
a big set of four in the bench press and
rack the bar
ten seconds later someone could be like
do you feel strong no if it was a big
set of four like
i feel drained like everything's gone
yeah you wanna shrivel up and die in the
corner
but after a few minutes you get that
oomph back you know what i'm talking
about like you're like you know i can
push some weight i can push some weight
specifically because you're probably
been training for strength for a little
while
you kind of know yourself and you know
how
oomph that feeling has to be for you to
know you're going to hit that next set
so let's say the last set of five was
pretty tough not too tough
how strong do you have to feel to know
you're going to get the next planned set
of five if you
question it don't do it yet rest longer
so if you're kind of like i feel pretty
strong
i don't know if i'm five reps strong yet
at this weight i have planned
hold up rest another 30 seconds rest
another minute the longer you rest
there's not much downside there just
taking a little bit more time in the gym
rest it up and then after a minute
you're like all right no i'm for sure
ready right so there's no point in
rushing with this feeling of strength
okay lastly there are no synergist
muscles
the ones that help out that are going to
limit your next set so for example if
your quads feel
really great after a set of squats but
your lower back is still tight
or your lower back is still burning or
still tired don't go yet because then
your lower back will be the limiting
factor and it won't allow you
to train your legs for strength which is
one big purpose of the squat and it'll
turn the squat mostly
into a lower back movement a huge
take-home message here
is if you think you need a little bit
more rest take it
there's no real downside to taking a
little bit more rest
you're just going to have a higher
quality next that and next to the next
i'll tell you this
hypertrophy training is about quality
but a lot of it's about smashing in that
stimulus
strength training is nearly all about
quality
you got to get tons of force production
you got to be pretty close to at your
best
for every working set if that means
resting an extra 30 seconds
versus resting not 30 seconds enough
having a high quality set that cost you
an extra 30 seconds rest
versus a lower quality set that you're
like you know i should have gone five i
got four my technique broke down because
i was too tired
it's not worth it so airing on the side
of more is always good
so just two really quick examples here
of how this might look
let's say you're doing sets of five with
500 pounds and your max is 585
six plates it's a pretty tough set of a
really really
tough exercise so number one your prime
movers are no longer burning crampy or
drained let's say after about 60 seconds
it makes sense after 60 seconds your
quads feel fine
after about two minutes your cardio is
not limiting you so
you know one minute in after that set of
five
yeah still still breathing pretty heavy
after two minutes hypothetically some of
us it might take five
after two minutes you feeling pretty
good cardio wise and you're ready to go
now your nervous system on psychology
like a set of five or five hundred when
your max is 585 that's a
big big set it might take you five
minutes there's nothing wrong with that
to feel like you're really strong again
or ready to do another set of something
like five reps so that's five minutes
and notice it's in bold
because that's our limiting factor it's
the longest rest interval we have there
and lastly no synergists will limit you
well you know synergists tend to recover
about as fast as prime movers so after
60 seconds those are good
but that doesn't really matter so in
that case how long do you rest well it's
the longest of all of these four
checklist times which is to say
five minutes so your synergists are good
your prime movers are good your cardio
is good way before
your psychological strength comes back
you feel great and then everything else
is checklisted and then that's your
fourth checklist
you go in and at five minutes and no
sooner
you're ready to hit it again now can you
rest five minutes to 30 seconds six
minutes
six plus totally just don't rest so long
you know
ten minutes or more that you actually
feel cold and your psychology for
uh strength is actually declined you're
like oh my god i've waited too long i
need to re-warm up
definitely don't do that but that's like
minutes and minutes minutes later you
should have a real
easy middle ground there we've
definitely passed that five minute
threshold or whatever it takes
and then not rested too long to get cold
last example really quick
of a much easier lift because not all
strength training is maximal let's say
you are a 585 pound squatter same
squatter but it sets a five or 350
pounds in the squat
this is like technique and recovery work
so prime movers are no longer burning
after about 45 seconds
your cardio will not limit you on the
next set after only about a minute and a
half that's all it takes it's really not
that hard of lift
60 seconds for your nervous system
psychology to come back for the love of
god it was 350 pounds for five you could
do 585 for single it's not remotely near
your 1rm
not that hard and no center just limit
you after 45. the longest of those is
cardio
uh so basically after you stop breathing
heavy during recovery work
one and a half minutes later look that's
so different than five minutes
but you're ready to go and here's the
last fundamental take-home point
notice in the same person with the same
lift just different loading
never mind the different lifts we have
two radically different rest times so
anyone that says hey
you should rest two minutes for strength
and one minute of hypertrophy
is at the end of the day that has some
silver lining to that good advice
but really it's not the greatest advice
rest as long as
you need to have a quality set
performance according to score
checklists
and you'll be well on your way folks see
you next time for the next video
