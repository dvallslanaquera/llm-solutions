hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization as always
here with ethan simply actor
thespian
uh modern-day
superman really renaissance man
and of course none the one the only
big ass arms heaven jared feather
folks today we're gonna do something a
little bit differently jared feather is
actually coaching ethan
as his body composition coach
he's got to fly lies are scary i never
know what kind of insect it is and i
always like default to be
so jared is ethan's body composition
coach he's trying to get ethan as jacked
and lean as possible he does his diet he
does his training and an interesting
thing came up as ethan is kind of
gearing up for a final fat loss
mesocycle here pretty high fatigue state
he's coming off some active rest deload
kind of situation
and
this is a really good opportunity for us
to get the fuck out of my face fly
this is a really good opportunity for us
to talk through a little bit about how
to start a meza cycle because a bunch of
our videos are fun but they're end of
mesocycle videos and you explicitly say
like this is how you train the last
because it's hard it's super tough you
get to push it charlie throws up ethan
dies
but today ethan's reborn we're gonna
talk you through and jared is gonna take
the lead on this one talk you through
how jared expert super science coach
works with one of his best clients as
far as getting the job done exactly how
you're supposed to on how to start a
week of training start a month of
training make sure you're easing in
picking the movements correctly and not
killing yourself right off the front end
folks i've blabbed way more than enough
jared feather take us away awesome yeah
so as you mentioned most of the videos
that you've seen are us kind of just
messing people up really bad and i've
been getting a lot of questions about
that too like how come every single
session you guys do is super hard and
i'm just like uh they're really not i
think you're just kind of making
conjecture off of these videos but what
we're doing ethan today as he mentioned
we are coming off of a deload slash
ethan was traveling a little bit so he
uh
just kind of it was more of an active
rest kind of a two week period of
maintenance where we i was like hey
don't worry about it you're traveling
maintain your body weight and then we'll
get to heart training again later so
we're moving into about the this will be
the week 10 through 15 mark of dieting
down which is about as much as i'm going
to push ethan until he reaches his total
fat loss goal so by the end of this mesa
cycle he's going to be at the very end
of the fat loss phase and we're going
gonna be good to go but easing in for
this messa cycle we're gonna be starting
at about three reps in reserve uh the
sets are gonna be
slightly higher than last mesocycle
since we are hypocaloric so if we
started at like let's say six sets for
body part last time it's about seven or
eight steps for body part this time plus
there's some intensity techniques added
in stuff like giant sets you're gonna
see today i think there's a superset
thrown into the session it's all mapped
out already i sent it to him last week
he's ready to go he's very very anxious
to get started with training since he's
been kind of off for two weeks
um
we're gonna modify a couple exercises
since we're in a gym that doesn't really
have too many machines smith bench is
gonna be stuff for flat bench which will
be the first exercise it'll be about two
or three sets again three reps in the
tank we're gonna move to some uh
dumbbell flat bench that'll be an
intensity technique which you get to see
we can explain that later and uh we're
not gonna murder him today it's gonna be
more of a
intro week to day don't you celebrate
you guys exhausted yourselves on bart
quan yesterday i feel very sick bart's
dead the bar is gone yeah
[Music]
i'll let you know when to rack it
you let me yes because i don't know what
three reps in the reserve really looks
like
claws at the bottom let's go
there you go two
three breathe in
breathe out
breathe in
breathe out great keep going
six there you go
seven yeah one more
perfect
excellent
that's great three and reserve right
there there you go
jared and i
the way we train at charlie is we
probably start
a meza cycle less intensely than most
people think
and we end it more intensely than more
people think
because we love that ease in and that
that slow ride up yeah like our whole
training philosophy is start with what
you're really just easily capable of
doing that's a challenge and stimulative
it'll get you sore you'll get a pump
from it and then you just every week add
a little bit of weight to the bar add a
rep if the volume indicators say you add
a set or take one away and then towards
the end we're doing usually a lot more
volume sometimes just a little more but
almost every set is super close to
failure or the failure and you know it's
the entire time you get high quality
training because people have this debate
about um
you know should you train really really
really hard
like be a hardcore fucking warrior or
should you train really really easy easy
just to get the easy gains but you're a
fucking pussy we say yes to both
and then also to the middle ground so we
just work from one to the other dealer
to repeat
right i can't refute that as a good
practice yeah yeah like you said earlier
you've been enjoying
easing into the higher quality i fucking
love it and i will say before when i was
trying to do
progressive overload on my own
which i was doing
certainly
i i don't think i i think i was middling
it too much on both ends i wasn't
starting low enough and i wasn't working
a lot of people do that so i was like my
window
was smaller
and this way by the time we're done
because we've done a bunch of cycles of
this
i am fucking fatigued yep but but also
when you start you get the great easy
injury
free gains but you don't have to push
yourself super early you know
um i think i think there's two really
big reasons
why people usually middle ground it
reason one is they don't want to sort of
pussy out on the front end they're like
man this is broken because you know
you're deloaded right and then you're
like fucking i want to go yeah and then
when you were through text all week it's
like i'm fucking ready to train
it's fucking the worst for sure of the
whole things yep yeah but then after
deload you go too hard and then as you
build from there
two or three weeks out from your peak
you're like man add a rep and a set and
some weight fuck that that shit is hard
so it requires like a real presence to
know to just be patient to start early
and then turn the shit up like you never
thought possible towards the end yeah
and it's tough but at the end of the day
i think training is like
something you have to do well not
something that your instincts
necessarily drive you to do well you
know it's just something that has to be
done on uh about willpower willpower but
intent you know like i'm here to do a
specific thing sometimes i won't really
love that thing but it's the right thing
[Music]
so again we talked about the intensity
techniques that we're going to add into
this mesocycle one of those that we
include oftentimes is called a giant set
so we've been dieting for about 10 weeks
by the end of this mesocycle it's gonna
be pretty glycogen depleted very
fatigued from that long hypocaloric
period what giant sets allow you to do
is to get a rep achievement
you do the same normal rest through the
set um you just take as many sets as you
need to get the rep achievement so if he
does 60 reps this week with the weight
get a 70 next week it doesn't matter if
he rep matches and because the glycogen
is going to be coming down pumps are
going to be fading he's probably not
going to rep match each set individually
but since the total reps are going up
it's going to make the volume increase
that way so it's a really good kind of
like the my rep set you see us do the
supersets again and the giant sets these
are really good things to add in so that
way you can get effective refs still and
you are able to increase the volume load
over time during that very end of the
hypocaloric period maybe even toward the
end of massing phases
six good
seven
oh yeah
32 you're at 30. nice slow eccentric
good
[Music]
that's it
perfect
i feel very
uh
blessed whatever fucking
bless hashtag
blessed to have the opportunity to like
train with you guys
jared has truly truly changed my
training
but i know like prior to that a lot of
my information did come from the
internet and it was a lot of just like
watching people and what they did
and
a lot of dudes are doing
what looks to be incomplete yeah partial
reps with super heavy weights so that's
an interesting question because
a lot of people who are called hashtag
science based we'll see those those guys
are idiots and they're doing it all
wrong it's not all wrong
the primary driver of hypertrophy is
tension and you can apply a shit load of
tension that way
the thing is
if they did do full range of motion they
would get maybe like five percent better
hypertrophy because they would be
targeting yeah so they'd be targeting
more of the muscle fiber and some of the
parts of the fiber don't activate fully
when you just do this range so you get a
little bit better hypertrophy you think
okay so it's just a little difference
however first of all the systemic
fatigue would be way lower so they could
increase the length of their mesocycles
or increase the number of
amount of load or sets that they had and
that would give them even another maybe
five percent extra hypertrophy over the
long run not the short run and here's
the real big kick decrease
like
career span injuries yes and connected
to your advantage
what you see with the guys on instagram
that are amazing and jacked is an
example of something in statistics
called survivorship bias or survivor
bias you only see the guys that succeed
you remember that one guy who was going
to be big in taurus quads of course you
don't remember that guy
because nobody fucking does i i know
some of them because they work up and
coming yeah and then they hurt
themselves right there's a known guy i
keep his name out of it who tore both
his quads on the hack squat doing like a
double on a hack so the fuck does it
double
instead of two super close to
competition because that's when all the
drugs hit you feel really like superman
but your joints and connective tissues
are like
super dehydrated so he tore both his
quads it's just never the same again
it's still a phenomenal bodybuilder but
i'll ever be but he could have been so
much more if he just didn't do that the
thing is those guys on instagram that
are super human and amazing you see them
in and you know look if they stop
posting because they get hurt they're
out of the algorithm you never see them
again they're out of the filter so then
new guys come in that are still not hurt
it's like uh it's like if if this is a
super crude analogy but if it's like
like gladiators from roman times had
instagrams like they don't post when
they're dead see like these gladiators
have all of it figured out they're
immortal because the only guys on
instagram never die
so it's that sort of thing so as a
lifter and the way jared and i look at
it is looking forward like i'm a guy
who's just getting into training or just
trying to do right
looking forward at the problem of i
survivorship bias i can't afford because
there's only one of me what do i do to
enhance my results a little bit but
enhance my longevity a lot and that is
full range of motion training can you
get away with doing the bullshit maybe i
don't want to put my money on maybe i
want to put my money on the highest
probability does that make sense so what
they're doing is it's not wrong but it's
not wise in the long term and most of
like the older bodybuilders
they're watching the guys who are
slightly younger than than them be like
i wish i'd known this stuff back in my
early 20s and 30s people like dexter
jackson are looking at those guys like
well yeah i've been doing that the
entire time that's why he's 50 years old
on stage and he's like placing third of
the olympian shit still yeah he's been
doing this stuff like how we've been
doing it just machine full range of
motion like utilize you know intensity
techniques closer to shows things like
that never doing crazy shit yeah no
super heavy loads and things like that
if you don't need to especially close
the contest sure so those guys are
probably the guys that i would look more
tuned to right but they're not exciting
dr johnson's instagram videos are like
he's doing this and you're like okay
he's great looking but he's not fired up
like crazy he's not yelling at 800
pounds
he's still in one piece
[Music]
all right guys
jared had to go use the restroom so i'll
intro this exercise
ethan has three sets of push-ups with a
close grip
but it's only 30 seconds break between
which really drives the metabolites
it allows you
to have to do a little bit less volume
which would typically be less growth but
the extra drive of metabolites given
that it's after we've done a lot of our
compound heavy loading stuff
can be a benefit in the context of a
total program so
30 seconds rest and for ethan 30 seconds
means his lungs really aren't a limiting
factor his central nervous system really
isn't his local musculature is because
it's already pre-fatigued at this point
so let's get into it
[Music]
one more one more
good
that was great
12
good stuff
i'll let you know when to go again
[Music]
one more
good stuff
good
see how you feel at four
[Music]
good done stuff good stuff man
nice
that's it
that was hard
so we're doing a mile rep set of push
downs just one set here basically it's
going to allow us to push relatively
close to failure a couple times in a
single set
he's going to perform 15 to 20 on the
first going
3 two rar then he's gonna take a very
brief pause
do a couple more back to three rar and
we're gonna do that twice so it's gonna
be three mile reps in the single set
working good stuff
control that last part of the ecenter
too
there you go
[Music]
shake it off
ready
go
four six more
big chest up
there you go
good stuff
yep
last one here
good
right check it out again another three
to five go ahead
[Music]
shoot control eccentric
last one
good stuff good stuff
awesome
how i feel
that was hard
next exercise for ethan is going to be
dumbbell curls ethan has had some elbow
issues in the past we were curling sort
of more behind the body because it was
very comfortable for him um
these curls seem to be okay for him so
we're going to be doing pretty strict
dumbbell curls out in front the weight's
not too heavy and the weight usually is
the issue for ethan so he's really
strict curls holding the outside of the
dumbbells rep range is going to be
anywhere from 15 to 20.
let's see if you can gauge three rar
this time
this is textbook technique ethan amazing
is that four
but
can't count
stay upright
step right right
good
let's go let's go one more
there you go
nice good stuff it's that you got big
ass arms yeah you really do man
i don't agree with you it's like shit
standing that's okay i'm the expert
there you have it that was a uh week one
of the mesocycle style of training
session that uh so that's kind of how
yours might look that's how ethan
specifically looked uh you saw we did
mostly push a little bit of
triceps and then a little bit of biceps
ethan trains roughly four to five times
a week so we sprinkle in biceps lateral
delts things like that three to four
times a week as far as the frequency
goes but uh relatively moderate rar so
three in the tank each set and then
a couple sets per exercise really
good stuff that was awesome
