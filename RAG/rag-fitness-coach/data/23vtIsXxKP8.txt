[Music]
one more
[Music]
i said six months is it four to six i
said six
[Music]
yes hey what's up camera
forearms what you doing for farms uh the
uh
dumbbell code yeah oh that uh yeah yeah
yeah
i figured a way out so today we have
uh quick forearms uh then
some lying leg curls and then finish off
with some
heavy-ish hex squats so
uh yeah they should be fun it's one of
my favorite days
leg day is always great
[Music]
so i throw in forearms at the beginning
of a lot of uh
like workouts because they don't
impede my leg workout at all and uh it's
a great place to throw them in if i do
them
during back day then either my forearm
my grip is fatigued for back or i do
back and then i don't feel good forearms
cause i'm tired already
this is a great way to kind of split up
training so i can get a good stimulus on
my forearms
and not have to worry about impacting
the rest of my training
jared is currently sleeping at home
being a lazy piece of shit you know he
don't he's not living this life this
is a warrior life in the battlefield on
the battlefield right
yeah the battlefield crush crushing it
and killing the weights
yeah iron brother he's not iron brother
he's iron bitch
so i'm uh 16 weeks into my diet
my prep and cheat meals
none um yeah i don't understand why
you'd have cheat meals
during your prep and to go beyond that i
haven't
gone over my targeted macros
or color intake one day yes
obviously i've been hungry here and
there you know that's just the
nature of being hypochloric but cravings
i've had exactly zero cravings
hunger and cravings uh
are separated at least in my own head
i'm hungry
and then i look at a food and most
people just go
oh man i wonder how that tastes i wonder
how that
you know feels in my mouth i wonder
what's going to feel like when they eat
it
but it's now i just i kind of figured i
look at the food
and don't go to that next step
[Music]
all right hamstring curls i know he says
he likes that one
but he's got all the weird levers and
shit what uh
it's intimidating i'm gonna try this one
see how it feels
[Music]
so for this prep the diet
has totally consisted of
two different days one a very deep
deficit
and the other a deficit but a lesser one
the first
few weeks we were with all lower deficit
days so
the lesser of a deficit and as time went
on we just
kind of shifted each week to look kind
of like a
five two four three three four
and then currently five two so five
higher deficit days and two
of the lower decimal days on the higher
deficit phase
we aim for a minimum of ten thousand
steps a day and on a lower deficit days
we aim for a minimum of eight thousand
steps a day
as time goes on as the prep goes on that
diet
fatigue does build so towards the end
you know
more hunger you know less energy we
knew that was gonna happen that's
expected but to be completely honest
i thought it was gonna be worse
quality charlie
i feel uh i mean i feel like when i read
about
most people's preps online like a week
or two three weeks out they're
always talking about i'm digging and
working you know head down all that
stuff like yeah
i'm working i'm doing all that stuff too
but i don't feel
bad whatsoever i feel pretty good
[Music]
yep
don't start until i think the thing that
really baffled me about charlie during
this prep
last time i saw him he was pretty lean
this time i saw him he was like
ridiculously lean but exactly the same
physical size
just leaner and more muscular
unbelievable transformation
and knowing how much we didn't push the
pace this
fat loss phase uh knowing how much more
we could push as far as
calories lower and cardio higher
especially how many low days we can do
uh it's very exciting what we'll be able
to do in future perhaps with charlie
three and you're done go high quality
one
all the way up strength go
good shot stuff man
good stuff i'm gonna set up a hack for
you charlie
thank you okay
i can walk wait okay
[Music]
to be honest it's kind of like trippy
with jared and i train with charlie
he's like the big sail on the ship like
we kind of follow him around
as far as training energy like you know
when you're showing up at charlie if you
want to go
effort for effort with charlie there's
no limit to that there's no cap to that
remember you're ready charlie that's uh
code mike's code for hurry the fuck up
and do yourself
