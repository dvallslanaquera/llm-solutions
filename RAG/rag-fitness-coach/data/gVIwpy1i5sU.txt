hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization the best time of the day
to train specifically with weights
specifically for hypertrophy but
strength is included and so is sport
practice so basically any heart training
what you want results
what time of the day is best train
especially for muscle gains
and for strength gains let's take a look
so because you guys signed up for all
the science here we're going to give you
a principled approach
there are some universal considerations
that can tailor your choice as to what
time of the day to train it's not a one
factor problem it's a multi-factorial
problem here's the deal
always a consideration is when you in
the day normally
feel psychologically like you have the
most energy
okay it's like if you wake up at five in
the morning because someone told you
that's the magical time to train and
you're like
uh and you get to the gym and you're
like uh you have a pre-workout you're
like uh what am i doing
maybe that's not the best time for you
and maybe ideally you don't want to
train at 7 pm for some reasons we'll get
to in a bit
but if you just feel god's fire and wind
in your fists when you're
at 7 pm you're just like oh i'm gonna
kill shit maybe you could train a little
later than normal and maybe 7 pm really
is your time
other factors do play a role with that
energy
you have sort of just your psychological
feeling of when you can produce the most
high quality work
that's important to consider next
consideration
is when you're able to get at least one
big meal after
you even let's say you feel god's wind
and energy
at 11 pm every night and then at 1 am
you get home and you're so tired you
just go straight to sleep
no meal that doesn't bode well for
strength adaptations it doesn't go well
with hypertrophy adaptations you want to
put the recovery process into motion you
don't want to starve yourself for 10
hours
right after training that's no bueno
don't do it so
at least when you're designing a
protocol let's say even if some of the
factors take you to really late night
training
or training that's like right before a
big work meeting the last six hours you
won't be able to eat
should have at least one solid food meal
right after okay
uh it doesn't have sorry not solid food
meal a solid meal of food
you it can be a liquid meal for sure it
just has to be a meaningful amount of
food
to really get the recovery and
adaptation processes going here's
another consideration very
related at a time which doesn't
interfere with sleep so if you had
unreal training energy at 11 pm
and then at one you go to sleep and
you're like
wide awake at three like still like
recovering from your workout and still
amped
bad bad news because you're interfering
with sleep on the other end
i you guys will relate to this uh
probably no matter where you're from in
the world
there's like a cultural expectation that
when you start fitness
you like wake up early to do shit i
don't know how it is everywhere else but
like in america there's this like lore
where it's like i'm gonna make some
fucking changes man like oh yeah is that
right again man january 1st
i'm going to start waking up at 4am to
run like fucking
why what is it that happens at 4am
that is so conducive to running i'll
answer this nothing okay but here's the
thing if you think you need to train
really early
and it interferes with your highest
quality sleep like real talk
my best sleep occurs between the hours
of 4 00 am and 7 am you could detonate a
fucking nuke next to my apartment
building i won't wake up between four
and seven
actually i won't wake up at all because
i'll be dead from the nuke but
in any case high quality sleep then i do
not mess with that
if someone's like hey you want to train
at 6am i'm like no god no hell would i
do that because sleep
is super anabolic sleep is super
recovery promoting sleep is super
prone to increasing fat loss rates you
don't mess with sleep
so whatever kind of training design you
want whatever time that you want to
train make sure it doesn't interfere
with the sleep or interferes with it as
little as possible lastly
big universal is when you don't feel
sick okay is it true that if you have
multiple meals before you go train
you'll have saw your glycogen stores
will be maxed out your blood glucose
will be maxed out
you're going to be recovered from
whatever you do the day before you're
going to be really ready to go yeah to a
certain extent that's absolutely true
versus let's say training with no food
you just wake up and go to the gym
yeah like one or two meals in is
probably a little bit more ideal on
average but here's the thing
if you get vomiting during your workouts
or sick if you've eaten recently
maybe that's not an option or maybe you
need to wait longer or something like
that so if someone tells you look you've
got a three solid food meals in
you gotta eat at 8 a.m 12 4
and then at five i want you to go train
you go out five you're like
after one set of squats it's not tenable
and someone could say like for example
me when i do most of my training
definitely my leg training
i almost always train legs on an empty
stomach and it doesn't mean i wake up
and
wait a whole while like i usually wake
up and within one hour probably less
i'm already training so i don't spend a
lot of time catabolic or anything like
that
but i don't even have a protein shake
nowadays before i train legs because it
is
just coming out if i have it and you
could say well like technically
dr mike wouldn't it be better if you had
some energy in your bloodstream some
glucose from a meal
i agree with you but because it would
make me sick it would disrupt the
quality of my workout also who the hell
likes throwing up yeah i post bullshit
on instagram to get the clicks and share
like look how tough i am but real like
nobody likes vomiting you know it's
gross
so you don't want that stuff you and if
it has to sacrifice
time of the day for training then then
maybe that has to come so people say
well why do you train first thing in the
morning for legs be like
if i train any other time i'm just going
to throw up whatever food i have
that's how it works so all of these
things should be taken into
consideration
right for the average person
if we take it for the average person
very important if we take all this into
consideration
what good recommendation can we start
you off with because i don't want to
give you guys a video
that's like hey like here's all the
considerations good luck right we're
going to give you a little bit more than
that
for the average person the
mid-morning is a really good time to
train now most people have day jobs they
can't train then but
high-level athletes a huge fraction of
them train mid-morning for a reason at
least the first session
you're one to two meals in so your
training energy is really high but you
aren't too full yet okay if you train
like after
four or three or four meals and you're
on a mass gaining plan holy crap you
know
just come right back out you want to
train something like one to three hours
after your last meal so that you don't
vomit but so that you still have plenty
of energy from it like if you train five
hours after your last meal you're like
basically just super hungry during
training but if you train one hour after
last meal or 30 minutes or something
then it just comes all the food just
comes right back up if it's hard
training so
in addition to that mid-morning is good
because
you have two to four meals left in the
day to really recover and grow the crap
out of you
so mid-morning is like my cluster just
first fire off like mike when should i
train i'm like mid-morning
and if you go butt i'm like last slide
go to the universals and do all the
butts you start there intellectually
okay mid-morning that's where you start
and then
we're going to bias it forward or
backward depending on the following
inputs first input is schedule like if
you can't
if you work that's out it's okay i can't
do mid-morning
i work from 7 a.m to 4 p.m good news now
you train at 4 30.
yeah we take the mid-morning we move it
up or you train it like i don't know 4am
that's kind of crazy
if that interferes with your sleep it's
off right we'll get to that in a sec
so if you uh you know wherever you start
if you can to your training partner
let's say
can't make it at 11 a.m but he can make
it at one pm
then you just move it to one because
it's not ideal or maybe for you
it's not that template that just stays
at mid-morning but it moves according to
your scheduled demands
next one is training intensity ability
so mid-morning on average is good but if
you really just fired up
early morning train earlier if you're
fired up later
bias your training time later to the
extent that it allows you to train
harder you say look okay
ideally i'm on fire at 5 00 pm but i
know it's not great because there's not
a ton of meals after that
i don't want to do 11 a.m hey training
partner let's try two or three pm and
he's gonna be like okay that sounds
great and it turns out you have plenty
of energy not your best
but also the you know the food stuff is
good and you get plenty of recovery
afterwards so it checks most of the
boxes right
next one is meal timing sometimes you
have pre-set meals you can only eat them
a certain time
like if you have breakfast always at 7am
you may not be able to train at 7 30. so
you have to consider that
move it along with meal timing sleep
quality and amount
like if someone if you really do have
your best workouts
early in the morning but you're also one
of these people that are like look if i
sleep in a little bit
it absolutely does wonders for my
recovery i can wake up i get my
pre-workout and have a baller session
but like i know i should be sleeping in
a little bit more i just want to
grab the day by the horns you know then
maybe yeah don't start at 11 p.m
but don't start at 4 a.m maybe start at
like 8 a.m or something like that
break the difference between the two
digestive comfort and this one i beat to
death already but look if you can't
if you'll be throwing up your food or if
you train
so late that you try to eat a bunch of
food right after in your digestive
discomfort while you're trying to fall
asleep you're like
uh i'm gonna throw up in my bed you guys
ever have your belly so full of food
that you can only lay on the side and if
you lay on your stomach you're like nope
that's coming right back out
like you don't want that situation so if
you say okay i would love to train at 11
00
p.m but i'm gonna train at nine pm
because then i can eat a meal right
after and i can be okay when i go back
to sleep
um another consideration potentially
these are a little bit more exotic but i
had to throw them in there
is training at a time you're going to be
competing so like if you typically train
at 6 00 p.m
but your powerlifting meets going to be
at 9 a.m or 10 a.m you might want a
couple sessions in the last couple weeks
at nine or 10 am ideally so you're used
to exhibiting
uh your best abilities at that time it's
psychologically and
physiologically changes will happen to
make you better at your sport
if you practice at that time in which
you're going to be competing and it's
pretty crazy but
a lot of you have been competitive
athletes before are currently you guys
know what i'm talking about like
if you compete at a very different time
than you train like if you always lift
at night
but then like it's like nine in the
morning and you're at the athletes
meeting and piloting me they're like all
right go to bars loaded in 30 minutes go
ahead and warm up and you're like
warm up this is usually when i sit at a
desk and type on a computer for the next
eight hours
and you you start warming up and look
like your muscles feel different in the
morning then at night
and you're like my knees what the hell's
going on so if you've never tried it
before
it can be pretty rough and if this is an
important competition it's maybe a good
idea
to get a little bit of experience like
that and
if you were training and competing in
the same weekend so like for example
weight lifters will do this some runners
will do it or they'll have training runs
like days or a day separated from
competition runs easier runs of course
easier weightlifting sessions but
nonetheless some separation
then you want to alter it from that so
for example if a weightlifting meet
on saturday you're probably going to be
doing some training on friday in most
cases weight lifters do some kind of at
least warm up and sometimes they go
relatively heavy even though there's a
bit of a potentiation effect
even on friday but like look it should
be earlier on friday let's say you
normally lift in the evening fine but
you don't want to lift friday evening
and still be sore and tired for saturday
morning
because no one's going to wait for you
in the competition it's not going to be
saturday night it's going to be saturday
morning
so yeah you have to train friday
normally you train in the evening
train in the morning it's going to suck
a little bit but then you're going to
have hours and hours and hours of
glycogen repletion
muscle recovery get a great a night of
sleep wake up saturday and you're gonna
be like all right i'm super ready to go
so that's another consideration here
now tldr i should have just like time
stamped this earlier if you just want to
fast forward to this not
we throw the bullshit in this video um
here is
the sort of breakdown in simple terms
the good news
is that if you have to train at a
certain new time per day
like let's say you're you get a new job
your training partner does or both move
to a new city and you're like i have to
train at 11 am now
fuck i'm a 4pm guy this sucks you will
get used to it your body's incredibly
flexible
and they've done multiple studies where
they should train here trained there
after a few weeks most people are like
this is great and sometimes you don't
get completely used to it but it's gonna
be much better
don't judge a training time by that
first day you ever tried that shock of
like
what the hell am i doing here give it a
couple more days
and by the end of the week you're
probably going to be like yeah 11 a.m is
fine i don't even remember what it was
like to train at four
right and in the end and here's the real
big one
don't sweat the training times too much
i know a lot of you folks
looking up this video are going to have
red other stuff or watch this stuff they
do deep dives into the literature
diurnal variations hormonal peaks
what's the real best time of the day to
train none of that stuff
matters that much you want to pick a
time that lets you train
hard you want to pick a time lets you
get a few meals in after to recover and
have plenty of energy before
you want to pick a time that doesn't
mess with your sleep
and that fits your schedule and that's
about it
give it some thought like comment
subscribe
pick five people from your email list
maybe grandma maybe your boss
forward them this video and say this one
video will change your life
and then they're going to be super
disappointed they're going to hate you
folks
see you next time
