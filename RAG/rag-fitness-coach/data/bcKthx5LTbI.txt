hey folks doctor mike isatel here for
renaissance periodization
today's talk is about getting motivated
to lose fat especially for the
dieting process which is a really big
deal
not just getting motivated but staying
motivated
here is the deal it turns out
that the term motivation actually
belongs in a much larger context
and that larger context of being able to
stick to something and have success with
it is actually called
adherence so when people say oh man like
i want to find a way to get motivated
and stay motivated to lose fat and
actually do the diet because dieting's
hard
what they're really saying is i want to
be able to find a way to be adherent to
find and keep
adherence adherence just being able to
do something
so motivation actually means something
more specific we'll get to what it means
in just a little bit
but adherence the ability to stick to a
plant is almost
everything why so any diet that cuts
calories
below your maintenance level will work
for fat loss
and any diet that also gives you a
reasonable meal schedule like it's not
one meal a day
and it gives you plenty of protein
enough to meet your daily needs for
muscle retention
is going to work very well not just well
so most diet successes don't come down
to the details people say
should i do the south beach diet should
i do the zone diet should i do this diet
that diet
the real answer that scientists usually
say is it doesn't really much matter
as long as you can adhere to it it just
doesn't suck on the fundamentals
and set you up for really crappy habits
that are unsustainable again hurting
adherence
so your success is usually determined in
huge part
by your ability to adhere to the diet
and let the diet work
so if it's keto if it's vegan if it's
paleo it's whatever
if you do it right and you're
hypocaloric at a deficit in calories
for eight weeks or 12 weeks you're gonna
be successful
but it doesn't matter how awesome your
diet is how scientific it is how
advanced it is
if you fall off the wagon often or even
at all
gee you're not going to see very good
success or no success at all
now let's take a look at this concept of
adherence
and see if we can zone in on it from a
scientific perspective to see how we can
boost it because adherence is basically
everything in dieting
there's got to be ways to be able to
make sure adherence is as high as
possible and turns out there are
so adherence can be broken up into
essentially
six constructs okay these constructs are
these
sub ideas of adherence factors that
build it and make it up
actually pretty much occur in phases
some of them start and sort of never
stop
some of them have distinct times when
they start and stop and some of them
only occur later in the process but
essentially
if you do like a 12-week diet you can
break up the diet
adherence into various parts of these
constructs
some of them occur earlier and then sort
of fade out some of them occur all the
time and some of them occur late
and by understanding each one of these
we can greatly greatly benefit
and making sure we do the right stuff at
every stage of the process
to keep our adherence to boost it as
high as possible
and keep it as high as possible and
potentially even let it climb
so that we can have as much success as
possible just like we want to make sure
we're doing the right diet that gives
our bodies what we need
we want to make sure our mindset is
correct to keep our minds what we need
because the end of the day
you know they say something like
whatever sports or whatever percent
mental dieting is all mental
gee you know that's not that wrong right
dieting
as long as you have the basics is mostly
all mental
and the basics aren't that complex so we
have six concepts of adherence they are
inspiration motivation intention
discipline habit and passion
and they're often misused often
misunderstood there's great stuff here
let's take a look at them one by one and
we're going to do essentially
three or four things we're going to talk
about what each one of them is we're
going to talk about what it's good for
we're going to talk about what it's not
good for because some folks try to
misapply these at the various stages of
various things
they're not very well applied for and
lastly and probably most importantly
we'll talk about how to boost
these various constructs to get the most
out of them so first up
inspiration inspiration is the spark
that gets you to want to start a diet
and it's good for getting you to start
if you never inspire to start
no amount of habit or passion or
anything is even possible
because you've never started now what is
inspiration not good for it's not good
for sustaining you
continuously in in your adherence for
longer than like
a day okay that's the thing about
inspiration
an example of inspiration is you see a
movie where someone loses a bunch of
weight
and gets in shape and gets the girl or
gets the guy or something
you leave the movie theater like pumped
like oh my god
i want to do a diet how long does that
feeling last well it's exactly how long
it lasts for most people
until they go to sleep that night and
then they wake up the next morning
and they're like diet
what the hell was i thinking you know
like everyone wants to be a boxer after
they see the recent rocky movie
but not exactly everyone goes out and
gets boxing gloves the next day you just
leave the theater doing this
and then a couple hours sometimes
minutes later it's just not a thing
anymore
right so if you're thinking that
inspiration is going to carry all the
way through a diet you're so so wrong
some people get into their inspiration
scrolling through instagram and looking
at cool transformations or people that
are super jacked or super lean and like
i want to be that
and it gives you that like instant bump
you can feel inspiration it's like
let's do it but that's the thing is like
if you don't have all the core concepts
in place
like building good habits for example
having discipline and willpower stuff
we'll talk about later
inspiration will never get you through a
diet because when you get hungry
and you actually have to be executing a
diet no instagram scroll is ever going
to save you
you're like i don't know these people
are lean but whatever fuck them i don't
care anymore i want to eat tacos and
then you just go eat tacos and you fall
off the face
so inspiration is good for getting us
started but it's not good for
sustainable sustainable adherence
for that we'll need the later concepts
so how do we boost inspiration because
we do want
plenty of inspiration at the back end a
lot of people once they get going
they're good to go
getting them going is the trouble so how
can we boost it well first you can be
around inspirational
people if you're on folks at your gym or
at work or whatever they're super pumped
and super ready to go and they're
succeeding themselves
it's easy to be like man i feel like i
can do this where if i let the negative
people they bring you down it's tough to
get inspired
right or if they never do anything
inspirational themselves sometimes
it's the sort of negative inspiration
that works really well
you see you have evidence of the not
great shape you're in here's a good
example
you like uh the elevator at work breaks
and you've been sort of meaning to diet
for a while loose fat but
whatever the elevator at work breaks and
you have to go for up four flights of
stairs
you walk into your office building you
go up four flights of stairs you get to
your work floor and you're like
and people are like hey bob how you
doing good morning hey dude you run up
the stairs what are you doing you're
like run i took three breaks walking up
the shit
i'm out of shape that inspires you
in a sort of negative way not to say
negative is bad isn't like the opposite
of like
positive inspiration that inspires you
to do something
you could sit down at your desk and
you're wiping sweat off and you're like
that's it
i'm logging on renaissance spiritization
and buying a you know membership to the
diet app or something like that
shameless plug
but on a serious note whatever it is you
end up doing you might be like i got to
do something about this now because this
is unsustainable another really common
one that you'll see
is people see a picture of themselves at
like the beach you know people are
taking pictures like hey hot dogs fun
and you see a picture of yourself at the
beach and you're like ah i'm the man
but like you really let yourself go with
us last year you take a look at your
first picture in the summer or something
you're like uh that's me like yeah isn't
it great we were having fun at the beach
last week and here's the pictures and
you're like
wow i look like shit and i don't want
this so that can be inspiring and it's
only
right so seeing stuff like that having
those experiences
is a big thing to boost inspiration and
seeing diet success stories can be
really inspirational another shameless
plug
if you go on rp transformations or the
rp strength instagram and you scroll
through there's a bunch of really
amazing transformations that regular
people have
and some of the most impressive ones
aren't like when super ripped athletes
get even more super ripped
but some like regular mom and dad kind
of people just get a little bit more
uh lean and a little bit healthier and
talk about how awesome they feel and
you're like dude i can
i can fucking do this i can do this
that's inspirational
that's all really good stuff to see so
if you want this for yourself
or you're helping clients or friends set
them up in these circumstances and
they're more likely to be inspired
now this next little graphic which you
have on your screen
is essentially like a sort of graphical
representation of these concepts and
it's super super easy to it's not super
scientific it's not super complicated we
just essentially having adherence on the
y-axis
and time on the x-axis inspiration
is this red thing that goes up so it's
basically showing us that inspiration
can boost your ability to adhere to
something for like well like a day
and then it just rockets back down to
nowhere
so inspiration is good to get us in the
door but it won't hold we need to move
on to the next concept
that'll be with us for longer and that
is
motivation again this whole con
this whole talk is usually described as
motivation it's not that's adherence
motivation is a specific part it's the
one that is essentially the inner desire
that you have
to want to diet and to sustain the
process of diet
motivation is goal directed and it is
very good for fueling your adherence day
to day
after inspiration has waned after you're
no longer inspired you don't have that
like oh i want to do this
motivation is that thing that pulls you
along in the distance that you're like
i got to do it i got to do i want this
and i know it has to be done
it's quieter it's not as extreme it
doesn't have as many ups and downs
but it does have ups and downs it waxes
and wanes
sometimes every hour sometimes every day
sometimes every week and it does this
and it thus can't be your only support
every single day it can be a start but
it waxes and wanes
and sometimes it dips pretty low
so if your adherence is like how good
you do on your diet
and your motivation goes like this
you're now doing this well on your diet
which could be very not well
so if you're really motivated one day
you could be eating all the right meals
doing all the right stuff check plus on
everything
if you're really demotivated for a
couple of days you could just be a taco
bell sitting around and drinking soda
out of their machines and eating the
taco stuff
you know just right off they're like
just let me in the back of the kitchen
i'm just going to eat tacos myself
then all of a sudden some good days of
dieting some crappy days of dieting
then your motivation goes back up you
have some good days but we all know how
calorie balance work
it all averages out you could just do
three weeks of dieting and go nowhere
motivation is not good enough because it
waxes and wanes
but it's critical to have because it
forms our baseline
of a goal-oriented desire to get
somewhere
inspiration is like i'm going to do this
motivation is what is the this that i'm
doing
where am i going so the most important
thing you can have
to stay motivated to get motivated and
stay motivated is a clear end goal for
the diet motivated for what
i want to lose 15 pounds by december
31st
that is a goal that you can motivate to
because people say like hey are you
motivated to train next question is to
train for what are you motivated to die
to diet for what
having a clear goal is super super
important so once you get inspired
let's say you're helping your clients
once they get inspired you show them a
transformation photo like
i want to do this the next conversation
is to talk about what this
actually is and if it's a realistic goal
yet a challenging goal
one that's going to make themselves feel
really happy but it's attainable that's
the best combination
super important but there are some minor
factors that can also help being around
positive people always helps
if you've got tons of positive people
around it's easy to stay motivated
here's another one seeing positive
results day to day maybe
definitely week to week keeps your
motivation much higher and letting them
sink in
like you lost three pounds last week and
then you lost two pounds this past week
and then the next week after you lose
another two pounds
oh my god i'm really doing it that can
boost your motivation like crazy
and it's awesome to be able to let
yourself experience that and accept it
which means
you're like yeah i lost weight but
whatever like no no i lost weight
because i'm doing the good thing i'm
getting on track to meet my goal
as you see your goal getting closer gee
you know that's a lot of motivation
eventually as your goal gets
real close you could just have this
fright train feeling behind you
where you're like there's nothing
stopping me but early in the diet it's
tough so you need inspiration to get you
going
and then you need to catch on to
motivation as quickly as possible by
making sure
you're doing a good job which we'll get
to in a second but on your way to the
goal if that goal feels hazy
the first clutches of kind of like you
know up on the ladder you can make are
okay i lost a pound i'm doing well i
actually stuck to my diet i'm doing well
i'm doing well i'm doing well and all of
a sudden you're doing super well and it
builds on itself
another way it builds on itself is you
overcoming temptations and being proud
of that
not only did i lose a pound and a half
last week but last friday all my friends
and i went out to this restaurant that i
usually love to order
disgusting fatty shit from i stuck
to the healthier menu i still had some
good food i still had a good time but i
didn't break my plan
and i came home and when no one's around
i was like
yes yes i didn't succumb i
overcame and boy oh boy does that boost
motivation
you will ride that wave for days and
just the diet will be super easy
so that stuff is really good and
alternatively
if you don't overcome temptation if you
succumb to temptation if you're like all
right i'll have
i'll have nachos with you guys you just
float through the world
it can actually take a little bit away
from your motivation
so people will say like okay i ate
nachos yesterday but i'm back on the
plan that's actually hard to do a lot
of people when they fail on their diet
they're like what's the point
i suck because their motivation is down
motivation is almost self-reinforcing
that way
there's other things here that we'll
talk about specifically discipline and
willpower
that are not self-reinforcing they're
self-extinguishing the more of them you
use
at least in the short term the more they
deplete but motivation is like the more
that you have
the more of it you get which is really
really awesome motivation
plotted on this graph looks like this
yellow squiggly line
it keeps your adherence up there it's
not it's not inspiration which you see
is the beginning red line it doesn't
just fall off
right but it goes up and it goes down
and if you let it go up and down and you
only ever
perform wherever it is so if you're
highly motivated you do a great job on
the diet if you're low
on the low end you do a crappy job right
notice you didn't quit the diet all
together it's not at zero
but your adherence is sucky look sucky
adhering sometimes means that if you
have sucky adherence here and you have
good adherence here and you do this to
that you actually get no results
especially in fat loss
so motivation is not good enough
we need something else and that next
something else is intention
okay motivation is a goal
your goal can be to lose 15 pounds and
it's sort of like a moth to the light
drives you over there but how to get
from point a to point b
is intention intention is what you do
it's a commitment
to execute a plan okay
my goal is to lose 15 pounds you can say
but i intend
to eat four balanced meals per day to
get there because remember
no goal in the world is helping you with
anything unless you do the things it
takes to get there like you could really
want to drive to disney world
but if you don't have a car and you
don't have a map you're not going to
disney world plain and simple
wanting to go to disney world motivation
intention
is getting on your phone google maps
seeing the shit
packing your car full of stuff and
beginning that's intention
the plan itself right not just a goal
but a road map of what actually to do
what is it good for well it sets a clear
what to do and what not to do
so it's really easy to be like okay i
want to lose 15 pounds right okay sweet
okay how do i do that exactly well if
you have intention you have a plan
and now it's super simple not only does
motivation make you want to do it but
intention gives you
a level of where you have to be every
hour every day
every week of if you do this you will
succeed if you do less you won't
if you do more sweet this is what you
need to do these are the meals you need
this is when you need to weigh in this
is the exercise you do so on and so on
and so on
right if you're motivated for a goal but
you don't have intention then you just
have a wish
you say i want to go to disney world
someone's like have you looked up how
far away it is you're like
no so you wish to go to disney world
well yeah i don't plan to go to disney
world notice that term
plan what is planning it means you have
a plan right intention is how you get
there
it is critical and a lot of people just
don't even know it exists
to be like i want to stay motivated stay
motivated for what like to lose weight
to lose 50 pounds great how are you
going to do that
uh hmm by dieting like sweet what kind
of diet like
eating less how much less that's where a
ton of people fail is they don't have
a plan of some kind so the biggest thing
we can do
to boost intention and don't worry i'll
come back to what it's not good for a
sec
is having a clear diet plan where you
get that is a much smaller concern yes
the rpe we have the app and it gives you
that plan and it
checks in all your meals for you and you
stay accountable awesome
we have templates we have coaches but
there's a bunch of companies that do
stuff like that and they're all super
well not all bunch of them suck
but a bunch of the evidence-based ones
do really really good work and you can
even make a plan yourself it's not that
hard you can read a book and write a
plan
and it's all gravy but you have to have
a plan otherwise
you're free in the wind you have no idea
where you're going or you want to lose
weight but wants aren't good enough
now a really good way to have intentions
that have a really good solid plan but
also a little bit of wiggle room a
little bit of flexibility to make sure
it's a realistic plan
and someone that can really help is a
coach this is where coaching really
helps
so if you're the coach to someone you
could really help them with their
intentions
by being there knowing the plan helping
them draft the plan
and holding them accountable to it it's
one thing to say to your clients hey
how's your diet man they're not good
you're like sweet
it's another thing to be like how has
your diet been and they're like i ate
three out of four meals properly
yesterday and you're like
what happened to the fourth meal they're
like i ate out of the garbage can
they're like all right this is
ridiculous right
so coaching is huge to both set
intentions help people set their
intentions
and to help them execute by drafting the
plan working feedback on the plan
helping so on and so on and so on now
what is intention not good for
and this really sets up the the slide
after this well the next
we'll do the attention graphic and then
the slide after the concept after the
construct
after intention is not good for
enforcement
intentions don't enforce themselves if
you could have any fucking plan in the
world
you should just not do it okay so you
can you can have the greatest plan ever
and you're like sweet
and then you still have to do the work
to meet your actual intention
how are you going to do the work to meet
it when your motivation is good the
work is easy right when you're motivated
you can do anything but remember
motivation waxes and wanes so it's not
always there
so what intention does for us is it sets
up and this is the visual that we have
in this next one
it sets up this this little thin blue
dotted line i have here
intention tells you this is the
adherence level you're going to be at
and here's how you're going to do it
intention is you've got to do this eat
four meals a day
or whatever do this much cardio not eat
this other crap and so on and so on and
so on
notice here that when motivation is
higher than this blue line by definition
we're kicking ass easy we're doing it
our adherence is higher
but what happens when the motivation
that the yellow curve
drops below the blue line that means we
cannot meet our intentions
we're not meeting our intentions and
we're not doing a good job on the diet
what do we have then that steps in is
construct number four
discipline here's the real gap closer
discipline is very easy to define it is
the use of willpower
to meet your intentions when motivation
is not sufficient to do it
like if you're really motivated to do
something you don't need willpower
okay imagine like you have to go
get uh drinks to go like pre-party
or a super fun night on the town with
your friends can someone say like man
you're really disciplined
to go get those drinks like what i'm
disciplined taking the car and going to
the
to the beer store and getting beer and
coming back and drinking with my friends
like no like well it must take a lot of
willpower
what like i want to do it this is great
this is going to be a super fun night
i'm motivated to do it
and my motivation is higher than the
intention of getting into the car and
getting the beer buying it and bringing
it back
it's a no-brainer the easiest thing in
the world like breathing it's actually
more fun than just sitting around okay
it's more likely to happen than not
happen
but the thing is dieting is not always
like going to party with your friends it
can be tough
and sometimes your motivation dips below
your intentions
so willpower or sorry discipline is
really good
to be able to direct our willpower to
close the gaps
between motivation and intention on your
low motivation days so that your
adherence is
on point to your intentions and you are
succeeding
right that's what discipline is good for
is filling in the gaps
between what your intentions are and
when your motivation is just a little
too low it's for the tough days that's
it
so it's indispensable for that
because your motivation's not always
going to be as high as your intentions
but
it's not good for sustainable use people
say discipline is everything that's not
true
because willpower runs out quick and it
needs
a long time to recharge back to its
normal levels right it needs to be
regularly recharged
if you have like five days in a row
where your intentions are still there
but your motivation is super low and use
willpower to fill it in like
willpower is teeth grinning stuff like i
don't want a diet
i'm a fucking adult i'm gonna do this
eat your stupid meals and
ignore all the tacos people are eating
and drive home like this pissed
that's willpower that shit runs out on
you if you do five days of that straight
on the sixth day
you might like just cheat and binge and
just don't care anymore because you ran
out of willpower it's possible
so you need motivation to be close to
your intentions
and this is a huge part of proper goal
setting
if your intentions is like i'm gonna be
mr olympia style diet
and your motivation on your best days
doesn't even get there
you're not gonna be able to fill that
gap with willpower if your intentions
are here and your motivation goes like
this you can use willpower to fill in
the gaps no problem
because you use willpower for a few
hours or minutes or hours or days
and then the motivation wanes back up
just like it does mysteriously come back
uh goes back and forth then all of a
sudden when it wanes back up
you don't have to use willpower anymore
you don't have to be disciplined and you
just do what you do
uh because it's super motivating to do
because you want to do it and during
that time your willpower recharges so
you can use it with discipline again
later
no big deal right so discipline is not
sustainable but it doesn't have to be
because motivation will take back over
and then it'll secede it'll take back
over and then we just
back and forth just like that this is
really the sort of the yin and yang of
dieting
is knowing when your intentions you
knowing that your intentions are this
and if you're motivated sweet take the
easy road but if you're not it's time to
use discipline
by applying your willpower appropriately
to close the gaps
now how can we boost our discipline huge
questions there's tons of books have
been run out and i'm not going to do any
justice but one big one
is knowing that there will be hard times
and not being surprised by them a lot of
people are under this
crazy illusion and i mean a lot of
people
maybe most that dieting is about finding
the right motivation and then you're
just on easy street you're killing it
that's just not true
even folks at the very top of their game
have days where they just don't want to
do shit
and then they have to be disciplined
about it right
if you know that the hard times are
coming when they come and you don't feel
motivated enough to meet your intentions
you're going to be like okay i don't
feel great i don't want to diet but hold
on a second i knew this was coming
and i know i have discipline to be able
to exert my willpower
no big deal right so knowing is coming
is half the battle literally is
coaches and friends are huge here to
keep you accountable so that you
actually use your willpower
right especially coaches will lean on
you and be like it's time to be
disciplined and you're like yes
i know what that means and i knew it was
coming and good news is
practice does improve your abilities you
exert willpower
using your discipline once it could seem
like you're fighting a fucking dragon
you do it twice a large upset pig you do
it three times a canary
you swat it with a tennis racket right
so you get better and better better over
time especially if you
let motivation come in and recharge your
actual discipline
so that you recharge your willpower
rather so that you're not using it when
it's super super low on battery
as you use it and it sort of depletes
when it recharges
a lot of times it recharges to a little
bit greater now eventually it peters out
but
it peters out at really huge levels
sometimes people get to like navy seal
level of discipline
where they can like do a year of
insanity and just not give a shit
right and yeah they are using willpower
the whole time but they have an almost
infinite
supply of it most of us when we start
out with dieting and most of us that
fail dieting we do not have a very high
supply with it so we need to make sure
we get it right
we need to know what's coming and we
need to look forward to the fact that
eventually we will get better at it
right a really really good quote i
really like is dieting doesn't get
easier you just get a lot better at it
same idea here so discipline really easy
to show graphically on this chart
discipline is those little little blue
margins that are filled in
right there discipline fills in the gaps
literally
between your motivation and intention
it's super awesome to have but remember
that
if that's that blue fluid we're putting
into the gaps there to meet them
we only have so much of it any one time
we run out it recharges
but we can't do it too much if we have a
huge dip in motivation
that outlasts our willpower then we're
going to fail on the diet
almost by definition right your
willpower has been broken you've run out
of it
and it's not easy times here this can be
a little scary
because you can think holy shit i'm
going to be battling i might have
12-week diet and it's going to be a
battle for the next 12 weeks
of yeah i might get a little bit better
at using my willpower but like it's
going to be a battle of motivation
discipline motivation discipline like
this sucks hold on there's really good
news
and that good news is the fifth
construct of habit
habit is the automation of dieting
so that motivation waxes and wanes a lot
less the longer you diet
used to be your motivation was super
high and then super low and then super
high and super low
and what habit does is it just raises it
slightly
and then the ups and downs just get
really really small
right how motivated are you to brush
your teeth
not really okay how
demotivated are you to just stop
brushing your teeth
really how much do you think about how
much willpower do you have to use to
brush your teeth
good god almost none the bare minimum
right why because it's a habit you've
been doing it for forever
if dieting can become habitual it
becomes 50 trillion times easier
because it creates less of a demand for
discipline
and for the use of willpower by raising
your adherence abilities
that's unbelievable so essentially we
have this problem right where we're
going to use our
discipline to fight willpower for or
sorry to fight motivation for forever
motivation's high or discipline
motivation discipline but all of a
sudden those gaps start to narrow
and we have the same amount of
discipline as warriors have we have the
same amount of ability to exert
willpower actually more
but our demand for exerting that will
power is less and less and less as
things become habituated
all right once diets are habits
success rates skyrocket okay
you could even say that the motivational
psychology
or the adherence psychology of training
so of being a diet coach
can be summed up as getting your clients
to habit
if you can get someone to the habit
stage of this process
it's like the biggest difference in the
world and short of them getting to have
it
none of this is sustainable and it
really just doesn't work right
this allows adherence to be in the long
term now habit is not an all-powerful
thing it's incredibly powerful but
if you talk to people who have a diet
habit they're actually really crappy in
a couple of things
one is giving you an initial spark you
could talk to someone who's
habitually dieting and have just been
eating healthy for a long time
like one of my friends um from new york
when uh nick shawna our personal trainer
jesse
he's a personal trainer there and he
just had a habit of eating healthy food
and he just always ate healthy this is
what he did and did it for so long
that if you asked him like hey like how
do i like really get pumped to eat
healthy he'd be like
um i you know man i don't know i just
this is kind of like when i go into
the restaurant i just order healthy by
default and a lot of us are like that
right
so habit doesn't give you an initial
spark habit
happens way way later you have to have
the initial spark you have to have the
motivation you have to
use a ton of discipline and willpower
there's no way around that stuff but
eventually it catches on
and habit is not good enough to make you
fall in love with the dieting process
which we'll talk about next which is
passion
right you can just have a habit look
like you're in the habit of brushing
your teeth
you don't love brushing your teeth okay
it's not hard it's easy to do you'll
never not do it but you're not in love
with it so some people be like oh as
soon as you get to be
habitual you'll fall in love like maybe
not maybe i'll hate it right so it's not
good for that and it's not good for the
national spark but it's good for
everything in between which is
really most of everything right so
here's the thing if habit is so
important if getting to habit is so
important
how do we make sure we are on our best
to try to get habit
up as high as possible as quickly as
possible and have it be as good as
possible so here's the deal
one really good tip and there's tons of
others it's just examples
using bulk meal prep and using similar
foods week to week
okay if you prep all your meals in
advance every three or four days or
every week
getting into the habit of eating healthy
is super easy because like you just open
up your fridge and there's tupperware
you just do it
right if you have to make your meals
from scratch geez that's tough
that's not even a habit really that's
like a way of life that's crazy
right but if you pre-prep your meals
they're almost habitual already and then
you get used to eating prep meals holy
crap
dining is just a matter of doing this
and not cheating that's easy right so a
lot of people dieting means like every
single meal is like a choice decision
process
what am i going to eat and there's all
this temptation and there's always ideas
about what good food is but if you prep
all your meals in advance you just
three or four days of instant habit
right
having similar meal times day to day
really really important right
it's 12 p.m i eat my lunch i eat my
tupperware meal for lunch
it's four p.m i mean mid-afternoon snack
and so on and so on and so on
if you don't have dedicated meal times
you'd skip a meal or wait too long or
not wait long enough
and all of a sudden you're super hungry
and you end up making bad choices but if
you have your meals pre-prepped and you
have specific meal times throughout the
day
gee that really sets you up for habits
super super easy you just don't have to
use a whole lot of willpower because
it's just so easy to just not have to do
it at all it's just there for you
already
lastly is keep in mind the time and as
someone if you're watching this as a
personal trainer as a coach
this is a real big thing to keep in mind
and if you're watching it as a
prospective client or somebody that
wants to apply this to themselves it's
also important to keep in mind
time executing the diet is a big factor
we tend to see that four to six weeks in
most diets get much more habitual they
just start to pick up into habit
which means what that means in the first
four to six weeks of a diet
if it's not easy if it's not habitual
don't worry about it it will get there
do your best with bulk meal prep and
eating times and so on and so forth to
get there
but don't freak out and don't be like oh
my god you know three weeks into a diet
you're like dude
i'm trying really hard here this is a
confusing process that feels like it's
new every day
no worries right you look around your
people everyone else has a habit and
you're like
my hook of mine doesn't feel like it's
automated it's okay
it takes a month sometimes two but once
it hits
holy crap you're on easy street for sure
and that's helpful right because if you
tell someone hey look like i want you to
put
your feet into this ice for a million
dollars
and they ask okay like how long do i
have to put my feet in the ice for and
they're like
i don't know at some point we'll tell
you when to take it out you'll win a
million
holy crap most people will just have to
like i don't know 30 seconds i'd be like
i don't need this i don't need a million
dollars i want my feet
but if you tell someone look two minutes
is when you get the million dollars
they can hang in through unbelievable
pain it's just a fact
just the same way if you tell them look
after about four or six weeks
your diet will get notably easier
because your habits will start to kick
in
in week three when they want to quit if
they didn't know that they'd be like
well i'm this is this hard now it's
probably just gonna keep getting harder
because my body's gonna resist fat loss
even more
i'm out but if they know week three is
the toughest week
and then at week four and so on it gets
easier maybe they'll hang in
really good to tell them really good to
tell yourself so visually
habit looks like this right notice that
the
motivation waxes and wanes less okay the
amplitude closes
and the average motivation level goes up
so all of a sudden the amount of
willpower we have to use to fill in
the gap between motivation and attention
is just not that high
easy this is awesome right so adherence
is easier to do you have a higher level
of adherence with habit
and motivation used to go up and down a
lot and it just doesn't go up and down
that much anymore
really really cool how much does your
motivation to brush your teeth go up and
down
it's so habitual that just like i don't
know sometimes you want to do a little
less sometimes you're really excited
about your teeth because they feel dirty
right nothing to write home about
whereas with dieting or sometimes you
want to
hate it and throw it away and sometimes
you can't wait to do a really good job
lastly and we do mean lastly because
this is lastly both in the
how long it takes to open up this phase
and also in terms of importance
is passion right passion is the love of
the dieting process
and a lot of us folks that are watching
this are professionals in the field one
way or another we actually are
passionate about diet
passion is really good for fueling your
adherence to insane levels
right and that either leads to super
easy and fun dining experiences
for just health and wellness or the
ability to get super shredded and take
your diet to the next level because you
have
that much more ability to adhere passion
gives you super adherence powers
but it has its limitations passion is
not good for
something you can get in just a few
weeks so a lot of psycho personal
trainers or fitness influencers on
instagram they're like i'm gonna make
you passionate about fitness like
no that takes months and years you can't
do that what they mean is inspired
passion and inspiration are two very
different things passion lasts maybe
forever
but it takes a long time to earn and not
everyone gets there
inspiration is cheap easy and lasts for
hours or days
right two very different things you can
inspire people in minutes
you can't make them passionate even
weeks there's never a guarantee of
passion but
there are ways to increase the chances
and the passion is not for everyone as
long as you have habits you're good to
go
passion is optional but it can be a
great thing a couple of ways to boost it
you can let the successes of dieting get
to your head like you got abs for the
first time in your life and you're like
oh my god i can't believe i did it
i love this and all of a sudden the next
diet you do
you might love and all of a sudden
you're in passion you want to diet with
friends and like-minded people
that support you and are positive
they're getting results you're getting
results you're living the same fitness
lifestyle
when you're going to the beach you're
bringing healthy food in the cooler oh
my god it's tough not to be passionate
about that kind of thing
huge one is taking breaks from the diet
to do easier dieting more cheat meals
etc
when you need it and never letting diet
become this terrible route to endless
suffering
if you diet tough tough tough and it
starts really getting tough
you ease up you maintain you eat some
good foods you have fun
your diet fatigue goes down you have
relief
you look back you have this great shape
and you're not diet fatigue you do
another diet where it gets tough
and then you do the same thing after a
while you're like oh my god i'm a
fucking dieting machine i love this
whole thing because there's nothing bad
it's like working at your favorite job
for five days and having an awesome
weekend for two days
and you get to go back to work at your
favorite job but if you work at your
favorite job for seven days a week
and then for five weeks straight on some
crazy project
you could be mind numb you don't even
know what weekends are you could really
start to lose
any kind of excitement or any kind of
love for it and your adherence could
start to falter
so a big part about dieting properly and
enhancing the chances of not just having
good habits but good passion
is to make sure you're taking breaks
when you need them huge part
huge part another big part is having fun
with dieting getting into cooking
getting into recipes having fun with
your foods if you eat
chicken breast and white rice and that's
the only thing you think is dieting
very difficult to get passionate about
that let's be completely honest and
a really big way to get passionate
sometimes it's not for everyone is to
help other people with their diets
once you have other people have success
it's really easy to fall in love with
the whole process
and um our little graphic here passion
is this sort of forest green little wavy
thing and notice
passion still has its its motivational
undertones remember we said motivation
lasts the entire time for the rest of
your life
but notice that the waxes and wanes are
very small now even smaller than they
were inhabit
but the route is up almost like in an
exponential
manner passion is when your ability to
end here
just keeps climbing up to crazy heights
because you're just in love with the
process if we can get someone to passion
holy crap we wouldn't have an obesity
problem in the united states
it's not likely we will we can get a lot
of people to have it though and it
really is worth trying
so it's all about the long term
most people can diet for a few weeks but
few make it more than that
if you know all the six constructs of
adherence
you can boost them as much as possible
and we can keep more people
including ourselves on the diet train
towards habit and once we have people
habitually dieting properly
for health or for fat loss or whatever
we're already in a winning battle
not everyone will get to passion but
habit is more than good enough for most
and it's a really good start if you know
these constructs
you can become a better coach not just
for yourself
but for other people as well folks give
this some thought shoot some questions
in the comments
maybe we'll do another one of these for
training we'll see
see you next time
you
