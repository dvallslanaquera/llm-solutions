like
completely covered in sweat hey bernardo
this isn't an odd opportunity for you to
go to sleep let's go we got enough
[Music]
all right folks dr mike here jared
feather here
we are here for the battle of joe
versus pro trevor fulbright representing
the joes
this man trains hard we'll find out how
hard later
bernardo costa ifbb pro physique pro
look at this man
he's enormous what is trevor going to do
about it we're going to see
leg workout we're going to start out
with leg curls seated
just to get a little bit hamstring
action and then leg press
insanity followed by high bar squat
let's get it done
[Music]
all right folks we're starting with the
leg curl
a lot of folks will start with a
compound movement first
which is a really good idea the thing is
for these guys they're going to be
hitting it so hard for quads
that after quads there's just not enough
systemic
fatigue left over to work with so then
leg curls
and any hamstring work after would be
really stupid
by doing leg curls early we get a great
stimulus for the hamstrings
and it's not an exercise that's very
systemically fatiguing so it leaves them
super fine to do a great stimulus on the
leg press and high bar spot after
this isn't the way to do it it's a way
to do it give it a shot if it makes
sense to you
these guys are going to be doing about
four sets of leg curls roughly in the
10 to 20 rep range nothing crazy this
definitely is a quad emphasis workout
let's get the leg curls done and after
we're going to start on lag press
good cheers come on
last one yep one more
oh yeah one more let's go let's go let's
go
[Music]
oh yeah hell yeah trevor
beautiful i've never seen anybody grind
through a hamstring wrap like that
that was wild no fuck that rest
breathe oh yeah oh shit
oh shit there we go hold it easy control
rest two
control control
yeah beautiful that's it oh yeah
oh yeah
one two
[Music]
fuck one more one more one more go go go
go
that's it good stuff
all right folks it is time
for the leg press
[Music]
sets of 10 to 20 reps probably on the
higher end of that to begin with
oh probably four sets or so get the
quads nice and cooked before high bar
squats
full range of motion we're gonna be
rigging the machine a little bit with a
back pad probably to get even deeper
these guys are the kings of rom we will
see how it goes
oh yeah three wraps
[Music]
two
[Music]
one more
let's go let's go
the funny thing is this people think
it's youtube versus each other no the
leg press always wins
us always it's the third surprise
entrant
yep
[Music]

we're not helping him with these
motherfuckers you better do this shit
yourself
you're a psychopath
look at that butt crack get his butt
cracks fight on camera
yeah yeah so bernardo is
actually a client of mine ifbb pro
to the battle of texas got some feedback
they said the legs need to be a little
bigger
he keeps training like that i think it's
gonna happen
oh yeah
[Music]
go breathe however many you want
[Music]
about set here it's your call
[Music]
let's go yes yes
[Music]
let's fucking go trevor let's go
fuck good stuff
these men are animals
[Music]
squats we're going to do it on the smith
machine for two reasons
one is these folks are so messed up from
the leg press that a lot of the
stability is gone
free high bar squats will be totally
fine smith is just a little bit more
convenient allow a little bit more drive
technique sort of handles itself a
little bit more and two
there's a bunch of photo shoots here and
there's people on the actual free
squat area so we're not so
confrontational so we didn't tell them
to go
half off but anyway about three sets
here
uh the squats are going to be slow
controlled as always and
uh sets of probably about five to ten
five to fifteen reps
because the quad's already so messed up
they're so close to failure when they
start they just don't need that many
reps to get the job done
let's get at it squads go go
good shit what
go go go go go go go go go
six and a half six and a half
you got a couple more take your time
keep it in the quads
go
actually good seven yeah
damn i wonder how many people in the
comment section
be like wow this guy yeah
185 what a bitch
like completely covered in sweat hey
bernardo this isn't an odd opportunity
for you to go to sleep
let's go we got another second one
push up there it is five
nobody's helping you with these man i'm
tired
let's go push yep one more last one keep
it in the quad make it hard
it's going to be hard don't you let that
ass race first
rods squad lead with a chest
i can't upright row 185.
you did try that is all we asked you
kept in the quads that was good
it's got to be encouraging when you're
training partners crawling away from the
rack
you're up next like go out trevor you
got questions
[Music]
get
oh you both did it i swear to god we
didn't plan this
motherfucker said six okay this shit
now
[Laughter]
a bond a bond has been created
folks we have pro
versus joe and we learned something
really important today
high volume quad training always wins
that's all we got jared you got anything
oh good stuff guys
all right awesome excellent effort from
both growing is a matter of applying the
proper principles and then going harder
harder harder harder until something
like this happens
and you can't go any harder you take a
break you come back you recycle you
repeat
and then you have bigger legs
these guys don't look right anyway see
you next time
[Music]
you
