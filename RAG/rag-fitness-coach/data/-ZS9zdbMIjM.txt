hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization in today's video is about
the three pieces of Gym gear
that advanced bodybuilders have to have
of course that's a clickbait title but
three pieces of Gym gear that I think
have huge benefits for advanced
bodybuilding and please make all the
inside gear jokes you would like in the
comments it boosts the algorithm
here's the deal
first
what is an advanced bodybuilder
it is somebody in my view
the best definition for this I've been
able to come up with
is somebody for whom the basics executed
normally no longer cause reliable gains
for whom even some insight like oh I
have to start deloading I have to start
following program
they no longer produce reliable gains
this individual has to have training go
as well as possible in order for any
gains to be even highly probabilistic
otherwise the default is no gains at all
that's right you have seen people
training for years at your gym
putting in lots of effort and not
seemingly progressing you could
technically call them Advanced if they
have already done a lot of the basics
pretty well and it's just the nuances
they're riding on for folks in that
situation nuances matter as far as
executing your training for example at
that point technique has to be
personalized to whatever gives you the
best stimulus to fatigue ratio not
somebody else I've got intermediate can
squat like most people and get decent
squat results an advanced person may
have to squat very differently for their
own body type or even abandon squats
altogether and search out other better
stimulus to fatigue ratio exercises
with nuances like that it also makes
sense that some Gym gear stuff you could
buy and take with you that help you lift
may also start to make advantages at the
advanced level that are um
difficult to ignore and unwise to kind
of relegate to thinking well you know
you could use this stuff but you don't
have to use it no no this stuff really
does pay big dividends especially for
the advanced
first thing
first on that list
is the Versa grip
the Versa grip company they've ignored
all my calls and emails I never called
or emailed them but I did talk to them
once at the Arnold and I was like Hey
like I have a following and I want to
rep you guys I don't need any money just
want to be able to say that we're cool
and they're like yeah we don't do uh we
don't do uh brand sponsorships or
athletes okay
uh you guys are cool anyway
oh look a train I have to catch and I
ran under the train and committed
suicide so that didn't go so well but so
this is not any kind of sales pitch I
make nothing off of this or anything
else really here
Versa grips
Versa grips essentially
are the modern version of a lifting
strap and they are categorically better
in almost every way they're all pretty
close to Magic
if you wrap the Versa grip handle around
something and put your hand on top of it
there's a very good chance your entire
hand will fall off of the bone before
that Versa grip breaks or is let go
right or let's go and because of that
major advantage Versa grips can take
back training
deadlift training any training where you
have to pull the arms especially
shoulder training how do you do laterals
with your regular grip is beyond me
if your shoulders have gotten as strong
as most people's shoulders get in
relation to their grip if your back has
gotten as big as strong as it usually
will in relation to your grip if your
legs get as strong for stiff-legged
deadlifts and dumbbell lunges Etc
as strong as the normal people's legs
get when they're advanced in relation to
their grip because their grip gets
stronger but the back and the traps and
they're often and the legs for sure
often way stronger muscle groups if that
happens you can no longer use many
exercises
without grip becoming the predominant
limiting factor when you're training
your back short of like lat prayers and
a few other things
your grip may be the only thing you are
training very hard after a while if you
get Versa grips now of course you can
have regular straps or fine chalk is
very good but Versa grips show me that
you are interested in the highest level
of grip ability and you're just
interested in completely shutting off
the living Factor you can do machine
roads and it's all just down to your
back amazing huge dividends I can't
recommend this product more
if you haven't gotten it and you tell me
your Advanced then I see your workouts
you better have the strongest fucking
grip of all time
or you just haven't thought things
through
next
weight lifting belt
any kind of belt is really good I prefer
the Pioneer brand belts because they
have so much customization
and they're really high quality but
other belt companies are fine
some of them very good in fact
a weightlifting belt
or a lifting belt in general doesn't
have to be for the sport of
weightlifting
a a lifting belt allows you to create a
high level of intra-abdominal pressure
in your core and lumber region
which allows you to transduce more of a
signal to contract especially your legs
during heavy leg training
and what that does is just eeks out more
ability out of your legs now as a
beginner as an intermediate that
probably just doesn't matter that much
and your legs and core will be ratio
relatively strong enough to each other
that you have a core realistically that
can outlift your legs and it's never too
weak but your legs get stronger than
your core we know this because almost
every Power lifter of the high level
when it is legal to do so will wear a
lifting belt the reason for that is
pretty simple the core tends to be a
weak link
and if you make it stronger via the
addition of a belt notice you're not
making the core stronger itself you're
making the whole system of core Plus
belt stronger
if you use a belt you can get more out
of your legs
and as a hard lifting lifter if you're
doing hack squats if you're doing
regular squats if you're doing good
mornings as a high
Advanced bodybuilder
you probably are interested in putting
out a belt because it will just maximize
what you get out of your glutes your
hamstrings and your quads at the very
least
and if you're going to do any kind of
deadlifting it also keeps your back nice
and safe at heavier loads than you would
normally be able to use which is a
really really big deal it's a big help
is it mandatory of course
but does it make the situation better
where it actually makes your legs get
absolutely higher raw stimulus magnitude
training yes
yes it sure does will it make your core
weaker to wear a belt yes but only if
you wear a belt and never increase how
much weight you're lifting above what
you could have done without a belt if
you can squat 225 for 10 without a belt
this you put on a belt on squat to 25
for 10 and never go above the 20 or 30
extra pounds the belt can let you lift
for the same reps
then yeah sure shit your core will get
weaker the belt will remain and that
it'll be harder to squat 225 for 10
without the belt in a few weeks why the
fuck would you do that
you put on the belt so you can go and
get stronger in your legs and now you
can squat 240
with a belt for tens
225 for 10 with about without a belt
will still feel weirder and for a few
weeks you'll be weaker just because
you've learned to use the belt so well
but the underlying strength and size of
the core musculature will continue to go
up a fuse about if you challenge
yourself
so if you ever want to take the belt off
it'll feel weird to use it no belt
squats for a while but then very shortly
within several weeks literally two or
three you will be as strong as you ever
were without the belt amazing
lastly number three are weightlifting
shoes these are shoes for the sport of
weightlifting they have a heel
and uh an easy slow ramp that ends at
about three quarters of an inch to one
and a quarter inch typically at the end
in the heel itself
these shoes allow for a huge amount of
stability and leg training movements
they allow a ton of friction between
whatever it is you're standing on and
the shoe itself
and because they have that ramp
situation the actual heel lift you get
two things out of it one is you can now
go much deeper with all sorts of
pressing and squatting movements and get
your quads at better stimulus
and concomitantly you don't have to lean
forward as far because your ankle
Mobility is now higher because of that
heel so you can actually take stress off
of the back and put it into the quads
amazing and also you have the ability
now in many more situations with a
deeper range of motion to continue to
press through your heels and your the
front of your feet and if you can press
through the whole foot you can lift more
weight activate more faster switch motor
units and get bigger and stronger
bigger for sure
so weightlifting shoes not only put your
quads into the best possible position to
get torched because they allow your knee
to have more flexion with less of your
back inflection
so they allow you to go deeper and
provide more profound forces they
essentially allow you to expose your
quads by putting them kind of in a
weaker position but a more challenging
position for them
but at the same time the weightlifting
shoes arm your quads with the ability to
be super stable and press through the
heel
which is kind of the ultimate in
engineering the best possible leg
training
when you put on weightlifting shoes
versus not having used them you take any
hack squat leg press regular free Squat
and turn it into a movement we were like
holy shit I'm getting a lot deeper
this is hard but also this feels smooth
as fuck and I feel fucking strong
the best possible combination you could
ever see
I will say how people train their quads
at a high level without weight lifting
shoes is beyond me entirely but then you
look at how a lot of ifb pro quote
unquote train their quads and you could
like really improve the shed out of the
training if you showed them how to use
weightlifting shoes and proper technique
now those three things I think if you're
an advanced lifter you should highly
consider does that mean you should stay
away from these tools as a beginner or
as an intermediate no
but what I would say is you can get a
lot without them they do cost money they
do wear down you'll have to replace them
and the best reasoning I have for you is
give me a compelling reason why you need
these tools and I will say it's a good
idea to get them for example
if you're a beginner and you never have
grip as limiting problem why aren't
fucking God's name do you need Versa
grips
fact checked problem solved
weightlifting belt if your legs are on
fire they're getting sore for five days
in a row your core is still getting
stronger you never have an issue where
you're like man if I had a belt I could
share a ship more lift more with my legs
and my weak course keep me away from
being able to have stronger legs that's
just not a thing up until most people
get most women get Beyond two plates on
the squat for full depth and most men
get the other three plates on a squat a
lot of times for most people a belt
doesn't even uh just that's like doing a
whole lot of nothing just sitting there
and weightlifting shoes
is one of these things where you could
get pretty early but they're pretty
expensive and have a requirement big
investment so if you've been Lifting for
like six months or a year or a year and
a half and you really love the process
and you know you're not going to quit
anytime soon yeah you get weightlifting
shoes is totally fine
um and also it pays to
just have a situation where you don't
really over invest in this shit it's
like a lot of people buy 200
weightlifting shoes and then you just
don't lift anymore that's just sad and
weightlifting shoes really pay their big
dividends once you're bigger and
Mobility is a little bit harder and
you're lifting really really high loads
so the super technique stuff is
important and also when you're
constrained to variations that don't
include squatting like leg presses and
hack squats because squats are too
axially loading for you
then weightlifting shoes pay huge
dividends but if you can do a decent
barbell squat without weightlifting
shoes you can for years get bigger and
bigger and bigger in your legs and not
have to buy weightlifting shoes because
their benefit will be instant but it'll
be really small and maybe not worth the
200 that they cost now you can get
weightlifting shoes for 70 bucks
that's all good and well but just
um making sure I'm speaking to the
general audience member here like uh
yeah again if there's a compelling
reason definitely buy it when you're in
your intermediate years you may start to
develop these compelling reasons and
slowly buy up the stuff so by the time
you are an advanced lifter
you already have them I'm not saying
when you turn Advanced to whatever you
have your fifth Advanced birthday party
and balloons and stuff and a cloud that
people beat with a Piada
uh baseball bat that's what you do to
clowns I think once you get through the
pinata you turn your attention to the
Clown
but you don't have the uh
no more eye cover
put it on the clown tie them up no I'm
just kidding but maybe clowns are
terrible
don't just turn Advance then and buy
these things
as an intermediate you'll discover like
okay I really fucking need Versa grips
my grip is just huge limited factor I
need a belt I would like some weight
lifting shoes so that by the time you
enter Advanced you're already rolling
with all these things folks give that
some thought
