okay welcome everyone to a new episode
of myth bust
monday where every week we're going to
look at some new fitness
nutrition myth and look at where it was
that that myth came from
how it got started and why it's actually
wrong based on the most recent
scientific literature so this week we're
going to look at the idea that sugar
makes you fat um it's making all of us
fat and there's a lot to cover here
so let's just dig right in to begin
where did this myth
come from well in 1972 professor john
yudkin published a book titled pure
white and deadly how sugar is killing us
and what we can do to stop it which i
think was responsible for
first opening up the public to the idea
that sugar really is the enemy
when it comes to our health granted the
book didn't gain quite as much a claim
initially
as it has now because just two years
earlier the iconic
seven country study was published by
ansel keys
and that sort of shifted the public's
attention away from sugar
and on to dietary fat and that was a
shift that lasted for decades but
recently sugar has caught a little bit
more
of the spotlight in 2003 a review
article published in the american
journal of clinical nutrition
suggested that there are important
similarities between the trend in high
fructose corn syrup availability
and trends in the prevalence of obesity
in the united states and the authors
also correctly noted
that fructose and glucose have different
metabolic effects especially with regard
to insulin release and metabolism in the
liver and so they singled out fructose
as the main evil
rather than painting all sugars with the
same brush and some other systematic
reviews that
didn't adjust for total energy intake
also found a strong correlation between
sugar intake
and obesity so between yudkin's book a
pile of review articles
some systematic reviews and
documentaries to boot
i think it's pretty reasonable that a
large majority of the public
has come to accept this idea as
scientific truth so
where did it go wrong well the main
issue about the conclusions being drawn
about sugar
is that they make an unjustified jump
from correlation
to causation and of course just because
two things are correlated
like sugar and obesity doesn't imply
that
sugar is the cause of obesity just like
the correlation between
cheese consumption and tangled bed sheet
deaths does not imply that
eating cheese causes death by bed sheet
tangulation and while it is true that
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
has risen just as rates of obesity have
risen this correlation is the weakest
form
of evidence available especially since
other beverage consumption patterns
including bottled water as depicted in
this graph have also demonstrated a
strong correlation with obesity
in the united states a 2005 paper titled
sugar and health controversies
what does the science say concluded that
sugar doesn't make a unique contribution
to obesity
and suggests that in a condition as
complicated as obesity
it's highly unlikely that one single
nutrient would uniquely cause this
condition
it's more likely that the totality of
the diet including increased caloric
consumption from all sources
exerts a significant impact on the
likelihood of obesity for some more
global insight on this
let's take a look at australia where
between the years of 1980
and 2002 despite a 23 drop in refined
sucrose consumption
australia still experienced a threefold
increase in obesity
granted while epidemiological research
like this is a weak form of evidence the
australian diabetes council
acknowledges that these findings support
the supposition that once total energy
intake has been accounted for
per capita changes in energy from
sweeteners do not explain changes
in incidence of obesity and so while the
correlation is there
consumers of sugary drinks also tend to
eat more calories overall
they tend to exercise less and smoke
more and just have a
poorer dietary pattern in general and
all these things can be difficult to
measure
and adjust for in this epidemiological
observational research now there is also
some direct evidence suggesting that
sugar clearly is not to blame
for weight gain including a massive 2013
systematic review
looking at 68 studies which found that
if you replace dietary sugar with
other macronutrients and control for
caloric content
you don't see any change in body weight
and the authors note that this finding
strongly suggests that energy imbalance
is a major determinant of the potential
for dietary sugars
to influence measures of body fat so the
burning question is
at least in my mind if the evidence is
this week how is it that
so many members of the general public
are convinced that it's true
well i think that as highlighted in a
2013 review on this
it primarily comes down to three main
factors the first is the use of emotion
raising language
you guys may notice that anti-sugar
advocates will often use words like
plague dangerous evil deadly
when describing sugar and i think that
we need to be wary of this language
because this is a tactic used to sort of
heighten the
impact of their claims second is the
distortion of scientific
information and this mostly takes the
form of giving weak
epidemiological or observational
research more
weight than it deserves and implying
that a cause and effect relationship is
present when it simply isn't and the
third is the so-called mirror exposure
effect which refers to the idea that
the more frequently you hear something
whether true or false
the more likely you are to accept it as
true and dictators and marketers
have used this tactic for a long time
they know that repetition
is often the key to getting people to
accept the idea
that you're trying to get them to accept
and so while sugar probably isn't the
villain
it's made out to be that still doesn't
mean that you can just eat as much sugar
as you want
with no consequence the world health
organization recommends that added
sugars make up no more than 10 percent
of total calories however they do admit
that they base this recommendation
largely on the well-established
relationship
between added sugars and dental caries
or cavities
since the relationship between sugar
intake and weight change
is quote moderate to low in a 2010 blog
article
the bitter truth about fructose alarmism
alan aragon suggests a nice round
50 grams as a ballpark safe upper limit
for fructose intake
in adults so if you estimate fructose as
roughly 50
of your total sugar intake that would
leave you with about 100 grams as a
rough ballpark
for sugar intake as a safe upper limit
now of course this will be massively
individual and variable depending on
your specific lifestyle
and your total caloric intake but this
is just a nice round number to give you
something objective
to go on and i think that as a practical
takeaway while the research on the
satiating effect of sugar is actually
more mixed than
i think a lot of people believe one 2017
paper on sugar and satiety
suggests that people do tend to over
consume at meals
when sugary foods and drinks are labeled
as
healthy so just be careful of this
marketing scheme for sugary beverages
and
be aware of this tendency other than
that i really don't think that sugar
appears to play a very central role in
either the cause of obesity or type 2
diabetes and i think it's more important
for us to look at
the diet as a whole and the lifestyle as
a whole and rather than villainize a
single macronutrient we need to be wary
of foods that are
high in salt high in fat highly
processed highly palatable
and very energy dense and be aware of
the food environment that we're creating
in general okay so guys that's going to
wrap this one up there's a whole
bunch of literature that i just couldn't
get to in this video so if you guys are
interested in learning more i've
linked a ton of stuff in the description
below for further recommended reading
from me and before we go i'd like to
quickly thank skillshare for being the
first

which is something that i've personally
been trying to step my game up on
especially when it comes to social media
and of course here on youtube so a
premium membership to skillshare starts
at about 10 bucks a month however
skillshare was kind enough to offer my
subscribers
three months of access to all the
