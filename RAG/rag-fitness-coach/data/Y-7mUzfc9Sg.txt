hey folks
dr mike israel here for rp plus rpu
renaissance periodization
and the planet mars yeah
i'm not representing the earth today
mars folks think about it it's a little
further from the sun it's cooler it's
more red
fewer people on it just matt damon
really it's got its benefits
but for all the benefits that mars has
advanced hypertrophy has more
and this is lecture number six advanced
hypertrophy concepts and tools
damage and muscle growth oh boy what do
we have in store for today
first thing we're going to address is
why are we even talking about damage
muscle growth why is it important to ask
that's actually a really cool part of
this talk because a lot of people think
it's a superfluous topic i don't think
it is and we'll get to why
we'll talk about the correlational
evidence for damage causing growth
and there is a lot of it but correlation
is not that great
to lean on by itself so then we're going
to talk about the lack of direct
evidence for muscle damage and growth
we're going to talk about evidence
against muscle damage
causing growth right really evidence for
muscle damage
detracting from growth then we're going
to tie
all of that together with a model that
very likely explains the whole picture
which is the recovery versus adaptation
model we'll look at
three distinct ideas about how that
could play out they're very similar
but it lead to slightly different
training recommendations then we're
going right into
implications for training and of course
programming recommendations that you can
use
every day of your training life let's
get into it
why are we interested in muscle damage
and growth first of all just for shits
and giggles
it's a contentious topic like people
debate about it all the time so it's
cool
because it's fun and it's always
interesting to enter a debate where a
lot of people have a lot of really
heated opinions
number two as we covered in the last
uh lecture about muscle growth stimuli
knowing the mechanisms of muscle growth
can really help us uh target them
through appropriate training
like if you know if muscle damage
actually causes muscle growth
uh then g you know like we could use it
as a reliable indicator and sort of
chase it right if it doesn't maybe not
number three is related if damage um
you know does actually correlate some
way to growth
it's actually really easy to estimate
damage mostly through soreness and
uh performance uh alterations and how
you feel
so it's actually a really good tool to
auto regulate training so
if muscle damage has absolutely nothing
to do with training not like it doesn't
harm it or help it
then it's probably not a great auto
regulatory tool but if it's at least
very
highly correlated to results uh to
growth stimulus even if it's not
causative
then it's a great auto regulatory tool
because it's so easy to detect and so
easy to plan around
and change your training around and
lastly is because the answer to the
question of does muscle
does damage cause growth or what is the
relationship there
can very well give us different training
recommendations for example
we'll get into this much more detail
later if damage robustly causes growth
then anytime you're not getting sore in
your training reliably you probably are
growing the most
right um but if muscle damage actually
fights growth completely like in the
sense that any muscle damage is bad for
growth because it competes for the same
pool of resources in just a very
fixed pie sort of way then any amount of
soreness that you feel is probably a bad
idea
uh and probably indicative of the fact
that you could be growing more if you
hadn't done what it took
to get that much muscle damage to cause
soreness for example so
it's really worth digging into because
we want the best possible training
without the best possible
recommendations
we want to know as close to the truth as
possible so
first up the correlational evidence
for damage causing growth there is a big
reason why we still consider that damage
and growth have some sort of at least
correlational relationship
which even if there's no causative
relationship we might be able to use
this in auto regulation to inform our
practice
here it is there's a bunch of stuff that
we can do in training
that causes damage and there's a bunch
of stuff that causes muscle growth
as far as we know the intersection of
these
is actually quite high let's take a look
there are at least eight of these things
first of all
using a novel exercise novelty has been
demonstrated a whole bunch to cause new
muscle growth and
bodybuilders have been using it for
years and years and years decades and
decades
that is training stainless we use the
same thing over and over and over again
it probably leads to less and less
muscle growth over time
novelty probably causes more muscle
growth using a novel exercises causes
more muscle damage
for sure so
what's the deal there there's at least a
correlation okay
what is another way to increase the
effectiveness of a training program
increase the load used we also know that
increasing load
it increases muscle damage increasing
relative intensity the closer to failure
you go in any one session the more
muscle growth
you cause but also the more damage you
cause right so starting to get really
really interesting
increasing volume so if you increase
your volume from two sets per session to
four sets per session
you're probably going to get more
hypertrophy uh this has been shown in
almost every study right and you're
probably going to get more muscle damage
so at the very least if we say muscle
damage is absolutely just completely
counter to growth
period any amount of muscle damage more
is less growth
we have a very complex problem here in
the fact that increasing volume
increases growth and increases muscle
damage as well
eccentric loading eccentric loading for
a long time uh you know now we know that
concentric loading also
influences hypertrophy and so does
isometric but eccentric loading
has a pretty decent relationship to
hypertrophy
and it also has a very very close
relationship to generating muscle damage
and generating sores
right there even a lot of programs were
designed back in the 90s
uh people thought that concentric
training didn't grow any muscle which
turns out to be wrong
but it might by itself grow not so much
so they had this uh system of pneumatic
machines
that allowed concentric only action that
promised strength gains without size
gains and it's a bit illusory
but nonetheless it's very pertinent and
those machines are purportedly did not
cause you to become sore
which was true to some extent and also
did not grow you and this is
a little bit ironic there right or not
so certainly coincidental right
uh number six metabolites a nation so if
you submit a lot of metabolites you get
the burn
the burn causes some muscle damage and
some soreness and the burn also
or correlates to and grit correlates to
muscle growth
right and then stretch under tension for
example the way you train your
hamstrings
right when you feel your hamstrings
tensing under a lot of stretch in a
proper stiff like a deadlift
you know you're going to be causing some
muscle damage but you also know you're
going to be growing your hamstrings
if you design a hamstring workout that
does not cause any stretch and retention
you may find yourself without much
hamstring hypertrophy but you're also
going to find yourself
with very little muscle damage so
interesting idea there
and of course targeting the right muscle
by changing technique
right so if you are doing a bunch of pec
flies but you're using for some reason a
lot of front delts and biceps maybe
you're caving in too much with pec flies
at the bottom you're not retracting or
something like that
then and you're not getting sore on your
chest a lot of times you're doing sets
and sets and not getting sore
and not getting much damage and people
are saying hey like you know are you
your pec fly's growing your chest and i
don't think so i don't think it's
improving
then all of a sudden someone's like let
me teach you how to really target your
chest they teach you how to arch or
retract
and really get a mind muscle connection
with your chest or really squeeze at the
top and all of a sudden a couple sets
later you're like oh my god i really
feel my chest getting pumped on this i
really feel like i'm using it what
happens the next day or two days later
you get sore in the chest versus in the
front delts or the biceps like you used
to
so if soreness in a muscle reflects that
you're using it
then maybe that soreness also has
something to do with hypertrophy maybe
maybe something
right another example is uh glute work
and lunges or uh glute bridges if you do
glute bridges improperly you may not get
sworn or glutes or even feel any kind of
damage accumulating not even some
just you know weirdness or some weakness
but if somebody teaches you how to do
glute bridges properly
oh my god these are really hitting my
glutes you get some damage
a day or two later and you probably get
some hypertrophy so
can all of this be coincidence actually
yes it may all be coincidence
or it may be just purely correlation or
not causation at all
but we can't just brush it away so one
of my personal pet peeves which i'm sure
you're not
paying money to see this video for that
dumb shit but i'll throw it in anyway
my pet peeves is when people say they
just go oh
damage has nothing to do with growth
really
right so one challenge i have a
challenge is a stupid word
um intellectual curiosity that i've put
out there into the ether
as broderick chavez would say into the
internet is
you design me a program that for sure
doesn't cause any muscle damage
and you've almost certainly caused
designed a program that causes no muscle
growth
right no novelty in exercise no
increasing in load
relative intensity is low low volume no
eccentric loading or very minimal
no metabolite summation no stretch under
tension are very minimal
and you are actually don't know if
you're targeting the right muscle
because you never feel it in the muscle
so if you have a program that takes
checks all the boxes to make sure to
stay the hell away from damage as far as
possible
you're probably staying the hell away
from growth as much as possible
right so you have a really now some of
the variables not listed here go the
other way and we'll talk about them
later
one of them is higher frequency when you
do higher frequency training you
actually get
less delayed onset muscle soreness right
uh but that also causes more muscle
growth so there is a really interesting
complex relationship we'll get to in a
bit
on the other end of the scale but if
we're just looking at this
if we're saying that there's no
relationship at all with damage and
growth
we're in a real uphill battle and we
certainly probably haven't thought it
through
a whole lot now these correlations are
real interesting
they seem to suggest that potentially
damage may be causing hypertrophy maybe
so why don't we test for it here's a
problem there's a huge lack of direct
evidence
right it's real tempting to conclude the
damage just has to cost growth because
look you know everything that causes
growth causes damage and so on and so
forth
but lack of evidence is a huge problem
there is at least one study
uh the uh the study was brought to my
attention by dr eric helms of 3dmj
in which this is a hilarious study they
physically like like just beat the shit
out of muscle fibers they just deform
the crap out of them they like
they tenderize them uh and they were
living while they did it
and they were trying to see if there was
any downstream muscle growth and it
turns out there wasn't
right so they literally just caused
direct damage maybe it's not
the right kind of damage that sounds
like a bit escapist but maybe
right but there's at least one study to
say that damage without training
saw no growth right and we know that
correlation does not guarantee causation
so it could very well be that volume
represents reps and reserve and all
these other variables that cause muscle
growth
cause damage as a side effect and the
damage itself doesn't
cause growth that's very very possible
so we have to be very skeptical
even though we have these eight
correlates they're just correlates it
could be an association
a correlation and not a causation for
example we can ask the question which
sounds really stupid to us as an analogy
and i guess yeah it would be an analogy
i was going to say it's a homology but
it is actually an analogy
does garbage fuel industrial production
right like in the literal sense that
does garbage just make more stuff like
no god no it doesn't do that at all it's
just fucking garbage
right but if you looked if you were an
alien civilization
and you zoomed in on planet earth and
you studied all the countries you would
say man
the most productive countries generate
the most garbage clearly
garbage is what's causing the most
industrial machinery to be built the
most most coca-cola to be made blah blah
blah
which is not the case economic growth
fuels both the production of industrial
equipment and so on and so forth
and it also fuels as a side effect the
production of garbage
right it's not from a garbage can
coca-cola bottle
that a coca-cola full bottle is made and
delivered to your home so you can drink
it it's the other way around
right so it might be that damage isn't
causing muscle growth
it's that training super hard causes
muscle growth and as a byproduct
causes damage as well just like economic
growth causes industrial production to
go up
and it also causes more garbage to
accumulate but you sure would be laughed
out of an economic conference if you
were like garbage is the key to economic
productivity if we just make more of the
stuff
we're going to be rich which would just
be complete and total nonsense right
may very well be like that for muscle
growth so we don't want to go yelling
about muscle growth being amazing
just yet and it gets worse because there
is some evidence
against muscle growth uh being caused
by damage as a matter of fact some
evidence that damage
goes and causes less growth how the hell
does it do that well first are the
dhammas papers which are now sort of
infamous
they showed that as you trained
at the beginning of a training program
you trained with a high volume and
intensity
you had a high degree of muscle protein
turnover
right muscle protein synthesis was very
high for a while
and uh you also of course these are
beginners so there's tons of muscle
damage going on
and what they actually were successfully
able to do is measure muscle damage in
multiple training sessions while
measuring muscle protein synthesis
and while muscle protein synthesis
stayed relatively the same
damage declined because you're getting
more and more used to the program which
makes sense
right but it turns out that they also
measured uh muscle growth
directly and muscle growth
increased the entire time gee that's
really curious
so it looks like in that study
as you stimulate stimulate stimulate you
get the same amount of muscle
activity going on muscle protein
activity stuff is churning muscle
protein synthesis is happening
but it looks like some of the synthesis
goes to one of two places
into making the muscle bigger adaptation
growth and
into recovering the muscle from damage
and it looks like from that series of
studies
that as the muscle damage was less and
less and less because you get used to it
as you keep training
the amount of muscle protein synthesis
sort of resource left over to fuel
muscle growth is bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger
so it turns out that the correlation
between damage growth was opposite which
actually makes a lot of sense right
that's point number one point number two
it's been commonly observed in a bunch
of studies that beginners don't grow
well in the first weeks
of training and are mega sore like
if anyone of you watching has ever done
research on beginners it's
hilarious because particularly
disgusting
type of hilarious you take people and
you teach them how to do a squat at
session one
and next week that's familiarizations
the session actually won the first
session zero is teach them how to squat
next week they come back for session one
a five by five in the spot they hobble
they crawl out of that workout
they have overlapping muscle soreness
for like the first three weeks of
training
and then they start to get used to it
and interestingly enough you go detect
very little hypertrophy in the first
several weeks of training that might not
be by accident
you might actually be causing so much
damage that there's not enough resource
left over for actual growth
right point number three we have lots of
anecdotal evidence from tons of
bodybuilders
that um super overlapping soreness isn't
conducive to best growth so for example
very rarely we hear a bodybuilder say
yeah
you know i messed i made my best growth
when
by the time i had to train quads next
again my quads were still completely
sore and i got them sore again and they
would just store a sore sword i was sore
for three months straight
as a matter of fact i had a um
interesting discussion back in the day
with john meadows
where he found that some of his best
growth occurred when he stopped doing
that
i was under the false pretense at the
time that damage caused
muscle growth directly and the more the
merrier so i was actually debating him
on that fact but in retrospect
i mean in my own when i made my best
gains i
have had times where i've had
overlapping soreness as a matter of fact
as early as two years ago or as late as
two years ago
i had developed a quadriceps workout
that was just so effective it was like a
pre-exhaust with leg press
and then move on to squats afterwards
and had gotten
access to really good leg press machines
and i was like you know leg pressing is
fun high rep
pumps are fun so i was doing like 100
120 total reps
of leg press and then doing three sets
of you know 10 to 12 in the squat
after i was i had doms for like six days
after each one of those workouts
so my second workout of the week was
under the condition of still being sore
um and then i would barely recover by
next monday and then sort of hit it all
over again
i i did that for like two or three
months
i saw very little performance
improvement and i didn't see any visible
size gains even though that i was
massing
and then later on i tried this a couple
of times juxtaposed with training that
was getting me a little bit sore
but i healed well on time for my next
session and i actually managed two good
sessions in a week not while sore
i got way better gains and i'm not not
the only remotely the only person that's
experienced this
right so there's plenty of anecdotal
evidence you know accounts for what it
counts for not much but something
that super overlapping soreness is not
great so for example if you come up to a
really high level bodybuilder
you say hey listen i'm sore all the time
and i'm not growing why he'll be like
that's your problem right there
right but if you say hey listen i'm sore
all the time i'm doing a good job
a lot of pro bodybuilders say yeah you
know that's good maybe you want to
prepare it back a little bit
eat more food get more sleep so that
you're recovering right
um and question number four is really
just sort of begs the question
if damage linearly causes growth in the
sense that the more damage
you have the more growth you get uh
isn't more damage always better
right and if not then maybe it's too
much to recover from or what is the
situation there because if we're
positing the damage causes muscle growth
uh you know we're in a bit of a pickle
list to explain is why we don't do
you know 50 sets for
uh for a muscle group and then and then
that brings in a whole other line of
evidence uh
from the barbalo group i believe in
brazil
um when they have a a couple of studies
of similar design where
and a bunch of other studies have found
very similar findings where much more
than 10 to 15 sets per session
seems to cause less growth than doing
you know
5 to 15 sets per session so they
compared up to 20 working sets
per session once a week to five to ten
cents per session in fact it
actually grew more muscle and you think
gee you know that 20 cents per second
group got way more damage if damage
caused growth
linearly why the hell are they growing
more right and they have plenty of time
to functionally overreach and everything
it seems that damage might cost growth
as much as it causes it potentially
depending on the dose so
we get into a model to try to explain
all of this
the recovery versus adaptation model
here it is
a couple of things we know training
stimulus
like contraction and the summation of
metabolites inside the muscle so on and
so forth
causes muscle growth to be signaled the
more you train the more it says
grow grow grow grow more stimulus and
more signal means more growth which is
great
okay but more stimulus also comes with
more damage
right either you know it doesn't really
matter if the damage
causes these things more stimulus just
comes with more damage as at least a
side effect
right so when the muscle contracts and
uh there's a ton of calcium flooding in
there a ton of lactic acid
all those ions they break stuff right
and the contraction breaks stuff
so if you train with five sets you get a
certain amount of stimulus
okay and if you train with 10 cents you
get a certain more stimulus but you also
get more damage
and so on and so forth until you get
tons and tons and tons of damage right
when stimulus is high enough you get a
maximum adaptation
right basically shooting the stimulus
even further might not be possible
for whatever reason right but if we keep
stimulating after that point
where adaptation is highest if we keep
adding work and more and more sets for
example
what we might be having is that damage
is now escalating so fast
that we have a certain sum total of
recovery adaptive
ability right and the more we stimulate
the more stimulation we get but once we
reach the top
end of stimulus where the body is
growing as much muscle as it possibly
can
potentially any more stimulus just
causes damage that starts to fill that
bar up for us
so now our body has to make a question
or answer a question
do i want to do some level of growth
uh or do i need to heal from this damage
and characteristically the body almost
always
chooses to heal from damage first before
addressing hypertrophy this is by the
way a very good thing otherwise you
would just get hurt walking up and down
the stairs
if your body just left damage the hell
alone if you train hard enough
there's very much a potential for the
entire bar of recovery
adaptation resource to be used up by
damage and then there's just no resource
left for growth you might not cause
any growth whatsoever you might actually
lose muscle
right so there are three
extremes in which this might happen
perceptively with muscle soreness
here's a really cool chart
that yours truly made with incredible
artistic talent
the recovery versus adaptation model
number one
let's just take a grand tour of this i
promise it's way easier to understand
than it currently looks
so we have these bars
the blue ones are stimulus really you
can see this is just number of sets we
can even say
the first bar on the very left hand side
the beginning of the graph is five sets
then seven sets then nine sets that's
then 11 then 13. just pretend
it's that or something like that right
per session
okay this can even be per week but let's
just say per session
right and it's stimulus however however
you want to think about it but number of
sets is a really really good way to
think about it
so how much stimulus are you imparting
to the muscle itself okay
that's the blue the red is how much
damage comes along with that and we know
that the more
work you do to get a stimulus the more
damage you do just as a super byproduct
right makes perfect sense okay we use
the muscle structures
some degradation occurs some metabolites
go where they're not supposed to they
form methylation products they rip
things off
so on and so forth just apart it's like
you know how many meals does your
kitchen churn out
is it blue and uh how many
or so like how many workers do you have
working in the kitchen making meals
how quickly and the red would be how
much uh gunk
uh and like you know just like refuse
accumulates in the kitchen
uh you know it's basically a linear
relationship or a very very tight
relationship so
that's the red is damage and then we
have growth
based on the recovery versus adaptation
model so if you look
very closely if you take the red damage
and you put it on top of the green
growth what ends up happening is it
equals the blue line exactly
the the blue bar is how much total
stimulus we have
and that's how much recovery adaptation
potential we're working with
if we take that and we split it up some
of it is going to be damaged
some of it is going to be actual
beneficial growth right because the two
fight each other
so in this model model number one
we're basically saying that so let's say
where the green line
peaks okay we're sorry where the green
bar peaks where growth peaks
here it peaks on the third iteration of
this volume
so basically if we have no hint of
soreness the first one
we train no hint of soreness we get a
little bit of damage
plenty of growth okay things are
happening that's really good
but if we train harder we get a small
amount of soreness that lasts for a few
hours or a day
we get more damage but we get so much
more stimulus
that we get a whole lot more muscle
growth okay
and then if we train even harder that we
get moderate soreness that heals well
before the next session
we get a slightly higher net growth
because now our damage is
really getting up there stimulus is
getting up there but our damage is
getting up there as well
number the fourth one from from the
left-hand side of the chart
is an intense soreness that heals just
before the next session that much damage
might actually take up so much of our
recovery adaptive potential
that the green line or the green bar is
now down
right you may actually in this model you
get your best growth
with moderate soreness that heals well
before the next session because that's
the best trade-off
of enough volume to cause lots
and lots of muscle growth or cause lots
and lots of stimulus
but still not so much volume that the
damage starts to get crazy
it's like a kitchen with a worker
capacity
of 35 people if you put 30 people in
there
they do a real good job and it's not
super crowded so the amount of gunk
isn't crazy because people can still
have enough room to clean up after
themselves
and if you put 40 people in that kitchen
they may actually make more meals per
hour
but because they can't get to their
stations to throw away garbage the
garbage just might get really crazy
really fast
so 30 actually beats 40 by a small
margin even though it's less people
same idea here the last one is crazy
soreness that's still around for
the next session that you try it at lots
of stimulus
but the damage is now so excessive that
the growth
is lower by a large fraction this is a
way to get them
this is the hilarious irony of it you do
the most possible work and get the least
possible growth of all of these
super bad ideas this is sort of the
average model
if i had to make a guess this might be a
good guess
for how things work here's another model
potentially how it could work
okay this model same idea stimulus
damage growth as the charts are all the
same labels
but in this one damage and growth
compete
very very fiercely very directly for a
much
smaller recovery adaptive resource so
the first one is when you have no hint
of soreness
you have a little bit of damage and a
plenty of hypertrophy
as soon as you get a small amount of
soreness less a few hours a day
that damage directly starts impeding
hypertrophy
right you get a lot of damage and that
means that
you actually grew less from getting a
little bit of soreness than no hint of
soreness
notice that this might not be wrong
because all the research so far states
that higher frequency training
seems to work better than lower
frequency that certainly aligns with
this high frequency training
doesn't really cause a whole lot of
soreness and it seems to cause a lot of
muscle growth so maybe this
is actually true there's reason to
believe it's not but maybe that has
something to it so
this isn't a model that's so extreme
that we can just rule it out some
version of this may actually be
happening
if we move further to the right moderate
soreness to heals
well before the next session might cause
almost exclusively damage in a very
little growth
right kind of like the dhamma studies
found and then intense soreness the
heels just before the next session
you'll notice the growth bar i just put
it there just for visual reference might
be just
flat okay you're literally basically
causing as much damage
as you have throughput and your recovery
adaptive ability it was just
the only purpose of your training is to
heal damage can you imagine what a giant
fucking waste of time that would be you
train on monday super fucking hard you
get super sore
you heal right before your next session
on thursday and you get super sore again
you hear right before next monday
and four weeks later you got nothing to
show for it right
you know the god of physiology comes out
he's like guess what
you've just been recovering this entire
time and you haven't grown at all you're
like okay that was
stupid as hell right definitely a
possibility physiologically
lastly here in model 2 the very last one
is crazy soreness that's still around
for the next session
might be so much damage that it dips
into
your muscle to actually heal itself and
muscle degrades over time
because there's never enough recovery
adaptation resource to grow any muscle
and natural muscle degradation is just a
part of the process so what ends up
happening is
you may be able to train so hard that
you have more damage
than you have recovery adaptive resource
thus you lose muscle every time you
train like that
holy crap definitely possible definitely
possible probably unlikely
but i wouldn't rule it out all right
model 3
is a little bit more optimistic but that
doesn't mean it's true
so model three says if you have no hint
of soreness
you have very little damage but also
very little growth right this is like
doing like
two sets and saying like ah no damage
but like
okay you would have grown a lot more
from four sets damage aside and that's
something that's been discovered for
sure
number two option here is a small amount
of source lasts a few hours a day
you get a little bit of damage with it
but a lot more growth
on the net balance much more growth
moderate soreness that heals well before
the next session
still more growth a bit more damage but
not a ton
right and then for the fourth uh option
intense soreness the heels just before
the next session might be
some pretty decent damage but the amount
of volume and stimulus might be so great
that
might boost growth to its best ever and
then
only when it's crazy soreness that's
still around for the next session does
damage finally eclipse growth to some
extent
and the growth isn't as high as it was
if you healed on time
here's the deal we have no idea which
one of these models is true
and in various muscles during various
times all of them might be true
right but we can make some implications
for training
based on the fact that the reality very
likely is one or between
some of these models right we don't know
which model is closest to reality one
two or three
but we know a couple things first if you
never get sore okay if
model one is the closest to reality
that's probably not ideal because model
one says that moderate soreness is the
best
target for best growth because that's
where the bar green bar is the highest
okay
if you never get sore if model 2 is the
closest
okay it might be ideal however
you might not be training hard enough to
get your maximum results because you
could train harder and still not get
sore imagine
this you scientists find out that model
2
is reality okay that any hint
of a high degree of uh delayed onset
soreness or any hint of a high degree of
damage
immediately causes uh competition with
adaptation
so your best bet is to train as get as
much stimulus as you can
with as little damage as you can fine
imagine that you're doing
three sets per session you're not
getting sore at all you're ready to go
the next day or the day after no big
deal
is it possible that you are getting your
best gains
yes what if you discovered however one
day you were like you know what i'm
gonna blast it
you do four cents you still don't get
sore and
you still uh recover on time and
everything goes well
okay you didn't get that much more
damage clearly
but almost every study that ever
examines three sets versus four sets or
something analogous to that
finds that more volume causes more
hypertrophy we already know that per
session right and this has been shown up
to right around eight sets per session
so if you never get sore
you could be doing enough to grow
maximum but you could be under doing it
by like one two three four five six sets
or something like that
you could do between that much more sets
and still not getting sore and still
getting best results
right so if model 2 is the closest
you might be ideally training to never
get sore
but it's probably worth pushing it a
little bit just to make sure
because you might be able to squeeze
some more volume and squeeze more
hypertrophy while still not getting sore
all right and of course if model 3 is
the closest it's almost certainly not
ideal
because model 3 has intense soreness to
heal just before the next session as
it's optimal
okay on the other hand so we've covered
the base
of if you're not getting sore at all
it's just unlikely to be the best
possible thing
maybe but even if not getting sword all
is theoretically the best
your current volume you might be able to
do more of it and still not get sore
okay so
so it's definitely worth upping the
volume a little from there
what about if you are always crazy
overlapping sword remember when you're
overlapping sword
is you're saying quads monday and you
train them again on thursday by the time
you get to thursday they're still sore
when you're training them
and when you they get sore again even
more on thursday from the different
exercise or whatever
and by the next monday you're still sore
from last thursday uh okay bad news
maybe
right so if you're always crazy
overlapping sore
if model one is closest if you're always
uh
super sore not ideal has the smallest
green bar of all of them
all right if model 2 is closest you
could actually be losing muscle
okay real bad news and if model 3 is
closest
it's unlikely that you're making your
best gains outside of maybe functional
overreaching but then you have to take
training breaks in between that so maybe
with a very low frequency
something like that can work but
probably not optimally right
so and
lastly another problem with crazy
overlapping soar let's see theoretically
somehow crazy overlapping soreness was
what caused the most hypertrophy
in almost every case when you're crazy
overlapping sore you can't sustain that
kind of performance
very long so maybe you go two weeks
being crazy overlapping sore and you
just get so fatigued your muscles build
up so much fatigue
you cannot produce best overloads
anymore you just get weaker and weaker
and weaker and then you're not even able
to get crazy overlapping sore anymore
right so even if this is the case that
it's the best which it probably isn't
it's just unlikely to be uh performance
sustainable for a long time
maybe slightly easier train per session
is
still better alright so
taking all of that together
programming recommendations first you
don't have to get sore to grow we know
this for a fact because a bunch of
people grow without ever getting sore
okay not up for debate you don't have to
get sort of grown
however if you're not sore
and you're growing you could be growing
more if you did more
and it doesn't matter what the
relationship with soreness and growth is
you might be able to get away with doing
more and still not getting sore
even if soreness is directly any amount
of it that's palpable inhibitory of
growth
right if you're doing three sets per
session and you accidentally do four
and you find that you still haven't
gotten somewhere you do five and you
find that you still haven't gotten sore
five cents per second and four sets
probably grows more muscle than three
so if you're not sore try doing a little
bit more and seeing if your performance
holds
if your performance holds you're
probably going more muscle because
you're doing more volume
awesome right if you're getting on the
other hand crazy sore
and you're getting overlapping soreness
every time you train all of your
sessions
you're very unlikely from a theoretical
basis to be getting your best gains
so reducing the stimulus usually
reducing volume that is
um or pausing the stimulus so if you're
getting overlapping let's say you did
five sets of squats one day and then
five sets of leg presses the next and
you've got overlapping soreness both
times
next week maybe you don't have to go
down to four and four but don't go up to
six and six maybe just stay five and
five for a couple of weeks and
eventually because you know soreness
usually recedes and how powerful it is
as your body adapts
maybe next week you won't get
overlapping soreness anymore the week
after something like that you don't have
to receive necessarily in your training
but at least hold on to it for a second
let your body catch up to you to
probably get the best gains right
it's very likely uh point number four
here
that most the most growth promoting
programs
will likely see you somewhere between
doing as much volume as possible without
getting sore
sort of like in a very high frequency
program and
healing soreness just before the next
workout so when folks ask me hey how
sore should i be getting
i should be i should what i what i
usually say is
if you're not getting sore okay but try
doing more volume until
unless you get sore maybe just do that
much volume until you start to feel it
right or at the very most uh you should
be getting sore to where you healed
completely
uh for your next workout on a regular
basis it's okay every now and again to
have overlapping soreness but if it's
consistent overlapping soreness it's
probably not doing you a whole lot of
good
right we're not sure which in between
those we're not sure which one of those
it is for example
we're not sure if no hint of soreness is
best if a small amount of soreness lasts
a few hours or
a few days is best moderate source of
heals well before the next session is
best
or intense soreness that heals just
before the next session
is best you know it's probably not best
to do super crazy overlapping soreness
and probably not best
to assume that because you're not
getting sore you're getting the best
results
probably try increasing the volume to
see if you can still not get sore at the
very least
but also do more volume right because
think of this nightmare scenario you're
doing two sets of five and you're like
i'm not getting sore i'm growing and
someone's like okay
how do you know you're growing you know
you never get sore you say well sources
have anything to do with growth
all right why don't you try four sets of
five and you do it you still don't get
sore and you're like i'm growing even
more
like okay well i thought you were going
the most when you were doing two by five
like
well i guess i could do more well why
don't you keep going
until you get sore when you get sore you
can say if you're really convinced
soreness is
let's say you convince soreness just
harms growth like crazy you know let's
say you find it seven sets of five you
start to get sore
well just stop your program at six but
certainly don't stop at two sets of five
that would make no damn sense at all
right so we're not sure where in between
these nuances uh
and it could be muscle group specific it
could be individual specific however
three recommendations don't not get sore
and just assume you're training hard
enough if you're not getting sore in
your programs
it might be worth exploring an increase
in volume so long as you're watching
your performance
if your performance is stable or
increasing as you go up in volume and
you're not getting sore you're almost
almost certainly growing more and more
and more the more volume you do
that half of my career on that right
on the other hand don't get super duper
sore and assume you're getting the best
games people do this shit all the time
smash my packs 20 sets i couldn't move
my chest i couldn't brush my teeth
the day after i'm getting mega swole
like nah or you're just healing damage
or barely healing or not even healing
enough of it
to cost you some muscle growth maybe
that's not the best idea
however i think at the end of the day
performance stability
over an accumulation phase is critical
so as you do an accumulation phase as a
mesocycle for hypertrophy you do more
more volume and intensity and get closer
and closer to failure
your fatigue is going to go up right and
your uh adaptation your muscle growth
and so on and so forth your fitness
is also going to go up if your
performance
is relatively the same the entire time
that almost guarantees that your fitness
is going up
because how the hell can your
performance be the same if your fatigue
is going up
right it has to mean fitness is
improving if your performance is going
up a little bit
that's totally cool but it could be that
you know you're just not doing enough
volume to if you did more volume you'd
accumulate more fatigue yes which would
make your performance flat line
but more volume accumulated might
actually mean that you're
causing more muscle growth maybe not
causing more strength but definitely
more muscle growth in the short term
when you deload after an accumulation
phase all that fatigue is gone
your muscles are bigger you're at a
higher performance plateau and you
repeat
what you don't want to do is have your
performance fall the entire time that
means you're almost certainly training
too much
or have your performance just skyrocket
the entire time while doing super low
volumes because that's a peaking program
and not a hypertrophy program so you
should be looking for soreness aside
is just make sure your program involves
either a maintained performance ability
through the accumulation phase
motorcycle as you do more and more
or a slightly increasing performance
ability i think both of those are really
good options if your performance is just
skyrocketing up
you have to wonder why you're not doing
more sets to cause more fatigue to cause
more muscle growth right
on the other hand for performance is
falling well you're just shooting
overload right in the foot and that's
not a sustainable way to train
for any length of time which way of
getting sore is best
anything between doing as much volume as
you possibly can without getting sore
to potentially all the way healing just
before the next session
but not doing hardly any volume not
being sore and being like ah this is
great i'm growing like a weed
probably that idea it's probably a bad
idea to get so sore that you never
really recovered and you're always so
all the time
give that some thought folks next time
we chat
it is going to be about rest times
between
sets we are we have solved the rest time
problem with a really neat four-step
algorithm that you can use
to make money at home i'm just kidding i
always wanted to say that on tv
folks talk to you next time
