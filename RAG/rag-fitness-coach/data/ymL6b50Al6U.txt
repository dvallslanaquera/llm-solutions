hey folks it's me dr mike welcome to the
targeting the muscle series how do we
feel the target muscle more and get it
hit more and stimulate it more and grow
more
from drumroll stiff-legged deadlift the
target is elle hamstrings as the french
say french viewers i'm sorry to mature
language
how do we do it
[Music]
the first tip we have
is to arch your lower back
so
what does that mean
yes
you could do a stiff legged deadlift
just by bending over and coming back up
but what we want is to make the sniff
like a deadlift very limited by the
hamstrings
so that we don't have to do as much
bending as would be required if we
didn't pre-stretch the hamstrings so
we're going to do here is take our
position
and before starting we arch the lower
back it's not the lower back arching we
want it's the tilting of the pelvis
anteriorly we have the posterior tilt we
have the anterior tilt and if we tilt
anteriorly it pre-stretches our
hamstrings
such that when we tilt anteriorly and
then we begin to descend you very
shortly i'm already feeling it feel a
deep painful stretch in the hamstrings
that's amazing that's what we want what
we don't want is to round our back and
go down because right now i still don't
feel my hamstrings and i don't feel them
and already hit rock bottom
so what you want to do is arch your back
nice and tight not the whole thing you
don't have to keep your chest super sky
high you can if you want but really it's
that pushing the butt back
arching that lower back and then
starting to descend and making sure that
as you descend your back doesn't round
over as you descend you are still
keeping that back arch and you'll feel
instantly the tension hamstrings go down
his knee wow
and then come back up
folks question why do i have one of my
uh pant legs rolled up
because i'm in a gang but the other
reason is because i want to demonstrate
super important feature of stiff legged
deadlifts to actually hit the hamstrings
it is keeping the knee straight
keeping it from bending remember that
the hamstring crosses two joints the hip
joint
and the knee joint so if we do our first
tip and arch nice and hard
we can make sure that the hamstrings are
nice and tight because we've
pre-stretched at the hip
but as we go down if we bend our knees
which is super tempting because it lets
you lift more weight it feels less bad
what ends up happening is all of
the length we generated the hamstrings
at the hip
is
gotten rid of at the knee because the
hamstring shortens there and then we go
down nice and low and not feel diddly
dick
what we have to do is have an athletic
posture for the knee
you don't want to lock it out because
that can be a little iffy
just shy of lockout pretty straight
knees and then as you are moving your
hips back and bending at the hips you
want to make sure your knees are not
going forward so you want to keep the
knees back and that's the cue his knees
back knees back knees back and oh i
can already tell there's a ton of
tension in my hamstring if i do this the
tension goes away we don't want it to go
away want to stay so keeping the knees
back and lower back arched if you could
do both at the same time
that are right there those are the two
biggest cues for the hamstring
but they're not the only ones we have
more
next tip for feeling your hamstrings a
lot of course the two fundamental tips
we've already gone over are arching the
lower back
and keeping the knees stable keeping
them from tracking forward
arching the lower back can be tough in
the sense that proprioceptively your
body's awareness of where it is in space
for some of us less athletically
challenged people it can be tough to
figure out if that's actually going on
there's a lot of load who the knows
what's going on one easy cue you can use
and you don't have to use it but it can
be helpful for many people is chest up
especially at the bottom of the lift
when we do stuff like a deadlift if
we're trying to do a good job sometimes
we're doing a fine job but then our
chest starts to forward our backgrounds
tension is no longer in the hams it's
now in the lower back not a bad thing
but great lower back exercise not so
good for the hams so what we want to do
is as we are moving
back and as we are to quote jared
feather pointing our butthole up into
the sky
keeping our knees back it could also
help us to remind ourselves at the
bottom
chest up chest up chest up chest up
because you're keeping your chest up
instead of down
your back can stay flat the tension is
in the hams and all good things occur
just like that
[Music]
all right now that your technique is
really set in
a big thing is the stiff leg deadlift
hits the hamstrings fundamentally
primarily by milking the eccentric
stretch and it's very difficult to do
that if you're descending very quickly
so my recommendation to you if you
really have trouble feeling your
hamstrings
arch that lower back keep the chest up
keep the knees nice and straight and as
you descend go slow
one
two
three
four
five
up coming up fast is awesome no big deal
and then again descend slow
knees back chest up tummy out
and up again
that slowness is going to make sure of
two things
one you're applying eccentric overload
while you're not just skipping it by
going down really fast
two at every moment
at every second you can ask yourself am
i feeling the tension through the hams
through a painful stretch if the answer
is no you go oh that's right
because my knees came forward you push
them back and you go oh now i feel it by
taking it slow on every rep we can
correct the rep internally inside that
wrap and making sure every rep is
quality
next tip very related kind of bringing
all the other tips together is constant
internal cueing yes you can remember
these things
before you start and then do them and
after watch your video i up i
didn't do chest up
so what i like to do
is use three cues
knees back
chest up oops
tummy out
tummy out i'm still nice and tight but i
push my tummy out that directly allows
me to arch my lower back
i repeat those three cues in my head to
myself as i go
okay
tummy out chest up knees back am i still
doing it yes
chest up tummy out knees back yes
the entire time tummy out knees back
chest up boom
because under a crazy amount of load
or under crazy fatigue it can be easy
to forget one or two of those cues and
the way this system works
is that your back needs to be a rigid
body and your low your whole leg needs
to be a rigid body that's how the
hamstrings work best if you forget to do
one of those things if you droop your
chest a lot if you let your tummy droop
down if you push your knees forward that
system breaks down not in a bad way just
in a way that you're not really training
your hamstrings much anymore so constant
repetition of those cues is its own tip
because most of the time in many
exercises while you're doing the
movement
you're just kind of settling in there
and doing stuff you may cure yourself
beforehand and the movement occurs so
fast maybe between reps or a couple
times during the set you'll cue with the
hamstrings you can internally cue during
every single rep if you need the help it
works super super great
[Music]
the last tip is to find your best depth
it's a little bit tricky to find because
it is the confluence of two things
happening at the same time
thing number one
is you are going sufficiently deep
to stretch your hamstrings painfully you
guys will notice my arms are like this
it's just a reflex from pulling they can
be like that's totally fine so if your
hamstrings are still stretched that's
awesome painful stretch is good
the second thing is if you go low enough
your hamstrings can still feel like
they're stretching but a little less and
then you start moving at the back
and your knees come forward so yes more
depth is good
point one
but only when your hamstrings are the
limiting factor and being painfully
stretched all the way through
if you go down so low that your pain is
maximum you're doing good
as soon as you descend a little lower
and you're like oh that's actually easy
arm hamstrings come up remember that
depth go down again and hit that depth
where the pain is maximum
as soon as you're not stretching the
hamstrings painfully anymore that means
they're probably not the main factor
they're not taking a ton of stimulus you
may notice that if you go deeper in
stiff legged deadlifts you actually get
less sore on the hamstrings than if you
go shallower but keep the tension on the
hamstrings this is one of those things
where
active range of motion is actually a
valid concept and total super duper full
range of motion may no longer target the
muscle so as long as you're feeling
painful tension on the hamstrings and
you're not using other parts or other
joints to make up the range of motion
you're doing super well for yourself
folks that's all the tips the next time
i see you your hamstrings better take up
worlds and entire civilizations will
collapse at the mere thought of your
hamstrings
