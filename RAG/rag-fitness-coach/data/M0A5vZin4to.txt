stop squatting for hamstring growth
several studies now have measured
hamstring growth after squats and well
they just don't grow while the
hamstrings do extend the hip they also
Flex the knee so they have opposing
functions at Two Joints during the squat
so if the hamstrings were to contribute
during the squat they would actually
make the job of the quadricep muscles to
extend the knee more difficult so if you
want to train your hamstrings don't
squat do something like leg curls or
rdls or good mornings instead
