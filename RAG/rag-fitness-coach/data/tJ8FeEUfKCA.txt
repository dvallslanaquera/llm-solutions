one more time i'm right here with you
take a break rest breathe
whenever you're ready one good one
no rush
yo
it's thursday we have two workouts today
but the first walkout happens right now
leg training holy crap we got hamstrings
we got quads and then we have more quads
charlie jung
mike is ratel jared father who will be
acting in a coaching capacity today and
giving you all kinds of really cool cues
and by giving you cues and you get to
hear the cues he gives to mr dom
trivellini
right that's right i got it fucking
right i got yo hey dom what are you
doing here fucking up anyway
all ethnic stereotypes about italians
aside we're gonna crush it this is dom's
first shot at an rp leg workout
i'm
dom's family i apologize for what he's
gonna go through the rest of you let's
tune in let's have fun and let's uh
destroy destroy
back knee straight back back back back
back
yeah touch all the way down get that
depth
big chest the whole time butt back butt
back dog back big
good enough
whenever you're just kind of like in one
position here and you're reaching
forward it's a lot more erector yeah so
we're really trying to target the
hamstrings glutes so you're really
trying to push those hips back
instead of reaching forward
because i get a lot of range of motion
out of this obviously this is pretty
easy but once you start pushing those
hips back
it gets a little harder okay what's up
guys so the first exercise today is
going to be the hip hinge exercises
today because a lot of people get lower
back pumps quads really tired doing a
hip hinge after you do a bunch of quad
work is going to be very hard especially
leg press we have camera bar squats or a
goblet squat of some sort on the on the
dusting bar so it's going to be
tough to go into a hip hinge after that
that if you insert those first you get a
bunch of hip hinge volume in don't you
target the hamstrings a ton and then go
to your quad work your lesser compound
quad work for this second leg day of the
week
[Music]
[Applause]

beautiful dom the biggest cheat sheet
here for you
is during the rep especially on the way
down at the bottom
which technique makes your hamstrings
hurt the most by pulling them apart
whatever that is is the best technique

i've been doing leg press this entire
mesocycle i'm including i know all my
sets all my wrecks that i have to do the
technique is there my muscle is there

charlie has been doing the belt squat
this entire time
and it's the identical machine the matte
wedding belt squat which is oh my oh
fucking beautiful machine
charlie's going to do that because
variation two and a half weeks out for
him for his bodybuilding show no bueno
dom is going to join charlie because
he's already used the arsenal leg press
which is amazing
but he has never used the belt squad
matt wedding bell squad
and charlie is going to set the pace
annihilation will occur
let's get it done after that we'll
finish with some spots

brutal maya reps
now we're finishing up with
chris stuffins
amazing transformer bar
safety squat bar setting
over the last couple weeks i've been
working in the mid 300s but i'm
g
less than a week and a half out for my
show
and uh under the guidance of jared
father here
um we're lowering my weight to 275 from
the mid threes just three sets of ten
get in the volume
and make sure that there's minimum
minimum risk of injury pushing it hard
this close to a show
is somewhere between a good idea and a
stupid idea we're gonna decide on the uh
air on the the good side here the volume
is the same probably more mathematical
volume
but uh not as heavy of a weight because
shit's getting real
charlie's all done all he needed was a
few sets of belt squats he had all his
volume landmarks so he's resting now
dom and i are gonna have some fun and
get this done all right gucci
i think 10 i don't even know my quads

workout jared's here i'm here and
character switch we're going to be
training biceps because there's only one
muscle in the body it's right here and
if you don't have it who cares into the
bodybuilder jared what's your best body
part is it your bicep no then what the
fuck are you doing in the sport taking
eighth place eighth place that's
pathetic you know one time my
grandmother entered my first
bodybuilding show which i won and she
took eight no i'm just kidding i'm sorry
it doesn't mean she took seven three
nine nine all right first step cable
curls we're going to do this and then
match with the cable
and then uh
one arm laterals unless jared is like no
that's stupid we're doing something else
when i'm laterals
let's get it done that's pretty stupid
i like
[Music]
arm's looking big
fuck
good shit
oh yeah
christ
hey folks
mike here with charlie and jared team
full rom
talking about contest bodybuilding
trying to share some stories some
experiences
maybe connect with you guys on a more
personal level we're going to be talking
about our own biggest challenges in the
prep process and maybe if you guys want
to comment some of your own challenges
and your own dieting and your own prep
we can get a conversation going in the
comments
basically guys my question to you and
i'll answer this as well
is what are your biggest challenges
during prep here are some sort of seeded
little seed variables to grow on
s is it self-doubt is it fear of injury
i'm definitely a little scared of injury
as i get closer to the show
uh
does the work ever scare you do you ever
look at a prep and think fuck
16 weeks of this shit or does the hunger
scare you because hunger's kind of scary
like it's like i don't want to feel
miserable for days on weeks and months
on end
i would definitely say i put a lot a lot
of pressure on myself to do better than
i did
i think
hindsight it was stupid obviously why um
just because you know everything we
talked about you can only do your best
and
no matter what the stage is always there
and the only thing i'm there to do is
make more improvements and
and
preach science and show people how you
can do things more intelligently and not
get hurt and do it so you don't have to
be miserable and just implement
different strategies
according to sports science and just
dieting priorities so that way you're
actually
just enjoying the process and not like
like i said it's like bodybuilders seem
to be so miserable historically because
they think all you have to do is go hard
as shit and eat chicken and broccoli
there's a valorization of misery yeah
it's almost like yes
it's valorization exactly yeah
suffer more and and then they're like
happy about that but at the same time
they're just dickheads through the
entire day and it's like
suffering more doesn't mean shit like
showing up in shape means shit
and most the guys that i know that are
the best that show up in shape they're
the happiest through the prep yes and
they the happiest through the prep means
their fatigue is lower exactly because
suffering literally psychological
suffering adds fatigue yeah and the
things you push there is such a thing as
pushing yourself too hard yeah because
guys will usually say like yeah come on
man push it like what the fuck you think
i'm doing already you think i'm fucking
picking flowers on my days off and
eating burritos the fuck out of my face
what if i'm pushing appropriately hard
one of my least favorite quotes ever
our coaches in wrestling used to say
they would say like outwork your
opponent like what if your opponent's
already going above his maximum
recoverable loss exactly he's supposed
to be that idiot that goes even further
exactly
charlie
hit us
what do we got as far as a couple ladies
really for you
self-doubt you run on self-doubt
yeah i mean it's all a little bit but
you're okay with it yeah it doesn't
bother me it's never told you self-doubt
was bad thing
yeah it's uh i feel like it's uh
part of the reason why i am in the
position of i am a lot of things that
explain
what explain that oh like because
if you don't believe your own shit
then uh you're always trying to
you know do better be better and
i feel like that you know imposter
syndrome whatever you want to call it
this helped me kind of
get to where i am at this point in life
so you don't have a high opinion of
yourself and you're struggling to
improve that opinion and that's what
drives some of your work effort yeah
has it been working has your opinion of
yourself been improving
i can answer that for you it hasn't
but you've been improving which is nice
but on paper objectives
on paper i know that i'm improving you
know that but you don't feel it in your
heart yeah but then if i do it might end
by
you think so maybe who knows the only
thing that i guess
i'm uncomfortable with during prep
is that in conjunction with
disappointing people around me
and not doing my best sure
you know i'll just be straight up
i'm jewish
and some of us have been known to have
radically high anxiety as the show nears
fatigue rises
calories drop supplements increase
and the biggest thing i struggle with is
anxiety
and it's this completely chemically
induced state because it is never
logical my logical mind never leaves i
know anxiety is always a stupid
pointless emotion
but i experience it in heavy heavy waves
and it's awful i'm getting better at it
because
i'm uh
doing i always do a lot of work on
myself a lot of mindfulness work jared
does that type of fucking lame shit too
and um one of the cool things is i
learned so much about myself and i
learned so many mental strategies during
that time of more supplement use before
the show
while experiencing anxiety is almost
like when dropped into a deep pool you
really learn how to swim if you don't
drown um i learn how to swim better in
my anxiety all the time so when i'm not
in prep and if i'm in prep next time i
have all this huge unreal toolbox of
anti-anxiety stuff
and for me show competition prep is a
huge avenue for personal growth to be
completely honest painful painful
fucking personal growth
yes
[Music]
