hey folks
dr mike gertel here for renaissance
production rp plus continuing
hypertrophy concepts and tools
advanced lecture number 26
long-term athlete development talking
here about how
training age how long you've been
training for alters the application of
each one
of the seven scientific principles of
hypertrophy training
just to be clear we're going to be using
delineations that are a little bit
arbitrary
beginner intermediate advanced and
roughly
a beginner someone has been training for
about zero to three years intermediate
roughly three to seven years in advance
someone who's been consistently training
for seven
or more years a better way to conceive
of this
because people uh change and alter
and differ based on what
for one person may be beginner for
another person may already be an
intermediate after several number of
years
there's actually a little bit more of an
objective scale here
a beginner is someone that makes easy
gains with
only the basics in place like you're
lifting weights and you're getting
plenty of food and rest
you just make awesome gains you don't
hit any plateaus that's a beginner
if you're still doing that you're a
beginner no matter how long you've been
training there are people who turn pro
basically as beginners and they gain
another 40 pounds after they turn from
intermediates can be defined as
essentially when first hit plateaus
without due diligence to some specifics
essentially you've been doing the basics
but now just the basics of lifting heavy
and sort of resting and eating you hit
your first plateau and you got to do
some thinking
if you haven't hit your first plateau
you're a beginner as soon as you've hit
your first plateau
you're intermediate and some more
plateaus will probably come up now and
again
but as long as you do pretty well and
stay diligent the plateaus come and go
and you solve them relatively easily and
you continue to make very good gains
you are advanced when you don't get any
notable gains unless the details are in
place
you are advanced when you can no longer
just use every exercise and they're all
not interchangeable
and the gains don't just come even if
you do a good job not only do you have
to do a great job you have to do a very
specific job
and the gains are very very slow so just
to rephrase beginner is when
it's you just do the basics and you grow
no problem intermediate is when you
start to hit some road bumps for the
first time you hit some plateaus and you
have to sort of refine your
program and then advanced is when you're
doing a program that's anything but
refined you essentially make no gains
so really really really big deal here
those are the three big differences
how do we train these folks differently
throughout
their careers how do beginners apply
specificity
differently than intermediate supply
specificity than advanced supply
specificity
and so on and so forth with overload and
all of the other training principles
let's find out so specificity
beginners should apply this principle
by essentially having the goal of
learning
stable technique on the free weight
basics mostly
and ingraining it so that it's
essentially automatic a very good
technique that occurs automatically that
takes
time but that is the foundation
that on which every other part of your
physique training will be built
once it is there and also for beginners
because they usually have
very high sensitivities to hypertrophy
and they need muscle everywhere
doing the compound freeway basics and
learning the technique really well
not only keeps you really safe but works
really really well to gain a ton a ton
of muscle
intermediates should already have a good
handle
on the technique for the basic free
weight movements like squats
and presses and rowing and vertical
pulling and upright rows and so on and
so forth and
they should usually be focusing on if
they want this is by the way for maximum
muscle development
if you have goals of like i just want to
put on 15 pounds and mostly just have
big arms
some of this doesn't apply to you but to
get your all-time biggest at the end of
10 or 15 or 20 years of training
this is the progression and if you're an
intermediate in that progression
you should probably focusing on putting
tons of muscle on your biggest muscle
groups
because remember once you get advanced
you may be carrying some injuries
your systemic mrv may limit your ability
to train
really big muscle groups really hard so
if you're an advanced lifter
and all of a sudden you got to bring up
your back or your legs or your chest and
shoulders
god that's a big task and you may be be
too beat up to do it
but if you are an intermediate as an
intermediate you really beef up your
back
your legs your push complex and your and
your
larger muscle groups then
getting slightly bigger biceps getting
slightly bigger forms getting slightly
bigger calves
that is not a huge insurmountable task
and you can always do that as an
advanced person so it's kind of like
a priority list that you write for your
daily to-do list for something or a
weekly to-do list is like put the big
rocks in first like must go to work
must go to school must eat my meals must
pick up my daughter at 3 p.m
after that like what exact episode you
know of altered carbon you're gonna
watch on netflix is a small rock that
you can always figure out later
right just the same way beginners
should have really good technique set in
and then that will power
their development of the larger muscle
groups and or they ones they want to
prioritize a ton
to eventually have the biggest first
that's the best way to go about it
and on the specificity front beginners
should just be concentrating on
technique while intermediates should now
be training
with higher and higher relative efforts
to get closer and closer to their true
rir because that will come in handy
later
and then advanced individuals
are going to be focusing more on
bringing up lagging body parts
specifically smaller ones when you look
at the training logs and
uh sort of training advice that pros
give
almost all of their routines are around
bringing up xyz i got to bring up my
shoulders i got to bring up my back i
gotta bring up my
you know biceps or my triceps or they
usually don't even say back they say
like i gotta bring up my outer lats you
know versus like the inner part of the
back which could already be very big
rarely are they like you know i just
need like bigger everything they say
that sometimes but
a lot of times they've already taken
care of that part and when you're
reading pro advice to be like i gotta
bring up my side delts you might not be
as a beginner intermediate in that
position you might just need
bigger delts period and bigger
everything so you might not relate and
that's okay because
folks have different priorities advanced
people need to bring up smaller groups
because hypothetically they've already
done a good job on the basics
and advanced lifters
need to really start working on the mind
muscle connection and honing it in
why beginners have to have a really good
stable technique
because if your technique sucks pushing
close to failure
leads into higher injury risk and
probably no more stimulus to the actual
muscle
because as your technique sucks more and
more and more as you go closer and
closer to failure
you stimulate the target muscle less and
less and less in this peripheral
the uh so fatigue spills over to more
and more other muscles in the system
that you don't need to
so first as a beginner by the time
you're a beginner you have great
technique
now that you have great technique and it
doesn't break down as you get closer to
failure
now it's time to push things closer to
failure and learn how close to failure
you can actually push what really is
zero reps in reserve what really is
failure
now you know how to train well and you
know how to train hard as an advanced
you already know how to train hard
remember the mind muscle connection as
we define it here isn't just perceiving
that your muscles are firing that's just
being
awake and moving around it is the
perception of a
high degree of tension and or a
perception of a metabolite burn
in the muscle that you're targeting
during a hard set
if you don't know how to do a heart set
from being an intermediate the mind
muscle connection is something you won't
actually be able to detect as an
advanced learn the technique as a
beginner
as an intermediate you're going to learn
how to train hard
and then as an advanced uh bodybuilder
or lifter or anything
you're going to learn how to take that
hard training and focus it into the
muscles that you want
by then you already be super jacked but
that ability to focus
is built on having good technique and
being able to train hard now which you
have layered on top of each other it's
like a skyscraper
and then now that you can do the mind
muscle connection it comes at a really
good time because it's going to improve
your stimulus to fatigue ratio just when
you need it
so that's the progression there on
specifics so if you're a beginner
and someone's like what you really need
to do is focus on mind muscle connection
wrong you need to focus on having really
good technique externally perceived
technique are you squatting deep enough
is your backstreet
are you on your heels things like that
intermediates
shouldn't be focusing on the mind muscle
connection yet because the mind muscle
connection requires you to push hard
you don't know how to push hard yet and
as a beginner you don't want to learn
how to push hard we'll get to that a
bit later for other reasons because your
technique will break down if you push
too hard then you're pushing hard doing
god knows what
so as an intermediate you have to take
your very good technique keep it very
good
of course you'll improve it a little bit
and learn how to milk out
sets hard so basically
here's how the progression looks for the
example of squatting as a beginner you
learn how to squat
and you tweak your squat technique until
externally perceived when you hit your
intermediate phase
your squat looks good so that's a five
to ten in the squat
look great up and down you look like an
olympic weight lifter awesome check
yeah as an intermediate you're gonna
take your squat and you're gonna get
stronger and stronger stronger on it
and you're gonna push steps closer and
closer to failure
as an immediate you're gonna think you
have four rir and you're gonna discover
you really have six rar stuff like that
over and over and over
so by the end of the intermediate phase
you know how to get on the squat and not
only do great technique
all the way through the set but your set
can be taken to the fires of hell
you're really pushing it and then as an
advanced
lifter you are going to alter your
expression of your technique just a
little bit
and push hard while detecting are my
quads what are pushing me
are my quads is where the tension is
through are my quads accumulating the
lactic acid
and you're going to be aware of that
during the set and between sets
so that every set hits your quads that
much more
with the fire of a thousand suns you
learned as an intermediate
through the great technique you
establish as a beginner
this is career length periodization in
bodybuilding
i'm probably the first person to ever
talk about this as far as i know
how fucking egotistical is that give
that some thought camera guy's laughing
next up overload how is overload
different between beginners and
immediate advanced beginners
should stay away from anything less than
two ir very close to failure is not good
and only progress in load and or reps
and or sets
when technique is stable so if someone
progressed to a new squat weight and at
this new weight this week their
techniques kind of oh it's kind of heavy
they're kind of tipping forward
next week you do not add weight and you
do not have reps and you do not add sets
you have them repeat what they did and
because they adapt so quickly as a
beginner this shouldn't be something you
do very often
rather it should be a very quickly
solved problem you repeat what they did
and you say listen technique technique
technique and they all got it
and they execute excellent technique and
then they've checked all the boxes of
okay techniques stable and they seem to
have
plenty of reps in reserve time to do
more
only when they demonstrate that their
technique is stable
and they're two reps in reserve away
from failure at least
and load additions can be large if and
only if technique is good and most of
the training should be in the 5 to 10
rep range why
because in the 5-10 rep range it is
enough reps to get you lots of practice
to learn the movements well
but not so many reps that you get
fatigued in the set
of actually doing the same technique and
that fatigue starts to really rub into
you
and your technique breaks down go
telling someone to do 20 perfect
technique reps in a row
holy shit by the time they get to 15
they're like i just want to be done with
this and they're just pushing the bar
so beginners the focus is on staying
away from failure
only progressing when your technique is
good but potentially jumping
large amounts of progression because the
adaptations at that rate are very very
fast
for intermediates you're going to do
more of training in the 10 to 20 rep
range
because your technique is very stable
now and
like from the last side you're going to
be going to you're going to begin to
push closer to failure
more often so uh a beginner may start at
6 rar and end the mesocycle at 2 rir
before deloading an intermediate may
start at three or four ir and end
actually at zero r okay now it's normal
training
and the progress in load and sets and so
on and so forth is by the normal
algorithms described earlier in this
uh in this series so nothing too crazy
no exceptions like we make for beginners
whether they have to be stabilized a
technique to keep going
why because you should be stabilized
technique anyway
advanced will often train entire
accumulation phases between 0 and 2 r
advanced may start to rer because
nothing less stimulates any muscle
growth potentially
in their case it's just all junk volume
yeah that sucks but it's part of being
advanced
this is why a lot of high-level
bodybuilders train very close to failure
very often because
for them something less may not work
much at all whereas for someone just
beginning if they're six rar they grow
unbelievable amounts of muscle for years
and years and years
load progressions and rep progressions
can be very small even not every micro
a very common question is how much
weight do i add per week to an advanced
lifter that may not even be a terrible
question it'd be like okay
i add two and a half pounds this week
next week i keep it the same
and then the next week after i had two
and a half pounds maybe
functional overreaching of muscle groups
might be needed to get their best
results it might not be good enough to
just do stifling and deadlifts and good
mornings
or stifling the lifts and leg curls
twice a week for four sets
in the hamstrings and see consistent
growth you might need to do
five sets six sets seven sets for each
one per week and by seven you're trash
and you're functionally overreaching a
huge recession
big deload maybe even get away from
training hams for a few weeks very hard
after that
and then the super compensation occurs
and you make great gains you essentially
have to do a deeper foray into
the zone of difficulty and then pull
back for longer and further
because of the accumulated fatigue it
may be the only way to go about it
beginners have it easy
they produce a tiny stimulus almost no
fatigue and they get great gains
an advanced person has to produce a ton
of stimulus pay the huge fatigue cost
wait till it wears off
repeat it and come back in advanced
folks will lift usually with the highest
volumes
oftentimes with the highest numbers of
sets but definitely highest mathematical
volumes
times times weight times distance the
lightest average loads
which means that they lift the heaviest
weights totally but they do a
more of their percentage of training in
the 20 to 30 rep range and a bigger
percent in the 10 to 20
than all the other folks and they might
lift not so much in the 5 to 10 rep
range and now you know why a lot of
videos or pro bodybuilders that you've
seen
look like they do and they might do
closer to failure than everyone else
so that's if you're looking at what
should beginner training look like
it should look like not a ton but plenty
of sets of five to ten on the compound
heavy basics not anywhere close to
failure learning good technique
for advanced that should look like tons
and tons of volume
often with higher reps pushing every set
very close to failure
very different kind of training which is
to say individualization is important at
least and we'll talk about this in the
summary slightly later
you cannot apply the same paradigms to
everybody else if you have a beginner
training like a pro
it's just not going to be the optimal
outcome especially for long-term
development
even though they may make great gains
during that time
fatigue management because we don't want
technique to break down
and we don't want learning to occur of
technique that is the wrong kind
because unlearning bad technique is
actually very very difficult we want to
get beginners to stop at roughly
two-thirds of their mrv
how do we know that it's when technique
starts to break down from the sheer
amount of volume
so if they're your lifters are still
progressing and they almost certainly
will be
but they're like ooh and i'm really
tired and their techniques starting to
not look so great
after a certain hard week of training
and more volume cut them off
deload them recycle repeat there's no
need to push it
because they get great gains without it
and they don't have to pay the cost
interestingly enough technique
is more sensitive to fatigue than
strength
or endurance or capacity in any of those
and definitely muscle size
so when your technique starts to go it's
what we call
an early indicator of a high level of
fatigue
okay we have an article on juggernaut
strength called
uh one is called fatigue and its causes
and there's another article
on the time courses of fatigue like
detecting fatigue
and essentially what are called leading
indicators of fatigue or ones that
uh detect fatigue very early before it's
relevant
and technical breakdown in beginners is
one of them
beginners are not at their mrv when
their technique starts to break down
at all not even close they're a third of
the way from mrvs
or so but when it starts to break down
can they continue to go with crappy
technique gain tons of more muscle
absolutely but it's not a good idea
because we want them to learn good
technique
and we don't get them hurt so on and so
forth
intermediates for fatigue management
really need to start paying attention
to sfr moves that are very high
so juxtaposing that with beginners they
can focus
on really high raw stimulus magnitude
moves you can have a beginner do
you know six sets of 10 in the deadlift
they recover just fine
because their total ability to disrupt
their relatively small muscles
is not ever pushing into systemic rv
range
it's fine for them to do really high
rust stimulus magnetic exercises get a
lot out of them and
coincidentally luckily those are the
same exercises that are the compound
heavy basics that they need to be
practicing anyway
right an intermediate really needs to
start thinking about stimulus to fatigue
ratio
um because raw stimulus magnitude might
not be worth it
uh for for some movements like
intermediates may
absolutely be pushing it hard on squats
and presses and pulls uh you know like
rows and
vertical pulling but uh deadlifts for
sets of five to ten
uh just might not be the exercise of
choice anymore for intermediates
because the roster miss magnitude is
great uh that's probably more for
beginners for intermediates the
stiffness to fatigue ratio
it's a little bit more important so
instead of doing deadlifts they might do
some deficit sumo deadlifting
for more of the glute's lower body they
might do stiff-legged deadlifting
for the hamstrings glutes and erectors
and they might be doing some bent over
rowing and various selection rows
for the uh horizontal pulling
musculature of the back
instead of just doing the deadlift
because all those moves combined could
be better stimulus to fatigue ratio than
just
conventional deadlifts from the ground
advanced lifters
need to be managing fatigue by focusing
on
only the highest sfr moves there are
exercises which advanced lifters will
only do very late
in their uh daily session like they
might only squat last or second to last
and
do easier exercises first have a higher
stimulus to fatigue ratio for the
session
and there's some exercises they may just
write off completely there are a lot of
folks
in bodybuilding that don't do flat
barbell bench presses it's a great raw
stimulus magnitude move
it does connote a little bit more injury
risk to the pectoralis muscles
especially when they're gigantic
some folks by the time they're advanced
their shoulders might not take it so
it's just not worth it for them
that's why a lot of high level pros just
don't bench press does that mean the
bench press is bad for chest development
no it's probably better than almost
every other exercise
but it's more tailored for beginners
intermediates right and
power lifters will also tell you that
for hypertrophy the bench isn't the
greatest they do it because they compete
in it but when they need chest
hypertrophy a lot of times they do like
incline dumbbell presses and machine
presses
an incline barbell presses and they
don't even do the flat bench because it
beats them up so much
so that's something to think about the
advanced will maybe need to start taking
occasional recovery sessions
so a beginner will just do you know 16
weeks of training with no deload
intermediate will do 10 weeks of
training and on the 10th one take a
de-load but every single week of
training is more
more and more an advanced individual
might do two weeks of training up
and then two or three days easier and
then two weeks of training up and two or
three days easier or just not come to
the gym and then another two weeks up
and so on and so forth
and then deload after week six instead
of week ten right
a lot of times you'll see high level
bodybuilders saying like
you know uh today we were going to
recycle you know some of them are on
advanced splits where they just train
every five days or something
they say like you know it wasn't ready
so we took one extra day off and eat
more food and it will be ready tomorrow
that's something beginners intermediates
almost never need because they have no
problem catching up to the recovery as
long as they stick to the basics
advanced lifters the difference between
a great stimulative session
and a session that is neither
stimulative uh to your muscle growth and
is also injurious
uh is a real short window there so
sometimes you can say am i really ready
to train legs again the answer is no i'm
gonna take a light session
and then have three more great leg
workouts after versus biting the bullet
pulling a muscle and then it's all all
the shit or biting the bullet and just
undershooting all my rep
stuff and actually the under performance
there may be no muscle gain if you're
an advanced individual and because of
uh this enhanced fatigue management use
and because they take so much more of a
beating and fatigue rises so quickly
the advance will have shorter
accumulations and we'll get to the
accumulation length
a little bit later when we talk about
phase potentiation
stimulus recovery adaptation beginners
should start at roughly two to three
weekly total sessions
of weight training exercise you don't
want to do
too much because you want them to have a
rock steady adherence when they
really like the lifting and they've
shown you or themselves if you're
watching this video
for the first time by yourself and
you've never trained before not
recommended this is very advanced stuff
um if you're working with someone who's
a pretty pretty
beginner person let them show you that
they can come into the gym routinely
three times a week or twice a week
for weeks and weeks and weeks maybe even
months and
they're always going to be saying some
of these people are going to be saying i
want to do more
great show me you could do this right
it's like refills at uh like all you can
eat places sometimes like endless shrimp
and pasta bowl or whatever
like red lobster or some shit they don't
bring you another bowl of pasta until
you finish the last one
that would just be a huge waste just the
same way i'm not gonna put you on a six
day a week split if you're gonna
half a week and a half later conk out
and a ton of people do
beginners almost always bite off more
than they can chew it's the nature of
being a beginner
but you can help prevent that by giving
them two or three sessions a week
full body and then from there if they're
really good at it and they really really
love it and they've missed no sessions
or whatever
after a few months go to three or four
and after a few months go to five or six
and then by the time they're
intermediate they're gonna be training
five or six times which they damn well
should be
right and you train every muscle and
every single session because they
recover that quickly
and you train it mostly through raw
stimulus magnitude
uh high compounds deadlifts squats
benches overhead press etc
notice there's a pattern here that's
emerging intermediates should probably
be training four to six sessions a week
why anything less than four if you're an
intermediate if you're training only
three times a week you're not going to
be getting your optimal
growth amounts it's just not enough
training or the sessions are so long
that there's
a ton of junk volume at the end of each
session and again you don't get your
best results
intermediates a lot of times ask what
about double daily sessions and things
like that that's something you really
want to do more as in advance because
that's when you need it and that's when
you can psychologically survive it
okay beginners intermediate
intermediates can burn out
doing more than six sessions a week and
also they mostly just don't need it so
six sessions a week
four to six four five or six super great
for intermediates
and uh as needed based on the recoveries
of each muscle
two to six times a week training
frequency per muscle group so they can
do a push-pull leg split where
everything's twice a week and they can
do any other split in between
they can do a whole body six week or a
five day a week whole body split where
everything
is trained every single day or anything
in between totally fine
advanced are probably going to be sort
of floating into this area where when
you're advanced you probably have a
lower frequency of training at least
hard for larger muscle groups hamstring
squats
chest things like that and then for
smaller muscle groups and ones that
recover very quickly
uh you know like side delts rear delts
biceps maybe uh triceps for some people
uh they're going to have a higher
frequency of training all right maybe
two to three for the lower ones three to
six for the higher ones sometimes so
muscles are going to recover differently
there's going to be a lot also of muscle
specific frequency insights you're going
to be learning your body at this point
in advance you're going to be knowing
better and better how often you can
train a muscle can you train the
hamstrings three times a week the answer
may
be maybe no can you train your biceps
two times a week and remotely put enough
volume with them so that you really know
their limiting factor is recovering no
probably not
so your hamstrings may never go above
two sessions a week and your biceps may
never drop below three
that's something you should have to
learn by yourself as you're doing this
as opposed to
sticking to more of a split or a
pre-programmed
frequency arrangement as an intermediate
and as a beginner there's no frequency
arrangement because they train every
muscle every single time
so as you can tell it's kind of like
beginner training every single muscle
every time you go to the gym
with compound heavy basics not even
muscle specific like beginners don't
train chest they train
press right or various process incline
and flat
and then intermediates get put on a
split a program that
is either very high frequency moderate
frequency or anything in between
and they sort of stick to it and milk it
really milk it out and they start to pay
attention to what muscles
sort of comport better and worse with
that and then the advanced
will really start to have a more
individualized program where some
muscles
necessarily get trained more often and
some muscles less often
based on recovery time and
multiple daily sessions yield notable
returns for the advanced
so if you're advanced you may not be
able to do justice to all of your muscle
groups in six
sessions and it might be better for you
to split up quads and hams in a single
day as opposed to doing just legs
like a leg training session is not a
huge problem for someone who
can squat 315 for reps for someone that
squats 495 for reps
after you've done your quads you can't
see straight
forget hamstrings and anything you do
for hamstrings right after
is either going to be relatively
suboptimal or just total waste of time
junk volume
and remember from earlier in the lecture
the threshold for how hard a workout has
to be to cause any gains rises as you
get advanced
so not only does the person who just did
quads with 500 pound rep squats and
700 pound rep hack squats not only does
that person
now have a huge huge systemic fatigue
into which they have to train their
hamstrings with
but they have to train their hamstrings
harder to get gains than anybody else
it's a double edge it's not even a
double-edged sword it's like the hammer
from the bottom hammer from the top
so a really unsustainable scenario which
means either you intentionally take a
an easier session for hamstrings and
later in the week you do hamstrings
first quad second or better yet and it
is objectively better
to split your training up and do quads
in the am hams and the pm and then later
next week quads
uh in the pm hams in the am vice versa
something like that
so that when you come in you just train
quads
then you can really pour it in and then
later when you come in to train hams
you've had two meals in your system
you're rehydrated you're recovered you
can now do diligence to a hamstring
workout just an example that's not how
you should be doing it
but that's when multiple daily sessions
become obvious uh another really quick
example intermediate may be able to do
an awesome back workout and then an
awesome bicep workout right after
an advanced person may have to try so
hard to train their enormous back
it might sap their systemic fatigue so
much that biceps after
is limited entirely by systemic fatigue
and not local factors which is to say
your biceps are basically three rir at
best
when you're going to true failure
perceptively local muscle is three rer
because the nerves are just like done
i'm not trying anymore that doesn't get
you any growth
and because we said a lot of times
advanced people benefit most from two
one and zero rer three rf for everything
may give you just
maintenance at that point it might be a
good idea to take the back workout do it
in the am take the biceps out
and maybe add some shoulders in or
something put it in the pm
then you do your biceps much more fresh
then you're back into the golden zone
you're getting great results something
think about
variation beginners should not do a lot
of variation
why because they want specific basic
techniques in grain so they shouldn't do
too much stuff because it's a lot of
stuff to remember in the human body and
brain can't do it
so too much variation is bad stick to
the compound heavy basics
and sets of five to ten reps
predominantly to teach the basics best
and here's the thing do you need cable
crossovers pec deck
deficit push-ups dips barbell incline
and barbell flat press to develop your
pecs
optimally as a beginner no just doing
barbell incline
and dumbbell flat gets you 100 i'm going
to say 99 100
of the pec development you could have
gotten doing 50 other exercises we'll
say 99 to be charitable
okay but you get so good at those
movements that you really
start to become super awesome at them
very stable technique and remember once
you learn how to do any compound press
all the other compound processes are
super easy to do
it's not overwhelming you get to build a
ton of momentum and strength a ton of
body awareness a ton of basic technique
you take everywhere else with you
way way better than trying to throw the
kitchen sink you can save the kitchen
sink you'll need it later
intermediates may start
to do more variation for its own sake
because you'll have to have more
variation beginners don't essentially
experience stainless at all
if they just start lifting a year of
squatting later you can be like oh
squats getting started
boring or tiring they're like no i don't
know they're really hard really great
right they'll get greater and greater
and greater they're actually tuned in
more to the squat as their technique
improves
it's a counter to any kind of building
stainless whatsoever intermediates will
start to experience stainless for the
first time
so just for its own sake as an
anti-stainless device variation is a
good idea and
by doing a few more variants here and
there they start to explore
what is a better sfr exercise for them
and also to get a more complete
development
so beginners very low variation
intermediates
more variation advanced interestingly
enough
don't just go to more variation
beginners very little variation
intermediate's a good amount of
variation advanced the same amount of
variation
but more strategic variation as
described in an earlier lecture what
that is
and less variation just for its own sake
so intermediates might have done leg
presses for six months and that got
stale so they'll do hack squats
because the leg presses are stale and
it's just something different
an advanced individual may have been
doing leg presses for a few months
and they're getting great quad growth
and stimulus on the sort of
distal end of their quads that they need
more middle of quad meat and it seems to
be that that's where hack squats
concentrate more of their tension and
where they get more the sore and so on
and so forth
so they may do hack squats because they
need to address that specific thing
that's strategic variation that's
variation with a purpose
right directed strategic variation
there's a couple of sub terms there
they're all very related
all in the book by the way so advanced
don't necessarily do just
random dumb shit they do the same number
of variations intermediates do
generally are very similar one but they
do very specific ones
based on which other ones they tallied
as intermediates are best for their
stimulus to fatigue ratios
so there's a lot of exercises they don't
do anymore
or as often because they know the
stimulus to fatigue ratio for them
doesn't make a whole lot of sense
so advanced learn which variants are
best and then schedule the variance
strategically
in order to get the best possible result
another thing is you know intermediates
might do
sets of squats here and then sets of leg
press here and one mazda cycle in the
next mountain cycle
an advanced lifter you know just because
of variation just because they need
something new
an advanced lifter might do squats here
in the five to 10 rep range when it's
heavier
because he can't do uh squats in the
higher rep ranges because of systemic
fatigue limitations
that's why they may choose leg presses
same externally viewed variation but for
different reasons
face potentiation second to last
beginners
don't have anything to re-sensitize
because they just start
so they can train with d-loads once
every three to six months
okay that's pretty interesting right so
they get really tired and their
technique starts to break down
take the next week and uh you can come
in twice instead of three or four times
and we'll just lift with half the volume
and then you'll be super refreshed and
that's super true you don't even need to
reduce the weight on the bar a bunch of
times
or sometimes the first session's heavy
the second session's really light
they're like i feel like this is nothing
i want to
go crazy and lift and the next week
they're geared up for another three to
six months of no deal totally fine
and they don't need low volume phases or
active rest phases for their entire
first year of training
if you're training someone for the first
year you have an active rest phase
planned in like month six
you're insane okay they don't need that
stuff okay it's like saying you know we
need to periodize the training
super early of like little league soccer
like yeah you need to
teach them technique you don't need to
worry about peaking them for the big
game there's no big game
right same here there's there's not
enough fatigue accumulated to need an
active rest it's just pissed away time
and it can demotivate people like if you
kick people out of the gym for two weeks
that have
only been lifting for three months they
may just never come back right
so habit building is really good here
they like to lift let them lift
intermediates that's when you start to
need regular low volume training phases
okay two or three weeks here and there
to bring down the heavy
the super high volumes of accumulation
phase might be a good idea
but during these low volume phases
they're not going to have a ton of
joint connective tissue fatigue mostly
just volume
desensitization so they can do their
maintenance phases their low volume
re-sensitization phases same thing as a
strength like they basically
like just do strength training there
sets of three to six or whatever
and that's totally cool so still very
hard but with low volumes and reps
then they're really resensitized later
and they've gained some strength and
some technical ability
it's all really good a lot of times for
intermediates too they're not super
bought in 100
like advanced star to the process so if
you just make them train super easy for
a month it's really really demotivating
so it's not easy just different
lower volume lower reps but heavy heavy
heavy and close to failure that does a
really great job without any downsides
uh intermediates will also start to bump
into systemic mrv limits if they try to
train all their muscle groups up to mrv
every single meso so you might have to
start doing one or two muscles per meso
on a back burner
so maybe you train your whole body super
hard
but you take quads and glutes and do
them on the back burner so you have more
for your upper body more for your
hamstrings and
calves and then later you might train
your whole body super hard accept your
arms your train a little easier so you
can do more back and chest stuff and
more leg stuff stuff like that just a
few muscles you turn down a little bit
not like a bunch of muscles advanced
will need more active rests and low
volume phases because they get beat up
super easily
and they might need
in the resensitization phases the
re-sensitization phases might need to be
so unintense okay so
light and weight to let joints and
connective tissues heal because that's a
big problem for advanced people that are
very strong
have been training for a while have lots
of accumulated wears and tears
that instead of a month of maintenance
being a strength phase for them it could
be just two or three weeks because
that's really all they need
but it's just a really long active rest
phase so they do more active rests and
maybe even fewer maintenance phases give
that some thought because they can't
survive even a maintenance phase because
it's too heavy
and advanced will rely heavily on
priority phases
as they have very specific muscles they
need to bring up as mentioned earlier in
specificity
so a lot of times like in order to get
their body to balance and look like they
want they
don't want to train legs and chest and
back super hard they just need to train
their arms super hard and everything can
be a minimum effective volume or
maintenance volume
and their systemic limit is for mrv is
is very very pertinent and
so their systemic mrv might be here
and the sum total of every body part or
every muscle group if they train at two
individual mre might be here
so they might actually have to train
only half of their muscle groups
at med mrv in any one mesocycle and the
rest of them are maintenance
volume and they're not even rotated by
random
like a lot of times they'll say you know
for intermediates you just rotate in and
out
things that were on back burner go to
the front things around the front come
back and just rotate to keep everything
growing the same
on average but just never overdo any
systemic mrv with advanced
remember it's all directed now it's all
strategic so
you know the rotations might be like
they do you know
arms arms arms arm upper body upper body
upper body and lowers on the back burner
for three mesos
lower goes on the front burner for one
meso because they just need to bring it
up a little bit and really just more
give their
upper body and arms a rest and then
after an active rest phase they go back
to doing
three upper body and arms and uh
legs on the on the batter on the bottom
burner on the back burner
for three whole mesocycles right so you
think okay but that means they're
training
for every one mesocycle of leg
advancement on the front burner m e v to
mrv
they're training upper body and v number
v three
more meso three to one that's ridiculous
why well there's a good reason because
they are intending to bring up their
upper body because that's their weak
point
and if it's not the weak point it's
going to look completely different the
other way around
individualization the last
training principle and this is actually
this lecture is part of
individualization but it turns out
long-term athlete development can
actually change how you apply
individualization so here's the deal
beginners must learn and practice the
basics
and the basics are very much the same
for everyone so there's very little
individualization of maximum muscle over
the course of your career
is the goal it really your training as a
beginner is going to look almost the
same as every other beginners who's
doing it right
okay you're not going to be like well i
feel like i need more bicep of course
you need more bicep you need more pec
you need more quality more everything so
everyone does the basics very very
similarly and this is like that in
almost every sport
beginners to almost every sport trained
pretty much the same way
intermediates at that point have to
learn to pay attention a little bit more
to body responses
figuring out what is required from their
individualization
their preferences their tendencies and
to begin experiment with various
techniques
exercises rep range biases etc
they want to individualize but they
don't know yet
what their individual proclivities and
declavities are
so you can think of it as kind of like a
tree where
the bottom is beginners and they stick
to one straight narrow technique basics
on the compound heavy basic movement
then we're going to get a bunch of
branches going for intermediates
to see which ones bear fruit and which
ones bear more fruit which ones don't
so they're going to be doing a whole
bunch of stuff you could say it's
individualization it's the first part of
individualization
where you don't individualize your
programs you really just do a bunch of
stuff
but you're really perceptive about
what's better and what's worse
as you mature to advanced the tree
analogy here
is we start pruning some of the branches
that produce no fruit
to give more life force so to speak to
the ones that produce a lot of fruit
as an advanced individual you have to
really be getting into
what works best for you you'll have a
really good list as an advanced lifter
of mostly do's and mostly don'ts as a
beginner
you don't do leg extensions mostly
because they're a giant waste of time
for you should be doing squats and leg
presses and other basic movements like
that mostly just squats
as an intermediate you might start to do
leg extensions and leg presses and
squats and be like okay i'm starting to
feel like a leg extensions i get
really good at high reps but actually
leg presses are best for me
five to ten reps i didn't know that
that's interesting and i'm able to squat
for sets of 10 to 20 unlike most people
and it's still eliminating my quads
great you're learning
and then as an advanced you should know
things like well you know what leg
extensions for me are no good if i go
over sets of 25 reps but between 15 and
25
that's really good leg presses work well
for me if i do them
after leg extensions but then they only
work in this rep range and squats are
good here and there and there
so there's a lot of stuff that if
someone says hey have you tried
accenture like this
if you're an intermediate if you're a
beginner you say yeah uh no but no
thanks because i'm not ready for that
stuff yeah as an immediate cpu that's a
really great idea i'm going to try that
max mezzo and see how i respond as an
advance you should be like tried it
that's stupid doesn't work for me or be
like that's exactly what i do when i
found the same thing
if you're an advanced lifter you should
never have a closed mind always have an
open mind
but if you're a beginner some stuff's
just not for you yet i just figure like
you're like a little kid
and there's alcohol at an adult party
and you're at the party with your
parents right like
you know all the kids play they're just
drinking is not for them okay
as an intermediate you're of age and
you're in college it's time to try every
kind of drink
responsibly and see which ones you like
and which ones you don't you have a
couple of bourbon hangovers and you're
like fuck that bourbon sucks
right and you have some fun nights with
tequila and you're like tequila's great
which personally for me
by the way i hate tequila and bourbon
shit anyway and then as an advanced
think of yourself and training-wise is
the alcohol analogy here is you're like
a connoisseur of alcohol
like not like you have a problem or
anything but like you know you're like a
seasoned drinker
and and if someone's like you know hey
like here's this martini bar
you're gonna be the person that looks it
up online and be like oh they serve
their matinees this way that's not my
jam they're like oh it's interesting
they're doing like this eastern method
like great let's go figure that out
this is like to a person who doesn't
drink that all means nothing
to a person that just started drinking
like it's all whatever who cares martini
whatever i'll try it all
but to an advanced drinker so to speak
you know someone who because there's
lots of folks that really like to drink
responsibly and they get a lot out of it
they know what they like and they know
what they don't of course they still
explore
but there's they start to develop a
structure stick to that structure
so for advanced just the same way with
training
there's going to be stuff you know about
yourself and stuff you don't so yes
individualization is really coming to to
a spear at that point tip of the spear
you know from your immediate days what
the sort of landscape looks like and now
you're selectively choosing which way to
go more often than not
if you're advanced and you really just
everything looks the same to you as oh
i'll try that
you're not doing a great job or you're
not really advanced
implications
last sort of four things to say for this
part of the lecture
the recommendations for beginners that
you have just seen in this whole lecture
are
very different from those of the
advanced and of course different
respectively from intermediates on both
ends beginners
should not copy advanced verbatim
programs as
is so common right
uh folks will look at an advanced
program
and uh you know they'll read about it in
a muscle magazine or they'll look at it
on instagram and
beginners will be like i'm gonna do that
you know that's good for this pro
bodybuilder it's
surely good enough for me you're not at
that developmental timeline
it might not be the best idea it's like
trying to succeed
at uh making your own incredibly awesome
software company
and looking at the daily schedule of
events that bill gates does you'd be
like man the way
to be an awesome software engineers go
to a lot of charity functions and travel
the world on first class got it
well that's backwards at first you got
to sit in your garage and develop a
bunch of algorithms
and then you so you get a job at a real
firm then they buy you out then you make
your app and then you're a billionaire
and then you give to charity
there's a sequence to that so beginners
look at pro bodybuilders and say oh he's
doing one arm pec flies
with an internal rotation like that that
that's what i need for pex no
a bodybuilding judge last show said
listen your left pack is notably a
little bit bigger than your right
especially on the lower side maybe you
can bring that up a little over the next
that is a very very different thing so
there should be a big difference in
application between
beginners and advanced and a small
difference but a notable one between
beginner intermediate advanced beginner
bodybuilders
should basically train like power
lifters
but do a little bit more vertical
pulling work more shoulder work and more
arm work and of course calves than usual
sets of five to ten reps compound nasty
gnarly exercises full range of motion
really good technique
and not super close to failure that's
how powerlifters train especially in
their early careers
so power lifters at the beginning of
their careers and if you want to be the
best powerlifter of all time at some
point and the best bodybuilder of all
time at some point
for the first two or three years of
training very few people will be able to
tell your training apart
if at all the only difference is you may
learn some competitive pulling squatting
and benching styles bigger super arch
low bar squat
sumo you know uh hook grip deadlift for
power lifter they can start learning
that stuff
in day one whereas a bodybuilder might
learn very similar moves but not with
those exact specific techniques and they
might do more vertical pulling so on and
so forth but it's fundamentally very
similar
get stronger in the 5 to 10 rep range
and get your technique awesome
and size will come like crazy until
you're intermediate and you need more
advanced stuff
more specific stuff to bodybuilding
intermediates
can really begin to explore what
individualizations
rep ranges exercises so on and so forth
work best for them
and start to parse it out but they
should try a bunch of different stuff
right intermediates are the folks that
when they get to a new gym
in a new city when they're traveling or
something like that you go on a vacation
with your parents or you know with your
friends
and you get to a new gym you're like
whoa look at all this weird new
equipment like i've never done this kind
of machine
try it try it don't just stick to one
rigid program
when you're at home for sure stick to
your program but when you're traveling
you have an opportunity even if you're
at home you're at a home gym
maybe you're lucky enough to have a gym
that has a lot of different types of
equipment try some different stuff
your core of your program should still
be in the compound heavy basic lifts but
try a little different weird pull down
handles that's the kind of stuff you're
trying
by the time that you were advanced of
course you should be trying some new
stuff every now and again
but really you should start to settle in
on what your individual preferences are
where you get your best investor fatigue
ratios start to get very
meticulous whittle down to exactly what
you need there's a big list of dues big
list of probably not
and really milk the most out of your
training because now that is the time
to make the best things happen you're
only advanced for so long and to hit
your peak
and it's time to retire and go you know
long distance skiing or switch a sport
or something
so at that point yes you want to have an
open mind and do some weird stuff but
you also want to settle in on what you
know works really well for your body
and have the blinders on just a little
bit folks thank you so much for tuning
in i hope you got
out of that uh talk something i had a
lot of fun giving it
we will see you next time in our
tripping concepts tools number 27.
you
