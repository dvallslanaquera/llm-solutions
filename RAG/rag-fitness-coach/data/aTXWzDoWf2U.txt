whatever marketing they did for this
product clearly worked really well
because the actual formula itself makes
no sense at all aside from
a money making perspective
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in today's video i'm going to be
doing a science-based review
of some of the most popular well-known
pre-workouts that have been released
over the years
and show you guys just how good or how
bad these formulas actually were
beyond all the marketing hype that
surrounded them now there have been
countless different pre-workouts that
have come and gone over the years okay a
lot of different ones that i could have
included here
but i've narrowed it down to the four
pre-workouts that stood out the most for
me
so i'm sure you're going to find this
interesting and it's also going to be
educational as well because i'll talk
about
various different pre-workout
ingredients and whether or not they're
worth using and i'm also going to cover
some important information on how to
properly read pre-workout labels
so that you can get the most bang for
your buck when you're selecting
supplements for your own fitness program

first on the list
most of you will probably never have
even heard of this one but i thought
this would be fun to include here
we're traveling all the way back to
before a good chunk of you were even
born
all the way back to 1982
that's it that's it
to the first commercial pre-workout ever
released and that was a product called
ultimate orange so this was formulated
by a guy named dan duchaine
uh who some of the more seasoned lifters
out there might be familiar with
he was a bodybuilding author and uh like
a well-known
ped expert back at that time and i
actually searched online for hours
trying to come up with the original
ultimate orange label but unfortunately
i couldn't find it
um if any of you know where i can get my
hands on that then feel free to
dm it to me over on instagram but what i
do know for sure
is that the ultimate orange formula the
base of that formula
was a caffeine and ephedrine combination
now the younger guys out there are not
going to remember this firsthand
but back around like the early to mid
2000s
caffeine and ephedrine was basically the
main go-to stimulant combination that
people used um it was pretty powerful
stuff and it was actually a reasonably
effective fat burner as well at least
compared to
most of the typical fat burner
supplements that are being sold on the
market today
it worked both by increasing overall
metabolic rate and by blunting appetite
as well and a really common way that
people would use it
was as part of what was called an eca
stack which was
ephedrine caffeine and aspirin and the
aspirin was added in it to
increase the stimulant effects of the
ephedrine and to reduce blood clotting
which was actually one possible
ephedrine side effect but as far as
ultimate orange goes
uh in the later 1990s and early 2000s it
got hit by
a bunch of different lawsuits and
eventually it was taken off the shelf
and ephedrine itself was also banned
later on too
for people with no underlying medical
conditions
and who can tolerate stimulants well
caffeine and ephedrine when they're
taken within the proper doses
it's typically considered to have an
acceptable safety profile
but i would say that overall it's not a
combination that i would just broadly
recommend to everybody
it is a really strong stimulant
combination and i think it's just a
little bit extreme for most people to be
taking something like that
just for a minor increase in fat loss or
for a small performance boost and for
people
who do have underlying issues it can
have some serious side effects
in some cases so i don't know what the
exact ultimate orange formula
originally was they do have a current
modified version that they do
sell but all in all since the original
version was a caffeine ephedrine based
product it's probably not something that
i would have actively recommended
except for a smaller percentage of
people all right next up we fast forward
to around 2004 and the next pre-workout
on the list is
no explode which i'm sure a lot of you
have probably heard of
um at that point i've been lifting for
around four years and i remember eno
explode being
a really popular product that people
would always ask about on the
bodybuilding forums
and the formula has been revised a bunch
of times over the years
but this here is the oldest label that i
could find and just like most
pre-workouts and
even just bodybuilding supplements in
general at that time you can see that
the whole formula is based off
a proprietary blend and what that means
is that they show you all the
ingredients that are included in the
product
and the total amount for all of them
combined but not the specific dosage per
ingredient now the supposed reason for
using a proprietary blend
is that the company has this secret
unique never-before-seen formula that
they want to protect
so that their competitors can't copy it
however
in reality proprietary blends are really
nothing more than a cost cutting
technique
in the vast majority of cases if not all
cases it's basically just a way for the
company to
hype up the label with a long impressive
sounding list of ingredients
sprinkle in just a tiny bit of some or
even all of them
and since the average consumer out there
really has no idea when it comes to
proper supplement dosing and they're
really just responding to
the marketing behind the product
my name is gregorio gallagher i belong
to a special group of fitness
enthusiasts
you may not have heard of okay then as
long as
a bit of caffeine and maybe another
stimulant or two are added into the mix
so that people can subjectively feel the
product working it's still going to sell
extremely well
and speaking of marketing this is
probably the main reason why eno explode
was so successful at that time
ronnie coleman was basically a
bodybuilding god around that time
i guess you could say that he still is
and he was actively endorsing the
product when it was first released
however if you actually look at the
product label itself and you dissect
the ingredient profile and the dosages
it's really just a total disaster
okay keep in mind that the ingredients
in a proprietary blend are always listed
from highest to lowest in terms of
dosage
and so the primary ingredient here is
arginine alpha-ketoglutarate arginine
akg was really popular back at that time
and it was marketed as a pump ingredient
it's as satisfying to me as the [ __ ]
is okay lots of hype surrounding it
but over the years the research has
essentially completely debunked it as a
pre-workout ingredient
some studies show a very minor benefit
and some show
no benefits at all probably because
l-arginine is really poorly absorbed in
the intestines
and a high percentage of it can't even
be utilized by your body in the first
place
so the main ingredient in nano explode
basically won't do anything at all for
you
after the arginine there is citrulline
malate which is a solid pre-workout
ingredient for maximizing
overall strength and endurance however
there's no way to know how much
is actually in there because the dosage
is hidden and if the dosage is too low
if it isn't at least four grams minimum
then it's going to be completely useless
for you then there's some creatine in
there as well
creatine is of course a good all-around
research-backed ingredient but at the
end of the day creatine really has
no place in a pre-workout formula
because it has no immediate effects on
performance okay creatine is something
that you take daily
in order to build up the overall
creatine stores in your body
and then from there the benefits are
always going to be present and not only
that but noexplode mainly uses creatine
ethyl ester
which is one of the many advanced forms
of creatine available that are
a lot more expensive but actually less
absorbable than basic creatine
monohydrate
they do have l-tyrosine in there which
is another high quality ingredient for
improving mental focus but again since
the dosage is hidden there's really no
way to
assess the efficacy of that and then
there's several other ingredients here
as well
but once again there's no way to analyze
them because without knowing the dosage
we can't really say anything about it
and dosage is absolutely critical it
doesn't matter how effective a given
ingredient is
if it's not being used in the right
amount so when it all comes down to it
there really would have been no good
reason to purchase this particular
pre-workout
because you know for sure that they were
using uh several straight up ineffective
ingredients
and then even for the ones that are
effective you wouldn't know how much
you're actually getting and that goes
for
the current version of eno explode as
well okay they're still using
proprietary blends
and the ingredients are still very
clearly underdosed and that initial
ronnie coleman endorsement
probably kicked the placebo effect up a
few notches for people who were using it
and as much as i respect ronnie coleman
for his bodybuilding accomplishments
clearly the guy is not very shy about
selling worthless products to his
audience
drawing here i got a good product here
i'm
trying to advertise besides my
strength toning lotion y'all always put
on my little
cardio session now i got me a new
product
and it's called a shrink waste trimmer

make sure to hit that like button below
i really do appreciate the support
and also leave a comment down below
letting me know which vintage
pre-workouts you personally used back in
the day
and which one was your favorite or
possibly which one was your least
favorite
next up moving forward to around 2008
maybe the most famous pre-workout ever
i'm sure most of you are probably
familiar with this one and that is
jack 3d or jacked i'm actually not sure
what the
intended pronunciation was there but
unlike no explode
this formula was a lot simpler and this
is the original label here so again it
uses a proprietary blend
the first ingredient is arginine akg
which once again is basically
a completely useless compound for
bodybuilding purposes
and then they have creatine monohydrate
and beta alanine
now if you understand supplement dosing
and you just look at the total amount of
the formula here which is about four
grams
you can easily see that all of those
main ingredients are completely under
dosed
the proper dose for arginine is three to
six grams
for creatine it's going to be about
three to five grams and then beta
alanine is going to be about
three to six grams so that means to hit
the minimum end of all of those
ingredients
you would need about nine grams in total
and to hit the upper end you're going to
need 17 grams so the fact that the
entire blend is only 4 grams
that proves without a doubt that all of
this has just been pixie dusted
to use some supplement industry
terminology not to mention that creatine
and beta-alanine have no immediate
performance benefit anyway
so why did people rave about jack 3d why
did
this pre-workout become so well known
even though most of the formulation
makes zero logical sense
uh it's because of this one addition
here which is one three
dimethylamalamine or
dmaa for short this compound was
originally marketed as a nasal
decongestant all the way back in the
1940s
uh similar to ephedrine actually and it
was reintroduced to the market by a guy
named patrick arnold
who specialized in creating what are
called designer drugs for athletes
that couldn't be picked up by normal
drug tests and so
shortly after ephedrine was banned he
started marketing dmaa
and eventually it became a pretty common
ingredient in
various pre-workouts so that's really
why jack3d was such a huge hit it's
because dmaa
is a very powerful stimulant especially
when you combine it with caffeine
i mean it's pretty much like getting
high before you go and do your workouts
but as most people know just like
ephedrine dmaa was eventually banned
and again this wouldn't have been a
pre-workout that i would have actively
recommended
because ultimately i just think that it
is overkill the long-term effects of
dmaa
aren't really known and i'm not a big
fan of loading up on a bunch of heavy
stimulants just to perform a basic
weight training workout it's just
too extreme of an approach and it's not
really necessary in the first place and
lastly going forward to around 2011
we've got cellucor c4 i honestly have no
idea why
c4 took off the way that it did it
doesn't have any
special unique ingredients there must
have been some unique marketing angle
involved that i'm just not aware of
because this product was and it actually
still is very popular
even though the formula itself is pretty
much as bad as it gets
this is the label here and unlike the
previous products
c4 doesn't use a proprietary blend for
most of it so we can actually see the
dosages and we can fully assess the
product so first up is beta alanine
which
again has no immediate effects on
performance and it's just a pretty weak
supplement for bodybuilding purposes
overall
because it only provides benefits on
sets that last more than 60 seconds
which
most people probably aren't even
performing in the first place and even
if they
are the increase in overall strength
that it's going to give you is going to
be very minor probably just
one or two percent at best the minimum
effective dose for beta alanine is about
3.2 grams
and c4 only has half of that they've got
creatine nitrate at one gram
again no immediate performance effects
from creatine and they're just using a
bare minimum dosage here
and on top of that there's no reason to
use any other form of creatine
other than creatine monohydrate since no
other forms have ever been shown to be
superior
creatine monohydrate has an extremely
high bioavailability of almost 100
and it will fully saturate your muscles
with creatine so there really isn't
anything more you can ask for beyond
that
arginine akg once again totally useless
ingredient
and a totally useless dose anyway the
minimum is three grams and then they
have caffeine
which is where all of the effects of the
product are ultimately going to be
coming from they've got
160 milligrams which is a moderate dose
there's some l-tyrosine
in there as well which is a solid
ingredient but you would need at least
500 milligrams
minimum to see any real effect and you
can see that the total amount of this
little blend that they've got here is
371 milligrams so minus the 160
milligrams from the caffeine
means that the rest of these ingredients
are ultimately just pixie dusted
so really as far as actual legit
pre-workout ingredients go
c4 is essentially 160 milligrams of
caffeine
and that's really it okay nothing more
than that which will give most people a
little kick
but again whatever marketing they did
for this product clearly worked really
well
because the actual formula itself makes
no sense at all aside from
a money-making perspective so those are
the four pre-workouts on the list
and as you can see none of these are
pre-workouts that i personally would
have recommended
either because of excessive stimulants
uh ineffective ingredients proprietary
blends
or some combination of all those things
and nowadays the
pre-workout market has just become
totally saturated with endless numbers
of different products so
there aren't really any that stand out
now as being like really prolific
and the honest truth is that most
pre-workouts out there just aren't very
good
they still have the same issues in terms
of poor ingredient choices
low dosages sketchy stimulant
combinations it's really just a total
mess out there
and it's mostly driven by marketing when
it all comes down to it and if you're

endless bs and gimmicks out there in the
