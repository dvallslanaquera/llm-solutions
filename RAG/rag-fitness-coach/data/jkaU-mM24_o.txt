range of motion simply put it's the
degree of movement at a joint where
training with a full range of motion
means you go through the full movement
potential for an exercise
and when you train with a partial range
of motion you purposefully cut the
movement
short in some way and from what i've
seen most people tend to fall neatly
into one of two camps
i would guess that at least half my
audience falls in the so-called science
camp where it's thought that a full
range of motion is better for muscle
growth
and for the most part partial reps are
really ego reps
but i'd say that some of you find
yourselves agreeing more with what i'm
going to call the bro side
where you'd rather use partial reps
either because they allow you to move
more weight or because they allow you to
keep constant tension on the muscle
by keeping the weight in the so-called
mid-range you might also point out that
many ifbb pro bodybuilders use partials
and they've got better gains than all of
us so the anecdotal support seems to be
on the side of partial reps as well
and up front i will say that i think
both sides have some good points
but which side has it more right well
let's start with the three arguments
coming from the bro side
their first argument is that partials
allow you to move more weight meaning
more tension on the muscle
and while it is true that you will be
able to load more weight when you cut
the range of motion short
that actually doesn't mean you're
putting more attention on the muscle and
that's because the extra weight is
coming at a cost
as you increase the weight you're
simultaneously decreasing the distance
that weight is moving for example let's
say you currently squat 225 pounds or
two plates per side
for three sets of eight reps if you
decide to cut the range of motion in
half
so now you can all of a sudden squat
three plates per side on the surface it
might look like you're handling more
total workload
but you're actually handling
significantly less doing 225 for three
sets of eight reps would net 5400 pounds
of volume but when we calculate workload
distance is assumed to be constant so if
we decide to jack the weight up to 315
pounds by cutting the range of motion in
half
we also cut our workload in half so that
increase in weight
simply isn't worth the trade-off in
distance from a hypertrophic standpoint
so the bro's first argument isn't the
best and trading range of motion for
weight is
almost always a bad trade but there may
be a few legitimate exceptions that
we'll get to
okay the second argument from the bro
side is much better in my opinion
and it's that partials allow you to
maintain constant tension on the muscle
by staying in what you could call the
active mid-range of the movement
and this argument is different from the
first because rather than just cutting
the range in half
the constant tension advocates tend to
stop just shy of full lockout
by cutting out the top and bottom of
each rep the idea here is that if you
fully lock out a rep
your muscle gets a little mini rest and
briefly loses tension
in between reps which may not be ideal
for growth and in fact one 2017 study
supports that hypothesis
researchers compared doing skull
crushers through a full range of motion
to doing skull crushers through a half
range of motion restricted to the middle
part of the lift
so the full range group would be getting
a little tension break at the top of
each rep
whereas the partial group would have the
triceps engaged from start to finish
throughout the set and after eight weeks
of controlled training they found
significantly better muscle growth in
the partial group
and by quite a lot just about twice the
gains by keeping constant tension
and these were decently well trained
subjects too and while the study did
have its limitations
for example the partial group may have
just been getting closer to failure i
still think it lends some support to the
bro's argument for constant tension
at least on certain movements so on
exercises like skull crushers and
dumbbell flies where the top part of the
range is really easy i think it does
make sense to stop slightly shy of full
lockout
however in my opinion this advantage is
most likely limited to free weight
isolation exercises
and probably wouldn't apply as well to
exercises that use cables and machines
because they
automatically provide constant tension
for the most part so here
it makes more sense to emphasize a full
stretch and full squeeze
instead and before we get too excited
about this single study i should point
out that of the six studies we currently
have on range of motion and hypertrophy
this is in fact the only one that
favored using a partial range of motion
again likely because a single joint free
weight isolation exercise like the skull
crusher
is uniquely benefited by constant
tension when compared to other exercises
and we'll come back to the other studies
here in a minute first let's address the
final argument from the bro side
which is that most ifbb pro bodybuilders
use partials now first of all i'm not
entirely sure that's true
at least in the classic era it was very
common to see top pros using a full
range of motion
on a variety of different exercises and
here you can see arnold and ed corny
doing some deep squats with a full
lockout at the top
but i know a lot of modern day pros do
seem to favor partials
so let's just assume it is true that
most ifbb pros today
like to do partials over a full range of
motion still the problem is that these
bodybuilding anecdotes
simply lack the rigor and control of
scientific studies
in other words it's really hard to say
if these bodybuilders are getting their
results from partials
specifically or from some other training
variable or from great genetics
or because of their nutrition or
supplementation now i don't think these
anecdotes are worthless i'm actually
open to the idea that partials are
better for this population but i also
think that when making recommendations
if there's stronger better evidence
available which there is in this case
these anecdotes should be taken with
something of a grain of salt
so let's take a closer look at what the
science really has to say about range of
motion
and muscle growth like i mentioned
earlier this year a systematic review
was published examining all six studies
that we currently have
looking at range of motion and muscle
growth now i won't have time to go
through all six in detail but the bottom
line is that all four lower body studies
found that a full range of motion was
better
and the upper body studies gave
conflicting results one of the upper
body studies found no difference between
doing full range curls
and active tension curls and the other
was the skull crusher study we just
discussed
again the only one out of the six to
actually favor partials
so taken together i think we have good
enough evidence to say that a full range
of motion
is usually better for muscle growth and
especially for the legs
i mean just consider this one study from
bloom quest and colleagues they compared
heavier
partial squats to lighter deep squats
and despite being lighter
the deep squats still caused much more
muscle growth
at every site across the entire
quadricep and taking all of this
evidence together i think the best rule
of thumb
is to use a full range of motion most of
the time by getting a reasonably full
stretch at the bottom
and a reasonably full contraction at the
top but this doesn't need to be taken to
the extreme
either and there's no benefit to pushing
your range of motion beyond your
comfortable limits
for example some people skeletons simply
won't let them squat ultra deep without
tons of lower background
so when deciding what full range of
motion means it is important to keep
your own mobility in mind
and avoid the more is always better trap
in fact a recent mass piece pointed out
that as long as you actually get to the
hardest part of a lift
you're probably maximizing the
hypertrophic effects and since squats
tend to be hardest at a round parallel
squatting to just below parallel is
probably nearly as good
or just as good as squatting aster grass
for quad growth but there are also a few
exceptions to the full range rule
first i think it does make sense to use
partials as an advanced technique on
some isolation exercises
where you simply cut the bottom or top
part of the range out where it starts to
feel really easy
for example i'll often cut out the
bottom of dumbbell lateral raises
because there's no tension on the delt
down there
and i usually don't fully lock out skull
crushers or dumbbell flies for the same
reason
i also think it's smart for more
advanced trainees to do some extended
sets on isolation exercises for stubborn
body parts
where you extend the set beyond failure
by doing partials
after exhausting your ability to do a
full range of motion especially if it's
your last set for that muscle
of course this shouldn't make up the
majority of your program but it can have
its place as an exception to the full
range of motion rule
second the bench press and deadlift may
also be an exception for some power
lifters or power builders
since the goal isn't to merely maximize
muscle growth but also to move
maximum weight within the guidelines of
the sport so i personally use a power
lifting style arch on my bench press
despite the fact that this will limit my
range of motion to some extent however
when you compare the joint angles
between an arched bench and a flat bench
there's actually not that much range of
motion difference anyway so this is a
fair
trade-off for me especially once you
consider that the bench press isn't the
only exercise i do for my chest
so i can make up any minor range of
motion deficit by simply combining
exercises
i also make a similar exception for the
deadlift where it's a smarter power
lifting strategy for me to use a sumo
stance
even if it limits range of motion
slightly and again because i still hit
the hardest part of the lift
the hypertrophic implications are likely
negligible especially once you consider
that i'll be combining different
exercises for these muscles again
so perhaps unsurprisingly i do find
myself more on the science side of this
debate
i think that as a general rule of thumb
training with a full range of motion
all the time will get you better results
than training through a partial range of
motion
all the time but luckily in the real
world our advice doesn't have to be
quite that black and white
and i think we'll get our best results
when we borrow the best of the wisdom
both sides have to offer all right what
is going on guys
thank you so much for watching the video
i really hope that you enjoyed it i want
to give you guys a quick update before i
close out the video here
first and most importantly look who's
back i made it
i'm here so she's been back in canada
for just over two weeks now
and it's been great having her here she
just finished up her quarantine
so we've been able to go outside and
enjoy some of the canadian snow
and the scenery and we're enjoying our
new home here in
ontario um also it is a new year so
happy new year to all of you guys um i
hope that you guys had a great christmas
and a great new year and i did want to
update you
on a couple things that you may find
resourceful if you're trying to take
your
your fitness or your body building goals
to the next level in 2021
first things first i do have a free
program available on my website it's a
two to four week
bridge program that's designed to help
people who've taken a break from
training
get back to regular lifting if after
that you want to run one of my programs
they're all
20 to 30 percent off up until january
14th
so for the first two weeks of new year's
you can save 20 to 30 percent off all my
programs
i also want to mention my ultimate guide
to body recomposition here i know
some people ended up losing some muscle
in 2020 which is understandable given
the circumstances
the good news is if you did lose muscle
you're primed and in the perfect
position
to build muscle and lose fat at the same
time which isn't always easy
but if you did lose muscle the muscle
memory effect will make it quite easy
for you
so this book details absolutely
everything you need to know about body
recomposition
and i'll leave that as a link in the
description box down below as well
thank you guys so much for watching if
you enjoyed the video don't forget to
leave it a thumbs up i hope you guys
have a very good year ahead and i will
see you all here
in a video very soon
