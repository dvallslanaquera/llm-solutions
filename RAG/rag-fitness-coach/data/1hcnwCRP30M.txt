hey folks dr mike here with
ifbb pro jared feather
my training partner my friend we're
going to ask him a couple questions
about his journey to the pros it's a big
deal getting ifb pro card
so jared how old are you
and how long have you been training uh
27 years old i'll be 28 february i've
been training for
12 years ish 12 years
and how much do you weigh right now in
this video oh god
don't want to say it because i was 205
on stage uh 222 this morning 2 22. yeah
it's all a solid rebound so yeah yeah
very good
when did you first decide you wanted to
be an ifbb pro
uh somewhere along
high school when i began training and i
was actually uh
there was this khqa news caster that
covered all the football games and
he kept comparing me i guess he was a
fan of bodybuilding he kept comparing me
to jay cutler and i was thinking jay
cutler was a quarterback for the bears
at the time that would have been
like a football compliment yeah football
compliment but he's like seeing he has
calves like jake cutler and this and
that and i was like
i look at his pictures of jay cutler
like what the fuck
then i was like i looked up jay cutler
the bodybuilder and i
remember seeing him on a magazine
because i worked for pepsi and i was
stocking shelves for pepsi at the time
as a job and i was like oh wow what a
compliment and i remember looking at his
physique and i was like this is
crazy this is the biggest man i've ever
seen in my life
and it was this you know a lot i would
read the muscle magazines
while when i was supposed to be stocking
shelves at the store
and i remember thinking these guys are
too big a little weird
i don't think i ever want to be that big
but i definitely pretty big
so somewhere between then and
midway through my my natural journey of
of bodybuilding
when i was winning shows i was like
winning these natural bodybuilding shows
i won the first show i ever did
and i was like maybe i was maybe this is
a thing i can do because i
had already you know told myself i'm
done with athletics i didn't want
severe injuries i don't want concussions
i wanted to use my intellect
to drive me forward and i didn't want to
rely on my physical attributes and
things like that
but bodybuilding was like you know low
impact lifestyle really good
and i was already doing the whole
bodybuilding lifestyle thing anyway
just without competing eating and
training eating and training and
enjoying the process and
learning lessons from the gym like you
know being very driven and motivated and
determined and all that and uh i was
winning these shows and i thought you
know man
i really think i have a thing here and i
can compete again and it
that's going to drive me even more so i
won that show and i saw how like
kind of this proud my mom was because
she wanted to compete
when she uh was younger before she got a
tumor and everything
and she just had to quit physical
activity altogether and it was really
cool when i kind of connected on it
and i i wanted to be a pro
i wanted to be a natural pro and
even before i was a natural pro i knew i
wanted to be at the top of the ifbb
now was the ifb pro goal at that point
for you more of a pipe dream
of like well maybe that'd be cool or was
it like no it's happening it's just a
matter of time and execution
like as i progressed maybe somewhere
around the time where i met you
and i i really started moving forward
with the natural bodybuilding
pursuing the pro card and not just doing
competitions to do them
um i i began to
kind of realize my genetics not that i
hadn't noticed they were pretty good
before
but i was like i'm very objective about
this whole thing if i knew that i had
bad genetics
and i knew what it would take to get to
the ifbb pro level
and it was something i wasn't willing to
put my health through i probably just
would have stuck with you know like
natural bodybuilding let's keep pushing
fitness let's keep getting smarter yeah
i got it so i'm getting to do all that
but also i was like you know
we're training really hard in the gym
and i'm learning all these concepts
under under dr mike is retail and it's
really neat
and uh i'm seeing a lot of progress and
it's really cool
and one thing that i want to do is drive
that forward in the ifbb
and kind of bring the education side
over eventually getting the phd
and this is the same thing you know you
want to do you know masters if you pro
card
and mine's just a pipe dream yours
was realistic i don't know i mean it's
just realistic too did it feel like a
pipe dream at some point you're like wow
am i really trying to do this uh in the
beginning stages maybe
and i think i just had a lot of really
really good friends around and and
people who were who were like
kind of affirming that it wasn't in my
head that i kind of had
because there's a genetic component to
it all and there's like you know jared
you
have been the most dedicated person i
know for so long and you have these
great genetics and i think that you
could really go far
and i was like you know i think that's i
think that's true i think i really could
but you know in the beginning stages you
always doubt yourself yeah sure there's
some level of that no matter what so
i think i knew i could all the way until
maybe that first competition
that's my next question how have your
prior attempts to this last one
had a ivy pro card gone and what
all the way up until that first
competition that i did when i started
competing in the npc
um just trying to peak the way i used to
peak and
and maybe not even getting lean enough
don't even know
i saw myself as this instagram
bodybuilder after that point i was just
like
i'm gonna be the guy who people see on
it on social media and i think he looks
really good
but he's not a bodybuilder he's like an
instagram bodybuilder
that kind of haunted me for the last
year and a half and i was massing and i
just
i knew that i could continue uh
pushing forward in the gym and doing
what i need to do being consistent
it's just the day-to-day stuff that we
already do anyway
but the second prep starts
it's it becomes this but it but am i
going to look like
how it should right at the end and why
didn't you in your first couple of shows
you did the arnold you did another show
yeah i mean it's
i'm not gonna say it wasn't lean but it
was probably some combination of not
getting lean enough
i had gluten rations and stuff which was
the first time i ever had but still
you know you could see there were some
fat loss but then there were some things
that you had to toy with
on the supplement side of things and
water and peaking and all that and i
think it has
really messed the peak up from body
water body water manipulation was was
wildly off and it's something that we're
learning about you know
with the help of broderick chavez and
you and me
just kind of putting our brain power
together and figuring this whole thing
out
and it's it's been taking us i'm not
gonna lie
it felt like it was taking a while and
now you look back and
i've only been competing on a pc for two
years this is my third
try getting because i guess you can
count the arnold classic as a try
getting a pro card because you can't get
one there
and then i did the usa's and then this
national show this is only my third try
and we've kind of figured a lot of
things out sure and we're continuing to
be students of the game and
figuring more and more out and uh
so i definitely think that's part of why
it wasn't successful and i felt that way
about just being an instagram
bodybuilder
right and then so when did you decide
you were going to be doing nationals and
what was your body composition weight
then what led you to decide that you're
like alright this this is it 20
20 20 nationals is what i'm doing um wow
we masked really well and i was
liking the way that i was looking we
moved out to vegas and
you know we did about two or three
master cycles out here
full full-on massing and just the
progress we were seeing
you were massing i was cutting guys you
were cutting you were cutting you were
cutting
and i saw you going through the process
and um i thought you know
2 30 nationals is 10 weeks away
i could do it i could i could start
right now
and i think i could make it and i think
that would be really good for us
to kind of go through that together
because you've been prepping for so long
sure and uh it's easier when your
roommates also 100 percent get out
100 i was like let's get on this similar
schedule
let's get super fucking lean together
let's do a bunch of you know promotional
videos and let's
it's not only gonna be good for that
desire we have because there is this
desire that we have no matter how like
how objective and scientific we are
there's something in us that we want
this this is the goal that we want
we want to be these these professional
bodybuilders and it's going to be
something that's like it means something
to us
sure um and i thought you know it'd be
really fucking cool to go through that
together
10 weeks is pretty rushed prep though 10
weeks is you could say
rushed you could say the variables were
all checked
properly so you lost no muscle you
weren't you had your clear abs when you
started right right so i thought it was
probably 12 to
15 percent pretty good place to start
any prep you know natural bodybuilding
prep at 12 to 15
should take 16 to 20 weeks you know
a prep it 12 to 15 percent not natural
is
it could take anywhere from eight to 12
weeks sure and it did and it did and
it was really cool because we just
figured it out we've played with the
variable we talked about it for a week
before i decided this is it let's stamp
it um and that's the cool thing like i
said i'm self-coached i'm objective as
hell with myself
i know when i'm getting emotional and
it's time to put that thought over here
and wait until i'm not
but when you have you and broderick and
we're all bouncing ideas off of each
other
and i'm like listen this is what i think
am i wrong you're like i think this is
probably a little better
i can say okay you're right and we
talked about it for a week and then
we both finalized some details and i was
like let's let's just do this man i
think it's a good idea not only for
you know trying to get it this year but
also just for
like business and everything else sure
what were your macros on average through
this
prep for pro and what did your lifting
look like and what how much cardio are
you doing just a real rough
because people are going to want to know
sure yeah on average i mean toward the
end i was hitting anywhere from like
probably 25 grams of carbs a day and
then in the beginning stages which was
the majority
of the prep 400 grams carbs 375 grams of
carbs
so you know anywhere in the 300 350
range average
yeah it was uh and then fats and 40.
uh 40 40 grams trace fats until the end
of the day and i get myself
uh a full serving of fat of peanut
butter i kept peanut butter in the
entire prep and like
never had cravings anything like that so
much protein and then
uh just like body weight protein it's
just 225 it was 225
and it was almost the entire time when i
went to 200 grams of carbs i potentially
raised it a little bit
uh just to um pre-requisitely
mitigate some of those uh craving type
of things that happen
when you don't have higher protein sure
so maybe a little bit higher
what about cardio cardio i
honestly we've been doing this thing
where we do
activity and steps and uh i probably
averaged
oh this is going to be so much lower
than yours 8k maybe
a day until the end steps yeah steps
um because you know we sit on our ass we
go to the gym twice a day we sit on our
ass and we work a whole bunch
yeah and uh you would walk around and do
podcasts i would sit on my ass still
all right so i'll just go to the gym for
30 minutes to an hour at the end of the
day
just if i felt i had a lower activity
that day i was like
let's go a little longer today okay so
it wasn't really
much it was just enough that i would i
could hit my average step
intake like or whatever output um
so yeah it wasn't terrible eight
thousand nine thousand average yeah
that's cool um all right when during
prep did you really
start to feel like you looked like a
contender
like you know we all have a moment
during property like oh shit i look like
a bodybuilder
when did that happen for you yeah uh
probably four
four weeks out three weeks out um i did
a warning show the steve car classic in
vegas
and made some modifications around two
weeks from that show
and within a week of those modifications
things just started happening and
probably lost a total of six pounds that
week
a lot of body wash a lot of body water
that was being stored sub-q
and i looked at myself and i was like
this might be interesting yeah
and the only thing that i had in the
back of my head was the peaking stuff
sure we had talked about it so much that
it was almost a sure thing
it was just doing it and that's why we
decided to sign up for the steve carr
show sure like two weeks out or whatever
it was sure so i got to practice his
people for nationals because if it works
it fucking works
sure and we're gonna do this shit at
nationals and it worked and it worked so
after the steve carr you were kind of
certain you're like okay i can bring
this again at the sea car i was 100
certain that i could
come to nationals my best ever peak like
perfectly and show up and do whatever i
could against whoever else showed up
sure because then the judges decided
exactly
it's just about me being the best shaped
most muscular
best posing guy there and you know i i
tried to check all all the posing posing
box and
you know peeking box and all that stuff
and
i did what i could and it was it was
enough it wasn't that wasn't
what uh what was your peak like for
nationals i mean
you had to make a weight which is pretty
unusual in bodybuilding most of the time
you show up at whatever
um so you had kind of two goals one was
to fill out and get dry
but the prior prerequisite literally
goal was to come in under 205 pounds
how did you uh handle that uh
i thought i could do it just with a
simple
diuretic response from higher water
intake higher sodium take with a
pretty swift drop but that's before
weigh-ins and then after that there's
some body water stuff of
re-compartmentalization that you're not
sure about
so it was best for me to just keep the
water lower and i knew that since the
steep car classic
maybe like eating some drier carbs here
and there keeping
trying to keep it above at that average
intake of 200 grams or so
so my diet was still the same mostly it
was just the higher water and higher
sodium
that led to some diuresis so i was
probably two
i was going to bed at like 216 and
waking up at like 208 on average that
week
with how much i was peeing through the
night i was waking up three or four
times
and i i went to bed at 2 15 that night
and i was like okay cool i'm gonna wake
up at 205. so i
woke up didn't even have a scale went
over
206. so i was like son of a bitch i had
to walk to my car
and at this point this is probably what
you want out of me
the water shit is the hardest thing for
me my next question was how did you feel
physically during the peak and went
after us how did you feel
everything about prep is completely easy
to me
it gives my life more structure i'm i
work more
the only thing that sucks is cardio and
even this time i learned to enjoy it
because i've never watched dragon ball z
fully i know i know and
i started working on it i started to
watch it and i was just two or three
episodes per cardio session it was
really cool i love
the fucking show it's awesome and uh so
that was easy but
dehydration to me man it's just it's so
shitty and i just get i get brain fog i
get everything from it
that most people talk about diet and
i had to walk back to my car to sauna
off like car sauna and this rental car
that i got
sauna off of poor next customers yeah
for real i mostly sweated my clothes i
think
yeah whatever and i was sitting there
for
15 20 minutes and i i knew i
sweat about a pound but
at one point i was just sitting in there
still
just for the simple fact that i didn't
want to move my hand and grab the car
door
momentum and push it open that was just
like
it was awful i grabbed this water bottle
from the uh from the middle console that
i had it only had this much water in it
and i began to walk back to weigh-ins
and i stopped probably three or four
times
and opened the bottle of water not out
of habit out of the fact that i didn't
give a shit
like people say like i'll do anything
right now i'll eat dog shit if i have to
no we all have these thoughts we all
have thoughts like that i was literally
on my way to weigh in knowing that i was
under 205 and gonna do classic
and i thought i can just do heavy weight
i can't fucking
i can't do this but i somehow got there
and i made i was 204.8 and uh
i got to finally go back eat a bunch of
carbs keep water really low keep sodium
really low
and uh just wake up dryer and dryer each
day it was like a two day
two day before the event weigh-in so i
didn't even use both days really to
carve up i did
uh the high-end average or the high end
of what my prep was 400 the day of
thursday which was the weigh-ins and
then i did a huge carb day on friday
with super low water i just woke up
looking exactly how i
had expected because of the steve car
peak so it was
it was a process the peak week itself
was fucking tough it was brutal
when you say huge carb how many carbs on
friday uh i
was like 1100 1200 okay yeah
describe the events of the win for us
like
the first time you get called on stage
in a comparison in your group
then the top six then the announcement
so on and so forth okay that all
how'd that all go and how did you feel
about it so the first thing that
happened is you uh
walk out on stage and the classes are so
big you just walk out with five people
five in order of numbers so like i had
309 the next guy let's pretend he's
three ten eleven twelve
and up to fifteen and we all five stand
there we go off stage next five come in
next five come in
there were 19 or 20 guys in my class so
that happened four times
um and then they bring us all on stage
and they just gotta look
look at us and uh or no then we do our
individuals after that
so all 19 guys come out and they do 15
seconds of hitting their best shots so
the judges can see them
by themselves so i knew what i had to
hit there and you know i was working on
posing a lot with uh mike from
san antonio and uh
did that went off and go back because
i'm the first guy to do that so i have
to wait 15 seconds times 18
or whatever so i'm still just like okay
i should probably do a little bit of
pumping in case i'm top five
so i pumped up and then they were like
brought everyone back on stage and
that's when they call numbers
and they called my number first and
honestly the excitement at that point
was like whoa
i can't believe this because they put
your center stage they put me center
stage immediately
and i was like okay but i've had really
poor experiences with that so i was like
this is what's gonna happen we're gonna
do a bunch of back double biceps they're
gonna move me to the end i'm gonna get
fourth or fifth
that's what i was thinking the whole
time and uh you know every time they
called a number i was just holding my
breath they were like
this number trade with and i was just
like come on
and they never said my number once they
were just moving people around me
uh to get second and third and never
moved you
never move which is a really good sign
right really good sign and then i i
found out that there were six guys in my
in my
first call out and i was like fuck
because
that could be anywhere from first to
third
and you know all the guys when we got
off were like congratulating me like
dude you did it like
congratulations and just with the way
that i was looking at myself
backstage versus looking everyone else i
was looking at myself in these really
elongated mirrors and i was like why do
i look so shitty
and i think i blew it and the peak is
like i'm getting watery
but i wasn't really i maybe stepped a
little water and
ate a couple things before i got on
stage just like you get a pump
and i thought it was fading because the
timing of bodybuilding sucks
so you know you eat something a little
too soon and and you start to get in
your head and
nobody was really back there with us i
wasn't going to make anyone buy a
coaching pass for
250 bucks so i was back there laying on
i was just like you know i've done what
i can
so i just laid back down put my
headphones on and uh
then went out and but yeah whenever we
offstage are all congratulating me
and i had a lot of excitement at that
point i like i was on the verge of tears
even at that point i was this is
insane i can't believe that i did this
and uh
but then you know you think about it
more through the day and like yeah it
could be third could be second who knows
all right so i just before and they'll
re-compare sometimes at the night show
so really it was just about
i'm gonna eat a meal i'm gonna maintain
this look i'm not gonna do anything
crazy with water
or sodium i'm just gonna keep this look
that i have right now
and that's what i did came back out and
uh we did our routines
they did top five and they called me as
an ifbb pro after so like third place
was called
and i knew i was a pro yeah cause top
two good top two get pros at the at the
national
show and even then i was kind of just
like
if i get second i'm not gonna feel like
a winner sure i'm not gonna feel like a
pro
and uh before they even call the second
the guy who got second his name is rohan
he's
really cool we've known each other for
like two years competed here at the
arnold before they even called his name
he like started walking out like
because he was the guy who was hyping up
the most he's like no dude you got it
like you literally just want he's like i
looked at pictures
you blew us out of the water and i just
like tried to do like i was like no
you look crazy next to me like look at
this he looked really good he looked
insane you know it's just like
but he starts walking and they call his
name and i'm standing there first i was
like oh my god i
did like it was it was really cool
um everyone afterwards came up to you
talked to you how did that feel it
lasted like an hour and a half
you had your giant pro card with you
your trophy yeah
it was neat you even have the
competitors before i even
well i do the overall so they had to
take everything away and i did the
overall
and then i was a little bummed because i
didn't win the overall so
i had to like stay in the backstage area
for a couple minutes
you know digest and uh
remind myself that you know i did it and
uh
come walking back and even the
competitors because you know you make
friends with some of these people
and a lot of them uh even people that
even like the bikini girls they're like
it's
becoming a pro is such a big deal that
everyone's just like congratulations
congratulations
and everyone back there's just like you
know because they're all waiting to know
if
they are too or like they're waiting
like and and they
they almost like it feels like they feel
that sense of like accomplishment with
you and they're all just like
congratulations and shaking your hand
like oh god i can't wait and
to go out and you know you talk to them
and it's really neat but i'm you know in
the back of my head i'm just like trying
to get out to
my friends who are all there and and i'm
always trying to
please people please so i was trying to
take it all in and let it
sit with me but uh it was neat just
walking from backstage to go out
grab my stuff and you know it was taking
20 minutes of person to like
talk things through and i get out and
my friend uh mike and ashley actually
won her ifbb
pro card there too and figured she won
the overall figure they're standing
there and
and he gives me a hug and i just like
fucking lost it
and i probably cried you know five six
more times that day you know
good day it was cool it was really cool
got a lot of pictures and
i tried to get pictures with uh mike and
my little brother because he was there
flew him out so he could come watch and
uh it was neat it was
a fun experience for him now that you've
had about a week to process it or just
over a week
what do you think about uh how do you
feel about being a pro
it's because it's a title so few people
ever hold yeah most people who begin
bodybuilding never turn pro
yeah i have to remind myself of that all
right i just made a post
i think in there you know i talked about
what it feels like currently
and kind of how i'm still trying to be
proud of myself
because never have balanced i can i can
stop and enjoy
the process no matter what and i'm very
proud of myself for doing that
enjoying the process and actually
finally living in the moment a little
bit and enjoying the day today
that's going on but enjoying the
accomplishment
is it's something that i have a
difficult time with i can't it's hard
for me to be proud of myself about
for it but i'm getting better i'm still
working other goals and i'm i'm
realizing what this truly like
this means for not only myself
but science and progress and
sure actually doing what we've talked
about this whole time
i want to turn pro
yeah that's it this is i want to make
sure that we can
continue bringing sports science into
bodybuilding
and people can be safer they can make
better progress
and you know all this nuance and stuff
that we debate all the time
they're going to see those things too
and like where
one person here is right and we're wrong
they're going to see that and they're
going to make their own decisions
they're going to be more rational and
logical about the training and their
dieting
and i can then you know talk about those
things and i can talk about
my route of becoming an ifbb pro from an
ipe pro so a natural pro to
a not natural pro and hopefully
that can help some people too because
there's there are a lot of kids who
immediately they start training don't
ever
learn to enjoy the process and they get
told by some guru old man at the gym
hey here's here's the steroid take this
and i can tell them you know listen i
can just kind of pass that message along
you should probably wait you should
learn the love shit first and then maybe
you can make that decision
if you so wish in the future sure if
you're so informed about it yeah being
informed um
last question what is uh what are your
plans for the next block the next year
and then
the future of your career oh boy uh
well i wanted to compete in the battle
of texas show which was two weeks after
the show
i was just gonna make my pro debut
immediately and i got a little quad
strain or something going on
i didn't want to train through that and
uh
push through something that could
potentially lead to
a career injury i have to work around
the rest of my freaking life
um so i paused that but i honestly think
that i
could have been 10 pounds heavier on
stage
and a lean and i'm going to deplete it
like crazy just to make weight for sure
so i'm just gonna do the same shit next
prep
but hopefully with 10 more pounds of
muscle so i'm going to mass up for the
next
four to six months and prep for a show
that can hopefully qualify me for the
olympia i want to do the olympia as a
classic physique guy
one time at least and then move to the
open and that's going to be another two
year layoff
three-year layoff before i move to the
open but i want
i want to do the olympia next year and i
think that i can
and i think that i have a different look
that most people in class of physique
don't have
and it could be rewarded in the pros
sure i just got to build some tissue
first
classic is a stopover for you 100 you
want to be an open class
absolutely why i think that
that's where my structure fits
that's what you should have bigger
skeleton
right to look filled out right i would
have to be like my back
whereas like i was talking about my my
back shots earlier
i've always lost with them i think i won
the show from the back which is insane
sure but it can be bigger but it can be
bigger and like and i can see those
things
even though i you know even though i won
um to fill my back out i'm just
a more broad person taller person five
ten and a half five eleven
it's gonna take a lot and i wanna i
wanna see what i can look like there
and ever since you know looking at jay
cutler on that magazine
and always thinking back to it and being
compared to that it's like
what if sure what if what if i can and
uh
i definitely think that's where i fit
and
with that comes a lot more things that
are potentially detrimental to my health
and that means that i get to uh see what
i need to do in order to keep my health
in check
what i need to do on a very minimalist
level because
i'm not going to do what the other guys
do it's going to be very very like we
always talk about it
even now it's like this compared to this
as far as supplements
yeah other guys are this and we're as
smart as possible about it
and uh keeping health in check and it's
like
i'm gonna get there doing this instead
of this
and i want to be able to help other
people do the same thing sure and
if i stay in classic you know i did i
did the thing
but i don't know what that's like on a
larger scale and i need to know what
that's like if i'm going to help people
through
