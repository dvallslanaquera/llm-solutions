slow
ly
that's what we want to see
[Music]
yo what up YouTube listen I used to roll
solo and then I realized there's a
four-letter word that takes that and
throws it away and it's
c-r-e-w that's crew and I'm deep stacked
today fellas we got Mr Alex Leonidas who
is a literal Spartan you never heard of
the 300 First Spartan that's my man he
didn't die in no battle he straight up
beat up everyone Perseus all the
motherfuckers is dead and now he's a
natural bodybuilder three weeks out of
his next show he's my man he's got his
own channel you better be checking it
out it's Alex Leonidas formerly Alpha
Destiny but the destiny is that he's
shacked and shredded and ripped
the only downside is he's a tiny bit too
light-skinned it which is where my boy
Johnny comes in Johnny Shreve the
Nigerian prince
the man to miss the legend what more can
I say what less can I say about him so I
don't get canceled for that Nigerian
prince shit I just said
you guys have seen Johnny before you
know who he is these guys both called me
up at the same time I had two phones
like this and they were like biceps and
I was like yeah and the other was like
Delta I was like yeah so we're gonna do
biceps and belts delts and biceps shout
out Mike let's get to work all right
let's do it
we're gonna do Maya rep match
cool which means yeah sorry wait wait
wait wait I know what that is fuck that
nice so who's wiping my ass after right
come over so we'll take care of it he's
gonna take a shower tongue wipe
daddy okay
[Music]
first exercise is the Atlantis lateral
raise machine the best lateral raise
machine in the business we are going to
be doing sets of 15 to 20 reps but it's
my rep match probably three sets is good
enough because damn
that means
do about 15 to 20 reps very close to
failure on the first set walk off Alex
comes in Johnny comes in I go back in I
have to do as many
many sets as it takes to get to 15. so
if I get to 12 that means I put it down
I rest for five seconds ten seconds and
then I do another three I have to match
15 15 15 every single set and so do
these motherfuckers or whatever reps I'm
gonna get
back
yep come on slow
[Music]
oh how many I don't know
after fifteen fifteen
come on come on go come on two slow
about rest for a sec don't go anywhere
rest rest
begin
finished push finish push finish slow
that's it oh yes dude there's only one
one King Leonidas on this motherfucker
dude
awesome your delts are popping out
is there really three heads this looks
like more than three heads you cheated
what are we activating to make sure we
do this entire thing like correct
flooring demotion like what are we where
are we where are we thinking feeling
this entire movement the first thing you
want to do
is make sure you're moving right from an
external perspective so start here or if
you're thinking Arc out not like this
shit where you pull in don't disappear
Arc out up and try to get the tops of
your hands to touch at the top
you don't have to do that but it's a
cool Cube
once you get there think of slowing The
Descent down using the very tops of your
shoulders and nothing else
and then back up just move
move on the concentric control with your
side delts on the E Center
there's other cues there are good cues
that's my cues for this shit cool
[Music]
thank you
oh let's go two more and then rest hit
it four come on four that's it yep
go in go in slow slow it even more come
on
whenever you're ready take your time
you gotta dig deep dig deep dig deep dig
deep come on move it push you move it oh
no come on move it yes
there you go
hell yeah shit
shit amazing it work man
you gotta get a high five
yo these guys don't push you
I don't even know what I'm saying wow
I'm glad it's hitting why
are these idiots
going so high up that the front delts
take over the movement
just because your front delts get so
much training from chest movements they
don't need a lot of extra training so
this top part is probably good enough
for them I don't do any other front delt
work than the small part I get here
but also yes past about here it's mostly
front belts but that allows us to get
free front delt work and the side delts
are still working to some extent but it
allows us to get up so high that on the
way down we're instantly eccentrically
controlling right off the bat because
the side belts are a bit unloaded up
here once you reach the top you can say
okay now I'm in control and that's slow
eccentric is worth the extra fun telling
all of it can you stop short of that
topic yes is it still just as great of a
movement if you just go to 135 degrees
instead of 90 or instead of all the way
up to 180 or whatever the fuck that is
yes there's no wrong answers here as
long as you at least clear parallel
and then a little bit higher is usually
better all the way up is not mandatory
but for us the extra front don't work is
totally cool and that essential control
on the way down is easier if you go all
the way up so give that some thought
[Music]
fast 12.
[Music]
[Applause]
let's take a little break after this one
finish two more when you're ready two
more when you're ready easy day today
yep
yep
slow
[Music]
oh
dude fuck fucker
fuck that almost hold dumbbells after
this it's a barbell good news great
how's this whole bummer author I don't
know I was hoping you didn't ask the
follow-up
let's go find us a barbell yeah
[Music]
look man I said hey we just I just did a
video on God doing biceps in the squad
rack shit
man
um only because pure muscle fitness has
about 75 squat racks so that's the only
time you're allowed to do biceps in the
squat rack Johnny we're not curling what
are you doing you just want a curl don't
you just let it just just
let a motherfucker curl up in here
but still is that considered is it an
accessory like this
considered these are upright rows we're
going to be pulling them to above the
face in height
and pausing at the top that allows us to
do is get a crazy amount of range of
motion use not so much load it is
insulting to the ego but that pause at
the top activates your side delts and
you keep them active in a slow
controlled eccentric on the way down
and because we're warm already for
you skeptical or some shit what's he
doing I can't see his face he's sick in
the head man yeah sick in the head so
I'm just gonna actually start my first
work set because we're already warmed up
for shoulders so consider this an intro
and set number one
like get off me baby I need space
well he sets the tone
it says the intensity standard
wow I can't wait to do these I used to
fear uh up by Rose due to a certain
someone so I avoided Jeff Cavalier we
can say it what you can watch our
channel so I'm kind of a noob at this
movement so uh let's see what this feels
like yes but you gotta stop at the top
and pause the visible pause it's gonna
be painful fuck yeah you feel that let's
go
yes yes and then slow let's go one more
Alex
Big Move
up up up up up up up up pause
slow
oh yeah it's like being punished last
