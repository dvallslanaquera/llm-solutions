i'm maddie mad dog forberg and for those
of you who don't know me i am a strength
coach and a 57 kilogram power lifter on
team usa
[Music]
i like that i can program into the rp
diet app what time i'll be training
and even if it's a light heavy moderate
kind of session and that will
you know differentiate the kind of
macros that i'll need and it can let me
put in how long my training session is
going to be
i use the rp diet app during all seasons
of power lifting whether i'm cutting
weight
bulking up or even right now maintenance
keeping on the same weight that i am
[Music]
we're back again rp plus welcome back dr
james dr mike
answering questions how are we doing
good how are you
i'm good i'm good can't complain my
movers still haven't fucking showed up
so i'm still pissed off
about that no yeah and they just like
don't call me back like i called it's
like
the guy i'm talking to is this russian
guy too and he always gets like real
flustered he's like oh shit
you you're the guy with the montana
right i'm like yeah he's like ah
those guys were supposed to call you
fuck fuck shit i'm going to call them
and then call you back and then i never
hear from them
amazing listen james you don't get
anything back anymore
your stuff are belong to us now that's
all that's how i feel i'm like i just
paid you to take my stuff away at this
point like
i'm never seeing it again you're gonna
have to have
a uh taken style movie about getting
your stuff back
it's called eastern europe and like used
in a whorehouse
like for people to bang on but like say
you're not there to rescue the
the prostitutes you're there to rescue
the couch furniture the beds and the
couches and shit
god you know what they should have never
ever stolen from you
that's where they have a very particular
set of skills
that's right needs analysis god all
right
ready yeah exactly very very useless set
of skills
ready okay
adrian denali says hey fellas question
regarding cardio in your opinions what
is the most effective modality and what
would you recommend
for someone into bodybuilding i always
thought high intensity of training was
the most beneficial
however i've heard from either you guys
or other pages that i follow that when
fatigue becomes a factor this may not be
the case
correct i've been really confused as to
which one would be more beneficial
this is also under the assumption that
diet doesn't check cardio is for burning
those few extra calories so i like i'm
glad you said those few extra calories
that narrows down the answer um also
interested in when you prescribe
specific types of cardio and to who are
for reasons
i.e why use high-intensity interval
training versus list in specific
situations
for specific athletes uh is there much
of a difference
for specificity reasons and finally
would you continue to perform cardio
even if you are to mass phase i
understand people like to maintain their
conditioning
but i don't plan on running any
marathons anytime soon this is more is
there a point
since i'm going to be gaining weight
regardless question so i'll answer or
give my answers and then james can uh
play cleanup for me as usual when i get
everything wrong
so number one the best kind of cardio
for bodybuilding is just getting a step
tracker on your watch
uh one of these and just uh setting
yourself a step goal that puts you into
moderately your high active
just make sure that doesn't fall off as
you lose fat in your fat loss phase
keep your steps up to a certain minimum
level or a certain average minus 12
000 steps a day anything between 10 and
15 000 is usually very good uh
and that will absolutely be because then
you can combine all the daily activities
like for example you go to the store and
you go shopping it counts that
so if you had a particularly busy day
there's no reason for you to be doing
extra cardio and extra cardio then can
be the four of walks
one really cool time strategy i like to
do is if james and i are just talking on
the phone
we're not talking through webinars i'll
just plug in my headphones and i'll talk
on my phone to james as i walk around
the neighborhood or walk around my
fucking house
and that's it like it's steps and it's
super super awesome
uh you can modify that with putting out
a weighted vest like james has done in
the past
under the impression both literature and
through uh james and many others
feedback that that works really really
well not mandatory but part of the
process that you can engage
if you're using a modality that's gym
specific i think something
like the elliptical is probably close to
optimum because you do
it's list style elliptical uh between
100 and 140 beats per minute no higher
than 140 beats per minute sustained
uh heart rate because anything higher
too high intensity will fatigue your
legs
and arms cool thing about the elliptical
or why it's probably the best if i had
to put my money on it now mind you
there's tons of caveats and tons of
individual variation and difference the
elliptical is not impact so it doesn't
do any kind of impact stress and it also
lets you use your upper and lower body
all the major muscles thereof so it says
spreads the cardio around to the most
stuff
allowing you to use all of your body's
slower twitch fibers and none of the
faster such fibers no localized fatigue
just generalized fatigue which is really
really good
so that's it and then incline walking
and trying to walk in and stuff like
that is pretty cool too
cycling's just fine especially if you
get outdoors on a real bike because
cycling indoors is maybe
worse than hell um high-intensity
interval training is uh some optimal for
bodybuilding because it's too
it's a cardio sfr and the stimulus in
that case is calories burned
ratio to the fatigue incurred is not
that great um
however the str using concepts in our
upcoming book at the end of the year for
my virgin
book the stimulus to time ratio of
calories burned the unit of time
is amazing for high intensity interval
training probably the best so to answer
your question about
who is high intensity interval training
for uh
it is folks that don't have a lot of
time but need to squash in the cardio
usually for health
like if i have somebody i'm training
who's like a 55 year old international
businessman or ceo something like that
he's like i have like
basically like 30 minutes every other
day to train at all it's going to be
compound alternating supersets
for lifting and high intensity interval
training for cardio a lot of times those
two are really kind of the same thing if
you think about it
so that is the answer to most of those
questions we'll see if i missed anything
uh oh yeah mass phase i i like just like
to keep
active on a mass phase and if you maybe
let's say do 12 000 steps
so so there's actually two potential
ways you can do this um
one is do more activity on your cutting
phase than on your masking phase that's
totally fine but you could just reduce
food on your cutting phase and because
your activity doesn't fall you're good
to go
another one is uh you just sort of keep
keep the same amount
and and don't reduce food uh sorry do
reduce food keep the same amount or you
can do more
but either way whatever you choose your
massing should also have a certain
number of steps tracked
and you should just keep active like
that if your steps per day are very low
and you'll see you drive to work work
sitting down in an office and then come
back
then yeah there's something to be said
for you potentially threading in some
cardio
i would say the cardio should just be
there uh you know in minimum amounts
for health maybe three to four sessions
of up to 30 minutes per week
no more than 140 each per minute heart
rate is the most i would do massing
otherwise if you really want to be
healthy or not get super fat and messing
probably just don't eat as much
uh and thus you have two problems solved
you don't have to stuff yourself anymore
and you don't have to do a ton of cardio
what i don't like to see is people take
like 50 cheat meals
tired of eating the food and also do a
ton of cardio yeah it's a fun way to eat
a lot
and do a ton of physical activity it's
great for your health but unfortunately
with true massing that gets really
really tough sometimes that eating is no
longer fun so don't don't be
you know people have been like hey i'm
doing tons of cardio on my mask i can't
gain weight i'm sick and tired of eating
i'm like boy do you have the easiest
solution in the world
just do a little less cardio and all of
a sudden things are going to be good so
that's my answer to all that james what
do you think
yeah that was really good um the the
middle question is the easiest one and
has the
greatest downstream effects on the other
questions so like why use
hit versus uh list is it a specificity
issue of course it's always a
specificity issue
bodybuilding is not a cardiovascular
sport at all right so
really the you're not doing it for an
actual cardiovascular enhancement
outside of
very very minimal health benefits um
you're just doing it as a glorified way
to just get some time to burn some extra
calories so
there's almost no incentive for
bodybuilders to do high intensity
interval training the only people who
need to do that are
high-intensity interval athletes really
that's what it boils down to and that's
just a specificity constraint at that
point
so i agree with all those other things
that dr mike said um
i would keep like a very very light
uh to mild cardio quota during massing
just for health purposes just just for
like i said very general cardiovascular
benefits for health
the other thing is um cardio is
is people adapt very quickly to cardio
modalities especially if you're using
the same modality all the time
like walking or whatever so there is a
good
um incentive to actually down
uh do less cardio during your mass so
that you stop becoming quite as
efficient while you are not needing to
be as efficient so that when you
actually start doing a lot of cardio
you're burning the actual energy that
you want to burn if you just keep like a
heavy dose of cardio all the time
you just end up getting really really
good at whatever that modality is and
then it starts to be less and less
effective in terms of burning calories
which is what you're using it for so
that's the big constraint there
all right clint m says
real quick um you have a ceiling fan on
over you by chance
yes could you would you mind turning it
off it's just making a very distracting
sound
no worries let me see if this fixes the
problem
one second and enjoy
looks like we lost him where did he go
[Music]
did that help um it's still
still there okay i'll just meet myself
when i'm not talking did you turn it off
or just turn it down
there's two fans one of them i need to
stay alive okay
gotcha um all right clint m
ready ready cool hello docs i'm the guy
that asked about chess growth as an
older person
a few weeks back and i wanted to say
thank you for all the advice 42 years
old three years of proper training
hit all muscle groups twice a week went
to three times a week for chest per your
advice and i've been noticing some
changes it's only been a few weeks
and i'm gonna cut so i know the results
will get better when i'm massing i won't
ask about overlapping soreness that
horse is dead
thank you appreciate it yeah my
questions
are number one how much should i really
worry about
my window uh for games due to my age
well
the actual answer is you shouldn't worry
about it at all because worrying exactly
exactly uh you just play the cards that
you're dealt but let's see what else you
say i played my hockey from five to 25
years old
but there wasn't a lot of weight lifting
involved so i had never been really
muscular but i was hope
i was in good shape until injuries
caused me to stop playing hockey things
were very
downhill after that and i didn't start
lifting until i was about 38.
i made great gains all over except chest
as mentioned i'll keep lifting
regardless of your answer because i
enjoy it but what do you guys think
about the gains would
age i think given your circumstance if i
had to bat when you would peak in your
total muscularity i would say it was
probably going to be around 50 years old
for you
uh because you're so relatively
untrained and
probably didn't suck at hockey so you're
not the world's worst athlete
the other thing too is you have to
differentiate the training age for the
different activities so you might have a
really high hockey training age but your
weight training weight training
training age is actually relatively low
so by those standards you're you know
some roughly in the intermediate
kind of range just based on your age
alone um
so i mean you got nothing to worry about
just keep training
and what what that means is that you're
still you're still going to be riding a
pretty steep curve on the the gain train
right you're not going to you you don't
have like
25 years of weight training experience
like you do in hockey there are two
different activities in two different
response
two different response systems so all
good
yep next question uh number two i've had
some patellar
slash femoral tendon issues from
squatting i train at home so only safety
bar squat external rotation loaded
permanently from shoulder surgeries
front squat and bulgarian split squat
and i'm going to rig up some kind of
belt squats soon
i found a good squat university vid that
has me spanish squatting with a band
box going 10 to 12 range in bulgarian
split squatting 10 to 12 range
top of the tendon issues it's been three
weeks of a six week meso
and the pain is nearly gone so i will
finish the meso this way and i'm asking
how should i return to squatting high
reps low reps
um slow reps pause reps what do you
think please god don't say more about
here and split scots i think you should
return to squatting
with uh lower reps but not super heavy
weight
it's not your primary exercise still use
the other exercises as primary ones put
squatting in as the last exercise in the
leg sessions
and do slow relatively low weight
full pause squats slow eccentric full
pause squats
and then if that goes well bump the
squats up a little heavier
uh go higher rep so something
challenging in the 10 20 rep range
and do again slow eccentric paused if
that feels great
take away this low centric pause and
then eventually several missiles later
you can come back to squatting heavy in
the five to 10 rep range
you're probably fine but that's
basically it you want to go nice and
slow at first not
challenging then nice and slow
challenging then challenging but no
longer nice and slow
uh normal cadence and then get all the
way back into heavy so that would be my
advice
i wouldn't actually go into um a new
squatting
activity at all i would continue doing
what you're doing for at least two more
mesos again and
and make sure that the pain free stays
that way because i tell you exactly
what's going to happen
you're like oh great i'm pain free after
a few weeks you're going to switch to
high bar squatting and that pain is
going to come
right back so keep doing what you're
doing for now until you have like two to
three mesos pain-free
consistently under your belt and then
consider swapping back to some other
more challenging squat exercises
and then i would do exactly what dr mike
said but my point is wait a little bit
before you do that
that's super great advice people always
want to jump back in and that's really a
bad idea in many cases
yeah it's like um it's like if you're a
crazy person and you're taking crazy
person meds
and you're like wow i don't feel crazy
anymore i won't take the meds right and
then what happens you go back to
crazytown
uh yes my childhood p.s
about a year back i had medial and
lateral epicondylitis in both elbows and
thought i was screwed i tried everything
i could to fix it then i saw a post of
mics about versagrips uses
i was at my wit's end i remember i
couldn't grab wet clothes from the
washing machine it hurts so bad
so i thought i'd give these versa grips
a try and have been getting better by
the mezzo for the last year best
invention ever
i agree game new lifters your deadlift
will go up a lot faster
uh than your grip so use versa grips
thanks doc uh thanks docs uh
dude honestly versa grips like uh i may
say this
say this on youtube all the time when i
recommend them i guess we are on youtube
i don't get paid a fucking dime i came
up to the versa grips reps at the arnold
and i was like hey i have a big
following
i would love to represent your brand for
free and they're like we don't do
brand reps and i'm like sweet anyway you
guys are the shit keep doing what you're
doing
but i'm going to continue to recommend
them because of the fucking shit versa
grips are a revolution
weightlifting shoes the weightlifting
belt and versa grips
i don't understand how people lift
without that shit uh a chalk
for for pushing movements uh and in in a
much later place but still honorable
mention is like wrist wraps
for heavy pressing movements but like at
least the first three of those it's just
like if you
the people who train legs are like i
don't know i don't feel my quads and i
get weightlifting shoes
people are like man like i want a squat
heavier but i feel like i'm not trying
my legs anymore put on a belt
and therefore people are like my grip
anything to do with grip anything at all
even if you don't think your grip is
limiting you buy versus gripping oh my
god
i can do like three more pull down reps
on every single fucking set
turns out my my lats were never in three
r or less for
pulldowns ever and i'm getting new gains
again it's insane reversal grips are the
fucking shit
i've had like a funny scenario with the
weightlifting shoes where i've had
clients and i'm
i'll say like make sure you use those
weightlifting shoes and they will and
then for whatever reason
they will stop using them and then i'll
i'll just come to know
yes exactly and they'll send me like a
video of them squatting and i'm like
where's your lifters and they're like
oh i felt guilty about wearing them like
what
put those fucking lifters back on what
are you doing yeah people say like well
it's just a crutch motherfucker
what are you talking about like you know
when
when a surgeon uses a robot to help him
assist with surgery like that's a crutch
dog you should be using that like what
the goal of the surgery is to save your
dumb ass not not use a robot the goal is
to get you jacked in the gym
look if you want to train for life go
run around in the woods and fuck animals
or something like that you know what i'm
saying
good god yeah totally i'm with you those
inventions are
there to help you and you embrace them
can you imagine seeing a guy at
superjack of the club
and you your girl be like oh man he's
got bigger arms than you and you're like
yeah but he probably uses like lifters
and uh
fucking burst nobody cares nobody gives
a shit no one cares
i'm all right here we go next one is
from jordan
says hey docs i hope you're all doing
well number one last week you mentioned
doing two exercises for muscle group per
session
you would take into consideration the
performance of the first exercise only
as a sort of true
truer indication of progress okay that
makes sense the second exercise
performance will always be muddied by
the local fatigue from the first one yes
and by the systemic fatigue of that
session as well
but how then do i judge adding volume
for the second exercise
when doing two movements per session i
will always compare performance for both
and add sets as needed
if that means barely adding volume to
the second one throughout the meso or at
least
definitely adding less so be it in my
mind that exercise is a second for a
reasonable priority okay so that's good
but i'm always doing it pre-fatigue so
the net effect percent should be higher
but i will rate and complete performance
of a first and second exercise and add
volume where needed where am i going
wrong here
you're going wrong by assessing the
performance of the second exercise at
all
you should not be doing that the first
exercise performance is the metric of
where you are in relation to your mrv
and are you past it or not
so that's the only there's so if
performance is up or it's not
down at the very least then you're good
to go you're good to add sets if the
other indicator is indicated
what are the indicators soreness pump
and so on and so forth
of how much work you're actually doing
are you getting an effective training
stimulus
that is those you can use for the second
exercise
uh specifically things like mind muscle
connection uh for example
if you do like three let's say you're up
to five sets of incline press and then
you
two sets of dumbbell flies after on the
fifth set of incline press
let's say last week you did five sets of
income press and two sets of dumbbell
flies after
this next week like overall your
performance and sort of everything says
add a set
to that workout where are you gonna add
it well
you look at this you're like after after
the fourth set of incline press last
week
i wasn't trying to fuck kill myself like
i i don't want to do any more fucking
sets of enclaves
and my elbows kind of hurt and by the
fifth set i don't even have in my muscle
connection to my chest i swear to god i
just want to die
right but you notice like two sets of
flies you're just getting going
man i wish you'd get a third sex feel so
fucking good right then
clearly you had a third set of flies so
that's actually our distinct
distinguishing logic there
is you always treat the first exercise
as the performance indicator
but you treat both exercises as where do
we add
our sets to and you add sets to
whichever one
seems to have the best sfrs if you would
add another set
it's kind of like uh it's almost exactly
this
my food analogies here but this analogy
holds
on on the base analogical level here you
eat a bunch of you got all you can eat
buffet you go get your first plate and
you eat it all
let's say you eat all the food right the
next plate you come in you add what are
you gonna add we're not gonna get any
more items that are shitty
the mashed potatoes was good it's not
that good i really want more mac and
cheese
like that's how you choose to add sex is
where do you think the stimulus to
fatigue ratio is gonna be best if you're
getting gnarly fucking pumps and great
mind muscle connection
from flies but incline is basically
fucking petered out don't add
any more incline until you got up to
another five sets of flies and then you
gotta add something and it's okay what's
the least worst thing i can add james
yeah and that's that becomes more of an
issue when you're looking at like mev to
mav progressions where you say like okay
i started with two and two
and i know i got to go up do i add if i
have two or three sets that i'm adding
this week do i put them all in the first
exercise or the second exercise or split
them up equally
it could be hard to figure out and so
usually what we'll say like dr my
already said
is pick the one that has the best sfr
generally speaking
kind of load that one up to the point of
which you don't really
or to the point where you can't really
add any more sets which is usually
around like five
for most people plus or minus and then
if you have any volume quota that you're
still working to fill up or
you're using the the set progression
algorithm thing then you can start
filling up some of those
other kind of ancillary exercises and it
doesn't have to be that way we just
think that's probably the most
efficacious way to do it
remember folks you use sfr the whole
time
after five james and i have observed
that after roughly five or we'd say five
to seven sets of the same exercise
further sets have a lower sfr potential
than new exercises like if i'm doing
five sets of bench press and i have a
choice due to a six set of bench or one
set of like weighted push-ups i choose
the weighted push-ups
because after that the bench is so
fucking stale that it was just a no-go
like the sfr there is dog shit
so sfr tends to depending on how you
calculate it but
the mind muscle connection and the feel
which is a good correlate of sfr
tends to peak usually between two and
four sets uh in for the exercise like
when you do the first set of the
exercise is probably not the best
feeling set your performance will be the
highest but it's not going to feel the
best
second set feels pretty good third set
usually feels fucking awesome
fourth set usually feels either the best
or second best after the third
fifth set man you know that's when you
start to feel like i could just not be
doing this anymore if that doesn't mean
the muscle's fucked up you could still
have plenty of muscular and systemic
ability to do it it's just it's really
starting to get stale
that's when it's usually time to change
some people can do five six seven sets
of stuff i haven't met anyone
who instead of doing four sets of squats
four leg processors like i'll just do
eight sets of squats like
okay and if that's really how you feel
hey follow your heart but it's just
unlikely to be true
yeah and that's another good point too
when you're talking about like mesodemes
progressions if you find that your first
movement for whatever exercise
is your mev is now at like five or six
where are you gonna go from there at
that point so you that's a good
indicator that that movement is
probably going stale or flat for you and
it might be worth thinking about another
exercise swap at that point if if it's
you know i'm not saying that five
can't be the mev for a movement but
that's where i would start
looking at that like oh you're starting
at five
if it takes five sets like to begin with
among other sets from other movements to
really get something going
at the beginning of a meso man you know
that movement probably sucks like that's
why i almost never that's why james uses
leg extensions a lot and why i almost
never use leg extensions
because for me like extensions it takes
like four or five sets to do anything
and so i almost never use it but if it
took two or three sets like it does for
james
to get a whole lot out of it of course i
would fuck with this yeah
and that's like a classic one is like
the one you just said you have like an
incline pressing
number one and then like a fly number
two and you're like i keep adding
incline pressing and it's like now i'm
up to six sets
but i do two sets of flies and i'm like
completely obliterated it's like oh okay
well
now you know next time maybe that fly
actually maybe could have been in the
first
slot you seem like it you're responding
way better to the fly you just didn't
know because this is the first time you
structured them that way
and that's fine and then the next
missile you can kind of play with it a
little bit if you need to
100 and jordan's the second question is
how bad would it be to totally exclude a
certain rep range 5 to 10 for traps
don't do dick for me
they beat me up with a little show for
it high rep ranges are amazing what is
your advice stitch to five to ten for
like six months then come back
uh around to it i cover all different
outrages for all muscle groups not
right from meso one of course but this
particular one has not been working for
me for a while as always appreciate your
help much
joy to your friends thank you don um so
i would say that i don't really have a
big problem at all
um abandoning a rep range as long as
you've given it due diligence and tried
it with different exercises
specifically for very small isolation
moves ones with tiny amplitudes
the total time the tension is applied
it's so small
and sometimes in the five to ten rep
range it's just not enough
work to have it be a good set um
so remember people say like um you know
anything under five reps
is not enough mechanical work um
not enough contraction time for your
muscles to actually become
you know relatively sort of exhausted
enough and really really activate all
the pathways that they need hypertrophy
and that's quite true but remember your
muscles also
they don't measure reps they measure
time like that chemical reactions occur
in in time and also distances that the
muscles
get to articulate and move so a lot of
times for many muscles the distance the
muscle moves is actually the same it's
just how it's arranged on the joint to
whether or not the joint articulation is
different
so with something like traps because
it's just here you can do a set of five
to ten in as long as it takes us to do a
set of
one or two in the squat like legit like
i can do a set of five to ten
it takes me like five seconds for traps
um
how long does it take you to do a full
one rep heavy squat like five seconds
right maybe two
two reps but we say two reps and
squatting is bad but your quads are
exposed to high tension
for just as long as the traps are so i'm
a big fan of like calves
traps forearms sets of five to ten are
fucking garbage
because they just don't expose the
muscles to attention for a significant
amount of time
i say for those that's 10 plus and
oftentimes sets of 20 to 30
work excellently there it's not because
it's a magic high rep thing it's the
same amount of total contraction time
just the amplitude is so small the reps
don't take as much time
yeah very good and in the specific case
of traps where you would get the five to
ten training would be from your compound
movements like if you're doing some like
bent over rows or something like that
now i said that and then i'm going to
also say
some muscle groups just tend to respond
a little bit better based on your
anthropometry and just based on their
position to different rep ranges
like for me doing heavy barbell rows i
just don't i don't if i do 5 to 10 i
just don't get a good thing going i have
to get up to like 10 above 10 for
something to really
be good could be just that that
particular muscle group could be me
could be a variety of things so
i think it's perfectly okay to just say
like okay well i did some heavy work
uh the traps were like a a contributing
muscle group to maybe these rows that i
was doing and i did sets of 10 on that
that covers you on that and then if
you're doing direct trap work like mike
said
some muscle groups just are easier to
train in like the 20 plus range and it
just works a little bit better
what's up next okay harrison catone
says eye doctors michael james just
finished listening to recovering from
training
uh james did you audiobook that
you know it dude that was the first one
we did
that's awesome gotta say dr james you
have a good voice for narrating books
oh i wish i had the the uh like the
sunglasses emoji for myself
thank you yeah that's awesome that's a
great compliment
anyway i have a few questions regarding
recovery and adaptation that don't
recall being covered in the book
would wearing static compression gear
negatively impact adaptation during
strength blocks i'm assuming there's a
difference between how the body adapts
hypertrophy training how the body adopts
strength training tens versus threes
uh therefore the does the small
hampering effect of the most
supplemental recoveries like cold heat
and compression
have towards hypertrophy also hamper the
adaptation process the body makes for
maximal strength
if compression does not hinder
adaptations for strength would you
recommend its use
during a strength flash peaking lock and
is there any reason why you
couldn't wear compression gear as you
sleep
yeah that's a really interesting
question so i think for strength
and we'll just say strength and power
purposes the effect is probably less
profound
um there are still muscular recovery
issues from doing those type from doing
that type of training
and i do think that it can and probably
will be impactful but because
strength and power adaptations are so
heavily based just in the nervous system
the performance decrement that you might
incur from using them is probably
much much less and again at that point
it might just be
more of a muscular issue not really a
truly like a strength issue so
i think uh it's probably okay i would
still be a little hesitant for people to
just like always be in the ice bath or
always have the compression stockings on
all the time just because they're like
oh it's a strength block it doesn't
matter anymore i'd be like yeah
maybe not um but i think it's definitely
a less impactful time to use it and i
think during like
a peaking block or like kind of a in
season kind of block
is probably the most appropriate time to
use them because you're really not
making huge
gains in fitness you're really just
elevating your preparedness you already
have fitness
you're just taking the fatigue down and
letting that fitness come out right so
in that case it's probably a pretty good
trade-off in terms of
the performance benefit that you get and
the long-term cost so in that case it's
good
for you know hypertrophy it's pretty
clear at this point that using those
things all the time is going to um
equal away at your gains a little bit
for strength i i don't think it's
it's it's as big of a deal it's
definitely something that i would be
cognizant of and cautious of with my
athletes like hey don't don't
be in the ice bath every day because
here's the other thing right if you're
if you're doing the ice bath or the
compression stockings every day why are
you doing that
are you doing it because you think it's
going to increase your performance
that will not happen does not increase
performance at all right
are you doing it because you're so
fucked up that you can't get to your
other
training sessions well what's the
problem there the problem is is that
that's not going to fix it you got to go
back to the drawing board and look at
your volume landmarks looks at your
volumes frequencies and intensities
that's just a band-aid on a much bigger
wound that you have to
address so um and then the last one i
think was can you just kind of set it
and forget it if you're wearing the
compression gear yeah absolutely that's
the best that's the best part about
wearing the compression stockings is
that you don't have to really do
anything you just put them on
they passively work i uh when i would
get
excuse me a little froggy today when i
would get elbow tendinitis flare-ups
i would put them on like during the day
and i'd leave them on at bedtime and it
it would help it would definitely help
it would definitely be a noticeable
difference um so yeah you can just put
them on while you sleep
[Music]
very cool uh next question since heat
negatively affects
the adaptation process plus training
would a warm but not above 36 celsius
bath
be a recommended method for relaxation
so it's it's not necessarily that it um
you could you could make a case that it
actually
enhances the adaptation pro process in
some way so it's not necessarily that it
negatively affects the adaptation
process post-training
um but like uh though the big issue
there is managing things like edema and
stuff like that now there is there are
some again there there's the typical
recovery adaptation trade-off that you
do make
in some cases it's actually um the heat
does provide a
kind of an anabolic effect but the net
effect ends up being like a slight
loss because with the heat you get
increases in blood flow
which is good for nutrient uptake waste
removal so that's good
um but not not exclusively good not
exclusively bad kind of thing
the the key with the heat and this is
covered in the recovery book
i can't remember the exact numbers is
that the
the heat has to penetrate deep enough
into the muscle tissue so the external
temperature
at the skin has to hit some threshold in
order for it to sufficiently penetrate
into the muscle and elicit that effect
so something like a warm
uh bath may not have that same problem
actually the warm bath
might be very relaxing it might not come
with the same problems of like blowing
up edema and stuff like that
not sure um but definitely it's a good
idea from the perspective of
relaxation i would uh the thing is like
mike you can you can chime in here how
many people are going to take like a
lukewarm bath versus
a like a hot bath right if you're
deliberately doing it for the purposes
of relaxing uh that would just be like
i don't know it's just flicking your
dick instead of
masturbating it's just one of those like
weird also might not be very situations
right it's just you're like this sucks
why don't i just take a nice
hot bath and that's what's really going
to get me relaxed and feeling good uh
like i just took
when when when we had guests over for
fourth of july including dr mike and
crystal
somebody had done something and i had to
take like a fucking lukewarm shower and
i just remember thinking like how
bad because it's not that it's like
taking a cold shower where it's like
this sucks
it's just like a tease right like this
could be so much better but it's not
for sure and i think like you said the
hypertrophy interference would have to
be
for a very very hot exposure so a normal
bath
or hot tub that's relaxing is probably
going to be net enhancing to muscle
growth
especially if it lets you relax but
don't think it's magical like something
sometimes people do things
like cold shit or whatever it doesn't
relax them it's annoying
and they think like it's gonna help me
heal right no it's not gonna help you do
dick just relax it's
really number one like james and i our
secret recovery modality post training
is to fucking grab a meal and sit down
on a couch and eat it while watching
your favorite tv show like there's
nothing really beats that shit other
than like
a blowjob by a professional uh but yeah
i've deviated human beings
right i've deviated my routine so i'll
uh work out for oh like wake up
pump up drink fill out my like daily
planner as i'm like
as the pump up drink is kicking in
usually i also have to take a huge giant
pump up drink shit
then i'll go lift come back do my post
workout meal and then if if the timing
is good for the day i try to do
um one of the practices on the sam
harris waking up app
and that's been like a really nice
routine because it forces you to sit
down and like be
very calm and relaxed so it's a very
it's a good good combo so highly
recommend
all right next question from harrison
catan
uh finally for sleep is there any
evidence that supplementing melatonin
negative reflects the sleep adaptation
process
with melatonin i like oh negative
effects adaptation process i'm going to
go just go ahead and say no on that one
james correct me if i'm wrong
no no it's not not as far as i'm aware
and then not specifically like training
related adaptations as far as i know uh
it says with melatonin i like how
quickly i'm able to fall asleep with it
i usually find
it easier to wake up in a more uh alert
post waking however i do find that it
shortens the time in which i naturally
sleep
for instance i fell asleep at 9 30 p.m
sunday and woke up naturally at 3 30 a.m
monday morning
i then went back to bed until 6am before
supplementation i usually sleep
eight hours or a little under without an
eruption do you have any tricks for
staying asleep longer apart from just
the brute force of trying to form a
habit of sleeping
longer um zma's been really good to me
for that now i've said that a couple
times on the webinars it's not for
everybody
um i take the normal dose is like taking
three of the capsules i take
one and then once i fall asleep i am out
nothing's waking me up and the downside
of that is you usually wake up
kind of groggy and you kind of have a
slow start to the day which is kind of a
shitty way to start
but once you kind of get through that
hump then you feel very normal and
refreshed but
that's been one that i i don't like to
pander the supplement stuff
it's just one that i've had good
experience with and i know other people
have
if uh the issue is not so much falling
asleep but staying asleep
that's when it's it works great and
you'll have really vivid crazy dreams
i had one the other i had like i i'm
like
am i batting 70 percent on the dreams
we're like
70 of the time they're fine and then 30
of the time it's like a stressful or
nightmare situation
and it's awful so be advised it's
there is that it's like having a bad
dream that you can't wake up from and
it's very vivid
yeah last webinar you mentioned that
coming off creatine before me to hold
less water would be a bad idea for
powerlifting could you explain why
because creatine makes you stronger and
it changes your leverages if you lose a
lot of body water
um is it simply you'd be lighter yes
that's also a problem
it's my understanding the create
supplementation helps in restoring atp
levels and thereby allows you to train
more overloading sets versus someone
who's not supplementing
i don't see how in tapering processor
and meat that its benefits would be that
useful
i'm not trying to be cocky just
inquisitive of course we never never
thought you're trying to be cocky and it
would be fine if you were
um i think creatine has a very slight uh
effect on back to back rep performance
um even in very short durations so
actually you have three squat attempts
and
three bench attempts and three deadlift
attempts count warm-ups with that and
creatine can
actually help you make sure that you get
your absolute best out of meat
uh secondly my bigger problem is the
water
in the muscle and the leverage problem
so if your muscles are more dehydrated
from coming off
creatine there's a short adapter window
there why i wouldn't want to push
weights super super heavy
because it could lead to injury a little
bit more likely and also you're
leveraged
differently and you weigh differently
and all of a sudden the bar doesn't fit
in your hands like it used to your squat
creases don't fit like they used to
bench setup isn't what
what it was deadlift setup isn't what it
was just by small millimeters that can
affect it so don't change
anything coming into your meat uh less
that's the bigger issue yes don't change
anything right that's the whole point is
like you
you're going into your meat and
everything should be like rock solid i
don't have to switch anything i've done
this
tried and true no problems routine habit
why why do you want to change whatever
it is that you're doing that's just
adding so much variation into the
equation
another really good thing about creatine
is it holds body water but you can still
drop body water as easily or even more
easily if you do a water cut
and you can get it back more easily
because the creatine's there ready to
nab all the body water for you
so if you're like three pounds off keep
taking the creatine keep being three
pounds off
cut three pounds before the meat weigh
in re-bloat three pounds back and you'll
be full and strong and have all the
advantages
like creatine basically does everything
your muscles do it's like having more
muscle
so don't get rid of your muscle you need
it for powerlifting
yeah absolutely and don't change shit
while you're going into peaking
everything should be
lockstep at that point and he says also
i watched
dr james rb plus series on developing an
annual plan i really enjoyed it i'm
currently working on developing one now
and it definitely helps to see it all
out in front of me one change that i saw
i needed to make was changing my plan of
doing an 11 week
mass meso to doing a 12 week one trying
to nicely
uh fit two or three mouth cycles into 11
weeks either made one measure too long
for me to train without a dealer or too
short
for much overload but 12 works perfectly
for
three four regular mesos thanks awesome
harrison
[Music]
that looks like some some celtic shit
right there right
i want to like act like conor mcgregor
and do fisticuffs and punch someone in
the face when i see your last name like
i almost look at looking at that it
almost makes me think of saying it like
satan
it is like you know what i mean
leprechaun
that's funny yeah i'm glad you enjoyed
the videos one man
oh leprechaun in the hood again
all right zhao chen liu
says hi dr michael joshua james i find
that my muscles get much better pumps
and more sore the next day when i use
exercise and emphasize
load at the various stretch positions
such as rdls and flies compared to leg
curls or bench press hey good news
those have also been shown to cause more
hypertrophy isn't that strange
loading at the stretch position
correlates with soreness and
pumps however dr mike has mentioned that
one of the benefits of footage of motion
is the stimulus for large portions of
the muscle fibers
than partial reps i'm wondering if using
exercise that emphasize stress in a
contracted muscle position such as cable
crossovers and light curls
will hit different fibers compared
exercises that put more emphasis on the
stretch state shifts to rdls and bench
they absolutely will but only by a small
margin
most full contractions actually hit the
entire uh almost you know 97 of the
motor units but there will be some
slight differences absolutely correct
in that regard for someone who does high
rep training
sets of oh oh that was the only question
so yes james any uh addenda
uh and that's just uh i agree with dr
mike and
that's just one of the also the side
benefits of variation is just
not only are you emphasizing different
fibers with different
different regions of force within other
fibers that's why having
you know i want to say a variety of
exercises but not just having like one
or two
exercises if you're intermediate it's
probably a good idea because those
exercises
are literally training the muscle in a
different way and what that effectively
means for hypertrophy is
training different fibers within the
muscle and training different regions of
force within the muscle and something
like your pec
is like a big fucking muscle right that
goes all the way up into your armpit and
stuff
so you can imagine that there's going to
be all sorts of different uh
positions and fibers that are activated
by those positions through different
training methods so that's a good reason
to do it
yep absolutely next question for someone
who does
higher upsets uh higher up training sets
of 50 to 60
with addition of bodybuilding training
sets 10 to 20 with a high volume low
intensity work such a blind weight
squats push-ups hinder their
hypertrophic growth significantly if
they
have the recovery on point have been
exposed to higher upward for many years
yes absolutely that's
uh you could spend uh that's first of
all there's direct
chemical pathway interference and second
of all there's recovery you could have
put
towards the training that you're putting
towards expenditure instead
and that latter point would apply to
anything else too like it's the same
idea it's like okay well
could i do you know like figure skating
would that interfere with hypertrophy
like
yes what about baseball yes what about
name it you name it if your goal is to
be as the most hype
to get the most hypertrophy possible
anything that's not hypertrophy training
will interfere in terms of
the actual uh training stressors mrv
stuff like that
or simply just opportunity cost time
spent doing something else or time not
recovering from the training that you're
already doing so
that one's kind of more of a universal
thing
everyone recommends using a lordosis
spine when deadlifting
you know what uh everyone doesn't
recommend that dr
mike and i typically do but uh
most people seem to push back on that i
would say the majority of people seem to
push back on that do you agree
yeah uh most people recommend an average
a neutral spine and
we tend to skew a little bit lordotic
and some other people a little bit more
cathodic but let's see where this
question goes
do you think it could be beneficial in
doing some rounded back doubles using
very manageable loads being very careful
sort of like flexion rows but without
throwing part of using more lower back
than mid back for injury prevention
um i think the flexion rows can do all
of that
very well um i think changing your
device technique from one to the other
is an interesting choice i don't know
what exactly
the injury prevention benefits would be
from that unless you plan on getting
way out of your technique on your normal
weight deadlifts with a neutral spine
but if you get out of neutral spine with
500 pounds
not a whole lot of what you did work
with two 225 pounds is going to come in
handy at that point because the forces
would be outrageous
so maybe it can a little bit but i don't
see a reason why you can't do something
like that with flexion rows and various
other things but yeah potentially round
back deadlifts
can be fine not really to prevent injury
but just to strengthen your
uh erector speeding muscles and to
hypertrophy them and i think that can
absolutely be done with round back
deadlifts provided the weight is low
i prefer flexion roads because that
actually involves um
you know very very dedicated and very
more isolated
exposure like that essentially if you do
round back deadlifts
that's a lot of junk volume for your
quads and glutes because they're
basically not stressed at all and it's
just your back
why don't you just do flexion rows and
get tons of lat activation too
or do 45 degree back raises with your
hips behind the pad so that it's only
your back
flexing and curling and then you just
get erectors only i wouldn't involve
tons of other muscles that have nothing
to do with anything
and i'll throw off your technique as
well i i agree on all counts
that's just a ton of junk volume first
of all because now you're not getting
stronger in the legs or in the in their
back really
at all compared to the loads that would
cause you to get stronger
it's also unclear that it would be
preventative of injuries in any way so
to me that's just like a huge
waste it's just like a waste of an
exercise i am a little bit more uh
conservative on the roundback deadlifts
i would say i personally don't
would not program that for someone and
if somebody said james what do you think
about me doing this
i'd be like no yeah sorry i'm not trying
to say that you were either i was just i
would
i would just say no like i would give
more of a flat no answer on that just um
because it also was like reinforcing
poor technical aspects of the lift and
it's just
it's harder to unlearn a bad habit than
to just start with good habits and
maintain good habits so that's
i don't see a big incentive to do that
that doing you know good technique
controlled regular deadlifts and
supplemental exercises like the
modified 45 degree the flexion rose like
dr mike said those
that would all seem fine i just don't
see an incentive to do that
last question here for zhao chen
if concentric decentral muscle actions
are superior for hypertrophy than
isometric actions wouldn't deflection
road be better for erector growth and
deadlifts
ignoring the fact that one uses much
higher poundages for deadlifts than
flexion rose
possibly result that the growth of
isometric contractions deadlift offered
equally greater
growth to the central concentric
stimulus and the low poundage inflection
rows i'm asking purely on the movement's
standpoint
uh if flexion rows are superior would it
be detrimental to the lower back slash
my sister's less nerves
vice flexion roses the main staple
exercise to target the lower back
uh targeting more of a lower back than
the mid-back
no i think it's totally fine flexurals
are very safe um
i think that stimulus to fatigue ratio
flexion rows beat deadlifts any day of
the week for growing the erectors
um from rusting this magnitude like you
intimated it's probably about
even or bad let's even win that comes at
a massive fucking fatigue cost
um and if i was trying to bring up my
erectors
specifically i would probably use a lot
of flexion rolling i don't think there's
anything wrong with that
yeah it wouldn't be my my first choice i
would usually opt for
just kind of like the more of the basic
compound stuff but that doesn't mean
that i would exclude it either i don't
it just wouldn't be my first personal
choice if somebody was like i want to
get a big back i'd be like let's start
with deathless
right like uh especially like they meant
like they're erectors um
and then flexion rose could be a
supplemental movement 100 no
issue there sure for sure for sure
all right steve blair hey docs after
uh years of very slow progress due to
being afraid to put on weight i finally
managed to commit to a bulk commit to
the bulk oh yeah
i'm coming to the end period that would
be funny right
um if you do enough bulking you will
come back
i'm coming to the end of my third
straight hypertrophy meso and i've put
on about four kilograms in 15 weeks
what is that like nine pounds that's
pretty good after this week i'll be
deloading
and then doing a three upgrades
re-sensitization mezzo and maintenance
i'm undecided what you do after it
though one part of my brain say
do a quick four week mini cup followed
by another three months of bulking
well another saying that's your adipose
phobia talking ride the momentum go
straight back into bulking after
resensitization
while a third part of my brain is saying
don't listen to that stupid second part
you just don't want to diet a quick mini
cup won't harm momentum too much
i would actually side with number three
uh james
same excellent i love it when we're just
like
we're like on pacific rim when they
fucking gel
goddamn with the pacific river you shut
the fuck up james i brought it
doctor mike go go go no tell him
oh no we were just hanging out for
fourth of july i don't even remember why
it came up
dr mike was on like some he was like
trying to make like a very uh prolific
point and then he was like
it's like you know in pacific rim and i
was like why are we talking about
pacific rim it's so it was like a
serious conversation and then somehow
pacific rim got paid
exactly not now i remember what it was
it was uh
like uh crazy sjws who like want coveted
19 to be the end of the world
uh they want it to be their struggle
they just like
it defines like it's a warlike state
that it defines meaning like there's
good people and bad people there's a
clear enemy and finally some fucking
meaning in my life
that was referencing like pacific rim
it's like the monsters are coming we
have to build these walls we have to
mobilize and it's like fuck all that
shit i wish the monsters just never came
right
so in any case it was a stupid point
then it's a stupid point now
nonetheless the pacific rim analogy
holds quite well
i might add so um anyway which by the
way the pacific rim is a monumentally
stupid movie
and they're like did they make a sequel
too yeah dude fuck yeah i saw the sequel
too
they're like uh it's a great plane movie
you know like i have to kill
three hours like done um so like
the the way they explained it is like
you gotta like the max like too much
nervous system for you it'll fucking
fire your brain if you try to fucking
drive the load you gotta mesh and use
both brains but that's the stupidest
shit in the world the mac moves like a
fucking person it actually moves less
there's less articulation at the joints
you can't do this with the mech
you can do that with your own fucking
nerves who the fuck designing this thing
fire that guy
get a guy to build a mech that just
translates normal human movement oh my
god it'd be the best thing in the world
fuck out of here fuck out of here
but the japanese crab monster that was a
fucking cool monster i was scared
i love monsters i love the crab theme
stuff yes anything crab related
and japan related good times yes so
we we watched uh anime last night with
uh
chris chris bugged out right away he was
like
no we're not doing this and but uh doug
and
myself we and then mel hung up i'll hung
out for most of it yeah it was good
pro mare doug's a champion doug never
fucking box out
all right it was so funny sorry we tried
to watch it the other night
and i was like dog you ready to watch
the movie and then mel like jumped in
and she was like let's not watch that i
was like doug and i really want to watch
this movie and she was like let's watch
exclusively what i want to watch and we
went back and forth and we were like
fine we give up
and then then like later the next day
doug was like yo james
you still want to watch that anime i was
like yeah we made a point to be like
we're watching it
yes man cave anime watching
yes uh all right he said uh okay
you probably you can probably tell i've
been on a lockdown for three months with
no one but myself to talk to
anyway my question is how much impact
would a short mini cut
actually have i'm blocking progress
looking at myself in the mirror i'm not
desperate need of a cup
but if it's not going to do much harm
then mini cutting now means a shorter
cut later
or longer to keep bulking since i can't
stop second guessing myself for the best
course of action i'd welcome any advice
other than stop talking yourself
continue to talk to yourself do it under
your breath because if you do it in
public
out loud it tends to uh throw people
into some kind of discordance absolutely
uh yeah james and i think are both big
fans of that
option number three if you feel up for
it yeah there's no real there's no real
incentive not to do it either because it
won't
interfere with your um your mass
momentum
if anything if there's are any negative
uh effects they're going to be washed
out by the massive positive effect that
you reap when you switch back to massing
uh so i don't really see a reason not to
just like use the same movements you did
in the last mass yeah just try to keep
the performance on them the same
and then when you switch gears to
massing your performance on them is
gonna fucking start skyrocket again and
if it peters out just switch movements
you're good to go
all right payton downs hello gentlemen
my back is still sore from last back
session and i have slds today
is it going to impede my long-term back
development if i do the slds with a
sworpa back once or twice know if it's a
consistent thing i would re-alter your
plan
and some some some things you can kind
of get away with with the
some some movements like for example
like if it's like your your mid-back
you might not have a huge problem but
like if it's your lats
holding the bar in position on the sldl
is really like a is really is
surprisingly hard on the lats and so
that will have like a very tangible
performance decrement
on that particular movement so i would
say you might want to play with it
not play with it but just monitor it see
how it goes if if your back soreness
doesn't actually
impede your performance it might not be
a huge deal at all for myself
i know that like i cannot do pull-ups
the day before sldls
just because of that that effect of the
the last so
you will have your own unique you know
circumstances around that so just
monitor it and observe it for now and
go and see where it goes this is one of
the reasons why james and i are not fans
of altering frequency
within a meso it can be done but it's
tough because then it's kind of like
well
i was doing everything and it was
healing on time and then i stuck sldls
in here now
it fucked everything in the ass like i'm
not healed enough to do sodls i have to
change my rows
and then after the sldls fuck me up for
everything else and blah blah blah so it
goes down the train
um all right i can't believe this
question is being asked because this is
some shit i wanted to rant on for
fucking forever
here we go number two
[Music]
james i just looked ahead and i was like
i can see where this is going
it's great because your laugh was
computer slowed into robot voice which
is even even better oh perfect timing
yeah uh number two what are y'all's
thoughts on the future of genetic
engineering of unborn babies
uh do y'all think it's ethical and good
for mankind
so i will give you my very humble
opinion
it's not only is it ethical and good for
mankind
i could probably put together a decent
donut bulletproof
argument given that that technology
exists it may be unethical
to not use it for the love of fucking
god it is just an extension
of mankind's reach it is just an
extension of the ability to do
better when you get a vaccine the virus
the vaccine fucks with your dna
that's a good thing god damn it that's
what you want
like nature has given us tons of really
cool things so you know fucking eyes
that work in a mouth that works like hey
thanks
cheers to that but it's given us a ton
of shit that's fucking sucks and
you don't want and we could do fucking
better so there's no distinction in my
eyes between putting air conditioning in
your house
and putting different genes in your body
to make yourself better
like can you fucking imagine if your kid
comes out
you know with you know with some kind of
congenital disease and he's like hey
like you know i guess right
life so you know when he becomes of age
at 10 years old he's like i guess life
is tougher for me than other kids be
like well you know what billy
we could have engineered that disease
right out of you but we chose to keep it
in because that's fucking you know what
i'm saying that's god's plan
what the fuck what the fuck like that is
nuts right
is should genetic engineering be very
very well tested for it to be safe of
course but how many parents do you think
would fucking even choose to do that
unless it was vetted like crazy
it's gonna be crazy vetted i that's my
big problem is i
think the regulatory apparatus and
modern economies or modern governments
is going to have a real hard time
accepting shit like that so we'll go to
china or fucking vietnam to do that shit
or some
like you know crazy unregulated place
you better believe i'm gonna fucking go
there for my kids or grandkids or
whatever the fuck
um it's a fucking awesome thing of
course it's perilous
but i'll tell you that leaving shit to
nature is way more fucking perilous
than trying to slowly but surely and
marginally improve things genetic
engineering my last point
second to last point last point is the
most important thing your possible
engineer is higher levels of
intelligence high levels of intelligence
as human beings on average
let's say we already know what the
genetics are of people who have an iq of
160 right top end
of most scales because those people are
around just probably not that big of a
mystery
if we peg everyone born after the year
2040
to 160 adult oh my fuck oh my god we
have a fucking world of yale graduates
everything gets fucking infinitely
better do you know how many bad things
happen because people are not
sufficiently intelligent any policy
problem
any disagreement you have politically
with everyone with anyone
is probably 90 due to them just not
being fucking smart enough to understand
what the fuck is going on
so that and then lastly it's not clear
which one will
become more ascendant genetic
engineering of humans or
the coming explosion or artificial
intelligence and the synthesis
of artificial intelligence and human
intelligence to eventually upload human
brains
onto computers and then expand their
architecture so on and so forth i
personally think if i had to guess
that the um computer shit is going to
come a little bit faster than the
genetic shit the genetics she won't
really get going and the computer shit
will come before which is sweet fuck
let's skip genetics all together just go
straight to robot bodies
uh and crazy crazy hyper intelligence
but yeah as soon as genetic
an engineer of any kind comes along i
think it's fucking awesome to use it and
allows you to you don't like grocery
stores you don't like air conditioning
you don't take vaccines when they give
it to you
uh you agree with us already and if you
don't like those things
sweet enjoy an early fucking death after
a shitty life james
i i pretty much exclusively agree with
dr mike though i uh
so like some of the things seem obvious
right like the medical screening and
stuff like that like like we can remove
genetic
diseases and all these horrible things
you know like parkinson's disease or you
know
alzheimer's and things so that you never
have to deal with that again that seems
like an obvious thing
i think where people find it unethical
is the potential for like um
kind of how people get sensitive about
things like wage gaps where they say
okay well
if it's privatized and it's not a
government regulated thing then you're
just going to have people who can afford
to get
um genetic modification and then it's
going to become like a weird
um class form of eugenics
more or less because you have like a
very small subset of the population who
are
getting infinitely better and people who
can't afford that service are going to
just stay where they are
i don't i don't buy into that i'm just i
i can see
why somebody might find that to be
unethical i i agree with
what dr mike said i don't i don't see a
problem with it but i i acknowledge that
some people might not like that idea
totally there's lots of discussion to be
had there
clearly outside the scope of this
webinar about the nuances especially how
to present some things to others you
know like
more smart people in this world actually
helps the stupider people in this world
it doesn't hurt them
uh and you know like if you want
equality to keep everyone stupid
i'm just gonna cheat flout the law and
get smarter than you
you know revolt you know what i'm saying
trying to keep people stupid
doesn't work in the long run probably
probably the better argument to say okay
let's let the super rich people get as
smart as possible but also
put in you know some kind of mild
taxation or some sort of like that which
we already have by the way
to try to get this technology cheaper
and cheaper so that even the poorest
folks can get some intelligence
improvement which would be fucking
amazing you know maybe you're not going
to be a fucking
mind god but you could have an iq of a
current great scientist today
oh fuck i'll take that i'll take
anything right or even just like okay i
might not be a mind god but i i won't
have alzheimer's disease like
great for sure we all win right there uh
i will say that one promising thing
about genetic engineering is uh the fact
that we have tons of different countries
different governments
uh if it's banned in certain places some
places are gonna start doing it and once
they get good at it the people that are
just gonna be fucking better
and then people in all the other
countries are gonna be like why the fuck
do i have that it's gonna be an arms
race
yeah it's like trying to keep capitalism
under a lid like you know after thailand
like
doubled its gdp in 10 years between 1990
and 2000 all the other countries around
like why the fuck are we still
socialists they're just like yeah that's
like do a little bit more market shit
because like i want that
so it's because you don't you don't have
to sell it it sells itself but
yeah totally all right so funny
discussion yeah yeah
[Music]
you're muted my friend sorry i muted
myself
there you go then begin talking last
question here from
peyton i understand the stress increases
while you're on a long cut but i have
personally felt slightly depressed
have y'all ever experienced that i am
mentally healthy don't worry it's only
slightly i understand that it will go
away once i get finished
thank y'all thank you all that's about
what i'm saying
this webinar helps me get through this
assignment overseas oh i didn't know you
were assigned to her skis
um stay safe if depending on what kind
of assignment it is
don't die don't kill anyone unless you
have to kill people and then do so
judiciously
um yeah man join the club bro cutting
fucking sucks yeah you will be a little
bit depressed now
make sure the rest of your life is doing
good and try to find other ways to be
happy
um because you know sometimes like some
kind of mild depression can sneak up i
do you can think it's the cut but it's
really not
make sure your life is going generally
direction you want you're not in like
toxic relationships your career is going
on the right path etc etc but
honestly man you know massing is fun
times for a fucking reason
um the the best summary of the
trade-offs of asking cutting ever i've
ever heard it's
like uh from dennis james bodybuilder
and for some reason he had the ability
at least in this case to put something
so succinctly like like
why would you put something so simply if
we could nuance blather about it for two
hours
here because they're like what what do
you think they asked him like what's
what's your what's your deal with oh
there's somebody behind you
sounds good fuck off bye
is that mel oh yeah i don't know um
montana yikes um
they're like what do you think like is
good and like
you think about like massing and cutting
what's like kind of like your take on
the tube
like emotionally which one do you like
best he goes cutting's great
because you get to look better all the
time but you feel like shit
uh that's the bad part and masting is
great
because you get to eat whatever you want
but you look worse and worse the entire
time and i was like
there it is there it is so because
people always
like want one to be categorically better
and it's like cutting is great because
you get to look better a lot gets done
you get to sort of like cutting is the
ultimate delayed gratification
yeah during the cutting you sort of
don't even look that great yet but you
feel kind of
a little depressed and then at the end
of cut you start to build that momentum
like oh my god this is awesome
cut ends you're lean and then you can
dope that leanness out for as long as
you like it will give you more happiness
while you get to eat tasty food
or you can really up the happiness
breathing lots of tasty food massing and
losing
leanness so on average your happiness is
just about the same
uh but higher because you're
incrementally putting on muscle over
that time or incrementally decreasing
fat so over the medium term yeah you
will feel a little bit more sad
when you're not eating the fucking shit
you like and also you just the brain
doesn't have enough energy to be happy
for the love of god like brain defaults
to like meh
kind of like bulldog mode when you don't
have when you're on cutting calories
your brain does the bulldog thing was
like it just sits there and then like
that's not a very happy place to be
although
i think bulldogs might be happy who
knows i can't tell yeah it's it's normal
for
like neuroticism to go up during a cut
it's like
you're starving you're working really
hard it's completely fine to have like
increases in like more negative thoughts
and emotions don't don't let it get you
down
it's temporary just like most negative
emotions are
yeah like the first day of my cut i walk
out the street i'm like i'm gonna
fucking kill everyone
all right um sean meyer has edited and
said that before
this uh before uh posted this before
finding the needs analysis and face
potentiation lectures on rp plus
so you can skip this question if you
would like love the content so we're
gonna skip your question
uh sean uh great job james with those uh
lectures
so all right glad you enjoyed yeah yeah
um and actually
sean um keep your eyes peeled we're
gonna
so the book that jake chad and i are
working on we're gonna have a draft zero
in august and um then it's going to go
to
the authors including mike uh for kind
of content related author edits and then
we'll go through the normal
rp process but that book will uh
probably in the next year or two
come out and really be beat that
question to death
all right next up is aaron amay
it's like it looks like it would be
almighty if i had to read it fast
hello doctors you may or may not recall
that a while ago i asked you about your
theories for entry into the field of
sports science thank you for your
insights because of your advice i signed
up for anatomy and physiology
and an exercise science course which i'm
taking right now chooses prerequisites
for my entry into a grad school i'm very
interested in the etsu strict
commissioning online master's program
because it's more affordable for an
out-of-state resident if you have any
thoughts about this i would love to hear
them
specifically about the etsu online
master's program and certain
conditioning james thoughts
um careful i don't want to i don't want
to say too much on this i would say
there are other options that are
potentially worth exploring yeah it's a
good option maybe not the only option as
well
um and then since these are summer
courses i have to go in depth on some of
my topics on my own and i'm trying to
learn as much as possible
so i have a few questions regarding
lactate threshold energy systems overlap
principle of orderly recruitment and
critical power
sorry if my questions are messy i'm
trying to make sense of a lot of
concepts at once well
james this is kind of cool we're like uh
his like teaching assistants this is
really tricky it's like having students
out again oh fuck
god damn it i gotta stop start making uh
finalized materials for brad
schoenfeld's courses online
but slacking off god damn it
for the principle of orderly recruitment
my textbook says that
more fibers are activated with
increasing force or duration of physical
activity
an example they used is the end of a
marathon where most of the type 1 and 2a
fibers make your fatigue type 2x can be
stimulated to continue exercise
my understanding the fatigue happens
primarily because of glycogen depletion
these faster fibers are not very well
equipped to deal with massive level of
cellular respiration
so wouldn't the race pace as a
percentage of ao2 max need to decrease
drastically to cope with the switch
to faster fibers it wouldn't need to
decrease at all
your faster fibers give out and then it
would need to decrease so the faster
fibers are used incrementally more and
more and more
if you run a proper race they never use
too much to where they peter out so your
pace can be identical
if you sprint too fast in the middle
then you will absolutely peter out and
just be
walking the rest of the time ideally the
way to do it is to keep the pace the
same
in the in visual distance of the finish
line speed up to basically a half sprint
using all the fucking fibers in your
body and then collapsing at the finish
line
james yeah so the principle of orderly
recruitment is kind of a um
a hybrid of some other concepts that are
a little bit more concrete the first one
being henneman size principle which
deals with how
uh motor units and muscle fibers and the
types of fibers
start to change depending on the
activity and what it basically means is
if you have kind of like very
low force low power activities you use
very small muscle fibers and they're
typically more type one
and as the intensity of that activity
increases
you start recruiting incrementally
larger and larger fibers and then move
into some of the bigger more fast twitch
fibers as you go
so that's the first one and then the
second one is really more of kind of a
fatigue issue where when you have some
muscle fibers that are kind of
approaching their
their failure point for various reasons
whether it's a biochemical
or things like that we start to increase
the motor units that are
available even if they are not the best
choice but that is kind of like dr mike
said the last ditch effort because
once you start tap once your type ones
are becoming largely tapped out
and they have to actually start using
some of the other ones like type two to
contribute that is basically you're on
you're on your muscles deathbed because
once those kick in
you got you're on it's a time bomb that
you're not gonna last very long because
they are not able to do that activity
they're gonna produce a ton of lactate
ton of fatigue um and that race is going
to be over so
those are kind of two separate ideas
that they're kind of hybrid into one i
would uh go
and read more about henneman size
principle and that will probably make a
lot more sense to you this one's kind of
like a hybrid of a couple different
principles
[Music]
excellent answer james james i'm gonna
let you take this next one i'll read it
and then please answer it and i might
have some things to add in
my book says that critical power and
lactate threshold are similar and
related but don't go into more detail
um can you explain why they are
different concepts they seem like the
same thing to me critical power is
apparently the maximum pace
that can be maintained purely by the
oxygen system that theoretically can be
maintained
definitely however realistically can
only be maintained for 30 minutes or so
why can it be maintained for only 30
minutes
yeah that's a good question so the
lactate threshold is essentially the
point at which
um the lactate that you are producing in
the muscles is no longer
being able to be buffered at the same
rate that it's being produced and you
will start accumulating
lactate within the muscle and possibly
into
other areas of circulation critical
power is kind of like um
kind of a proxy for like a vo2 max kind
of level pace this doesn't mean the same
thing as hitting a vo2 max because vo2
max is more of like a peak but it's kind
of like
what's the highest rate that you could
theoretically sustain
purely through oxidation right um those
two are going to be really
highly related simply because like as
you increase intensity
lactate production also just goes up
hand in hand but they do kind of diverge
off at a point so the lactate threshold
is basically saying like
all right as the intensity is going up i
can buffer my lactate i can buffer my
lactate i can buffer my lactate and you
hit a point where the intensity is high
enough where it's like
i'm at equilibrium with my lactate and
if you keep going past that point
now i'm actually going to be
accumulating lactate and at that point
you're on a fatigue
related time bomb you will not be able
to continue
doing what you are currently doing at
some point you either have to slow down
or that event will end as a result of
fatigue uh critical power and this is
not something that
is i think this is kind of like an old
time a little timier term
but critical power basically be like the
max race pace that you could push
the thing is yes there is no such thing
as um yeah so there is no such thing as
being able to purely sustain energy
output by one energy system or another
they're all used at the same time
um the thing with oxidation is it
doesn't produce energy
at a fast enough rate to be able to
sustain exercise indefinitely that's the
problem so whenever you start exercise
you're going to be
kind of very phosphogenic initially and
it's going to move into glycolytic
and then as exercise continues it'll
become increasingly aerobic if the
intensity is relatively low
the problem with the oxidative system is
that it doesn't even reach its peak
rates of
energy output until you're roughly 90 to
120 minutes
into an exercise session so you have
been accumulating
metabolic byproducts and fatigue that
entire time you might even be tipping
over that lactate threshold at some
point just because of the duration
and the intensity of the activity so
it's um it's kind of a fool's errand to
think that you can sustain
activity just purely through oxidation
because just the
just to get to that point where you're
at your peak output you've already
committed to quite a bit of fatigue and
you've
probably already at least flirted with
that lactate threshold time bomb at some
point
so remember all energy systems are
operating at all times
the volume and intensity and the
duration of the activity will shift
their relative contributions around
but they do not work uh exclusively
without each other
great answer james i just want to add
that um critical power
says you defined it as the maximum
basically maintained purely by oxidative
system
that's not correct critical critical
power of the axis data system that would
be correct but kruger power in general
is just the the amount of power
uh that you have to put out in order to
sustain an effort of x duration at x
pace
like 30 minutes at 10 miles an hour your
average power has to be this and if your
power falls below that you're just not
doing it anymore
you're not going to hit your pace so it
comes in handy on cycling
where if you're on a bicycle you
actually have a power meter and you know
what power you're at
and that power if you've done the
calculations correctly will get you
where you need to go
at whatever duration you have uh you
know set out so if i
want to get this next mile marker in 30
minutes that means my wattage can't fall
below this critical power right and if
it's falling below like i'm fucked right
so that's really what critical power is
and as james explained lactate threshold
is when your lactate goes from stable to
uh
exponentially accumulating and and that
also depends on variety of things
there's not one lactate threshold it
really does depend on a variety of
activities
and also a lot of times like you could
have lactate here you could lactate here
lactate here and then lactate thresholds
when it finally shoots up like this
uh a lot of times you know people say
anything below lactate threshold is
sustainable and definitely
bullshit because eventually you sustain
the same thing galactic goes
towards the end it's just how long it
takes until lactate threshold goes on is
the real question
um and then number three
how can you use the concepts of either
lactate pressure or critical power to
improve duration of anaerobic glycolysis
uh anaerobic glycolysis is interesting
one how is this type of training
structured
uh in other words how does this relate
to being able to do very high intensity
activity for a longer period of time
uh the situations i can think of as
applying as some sort of sports i mean
the wrestling shoulder intense cross for
workouts yeah it's actually a very easy
answer here and james can clean up or
correct me if i'm wrong but essentially
um
uh various forms of interval training
are excellent for doing this
because so what you really want is to be
around
the best way to get a better life
threshold and let's improve your ability
to do
uh or actually impersonability aerobic
glycolysis uh not anaerobic glycolysis
uh is to make sure that you're sort of
in that flirting with that zone
close to the threshold close to that
lactate threshold probably the best way
to do this
is to operate at a low baseline level or
at no level at all and just sit there
and then exceed get to and then past the
lactate threshold
try to hang in as long as possible when
you get too fatigued to hang in drop off
and either stop doing the activity
like in crossfit sets of 10 in the squad
or like an endurance running you just
run slower for a while
and then once your lactate begins to
clear and stabilize then you bump into
it again
it's that flirting with the zone that
gives you a lot of time exposed to
all of those lactate uh sort of
inclinations
and thus your mechanisms for clearing
and producing
all elevate and adaptations go and then
eventually that entire bar
of around your electric threshold goes
up and up and up over the months of
training
and all of a sudden your fucking baller
who can you know uh
do a ton of aerobic like house aerobic
glycolysis anaerobic glycolysis
how you improve that is actually very
straightforward you just the lactate
threshold is here
you train up here all the time train up
here a bunch and then relax straight up
here a bunch and then relax
because that's where the anaerobic
glycolysis is happening right here and
then close to the threshold
it's actually a lot of aerobic
glycolysis because the glycolytic system
doesn't outpace the
oxidative much so you can keep up uh so
lactate threshold training and stuff
like that really is
uh mostly pushing your aerobic abilities
anaerobic glycolysis is just like you
know like you're literally just training
that when you're doing sets of 10 on the
squat no joke like that
that's how that shit works that's i'm
glad you said that because that i was
going to segue into that so a lot of
people just assume that that means like
you have to do this like very high
intensity
type cardio training and really so those
terms are kind of uh have been
replaced over the last few decades so
kind of in the
era that mike and i were studying really
what you're talking about is developing
what was traditionally been called
strength endurance which is basically
your ability to tolerate high intensity
exercise and what we just call that now
is much more simple we just call work
capacity right which means can you
tolerate
voluminous and or high intensity
exercise and have it not
kill you right so that's the idea and
really
starting off with doing you know like
incrementally harder and harder uh
moderate intensity exercise
weight training is a great example of
that it's it's high intensity compared
to like
walking or jogging per se but something
like weight training is a really good
way of building up your tolerance to
both particularly anaerobic exercise but
also aerobic exercise to some degree
and then having a combination of
something like some weight training
and then some kind of form of cardio
training whether it's aerobically based
or more anaerobically based is really
how you get good at that kind of stuff
and if you're using a face potentiated
model
you would have a period where you have a
few mesos or months
where you're doing kind of more
hypertrophy type lifting we'll say like
kind of in that like
you know sets of 10 type range and then
you build up that work capacity so your
muscles and connective tissues are
tolerant to that exercise stimulus and
you're not going to break down
and then later you would increase the
intensity and get into whatever high
intensity activities like crossfit
as you move into your sport specific
training later on after you've developed
that tolerance to training so
they go hand in hand they don't have to
be one or the other it's one of those
kind of like face potentiated things
where if you want
high intensity endurance for those kind
of things you build it first with
moderate intensity and kind of ramp up
over time
simple as that excellent answer which
brings me to my final point on this
hopefully
a huge pet peeve that it has been for
years energy systems training
what the fuck does that mean all
trainings use your energy systems
and which one by the way in which
combination holy
fuck it's like it's like it's like
saying like oh today we're going to be
lifting that's muscle training
fuck off what like yeah virtually
training makes sense it's an actual
outcome
but like every training is muscle
training use your muscles for every
fucking training fuck
yeah so like the energy systems training
is is a way of
of trying to and dr mike knows this i'm
not talking down to him at all but like
just to just to
just to go on his point so they use that
term energy systems training and they
make it
sound complicated right where the
reality is it's like it's not really
energy systems for training
you're really just working on the
kinetics and kinematics of whatever
training that you're doing like how long
does an effort last what's the average
intensity of the effort what's like a
work to rest ratio of the sport or
activity that you're doing
that's what you want to know it's not
like what percentage of the energy is
being produced by
the phosphagen system versus anaerobic
versus like that
that's how they package it but that's
really not what you need to know what
you need to know is like what is the
athlete doing
how long do they do it for how much
recovery time do they have when do they
repeat
that kind of stuff like metabolic
training like yeah it's like
it's all metabolic folks it's all
metabolic was i not metabolic
metabolism is off shit all right
next up is john palacio he says
hey docs number one if scientists think
the process of
synthesizing new muscle isn't a quick
process it could happen over months i
know there's still a lot of unknown
about timelines
would say getting a night of low quality
sleep significantly reduce
any muscle gain from that day's training
stimulus it might
because remember stimulus and resultant
growth are two different things
right so like if it takes a year
to build a sculpture for a famous
third world leader okay or a greek
leader
it takes a year to construct the
sculpture but you take one gunshot and
quickly kill the messenger that's
getting the draft of the sculpture to
the designers
you had an alteration that took fraction
of a second
and it canned a whole year of work from
ever
happening so the stimulus that puts into
motion the growth that occurs for weeks
and weeks and weeks
can actually be a very small short of
time frame
it can affect muscle growth way way down
the line now
to put that in perspective i think you
do have a good point there that you're
implying one night if this sleep
is just not gonna make a big difference
in your overall muscle growth and that
would be the case
even if muscle growth occurred on a on a
daily time scale level or an hourly time
skill level after all
you have so many hours in the year if
five of them were of shitty sleep when
they normally ate would have been of
good sleep it just really doesn't amount
to much so either way it doesn't amount
to much but we've got to be careful
between the difference between stimulus
and the realization of the process yeah
i totally agree with dr mike there and
this is
there is something there you know i i i
only can support this with anecdote uh
but if you've ever
had like a really fucking good training
session where you're like i know
tomorrow i'm gonna be jacked up
but for whatever reason you don't get a
very good night sleep
uh maybe you stayed up or you just
couldn't fall asleep you wake up the
next day feeling not jacked up at all
and you're like man i thought for sure
sometimes
you get sore yeah exactly and then all
of a sudden
the next night you get a good night of
sleep and then you get that like super
delayed onset
soreness and you're like holy shit there
it is there's definitely something there
that's worth noting again that's
anecdote but um there's also some other
cool stuff um on the kind of motor
learning side where we know that
a lot of uh motor learning is kind of
hit or miss
depending on whether or not you get
sleep now the muscle is going to respond
differently but there is a nervous
system component where
if you're trying to learn motor skills
and your sleep gets disrupted
a lot of what you were learning that day
is definitely
inhibited you do not get the same
carryover effect of motor learning uh
in some in many cases when sleep is
interrupted like that so
i'm not saying that the nervous system
and the muscle operate in that same way
but it does kind of paint this picture
that like yeah even missing an acute bod
of sleep could have tangible effects on
your training
um number two for my reps that's on
small muscle groups where some volume is
getting higher like six plus working
sets would it make sense to break them
into clusters of meyer upsets
um okay something like
ace so it's already directed
uh yeah i was like wait i thought maybe
is that what you said
maybe it'd get rid of the first meyer up
and say for sets of small muscle groups
where the sun volume is getting high
would it make sense to break them into
clusters of maya upsets
oh no clusters matter so something like
eight sets of calves maybe do four sets
with five seconds rest between stop take
a proper longer rest and repeat is there
a better strategy
i think yeah yeah i think it's whatever
um it gives you the highest stimulus to
fatigue ratio
so if you've done some eye reps just to
save time and then like after four or
five mile rupture like i really need to
just
cool it for a sec because my systemic
fatigue and even local fatigue is
getting out of hand
and you rest an extra 30 40 seconds and
you hit another cluster i think that's
totally fine so as needed to keep your
stimulus fatigue ratio high and if
that's something you think benefits you
i think that's totally good to go you
could even do smaller clusters of like
two major upsets rest for a longer time
two my reps that's less for a longer
time
just make sure you're judging you know
how hard the contractions are my muscle
connection
and your degree of pump that you get out
of this and also long-term gains
like if you get gnarly fucking crazy
foreign pumps and just a ton of mind
muscle connection
uh tons of tension perception so on and
so forth tons of lactate accumulation
doing a straight maya rep but if you
stop and restart it's not as good
then don't do that but if you stop and
restart and get an even better result
then absolutely do that because you
don't want to just be doing junk volume
towards the end of the month
i just did a wrist curl junk volume and
it looks a lot like something else
although it doesn't really because
people sometimes people say like this is
jerking off like you move your dick
front to back what the fuck are you
doing like you really you're
yeah i agree with dr mike here the only
thing i would say is um you probably
want
it's it's a slippery slope when you
allow yourself to break
protocol just because just because
so what i always say is you might want
to find
the play with your myo rep protocol and
try and implement it consistently
whether it's taking a slightly longer
break or you say okay after four sets i
take a
a larger break than normal just to kind
of get back into it
that's fine but it's it gets a little
wishy-washy when you start saying like
well i'm doing mile reps but i'm only
doing mile reps when i feel like doing
my wraps and now i'm doing something
else
i you could if you look at um like
metabolite training is a really good
example of this
where let's say you're doing push-ups or
something like deficit push-ups for
higher reps
and let's say you take 30 seconds of
rest and then your reps just go
like within three sets you're down to
doing like sets of five at that point
and you know you're like okay i'm not
really getting much going on here
but if i take you know 50 to 60 seconds
rest
you can at least have your reps stay
elevated you get good mind muscle good
pumps good burning and you can get you
know like
20 15 12 10 8 rather than like 20
8 five five something like that um so i
think the consistence finding the right
protocol and just implementing it
consistently is probably better than
just
uh i just don't want you to get
wishy-washy is really my point
that's a great point james would you
want to answer number three there as
well
um so number three is
fuck let me pull it up uh would you
consider my reps an intensity technique
based safe for metabolic muscles because
i feel like it's very related to your
last point
yeah that that to me i am not someone
who has used
uh mile reps in my opinion really
successfully i've dabbled and i've used
them in different ways and i've played
around with it and i've done it with my
clients
and honestly i haven't figured out a way
to do it that doesn't really fit
in kind of that metabolite meso style
it's not that doesn't mean that i'm
right or wrong
it's just from a practical standpoint
that seems to make the most
sense in terms of its implementation
other people do it a different way
um but i think my opinion
the sfr of doing that when you're kind
of in you're you're more of like your
standard like six to ten
kind of rep stuff just doesn't seem to
make sense whereas like implementing it
like on a meso three where you have a
little metabolite dab
uh dabble here or there seems to make a
lot of sense and it seems to be easy to
implement
very good answer number four form
training the following exercises were
notably absent from a hypertrophy
guide wrist extensions reverse curls
hammer curls this is intentional for
example i've seen mike
have i've never seen my mic do any
forearm work other than wrist flexion
so the wrist extensors uh for me are so
small
they're such a small muscle group it's
kind of like the um
the foot extensors like the tibialis
anterior i don't know
anyone saying that trains the tibialis
interior um
and i think that for various rowing and
stuff like that the
rustic sensors yeah the rustic sensors
get trained plenty they get trained a
ton of lateral raises of every kind if
you think about that
um if you wanted to use them great i
just don't think like
there's it's as likely that we'll
publish those uh
those exercises as we would like
tibialis your exercises james do you
have anything to
say on that i like some of those
movements uh but i'm not
it's again it's like an sfr issue like i
actually feel like i get a lot out of
reverse curls i get
massive pumps my forearms aren't
necessarily limiting
um and like it'll fuck me up the next
day most people
say like i get nothing out of reverse
curls they're completely useless
exercises for me
right it's just a difference in sfr
across individuals
hammer curls are one that i like to use
a lot but i've had plenty of clients who
say hey those hammer curls are really
fucking up my elbows can we do something
else and
certainly we will um but i don't yeah i
don't really have any other
insight other than mostly just kind of
sfr at that point like they might work
for you and if you don't really care
about like things like your wrist
extensors like then you don't have to
train them
super super very good point um
why do you think seated calf raises are
necessary
notable absence exercise from the
catholic virtually guide i understood
because i know both
more or less view them as a waste of
time but the average reader might wonder
why they aren't mentioned they aren't
mentioned because they
don't train the gastrocnemius which is
the biggest most athletically pleasing
part of your calf they train the soleus
which is actually more slower twitch
and the gastrocnemius and soleus are
both trained in
a straight knee extension whereas only
the soleus is really trained
in bent knee extension or bent knee
plantar flexion
so it's just a dog should exercise with
a poor sfr for muscle almost no one sees
that doesn't even grow that well that
you could also hit with another exercise
holy fuck it's starting to add up
if you want to do them that's totally
cool it's just nothing we're gonna
recommend
uh to most people because it's just not
what they're looking for
you don't like what i want my calves to
look like i want it to look like i have
like a mcdonald's hash brown
sitting on top of a pancake that's why i
do my seated
my seated uh calf raises exactly i want
the soleus to be bigger than the
gastronomy so people can laugh at me
exactly number
six last one from john lesic he says
uh when adding sets to given session
with two to three exercises for a body
part let's say a session with rose
five to ten lap pull ten uh ten to
twenty is it best to virtually a
virtually either the first exercise
earlier the mezzo and more to the second
lighter more isolation exercises later
than meso how do you think about the
choice each week we already answered
that we covered that earlier
um and who the fuck asked that question
it was
number one part of his question uh john
if you want to scroll back to that that
is
going to give you the answer you'd like
so there you go basically the short
answer is
sfr best sfr uh for added sites
adam there all right erez erez
sweet fucking name is there any way to
increase my cardiovascular enduro slash
approach if your workouts without
fundamentally hurting growth yes
because cardio exercises increase core
solves to my knowledge also they convert
your fiber types
and you end up becoming more slow twitch
which means sweet work capacity but
less hypertrophy i want to be able to do
higher rep leg workouts but right now i
feel like my cardiovascular system is
limiting factor not my target muscles
thank you from keep up the great work so
i have um
a couple points one improve your
recovery get more sleep eat better food
and it'll make you better
able to execute uh high volume workouts
with high work capacity high reps
a second to lose fat if you lose fat you
get better at all that shit you'd be
surprised as to how much body fat
impedes it when i'm leaner
i don't even have a work capacity limit
like i could just keep going when i'm
fatter
uh jeez i just you sort of peter out all
of a sudden
and lastly do workouts like those
and eventually you get better at them
and also you get hypertrophy from them
so it's like a very very
exact use of those specifically
principal james
yeah really really good answer and that
that really is the bottom line it's like
how do i increase my work capacity for
hypertrophy training
you do hypertrophy training really
that's really blip and especially if
you're trying to say it in such a way
like you phrased it like
how do i do it in such a way that
doesn't uh inhibit growth well it's like
well that that really is the only option
at that point outside of the points like
losing weight like dr mike already said
because any training that's not
hypertrophy training as we said earlier
in the webinar
it's just an opportunity cost it doesn't
matter if it was cardio or
you know power training or jump training
whatever um anything that you do
at that point is an opportunity cost
lost and it will impede it to some
degree but it turns out just doing
hypertrophy workouts is a great way to
get conditioned for hypertrophy workouts
go figure
specificity
yo go figure fuck off
that you know what that just made me
think of i got tagged um i think his
name's jace jumps on instagram that jump
guy from rp plus i think he's in his
like final peaking phase
for his like dunk thing so he tagged me
in something today it looked pretty cool
very cool all right here we go time to
screen share for the three youtube
questions
folks we got about two more webinars
where we're gonna go three in youtube
and then we switch to ten youtube
questions upvoted
uh ranked by votes and here we go
let's do it
so what do we got here we got let's take
a look at mike's
recommendations we got a bunch of time
of soul no surprise uh john meadows
stuff about islam oh american enterprise
institute that makes sense
and yeah yeah really winnowing it down a
whole lot less greg ducette
uh i think it realized i never click on
his links uh and that just stopped
recommending it to me all right i just
kept hearing you talk about it
in okay
here we go diane uh di mona b
great question what is your opinion on
chrono nutrition
is keeping larger more carb dense meals
earlier in the day worth it in terms of
optimizing body composition considering
the calories and macros are checked off
with protein evenly spread throughout
the day
would it be worth avoiding eating closer
to bedtime my personal answer
is that the research on this is so far
not convincing enough
for me uh to say absolutely yes but i
say it's curious and i would keep my
mind
i would keep my eyes on it the good
thing about eating less carbohydrates
and probably fats in the evening is been
pretty well demonstrated i think
with potential small upsides the bad
thing about it is if you're on a cut
you have to eat a little bit more
towards the end of the day in order to
fall asleep properly and sleep eats
every fucking thing
so i think especially for massing i
would not eat as much towards the end of
the day as i would in the beginning
and cutting you might end up having to
shift that a little bit but for now
the research is just not there in terms
of volume and when it is there i'll tell
you this coronal nutrition is going to
be a very very small effect it could be
a significant effect that's worth your
time
but it's not going to be life and death
james
yeah i've only looked at this a little
bit so what one thing's confusing for me
is
is it like a macro specific thing or is
it just calorie loading at certain times
specific thing both it's like mostly
keeping your carbs earlier in the day
and not eating it's so keeping your
carbs earlier in the day
and then also reducing calories at least
in the meal before you go to sleep
should be like a relatively low fat
uh higher higher protein lower carb
and thus lower calorie meal yeah so
there's some like really obvious
situations where that falls apart like
somebody who needs
more food to get sound or sleep somebody
who trains in the evening those are like
really obvious answers but
keep your eyes peeled it's one of those
things where like we just don't have
enough information to really say yes or
no
so just i'd say table it for now don't
don't throw it away just table it for
now come back to it when there's more
info yeah great question from
farhan
red and russian that sounds almost like
a really nasty swear word
uh all right uh
so how long does it take for strength
mesos to lose their effectiveness if
someone has a lot of muscle mass
for doing bodybuilding style training
doesn't that automatically mean he can
do strength work for a longer period of
time effectively than someone who really
isn't less heavily muscled well
so if you if you're really only
dedicated to pure strength and you're
not using anabolics to increase your
muscle mass on the background
i think that given some level of
muscularity without a lot of familiarity
with strength training
and given that it's pure strength
training in the sense that it doesn't
increase your muscle mass at all
i think you can go up to as long as a
year maybe a little longer in some cases
optimizing neural coordination and other
structural factors in order to increase
significantly your strength level
and then very small increases after that
um
and to answer your question of if
someone has a lot of muscle mass moving
in bodybuilding style training and let's
say assume he's very unfamiliar with
strength training
doesn't that he mean he can do strength
work for a longer period of time
effectively if someone has a someone who
isn't very heavily muscled
absolutely and i'll say there's a
confounding variable there with people
who aren't heavily muscled if they do
strength training they gain muscle from
it because usually not having a muscle
means always trained
right but if you have a guy who's
trained for a long time in strength and
isn't very jacked versus a guy
who is very jacked from training five
percent for a long time but hasn't
trained for strength at all
you take that second guy and he could
train for years you know only strength
training get better and better better
perfect example is amit's appear meets
up here was an iphone bodybuilder
and he changed his training focus to
powerlifting
and he actually lost muscle the entire
time that he was powerlifting got
fucking exponentially stronger broke the
squat world record a bunch of times
um because he was just getting so much
better at the movement so much stronger
from the neural perspective
um and because he had a fuck down of
muscle like any time a bodybuilder
is healthy and has no injuries and is
genetically very strong hasn't strength
trained in a while and enters the realm
of power lifting the only thing people
say is like
if he doesn't get hurt he's gonna fuck
shit up he's gonna keep getting stronger
forever a lot of times people
can be bodybuilders not training for
strength and have these crazy gym
numbers right dude if that guy fucking
did
a strength cycle it would go insane and
as long as they don't get hurt that's
always true
whereas if someone's like already kind
of like a twig and they've been training
for strength for years they're doing
tons of sets of three to five
and they're like hey i'm gonna do a
peaking cycle and straight cycle i'm
just gonna get tons stronger like where
fuck's that strength gonna come from bro
you've been training for strength for
years
at some point you need to go back and
put on some muscle
yeah excellent answer and then just to
kind of go back to that first part a
little bit how long does it take for
strength mesos to lose their
effectiveness the answer is the same as
uh hypertrophy mesos or anything else
right effect essentially it's a volume
landmarks problem where
your mev uh and your mrv get too close
together and then you just can't train
for strength anymore it's the same it's
the exact same problem just slightly
different context so
when you get to that point where you you
are the amount of training you need to
get stronger
exceeds what you can tolerate uh that's
when it stops being effective and that
doesn't mean that you can't strength
train longitudinally it just means you
got to take a break from strength mesos
and do something else for a little while
last question and i see it's also it's
already ranking them basically ranks
them for us here based on uh
popularity of upvotes so this is really
good milo wolff is
killing it milo is the fucking man um
look at that 33.
he gets paid good money to do that god
damn it uh people are going to be really
pissed they're going to be like what is
you always read milo's time stamps
that's the count
great question milo so finally we just
read that and we're like
you got them all correct it's bullshit
they only answer nine questions one's
just the time stamps
amazing all right ben fleming 1000 not
to be confused with prior version ben
fleming
999 who was retired and summarily
executed
and the future of ben fleming's 1001
who was going to be a revolution in
fleminghood what about ben fleming prime
my brain is going to explode we're not
here to talk about top race
top secret research projects exactly
all right in the lecture video on
prioritizing muscle groups and this is
what i did for youtube recently you
spoke about working the prioritized
muscle first in a session before
anything else
how do you balance the isolation
exercises with the compounds for example
if i wanted to target hamstrings and
quads
would be better to start with rdls and
squats or hamstring curls and leg
extensions
assuming we were only able to train
three or four times a week so no two
dice two
a days or do you just try it and see how
it feels well you have a question
to answer before you pick that you want
to answer the question of
do you want more raw stimulus magnitude
or do you want a higher stimulus to
fatigue ratio
raw stimulus magnitude almost always you
start with compounds uh
because they just fucking just break
shit more and make you more jacked but
at a price of high fatigue
if you're running into fatigue problems
and you want a stimulus to fatigue ratio
that's higher sometimes it pays
to start with isolation pre-fatigue the
muscle that's targeted and then do the
compounds after not always but sometimes
so once you answer that question then
your answer there is obvious but
generally speaking you want to put the
most effective exercises however you
define it first
so if if stiff like i wouldn't like make
this isolation and compound distinction
and james and i have been getting
further and further away from that we
just really worry about rusting this
magnitude and sfr
like if an exercise is fucking good it
doesn't fucking matter if it's compound
or isolation because it fucking works so
if hypertrophy is your
your goal then you just gotta do what
works and whatever works best you
probably do best
so if you told us that like uh stifling
and outlets don't do a whole lot for you
which we would
do the skeptical james eyebrow are you
really doing them correctly but let's
say you were right
and you said like girls lying like girls
were just trashing you and they were
awesome
what should you do first of course
fucking lying leg curls we would never
tell you in a million years that that's
stupid but generally speaking uh it
comes down to whether or not it's
rusting this magnitude versus the
fatigue ratio of james
yeah and i was as you were saying that i
just had kind of a thought running
through my mind
that's the i think that's the the
biggest difference between kind of
bodybuilding and traditional sports
where traditional sports tend to favor
the raw stimulus magnitude side of
things where you just need to get
fucking strong
fast powerful and there's a pretty
straightforward way to get there
whereas bodybuilding is a little bit
more nuanced a little bit more
flexibility and and the bigger priority
then is sfr right how do i get
the biggest stimulus with the least cost
so that i can you know
basically have the lowest number of sets
to reach my mrv for any given activity
like that's the idea
there um and i think sometimes those two
things get confused a lot because the
traditional sports model is yeah okay
i want to be good at basketball uh well
how do you get good at basketball well
you make them fucking strong and
powerful how do i do that well you do
the
compound movements generally you
prioritize the compound movements over
the isolation movements and that's where
a lot of i think that confusion lies so
as you were saying it's that that
thought was running through my mind and
i was like yeah that makes so much more
sense because
in strength sports we say do the
compounds just because it's got that raw
stimulus and it doesn't
the sfr is great and if you can find uh
a movement with the big raw stimulus and
a high sfr that's probably great for
sports but for bodybuilding it's much
more forgiving
boom how's are good james
james if i could give out golden stamps
to just being an awesome guy you will
never get one
oh you set me up got you i set you up so
good i underhand pissed you
i thought you were gonna go like willy
wonka that i thought you were going that
route i was thinking like he's going to
do golden ticket willy wonka
like pervy willy wonka or like forrest
gump willy wonka
[Laughter]
that fact that that distinction exists
as one of the beautiful artists or
live i i got a good good one for you to
work on
uh harvey wonkenstein
ah my head
hey hey what you want the golden ticket
do you want to come back here and uh
give me the yeah you want the chocolate
i've got the factory
on that note we should wrap this one up
folks uh
a couple of notes real quick before we
go we're gonna uh uh we made
announcement last week we're just going
to reiterate that real quick
um for all of the rp plus questions that
have been answered up through today
mike and i are still going to backlog
those and answer all of those questions
but today was essentially the cut-off
day which
at the time of the recording is june 7th
so all questions up to excuse me july
7th
will be answered and then from that
point on we're going to switch to
youtube only so
and we'll make more announcements as we
go but just be prepared we're going to
start using the youtube system so you
can post your questions there
or if you see questions that you think
are interesting please upload them and
then we're going to take the top 10
excluding milo of course
unless he has a real question yeah
really and we're not even going to
on principle we want to answer his
questions
all right folks we're out have a good
week peace
