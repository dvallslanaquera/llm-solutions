[Applause]
yo what up Eugene
[Music]
what's up YouTube
clearly I'm still Dr Mike that doesn't
change unfortunately
and here we are with the man the myth
Legend
the heir to the throne of the Atlantis
Fortune
please talk us through where are we why
is there so much noise am I going to get
my arm chopped off yeah she's gonna be
all right we're gonna tour the factory a
dentist this is where we make all of our
equipment everything's made here we cut
the metal we paint we assemble uh we're
gonna get uh you guys around it and uh
yeah maybe you'll get to uh some of them
do an interesting things as well
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I think the secret is in the details how
we make it the dimensions and everything
that's why it feels so great as well
when you do it here we got like we're
working on a project the small one uh
adjustable Jammer arms for some sports
team because the one the children can
have is not adjustable so it's too
restrictive sure so this is an
attachment that goes on spot racks that
looks really hardcore yeah we're trying
stuff we're trying to figure out the
adjustments that could support like 10
000 pounds or something yeah
everything's very Overkill yeah usually
but that's the point these are all jobs
waiting to be welded these are all the
tubes for this is one Mission sure sure
this this uh machine what it does is it
cut the tubes and we also uh do these
slots yeah so it'll reduce uh you need
to measure everything together
yeah so this is the laser cutter for two
machines uh we've got the the laser
there and the jaw what happens is the
jaw will will grip the tube and will
control everything moving forward and
the head stays there and just does all
the cut when it's done just rolls out
right in front of us and we put it in
the right place okay
so you're French Canadian yeah which
means sort of French yeah when the laser
is on do you ever light a cigarette with
the laser like
actually
[Applause]
you're gonna make yourself a homemade
machine with all these parts yes that's
the idea what's that this is a polishing
a tube uh machine that comes from uh
Portugal
so whenever we have like tube that needs
to be polished like stainless steel it
gives them a nice finish and the powder
coat sticks better to it as well yeah
yeah not a good idea yeah I wouldn't do
it depends which one you're putting on
but yeah I need to polish my nails I
think I consider Atlantis like the role
the Rolls-Royce of bodybuilding
equipment yeah we're not the mainstream
ones we don't want to be uh we all about
performance and you know it's not the
majority you are about performance yeah
well if you're if you're somebody who
trains super seriously and you need the
machines Force curves to just feel
completely right that's what Atlantis is
for as far as I can tell when I talked
about Atlantis and everything I use it's
just so smooth how is it so smooth I
don't know what you motherfuckers put in
there it's magic Quebec sauce but it oh
this is where Raymond's major touch he
tries everything we do a small
adjustments we we're not like producing
elsewhere and designing somewhere else
right everything's done here so yeah the
communication back and forth is very
short so we can adjust everything very
quickly yes like you can try stuff right
in the factory always oh that's great
this is the paint shop
it's quite archaic
but it works well it works well it's
very simple so we use the rack to move
them around and uh we put our layers of
metal on the floor so the racks were not
shaking too much
they're drying off from being painted or
uh yeah they're pulling down actually
but they're probably they're already
cold but we usually usually uh give them
a few like 15-20 minutes to cool down
but this is a challenge as well for the
manufacturing you cannot fast produce
anything online like every part is
different size uh different colors so
you cannot like develop specific tools
for every part so we have to adapt this
way
the uh
this machine Cuts everything with the
everything that is a sheet
we're expecting another machine that
will go behind this one that will do all
the bending automated bending for us
part of it is done by hand here and the
other part is outsourced but you want
more control sure so these order is
waiting to be shipped out I will show
you a few uh products that are going to
be released within the next two months
okay that you will also be able to try
at the gym oh so this is the new
pendulum pro version oh fuck why do I
have that stupid personal one God damn
platforms adjustable you have band tags
on both sides to decide if you want the
strength curve to be
kind of wider down form is all these
machines going to make people jacked all
over the world
beautiful thank you so much for the tour
this has been incredible and now uh
we're gonna go see the gym yeah let's
have lunch and work out perfect
[Music]
clearly I'm still Dr Mike this is
Raymond saususi
yeah I did that okay yeah he is the
owner and founder the originator the man
all the time and behind Atlantis
gym equipment and we are here at
Atlantis gym in Montreal Canada or close
enough anyway
uh and we are going to get a gym tour
and you will notice that every single
piece but one is Atlantis can you guys
imagine so if you ever in the Montreal
area traveling passing through get you a
day pass to this gym first of all it's
an amazing gym second of all it's all
Atlantis equivalent It's the Best
Equipment you'll ever use
what do you think tour time we'll make a
door let's do it I'll show you let's do
it
[Music]
there's some machine right now they're
not on the market uh but soon they're
going to be in the market so it's like
prototypes prototypes yeah I can't say
we try it usually we try it uh one month
something like this two months to see
the winter also and the way it feels yes
because sometimes in the factory you
cannot feel 100 so when you put it in
the gym you know you you are an Ambience
also and you can try it feel it you know
and sometimes so that's why I like to
sometimes tweak it a little bit yes
here the machine for the hamstring this
is a cool machine yeah but I tweak a
little bit I don't know if it's going to
be good or not I gotta try it let's see
I'm gonna put some weights
for record yourself
you see
I had it I've invented this machine in
my head before and I wondered
it's pretty good too oh yeah but you
know what try this you know
sometimes you know when you you do two
movements and one machine it's kind of
tricky but uh this one why not you know
so that's why I tried it it's not on the
market right now this machine I found
out that for the lower abs
because people when they do
leg raise on this yes sometimes your
shoulder stuff but here you you don't
have any pressure on your shoulder
because you put your feet here
oh so it works yeah that's so cool yeah
this is very good for this whole thing
to move
the trick is you have to push with your
buttocks yes at the back here
and you're gonna feel it you know
what I did lately
that's one person
say I don't like it because it can go
like this we put we put here a latch so
what I like to do with this is to bring
my dumbbells very close
and when they fell down like this just
push
and you do your movement
whatever you wanna
do it like this or whatever
and when you finish you just drop it
like this
that's solid for the regular bench press
same thing you push
[Music]
if you're not able to put it back let's
see
hey
that's awesome don't room your floors
right flooring
[Music]
[Applause]
so I started the gym
in 1980
just like this with my brother and I
tried the machine back then I was not
happy with the movement sometimes I said
so one of my friends told me
I can teach you how to weld and how to
work and I start up with a very very uh
easy machine it was a power rack yeah
yeah a good start yeah and after that
abdominal machine after that the
preacher curl
for myself and I was studying you know
people using it on Saturday night the
gym closed at five so I was welding
directly in the gym
with a small weld machine grinding stuff
like that on Saturday night
I started like this I have fun yeah yeah
and uh since then after that I had some
employees I make it bigger bigger
can I try in French yeah yeah
you're not allowed to actually box each
other in here yeah
I told you I speak French baby
you're good hey thank you so much huge
honor you're welcome huge privilege
thank you for your contribution whenever
you can come back you know come back
because I know that you're not gonna
have the time to try everything no I'll
be back many times just push today yeah
I'll be back for more stuff oh yeah
thank you so much for everything this is
phenomenal what's a pleasure
foreign
[Music]
I'm training on a fine piece of Atlantis
equipment in Atlantis gym
nothing touches his body except for
Atlantis
really neat to see the process and kind
of the vision
behind the company
a lot of companies manufacture equipment
and that's cool
some of them even do a very good job
but what's Happening Here is Raymond the
founder was a bodybuilder first and then
he built his own equipment by hand
welding it
let me try to
and then we started the Atlantis brand
and Company
I don't think he ever made a single
machine
that he didn't want to use for himself
and he never just made a machine
and that side up this is it sell it
perfect
all the machines that they make
they make prototypes first
sometimes they put him in this gym for
real users to use
sometimes they keep them just for
Raymond and
his associates to use
in the factory
and what ends up happening is they move
the welds they move the pivots they move
everything they tweak it they move the
handles they add handles
and that iterative evolutionary process
allows them to manufacture machines
that feel better
and do better work better than any
machine that you would just engineer
caught off the line and go and so it's
that combination of obsession and
passion for bodybuilding that he had the
ability to make his own machines the
ability to take his own feedback and the
feedback of others and he actually told
me numerous times like if you use our
machine you think it could be better
just let me know how and
that iterative process over and over
that Loop makes things better and makes
the machines
I don't even want to say more user
friendly it just makes them better at
everything
more muscle growth stimulative feeling
better better stimulus to fatigue ratio
more comfortable
the worst
and I think that's something we can take
in
to our own lives and no matter what you
do out there
in the real world
you can take your passion for what you
have
create something you think is worthwhile
and then see how that process works test
it get feedback test get feedback test
get feedback modify the process or the
product
until it fits into the groove really
really well
one thing Raymond told me before we
parted ways but he said
he doesn't think a single machine in his
own gym that he made
is as good as it could be this is always
room for improvement
how do you stop someone like that from
being successful that understands
Improvement is an iterative process that
is willing to put in the work and has
the Insight the answer is you really
don't
and so that's why Atlantis makes damn
near the best equipment you can buy
is that process Improvement you can do
that yourself in your own way I try to
do that myself my own way but usually I
just end up
falling back I'm looking in the mirror
and just crying
all the time tears why am I me and not
someone else but you're not me so be
happy about that
and try to use this kind of
evolutionary adaptive process to your
own benefit
that's how good things are made folks
that's what I got thanks for tuning in
we'll see you next time
