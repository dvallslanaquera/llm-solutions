during a training session most people
tend to rest passively between sets
meaning they pretty much do nothing also
for the most part it's quite common to
rest from anywhere between one
to five minutes between sets in a
workout comprising of three sets of
seven different exercises
assuming it takes around 30 seconds to
perform each set
resting two minutes between sets and
exercises would mean that the session
lost around 50 minutes and 30 seconds
however 40 of those minutes would be
spent resting
that's quite a bit of time spent doing
nothing is there anything we could do
during those rest intervals to enhance
muscle growth
well a fairly recent paper by sean phil
and colleagues
aimed to find out if holding isometric
contractions between sets
could enhance muscle hypertrophy 27 men
with at least one year of training
experience were allocated to either a
passive rest group
or an isometric both groups trained
three times per week
for eight weeks the same six exercises
the barbell bench press barbell overhead
press wide grip lat pull down
seated cable row barbell back squat and
leg press
were performed for both groups
three sets to failure with a 8 to 12 rep
max load
were performed for each exercise the
passive rest group rested 2 minutes
between sets
the isometric group also rested two
minutes between the sets
however during the first 30 seconds of
this two minutes
an isometric contraction was performed
during the rest intervals between the
barbell bench press
and barbell overhead press the isometric
group performed an isometric contraction
for the triceps subjects held their arms
by their side
and aimed to extend their elbows as far
as comfortable while squeezing the
triceps maximally
during the rest intervals between the
wide grip lat pull down and cable row
the isometric group performed an
isometric contraction for the elbow
flexors
the elbow flexors by the way comprise
the biceps brachii
brachialis and brachioradialis subjects
held their arms by their side
and aimed to flex their elbows as far as
comfortable while squeezing their elbow
flexors maximally
during the rest intervals between the
barbell back score and leg press
the isometric group performed an
isometric contraction for the quadriceps
subjects were seated and aimed to extend
their knee as far as comfortable
while squeezing the quadriceps maximally
thickness of their elbow flexors
which included the biceps brachii
brachialis triceps brachii
mid thigh which was a composite of the
rectus femoris and vastus intermedius
and lateral thigh which was a composite
of the vastus lateralis and vastus
intermedius again
was measured before and after for both
groups
confidence intervals were used to
represent the results with the values on
the y
axis equaling the gains experienced by
the isometric group
minus the gains experienced by the
passive rest group
for the elbow flexors triceps brachii
and lateral thigh growth was similar
between the two groups
however for the mid thigh growth
slightly favored the isometric group
interestingly there was an individual in
the passive rest group who experienced
substantial growth of this muscle
while there was another individual in
the isometric group who experienced
little growth of this muscle removing
their data shifted this confidence
interval
such that all the values of the interval
supported the idea that the isometric
group
experienced greater growth of the mid
thigh compared to the passive rest group
so the results of this study suggest
that holding isometric contractions
between sets
does not enhance hypertrophy of the
elbow flexors triceps
or lateral thigh but it could
potentially enhance mid thigh growth
these are intriguing findings could
anything explain why the mid thigh
benefited from isometric contractions
well exercise selection can likely
explain this
both the passive rest group and
isometric group were training the
barbell back squat and leg press
the rectus femoris which is part of the
mid thigh
is poorly trained with these movements
indeed
research by kubo and colleagues
demonstrated that back squats at 140
degrees of knee flexion
and back squats at 90 degrees of knee
flexion failed to grow the rectus
femoris
leg extensions on the other hand have
been documented to be quite good at
growing the rectus femoris
given the isometric group were
essentially performing an isometric
leg extension between their sets of the
back squat and leg press
this will likely increase tension on the
rectus femoris resulting in greater
mid-thigh growth
i think two equally valid
interpretations can be taken away from
this study
given their elbow flexors triceps and
lateral thigh
were all stimulated to a fairly good
degree with the exercises used by both
groups
and experienced no additional benefit to
performing isometric contractions
between sets
it could be speculated that if both
groups were performing a leg extension
the use of the isometric leg extension
between sets would likely not be
beneficial too
however for those pressed with time and
cannot or do not wish to perform leg
extensions
as we've seen from the study the use of
an isometric leg extension between sets
of squats or leg presses
can effectively be used to grow the mid
thigh
