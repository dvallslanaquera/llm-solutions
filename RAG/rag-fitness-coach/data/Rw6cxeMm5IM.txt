hi guys my mower Charlotte for an
advanced periodization and today I'm
going to do a super simple recipe for
egg white wraps and this was in my big
flavor zero fat cookbook my most recent
one and this is again something that I
had done at home and posted it online
and you guys were like oh my gosh how
did you do that so I want to show you
today how easy it is this is just liquid
egg whites in here I'm just gonna season
it with some salt and pepper and
then this is some fresh chopped mint I
absolutely love mint in my eggs if
you've never tried it before
you gotta try it there's something about
the combination had it once and I've
just never made eggs at home without
mint again so just mix all that in
and there's a technique to this get a
really good nonstick pan heat it up over
medium heat pour in a thin layer
of egg whites
just a thin layer
swirl it around if you need to to coat
the pan and then just let it sit and
it'll cook on its own and it'll start to
curl up around the edges you don't need
to like pick up the edges we're not like
making an omelet or anything like that
you're just gonna pour in this thin
layer
and let it do its thing
so I'm gonna start to play with it now
see if I can get it you can see it's
just coming up and like one big piece
there we go it's ready it released all
by itself
I've got a pan here ready with a paper
towel on it to absorb some moisture just
pour it right off let it cool
if you get a little bit of fat
you can make an egg dia like a
quesadilla
put some cheese on here
fold it over
know what that I hang out and milk when
I made them for myself and you guys
showed a lot of interest in it but just
had some saut√©ed veggies I
just filled the center sorry look at
this you could have this your meal one
of the day on your templates is just
protein and veggies you might tell
somebody like oh my god what am I gonna
eat in the morning how I get is protein
and veggies you could have this I mean
that is nothing to complain about in my
book
you
