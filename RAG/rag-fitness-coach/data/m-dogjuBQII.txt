When we think of the size of a muscle, we
often base it on its outer appearance.
However, muscles are 3-dimensional and occupy
space within the body.
Therefore, volume is a much better measurement
of a muscle's true size.
This study explored the volumes of the lower
body muscles.
The gluteus maximus is the largest lower body
muscle by a fair margin.
Interestingly, the adductor magnus, an underappreciated
muscle, is fairly large and comparable in
size to two of the vastus muscles of the quadriceps.
