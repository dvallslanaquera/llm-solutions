hey folks i'm dr mike isratel for
renaissance periodization
this week's weekly tip short little tip
to help you guys train
diet recover so on and so forth is
trying the technique of alternating
supersets alternating supersets to save
time in the gym what the hell are these
and why are we trying them well
if you're in a rush let's say
crazy traffic you got a date with your
pretend girlfriend at 7 30 p.m you're
supposed to come home and shower by
seven so you can make the date at 7 30.
normally you start your workout at you
know 4 30 and have plenty of time this
time crazy traffic and you started your
workout 45 minutes late what that means
you might have like half an hour to work
out or not at all now here's the thing
it might seem like good training is
completely impossible and you're just
like well fucking i just drove the gym
for no goddamn reason turning around
driving home and then i'm gonna shower
and shave and sit down to the date and
your pretend girlfriend's gonna be like
so like what are you up to today and
you're like damn it i didn't get the
train ah you pick up a fork you stab
yourself in the eye she starts yelling
people know what's going on the
restaurant staff is crazy the police
show up you're in a psych ward for the
rest of your life we don't want this to
happen so we have a better idea
you can get much
benefit not all of it in a tiny fraction
of time by just switching the script on
how you do your training
instead of your usual plan you might
want to try what we call alternating
supersets here's what you do you pick
two exercises at a time that are
antagonistic or not overlapping which
means none of the muscles used in one
exercise is heavily or at all used in
the other exercise so that while one
exercise is being performed the other
exercises muscles are resting to get
ready to go again so for example just
examples
squats and incline presses
we don't really use any of the muscles
you do one for the other curls and
lateral raises
pull downs of leg presses these are odd
combos right
and you can do these with any muscles
that don't overlap don't intersect and
here's how you do it you do the first
exercise
let's say it's squat you do squats
usually a higher rep set
close to failure rack
take only 30 seconds of rest
and that includes you racking the weight
walking over to the incline sitting down
looking at your watch or your cell phone
as soon as 30 seconds expires unrack
incline and go
do a high rep set of incline presses
rack 30 seconds of rest hit squats again
and so on and so forth does it have to
be 30 seconds no it can be 15 it can be
45 or even a minute you should be
breathing pretty hard this entire time
but not like
right that's bad but pretty hard
breathing you essentially your breathing
never goes down to normal it's kind of
like you're jogging the entire time at
least that level of breathing intensity
so 30 seconds you hit squats or hit lift
one 30 seconds hit lift two 30 seconds
hit lift one again
so each set is a super set of two
exercises you do four or five sets
basically like four or five times
squatted four or five times inclined 30
seconds break between each of all of
those and that's a crapload of stimulus
to the muscle in minutes we're normally
good god for squats you could take a
long time to warm up this is a lighter
load higher up so you don't have to
worry about that warming up is much less
time consuming
you normally could rest
two three four minutes or even more
between every set of squats and incline
presses because you want the most out of
each set that is ideal
but you don't have time for ideal you
have just time for this so if you're
supposed to do like 15 to 20 sets
total for three or four muscles that
session you could get that done in like
20 minutes i'm not even joking like 20
minutes or something like that you can
blast all of the muscles you had on the
dock
what are the advantages of this okay
your
individual muscles that you're training
let's say biceps on a combination of you
know curls and lateral raises your
biceps don't just get 30 seconds of rest
between sets they get 30 seconds of rest
plus however long the laterals took
which is maybe another 30 seconds to a
minute so they really get a minute and
30 seconds rest now it's not high
quality rest it's not total rest but
it's absolutely better than nothing
which means that if you alternate their
supersets alternate alternative
alternate your performance on them
doesn't fall nearly as much as if you
tried to do that to the same muscle like
if you do a chest press rest 30 seconds
chest press rest 30 seconds chest press
your reps go down like crazy but if you
chest press row chest press row chest
press row your reps go down a little bit
but not nearly as much as you expect
which means you get much more high
quality work to the target muscle this
can allow you to cut the workout
duration from what you were going to do
by like 70 no problem that is huge that
means in our little fantasy scenario we
did before this we show up to the gym
late you can leave the gym on time to go
shower and then go to the date
completely cooked right sorry i misspoke
not completely cooked but damn well
cooked your muscles are feeling it in
addition to that because your breathing
rate never falls below a certain level
it's a great cardio workout too which
means this kind of thing that saves a
ton of time is actually pretty fun and
really challenging and has a great
cardio workout as well as a resistance
training workout is almost ideal for
regular folks
if i ever work i don't work with regular
people anymore i just talk to machines
all day long but if i ever work with
regular people and back when i used to
the average person coming in who's going
to train with me for two or three times
a week we do not stand around talking
between sets we set up two exercises
that are antagonistic or not overlapping
and they fucking go
30 minutes you wish never happened but
it's challenging it's fun you leave
drenched with sweat and it's a really
good hypertrophy stimulus
now the downside is that your individual
muscles don't recover nearly as well as
if you'd actually given them three
minutes of rest i mean for the love of
god while you're doing pull downs
there's no way your quads are going to
cover than if you were just laying down
or sitting down it's not possible
this means that the effectiveness of the
workout even if the same number of sets
occur even if everything is taken in the
same proximity to failure
it's going to fall by maybe as much or
even a little bit more than 25 percent
i mean that sucks but notice we reduced
the time commitment by 70 and the
effectiveness of maybe only falls by
about 25
so if you're a really advanced athlete
and your bottom end kind of a minimum
effect of volume minimum effective
intensity etc is like somewhere up 90 of
what you're normally capable of
if it's up to you to have a good workout
or no workout
and you're in a mass gaining phase it's
not just muscle retention it may be good
to just skip the gym that day and come
back in hard the next day and do a real
good session if you're a power lifter
strong man et cetera and you're going
for limit lift lifts super heavy three
to six
or even one to three reps
there's no way you're gonna be able to
pull this off it's just fucking
impossible so just skip and come back
the next day
but if you want to maintain muscle
and or if you are or you're just working
with folks that just want to be
generally fit and you want to squeeze
your workout in
and if you're a beginner intermediate
these kinds of workouts don't optimally
grow but they're better than nothing
much better than nothing
you're good to go so while it's a little
less effective than what you could have
done if you don't have time to get done
what you could have done
the comparator is not 100 it's actually
zero so if you get 75 of your good
workout with taking up you know a tiny
fraction of the normal time
it
is a really good idea something's better
than nothing at all in many cases
then it's something you could have in
the back of your mind so when you you
know flight delay
or schedule change or if this and that
happens and you still want to hit the
gym but you don't have as much time as
you thought try at least some of these
alternating supersets and you might see
that you get a pretty decent workout
with a tiny fraction of time folks
speaking of time i'll see you next time
for next week's weekly tip video peace
you
