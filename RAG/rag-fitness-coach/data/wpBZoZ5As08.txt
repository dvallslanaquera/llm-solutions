hey folks dr mike isrtel here with
renaissance periodization
today's video is about troubleshooting
your relative effort
are you getting the reps in reserve that
you think you are
why should you care and uh some really
good problems
to be solved so let's just take a look
at
relative effort basics relative effort
in hypertrophy training which is the
goal of this talk
uh is going to be measured usually
with the rir scale rar stands for reps
in reserve it's how many reps you think
you have
until you think you can't do another
high quality rep with good technique or
you'll reach muscular failure
so a couple of sort of basic facts about
rir it's been shown through many many
studies
that you get roughly the same
hypertrophy results at least in the
medium term
from anywhere between three reps in
reserve training to zero reps in reserve
or near failure or failure training
so that's cool what that also means is
like if you grind it
way beyond failure all the time do four
straps that's probably not a huge
benefit if any
could be a cost and we also know that
like if you train much easier than like
three or four reps in reserve all the
time you never push it close to failed
you're probably not training hard enough
to get your best results right
the best programs probably start around
three reps in reserve because it's very
effective
and it's not overly fatiguing and they
usually scale up
in load and repetitions over time until
the end of the program or the end of the
mesocycle has you doing
probably at least two things if it's a
really well designed program for muscle
growth one is
you probably reach like zero reps in
reserve if not outright failure and
many of your lifts and you're at close
to maximum recoverable volume
which means what you just did in that
last week if you tried to repeat it
again
you would either barely be able to
repeat it hitting no more prs just tying
pr's
or your strength would actually be down
doing that
can give you a guarantee of that you're
between three reps in reserve
and zero reps the entire time which
means you're in that uh
really excellent zone of maximum
hypertrophy progress by adding
load and reps every week you account for
the fact that your body's adapting and
by pushing up and up and up you test the
limits of what you may think
your failure point is but like at some
point if you can't make any more prs you
know
pushing ahead is well impossible and
thus it's okay for you to deload recycle
repeat because clearly fatigue is pretty
high
and if you hit your maximum recoverable
volume which again is when you can no
longer exceed your performance
then you also know you're not under
dosing volume or something like that
you're not just lifting super hard for
so
few sets that it's causing barely any
hypertrophy if you do enough training
and you make it harder over time you're
hitting all the boxes that make sure
you're growing muscle really well
if you want more insight on this we have
tons of other videos about this
just go to our youtube search for rer
our rp renaissance periodization rar
relative effort my last name in rar all
that stuff comes up and you can learn
for hours and hours and hours
if you're not familiar and then come
back to this video because this is a
video that assumes
you know the basics of rir and now it's
time to address the fact
that you can have some problems with
reps and reserve and some of these
problems are
things that people will use as
detractions from the rar method
and they're not very good detractions
because they're all solvable problems
so first problem you can have
is you may suspect
like you're telling yourself okay i
stopped three reps in reserve but you
have a suspicion that it's really not
three percent reserve and it's really
like five
which means that at least that week that
you did three rir before you try to go
harder
is uh maybe a wasted week or mostly a
wasted week like maybe it was really
five or six reps in reserve
and that means like your efficiency with
how much muscle you're growing for that
week of training
maybe just isn't that great next problem
is you do your 3rir but you suspect and
i get a lot of these comments and
questions on youtube and instagram
and people say like so i hit 3rir but
like man like in my heart of hearts
i feel like i'm like one rep in reserve
like i know i'm
way pushing it too hard i'm not sure
though that i feel like i'm pushing it
too hard which i think fatigues me
really early in that
ascension of reps and load and just
doesn't allow me to really catch the
groove
and i get really tired within two or
three weeks i have to deload and it
screws everything up
very legitimate concern because remember
that whole spectrum between three and
zero rer is effective
and if you're saying you're starting
here and you're using off that whole
spectrum
but you're really starting here there's
just not much spectrum there to use and
very quickly you're training super super
hard at the
end of your abilities and you may not be
getting as much lifeline in your
training as possible
next problem is a very common one uh
you estimate zero rar like you
say i didn't have any more reps left but
it might not be
really your zero like in the back of
your head you're like man
yeah i wrote down 0r in my notebook i
don't think i could have done any more
reps but
push come to shove if shit got really
real i could probably do two or three
more reps which really is to say your
rr's two or three
and not really zero so that's another
concern it's tough to know these things
especially
like knowing them right when you're in
that hack squad and contemplating should
i do another rep or not
that's tough right and after the set is
over like ah shit and you could have
misedimated in one way or the other
right lastly a more detailed problem but
a problem folks nonetheless experience
is like you're pretty sure what your 3r
is you know when it's time to quit and
you have maybe three
four maybe two reps left in the tank you
know like roughly that region is not
difficult
it's like when the bar just starts to
slow down you're like all right i'm
gonna can it
but then you're supposed to be in some
training designs hitting these rr
progressions
like this week's rar3 next week's two
next weeks
after that is one and then zero and
because you have those targets
you're like look i know what three rr is
but two zero and one
man they feel the same to me it's all
super fucking hard
and i can't really tell like like
someone was like hey was like what's the
goal this week was that to where i are
and you're like i
guess but it could have been zero and it
could have still been three
i'm not really sure man it could have
been two or one who knows
good news okay bad news these all sound
like pretty legit problems
and when they're leveled as critiques of
the rir tool
some people say man fuck rer just go to
failure all the time
not the worst idea ever really makes
things quite simple but maybe not as
maximally effective as possible
but with all these problems yeah failure
training definitely simplifies things
the good news is these problems are all
solvable so let's get to solving them
so we're not going to go problem by
problem because a lot of these solutions
attack a bunch of the problems at the
same time they just increase the clarity
with which you can know
rir and in some interesting ways
make it that you don't have to know your
rar but you still go through that whole
spectrum anyway so
first up you can stop trying to guess
your rirs
really meticulously week to week to week
and tailoring your training to them
so for example you hit 10 reps last week
at a certain load
this week you may be like crazy
overthinking okay what load do i have to
put on the bar
to hit exactly to where i are how many
reps do i need to do and there's all
these equations in your head
you can obviate a lot of that by just
doing the following
every single week you take the same
exercises and the same sets
you can even increase or decrease sets
to get to your mrv
but what you do is you just have a rule
of adding a little bit every single time
so let's say you did 10 reps with 100
pounds in the bench last week
this week you do 10 reps with 105. next
week you do 10 reps with 110
and then 115 and then 120 and so on and
so forth now you can also increase reps
100 pounds for 10 reps then 11 reps then
12 reps you can even do a little bit of
both
right the thing is if you're consistent
in that load and rep scheme increase
what this does is it guarantees one
thing for sure
you keep going up like that you will
eventually hit failure you have to
unless you're like benching a thousand
pounds for sets of 25 and you're like i
still haven't hit failure then great you
have superpowers you have a whole other
laundry list of issues and problems and
rars not your problem anymore in the
real world
you will absolutely hit failure then
once you hit failure
you'll be able to count back all the
weeks and be like okay week one i did
rer what i thought was three
week six i did what i thought was zero
and you can interpolate all the other
rr's roughly
and get a real good sense of where you
are right and
that's really quite helpful now what can
end up happening
is some unlikely things can happen if
your first rar target was actually
correct
let's say you hit your first 3r and then
you follow the algorithm of just
increasing load and reps a little bit
each week
and then nine weeks later you
finally hit you know your mrv
and you look back at how strong you were
when you hit your mrv here
to like a few months before this
mesocycle and you're a little bit
stronger but not like nothing crazy like
let's say you put
10 pounds total onto your bent row for
the same reps as
two or three months ago so you look back
all the way nine weeks and you're like
okay if this really is my bent romance
like first out of ten right here and if
it's only up a little bit
for what it was before the cycle i said
i started three reps in reserve
how the fuck did i make it all the way
through nine weeks of accumulation
if every time it was getting harder
where the fuck how's it possible that i
gained so much strength but really it
didn't because i'm not that much
stronger
that really narrows down the options to
one thing whatever the fuck you thought
your three rr was
wasn't okay it was like six or nine or
something completely insane
so if your progression is way too smooth
and way too easy
and you fail way too late in the process
not too late but like it takes you a
long time to hit true failure
yeah you there's a good chance you
underestimated your rir
and you're probably like were not nearly
as far or not nearly as close to failure
as you thought you were at the time next
mesocycle next program
you can be a little bit more aggressive
in pushing yourself on the other hand it
could work in reverse as well
you do a week and you're like 3r for
sure bro you do two weeks and then you
hit your failure point and you can't add
any more reps or load and you actually
start to get weaker
well man i don't know two weeks unless
you did some crazy shit and add like 15
pounds each time or three reps each time
yeah you're probably not at three reps
in reserve that first week you might
have been at like one or two and you
might have suspected it too you're like
man was that really three i felt like i
was pushing a little too hard
and then two weeks later you're
overreached like okay that was
definitely not three
i definitely pushed a little bit too
hard then you know for next time
if you try to just raw guess your rri
every time and the reps and sets change
or sorry the reps and load change all
the time
it gets real tough to see what's going
on and it gets real tough to make sure
that you're actually making training
harder over
time what is the best way to make sure
you're getting from three rr to zero
is slowly go up up up up up up up and
you have to get to zero r eventually
must unless you get infinitely strong
next one is you want to keep track of
your rep strength
in each week and mesocyclomesa cycle
that way you can guess the first week
rar because there's this big mystery
week number one i'm doing some different
rep ranges some different exercises a
lot of the stuff is still the same
i just did a deload what load and reps
do i start at to hit three rir or so
look if you have three rar roughly and
zero rar
two one etc data from two mesocycles
before that
like it's not that tough like someone
could say like let's say your last
rer you bet rode 135 for a zero rar set
of
uh 10 like that was no more was possible
just 135 for 10 that was your best
performance
at peak this time someone's like all
right
what do you think we're going to be
doing bent rows for sets of 10
what do you think's your three ri are
like 140 you'll be like hold on
fuck up i did 135 and blew my load on it
one deal a week's not magical how the
fuck am i supposed to do
you know if i do 145 for a set of 10 at
3 rir
that means i'm capable of doing 13 reps
at 145 whereas i just did 135 for 10
like uh i don't know man that seems like
a bit extreme i don't think i gained
you know that many reps and that much
load in strength over just one week of
dealering unless it was completely
crushed or something insane
i think you know what like let's i think
i gained some strength since last mezzo
and i look back on my other numbers 135
for 10. i think a real reasonable 3rir
is gonna be like 125 for 10. you do it
and it's beautiful and it's because it's
based on data
right that's it right and if you do
enough of those cycles
you can figure out a load and rep
progression
that's likely to progress your rr on
track here's what i mean let's say one
mesocycle you're like all right leg
press
i'm going to add 15 pounds of shit every
week you started at a pretty correct
3rir two weeks later 30 pounds later
you're at zero hour and you're like fuck
i'm trying to train for like four five
or six weeks at a time before a deload
not two
because clearly like every 15 pounds
jumps more than one rep in reserve
maybe like a rep and a half or something
we don't want that shit
so then you go back and you go okay okay
i really take it easy
leg press i'm gonna add five pounds
every time so you know like press 400
405 410 415 week by week by week and it
takes you like
eight weeks or even all you deloaded
everything else because like after let's
say five weeks your whole body's wrecked
except your leg presses still haven't
had failure or anywhere remotely like
okay so five pounds just is not enough
to increase
week to week to week to target that rar
to get close to zero by the end
finally you wisen up in this last
mesocycle and you still have leg press
still progressing
it's okay five pounds was not enough of
a challenge to get to zero rr at the end
15 was way too much let's try ten and
all of a sudden you put together four
ball or weeks of training the first
one's pretty tough second one tougher
third one etcetera
and the fifth week right before you
deload just as an example i mean you hit
your maximum recoverable volume
you everything you had zero rar just
barely ties that performance
flawless you literally gave it
everything you could and the way you
figured that out is like what kind of
progressions
made sense or didn't over time if you
never write anything down
if you never make sense of any
progressions your brain usually results
resorts to like cockamamie schemes of
you know all of us are like man
i want to put 20 pounds on my leg press
each week well no fucking shit and so
does everybody else
but you may not have the strength to do
that or the adaptation
rate to do that so you got to pick
something realistic but challenging and
the only way you can do that is looking
back at your old data
right lastly for more of the advanced
folks
you absolutely can modify rep
goals or load prescriptions
within each session even set to set for
example
instead of doing two weeks of
progression and leg press
and then failing on week number three
with that 15 pound example
let's say you did 450 pounds in week one
week two for the first set you're
targeting like whoa it's three hour to
start you're like
week two will be like two or three r
right you do
465 like 15 pounds up and all of a
sudden
like that's a fucking zero rar first set
and you're like
fuck me 465 is not two or three r
it is like fucking zero i barely locked
out the last rep
do you think to yourself like okay i
already know where this is going
and i don't need a third week to tell me
i'm an idiot can i change
course now like the way you steer on the
freeway isn't just by hitting
like the the railing on the side and
then going up too far and you hit the
other railing
like you see the shit coming right 465
for first set now
maybe it was a bad set maybe you want to
try second set really not
up maybe do a second set of 465 and it's
still fucking a grinder and it's still
zero rr you're like all right
i'm not going to be stupid about this
what i'm gonna do right now in this next
set let's say you have three sets total
two sets you pissed away thinking you
were superman you weren't
this next set you're like you know what
fuck this 465 shit
i'm going down to 455 just five pounds
ahead
you hit it and it's the first set all
day that was really two or three rir
like you knew you had some shit in
reserve awesome
here's the big jump next week what are
you gonna do
well you just hit 455 for only
successful set
and progress is is malleable it's not
like you have to do more every single
time you just have to be in that
challenging range
an intelligent approach would be this
455 was great
go to 460 next week not don't try to
repeat 465 again
don't be like i gotta put five more
pounds on go to 470. fuck that you know
what's going to happen there it's just
going to fail
you go to for so you work 455 you go to
460.
okay it's five pounds down from your
peak sets doesn't matter you hit an
excellent two or one rar next week
you're still alive
you hit an excellent one or zero rrr at
465
and then the last week you hit a true 0r
at 470.
fucking super productive mesocycle you
gain a shitload of muscle and you never
shit the bed and you never had to cut it
off and look hey you made a strength pr
or 470 which you would have never
fucking made
because you would have tried you know
480 and just totally ate shit and never
matched your reps because you're already
overreached
right so you can make these adjustments
you can do them in
load like we just described you can do
them in reps you're like oh yeah 12 is a
bit napoleonic let me try sets of like
11
or 10 or something like that why is this
why is this a thing why is this a thing
only for advanced folks
beginners don't need it because they can
usually just eat up their mistakes no
problem because their fatigue management
is like not an issue like they can just
get stronger so fast
if they guess a little wrong it's all
okay in the end but
the main one is it's really easy to
second-guess yourself and really easy
to either get too much bravado if you're
adjusting all the time
like you're like oh man that set felt
great let's put 15 more pounds on like
no no
don't fucking do that just do the sets
normally and then change next week
playing a good conservative game is a
good thing but on the other hand if
you're not advanced then you don't have
experience with rr and you don't have a
good sport psychology mindset
you may play too conservative and you're
like oh that was like i don't know if
that was
really two ir felt like one or zero i'm
just going to take weight off
and it fucks your progress like a lot of
people will come into the gym with all
the best intentions
and then just try a heavy set or even
just warm up and be like no
it's not happening and they go lighter
you keep doing that and you never
sort of reach up and discover what your
body's really capable of so
really points a and b are the meat
potatoes
just get better at progressing and
guessing your rer to begin with
and letting all the slack be taken up
with little improvements don't worry too
much but if you're off
by a lot from your target rr and you're
more advanced you can absolutely on the
fly
auto regulate there right so
that's really how you solve a lot of
these problems
and in the end if you're reasonable
about this you get awesome progress
no big deal and at some point you reach
failure anyway and usually that's number
of weeks later and you've had awesome
progress and it's no worries
right the simplest way
to give the rar recommendation is this
you start with a bit of breathing room
don't push yourself hard at the
beginning of the cycle because it's the
beginning of the cycle
beginning of the cycle means you're
really sensitive to growth you don't
have to do much you don't have to push
hard to get great growth and
not only are you having a good session
now a big part of training is to set
up a better sessions after and after and
after
right so give yourself some breathing
room buy
small amounts increase reps and or load
each week
to make sure that you're pushing your
body into the fire slowly but surely
if you just auto regulate load and rep
increases purely and you're just like oh
when i feel good i go up
man who knows how the fuck you feel i
feel like shit half the time i still get
stronger
and sometimes when i feel great shit
just doesn't happen so go up a little
bit because
look you started roughly through ir you
keep going up when you can't progress
anymore
that's it there's no adjustments to make
take a recovery half week or a full week
of recovery which is a deload
recycle repeat and then you just
basically start a little easy hard hard
hard
can't do it anymore deload start a
little easy hard on heart and that's it
that's the cycle it doesn't have to be
much more complex it can be
but that's not going to give you these
huge gains 90 of your gains come from
this
simple formula that's it now
the big kicker here is if you're nailing
roughly 3rir
very roughly and you're also
meticulously
adding a little bit of reps and load
every time
and then you for sure get to zero or
true failure at the end
if you have those check boxes anything
in between
you just don't have to know the rir that
well
is it two is it two point five is it
three who gives a shit i started at
three
i'm adding shit until i get to the end
that's it
so anything in between doesn't really
matter that much
it's like if you're on a road trip and
your odometer is reading like it's your
friend you know who visiting for the
weekend lives like 500 miles away
and you're 300 miles into the trip right
and you you calls you on a cell phone
because he's super excited he's like hey
what are you getting here and you're
like oh yeah it's some 200 miles away
and he's like oh cool like which town is
around i don't fucking know
in the middle of fucking nowhere in
montana it's fucking dark i'm not
getting out hillbillies will shoot me
i've seen all the movies so like it
doesn't fucking matter i said it's
fucking 300 miles i've already driven
you know 300 that's 200 more
do your own fucking math like as long as
you keep driving on the right path which
gps helps you don't have to check for oh
city no oh my god we're passing this
town okay that's good like you already
fucking knew that it was irrelevant
what's the point here well uh folks will
watch
a bunch of people's training videos
including my own and they'll be like hey
like
what rirr was that like a particular bat
row or or
like a press or something and like is
that three or ir
and my usual answer is like yeah sure
you know i don't know or it was two or
it was one
i don't care because each week i just
add a little bit of load add
up a few reps or a rep here and there
and then at the end of it i
always go super close to failure so i'm
always pushing the limits i'm always
starting conservatively
i learn month to month and week to week
how to juggle that process to make sure
it's pretty accurate
and what happens between here is just a
linear ascension i don't give a shit
neither should you i guess the point is
video is stop giving a shit i'm just
kidding
be intelligent start a little easy
proactively increase load and reps in a
sustainable way that can get you
four to six weeks at least of ascension
make sure you push yourself hard enough
to go very close to failure or a failure
at the end deload recycle repeat that's
it you're going to be a half door julius
