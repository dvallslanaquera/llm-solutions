a brand new study out of japan by mayo
and colleagues has recently come out
comparing overhead extensions to push
downs and its findings have important
implications for maxing triceps
hypertrophy let's dive into this great
new paper
[Music]
21 untrained adults comprising 14 men
and 7 women had one arm assigned to an
overhead condition and their other arm
assigned to a push down condition
both arms were trained across two
sessions per week for 12 straight weeks
the overhead condition arm-trained
overhead cable extensions
while the push-down condition
arm-trained cable push downs
both exercises were performed from zero
to 90 degrees of elbow flexion and with
a supinated grip
every session
the subjects alternated which condition
was trained first and both of the
exercises were trained for five sets of
ten repetitions with two minutes of rest
between sets
training loads were gradually increased
at the first second and third sessions
from 50 to 60 to 70 percent of warner at
max with a 70 percent warner max load
used thereafter
when a subject could not complete 10
reps on a set a researcher spotted and
assisted them to ensure the attainment
of 10 reps per set
once a subject could complete 5 sets of
ten reps on one of their exercises
completely unassisted training loads
were increased by five percent next
session
before and after the study the
researchers measured the volume of the
whole triceps as well as the volume of
the long triceps head
as the researchers had trouble
differentiating between the lower part
of the lateral and medial head
they opted to measure combined lateral
and medial head volume
it was found that whole triceps volume
increases were 1.4 volts greater for the
overhead versus push down condition
long head triceps volume increases to a
1.5 fold greater for the overhead versus
push down condition and combined medial
and lateral head volume increases were
1.4 volts greater for the overhead
versus push down condition
thus
overhead extensions grew the triceps
notably more than push downs
this isn't the only paper comparing
overhead extensions to push downs one
other paper out of greece similarly
found overhead extensions tended to grow
the long head at 50 and 60 of the upper
arm region more than push downs
no other triceps regions were assessed
unfortunately
now this finding ended up not being
classed as statistically significant and
is likely related to the sample size of
nine individuals plus the study only
lasted six weeks
yet it's important to understand
statistical insignificance doesn't
necessarily mean no difference
[Music]
as we know the triceps consist of the
long medial and lateral head
the medial and lateral heads only pass
over their elbow joint and thus are
called single joint muscles
the long head passes over both the elbow
and shoulder joints and thus is called a
two joint muscle
due to this structural point the long
head is stretched when placed overhead
and this likely explains one of the
findings of the mayo study
that long head hypertrophy is
significantly enhanced with overhead
extensions versus push downs
there's a growing body of research
demonstrating achieving a stretch during
an exercise is powerful for evoking
muscle hypertrophy
a previous study by the same researchers
mayo and colleagues evaluated the
hamstrings
except for the biceps for more a short
head which is a one joint muscle that
only crosses over the knee all the other
heads of the hamstrings are too jointed
as they cross the knee and hip joints
due to this structural point seated
curls are going to stretch all of the
two joint hamstring muscles more than
lying leg curls
and guess what the researchers found
hypertrophy of all the two joint
hamstring muscles were much greater with
seated versus lying leg curl training
while biceps for more short head
hypertrophy were similar between both
exercises
research examining isometric training
finds that training at a stretched
muscle length produces notably more
hypertrophy than training at shortened
muscle lengths
the range of motion literature tells us
the same story partial range of motions
that train the muscle in a shortened
position produce less hypertrophy versus
fuller ranges of motions that achieve a
stretch of a muscle
matter of fact a 2021 study out of
brazil by pedrosa and colleagues
actually found that partial range of
motion leg extensions training the quads
in a stretched position produced overall
more hypertrophy versus a full range of
motion
though
more research is needed to examine
comparisons between stretched partial
range of motion training and full range
of motion training
nevertheless it's crystal clear that
science demonstrates that stretch is
powerful for muscle hypertrophy
returning back to the mayo triceps
findings it unexpectedly also found
overhead extensions evoked greater
collective medial and lateral head
growth versus push downs
we know the medial and lateral heads are
single joint and so are not stretched
any more during overhead extensions than
push downs so what explains this finding
two speculations were provided in the
paper firstly the researchers simulated
models and found that during overhead
extensions the long head operates on the
descending limb of the force length
curve
for those who have no clue what this
means it's simply saying the long head
may not be able to produce much active
contractile force during overhead
extensions
perhaps resulting in the nervous system
evoking stronger force contributions
from the lateral and medial head
thus maybe this explains why the lateral
and medial head also grew more with
overhead extensions
the second speculation was that overhead
extensions
due to the overhead arm positioning
would restrict blood flow to the muscle
more than push downs
this would likely result in overhead
extensions producing greater metabolic
stress the build-up of metabolites
something that's proposed to potentially
drive hypertrophy however a limitation
with this speculation is there are many
cases where more metabolic stress isn't
associated with more hypertrophy thus
the role of metabolic stress in
hypertrophy is questionable and not
super clear currently
based on the data we've overviewed it's
likely some kind of overhead extension
in your training is needed to max
triceps hypertrophy
for those who care more about efficiency
you do not wish to do much exercise
variation and or training volume
and you're not overly concerned about
meticulously maxing triceps gains
overhead extensions alone can probably
do this job
yet for those wanting to do the utmost
to develop the triceps i'm skeptical
overhead extensions alone would be
sufficient
you see
the male study examined volume of the
overall triceps the long head and the
combined lateral and medial heads
volume is a great muscle growth
measurement as it's three-dimensional
and incorporates all regions however
volume does not consider regional
hypertrophy differences
regional hypertrophy is the phenomenon
where muscles do not grow evenly across
its regions and numerous studies
validate its existence
different triceps exercises could
preferentially develop different regions
of the triceps
meaning a combination of a few triceps
exercises are needed to max overall
regional gains
in fact we have research alluding to
this
a study out of japan by kawakami and
colleagues found after training dumbbell
overhead extensions for 16 weeks
the overall triceps mainly developed in
the slightly upper regions
a different study out of japan by
wakahara and colleagues found after
training dumbbell skull crushers for 12
weeks the overall triceps mainly
developed in the middle regions
thus the combination of overhead
extensions with skull crushers is a good
idea to regionally develop the triceps
furthermore it's possible push downs
themselves target slightly different
triceps regions compared to overhead
extensions and skull crushers
so the inclusion of push sounds too
might be beneficial but more research is
needed to validate this
[Music]
stretch is powerful for muscle
hypertrophy and the greatest stretch of
the long head with overhead extensions
versus push downs is a strong candidate
to explain the greater long-head
hypertrophy attained with overhead
extensions
fascinatingly the medial and lateral
heads also collectively grew more with
overhead extensions for mechanisms that
are currently unknown
ultimately overhead extensions are
likely a must for maxing triceps
development
for those who purely care about
efficiency
simply training only overhead extensions
will certainly deliver great gains
for those more meticulous you probably
want to add at least some kind of skull
crusher with overhead extensions as
evidence indicates these exercises may
target slightly different regions
it's possible push downs also target
different regions but we don't have any
concrete data demonstrating this so it's
your call if you want to add pushdowns
into
