after being in gyms for over 20 years
now i'm pretty much at the point of
supporting life imprisonment for people
who do this
people who
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com in this video
today we're going to be going over
20 things people commonly do in the gym
things that you yourself might be doing
right now during your own workouts
but that are ultimately mistakes you
should avoid and this is going to be a
mixed bag that includes
certain exercises that you'll most
likely be best off
to steer clear of exercises that are
effective but that people very commonly
do wrong
and i'm even going to throw in a few gym
etiquette mistakes here as well
so i've got 20 points to cover here let
me know down below in the comments which
ones
you think are the very worst or if
there's anything else that you would add
to this list
if you're new here then make sure to hit

let's jump into it alright mistake
number one on the list one that
might ruffle some feathers right off the
bat because it's a really popular
exercise
and that is front raises now it's not
that front raises are gonna hurt you
but in the majority of cases they're
just unnecessary because most lifters
already get more than enough front delt
stimulation
through all of their basic chest and
shoulder pressing exercises
and their front delts are already over
developed in comparison to the side and
rear heads
which are a lot more important for
achieving that round sort of
capped shoulder look so if you insist on
doing front raises
then that's ultimately up to you but
aside from a very small percentage of
cases
you're probably just wasting your time
and effort overall number two
is a bosu ball squat or pretty much a
bosu ball
anything whether it's standing on a bosu
ball and doing curls or overhead presses
or
using it for chest presses or push-ups
or whatever else okay this doesn't
improve the functionality of the
exercise
it doesn't increase muscle stimulation
or really do anything useful at all for
that matter all it really does is put
you in a less
stable position and reduces the amount
of force that you can generate against
the weight so forget the bosu ball you
don't need it just perform your
exercises on a solid
steady surface number three is reverse
grip triceps extensions
using a reverse grip has no beneficial
effect on the activation of your triceps
it doesn't hit the triceps any
differently or in some special unique
way
and there's really just no advantage to
it however there is a disadvantage
which is that it puts your grip into a
weaker position and makes the exercise
more awkward to perform
if you want to maximize the stress on
your triceps there's no reason
to not use a standard neutral or
pronated grip and you can just use the
grip that feels most comfortable for you
number four is flaring your elbows out
during chest pressing exercises
when you flare your elbows directly out
to your sides at 90 degrees or
even worse you position your elbows
behind your body you're going to be
putting a lot of stress on your shoulder
joints that can definitely add up over
time so instead
make sure to tuck your elbows in
slightly at roughly a 75 degree angle
number five is using excessive spotter
assistance during your sets
so i see this all the time in the gym
where someone loads up way more weight
that they can handle
and then their spotter has their hands
on the bar and is pretty much helping
them out on every single rep of the
exercise
now this makes absolutely no sense at
all to do if your spotter has to assist
you right from the get-go
then the weight is just too heavy and
you need to lighten it up and use a
weight that you can handle on your own
through a full range of motion
not only do you look like a complete
goofball when you train this way but it
also increases your chances for injury
and it prevents you from accurately
tracking progressive overload because
you can't specifically measure
how much weight you're lifting versus
how much the spotter is lifting so aside
from the odd time here and there
where a spotter might assist you on the
last rep of an exercise you should be
doing all of the reps on your own number
six is the cable squat so this is an
exercise that women tend to gravitate
towards
um and i pretty commonly see it being
shown in a lot of these instagram booty
workouts and
youtube glute building tutorials and i
see it being done in the gym all the
time as well
the problem with this exercise is that
the line of resistance is pulling in the
wrong direction
and it's actually putting very minimal
tension on your quads and glutes
because it's basically just pulling your
body forward towards the machine
if you actually want to train your quads
using a cable machine
then you need to be standing right up
close to the machine so that the
resistance is pulling in the right
direction
but that said cables are generally just
not the best tool for quad training
overall
and there are just much better exercises
to choose from number seven a gym
etiquette mistake
and that is lifting it directly in front
of the dumbbell rack
when you stand right in front of the
dumbbells doing your curls or your
shoulder raises or whatever else
you're blocking other people from
getting in and then they have to stand
there waiting for you to finish before
they can get to the dumbbells so
very simply grab the dumbbells you need
take a couple steps back
and leave enough room for people to get
in and out of the rack if you're
enjoying this video so far don't forget
to hit that like button below to let me
know i really appreciate the support
and number eight is standing dumbbell
external rotations
so a lot of people use this as a
shoulder warm-up i even see more
experienced lifters doing this too
and personal trainers you know training
their clients using this exercise
but this movement really makes no sense
at all because if you want to stimulate
the rotator cuff
then the resistance needs to be pulling
from the side whereas with dumbbells the
gravity is pulling straight down
toward the floor and so you're basically
just isometrically contracting your
biceps and your front delts
now external rotations are a great
warm-up movement but to actually warm up
your shoulders with this
you need to use a cable or a resistance
band or you can do it with dumbbells but
you need to be lying on your side
number nine is the behind the neck pull
down so not only does this exercise put
your shoulders into an awkward
excessively externally rotated position
but there's really no advantage to it
either in comparison
to a standard pull down to your upper
chest now i'm not saying that you're
guaranteed to get hurt doing this
but there's just no good reason to do
lat pull-downs this way in the first
place
it's riskier but with no real reward
number 10
is plate exercises which is another
common trend that you'll find on
instagram these days
because hey there's only so many barbell
and dumbbell exercises that you can show
to your audience
so might as well get creative purely for
the sake of being creative even if
there's no inherent advantage to the
exercise
which in this case there isn't plates
are just more awkward to grip
they make it harder to apply progressive
overload it's great for clicks and views
from
beginning lifters who don't know better
because of the novelty factor but
ultimately there's really no point to
this
all right number 11 is performing leg
presses with your hands on your knees
this is another bizarre lifting
technique that i see in the gym all the
time
if you have to press with your hands on
your knees in order to lift the weight
then the weight is just too heavy in the
first place or maybe the weight
isn't too heavy and you're just making
the exercise easier for yourself
and reducing its effectiveness not to
mention that for proper leg pressing
form
you want to be holding on to the handles
so that your lower back stays firmly
planted in the seat
with your hands on your knees your lower
back is going to be a lot more likely to
roll backward and that's going to
increase your chances for injury
you know you'd never do dumbbell curls
and then use your opposite arm to help
out on every single rep
and so there's no reason to do leg
presses that way either number 12
is combo exercises whether it's a squat
into a lateral raise
or a lunge into an overhead press or a
row into a biceps curl so these
movements might look cool for instagram
and they might seem innovative and
unique on the surface but there's
really just no good reason to do your
exercises in this way and that's because
your strength is going to differ
depending on the movement pattern that
you're performing and sometimes very
significantly if you're combining
compounds and isolations together and so
using the same weight for two different
movements like this
really makes no sense since one of those
movements is going to end up being under
trained relative to
the other so instead just do one
movement use the appropriate resistance
that you can handle for that specific
movement
and then do the next movement separately
and use the appropriate resistance that
you can handle for
that one alternating back and forth
between different movement patterns and
the same exercise
there's really no point to that okay
number 13 another gym etiquette mistake
and that is super setting between
multiple pieces of gym equipment at the
same time
now if the gym is quiet and you know
you're using machines that don't get a
lot of traffic then it's probably not a
big deal but
otherwise don't be the guy who loads up
the leg press
drapes his towel over the seat and then
walks to the other side of the gym
to claim some other piece of equipment
or even multiple pieces of equipment
then super sets back and forth between
all of them there's no real advantage to
super sets in the first place
other than potentially as a time saver
and it's just really bad etiquette if
you're forcing someone else
to wait for you to complete your
sequence of three sets of three
different exercises before they can get
to the equipment that you're using
number 14 is excessively heavy lateral
raises
so lateral raises are a great exercise
to target the side delts but they do put
the shoulder into a more vulnerable
position overall
and so you want to stick with more
moderate weight for slightly higher reps
on these now you might be fine for the
short term
but it will eventually catch up grabbing
onto a pair of heavy dumbbells and
heaving them around using a ton of
momentum is a very bad idea okay you
don't need to be doing 50 pound lateral
raises
to effectively stimulate shoulder gains
so focus on technique and control with
these
i would never go less than about eight
reps per set in perfect form
and more like 10 to 12 reps per set and
higher that's probably going to be ideal
most of the time number 15 is dumbbell
triceps kickbacks now if you really like
this exercise i'm not saying you can't
do it
it does work your triceps to a certain
extent but i think there are just much
better options overall
dumbbell kickbacks have an awkward
resistance curve where at the bottom
they're really easy and there's almost
no tension at all on the triceps and
then as you kick the weight back
it all of a sudden becomes a lot harder
so it's easiest in the position
where your triceps are the strongest and
then it's hardest in the position where
your triceps are the weakest
if you're going to do kickbacks then i
would suggest using cables
because that's going to allow for a much
more natural resistance curve and you'll
just find that it feels
smoother and more natural overall number
16 is upright rows
using an excessive range of motion so
pulling the weight all the way up to
your neck with your elbows up toward
your ears
so if you're gonna do upright rows at
all in most cases the weight should
ideally be pulled
no higher than to the point where your
elbows are in line with your shoulders
and you should be using moderate weight
for slightly higher reps otherwise
you're really running the risk
for injury since full range of motion
upright rows for most people
put their shoulders into an awkward
internally rotated position and
using really heavy weights just adds to
the stress now some people out there can
do
full range of motion upright rows with
no problem but for the majority
it's probably something you're going to
be best off to avoid number 17 is the
rolling dumbbell shrug now this doesn't
seem to be as common in gyms as it used
to be
but it's where someone performs a shrug
and then rolls their shoulders in a
circular motion either backward or
forward
now ultimately there's no point to this
because the resistance is pulling down
in a straight line
and so the only way to actually work
your traps is by moving your shoulders
straight up and down
rolling your shoulders around just isn't
adding anything to the exercise
all right number 18 gym etiquette again
the one that drives me
the most insane by far and that's people
who don't
re-rack their weights after being in
gyms for over 20 years now i'm pretty
much at the point of supporting life
imprisonment for people who do this
people who blatantly load up barbells or
dumbbells or whatever else
perform their sets and then just walk
away leaving the weights for somebody
else to clean up now i understand that
the laws of physics are
highly complex and not yet fully
understood but from
a probability standpoint weight plates
generally don't spontaneously re-rack
themselves without human intervention
so there is no excuse here don't be that
guy if you were capable of loading up
the bar
then you're capable of unloading it as
well re-racking your weights is basic
common courtesy number 19 is the
standing plate press now this exercise
might
really feel like it's hitting your chest
hard but that's only because of the fact
that you're forcefully squeezing your
hands together
you can get the same effect by sitting
there with no weight at all and doing
the same thing
in reality the standing plate press
doesn't work your chest effectively
because the resistance is pulling in the
wrong direction it needs to be pulling
back toward your body but instead it's
pulling straight down toward the floor
meaning that it's basically just an
isometric contraction for the front
delts
if you really want to do plate presses
then they need to be done lying down
but standard free weight presses are
definitely going to be superior either
way
and finally number 20 is side bends
using a weight in
both hands now i'm not really a fan of
side bends in the first place because i
think they're just
much better exercises to train your
obliques if that's an area that you want
to train in the first place
for example cable wood choppers or
twisting rope crunches those are going
to be much better exercises in my view
but side bends are especially bad if
you're holding a weight in both hands
because the weight on one side acts as a
counterbalance to the other and so
you're not really getting much of a
training effect at all you're basically
just
aimlessly moving your body from side to
side and more or less completely wasting
your time so those are the 20 mistakes
