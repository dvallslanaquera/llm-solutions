welcome back to another video in this
contest prep series in today's video
i'll be discussing four different things
first i'll discuss how to incorporate
lower and higher calorie days during a
cut or contest prep
then i'll discuss how to track weigh-ins
and make that adjustments
third i'll discuss
how i've planned my photo shoots and my
mock peak weeks and why
and finally
as soon as this police corp stops
i'll discuss my plans for the upcoming
offseason
so first up how do you incorporate lower
slash higher calorie days during cut or
contest prep
in general the data on refeed days diet
breaks etc seems to follow the following
pattern
either
having refeeds and diet breaks doesn't
really hamper diet progress overall
compared to having
a consistent deficit
to match for diet length so for example
let's say you're comparing
having
a
700 calorie deficit daily
to having
five days of uh
essentially a thousand calorie deficit
and two days at maintenance per week
and looking at how that impacts muscle
mass retention hunger etc etc
as a whole
the literature suggests that having
those refeed days or higher calorie days
and lower calorie days
with diet
length matched
it seems to be either the same for
outcomes like muscle mass retention and
hunger and stuff like that or slightly
better for the groups performing diet
breaks or refeed days
and so
provided you can accommodate for it
because
realistically
switching calorie intake's day to day
does increase the complexity and burden
on the client or athlete a little bit
compared to just having the same
food intake every day
if you can afford to do it on a
practicality level
then i think having a refeed days or
diet breaks incorporated
is likely at least not going to harm you
and might provide a slight benefit now
the benefits you see in studies aren't
super consistently replicated
and they sort of vary between studies
but at the very least i don't think it's
going to harm you and it might be worth
trying out if you can afford to do it in
terms of practicality or complexity
in my case the way i'm going to
incorporate them and have incorporated
them in the past at the beginning of
this contest prep
was on training days i have more
calories
and on non-training days i have fewer
calories
now when it comes to how many fewer
calories you want to have
i think for those lower calorie days for
me that's non-trading days
it's essentially as low as i can get
away with
while not being
detrimentally hungry
so in my case that's around 20 to 2400
calories a day
those calories come almost entirely from
pretty
satiating sources so stuff like
vegetables lower calorie density carbs
fruits
lean meats dairy and so forth
and
by having a bigger deficit on those days
again police car i don't know what's
going on
um by having a their deficit on those
days
it allows me to have more calories on
trading these which at least
in theory would then enhance performance
for those training days lead to better
stimulus on those training days which
would overall then lead to more muscle
mass retention across the whole diet
at the very least i find having
higher and lower calorie days to be
somewhat useful in
breaking the monotony of a consistent
deficit
and also
typically i find
on training days i am a bit hungrier
even though i'm busier i'm also a bit
hungrier and so i find it useful to have
a bit more calories on those days even
if only because
having more carbs and training days
makes training a bit more fun as far as
you don't feel like a hungry hungry
skeleton and don't get a pump at all it
feels a bit more um
engaging and fun and you get a nicer
pump
so that's how i incorporate my
lower and higher calories they're
essentially just a modified refeed
so i have five higher calorie days where
i have around 3 300 calories per day
and then i have two lower calorie days
on saturday and sunday where i don't
train currently
where i have around
400 calories let's see
which averages out to probably around
like
3 000 calories per day
which is a lot but when you consider
that i am
around 95 kilograms well 94 right now
which is around uh 210 pounds i think
when you consider my body weight and you
consider that i'm doing
at least 15 000 steps a day
it sort of adds up
but i do feel a bit fortunate compared
to other competitors i've seen talk
about their diet or carry intakes
where they discuss having intakes as low
as 1700 and
that is quite literally half of what i
was having
during most of my prep so far so
yeah that's how i'm incorporating my
lower and higher calorie days during a
qantas prep
and specifically the calories come from
the additional calories come from
carbs on those days
so on trading days i'm having around
900 calories more from carbs only so for
me that's brown rice and cereal right
now but it switches from stuff like
white rice to
sweet potatoes it depends on how hungry
i am the diet phase etc but those
additional calories come from carbs and
they help with
maximizing performance maximizing
recovery from training and thus
enhancing muscle mass retention
across the whole contest prep
now that that's out of the way i wanted
to discuss how to track weigh-ins and
make diet adjustments
so to get
it out of the way quickly
tracking weigh-in should be pretty easy
um
ideally if nothing else is happening
weighing yourself every day is a good
idea and then taking averages of those
wayne's
the last seven wins ideally or you could
even do more but i think seven is a good
start
um i think taking averages of the last
seven weigh-ins is useful because that
reduces
how much a single data point
impacts your decision making let's say
you were only
weighing yourself on sundays
the water weight fluctuation from say
saturday evening's dinner
can then have a pretty large impact on
sunday's weigh-in
and then
if you only base your decision-making
for example on whether or not to lower
calories on that one weigh-in
you can easily make the wrong decision
whereas if you take more frequent
weigh-ins say for example one every day
in the morning under the same conditions
the impact of a couple of slip-ups per
week for example let's say one day you
have a bit more salt or a bit less salt
or you have a higher
weight of food because you have less
calorie dense food or vice versa all
that stuff sort of washes out a little
bit and it allows you to make a much
better and more informed decision
regarding whether to increase or
decrease calories now for diet
adjustments
typically i would make that adjustments
once a week
on
it doesn't matter what day as long as
you make it on the same day every week
in my case i do diet adjustments on
sunday for the upcoming week starting
monday
with my clients as with myself
and in fact i've had to lower my own
calories recently
so up until
a few days ago i was
doing a consistent calorie intake so as
i discussed earlier earlier in my prep i
played around with lower and higher
calorie days
but currently
i have
for a long time now not really used them
again
but now that i need to lower calories
and
i don't really feel like eating less on
trading days what i've done is i've just
removed around 900 calories a thousand
calories for my non-training days which
then when you combine that over a week
or average it across a week results in
around a 350 calorie increase
in my deficit
per day which
in theory should make me lose around an
extra um
300 grams a week or so which
is around
i want to say
a pound and a half per week
uh not a pound and a half like 2 000
pound a week
um
so in my case i've increased my deficit
by simply having
fewer calories on my non-training days
and incorporating lower and higher
calorie days into my contest prep again
um
so i'd say taking seven weeks per week
averaging those weigh-ins um taking an
average of the past seven days for
example is a good idea and then making
that adjustments once a week the reason
you don't want to make that adjustments
more frequently
is because it's simply too small of a
time frame even with averages
to really be certain of any changes like
if on
tuesday you decide okay it's been two
days now and my weight hasn't dropped
and you drop calories
that can often just lead you to make
really
abrupt and
um premature
changes to your intake which then
eventually can either make the light
unsustainable just make it harder it
needs to be and i think typically having
a bit more patience when it comes to
making those eyes adjustments can pay
off especially when
you know your maintenance pretty well
you know how many calories you need and
so just because you had a few off
weigh-ins doesn't mean you now need to
override or
overhaul your whole diet in a matter of
a few days your maintenance hasn't
changed that much and so if your
calories were working before for you a
few days ago it's unlikely that they're
just going to stop working right now
and so i think making that adjustment
once a week is going to do
any less frequently than once a week
and you might just be wasting some time
example if you made diet adjustments
once a month
you know
you might fall out of that for example
ideal
weight loss rate range
so let's say you want to lose between
point five percent and one percent of
body weight per week
if you only make the adjustment diet
adjustments once a month
you might run into a situation whereby
you are
for the first week of that month losing
weight at 0.5 percent bodyweight per
week
but then for the last three weeks you're
actually losing a bit more slowly
and so if you only make adjustments once
a month then
that's just not sufficient to optimize
rate of weight loss and so i think once
a week is a nice middle ground where
it's not so frequent that you make
unnecessary and premature adjustments
but it's also not so infrequent that you
lose out on progress and
waste time essentially
so that's about it as far as that topic
goes
now next i want to discuss my plans for
photoshoots and mock peak weeks
so because my show is now happening in
almost exactly 8 weeks or 56 days 57
days i
want to practice a peak week
now for natural athletes there doesn't
seem to be that much of a benefit to
manipulating sodium and water intake
atom
the main thing for natural athletes on
stage is going to be core manipulation
um
nevertheless though because you don't
quite know how
how a peaking strategy is going to
impact you specifically
it's always worth it to
practice
that peak week
once at least before your actual show
and so in my case
i'm going to plan that mock peak week so
to speak
for my last deal week of the contest
prep which is taking place
i believe
four or five weeks out from my show
which is a good time point to a do a
mock peak week because you're quite lean
and you can
have a pretty good idea of how that
peaking strategy is going to impact your
physique at that body fat level
and b because you're quite lean
that is a lot of police sirens today and
i'm not happy about it um
because you're quite lean
it's also useful because you can do a
photo shoot which you know if you're
dieting anyways for a contest prep you
may as well make use of that
conditioning that you don't often have
because let's be honest getting that
lean is not comfortable it's not easy it
takes time
and so you may as well get some pictures
while you're at it is my view then
in my case my
photo shoots are planned for the 3rd and
4th of october
which is approximately
almost exactly 4 weeks out from my show
the reason i planned this for my dealed
week is
twofold mostly threefold maybe first
reason is
because it's a deal week i can afford i
was going to go
to maintenance calories anyways
and so it's a good time point to do a
peak week because it won't throw off my
cutting progress or my weight loss
progress the second reason is it allows
me to also do the training component of
a peak week whereby you take a few extra
off days you do mostly pump sessions the
days before
and so that also allows me to do it
without into it interfering with either
my muscle mass retention if i was doing
it in a deficit or with
um
my diet overall essentially
and then the third reason is because i
will be dealing i'll also have more free
time because i won't be training as
consistently
and that means i can afford to travel
around to do some photo shoots
yeah so my photo shoots taking place on
the third and fourth of october and i'm
looking forward to them it's my first
time doing any sort of formal photo
shoot
if you don't consider
the
pictures in the changing rooms in my gym
or in the
uh stretching area what have you
so it's gonna be interesting uh i
haven't really had
high quality pictures taken of my
physique before
like i've had some pictures taken with a
decent camera before but not really with
any sort of professional setup or
equipment and so it'll be interesting to
see especially because it feels like
with gym pictures and
pictures i take myself essentially
there's only so much detail you can
capture because the lighting is never
optimized and so
my upper body for example can often
overshadow the lighting for my lower
body and so my lower body looks worse
than it would with
even lighting let's say and so i'm
really curious to see what i look like
with better lighting with professional
equipment etc especially when i'm four
weeks out
i'm still a bit concerned about not
being ready on time
if you've seen my instagram posts you
probably think okay
it seems like he's pretty ready um
but honestly
i think a lot of people underestimate
just how much conditioning or i hate the
wet conditioning but i still keep using
it
just how much
leanness is beneficial and required to
be at your best for bodybuilding
if you want to see an example of what
really good conditioning looks like
again with the conditioning
you can
search for
brian whitaker so whitaker spelled
w-h-i-t-a-c-r-e brian whittaker um
posing wnbf worlds
and it's essentially just him going
through
a posing session
i think like a week out before
a show
and there you can see what being really
lean and contest rate looks like
and so when people now tell me oh you
look pretty much ready for your show you
can step on stage now
i feel
very unprepared at least i feel like i
could go a lot further and benefit from
it
and so i definitely need those remaining
eight weeks to get into
my best shape possible and that's part
of the reason i've
decreased calories because i think i
still have quite a lot of fat to lose
on my instagram pictures you don't
really see it as much
but my hamstrings and glutes for example
still have a pretty fair amount of
fat to lose
and then overall my physique could just
be leaner um
i do have veins in most body parts now
but
i could still be leaner overall like
every body part still has fat to lose
and so these last eight weeks
are going to be quite important in
bringing a good package to a stage
overall in terms of leanness
finally
i wanted to briefly discuss my plans for
the upcoming offseason
in becoming super hungry in the past few
weeks
i've gotten increasingly excited for the
offseason
not only for
regaining some weight and having some
good food
post show
which i am looking forward to a lot
and i'll probably make some videos like
10 000 calorie challenges 20 000 calorie
challenges that sort of thing um
but besides that also just
having an off season where food is less
of a focus and i can focus on
building certain body parts that might
be weak parts of my physique now
for now my assessments my assessment of
my physique hasn't really changed that
much
i don't think my chest and arms are
going to be
as weak as i initially thought they
would be
on stage
i think they'll definitely be on the
weaker side of things
but they also won't be glaringly
weak compared to the rest of my physique
um
nevertheless if i had to pick a few body
parts to specialize on it'll definitely
be my chest and arms for now
potentially my calves as well
but mainly chest norms
and so my plans for the offseason are to
spend
somewhere between six months and five
years
gaining muscle mass um
i probably won't want to compete again
anytime soon
unless like i
randomly win
the show or something and get invited to
worlds what have you which i doubt is
going to happen um so in most
circumstances i probably won't want to
compete at least for another
year and a half i kind of want to finish
my phd before i compete again
um so i'll be spending somewhere between
likely a year and five years uh in an
off season
staying reasonably lean like probably
not going much above
105 110 kilograms long term
in the short term or like 100 because i
don't want to gain more body fat than is
required and i can comfortably maintain
around
95 to 100 kilograms for me
so yeah the aim is going to be spend a
year to five years in an offseason
building
size overall but primarily in weaker
areas
and then eventually provided i enjoy
competing which i'm not sure about yet
i'm
enjoying it but i think i need the whole
experience to really make
a full judgment of it and then decide
whether or not i'm gonna compete again
but yeah provided i enjoy competing i'll
compete again within
maybe one to five years
and after i finish my phd i should have
a bit more
bandwidth or leeway to dedicate to
competing again
um
but yeah that about wraps up this video
if you enjoy the video please leave a
comment like subscribe all the usual
stuff
i'll be making i think like seven more
of these i'll also make up some more
um
videos for show day and a few days
before show day
but for now
if you enjoyed the video please comment
