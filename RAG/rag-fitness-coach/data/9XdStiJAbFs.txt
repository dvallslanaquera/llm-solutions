cooking capitals of the world
flavor culture history talent did
somebody say talent related to cooking
they must be talking about me hey folks
dr mike here again episode 2 of dr
mike's kitchen welcome back
here's the deal
i know you
you have a problem
you're on a fat loss diet and you're
really hungry you need something filling
but if it's filling and super tasty
you're just going to want more of it too
much of it you're going to be miserable
you're going to eat it you're going to
want to eat more of it and you're going
to be sitting there and watching reruns
and fascinated just
just totally
into food and you can't do it anymore
and you want to quit your diet but hold
on
professional chef dr mike is here to
save your day how you may think
here's the thing
you may not have thought this was
possible but on your current brutal tail
end a fat loss diet where you get almost
no macros
you can have
layer cake
why am i doing this scare quotes
i don't know it's just something i
picked up in france when i was learning
how to cook continental cuisine the
reality is you can have
actual layer cake and you can have it
right now you want to make some with me
real quick hey let's do it
every good chef knows that the best
cooking the best food the best taste
experience starts with the best
ingredients and hey why wouldn't we have
them
for this recipe for layer cake on a diet
of course
we have actually a sum total of three
ingredients but dr mike that'll make
this food prep so easy even i can do it
hold on a second get through the rest of
the video because it gets complicated
don't worry i'll walk you through not my
first rodeo ingredient number one
is casey and protein really of any kind
body tex
fine brand
so body tech's delicious and actually
this is a really good brand because its
macros are kind of ludicrous per serving
24 grams of protein one gram of carb
half a gram of fat either they're lying
but this is amazing and i don't think
they're lying so casein protein that's
ingredient number one if you need to
write this down i'll wait ingredient
number two
egg life
life's fine but egg life is better
these pre-made egg white wraps are the
tip of the spear of culinary science i
gotta be honest i'm both a scientist and
a culinary expert i really actually am
one of those things and i have no idea
how they do this this is like tesla
times a trillion technology wise it's a
pre-made and i'll show you in a bit
pre-made egg white wrap
it's just this pan sheet looking thing
of egg whites but the macros the macros
check out the macros they're ridiculous
five grams of protein for every one of
these things zero carbs zero fats what
that means the entire package has like
30 grams of protein and that's it
oh my god you're going to be able to eat
a whole package of these and since
they're
so delicious you won't get very far but
hold on the taste experience is just
beginning
our last ingredient
will be water i didn't know how to i
don't put the water in first i didn't
know how to do this part but that's all
you need casein protein water
egg white wraps and then you have the
beginnings and damn near the ending of
layer cake
how the fuck am i supposed to make
fucking layer cake
out of this old bullshit awful diet food
hey hold on did you go to culinary
school in eight different countries oh
you didn't that's why you don't know the
answer hey
that's okay i know let's get started
all right first
we take one scoop of casein protein and
we put it into an adorable tiny little
bowl if you don't have these at home
make more money or something buy one
they're ridiculous and they're awesome
and then we have to put in the water
casein pudding is incredibly complicated
to make
it's a little bit of water the powder
and then you mix for a while
and out goes the pudding
get in there just a bit
and out we go
and always mix
towards the middle
a lot of the stuff tries to get out on
us but we're too good for it i should
have fucking used a bigger bowl god damn
it
so
juicy so to speak
i'm gonna finish this mixing we'll see
you guys over at the egg station in a
bit egg white wrap time
you could throw this on a motherfucker
face just
hospital trip
[Music]
oh god
fucking perfect
beautiful
this is the beginnings of our layer cake
now follow along
one layer down
then is the application
of the chocolate mousse oui oui
little dab will do remember
eggs are sturdy dab away
and you want to apply not a ton
because you don't want to run out of
this stuff you can always apply a little
more
i love to cook
and i would uh i was three years old i
would make feasts for my whole family
and they're just like
what can't he do this isn't a layer you
might tell yourself this is just like
some kind of egg white casey and pancake
ripoff bullshit doctor mike fucking lied
to us again
but hold on we remove
another egg white from the stack but
you've never fucking heard that side
before
and the utmost care gingerness dare i
even say you apply a layer
don't squeeze
not making burgers at mcdonald's
hold on that's not a layer that's like a
double decker sandwich
just gorgeous
any time you make food
you're not cooking
you're engaging in a relationship a
conversation
another egg white
[Music]
two in the tank
third application
and like every good cake
frosting is in between the layers and on
top
fucking layer cake i told you
motherfuckers are one line now hold up
at renaissance periodization
we under promise and over deliver
each package has three of these
motherfuckers
so guess what you get two layer cakes
wait doctor mike but i'm on a diet
rp baby
[Music]
it's time to eat sumptuous
delicate
moist
layered
[Music]
and my favorite part
technically edible thanks so much for
tuning in
if you can't follow along with the
recipe rewind the video watch slower
take pauses do whatever you have to do
to let it sink in
your shit might not look as good as mine
in a first try or the 10th or 50th but
we're not all experts
do your best
enjoy your diet
