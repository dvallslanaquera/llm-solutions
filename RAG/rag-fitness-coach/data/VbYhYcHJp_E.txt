hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization hypertrophy concepts and
tools
22 lecture 22. if you haven't seen the
others please go back and watch them
the phase potentiation in our little
mini series and face presentation of
loading face potentiation of loading
what are we going to talk about quick
review on face potentiation but uh super
short because of the longer one last
time
the upsides of heavier loading and the
downsides of heavier loading if you were
never going to face potentiate and never
ultra loading if you only ever trained
heavy what are the ups and downs of that
next is if you only trained very light
what are the ups and downs of that
then we're going to talk about the
realities of block length changes like
what happens over training block roughly
three mesocycles in a row for
hypertrophy
but like we sort of need to have in mind
in order to maybe think
okay maybe there is some room for
potentiation here
and then we're going to talk about the
downsides of no loading alterations over
the block like if we were just going to
say we train the same every single block
or sorry every single mezzo of the block
you know where does that lead us and
does it
lead some good places for sure maybe
some not so great places and then we're
going to talk about what loading
alterations over block should probably
look like
if we're really serious about that and
talk about their benefits because there
are a few benefits that are
you know remember this is an advanced
concepts lecture and these are very
small
very minute points but they're
nonetheless ones in which once you have
sort of been shown the landscape
uh you you know just tend to pick one
thing over another
even if it's not a big deal it's still
pretty clearly uh very likely in the
correct direction right
and we're gonna talk about uh how to
load during a maintenance phase because
it is part of uh
you know the sequence of blocks because
you know we do three
mesocycles up and then we have a
maintenance mesoblock it's important to
make sure that we're on the same page
with that
all right so face potentiation remember
that each phase of training has its own
goals right but it is also
set up by its previous phase hopefully
and sets up the next phase
it's not a standalone so we always have
to think of two things we do any
training phase
how is this going to work to enhance
hypertrophy in this phase and how is it
going to work
to set up hypertrophy uh in the next
phase we can't just think uh
just all of a sudden and how does this
apply to
loading in hypertrophy training
specifically all right
what are the upsides and downsides of
heavier loading training
in this case we mean sets that fall
close to failure in the 5 to 10 rep
range okay
so there are distinct upsides they
probably stimulate the faster fibers
more in an absolute sense per set than
lighter training it's a good thing
faster fibers grow more than slow-twitch
fibers so
definitely a good thing to have um
they're likely indispensable for optimal
hypertrophy if you told a coach
a high-level bodybuilding said listen i
want to get the most muscle i possibly
can
they would be remiss to negate the five
to 10 rep range altogether they would
probably say look look some of your
training should be having not all but at
least some
and it probably this kind of training
activates hypertrophy mechanisms very
well
but activates catabolic volume based
mechanisms probably not so well which is
kind of a good thing for example amp
kinase and other fatigue
sensitive structures or sorry uh
molecular mechanisms
and what ends up happening is that this
way this kind of training sustainably
adds muscle
at least from a biochemical sense for
many many months on end
right if you do super high reps and
super high volumes those result in
then in general a lot of metabolites a
lot of times and we'll talk about this
in a little bit
you get sort of a blunting of the growth
response at least theoretically
predicted after a little while
for a couple of reasons with heavy
training that probably doesn't happen
nearly as much right so if you train
only in a 5 to 10 rep range ever you
could probably grow really consistently
okay
however there are downsides really
really legitimate ones that are gonna
essentially inform how we face
potentiate this sort of training
if you train exclusively in the 510 rep
range or when you train in that rep
range
that taxes the joints in connective
tissues considerably attacks are
considerably more than lighter training
for example training in the
10 to 20 or the 20 to 30 rep range it
just does just
hits your joints and connected fishes
more it cannot for that reason be ramped
up to very high volumes also
at high volumes this kind of training
tends to be in general very systemically
from a neurological perspective etc
very very fatiguing and it cannot be
ramped up to very high volumes again for
the joint connective fissure stuff and
the incredible fatigue it causes
it is not very compatible with high
frequencies yeah you can train high
frequencies for perch if you've
there's some light work in there but if
it's like sets of five to eight in a
squat four times a week for the love of
god like you're gonna break down real
fast
doing that it's just not really
sustainable maybe twice a week is four
times maybe not
and many isolation exercises are simply
incompatible with this form of training
you know you're probably not gonna do
lateral races in the five to ten rep
range you might not do dips in the
factor 10 rep range you might not do
skull crushers and so on and so forth
so all of a sudden this is a very good
range of training has its benefits but
it's also not this golden range that we
can use
all the time okay and it's not for
everything
on the other hand we have the lighter
loading range and it has its upsides
remember lighter loading range is 20 to
30 reps 10 to 20 range you can we're not
even going to discuss here because it's
sort of the middle ground and it's got a
lot of the benefits
of the heavier range and of the lighter
range and some of the downsides as well
so it's kind of middle ground here but
you can interpolate that no problem so
the upsides of lighter load training is
that it probably stimulates slower
twitch fibers more um and those d under
stimulated
with very low rep training with heavier
training because what ends up happening
is you're just not
having a ton of volume of work on those
fibers and those fires
probably respond better to higher
volumes of work so for example when you
do a set of five
your slower trick fibers are karate
kicking it they're ready and
you as soon as your faster fibers
basically fail
the weight cannot be lifted anymore
because there's a huge amount of weight
to lift and the slower fibers can't make
that up
so the slower fibers are active the
entire time but only for five reps
in a set of 25 the slower treat fibers
are active the entire time
and because they're slower twitch
they're actually probably maximally
active that entire time
they get way more work like five times
the actual per fiber tension work
and which means that high reps probably
just grow them best in a way that uh
you can't do with any reasonable volume
of lower wrap heavier weight sets so
definitely something that remember you
have a lot of slower trick fibers in
your body and for
optimal hypertrophy you want hypertrophy
all fibers which is that second point
is that the lighter training is
indispensable for optimal hypertrophy it
has to be some combination of heavier
and light
very likely to your absolute very best
it's for sure
much easier on the joint of connective
connective tissues this is not something
it's one of these categories i would
insert is not not debatable by
by thinking open-minded people you know
it's kind of like vaccines cause autism
like yeah that's cool
to believe if you're completely insane
but if you're a normal person you'll be
like well that sounds really stupid
based on everything i've ever read
you read it over again you conclude it's
also stupid but people have said that
lighter weight is not
easier on the joints i just don't think
those people trained with weights or
have or any coached anybody so i'll
leave that as it is
so if you're looking for research
studies to support that don't bother uh
you know it's one of those things that
should be relatively obvious and
not many things like that in the world
but this is sure one of them uh and
because it's much easier on the joints
this kind of training the lighter
training can be rough to ramp it up to
very high volumes
very high frequencies and using
isolation exercises high frequencies
point especially pertinent
because look if you're doing sets of 20
or 30 your joints feel great the next
day
you can do the shit again the next day
you don't have to you know if you're
doing sets of five heavy
you just can't do that the next day in
all cases especially as you get stronger
especially with compound exercises right
uh and if you're doing a hyper
hypercaloric diet and uh especially and
any kind of high volume training for
multiple mesocycles
there tends to be a fiber transition
from faster to slower twitch variants
this kind of training isn't really
affected much by that because it favors
the slower twitch variants anyway
so as you get really fatigued in a
long-term diet your ability to lift sets
of five to ten might actually
significantly degrade you have to lower
the loads all of a sudden the
hypertrophy hypertrophic stimulus
may not be as great and also psychology
there your performance is down it's
tough to stay motivated
but with higher upsets a lot of times
you just get better and better and
better at those even as you lose fat
even as
your fatigue goes up from an ampk
modulated perspective because
that pathway also makes you able to do
more reps and potentially allows you
to get in lots of volume for the
slow-church fibers not a really big deal
there
however there are downsides it's not all
magic uh slower twitch uh
oh sorry higher up training probably
stimulates the faster switch fibers much
less
i would bet that it's a significant
amount it's not a huge amount but it's
definitely significant
the whole effect of reps idea that if
you do a set of 30 to failure
just as much work in the last five reps
for the faster fibers has been subject
to
very considerable criticism criticism i
think is quite valid
your faster fibers are so tired by them
from just getting bashed in with
metabolites for everything else and
nervous systems so tired by then and so
difficult to push that pain
that a set of five to failure is way
more qualitatively and quantitatively
better work for your faster fibers in a
way they can't get
if that set of five is pushed with
lighter weight to the end of a set of
30.
right so definitely less faster fiber
simulation which is not a great thing
because faster fibers grow a lot
and if you really put your stock into
doing a lot of sets of 20 to 30
uh it tends to be that metabolite
buffering gets really really good really
fast within an
order of weeks ampk is upregulated very
quickly from such high volumes and
remember it's catabolic
and vascularization increases or
capillarization rather
in your muscles which helps the
buffering even more so what ends up
happening is that occlusion
high metabolite effect that you get from
the high rep training which is one of
the ways in which it grows the most
muscle
tends to be something that doesn't occur
and there's direct literature support
this by the way
it doesn't tend to occur for very long
so if you really do a ton of training at
20 30 rep range
it becomes uh probably incrementally
less effective much faster than sets of
five to ten
or sets of ten to twenty so what ends up
happening is it's not something you
wanna use all the time
uh to a great extent you can use it all
the time to small extent but if you
really really start to use it a lot
then there's probably a trade-off there
as it just sort of burns out much
quicker
all right so those are the upsides and
downsides let's look at the realities of
block like
length changes which is to say the
situation you're presented in mesocycle
one of the block is not the same as
you're going to may be entering
mesocycle 2 and it's not the same at all
that you're going to be entering
motorcycle 3. there's not a complete
refresh between mesocycles and a block
there are some things that change over
the mesocycles predictably for example
fatigue accumulates now a lot of fatigue
can get rid of a d-load but joint in
connective tissue fatigue you often
can't
so that requires a maintenance phase and
or a an active rest phase
and if you go meso one measure two meso
three by meso three your joints
connective tissues are just not feeling
the same way
you may not preview hint the up for
increasing incrementally in volume
sets of five to ten as much as you maybe
would have loved to do in mesocycle one
right
next one volume needs climb your mav
goes up every single mesocycle
your volume needs go up but at the same
time your fatigue is accumulating and
your joints and connective tissues can't
do as much work
at heavier loads it seems like a
conundrum there that we could
potentially solve with some modulation
right
higher frequencies are often used as we
go from block mesoderm
to boost volume further great news again
but we're in a situation where we need
higher frequencies which tax during
connective tissues more
and we're simultaneously bringing in to
begin meso three for example
higher joints and connective tissue
stress from earlier measurements it's a
double whammy
really as you can tell plays against
doing more and more and more sets of
five to ten as the
block goes on because what are we doing
we're basically funneling into a doubly
bad situation
for that rep range and a lot of times
the exercises that are best
used to boost volume uh and added in for
a higher frequency
and thus volume as the mesos progress
tend to be more isolation in nature
because they don't contribute as much
systemic fatigue and that can often be
maxed out
um and you know essentially your mrv
your systemic mrv is pretty close to
being
maxed out and you can't just add to tons
more compounds right like
you might add a leg extension or lunge
in mouth cycle three but you're probably
not going to add another session of high
bar
heavy squats that sets a five to ten
right so you can kind of see where this
is going so those are the realities
and that's just what we're the hand
we're dealt right so how do we respond
best to that well we couldn't have no
response at all
and you say you know we're gonna train
with the same load
ratios the entire three mesocycles for
example
of a training block so measure one
measure two measure three let's see we
just
do twenty five percent of our volume in
the five to ten range fifty percent the
ten to twenty
twenty five percent and twenty to thirty
we have a couple problems a couple
downsides that end up uh biting us there
so
we have to add volume and frequency to
some extent to keep the hypertrophic
response close to optimal
uh and if we're not willing to add
in some ranges more than others we have
to add a lot of it in the heavy range
okay
uh even in meso3 and
by then the joint connective tissue
fatigue that that creates can be
untenable like two or three micro cycles
in the meso three you can be like i
can't
squat anymore my hips are done i sure
wish i had done leg extensions
instead of squats so big problem and
even by the time meso3 rolls around like
the point from the other slide
our connective tissues and joints might
already be really really trashed
so even if we don't add any compound
work in meso3 the compound work we've
already done could have already caught
up with us and
everything at that point is is really
garbage and it's very very difficult to
train very hard
and we you know
have to add compounds uh
friendly to the heavier ranges right so
because you know we have to train in the
heavy range
25 we said so we have to add frequency
at some point we're
chasing our volume landmarks so it means
we have to add compounds
so you know in meso two and three adding
a bunch of compounds
is real gnarly because it increases uh
axial fatigue and systemic fatigue
like crazy that's a huge liability you
look at your plan you're like all right
i guess i have a new day in which i'll
be training back time to do
more heavy barbell rows and like holy
shit why don't you do
you know light pull downs be like well
no no we have a certain amount of
volume we have to fill every time with
heavy work maybe not the greatest idea
anymore
and the inverse problem is if we start
out with a real big fraction of our
training in the very
high rep ranges meso one remember twenty
five percent measure one and meso two
and meso three is uh high rep range
20 30. by meso three that high rep range
has been done for two messes already
it's not very effective
so we're gonna have to ramp up and do
way more volume to get the same
hypertrophic stimulus even from the
light ranges which ends up being that we
essentially our stimulus to fatigue
ratio
it declines right because the fatigue
proxies how much volume we're adding but
the stimulus is lower and lower and
lower
so we used to be able to get a ton out
of six sets of high rep pull downs
now we need 10 sets to do the same job
but remember 10 sets produce more
fatigue than the six sets
so it's a bad deal right we've
essentially used our one trick pony a
few tricks too early
so maybe not the greatest thing uh you
can totally have no loading alterations
over the block and especially
if you're a beginner a lot of beginners
get a full relatively full reset between
mesocycles like that d-load takes care
of almost everything
they can approach every messa cycle as
if it's a new block for intermediate
folks and especially advanced folks this
is not the case and they
would be best benefited paying attention
to some some of these things right
so how do we go about proposing to fix
these things and
actually look at load alterations over
the course of a training block message
so hypothetically we could do is do a
bit more heavy work on the first meso
and more light work in the last meso and
the middle meso will be something
intermediate
okay so here's the deal
people will see that and automatically
think including myself
so you're saying we do a lot of heavy
work on the first mezzo
and then we do less heavy work and then
less heavy work so there's very little
heavy work
in the last meso so for example if we do
10 sets of heavy squats in the first
mezzo we're going to do eight sets of
squats in a second
six sets of squats in the third not
exactly
what you do is you actually do the same
absolute amount of heavy work in meso
one meso two and meso three
but remember our volume requirements
total rise from meso one to meso two
from meso three
so in meso one we do this much heavy
work in meso two this much heavy work in
meso three that's much heavy work
what about moderate work in meso one we
do you know some
in meso two we do more in a meso three
we do the same so there's been one bump
in moderate
and then what about light work in meso
one we do well very little
in meso two we do more and in meso three
we do the most
so the average volume total volume goes
up the entire time the volume is simply
funneled
more and more from the lighter ranges as
you go so in the first range
we have lots of heavy work you know
decent amount of moderate work and very
little light work
in the second meso still have the same
amount of
heavy work nothing's changed but more
work way more is starting to come from
moderate and a little bit more from
light
and then the last meso we can really
turn on the fire for our light work
our moderate work is already pretty much
maxed out heavy work doesn't change
moderate work doesn't change
light work really goes up and all of a
sudden it's our highest
volume meso but that volume is
exclusively in last miles that come from
light work so that makes
really really good sense so the relative
amount of heavy work goes down the
entire time
only because the total work goes up from
the moderate and eventually the light
ranges
and that way all the exercises that are
heavy they stay heavy
which is a very good thing so squats
you're never going to do squats in the
five to 10
squats in 10 to 20 squats on a 20 30
which is stupid right it's a violation
you would do squats in the 5 to 10
squats in the 5 to 10 squats in the 5 to
10 you get great progress
and you can push momentum on heavy
weights and stimulate faster fibers no
problem
but in meso 2 when you add an exercise
you might add in leg presses for sets of
10 to twenty
and then on meso three when you add
another exercise you might end up adding
walking lunges
four sets of twenty to thirty so the
volume goes up and the exercises are
specific to the rep range
which is really really good so again
training does not get
lighter over the block it doesn't you're
not getting weaker over the block
taking out heavy work and replacing it
with light you layer in a base of heavy
work
then you layer in more moderate work and
then the top is you layer a little bit
more light work so
it's like building a layer cake but as
you go mesut or mesodermazo the cake
gets bigger
that doesn't mean the bottom parts of
the cake get any smaller just relative
to the rest of the cake they're smaller
towards the end
so what are the benefits of this sort of
load alteration
over the training block so first of all
you can progress on loading heavy
exercises from a neurological
perspective technical perspective and
get the most out of remember
getting the most for quad growth out of
heavy squats there's a lot of technique
involved there's a lot of mind muscle
connection there's a lot of stability
involved
finding your perfect sfrs finding your
stances it's not something you just want
to do for one motorcycle and let go of
especially if it's heavy
so it's good because you get to do this
heavy work for three entire mesocycles
which is great you get to get way
stronger on it or really milk it out for
everything it's worth
as opposed to putting it in one meso and
then taking it out
now set heavy loading doesn't go up in
sets over the meso you might do like
an average of eight sets of heavy work
you know per muscle group per meso in
meza one
eight sets of meso two eight sets in
meso three it's just the other work it
adds to the sets and because of that
joint and connective tissue fatigue
doesn't rise as rapidly imagine you go
from eight
to ten to twelve holy crap by the end
you would be you know just completely
mangled
but in this case because heavy work
doesn't rise in the fraction of volume
it's not really as big of a deal as it
could be now of course you still
accumulate considerable amount of joint
connective tissue fatigue but it's
really incomparable to if you increase
just the heavy zone the entire time
right
so this way you can productively finish
the block with hard training instead of
workarounds which is
really bad workouts are basically like
well i did way too much heavy squatting
now my hips are shot now i need to just
do leg extensions because i can't even
do leg presses anymore bad way to finish
the block
doesn't promote optimal hypertrophy all
the volume additions
that you make in a mesocycle for this
reason that uh
sorry in the in the block during the
meso of course you add volume
uh in all the ranges or the ones you
find uh are to be highest sfr
but block to block to block your volume
editions are moderate
and light right which allows for you to
add more volume because you can do more
volume in these ranges
it allows you to add more frequency so
the frequency expansion is awesome
because it's modern light training you
can pepper in higher frequencies
and these new exercise introductions
don't cause a huge
almost like exponential rise in systemic
and joint connective tissue fatigue
as if you added the heavy ranges
exclusively
you know the one does not simply mean
one does not simply go from five sets of
heavy squats to 15 sets of heavy squats
over the course of a block and survive
but you can do five sets of heavy squats
in the first mesocycle
and then the second mesocycle do five
sets of heavy squats and
five sets of moderate leg presses no
problem and then the last
metacycle you can just barely survive
five sets of fixed squats
five centimeter leg presses and five
sets of high rep lunges
uh for the lightest work and yeah that's
really tough that last one's not
sustainable but luckily it's the end of
the meso because if you tried five 10 15
heavy squats
by the second meso you would be toast
right just not a sustainable thing
another good piece of news you don't
really blast the light work until the
end so you don't have to worry about it
extinguishing itself right when it drops
off an effect
you're actually done which is really
really good and
bonus round as your fibers especially in
a fat loss phase convert and they do
this a little bit anyway in any phase
convert from faster twitch to slower
twitch uh it's awesome because you're
exploiting the kind of modalities that
train the slower twitch incrementally
more as fibers convert more which is
sweet it would be
really shitty if it was the other way
around good news this is kind of a
preview
of the next slide the maintenance phase
or the active rest phase
actually reconverts your fibers very
likely to faster twitch variants
which means the next metal cycle you
start hey look at that most of your work
is heavy work or more of it
that way it's actually more tailored to
the kind of fiber type you have at the
time it makes a lot of sense when you
put it together
lastly what do we do with the
maintenance phase well the maintenance
phase
for beginners intermediates they can
benefit from doing only heavy or mostly
heavy work five to ten rep range
that means they get more practice at
higher loads which is better better
technical proficiency at higher loads
which they can take into the rest of
their career to get more jacked
uh it improves their technique it can
increase their axial strength
right the strength of the core mostly we
mean like
shoulder stability muscles and spinal
erector musculature in your abdominals
the ability to bear it under heavy loads
do barbell rows heavy
do deadlift heavy do squats heavy and
not have you know your weak back
limiting your legs and your glutes and
so forth that's awesome it supports
long-term development makes you super
super fucking jacked
that kind of stuff is great uh and it's
trained by keeping heavy training in
more often than not so if you do lots
of maintenance phases where you go super
light you may not get a lot of that
axial
growth and strength but if your
maintenance phases are essentially
strength phases at very low volumes
you can bring in a stronger core each
time and make sure your limbs are really
the limiting factor
like they're damn well supposed to be in
most exercises right
on the other hand more advanced lifters
might be very very beat up from joint
connective tissue perspective because of
two things one
they've had a whole career beat
themselves to shit and that stuff
accumulates
and two they're usually very strong and
pushing very close to a genetic limit
so they're just gonna take a bigger
beating you know like if you say oh man
my squat my squats really united me
annihilated me this last blockage 135
pounds for sets 10 towards the end
if someone advanced could roll their
eyes and be like yahoo you know your
knees don't even feel that
but if you know you're squatting 405 for
sets of 10 towards the end of a a block
you know holy crap like that's going to
take a toll
qualitatively different it is not a toll
that is can be relatively scaled
to lighter weight so more advanced
lifters might be so beat up
that they might actually just choose to
maintain at moderate loads or light
loads
and because they choose to maintain a
model loads or light loads uh
sometimes they can actually just turn
this maintenance phase into just an
active rest phase
uh and run fewer maintenance phases more
active rest phases because the active
rests
are not as long you don't require
strength boost by then your core
musculature is very
strong and you have to back away so much
from training anyway you might as well
make it an active rest
that is a whole lot of information folks
give this some thought
especially hopefully these slides are
numbered for you and if they're not
it's the slide with the the colors on it
and the block the meso one two three
loading slide that's one to really take
a look at some more
give it some thought to make sure you're
designing your programs approach really
folks i will see you next time
for lecture number 23 about frequency
alteration over the train
