and one last one i promise go up up up
up up and then slow
slow
[Music]
hey folks dr mike here
jen aguirre is here and
she is actually a super busy mom and
she's got a run
real shortly after this video so we
thought we're going to do two things one
destroy her dealts and two
chat with you guys
off camera after she leaves about maya
reps because this whole workout is only
going to be two exercises each one
loaded with my reps what the hell am i
of they are a way of getting in a highly
intense amount of work in a relatively
short time well that sounds like magic
how's it gonna work the trade-off is
it's absolutely brutal to do but that's
not my problem today because jen's gonna
be the one taking the pain let's get
into the delt stuff right now
exercise number one we are going to do
rear delt machine flies
not a really overloading exercise not a
lot of raw stimulus magnitude but
stimulus fatigue ratio can be good if
you line up the technique there's an
infinite infinite infinite temptation to
be a fucking animal and do this shit
yeah man i use whole fucking stack on
machine
side lateral rear laterals it doesn't
make any sense let me brag about so what
you want to do is stop at the top
squeeze your rear delts and then
eccentrically control them for the mind
muscle connection until you get down
here and then repeat the maya reps thing
is this she's gonna do one set of like
15 to 20 reps and then take three to
five second breaks to do another three
to five reps another three to five reps
another three to five hours high like
five or six times that whole thing takes
maybe two or three minutes that's the
entire exercise it's about an exercise
worth of stimulus that's two to three
minutes long brutal but maybe you
usually do 20 or 30 minutes if you know
people come up and you're like yeah look
rear delts bro and you talk to them for
a while you cool down you start again
that type of shit let's get going seven
excellent
longer hold
hold down eight
[Music]
nine beautiful jen that was excellent
10. phenomenal you're like a machine
over here keep it going
11. beautiful
12.
now let's get serious get those holds
going must reach 15 14 hold yep down
and again
was that 15 yeah one more for good luck
hold
and slow
and down beautiful relax rest breathe
breathe take your time
i'll let you know when okay
[Music]
three to five reps go
excellent one
two
hold three one more
one more must happen
hold and slow
and rack
good job relax breathe
good
[Music]
nice and easy nice and easy i'll let you
know when
[Music]
three reps go
good
one
two
that is awesome technique
[Music]
three
one more
one more fuck it
[Music]
oh that's it good relax rest
good we're gonna do one more set
feeling in the rear delts yes good
take a nice long little break here we're
gonna do three high quality ones
three hit it
[Music]
one
[Music]
two
last one hold for one full second hold
hold hold down slow
and that's it
perfect
that's it take a break take a drink next
up we got side delts just two exercises
today
oh my god
[Music]
all right rear delts are well on their
way to being toasted
now it's time to finish off the rear
delts and the side delts and hey why not
the traps as well
with super range of motion laterals
super arm laterals
are they the best side delt exercise no
but they are in a
oh probably five to ten exercise list of
the best can you do regular laterals of
course can you do thumbs down laterals
totally can you do all kinds of other
variations yes but the super arms
accomplish an awesome task again fire
ups we're gonna kick it to jen she's
gonna do like 15 to 20 reps and then
she's gonna wait three to five seconds
and do another three to five reps for
like five or six sets if we get real
balls deep with her where her arms don't
work anymore we might do the last set
with just her hands and yes that is
actually not junk volume because all the
muscles are so close to fit at that
point it's all a stimulus
let's get it done 14.
control
15 keep going no swinging
yes 16 slow slow slow slow more
17 slow
slow slow no swing at the front just
raise your arms raise them go
go go go go go go go go slow
slow
slow
slow one more gen let's get to 20.
now slow
slow
slow
slow slow rock
good job
good job that was awesome
[Music]
breathe it out breathe it out
[Music]
three to five
three to five reps let's do it same high
quality no bullshit on the top end let's
go
yes
slow
oh yeah they're already lit
up
good
slow we are here to fucking work let's
go up up up up yes slow
i want one more but no swinging or i
don't fucking count it only shoulders
only shoulders yes
and slow
slow
slow slow
wrap
good stuff good stuff we need three more
of those
three more
you're doing great your shoulders look
enormous
my traps are huge too
[Music]
good
beautiful
slow
perfect again
ah
slow
slow
slow no cheating raise your arms go
raise your arms
up
that was bullshit but okay
extra slow extra slow
so take a break hold them hold them
breathe redeem yourself one strict rep
right now
two more sets left and the whole
workout's done
[Music]
yes
slow
that's one i need two more no swinging
now slow
[Music]
last one
go
up up up up yes slow
slow
slow
slow
wrap
one set of three left i'll let you know
when to start you're a fucking warrior
jeff this is good stuff
let's finish strong good technique only
we won't count bad technique reps
yes
slow
up
go go go go go go go go slow
and one last one
right now
go
up that's it that's failure drop them
drop them drop and drop them i got
something for you take your hands out
lock out your elbows now raise them just
like that by themselves
and then down slow
and then raise them again go
up
and then down slow slow slow slow slow
slow and one more rep go up all the way
to the top all the way to the top all
the way to the top and then down slow
slow slow slow
and then one last one i promise go up up
up up up and then slow
slow don't let me push you down don't
let me push you down don't let me push
you down don't let me push you down
i can't do that
huh i can't do that
oh my god
jen
left it all on the gym floor today
huge delt destruction remember that was
two exercises and basically five sets of
each the whole workout took
a sum total of actual lifting probably
three minutes or something like that and
then with brakes and everything it's 15
minutes and the delts are done but don't
take it for me how do your doubts feel
uh i
i couldn't drink water if i wanted to
i totally can't this is the last time
you hear from jen she's gonna die of
first in a few hours folks thank you so
much for tuning in jen huge thanks to
you for showing up again and uh and
taking the full effort amazing stuff
do you guys want me again
vote in the comments below mio reps
what are they and why do we do them you
guys have probably seen a lot of
myself uh and jared feather used these
in our own training on instagram and
through youtube with various folks that
we've been training so far
what are my reps so intellectually if
you're looking at it myo reps are a
subcategory of rest pause type of
training rest pause basically means
instead of taking a conventional amount
of time between sets so traditional sets
straight sets or you do the weight or
whatever you get tired you get close to
failure you put it down and you rest
until you can do another full-fledged
set again which is our sort of four
checkpoint list you know you're not
breathing super heavy anymore
neurologically you have some drive etc
etc etc now that's fine but then there's
the rest pause category which is an
offshoot of uh traditional training so
there's straight sets then there's rest
pause rest pause is when for some reason
or another
you shorten the rest break between sets
and that some reason or another depends
on what kind of breast pausing you do
this kind of rest pausing that we're
doing here today is called maya reps it
was essentially formulated and really
really well explained and termed i
believe by berger fagrelli i promise you
i butchered that last name or first name
he's from norway he's a great guy and
what he basically said was look
the last three to five repetitions
generally of a set
are not the only stimulative ones but
they're probably a fractionally at least
a bit more stimulative than what we call
the lead-in repetitions so if you're
doing a set of 15 the first 10
absolutely do stimulate muscle growth
and don't get it twisted they do
but the last five probably stimulate a
little bit more muscle growth if we're
counting rep by rep by wrap through that
set
so if you're short on time what you can
do is the following
one set of 15 to 20 reps to get all the
lead in reps and get close to failure
and get really fatigued
lactic acid and other ion accumulation
in the muscles
all the muscles are essentially close to
their failure points already then you
rest three to five seconds sometimes a
little bit longer even five to ten
depending on the muscle group and so on
and so forth and then you do another set
of three to five reps which is to say
you again get into the last three to
five reps right so you're not using a
weight that's a three to five rm weight
because that would be crazy you'd have
to rest full time you're using a set a
weight that's 15 to 20 reps you do the
15 to 20 reps close to failure or to
failure rest three to five seconds do
another set of three to five so you're
essentially repeating that last set of
three to five
that you did after those 10 other reps
or 15 of the reps you just did in that
set of 15 to 20. and then you do it
again and then you do it again you do it
again so visually you can see set of 15
to 20 and then another set of three to
five another set of three to five
another set of three to five so another
way to look at it is for all of that
work we do first set and then the four
or five other sets after it the mile rep
sets for all that work we've done
physical mechanical work of actually you
know doing the super roms or whatever
the fraction of that that is very close
to failure is very high the fraction of
that that's in those more hypertrophic
last three to five reps is well
everything but the first 10 to 15 reps
everything after that is super close is
this the answer to training well for
some exercises it's not for some
exercises maya reps are impossible
squats because the setup is so hard and
re-racking is so hard and it's such a
centrally taxing cardiovascularly taxing
exercise what's going to limit you is
breathing and just your ability to just
generate force neurologically so that if
you do maya reps with squats it's gonna
be a giant disaster where you're like i
feel like this whole thing was cardio i
don't even feel my muscles engaging on
top my reps are only appropriate on
braced machine movements where you don't
have to load the action skeleton bent
rows out deadlift out overhead presses
out squats out curls you can do laterals
you can do triceps you can do
some exercises some machines are more
conducive to myoreps which you ideally
want from my reps is that during they're
very hard for that muscle but not for a
lot of other stuff so that when you rest
three to five you actually feel pretty
decent like you can go again and that's
how you determine specifically how much
rest to take what you want to do
to determine how much rest you take
between my rep sets is you want to start
again when you feel like okay i can do
these next three to five reps with
quality but i can do no more than three
to five reps because i'm going to be
that close to failure because if you're
like
that's not going to be a quality set
which by definition means that my rep
should be done on relatively small
muscle groups most of the time you can
do your back and stuff but it has to be
like chest supported really braced rome
so that after you're done
you're ready to go again and ready to go
hard that's my reps is it magic no is it
more effective than regular training
it's not it is two things shorter in
duration which can save you time like we
did with jen today if you have other
things to do going on great for
vacations but you think like wait it's
just short on time and the same as
everything else isn't that better no
because there's a trade-off it's fucking
brutal it's brutally difficult to not do
junk volume and actually push yourself
close to failure that many times if you
can do that maya reps are a tool you put
in your toolbox that works
it's a part of the rest pause process
which is a part of the normal training
process give that some thought let us
know questions comments concerns
in the comments and we'll get to it uh
just a little bit of knowledge for you
guys that's all we have
peace
[Music]
