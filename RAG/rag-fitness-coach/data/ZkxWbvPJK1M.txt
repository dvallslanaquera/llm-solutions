hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization
and it turns out
that calories in calories out is a myth
this is not how the world works man
it turns out that hormones and
ketones
magic wait wait no no no
kaiko's not a myth and the idea that
it's myth is BS all safe swearing for
the end of this
so the idea that calories in calories
out is a myth
is promulgated and propagated by various
folks in the fitness industry
and it turns out that it's not a myth so
let's get into the realities
first
calories in calories out
is essentially covered
in the mass energy conservation
principle aka the first law of
thermodynamics
and that first law of thermodynamics to
my Virgin Eyes perusing the literature
has yet to be broken ever
in any system
definitely in a biological system and in
all studied systems so far
just seems to be never ever broke
but a lot of people say but it doesn't
apply in biological systems and they're
wrong
but how do they get this wrong
it turns out it's pretty tempting to get
this wrong
because of a couple of
oh
illusory things that can occur
here are a few of them
first when people say look I know kaiko
is real calories and calories out kaiko
it's like Geico except no gecko or you
eat the gecko
he's so nice and British and all of a
sudden there's a pole through his body
and uh you're rotating him and don't
worry he's already dead but he's just
like
just sizzling it probably tastes pretty
good in any case
people say look I know kaiko is real but
I like ate a crap ton of calories for
months I didn't gain weight and another
time I ate almost nothing and I gained
weight
and it turns out that people are just
really bad on average tons of exceptions
of course and you're one of them
of accounting for diet and activity and
they're just really bad at tracking
so they'll think they ate something
where in reality they forgot it was this
much versus that much they mismeasured
they say they did 30 minutes of cardio
but they reduced their daily walking and
they never measure that
so because they misconstrued it they say
hey look you know typical thing I'll see
on
social media if someone will be like
look I've been in a surplus but I'm not
gaining uh how do you know you're a
surplus assumption assumption assumption
incorrect three assumptions they're not
really in a surplus so that's definitely
a thing that happens
next
people assume a stable metabolic rate
when that rate can actually change
for example if you are low on thyroid
hormones it can look like calories and
calories out doesn't work except the
calories out part is way down because
your thyroid stopped working and when
you get on thyroid medication all of a
sudden calories in calories out works
again it was never the calories and
calories not that was the problem it was
the fact that your hormonal systems were
no longer
pushing up that calories out part of the
equation
water weight another culprit
water weight is humongous in this case
because people will assume that their
body weight and tissue is the same thing
that their reflexive proxy variables of
each other so what they'll say is we
know I ate the this many calories and I
just didn't lose weight
all right but is that because you're
storing more body water over time
because you're eating more salty foods
you're drinking more fluids
time of the month who knows or is it
because you're just not burning any more
tissue because it's probably not the
burning tissue stuff when I've had
clients in the past to fix their body
water issues usually by starting to
track their fluid and sodium and
realizing holy crap I've just been
increasing this for a while because I'm
so hungry that I just drink a bunch of
diet drinks because they're sugary and I
want more of that and I'm eating a bunch
of salt and because it tastes good and
then it turns out I was gaining body
water this whole time and as soon as
that flushed out hey I'd lost five
pounds over the past five weeks just
like thermodynamics would have expected
another thing
is assuming a stability in digestion
where there's definitely some flux going
on some foods are harder or easier to
digest and there's not a one-to-one
pairing of things that go into the mouth
and things that end up getting
anabolized into your tissues
and uh I watched this God this was so
painful my wife and I listened to this
podcast it was like a major news outlet
that has like a podcast or a reporter
goes out and Records herself in the
field and like this reporter sounded
like the most
Valley Girl
vocal fry she was like and then uh uh we
went uh to the like uh Market uh
uh Batman get to the point
in any case she did this thing where she
talked to some scientists and they're
like well you know like when you eat
almonds some of them may digest much
less and you poop a lot of them out
versus fat as presented as an oil or a
butter so when you read the labels and
it's off and that's why calories and
calories out is inaccurate or it doesn't
work and it's like you know that's a
calorie label problem in a food
processing problem those calories that
doesn't mean into your mouth it means
into your system
most of what you eat in your mouth ends
up in the system a huge fraction of it
but with some foods it's a little less
and more than you would expect so it
turns out that
I don't know of anyone that had trouble
losing weight because they were eating
nuts and didn't know about it or
something but on the margins there are
literally little idiosyncrasies you
could point out they do not refute kaiko
they just say that all the calories in
means calories in processed by the
system and if you're pooping them out it
doesn't take a rocket science just to
figure out like well yeah except for the
stuff you poop out
so theoretically there's no problem with
calories and calories out
and
a lot of people will misconstrue body
composition changes for the first law of
thermodynamics violations
they say well look you're saying
calories in calories out Works explain
this
I ate a super keto diet with tons of
veggies and lean meats
I start 200 pounds uh and I ended at 200
pounds except it was shredded and more
Jack like I got you did you start trt
well yeah I did okay did you start
lifting weights six times a week man RP
hypertrophy app like oh my man a
satisfied customer thank you so much sir
you built a bunch of muscle and burnt a
bunch of fat
your mass is still the same because you
were eating at maintenance and they're
like oh yeah all right
so I guess kaiko really is real bring it
in baby we hugged it out
ended up being like you know when you
pull away from a hug and both of you
catch eyes for a sec and you have this
thing where you're like
why we shouldn't we shouldn't kiss I'm
gonna be good it would be crazy that'd
be crazy if we just made out right now
it would be crazy if we held each other
for a little second longer than Society
wants us to you know that would be nuts
why would we do that so him and I had
that little Dynamic and
it was a good man
Scott you remember Frank
they don't call him Scott the video guy
for nothing it was in the video industry
a long time exercise videos
do not impress Scott the video guy he
seen a lot through that lens
in any case
the tldr of all this is people get the
calories inside wrong with bad
assumptions
they get the state transformations in
the body wrong muscle and fat and vice
versa and to get the out wrong because
they misestimate their activity in
thermogenesis and hormonal burning
kaiko is as real as it gets
but in the real world of assumption and
measurement
um sometimes you got to be patient to
see it working out
and you have to make sure that your
assumptions are what they are
patient
plug in the right calories if after a
few weeks you don't see the changes
don't think kaiko doesn't work just
lower or raise your calories to what you
think they should be to make your weight
go up or down
and you've got a winning formula hey
before I leave
when you have an opportunity to come in
for that second hug and make the grand
gesture do it you can only love truly
once in your life
am I supposed to say something at the
end of this video
oh yeah
oh yes
subscribe if you're a want to be in our
members Channel because we got tons of
great videos team full ROM Forum that's
the thing and uh the RP hypertrophy app
it's coming unless it's already here
Scott when are we releasing this video
the app will be out I hope you're
enjoying the app oh that's what I was
gonna say see you later
