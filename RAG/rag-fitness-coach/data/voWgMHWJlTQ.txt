An interesting study by Ebben et al. experimentally
calculated how much weight you press during
different push-up variations.
What they found was during a regular push-up,
subjects pressed roughly 64% of their body
weight.
Elevating the feet increases this percentage.
A 30cm feet elevation has you press roughly
70% of your body weight, while a 60cm feet
elevation had you press roughly 74% of your
body weight
Opposingly, elevating your hands decreases
the percentage pressed.
a 30cm hand elevation had you press roughly
55% of your body weight, while a 60cm hand
elevation has you press roughly 41% of your
body weight.
They also looked at kneeling push-ups, these
had you press roughly 49% of your body weight.
