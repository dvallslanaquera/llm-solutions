what Sam is doing here is what I would
just call colloquially moving weight
around it's fun to be young and jacked
and strong as fuck and just like Bully
the weights it's dope and it's effective
too but the ratio of stimulus to fatigue
and the ratio of stimulus to injury
probability isn't ideal not so close to
Ideal this is good it's okay but it can
be done better by milking that slow
Ecentric controlling the weight at all
times and a big stretch maybe even hold
for a second let your lats really tear
apart at the top and then crunch down
totally good to do that powerfully and
explosively that's awesome you got a lot
of fucking energy in the gym great
