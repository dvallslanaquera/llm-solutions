I saw your video on Sam suck homeboy
very strong lifting full stack all the
rest of it but he's made of rubber and
Magic he's 22 or something yes we were
all made of rubber and Magic back then
yeah in my case it was a type of rubber
that wasn't able to get
erect huh oh I'm on set again when
you were young I get it I get it
if I can do this the over
there seeing you do it you're getting
late whatever ego live your life
when you're older and this is like a
particular pet peeve of mine I see like
a balding 48-year-old man
swinging the dumbbells around
but come here dumb how old
are you if I see an older you see a
younger guy swinging weights around like
whatever to be 20 again my man I see a
40-year-old doing it I'm like dude come
on it's like seeing a 45-year-old like
just after watching Fast INF Furious 18
or whatever like rev his up against
a younger guy and what the the
really this is what we're doing so it's
always good for everyone but for older
people just have no excuse slow
your down control your
