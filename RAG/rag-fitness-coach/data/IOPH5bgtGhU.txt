hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization rp
plus hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture
21 phase potentiation of volume
fancy this lecture actually answers a
ton of questions we get on youtube
instagram facebook all the other social
media outlets
about mev mrv how they change over the
course of multiple blocks and when it is
a good idea
to really pay attention to make sure we
are not off course so
we're going to talk about face
potentiation just a general review so
we're going to talk about how
minimum effective volume tends to trend
over the
course of multiple mesocycles in a row
over the training block
we're going to talk about how mrv trends
over the course of a training block
and we're going to talk about the
problems that arise when those two get
really really close to each other as you
can suspect maybe not the greatest thing
we're going to talk about why then a
maintenance phase might be a good idea
we're going to talk about what that
implies for the block design
and some quirks of how to alter these
things during fat loss dieting
to make sure that all of them still
apply and nothing gets really really
quirky so
phase potentiation really simple uh
principle of training
each phase has its own goals as it
always does but phase potentiation
realizes that each phase also has to set
up the next phase
most beneficially right to continue the
stupid food analogies
face potentiation is seen in a variety
of things not just
in sport periodization it's seen in
restaurant menu design
appetizers are in notoriously at
least i don't know i don't go to any
fine dining places but i've been told
that
fine dining establishments the size of
the appetizer is very important
because appetizers are fucking delicious
right you always want more of them
but if you eat too much of an appetizer
that's awesome
but then your dinner shows up and you're
like uh i like can i take this in a
to-go bag or eat some of it or the
the actual experience of flavor isn't as
awesome the point of the appetizer
appetizers twofold
to be amazing by itself and to make you
a little bit hungrier and excited
for the main course and the way they
pick the appetizer and main course
often times complementary so if the
appetizer is awesome
but also sets you up best for enjoying
the main course you guys ever finished
one kind of food like man you know what
we gotta kill for right now is this
other thing like you know like
pregnant women do like pickles and ice
cream or something like that right
as soon as you eat just to eat a normal
dinner food right
a lot of times that makes you want
dessert more than before you start
eating
that's a type of potentiation where
someone say okay mac and cheese with
ground beef
and then chocolate cake whereas if you
flip the order it might be like you know
after a piece of chocolate cake are you
ever like man you know what really go
for is mac and cheese or the house does
that but it's really rare
right that if you eat mac and cheese
first you may be able to really get a
lot out of chocolate cake that you
wouldn't normally
same idea for training potentiation so
any time we do a mouth cycle of training
we have two concerns not one the obvious
concern is is this metacycle producing a
good hypertrophic stimulus of course
that's always the number one concern but
a number two concern which we can't just
completely diffuse
has to be okay but how does this
training phase now
set up our next training phase is it
going to be
you know a disaster it's kind of like
before going on a trip
do you want to clean up your room and
clean up your house or apartment
uh you know you think like what the fuck
am i doing that for i'm gonna be on a
trip there's no purpose for my house to
be clean
i'm going to be away but hold on when
you come back from the trip you're
stressed out you've been flying you
can't wait to be home
do you want to come home to a nasty
dirty house or a super clean house it
feels so fucking amazing to come home
and everything's clean you're like oh my
god i can just relax this is great
versus coming home and there's like
flies and shit maybe not that bad right
there's clothes everywhere and you're
like
can't find the remote to relax like this
sucks being home sucks
that's another classic example of not
just being concerned
what happens now but being concerned of
how now affects later in preparing for
it so each phase is not a standalone
but the entire structure is a distinct
sequence of events
one making sure to take care of its own
needs and prepare the next one so how
does this apply
to volume in hypertrophy training here's
the deal
minimum effective volume goes up every
week or every few weeks
absolutely okay as you expose the body
to more stimulus it gets more and more
resistant to that stimulus and you need
more and more
to keep making even minimum gains right
over a mesocycle it goes up
substantially
but it is reduced considerably during a
de-load one of the main functions of a
d-load however it is not reduced
completely
so what ends up happening is over
multiple mesos you know accumulation
dealer accumulation dealer accumulation
deload
the mev can actually start to trend
upwards especially
for a distinct uh group of exercises in
a distinct repetition range like for
example squats in the 5 to 10 range
the mev for that how many sets you have
to do to get some quad growth
is going to go up meso tomazo to meso
for example
and this is a good just theoretical
example this is not a hard rule for sure
but if you've gotten this far in
hypertrophy concepts and tools you know
for sure that's not a hard rule maybe
your mev is 10 cents on the first mezzo
12 sets in the second 14 in the third
and the fourth meso 16 notice
before we move on a 16 set mev per week
but that's getting up there compared to
10
just by itself it may be something we
want to address sooner or later we can't
keep going like this right
what about mrv well mrv
during a meza cycle for for the first
few weeks it actually goes up because
your work capacity expands
right you start doing squats in the 5 to
10 range they're a little bit novel if
you just did
max squats in one week you wouldn't be
able to do that many when you shift the
bed
right because you're not very efficient
at the movement and you're not really
ready to recover from the movement so on
and so forth but as you do more and more
squatting weeks to week to week
your mrv actually goes up your maximum
recovery volume your ability to recover
from the
for the most volume you can goes up
because you get more used to the
exercise your work capacity goes up
your efficiency goes up and so on and so
on so on those are all good things
however towards the middle and end of
the meso it starts to flatline
and decline why because cumulative
fatigue cuts it like crazy and it's
going up exponentially
right so at first it goes up and then
it's just a flat line and then it comes
down
good news because when it comes down
it's really easy to detect that's when
you know how to deload awesome
during a deload you drop fatigue like
crazy
so the mrv rises significantly again
at the beginning of the next meso but
not all the way because some cumulative
fatigue
continues to hang in there over the
course and start sort of grows over the
course of multiple measures because
remember
deload brings down most fatigue but not
all fatigue
so in a block
of let's say four mesocycles mrv
probably climbs for the first one or two
mesos because again your work capacity
efficiency improvements are so awesome
then it probably flat lines towards the
third meso in many cases and then
begins to decline right so we have a
situation here here's an example your
mrv might be 20 sets
per week of some exercise and the first
mezzo on the second it might be 22
then it goes back down to 20 still good
training no worries in the third and
then it goes
down to 18 even lower than it was in the
first one
on a fourth measurement think about it
fourth fucking meso of
grinding hypertrophy training it's not
really a surprise the rmrv is lower than
it used to be multiple messes ago when
you were completely fresh
right so how is this a problem well
here's the big problem take a look at
that red box really quick
after about four mesocycles just an
example happens for some people at three
happens for some at six seven or eight
measles of of consistent training
we have a big problem here our mev
example went from
in measure one ten to twelve to fourteen
to sixteen
okay and our energy example went 2022
2018.
take a look forget about the red box for
a second i'm just mindfucking you now
look at the first month the first
mesocycle of training for both amyv and
mrv
10 and 20. that's a big ass range you
start at roughly 10 sets you go all the
way to 20 sets you deload that's a whole
lot of weeks of incrementally raising
volume and getting amazing amazing gains
that's a ton of time spent
around the maximum adaptive volume what
about in the last
block and this could be worse or sorry
the last mesocycle
starts with 16 and goes to 18. what does
that mean you raise sets for two weeks
and then you're done
that's terrible that might mean that you
have to raise a set only once every
other week which could
not lead to maximized responses in
either way you cut it
either you're not stimulating a whole
lot more growth between weeks
or you do a fewer weeks which is to say
your
actual training mesocycle the fourth one
is
just not very hypertrophic okay you
arrive fucked up
and you get fucked up faster than usual
past the point of where you can recover
right and you may have experienced this
before advanced and intermediate
trainees will know like starting a
fourth or fifth mesocycle when you
should have like cut your mass phase and
done a maintenance already
and like week one you're like oh how
many more weeks of this shit do i have
to do whereas like
the first one or two as was week one
you're like i can't wait to do eight
fucking weeks of accumulation
so it's a big deal it's an obvious
obvious problem
and the problem is that the average
volumes get very very high
but the stimulus sensitivity is very
very low as noted by the super high
minimum effective volume
cumulative fatigue is very high as noted
by the super high mrv right to start
with
that is not an ideal training situation
if you choose to do
another mesocycle of training you're
essentially saying okay i know
that the amount of stimulus i get is
gonna suck and i have to work like
crazy to get a decent stimulus but hold
on
your ability to work like crazy
consistently sucks because your maximum
recovery volume is so low because your
cumulative fatigue is so high
it's the worst of all worlds it's like
working
on a group project at school or for a
corporate job you're working on some
kind of proposal a presentation
and you have like two days to get it
done you got 10 or 12 hours of great
work in one day
and now you have like a really
conceptually difficult problem that you
have to tackle in order to finish the
last several hours of work do you stay
late that night to finish it
there's a good argument for no because
you're already super fucking tired so
really difficult conceptual problems
you interest might be staining your
co-workers like looking at the stuff
charting all the data and be like i
don't know what the fuck we're doing
here anymore
i don't remember last time i slept i've
had one too many monsters where my brain
is just buzzing and nothing's going on
right so the amount of effort you have
to put into solving this task is very
high
but your preparedness for it is very low
fuck that it might be time
to cut off the day go home get some
food get some sleep come back early to
the office the next day
recharged blow that project out of the
water
and then four hours later toke up with
your homies as you know the
designated person goes to submit the
files to the boss right
that might be a better idea than just
cranking all the way through
so in enters the maintenance phase of
hypertrophy training
here's the thing an active rest phase of
roughly two weeks can reduce a ton of
fatigue and
many times it is the right idea to do
after a whole block of training
when you hit that last muscle cycle
that's very grotesquely inefficient
right or has a low stimulus to fatigue
ratio
however often not always
psychological fatigue is up there like
if you've been grinding for eight months
two weeks away from hard training might
not cut it
you might come back after two weeks and
be like fuck this i'm like allergic to
the gym you see a dumbbell press you're
like no no
no get me the hell out of here right
like that's how messed up your
psychologically it happens
when you train super hard connective
tissue fatigue might take
longer than two or three weeks to really
come down you may need a longer break
and many of the best
bodybuilders in the world take way
longer breaks
so in addition to that some volume
sensitivity may take a little longer
than two or three weeks to reduce
possibly
so we have to maybe step away for a
little bit longer
we have to conserve muscle so we can't
just leave the gym all together
but we have to do that by training as
low of a volume as we can
for probably about a mesocycle to bring
fatigue of all kinds psychological
connective tissue and so on
super super low arguably as low as it's
ever been in your career minus
wear and tear that you can't prevent and
to really sensitize for training volume
so that you get the most on a technical
level
from another accumulation phase later
right that's exactly what a maintenance
phase
is and how do you pick the exerciser for
this thing well
it depends on how much joint connective
tissue fatigue you bring in
because people say well hey maintenance
phase i want to use it to get a little
stronger because it's normally low
volume is that a good idea maybe
unless your hips and knees are so fucked
up that
doing lunges is fine but doing heavy
squats just isn't going to work
so if you are really really messed up
choose exercises that have a lower joint
and connective tissue impact than others
for example some bodybuilders after a
really big mass phase
before the pre-contest diet when they
take their down time
they'll use exercises like a lot of
cables a lot of machines
not a ton of weight not a ton of reps
just kind of moving some blood through
and getting some good
uh sort of anti-catabolic stimulus going
where you think like
why don't you just be more efficient if
you just did barbell incline press like
well my
shoulders elbows are so fucked up from
six months of awesome massing training
i just can't do that it's just not gonna
work right
so i have to use intentionally easy
exercises i myself have done this before
right
deadlifts and bent rows is not always
the time for them and sometimes you're
in a maintenance phase
because muscle maintenance is so easy if
you do cable
rows and you do some you know
stiff-legged deadlifts and pretty light
ones you can maintain
all that muscle you earn deadlifting and
bent over rowing but really let
everything heal especially joints and
conductive tissues which could be
irritated
right on the other hand if your joints
connective tissues feel fine but your
psychological fatigue is high
and your volume sensitivity is low you
can absolutely use the hardcore heavy
basics no problem at all
ideally you want the reps in the lower
ranges you want to keep the metabolites
low you want to get very not close to
failure
because you just want to minimize the
total amount of fatigue that is being
incurred you're not there to train hard
you are there to train easy just barely
hanging on to your gains
but letting the resensitization wave
come up super super high
volumes are going to be at maintenance
volume which often our little heuristic
we use here
is a third of your maximum adaptive
volume so for example
if we go back that first mesocycle
uh that we talked about uh on an mev of
10 and an mrv of 20
that means the mav average is roughly 15
sets per week that means for every week
on average of the maintenance phase
following this block
you do one third of 15 five working sets
per muscle group for this example
that yes that does mean you do three
sets of squats on monday
and two sets of leg presses on thursday
and that's
it for a whole mesocycle month month and
a half of training
the bad news you will grow zero muscle
doing that the good news you won't lose
any muscle
and your volume sensitivity your
connective tissue fatigue etc etc etc
are going to come
crashing down or by volume of
sensitivity volume resistance comes
crashing down
sensitivity comes up all of a sudden you
are in an absolutely excellent place
to do as good of a job as you can right
what this results in is a certain kind
of block design
a typical training block thus will spend
one to three measures on accumulation
four plus mesos is definitely possible
but for intermediates in advance that's
much
more rare because they just won't be
able to last that long their mrvs
are already being capped by their super
strength
and they're getting close to their
genetic limits so their rvs aren't crazy
high
but their mev has over the career come
up
so for them if they do five mezzos in a
row they may
cross mevs and mrvs altogether whereas
for beginners
five messes in a row they still have a
pretty good separator between the two
right
one measure of maintenance is usually
good enough three to four weeks of
maintenance in that phase is usually
good enough for most people but err on
the side of more
it's super tempting to be like three to
four weeks
you know i'm gonna do two and a half and
i'm fucking ready to go
if you were wrong and it turned out that
you didn't
drop all the fatigue you needed to you
didn't resensitize all you needed to
halfway through or two-thirds through
your next block your next macro cycle
you're gonna realize you need to screw
up your whole training plan to take more
time off
that sucks whereas if you air a little
bit on the side of more
you for sure clear all the space and
you're really almost no downside because
what the hell
is another week and a half in the grand
scheme and i'll tell you it's
nothing there's no rush there's a rush
to do it right
not a rush to do it as fast as humanly
possible because that almost hears you
all the time it's like this if you're on
a road trip and you're going through
like the american west
and there's a gas station every like 200
miles or something like that
uh you know when you get to a gas
station do you go pretty close to full
tank or are you like oh you know that
road sign says that gas station's 150
i'll just do half a tank like yeah or
that gas station is closed
or it's a fucking old sign hills have
eyes type shit nevada who the hell knows
if the aliens didn't put that sign up
right
are you really gonna bank get stuck in
the nevada desert because you were like
oh well
one and a half's good enough that's the
same thing of rushing your maintenance
right like you're filling up the car and
the friends are in the car right in
there come on let's go man we gotta get
to california you're like ah fuck this
i'm not gonna fill up the car i just
gotta have fun with my friends
uh maybe just fill it up and hey look if
there's a gas station 150 miles away
sweet you're like
how much did you really lose literally
30 seconds
of doing this and filling the gas pump
same thing a week extra week week and a
half of maintenance just to really
settle in
costs you know muscle and if anything it
heals joint connective tissue fatigue
and psychological fatigue so much
it might make your overall career longer
right
and then you repeat this sort of
template based on your situation needs i
will say
not the last thing is we have one more
slide but most of the best ifbb
professional bodybuilders
they do a lot of shit wrong and fucking
weird for sure but this is one thing a
lot of them have
really really right almost all the best
pros
take a nice one to two month maintenance
period
once or twice in a competitive year
okay at least once ronnie coleman was
notorious for after he finished the
olympia
and the european tour after he took like
one to
three months of just recreationally
training
eating high protein foods not really
tracking anything and doing
hardly any hardcore training at all
everything would heal everything would
come down
and then he would start his offseason
run up and start really pushing for the
olympia which would fucking win eight
years in a row
i've been in the sport long enough as a
shitty mostly person who watches the
sport and a
shittier competitor to see that people
that push it
show after show after show cut cycle
boom mass cut mass cut mass no
maintenance
they tend to burn out much more and they
don't last into the 30s and 40s and
really really
make as much of a mark as they could
have made on the sports give that some
thought
now lastly how does this change during
fat loss dieting well
mev goes up faster right because you
have a ton
of catabolism going on and you need to
counteract that with further increments
of mev fatigue goes up faster also
raising mev and of course
mrv will fall probably the entire time
right
i mean mmv doesn't fall as fast as you
would think because fibers convert to
slower twitch and your work capacity
improves real fast if you lose body fat
so mrv doesn't like go like this during
a fat loss phase but it will
go like that right so this is a problem
because if you just run your normal
progression of adding volume
you know but a certain sequence you're
going to do like a three week
accumulation
in a mesocyclone and just ship the bed
so what you might want to do
is use a little bit less volume addition
every mesocycle
this lengthens the meso and allows
longer blocks to be used
actually getting you to your goal you'll
notice a problem automatically say well
hold up
mike isn't don't we add volume by pure
auto regulation
perceiving the stimulus to fatigue ratio
and perceiving how disruptive the
exercise is
and if we're recovering and if on time
don't we just add more volume yes to
stay at mav
but to stay above minimum effective
volume you actually can take a much
less proactive approach and say okay
ideally i would add two sets to this
i'm just going to add one because i know
if i add two i'll have a great workout
this week but the next week i'll have
exceeded my mrv
so by definition if we use this sort of
less incremental addition of volume
violating the set progression algorithm
or sort of tampering it down a little
bit
what we end up doing is yes we're
training off mav training it's not the
best training you could get
but it's above minimum factor volume or
above maintenance volume for sure so
we're not losing any muscle
and we get to do high quality training
for longer which means
we get to keep our muscle while burning
fat for longer because you have to
deload
every third week that really fucks up
your training and you have to take diet
breaks every deload which is a very good
idea you don't diet through deloads
because it obviously the entire purpose
of a deload
you lose muscle and you don't drop
fatigue so you know if you have to deal
with super often it screws up your
momentum and it screws up the efficiency
of your cut
but if you manage instead of doing this
to your volumes doing this
in every single metacycle you still
accomplish all of your goals you still
have maintained all of your muscle
possibly gain a little bit but you get
these long stretches of time to really
apply your diet and really really get
lean right
so still the same phase potentiated
structure here but
maybe in a deficit two mesocycles back
to back is ideal not three
or maybe three and not four a lot of
times you'll be able to have more mesos
or longer mesos
when you're gaining weight or
maintaining it than if you are losing it
this is obvious stuff
uh when you've thought about it for a
while but i used to make this mistake
all the time like i'm gonna do like a
five block cutting phase and after block
or sorry five meso cutting phase and
after
measure number four i'm like i can't my
mrv is two sets higher per week than my
mev this is stupid right not not really
a good idea
in the end make sure you pay attention
to fatigue dynamics to stimulus dynamics
specifically at the end of each mezzo
ask yourself honestly
are you really good to go for efficient
effective stimulus to fatigue ratio
or high stimulus fatigue ratio training
in another mezzo and there's no ego in
this
at all you can honestly tell yourself
after an accumulation phase
man i need a break there's nothing wrong
with that at all take your d
load take a maintenance phase or an
active rest and then you'll be golden
for multiple moral messengers
there are no trophies and no awards for
being like i feel like ship
fuck that the process goes on why
why just do the right thing back away
when you have to of course work hard
but remember if i have to tell you to
work hard you don't need to be watching
this
you need to be watching videos that yell
at you and tell you to work hard or
something maybe videos can't help you so
hard work is an underlying foundation of
everything on top of that work smart
back off when you have to be honest
about how good your how high quality
of training you're getting folks thank
you so much for tuning in see you next
time
for lecture 22.
