hey folks
dr mike here from renaissance
puristation with charlie jung also of
renaissance production
we are going to demo the extension slash
push down for triceps
same idea we're going to talk about what
not to do
how to fix and what to do remember the
target for the tricep push down
is well the triceps but because of the
positioning it doesn't target the long
head as much
people seem to be obsessed with the
triceps long head that's much better
targeted
when you do extensions overhead and
actually when you do any kind of pulling
movements
this targets the other two tricep heads
no big deal those also need to grow
let's get to fixing the tricep extension
and making sure you are jacked
all right folks mistake number one super
common is a partial range of motion for
tricep push downs
happens all the time because you can use
more weight this way and feel proud of
yourself
unfortunately it's unlikely to get you
the best tricep growth so we want you to
do a full range of motion instead which
can be humbling
but is probably much more effective
charlie give us a demonstration of what
bro science partial rom looks like okay
we're going to be doing somewhere in the
mid-range there
no lockouts not coming all the way up
it's fun you can use a lot of weight
maybe not the best idea
and then show us what full range looks
like going to coming all the way up
and all the way down for a lockout
actually using the tricep through a full
range of motion
we're not going to be hercules lifting
all the weights but we're going to be
getting more hypertrophy
next mistake is thinking there's one
exact correct way to do push-downs where
they're actually three
and you could use any one of the three
sort of in a phasic manner where you use
one of them for a couple of mesocycles
then it gets a little stale and you use
another one and so on and so forth let's
take a look at the three
no right answers here it's just three
different options and a lot of times it
comes down
to which one you feel the most and is
easiest on your joints
so charlie show us the first variant
it's when we allow our elbows to track
forward
and we come up a little bit higher so
you notice the elbows come forward in
this
now people will say this is wrong but
they would be wrong themselves because
now we're actually using a little bit of
long head and we're getting a really
really great stretch
through the bottom part of the tricep
awesome another way to do
the tricep extension is to keep the
elbows completely locked and
only move the forearms totally fine
great
allows us to be super strict no problem
sometimes people experience some elbow
discomfort doing this
so what they can do is actually allow
their elbow to track back on the way up
and now it's more of a push down rather
than the other two which is more of a
tricep extension
you can use any one of these so long as
when you begin your set
you know which one you're using so you
can count reps appropriately
all of them are fine they're essentially
three versions of an exercise
similar to like a wider stance squat a
medium stance squat and a narrow stance
squat there's no correct answer of which
one hits your quads
all of them hit your quads pick the one
which feels best for your quads
and the best for your knees and hips
that's the one that's right for you and
feel free to use the others
when the time comes up same thing with
the tropics tricep extension you can
move your elbows forward just know that
you're doing it you can keep your elbows
locked know that you're doing it and you
can move your elbows back
all of them are 100 fine
next mistake is not having a standard
range of motion for every single
repetition
you have to be able to ensure a standard
range of motion so you can count
to make sure you're doing the same
amount of stimulus every time and being
able to expand it
and also to track performance if your
reps look different every week how do
you know your performance went up maybe
you just cut your
range this week who knows right so every
rep should look pretty much the same
pick a technique and stick to it and go
through the full range of motion so
the bad way of doing this charlie bro it
out you know
do this and sometimes do some short
wraps and sometimes the elbows come back
and sometimes we do that when we feel
like it i've literally seen people do
all of these in one set
who knows what they're doing the right
way to do it is to pick technique
which one you want charlie okay we're
letting the elbows come forward
awesome notice they're coming forward
the same way every single time
he's going all the way to full lock at
every single time and all the way back
up until his biceps touch his forearms
that's it
super common mistake on pretty much
every hypertrophy exercise
not controlling the eccentric the good
thing about not controlling the
eccentric or the descent
is that you get to feel better about
yourself because you get to do more reps
and use more weight the bad thing is it
causes less muscle growth so when we're
on the tricep extension
we're going to make sure to milk out the
eccentric that doesn't mean you have to
do it for five seconds
though that is a viable option but at
least gee one or two seconds
actively controlling the movement
charlie mess this up for us and show us
how to do it bro style with no control
boom and boom we're not trying to do the
eccentric that is hard
what about doing it correctly comes down
and we control
and comes down and we control charlie
show us a slow version of the eccentric
so this would be something like a three
or four second eccentric it's just
another way of doing things
control is the most important part how
fast you go
very secondary next mistake
is confusion about the lockout should
you be locking out your elbows or not
some folks will say the lockout is a big
part of what the tricep does you want
that peak tension and squeeze
some folks will say that that removes
the constant tension element and it
doesn't let metabolites sum up as much
both folks have their point the thing is
it's just two correct ways
of doing an exercise know which one
you're doing and
only do that for a time especially in
one session so if you choose to lock out
the elbows
make sure that you really milk and lock
out for a split second at the bottom
charlie show us how that works
so he's gonna lock it out squeeze and
then come back up he's gonna lock it out
squeeze and come back up and then the
other version is going almost to lockout
still full range of motion
but not quite locked out keeping the
tension on the muscles the entire time
both are totally cool we can actually
mix these two methods together
by doing a few reps without a lockout
and then when our triceps get really
tired we can lock it out rest for a
second
and then get back to work so he's gonna
lock it out and rest and then he's gonna
go again
and do almost locked out reps until that
happens again just know how many
intervals you're doing so you can plan
ahead for next week next mistake
very common is to flare the elbows by
flaring out your elbows
you get to use your lats actually and
your chest to help you press the weight
down
that's so sweet because you get to use
more weight but unfortunately triceps
actually get less of a stimulus
and the fatigue to the other muscle
groups and the rest of your body goes up
for no reason so
charlie bro it out for us do some tricep
presses
yeah sweet that's like a weird decline
bench press
now you'll see some very high level pros
doing this the reason they do it is
because their lats and triceps are so
big
they can't actually get their elbows any
closer what we want you to do is not be
completely in line because that may not
be possible for you if you're actually
jacked
just get your elbows as close to your
sides as you can and don't willfully
press the bar down
extend the bar down using your triceps
charlie show us what that looks like
so we're actually going to keep our
elbows as close together as we can
and do proper extensions very good
what about where to put your shoulders
okay a lot of folks say there's this
completely proper place to do it it
turns out there are a couple correct
answers
pretty much only one correct answer for
super super strong people
but we'll get to that in a second so
fundamentally there are sort of four
poles in this one is doing tricep
extensions with your shoulders
protracted
so charlie's going to put his shoulders
forward completely yep
and then he's going to do tricep
extensions like that totally fine way to
do them
the opposite is retracting the shoulders
so he's going to retract her shoulders
and do tricep extensions
totally fine way to do them he can also
elevate his shoulders
he's basically shrugging up and he's
going to do his extensions that way
and also he can depress his shoulders if
he wants and do
his tricep extensions that way
everything's super cool here's the deal
when you get super strong the position
that you get
put into just by default because it's
really heavy weight
is going to be a retracted position that
is elevated
almost everyone's strong does their
tricep extensions from this position
because they would have to good enough
charlie they would have to fight the
weight
down to depress it and actually
you know protract the scapulae that
would require extra effort from muscles
that are not the triceps and are not the
target
and take the brain away from focusing on
getting the best tricep workouts so
fundamentally the answer is wherever you
feel comfortable and you can really
focus on your triceps
don't you worry about what your
shoulders and scapulas are doing now on
the other hand
if you really feel the triceps more when
you protract and you have no problem
depressing and still focusing on the
tricep
go to town but as you get stronger you
may find that this position
defaults to being the one that feels
best
next mistake is standing too far away
from the machine or too close to the
machine
if you stand too far away from the
machine you can start to feel it less in
your triceps and more in your lats
as the machine pulls you away and you
actually get a lot of lat activation
and rear delt stuff and it turns out
that that might not be the greatest
thing for you to focus on your triceps
another problem is if you stand really
close to the machine you might just be
super awkward
and you might i'll be sort of scratching
your face with the machine it doesn't
work super well
the ideal position is something you have
to determine just by feel
start off oh about six inches to a foot
away from where the cable is
and give that a shot you'll be able to
tell where you feel best
and that's really the correct answer
there is no 100 right answer
to how far how close to stand next to
the machine also
you don't have to make sure to press in
a straight line
there is no rule in any book that says
that's a good idea
arcing is totally fine charlie try to
press in a straight line to make sure
that the bar only travels straight
yeah you end up kind of having to push
the bar out at the end and take a weird
body angle
that's totally fine but if you do a
regular tricep extension it's going to
arc into you
nothing wrong with that so don't
perseverate on the crazy details
just do a good job stimulating the
muscle
the next concern is thinking that there
is an
optimal push down bar or some kind of
attachment
or hand position that is pure nonsense
you have to go by what stimulates the
muscle the most you feel the most
tension in the triceps you feel the most
burn in the triceps
you get the most pump in the triceps and
your triceps get super weak and tired
directly there and super messed up after
training and potentially sore
if that happens that's a really great
thing and if your elbows and shoulders
and forearms and wrists feel good
then you have picked a very effective
variant and there are very many of them
and it's okay to have your favorites for
example people ask
should i do tricep extensions with a
wide grip should i do tricep extensions
with a close grip
should i do it underhand should i do it
even with this attachment at all
maybe i can do a rope all of them are
100 fine as long
as your joints feel good and your
muscles are being targeted if someone
says listen
close grip's the only way to go and
you're doing tricep extensions
and it hurts the crap out of your
shoulders and it beats up your elbows
you're like
i guess the right way to go it's just
going to hurt me fine
that is total bs if you're super weird
for whatever reason
you actually feel your triceps the best
out here
and it happens to really just not bother
your elbows or shoulders at
all 100 do it for example
you guys know the v handle i don't ever
do the v handle because the v handle
hurts either my wrists or my elbows or
my shoulders or i can't do a full range
of motion
but a ton of people swear by the
v-handle they love it not a damn thing
wrong with that
do what works for you and feel free to
explore
the last mistake in tricep push-downs
isn't a huge mistake but it can get in
the way of effective training
it's going too heavy sets of 5 to 10
reps
to stimulate the really fastest twitch
fibers is a great way to grow your
triceps it just so happens
that the push down is probably not ideal
for that if you're remotely strong
enough
you start getting into the problem of if
you do that much weight you're actually
getting thrown off balance and being
picked up by the device
it's just not tenable in addition to
that you have
all these variations of tricep
extensions and tricep presses
and dips and close grip presses and jms
and skulls
you can use a bunch of those for sets of
five to ten no problem
and you can save things like the push
downs for the higher reps that are
really impossible or just not very
effective
with a lot of those other exercises so
my personal recommendation to you
is to save tricep push downs and
extensions four sets
of 10 to 20 reps or even sets of 20 to
30 reps are awesome and feel free
to metabolize technique the crap out of
this exercise
mile reps drop sets occlusion training
even works for triceps
and super sets are excellent so you do a
set of 25
almost a failure push downs and
immediately you drop down and do as many
close grip push-ups as you can
voila perfect your triceps will scream
at you in a very loving way
that actually tells you they're growing
