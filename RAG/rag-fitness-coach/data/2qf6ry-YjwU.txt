so all the guys that are
fading because they were pumping up for
35 minutes before uh you're gonna be
getting sharper it's i it's every
fucking time every time i'll see guys my
guys get moved to the they're here and
then the guy in the middle fades my guy
goes there you go you win
congratulations mario style on top yeah
just literally jumps over everybody and
he's a turtle turns into turtle shell
explodes and that's it the guy dies
right there on stage that better be like
the
first thing scott the video guy puts
into the this better be the first thing
we talk about
hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization with
rp's head
of the competitive physique division
jared feather ifbb pro
and he is
dying of some kind of
some kind of disease he looks real not
so well
but we got him to stay upright for long
enough weakened bernie style to answer
some
interesting questions and a chat a
little bit about
the natural peaking process
so i have a couple questions for you
[Music]
what are your general principles for a
natty peak you got an athlete coming in
how many uh folks uh have you worked
with maddie for their pro pro cards
quite a few uh peaked quite a few
natural pros themselves just for their
peak week process in general and then
also have turned quite a few people pro
naturally
also continued to work with them and
done ran their peaking processes
but basically you were a natural pro as
well and i was not to pro myself yeah so
i'm very familiar with the process of
peaking for a show so basically
for those who don't know
peaking is really just the
we're saying that we're trying to look
our best at a certain point in time
obviously that time is we want to be
peaked on stage our peak not performance
in this case but it's our peak physique
so that is somewhat of a combination of
three things
you could say it's to basically fill out
intramuscular uh glycogen storage
to reduce the total amount of
extracellular fluid that we may see in a
person so mostly subcutaneous
and then also to kind of keep their uh
waistline pretty sharp and not uh
overdue with the carbohydrates or food
the day before the contest or the day of
the contest so that way they can
actually kind of have a smaller
waistline they can pose on stage things
of that nature so that really is kind of
what a peaked physique really looks like
any other terms like conditioned dry
full um those are all things rainy
grainy people are pretty just basically
really saying this person looked really
good on stage and they looked peaked all
right so that's the peak what a peak is
how about just for a second
we go back and forth to each other at a
show complementing our oh i love
physique but like you better use some
interesting terms are we watching
they're they're like on the stage
we're coming
backstage you're like dude you're
looking fucking dice bro dude
thanks man i had like tilapia just like
for like five weeks yeah it was like so
skin
really stands it out man sends it out no
water under here man old school yeah
yeah you look uh
coach how many cars did you eat
yesterday fucking a thousand grand
thousands yesterday
today zero definitely get full maybe a
little flat across the chest slatter
crying knew it man my chest always
flattens out yeah maybe you get a new
coach yeah
[Music]
my coach is my dad and my best friend
same person damn that's sad and i'll
fire my name my dad
listen man this is your best friend
yeah fuck
listen uh
you're looking uh you're looking peeled
out man yeah man you have great includes
durations lines going all the way up the
back of your head
all the way up to you you know what you
got bro you got fucking 90s conditioning
fuck man
you're like 720p conditioning yeah yeah
you're like sean levrone
like chris coleman or one of those guys
about the 90s conditioning shit let's
save that for a second a few more a few
more okay you look um
it looks like you got some like your
density is really like high yeah man
yeah definitely you must look like
really heavy because you're pretty dense
too bro i'm telling you i'm telling
these new school cats
yeah and you're hard like i'm not that
hard hard they've got to be hard
it's like see you could be dancing it's
like there but it's like not hard
bro
you gotta go heaviest garage it's a
garage mentality
garage jam branch pig iron
slag iron
i don't even use machines i don't use
weights i use bricks pieces of like old
busted up trains
right yeah dorian did that too i think
dorian didn't even train he just yelled
i knew it that's how fucking hardcore he
was
you ever yelled a failure bro
maybe at a concert or something
all right now that we got that out of
the way
uh what do i do with my we'll just go
nutrient by neutral yeah protein how
does it change through the week of
peaking including into the show
oh whoa intake and source like i said
everybody knows what peaking is now so
uh i do want to add one more caveat here
peaking
is a process
that people get carried away with um if
you look really good a week out there's
not a ton of manipulation you should do
but i'm not one of those zealots that
also says just go into the show
uh peaking can definitely enhance the
appearance of your physique
i'm gonna quantify it obviously it's
hard to quantify by five percent going
into the show you can look five percent
better if you're extremely conditioned
and you are a flat natural competitor
from monday to saturday the show you can
look five percent better it's a thing
peaking is a thing
that being said
don't try a bunch of crazy shit and uh
ruin your physique uh leading into the
show you should have some practice peaks
through the prep and things of that
nature so
with that being said protein first uh
it's relatively consistent
some people do have
uh
gi distinction or bloating ish
from certain protein sources and because
of that i tend to lower the protein the
days of carbohydrate load because you're
going to be hypercaloric you're not
going to lose lean tissue in this
process you're actually probably going
to gain back some lost lean tissue
during the carbohydrate load so the
protein is reduced by like 25
uh just to keep
the gi kind of so like a gram per pound
just below that sort of right yeah all
right basically just goes down to normal
or slightly below normal
any special protein sources you like
people to stick with sources
through the prep that
they seem to agree with a lot of people
have make-believe scenarios in their
head where they're like i'm real bloated
with like this and that and i i don't
ever see it but i'm just to make them
happy it's like okay well then pull the
egg whites you don't like the egg whites
pull them out i feel like egg whites
gotta hurt me bro right you know you
hear shit like that all the time and
just to keep some competitors happy
sometimes they think they know better
than the coach or they they do like they
see these like placebo effects uh oh you
know just work with a client right if
they want just chicken that entire time
whatever have it what about doc
some of them like duck i've had clients
who like duck uh caviar oh god i don't
know my only protein source for peeking
is champagne
champagne i like to celebrate early baby
i'm already a winner
yeah i was proceeding champagne but
enough
carbs what do you do with carbs
throughout the week is there like a do
you do the depletion do you do the ramp
do you do the one or two day carb up
yeah so it really depends on the person
again i i mentioned that
if you're insanely conditioned
these things
can look make you look significantly
better if you're somebody who like is
doing a warm-up show or somebody who's
doing the first ever show and you're not
as conditioned as you could be um
less is almost more in every
circumstance a slight unless it's like
you know
maybe play with the water a little bit
uh people are generally you wake up
every morning in that stage of prep and
you're like oh new veins who knew this
knew that so generally
new vein to this so keeping their
carbohydrates and stuff like that
consistent and they're water consistent
is a good idea
but um the general outline for a natural
person would really just to be
uh try some form of a
quote-unquote depletion and during that
time if you were just completely
shredded to the bone you could also try
a triglyceride intramuscular
triglyceride storage
kind of ramp up if you would like so a
lot of coaches are starting to do that
as well and there's a really good
peaking paper by dr scott stevenson i
believe schoenfeld and alan aragon wrote
the forward on that and then there were
like chris bearcat was on it a bunch of
other guys that we all know really well
um they're not motherfuckers oh shit
before you guys i actually don't know
who chris barracad is i've heard the
name my whole life and he has a really
cool last name yeah he's just like two
hours i believe he's out of florida i
met him uh when marvin won his pro card
actually he's a good dude
but uh super nice um
but him and a bunch of other guys wrote
that paper out of florida i believe
scott stevenson uh very very in-depth
analysis of what you should do with all
this stuff so if you'd like more detail
you can go find that study it's free
it's online
but
really you can ramp up the fats just
basically taking your calories to
maintenance if you're already shredded
um and that is accompanied with a
decrease in carbohydrates to
somewhat ramp up and uh increase the
intramuscular tract or intramuscular
carbohydrate storage so basically like
if you can generally store and this is
uh just off the top of my head i believe
it's 23 grams per
kilogram of lean tissue that somebody
could store total body glycogen
um so 2300 grams of carbs
if somebody's 100 pound or 100 kilogram
male let's say for example
so the people who do like four day carve
ups with like a thousand grams of carbs
a piece kind of silly unless you're
training some of that off really hard
um but that does go up slightly if you
do a sort of depletion we see the
depletion of carbohydrates to a super
compensation increase you can store
slightly more than that and obviously
this is also biologically dependent so
not everybody is the same right 23 is an
average um
which is why practicing is smart
so
i generally tailor on the side of
caution and i i'm a little
on the smaller end of it so if you could
also break it down this way 10 to 15
grams per kilogram for the first day of
carb up let's say you do 15 grams for
the first day you see how they're
looking uh you can take that down a
little bit so i might do something like
13 and then 10. two-day carb up right i
generally keep it a two-day carb because
you're also bringing training down which
i'll talk about
you're not burning much off these
activities coming down things like that
so yeah carbohydrates are going to
decrease
beginning of the week uh with a ramp up
in water and potentially sodium
depending
and then an increase in carbohydrates
with a leveling off of the water and
sodium as you go into the show
so if a guys are already shredded
do you do carb depletion typically in
the early part of the week anyway or not
so much uh yeah i mean it depends on
what they were eating before so like
sometimes to get a natural guy really
shredded anyway he's already like 100
grams of carbs maybe i'll just keep them
there because by the time you're eating
a carb when you're that freaking lean uh
the actual mechanism in which you uptake
carbohydrates it's already like ready
it's like basically give me give me give
me right and the second you need a carb
it's it's getting stored so they're
already in that state in which they want
carbohydrates so there's no reason it's
going to go down to like 20 grams right
it's kind of silly it's like going and
then i've seen a lot of mishaps with
like going from keto to
eating carbohydrates again right away a
lot of people respond differently to
that process and
it might take a little bit of time to go
from that ketogenic state to wanting to
kind of store carbohydrates again so
it's like keep it kind of consistent
especially if they're super shredded and
they're already really low calorie
somebody can still lose a bit of fat and
they're like let's just say like 300
grams of carbs still you could
definitely take them down
to
minimal carbs a lot of people do trace
carbs when they're increasing the fats i
just kind of do minimal carbs i don't
try to put people in into that keto
state i don't really think there's any
benefit to it you don't like longevity
yeah keto diet baby
it'll make you immortal yeah that's what
i hear
uh so fat you said something about fat
loading has maybe a place yeah
potentially as a place just for the
intramuscular triglyceride storage what
do you typically like to have how many i
forgot about a 150-pound natty peak
competitor how much fat am i eating in
the week up to the peak including the
peak so if you're taking the carbs down
to that uh
trace amount that i like it'll not trace
but like the amount in which you're not
keto but it's pretty freaking low you're
just basically taking the fats up to
that making that person eat sound kind
of like a maintenance right above
maintenance pause
all week long for the last week is
maintenance ideally
yeah ideally for the last let's say
six seven days of the peak you're taking
that person
and you're putting them in that uh
decreased carb state
so they can super compensate later and
you're increasing the
fats to put them at the maintenance diet
because they are deloading with their
training and they're reducing activity
and all those things so if you're trying
to lose fat still and you're not
training hard then you have potential
for muscle loss and you gotta get it
back and it's just a big mess
okay i'll ask you a follow-up to that in
a bit
what happens with water
so water also is kind of a dependent
thing because
we're really really good at kind of uh
the intracellular extracellular fluid
compartments being a very one-to-one
ratio of what's being excreted
but when you do use water as a diuretic
you will
see
brief periods in time in which the
subcutaneous water is lesser than the
water elsewhere so it's like if you can
increase carbs at the same time as you
can bring that water down
um you get that full dry all that
bullshit me and mike said look that's a
friday night situation and that's more
of like a friday night thing so it's
really it's generally
either a slight elevation in their water
and there's you know anywhere from
people increasing all the way up to like
12 liters
lower than that depending on their size
depending on the sodium they're taking
in because you don't want to just
increase water i'll talk about that you
can you know there's all kinds of stuff
hyperkalemia hypoclinic kaleemia
hyponatremia hypernitrometer all kinds
of shit that can go wrong if you're not
playing with all this stuff
so i generally just say if you increase
your water sodium also has to increase a
little bit just so everybody knows and i
wouldn't play with potassium too much
except for having some additional
potassium in your carb of sources
but water can be increased by like 1.25
by the beginning of the week sodium can
come up in conjunction and then
about you know thursday friday at the
show is saturday you're decreasing the
water
such that it's back down to basically
the normal amounts so they're still
diuresing and the carbohydrates can pull
in the excess fluid because for every
gram of glycogen stored i believe it's
like they say two point they used to say
2.7 but i was like rat liver studies now
they say like three to four grams of
water for each gram carbohydrate my
coach has been weighing rat livers they
have
literal rat livers it's a long time to
harvest them probably a fine source of
protein
but i i can't imagine how many rats had
to die for you to eat
just rat livers rats die all the time in
the new york subways anyway they might
as well die for a grand purpose well
they're dying at whatever you weigh
times one
a lot yeah that sucks um okay wow you
busted through all those really so
towards friday night
water is down to a normal level not a
lot
sodium is down to the normal level as
well or a little less than that
slightly less generally
uh with that with that to increase
a lot of that kind of stays around and
then whenever the carbohydrates start
coming in it's pulling a lot of things
into the tissue things are being moved
around and you're kind of drying out a
little bit and you're going to notice
that too like even if you reduce your
water back down to normal if you're
eating a thousand grams of carbs you'll
actually start to get like that
cottonmouth which is crazy and you're
i'm drinking three liters of water still
why am i cotton mouth that's just like a
gallon
so i mean you're literally still
drinking a gallon of water but you're
taking in so many carbohydrates that is
pulling a lot of that into the tissue
and yeah you feel dehydrated which is
it's fine it's okay
you don't overdo the water then right
you know over doing it where you're not
taking it slowly a little thirsty yeah
wake up in your shredsville basically
and then what do you typically like to
have athletes eat before they step on
stage and like let's say i wake up at 8
a.m
for my touch-up tan and then i on stage
uh hopefully anywhere between 11 and 1.
so you're
you're kind of waking up and assessing
the physique and these things are okay
with natural competitors
again let's say this with enhanced
competitors is much harder and you kind
of have to stick with a plan and not try
to
do anything drastic at the last second
because these processes just like are
already in play and they're already they
have to play themselves out
with naturals it's a little different
i'm used to enhanced shit working like
this
i'm at the hotel wednesday through
saturday great i'm eating meals i'm
doing a lot of hotel lighting posing
because i envision myself in first place
do i do the quarter
[Music]
no stone left unturned i say that to
myself a lot
and then generally my coach wants
pictures of me completely naked
every five minutes it could coach
because he he really can make the
manipulations he sees the illustration
coming in and he goes how many grams of
carbs you just eat yeah 97 he's like cut
it to 95 throw up two grams of carbs
that's how i'm used to it now with
dedicated coaches they're there in the
hotel room with me watching me naked
that's very nice
pose sleep defecate shower defecate
again
good that's good that's a good coach
yeah well you know it's a it's a nice
gesture and i think that they think
they're doing something
for the client but uh
again these processes take time
in biology and they're already set in
motion especially if you did something
such as increase your water there's a
diuretic response that has to occur and
until it's done occurring nothing else
you do is gonna fucking matter so if you
increase your water and you do a sharp
drop off and then you're like oh no
scratch that we need more water well
you're still gonna continue to diurese
and then if you add that water back in
and you don't manipulate anything else
you might look watery yeah look like
shit because your body freaked out and
then it's like oh water we'll just hold
it yeah exactly 100 and i mean i've done
it to myself so it's not like it's
they're doing
anything bad but they're also probably
not doing anything except
causing excess stress for the client
because they're like hey i need pictures
now i need to do in two hours and you
begin it's just like
set the plan and play
kind of like again read that paper
uh practice a peek yourself
like three four weeks out maybe during
your your last deload before the peak
week
um
see how you do don't do anything drastic
and then you have a general outline set
by principles that you can follow and if
you do notice that things are kind of
like i'm a little flat even though last
time i had a thousand grams carbs from
that first day i woke up this time
because you're going to be leaner and
you're going to have less fat i woke up
this time and i'm like yeah i look a
little shittier so maybe that then you
can up your carbohydrates just a little
more on that second day of carbing up
but really those are the types of
manipulations you'd be making not like
every two hours okay well let's go to a
cup now now a half cup now a cup of rice
now a quarter of a couple rice that's
just it's like have something in play
there's a you can make your own little
algorithm there's a nice math played out
for you i've said a lot of numbers in
this little talk and you can even see
them listed again in the paper and other
places and
it works it's physiological so you like
to go by numbers absolutely what do you
think about this i like my car peak
because like once some carbs hit your
blood you feel
good yeah
and then i like to think i'm done with
numbers i'm just eating a lot of carbs
and i'm just going
i legit mean like the level that i'm at
i'm hanging out with trix rabbit and
captain crunch and motherfuckers both
for real in my room robot uh like the
captain the coco guy i don't like that
guy that'll be huge tony the tiger comes
through and you know tony got that
energy that's that that's that white on
white
tony always brings that white what the
hell you think frosting's made of
frosted flakes
in any case i don't even know sometimes
i miss the show because i'm partying so
hard with my boys
that's not a good way to pee i think
clients miss the show you thought
clients missed a show dylan
dylan missed the show
dylan's not something yeah she didn't
he didn't somebody missed it for him
yeah he was standing there on the side
like can i just go on stage so the story
is dylan went to a show and
he was pumping up and one of the ushers
was like hey this actually this hallway
is the hallway for pumping up and he's
like are you sure they're like yes i'm
an usher go
and he just stood there and pumped up
for a long time he's like gee whiz it's
been a while next time he checked the
show was like almost over yeah his class
is already on the stage and he walks
over there's only four guys besides him
and he's like can i just go out there
because they're like literally and
they're like mandatory poses and the guy
goes no
it's like what a dick
is that guy fired he should be
it makes the ipe look bad but
that's that's why we're here to talk
about shit that's a real opinion all
right
these opinions
are neutral as far as renaissance
periodization right i'm not going to say
nonsense organization doesn't agree with
jared or does agree because you know
sometimes companies are like we do we do
not you know what i'm saying these
aren't our opinions these might be our
opinions but maybe they're not maybe
maybe not all right but they are mine
training taper
i personally have the opinion but i go
hard every day
on friday night i'm at the gym trying to
put on a little bit more muscle and you
wake up flat every time i win every time
where are your trophies man with hashtag
win it's a mindset it's not really
winning oh so you beat your your
previous best
i'm an entrepreneur that's what some
people do they just go to beat the
previous best some people do that
he's an actor he's famous hollywood's
very true what do you know
do you like guys to train hard into a
show when do you pull the plug on
training and have them go to d-load
ideally so d-load should occur
at six seven days out uh you start the
dealer process you can still have one
two heart sets per body part those first
couple of days um ideally you're not
causing much muscle damage because
muscle damage can actually inhibit the
uptake of glycogen um so don't be sore
don't be sore yeah if you're sore friday
and you're trying to get your chest to
fill out like you're gonna be tough
um
yeah so if you're in there going crazy
um
i've seen guys who felt like what their
issue was was they overdid it on the
carbs so they go to the gym and they
actually train hard which will make you
even more sore because now you have the
nutrients to cause even more damage and
you kind of feel it a little more
so a lot of guys they'll try to burn off
the extra glycogen because of that uh
really usually it's a sodium or water
issue when that happens because
it's hard to spill over via
carbohydrates if you're not eating
excessive sodium sources like i've
overdone the 23 gram per kilogram thing
before many like probably a few times
um
i remember eating
1500 and 1500 and then
uh the day of i even had like another
500 because it shows at night time so it
was quite a bit of carbohydrates um
but my water and sodium were tapered off
and it was kind of i was just getting
more and more cotton mouth and i was
like is this nationals uh nationals have
yeah definitely have it at nationals you
were dry as
fuck yeah i was very trying nationals
it was nice that was good you remember
you didn't know each other back then
yeah yeah i came up to you backstage i
was like bro blow your glutes dude
i'm not going to say no homo because i
don't mean that at all
you're driving
i was like thanks man here's my number
hit me up after the show because i don't
know him or not i don't do numbers i
only do snapchat oh shit i don't have
that app
nope we probably never hooked up
all right um
yeah so uh don't be sure
um the last day friday probably won't
train at all you can do some posing uh
just because you're gonna be eating a
lot of carbohydrates so you want to do a
little bit of something keep activity up
a tad uh don't stress about
having to walk around the hotel and shit
like it's fine we all have to do it
everybody's going to check-ins and
coming back to their room and doing
whatever so don't freak out because
you're not going to be like people like
put your feet up man just put them up
put them up it's like okay whatever dude
like you ate a bunch of fucking carbs
and you just reduced all the cortisol
that you had accumulated through that
the entire mesocycle before because you
had so much food you had a bunch of
water you're fucking feeling great so
don't stress about little shit like that
like it's not a big deal and the amount
of activity you're doing that day as
opposed to
a week ago the saturday before this
saturday when you were going fucking
hard doing an hour and a half of cardio
is very minimal and you're gonna be fine
so don't stress that's a big thing you
ready for a mind fuck mind fuck me dog
if you tell me not to stress about
little shit you'll stress and i start
stressing about am i stressing about
little shit it's a fucking closed loop i
fucking do that
how do you pull away
uh you take a fucking benadryl
and you go to sleep
what about like ten zannies or if you're
into the uh cannabis scene
there you go
about that
all right um
okay
ideally
let's say you got a guy coming in real
sharp do you want them to sort of relax
that last week diet wise and stay in
maintenance
or do you ever make the executive
decision to say monday tuesday wednesday
we're cutting you up cardio everything
get you that last little bit of fat loss
or is that last week last fat loss the
cortisol stress response is just not
worth it yeah it could it could
definitely be not worth it it could and
it could also take that guy who is super
sharp but could be a little more sharp
it could give them that last bit of fat
loss
um again especially when special sports
ups or in play let's say natty natty
only this video is called maddie peak
motherfuckers wants to talk about drugs
you know what makes nanny peak better
uh yeah no definitely
yeah you could take the first couple
days and try to lose a little bit more
fat but ideally you want to be in a
circumstance where you're pretty relaxed
um during the depletion i sometimes
don't do the
uh fat load so there will be a deficit
still for the first couple of days
and then they're coming up
um so yeah you could use that last
quarter of peak week to lose a little
bit of fat after that because you are
dealering again
around that time the d-load volume is
going down even more and you're doing
even less training so it's probably time
to go ahead and take them the calories
to maintenance and uh
reduce some stress super
and cardio down yeah i think second to
last
cardio has to go down
so wednesday time to cool the uh the
whole deal whatever monday tuesday maybe
you're burning wednesday you're you're
you're fucking saying like if you do end
up eating some carbohydrates like you're
like yeah we're looking good uh the fat
load doing pretty well and wednesday you
want to eat like you know a minor carb
up
that's it's probably fine in most
circumstances um i do like to
incorporate
a bit of like a moving around slash pump
up style of of training during like
wednesday thursday so they're just kind
of doing like two or three sets per body
part per week like six rio stimulates
glycogen exactly and i mean like i said
you're already in that state in which
that mechanism specifically to glute
mechanism it's it's already kind of
ready to push and shuttle these carbs
but doing some activity helps even more
and actually stimulates that process a
little bit better so doing some sort of
pump up uh workouts not a bad idea
i'm writing something down because i'm
about to ask you some shit
some shit
i'm ready for it okay
so the three things
one you wrote down three things just now
good job dude i wrote down two wait
i don't know
ashkenazi brain hey it likes the
ashkenazi brain does two things
incredibly well it makes you a fucking
genius and gives you radical anxiety i
don't even know where i am right now
ah second one sounds terrible it is
the gift and the curse so i got the
white trash like whatever you know
whatever you get a cigarette i'm fine
three mistakes in peaking naturals that
you see that grind your gears jared i
know you got gears and i know you should
have all rounded up because you're
pissed daily this one is going to be
i don't know if it's number one but it's
going to be something cool to add
because we just talked about supplements
people taking gdas
glucose disposal agents agents um things
of that nature like berberine and other
things like uh
all these companies have like slend is
literally the name of what's so funny
i'm just like jesus i'm drunk free bro i
think yes naturals want to do everything
possible to be not natural but just
claim their natty and be like prideful
it's insane
um
it's very irritating it's funny even
when i was a natural leadership person
here's my natty stack yeah you went out
i was natural i was like okay so you
take how many grams of creatine per week
okay cool competitive edition
um
so
one these
supplements are not studied well they've
not been around very long
and they could potentially be dangerous
they could potentially damage your liver
they could potentially do a lot of
things that we don't know
you're telling me my gda from psycho
labs
hasn't been empirically validated
correct
news to me yeah i'm correct
and some of them might actually have
some low low-level form of like
metformin in them or something and then
good luck to your nanny status baby
really my lab called imprisoned
physiques with a z
that's nicely lying to me right they
might be lying to you sponsored or not
baby
so don't take weird supplements so rear
supplements to
push or shunt or whatever you think it's
doing with carbohydrates it doesn't push
normally
it's the same thing by the way and it
doesn't either right it doesn't either
of those things um
yes stop
stop doing this stop
uh another thing that you maybe have
seen it shows what about like pump up
stuff
pump up stuff um i want to start early
pumping up i like overly pumping is
overly pumping is very silly again you
burn glycogen if you start four hours
really good luck getting a pump on stage
um
generally less is more when it comes to
pumping up like if you see the class
before you lining up to go on stage and
they go on stage now they're lining your
class up start to pump like that's
probably fine do some push-ups sip on a
gatorade because it's a fast gi carb and
by the time you hit stage that's in
10-15 minutes it's gonna actually make
you look a little more veiny you're
gonna look a little more full and you're
gonna hold the poses better and you're
gonna look you're gonna actually fill
out even more on stage so all the guys
that are
fading because they were pumping up for
35 minutes before uh you're gonna be
getting sharper it's it's every fucking
time every time i'll see guys my guys
get moved to the they're here and then
the guy in the middle fades and my guy
goes bloop there you go you win
congratulations mario style on top yeah
just literally jumps over everybody and
he's a turtle turns into a turtle shell
explodes and that's it the guy dies
right there on stage that better be like
the first thing scott the video guy puts
into the this better be the first thing
we talk about
what the fuck are they talking about
super mario brothers
sorry for those of you born after the
year 2000 super reddit brothers would
have done asking some motherfuckers
playing i will get to that in a second
um
another mistake one more mistake one
more mistake for natural competitors
again like like i told you guys
the water and sodium and things of that
nature are fairly consistent i will see
uh coaches
start to taper sodium water down like
starting
tuesday and there'll be a no water the
day of
no sodium the
friday no water no sodium and like
trying to quote unquote dry them out but
it's like it's a natural competitor they
don't have these weird compounds that
cause extra uh
water storage so that's not something
you generally need to do with a natural
person
when you see that kind of stuff with
enhanced people it's because they're on
different kinds of compounds and
different kinds of compounds cause
different effects inside of each person
and and it's it's even intra and
inter-individual so it's like
stop trying to pull water by literally
pulling out sodium and water because it
just makes you look worse the
subcutaneous water is actually retained
because
there's like
an aldosterone loop that's going on and
the cortisol increases and you actually
look worse so
stop trying to pull out water from
natural competitors stop trying to pull
out sodium so if you're a daddy
competitor and you got to do something
crazy in peak week to get extra shredded
like if you're not shredded already
you're kind of pretty much fucked up
yeah it's like it's not waterproof it's
not it's not worth it yeah it's not
water it's always water for me it's not
water everyone else is fat right yeah
for you it's definitely you're just
watering right now man
also fat
not me it's watery i'm ready to go on
stage
i'm peeled yeah i'm too lazy like your
wrist veins look at your wrist it's
freaky the judges are like listen we
knew it's a healthy federation you have
a vein on top of your hand the
motherfucker's ever seen shit like that
all right check this out two more
questions and then we uh wrap up the
video
you
just won nationals got your pro card
not literally but i'm setting up
scenario okay
what's your go-to
meal diet's over bro
what are we eating jared oh boy
you don't see me
don't say lady parts
uh
i think viewing
the competitive bodybuilding experience
in this light is potentially hazardous
to your psychological health
i'll put it that way that's a lot of big
words i don't understand does that mean
pancake or burger it means both
water burger pancake dip in there shell
it down your throat
all right i got a just a patty just a
pancake on a plate i pour water over
them shits and i eat it perfect that's
what i would do
so why are you so against the focusing
on the cheat meal right after the show
i'm against that i'm against uh refeeds
for similar reasons um
i just think that
when you're ingraining these behaviors
of like
did you say grain and grainy we're
sponsored by big grains we're sponsoring
a big grain big farmer too
these patterns of binging and then uh
going back into a deficit and binging
it's it's not good and it actually is
sort of mimicking uh like eating
disorder style behavior in people
so if your big thing is that you were so
fucking hungry the entire prep the lat
the only thing you think about was like
the cheat meal at the end i have no idea
why you're doing this to yourself and i
think it's something that you should
either one reassess your entire plan
um
two look into like fprh and how they can
help you there's probably a video on fpr
food pallet reward hypothesis we have a
whole video on anti-hunger strategies
that will be out watch that video it's
probably very smart and if you're doing
anything outside of that or your coach
wants you to like do weird shit like
continue eating cereal cereal is great
like a post-training thing for like a
high gi source but if you're like
continuing to eat cereal like four weeks
out it's probably a bad idea because
making you really sure it's making you
hungry as hell so if you are getting to
the state in which you're just like
excessively hungry and your coaches are
telling you this is what it takes you
know maybe you recess uh
if you are you're gonna be hungry i'm
not lying i'm not gonna say you're not
but
if you can withstand a 16 week contest
prep diet you can withstand
not only holding your hand in victory
but also
holding out for another like week slowly
increase your calories that night you'll
have like some pretty clean carbohydrate
sources it's not like you just carve up
with fucking thousand grams of carbs the
last two days like shouldn't that be
enough so you good clean whole foods
good clean whole foods for the next week
if you can and even if that's like here
you go have at it here's some good clean
whole foods eat up drink a fucking glass
of water first have your vegetables
first and then try to eat as many clean
carbs as you can probably do vegetables
i promise you it's not a lot you can eat
a lot of clean carbs after that
so do that if few times a day have like
you know have that muffin that you were
wanting maybe eat a cookie um and then
just kind of like try to stay on track
on diet like i'm also not a fan of
excessive rebound like rebound show like
uh what do they call it reverse dieting
bullshit yeah i'm not a fan of that
either uh the traditional sense of
reverse dieting was literally like
adding in a few calories a day so that
you stayed super lean and you could
quote unquote get the most out of it but
you're getting less out of it because
you're staying below 80 body fat and
you're not even putting back the lean
tissue on you lost yet so it's just like
what are you doing
so i'm not a fan of
crazy reverse dieting but i'm not a fan
of just like stuffing your face with a
bunch of bullshit and ingraining that
poor behavior pattern into you so you're
saying go to maintenance go to
maintenance go to maintenance eat a
bunch of clean carbs uh for most people
like 150 pound man maintenance carbs is
probably like 300 350 carbs anyway yeah
so there you go boom and then afterwards
when you're not super hungry anymore a
week later you go out with your
significant other to a restaurant yes
sir has a nice meal you can enjoy it
without being like psychotic about it
yeah so just like tell yourself at the
start of the diet this diet lasts my
show's in 15 weeks and this diet lasts
16. yo
that's some galaxy brain shit
that's it
to literally quote meno
and i kid you not
and i'm not gonna say what i said but
meno
looked at me and goes yo that's some
einstein shit right there and i forever
knew that i was smart because if metal
thinks i'm einstein that's what i got
out of it
last question jared before we let you go
off to your
white trash existence thank you so much
reddit tells me your haircut is stupid
and by extension so are you
feel free to address the crowd i'm
stupid because of my hair your haircut
implies a degree of stupidity that is
you know obvious

pink and purple and green hair

teeth are like if someone just drank
drano for the first 15 years of their
life
my parent might have
