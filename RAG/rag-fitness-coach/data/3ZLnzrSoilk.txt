i'm gonna take every set to failure for
four weeks in a row train or die
yeah nobody actually does that nobody
nobody does that i promise except for uh
and if you and if you think you do
please come to michigan and we will put
you through four weeks of that
specifically
dr mike here
this is jared feather
he is
the renaissance periodization head
of competitive physique
coaching and he's usually on private
planes with billionaires
diamond mines that's the kind of places
he frequents because he's upper crust
while your boys down here in a basement
studio making videos for you to get
educated but
one of his private planes crashed and he
of course literally came out with a
golden parachute yeah
landed in our yard unfortunately zipped
him in here he is
jared recently you've been a go-to guy
as a coach
and helper
to a lot of ifbb pros and other super
high level bodybuilders pretty recent
for you yeah
i saw it happen myself
as soon as you won
um nationals and your pro card
motherfucking pros just came out of the
woodwork it's like is that like a tree
tree tree and then nationals happens
like that middle person's not a tree at
all that's an iphone pro that's now
walking over to us to ask jared
hey what about this peak so
it's a mystical thing like what do the
pros do right like let's be honest i
missed fight by the shit you guys
watching are mystified by it it's like i
wonder what they're doing
what has been some of your experience
recently as like expectation versus
reality type of shit the good the bad
the ugly the beautiful
uh
first i'll do the good
obviously no no no no we do the bad
first the good music you have no idea
how to make a fucking compliment
sandwich you're in your mind yeah i'll
try a compliment sandwich you don't
train hard what's that they like to
train hard oh the sandwich they like
pros like to train hard sometimes they
fail
miserably at training hard at training
hard but they give their best effort
damn kind of a compliment it's tasty oh
it's fine
on the taste
amazing ketchup sandwich yum
delicious ketchup sandwiches are things
that destitute people eat
mentally destitute
uh okay so let's talk about this okay so
a lot of guys say pros train super hard
it's almost certainly true for a ton of
pros
but is it a universal rule we can kind
of depend on so for example
i meet a lawyer i assume he knows the
law generally it's a dependable rule um
if i need a mathematician i assume i'll
fucking count to 10. if i need an eye to
be pro
is he for sure just on another level of
hard training or is it a mixed bag
okay so ifbb pro
insinuates some level of enhancement
and
with what i've experienced and what i've
just noticed even growing through the
natural stages of bodybuilding
and following a lot of these guys uh the
enhancement does a lot more than uh
anything else they're doing and the
genetics in the genetics enhancement
genetics that's all that is that is i'm
gonna just put eighty percent to it
eighty percent of bodybuilding is that
at the i think it's just training
somehow training somehow
so when someone says that
well so-and-so did this i'm like yeah so
they fucking they trained with weights
awesome and then they took anabolics so
they're getting credit for training
somehow with weights
but they're not getting any special
credit like basically what you're saying
is if you look up to pros and you're a
fucking hard training nanny who weighs
160 you may very well be training harder
than your favorite pros and not just
that you may
be training too hard like
because it is often that they will post
like a short clip of let's say like
somebody taking an eight plate deadlift
for three reps four reps five reps
whatever it may be
and then the rest of the session is like
let's say they did at the beginning of
their back session for whatever fucking
reason because they all like to do that
um the rest of the session is like lat
pull downs with six seven eight nine ten
in the tank uh bros with
swinging crazy jerking motions with like
ten in the tank and it's like
people try to top this thing where
yeah well all my favorite pros take
everything to failure and i've honestly
never in my fucking life seen that ever
i've
never trained with a pros for a while
now a long time yeah even before i was
even in real life yeah
i've never seen an a true
full session
everything was to failure every working
center every working set to failure and
beyond type of session it's like
this person started off doing incline
bench and they ended up doing
some sort of weird flat press by the end
because their ass was so far off the
seat because they're focused on getting
too many reps it's like did they ever
take their upper pec fibers to failure i
have no fucking idea it just kind of got
hard and they started shifting things
around so it's like i've never seen a
true technical
failure session through the entire thing
and anything done past like
10 12 working sets in one session was
always just bullshit fluff curling like
this like swinging it and then like
tricep extensions where they're going
like this and they just stop it's like
yeah great okay this is pretty light and
they have like 15 left and i don't know
where it's just like they're done
one time i saw a pro warming up i want
to say who this is i've seen this on a
few occasions
i was you know what i'm saying i beat
the scene i i fucking so
just
doing my own shit and i look at them and
i swear to god this i thought this
motherfucker was warming up for 45
minutes straight and then he just leaves
i was like oh that was workout yeah
stuff i've seen that frequently
uh so i've been
very
fortunate to be around top pros
as a recent
and i will tell you they train
hard as shit like they train hard um
but it's cool because the more that i
see
even people that we maybe disagree with
on like a large fraction of information
so like i'm going to say like jp for
example even if we disagree with him on
a lot of shit he's like out there
a huge guy todding two in the tank one
in the tank hard two hard sets in the
beginning of the session back offsets
things that we generally agree with and
a lot of the pros start taking that that
sort of nuanced approach way more
nuanced than what they were doing before
and at least they're leaving reps in the
tank and they're training really hard
they're trying to get close to failure
they're taking back offsets when they
need to instead of trying to do like
five sets of the same weights
it's it's very cool because
it used to be like a reverse pyramid
silo training where everyone was like i
did 12 reps with 135 then i went to 145
then i did 185 then to 25. i like to do
low reps when i'm tired so it's totally
pointless exactly and then at least
there are people like jp out there and
john jewetts out there
saying similar things that we are with
leaving groups in the tank and here's
periodization here's how it works here's
a model john joy it's a good guy to
follow amazing yeah follow john do it
100
um
so they're at least saying like look do
your heavy shit first take the fibers
pretty close to failure and then you can
do some back off work and even if their
back off work is complete garbage and
they're still training how they used to
train and they're leaving like six in
the tank
one they're enhanced
two they did pretty hard work in the
beginning of the session so that's great
uh and three they just don't have like
the prerequisite knowledge to understand
like okay we're starting to see that
anything much past 10 sets in a single
session is kind of like meh you're not
really doing much after that these are
like really these are things that we now
have to push that type of information
out there like at least eruption reserve
and relative intensity and those types
of things are getting they're getting
more popularized by people and now it's
just like slowly integrating more and
more sports science because you know
these guys have been right about a lot
of shit for a long time the bros they've
been writing about a lot of shit science
sometimes has to catch up sometimes it
disproves things they've been saying
completely so they've been wrong about
some shit too oh tons of shit
yeah so like you know people who are
saying every set needs to be taken to
failure that's just flat out fucking
wrong especially from a similar fatigue
ratio perspective but it feels my ego
that i need to prove to myself
100 and then they still don't do it
right but at least i'm going to take
every step to failure for four weeks in
a real trainer fucking luck
yeah nobody actually does that nobody
does it nobody does that i promise
except for uh and if you and if you
think you do please come to michigan and
we will put you through four weeks of
that specifically
just stop saying you could live i
received a failure
you won't be alive down the street for
myself no fuck no it doesn't happen it's
not a thing it's a big wave
good thing huge wave
all right that's training what about
diet are these guys uh counting
everything to the gram
milligram
you know they're counting milligrams you
know what i'm saying even if they're
doing that to be honest true
damn that looks like two to me three
hey
whatever same shit
it's bad none of this is really a joke
no none of this is a joke at all all
right
diet how serious are the pros in your
experience uh
i've met more guys that
cheat on their diet and don't i mean
like
when you're that insanely strict with
stuff and and like coaches and grain
this weird level of neuroticism that
doesn't need to be there
uh you crack more it's just a thing
you're just gonna crack on your diet
it's it's difficult to
prep six seven meals a day make sure
that you're eating exactly oatmeal and
exactly rice and this one and exactly
steak in this one it's like it's just
it's crazy to see that these types of
structures and diets especially when
it's illegal to fucking do that in the
first place the only person
extrapolated
food content or this than this than this
exact food exact foods uh telling
someone to do that is technically
illegal and if you're a registered
dietitian you you're the only person
that has power to do that only an rd so
john keep doing your thing man everybody
else what the fuck are you doing oops
you're not john jewett you don't have an
rd right so it's like
so you don't tell people what to eat
exactly no no way in hell yeah no
there's a there's a list of foods that
fit into a
certain amount of each kind of nutrient
so macro coaching quote unquote is fine
i take it a little bit further than that
and i'm like hey you should have this
about this much
this many ounces of meat here you should
have about this many grams of
carbohydrates here and this much fat
here and here's a list of all the types
of foods that fit into these columns
pick and choose
and if you and there's a huge
questionnaire it's like if you have any
sort of condition you know about celiacs
etc obviously tell me before we get
started i'll push you to an rd or if
it's something i'm able to work with i'm
going to take those foods out that
irritate whatever your whatever your
condition is
i have a condition where if i don't eat
enough gluten i guess sad yeah me too
man pizza yeah unfortunately deep into
the diet
this just i'm taking it out man
i lied i'll help you up here i cheat all
the time
i know a lot of people do i wake up in
the middle of the night to cheat great
i will say that uh i'm impressed by how
much some of these guys can eat
all they can eat a lot the pros andy
impresses me all the time and he's a big
motherfucker yeah i coach a 300 pound
guy he's coming back from like a bunch
of injuries and stuff
he doesn't look injured now yeah he's
doing great
how much does he eat he told me about
his diet once and i was like what yeah
it's it's insane like daily the grinder
he's dying
he's dieting he's 300 pounds he's eating
like 600 grams of carbs right now and
he's losing two pounds of fucking day
he's like i'm telling him tell my coach
i gotta eat more man i'm like yeah tell
them
jesus christ
so your your take has been that pros
generally do things more correctly than
the average gym person absolutely
um and the more winning pros are more
meticulous like john jewett
but most of the guys are doing a good
job but there's a spectrum and then some
of the guys really just kind of fuck up
a lot but genetics and drugs carry
everyday
uh and then some guys are super precise
and they generally tend to win
some fractionally more but not like
night and day yeah when you when you
again using john as an example he's a
fucking amazing example when he's going
against people like keon and and sean
people with insane genetics for like
muscle bellies he's gotta bring that
person he has to bring that it's like he
john is the natural kid sitting behind
the computer that has pretty good shape
and does everything fucking right that
shows up to natural shows in the best
shape ever and he beats out the guys
with with like
good shape like muscle shape right he's
that guy i'm sorry for the enhanced side
of bodybuilding damn fucking amazing
meticulous very meticulous
so if you take somebody with great
muscle building shape
and they can get conditioned and they're
very nuanced and very meticulous someone
like myself or charlie
you're winning this is how it is
i'm certainly an example of amazing
muscle shape i look like a toaster i've
been told at bodybuilding shows you
actually have great shape when you get
very muscular you just gotta get rid of
the water
that's what i tell myself every day
well like you're like a hollingshead
the shed the yeah you got that hauling
said muscle similar shade yeah yeah yeah
he's chess huge delts just like really
round yeah he looks cool man
i wish i could talk like him because i
imagine he's like oh you fucking fucks
you fucking british that sounds more
like a diasha type yeah
i need to work on my british accents if
you're from england or the surrounding
municipalities let me know how my accent
was if you're from missouri
your old boy did it he's famous and he's
from missouri
if you're they don't have a draw
[Music]
yeah of course
say
hello sir that's a fine truck you have
but in derp oh shit
you could change the words i just yeah
of course i'm going to right nobody says
how many that thing got man goddamn
double goddamn injection engine over
there boy
dad tell you what
[Music]
all right dog got it
we'll catch you guys later
