hey folks doctor mike is telling
renaissance periodization
real quick before i start the actual
topic which is
my show day peak
for my bodybuilding transformation
hopefully you're tuning in last week and
the week before if not
then check those videos out
something that has been bothering me for
some time and i want to tell you guys
about it and ask for your opinion so
please feel free to comment below
like um
the song maniac you know she's a maniac
man
song
there's a claim one of the lyrics is
she's she's dancing like she's never
danced before
now are we supposed to take that as
option a
her normal dancing game is quite high
and she's elevated to an altogether new
level of expressiveness fluidity
coordination and just general impressive
ability
or is the accusation that
she's dancing like she's never danced
before an insult being that her dancing
is so terrible
that clearly she has no practice and
dancing according to the
singer observer in this case
let me know which one you think it is
brilliant minds are curious about it but
something less intellectual is my
bodybuilding transformation show day
details so last week's video talked all
the way up through the peak week now
what actually happened during the
competition day well here's the super
top secret shit behind the scenes woke
up at 6 00 am
and that was awful because i had to go
touch up the tan and it's when you talk
to tanning people and you're like hey
when do i have to touch this up because
friday i got my first tan and they're
like yeah i just come around
at 6 30 am and i was like god damn it
because
it's hours until you have to go to the
show and i'm like okay fuck i like my
sleep i like my morning sleep i showed
up anyway
tanning is a trip because you basically
just have your dick out in front of a
bunch of women actually and other men
and other bodybuilders and everyone's so
over it that like you just look at other
bodybuilders and you like look at each
other's bodies dicks everywhere and
you're just like
what up and they're like
nobody cares so that was interesting
came back after the tan touch-up went
back to sleep surprisingly i was able to
sleep i did a lot of like um
preparation mentally for the show and i
told myself i wasn't going to get
anxious and i wasn't going to allow
myself to get anxious for long because
anxiety is stupid and pointless and it's
a fucking bodybuilding show who gives a
shit right
and i successfully pulled that off so i
was like came back and i was like oh i
can go back to sleep and i did
and at 8 am woke up and went to go to
the pump up area because the show was
supposed to start at 9. they told us
they'd be there by eight got there by
eight
and um
found out that the show pump up area was
outdoors and it was 45 degrees
so what the fuck
so back to the room
and went to chill and sleep and got a
bunch of sleep and luckily my uh coach
and handler at the time uh there at the
bottom of the show jared feather came in
huge as he always does for all of his
clients um because he hung around that
area and texted me when it was time for
me to come back so i could just chill
turns out as quite predicted judging
occurred at around 12 p.m which means i
started pumping up oh just kind of
feeling out the area at 11
by you know 11 45 i was really actually
pumping up and
then i was on stage
for like i don't know we were on stage
for five minutes or something like that
i was done by 12 p.m
i went back to the room and consumed
rice cakes jam and whey pudding not as
good as you would think that sounds
70 grams of protein
and
about zero grams of fat and 300 grams of
carbs i wanted that last tightening up
refilling because when you're posing on
stage and prejudging you do burn some
glycogen you want it refilled
and barely any water because i'm still
trying to dehydrate at this point i was
looking better and better every few
hours because of the dehydration and the
fluid shift and i was like oh shit okay
and i was actually able to sleep uh and
chill a bit more i was really surprised
because i really don't sleep well when i
have tanner on it feels awful all i'm
gonna do as soon as i get spray tan i
want to take a shower fucking
immediately and i just hate it covering
about i hate it i hate it i hate it i'm
trying to sleep and i usually can't but
this time i got a great night of sleep
before and i slept throughout the whole
day it was really awesome
7 p.m i emerge from my delirium
and walk to the night show
on the walk over i went hypoglycemic i
was like oh shit
remind you there was no insulin use at
the time uh so i was like okay fuck and
i had 70 grams of carbs from rice cakes
that that fixed me
sat around backstage it was a lot of
people had gone by then it was only the
heavies and the supers left
and i actually met mark lobliner uh
chilled with him didn't know who he was
found out shortly after met uh jose
raymond super famous ultra bodybuilder
who was actually uh mark's prep coach
and they were super chill i didn't even
know who i was talking to until like
half an hour and i was like oh shit you
guys are the shit i know about you and
they're like oh yeah stop this and that
um and then the finals were done by 8 30
p.m
i took second place and the class of
like eight super heavies which was kind
of neat i was the shortest and the
leanest which was awesome it was short i
didn't pick but the lean that was really
cool and uh
then i went back to the hotel room and
took the best shower ever because holy
crap a day and a half of not being able
to shower all that tanner it's awful
amazing religious shower left the hotel
by 9 pm this was in scottsdale arizona
got went right to albertson's grocery
store got a ton of diet sodas because
i'm ultra dehydrated at this point i had
a little bit of water to drink right
after the show strawberries apples uh
some melon
and ate that stuff um during the drive
back to las vegas which takes quite some
time about three hours into the drive we
stopped at a gas station myself jared
and our friend doug and uh we i had a
bunch of protein bars and quest protein
chips
and i didn't pee
until
the next morning
and had like probably two gallons of
fluid and no pee because my body was so
dehydrated that it was like ah we're
keeping all this
and then afterwards i had the diet
recovery and everything like that that
stuff we will cover in another episode
