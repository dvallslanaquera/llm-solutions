one more Marvin let's go elbows in force
them in immediately and and and down
slow down slow down slow
[Music]
what up RP YouTube I'm here with Marvin
my client from Hong Kong uh today we are
going to be doing a barbell only lateral
delt and bicep session trying to bring
you guys some limited equipment sessions
that we're doing for the YouTube channel
so today is going to be one that you can
really fry your lateral delts and your
biceps with just with the barbell it's
going to be a lot of fun fun I say
insert Marvin's agonizing face here and
uh yeah we're gonna hop to it and biceps
first lateral adults after that and
then Marvin's uh and doom your your
paint your penis pain it's coming the
agony let's get it
Laurel bicep curl technique you've seen
it a million times on the YouTube
channel probably on Instagram social
media whatever
the bicep has
help
and glennel glenohumeral Joint action
including forward flexion
this is literally shortening your bicep
more
so when you see people on the internet
talking about how you need to keep your
elbows back you need to stay here at 90
degrees it's all based on people
thinking that forced production is the
only thing that matters disadvantages
and positions of training don't matter
Etc when you combine the action of that
forward flexion of the going hemoral
joint and you create a little bit of
tension here inward on the bicep you are
shortening the hell out of this head of
your bicep and you are not taking any
tension off at the top I understand what
people are saying when I say tension off
of the biceps if you go like this
because their elbows are here I I it's
hard for me to contract my bicep too the
second you have that forward flexion at
the glenohumeral joint and you're
pushing your elbows in you're
Contracting the hell out of your bicep
so that just limits the the load you can
use notice he was really curling super
well before I gave him a couple of cues
and then how hard it looked for him to
do that people don't like to limit the
load on the exercise when you curl with
your your elbows at your side at 90
degrees it's easy as fuck to use like 95
pounds 135 pounds if you're someone like
me but I don't give a shit about the
weight on the bar and you guys really
shouldn't either we want a good stimulus
to the biceps we want full motor unit
recruitment of the biceps and that's
done by going through a full range of
motion including all actions of that
particular muscle including Again full
reflection at the gleneral humeral
joints this is okay it shortens the
bicep fully so hopefully you guys we can
get that into people's heads it's
definitely fine to do this if you find
it this com like discomfort in that
movement anywhere at the at the shoulder
at the bicep maybe you have some nagging
elbow injuries fuck yeah do a drag curl
for elbow injuries I notice when I keep
my elbows back a little more it does it
helps quite a bit if you just want to
add it in for variation purposes totally
fine too but doing a curl like this
there's no Dogma you don't have to uh
but don't shit talk it it's definitely
fine and it actually recruits a lot more
money into your biceps it's fucking hard
I think that's where all this comes from
it's hard when things are hard we notice
more than likely there are a shitload of
excuses and you can come up with as many
scientific excuses or as many bro
excuses as you want but I just I know
it's hard you want to find an excuse to
load up a bunch of weight
so you do you try to find whatever
excuse you can so just keep that in mind
with this type of bicep curl you don't
have to do it but try it out man it's
really good it's really fun and it hurts
really bad like you're gonna notice
watch where Marvin does these elbows in
down slow with your elbows in down the
elbows in and right back up
full stretch Marvin full stretch Marvin
full stretch
and up elbows in elbows in elbows in
elbows in elbows in
Down Slow Down slow down
so you're gonna notice these are
absolutely fucking painful
so what a lot of people tend to do with
the eccentric on these
and this is why people also say that
tension gets uh taken away from the
bicep is they'll move their shoulders
forward
you want to keep those shoulders back so
you can really stretch the bicep so when
it gets hard you're going to notice he's
going to want to do this because it's
literally taking tension away you move
like this you are taking this off the
bicep you want them here which is why
it's very odd to me that people say when
they're here you're taking attention off
because it's actually more so when you
move your shoulder forward that's less
tension so he's going to be going like
this to try to get away from that pain
but I'm really want him to slow or
slowly from right here to stretch the
hell out of that bicep and then instead
of resting a long time down here and
Swinging I'm trying to get him to I'm
cueing him to really come right back up
once you get that full stretch full
stretch right back up with the elbows in
it sucks and it's true quote unquote
constant tension especially here at the
top and especially here at the bottom
with your shoulder back that's pump
already yeah it's numb Marvin this might
be a little heavy but we're going to use
this weight again okay
well you might get like six reps on your
first you know back in the day so it's
like 15 kg but look like shit now I like
this so like this and elbows four elbows
forward
that was not a full rep all the way down
Marvin all the way down
yep up up
[Music]
sounds slow
let's get one more just like that up
down down slow down
rack
check it out Shake It Out
check it out I'm gonna take some weight
off
so you can stay there stay there
I was out in front
only full stretch mark no bullshit reps
full stretch all the way down back up
elbows in elbows in and you change the
movement with pushing your elbow shorts
each other like you're trying to touch
them together
elbows down
elbows in yep
good Marvin let's do two more come on
all the way up squeeze elbows squeeze
last one squeeze squeeze squeeze
down slow
real quick set it down for a couple
seconds oh take it out check it out
check it out oh two more people go away
two more let's go okay
straight straight arms first straight
arms first
down slow elbows in
keeping levels in keeping elbows in when
you curl okay in in in in in in all the
way down slow down slow down slow
wow
it's kind of turned into a tricep
so I did say two bicep exercises we're
already at the bar as you can see
[Music]
um so we're probably doing about
exercise that we've never done on the
channel before and to be honest this is
something that like
if you're someone with nagging elbow
injuries how I talked about earlier a
drag curl isn't that bad of an exercise
um
any time that I've had some sort of
tennis elbow going on epicondylitis
I've definitely taken more of a to the
side approach or behind the body
approach with like a drag curl
oh I'm gonna have Marvin do a couple
sets of 15 to 20 drag curls uh getting
the bar as high as possible on that drag
curl there's maybe a couple things that
we can give you technique-wise you've
never heard about a drag curl to uh hit
the bicep a little better
so we might put the tens back on them I
have them more up at the bar and we'll
see how he likes these so two sets of 15
to 20 for drag curls with very short
rest periods
now back to the normal technique I want
you to use just your arms
so yep just your arms
go ahead I'm gonna squeeze I wasn't I
wasn't oh good yep squeeze hard down
slow
all the way down I was in squeeze hard
squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze
up come on
down slow
let's go Marvin
good down slow
up squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze keep
going keep going now we're just resist
resist resist resist me okay
Down Slow Down slow down slow down slow
good
oh
yeah I try I tried
oh can you imagine week four like this
you'd be tossed oh yeah
people always say oh I don't need Dilo I
say you don't train hard enough
how could you not
I mean how could you not have Dilo for
every week four the body their body
usually DeLoach for them so what happens
to those types of people it's like
I don't need a deload and then their
lower body is injured like they have a
bad knee or something so then they take
their leg training volume goes down or
they're still trying to train really
fucking hard without her body yeah and
then something happens to the upper body
when their leg heals and they're
training hard for the lower body so they
have like these weird intermittent
deloads periodically because their
bodies like you're fucking deloading so
okay that's a bad deal though exactly a
painful yeah Auto regulated delos are
much better yes
foreign
so the way I like to structure PM
sessions which is what this is for
Marvin
is
two in one because I train my lateral
adults and biceps
three to four times a week
So today we're doing two bicep exercises
or even if it was just one bicep
exercise but it was top and down sets I
count that as two two different
exercises technically
so we did the biceps now we're going to
do one
intensity technique for his lateral
adults
I'm going to put them through a very
short rest period giant set for upright
uh slightly bent forward upright rows
uh gonna really smash the lateral delts
yes the upright row is going to hit the
level that was very well
and uh
probably gonna do about 50 reps so
let's warm it up and see what you're
going to use all right yep at the hips
slightly lean forward like this and hold
the elbows pull high as high as possible
Marvin I want you to really get it up
there look here yeah
50 reps of this shit
[Music]
you feel ready yeah I'm ready you feel
like your forearms or biceps will be the
limiting factor
tidbit there for you personal trainers
who approach your clients
a couple of factors to know if they're
ready for the next exercise or the next
set I'm asking him about his assisting
musculature so I said do you think that
your forearms or your biceps will be the
limiting factor in their set over your
lateral adults and he said no he said I
feel pretty good to go I think my
lateral adults will take most of
stimulus that's good
when you get to the top don't lean
forward too much right there okay good
that's slightly before
ah again
good right
13.
14 please
14 when I found the last one
[Music]
oh
it's 20 right
oh shit you can stand upright leaning
forward Lean Forward upright row yeah
limits the load yeah because it's a lot
harder and I'm more disadvantageous
position but yeah it's pretty good for
lateral adults upright rows are a little
easier and they're more mechanically
advantageous just go to a regular
upright row okay so we can finish off
the okay the 50 reps so I don't think
you're getting 50 if we keep everything
forward
[Music]
ah
don't swing don't use your hips
one more
good wreck
[Music]
it's getting hotter and hotter so
actually Marvin let's get as many as you
can here one in the tank and then we're
just gonna use your arms okay let's
finish it off cool all right cool up
come on
up high
[Music]
one or two more one or two more let's go
don't swing don't swing don't swing try
to use the delta
there it is good good shut down
arms arms on yep
five more one
two beautiful Asian chicks man good
stuff
three
four last one I'm gonna use the top I
want you to hold and squeeze hold
squeeze elbows High elbows High elbows
High elbows High squeeze squeeze hard
squeeze Marvin not squeezing I can tell
[Music]
yeah good
ah
fuck
[Laughter]
good job man thank you man how was that
painful you got a nice pumping adults oh
yeah good shit I mean I wish my dad was
always this pump all the time
oh wow well people there you have it
hopefully I gave you some good uh tips
tricks coaching cues all that fun shit
uh and maybe we'll make a Believer out
of you yet that these exercises are
really good for training the biceps in
the lateral adults Marvin how do you
feel I feel odd awful we can't stop
bouncing himself so I assume that's a
good idea awesome but awful feeling
awesome and awful yeah that's kind of
how I described it yesterday oh
yes yeah good man you did a great job
