that right there is honestly a
disqualifying statement all on its own
you know i don't care whether you have
11 million subscribers or 11 subscribers
no one should be allowed to make
outlandish obviously false claims like
that and still be taken seriously as a
fitness coach
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and today i'm going to be responding to
a recent
fairly insane video from jeff cavaliere
of athlean x
titled get bigger arms in 22 days
guaranteed
what's up guys chef cavalier
athletenext.com today i continue our
popular 22 day series and this one guys
the big promise is this i'm going to
help you
to build bigger arms guaranteed and to
be clear
his video title is not meant as
hyperbole so
he doesn't clarify once you start
watching that you know okay now that
you're here guys obviously we all know
that you can't build
you know significant arm size in just
three weeks this is just an
extra little arm routine that you can
follow since the previous 5 000 arm
workouts that i've already uploaded
clearly aren't enough
no he's actually just gone full chloe
ting at this point and he's just
straight up
portraying this 22 days to bigger muscle
series
as being something completely legitimate
by the time these 22 days are over
your biceps and tricep size are gonna be
much more significant than they are
right now
and those t-shirts of yours are gonna be
a lot more filled up than they are
right now now if you're a die-hard
athlete x-fan especially if you're still
a beginner
which clearly makes up the vast majority
of jeff's audience as evidenced by the
fact that nobody in his comment section
uh on his video even questions the
ridiculous claims that he's making here
and in that case this is probably just
going to go in one ear and out the other
but for those who are sort of more on
the fence and who are open to thinking
critically and absorbing
new information let's make this really
clear and i'll explain
why this actually matters in just a
minute here and there are two reasons
but let's make it clear that you are not
going to achieve
significant muscle growth in a given
body part in the way that
jeff is describing here you're not going
to do that over a span of just 22 days
period okay not gonna happen no one who
actually knows what they're talking
about
no legitimate fitness coach no
experienced lifter who's actually been
at this for
any length of time and understands what
it takes to build muscle as a natural
no one including jeff cavaliere actually
thinks this okay you're not gonna make
dramatic increases in your arm size in
just three weeks
you're just not okay this type of
content is nothing more than a [ __ ]
gimmick
designed purely for clicks and views
just like probably 90
plus of build bigger arms videos on
youtube are
most of those videos um not all of them
you know there of course
is such a thing as legit useful arm
training advice and
viable arm exercise variations that you
can experiment with
but a very high percentage of the time
let's say it's really just fluff advice
that's created for the sake of mass
appeal
and that's because for whatever reason
most beginners out there think that
building bigger biceps is this
absolutely critical thing for their
physique
and that they need to place a ton of
focus on this one really small area
when in reality it's actually massively
overrated and it won't impact your
physique nearly as much as you think
and it doesn't require anything fancy to
build in the first place

content hit that like button below if
you haven't already
and let's continue on and of course i
didn't forget about day 22 see that's
where we break out that measuring tape
once again
wrap it around the arm and then see
objectively exactly how well you did
guys i wouldn't be surprised
if you made even an inch of size gains a
full inch of additional arm size in
22 days guys do you actually realize
how much an inch of arm size actually is
that's a very significant amount of mass
to put on your arms it's a significant
amount of mass to put on any body part
even for a larger area like
your quads and hamstrings or your chest
and lats
so to stand there on camera and claim
with a straight face
that by following my routine you can put
a full inch on your arms in 22 days
that right there is honestly a
disqualifying statement all on its own
you know i don't care whether you have
11 million subscribers or 11 subscribers
no one should be allowed to make
outlandish obviously false claims like
that and still be taken seriously as a
fitness coach
and just as a side note here uh while
we're on the issue of exaggerating
things for the sake of clicks and views
notice how when jeff does his arm
measurement he only puts the bigger
numbers on the measuring tape front and
center in the camera
even though the end of the measuring
tape is actually all the way up here
so unless the viewer takes the time to
look more closely at it
at first glance it looks like jeff has
these gigantic 19-inch arms
when in reality just looking at the tape
you can see that they're probably
something more like
in the 16-inch range which is still
really impressive for someone of jeff's
stature and leanness i'm not knocking
him there at all he clearly has really
well developed arms
but why not just be honest and show your
actual arm measurement you know why
purposely hide it and then twist the
tape around to make it seem way bigger
than it actually is you know it's just
an example of the sort of
gimmicky nature of a lot of athleanex's
content in general but coming back to
the point here
um if you're a natural lifter with
around average genetics
and you do everything right in terms of
training and nutrition and you stay
consistent in case you're not just
putting on a bunch of fat you know
anybody can build big arms if they are
stuffing their face all day long with
eskimo pies but you're not gonna gain a
full inch on your arms in three weeks
you're not even gonna gain a full inch
on your arms in three months okay
depending on your genetics
realistically it's probably gonna take
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
six to 12 months to gain that first full
inch of quality upper arm mass again
assuming you're staying reasonably lean
you know nobody cares when people
brag in the comments about having 18
inch arms when they're 27
body fat we're talking about lean
quality mass here but
outside of some parallel universe in
another dimension where
the laws of physics are set up so that
jeff cavalier really can strict curl 135
pounds for reps
using real weights no one is gonna be
putting an inch of actual muscle mass on
their arms in three weeks
and especially not by following the type
of routine that jeff posts here it's not
even a good routine really
you know all he basically does is have
you performing one exercise three times
a week for your biceps and one exercise
three times a week for your triceps
um you know he doesn't even recommend
that you increase your overall arm
training volume he just has you
splitting up your existing volume over
the course of three separate days
and then he just throws in a few extra
little techniques like
adding pulses to the top of your curls
or slowing down your negatives or
implementing certain minor form tweaks
it's honestly
nothing really special that's gonna all
of a sudden stimulate a bunch of new arm
growth
now there's nothing really wrong with
the little techniques that he shows here
you know you can do these exercise
variations if you'd like you know you
can add some little
pulses on your curling exercises or you
can change the position of your wrist on
your push downs
but there's roughly a zero percent
chance that by doing these little things
you're gonna magically end up with way
bigger arms that are
hugging at your sleeves after the course
of 22 days like
jeff is claiming here if you are gonna
specialize in a certain body part
then you're going to need to increase
the overall workload for that muscle in
some way whether it's
by increasing the total volume or the
effort per set or more exercise
variations or
some combination of all of those but
just taking your existing volume and
then splitting it up a bit
and implementing a few different form
tweaks that probably isn't going to do
much of anything
or at least it's probably not going to
do much of anything over the course of
only three weeks
it might have some longer term minor
benefit but just not in 22 days
now why does this actually matter okay
even though jeff
is obviously way over exaggerating what
you can achieve in a span of 22 days
does this actually negatively affect
anybody and i would say it definitely
can and for two
reasons so the first is that if you're
truly serious about gaining muscle and
transforming your overall physique
then having realistic expectations
matters you know you need to understand
the commitment involved
and the approximate time frames that are
going to be involved in order to see
real results so you need to get out of
this
short term instant gratification mindset
you know this idea that you're going to
put an
inch on your arms in three weeks i mean
that's like some 1990s muscle magazine
slash late night infomercial type [ __ ]
okay you need to realize that quality
muscle growth is a long-term process
it's not something that you can just
force by temporarily implementing
a few unique lifting tips okay you're
looking at a scale of at least several
months of consistent proper training
nutrition
to really see a given muscle increase in
a truly noticeable way
and to really transform your physique as
a whole like to go from
let's say generally out of shape to
having a lean strong muscular body
that most people would consider highly
impressive that's usually going to be
measured in
years okay obviously everybody is
different everyone has a different
starting point and genetics play a big
role as well
you know some people can make
significant transformations much more
quickly than the average person
and i'm also not saying that you can't
still see very solid changes in less
than a year you definitely can
but the bottom line is that nothing
serious is going to happen
over the course of 22 days now if jeff
had added some context here
and said that you know this is just
meant to be a short-term arm-focused
cycle that might give you a small bit of
extra growth
and if you really explained it in terms
of fitting this into the overall picture
then that would be a lot more reasonable
but the way this is portrayed here
i mean it's just completely and totally
goofy and the second reason why this
matters is because
ultimately an arm focused program is
going to be a waste of time
for the majority of people who are
watching this content you know the vast
majority of people
don't need to be running an arm
specialization cycle training their
biceps and triceps
six days a week with a bunch of fancy
exercises and
fancy techniques they just need to focus
on gaining overall mass and strength
throughout their entire body as a whole
on a properly structured well-balanced
program
now if you're an advanced lifter who's
been at this for a while and your arms
are
a lagging muscle group that you want to
bring up then sure you know have at it
and see if a temporary focused
body part cycle can spark some new gains
there but very few people who are
truly advanced lifters are going to be
getting their advice from athlean x
videos at least not in terms of
muscle building programming maybe for
some physical therapy type stuff
and then for the other 95 percent of
people who are watching his videos
those are going to be novice to
intermediate lifters and for those
people
this obsession with arm training is just
going to be a huge misallocation of your
focus
you don't need to perform endless bicep
curls and endless triceps extensions
most of your arm growth is just going to
come from building up your strength on
the basic compound lifts
and even your arm training itself that
really doesn't need to be anything
groundbreaking you can still achieve the
majority of your biceps and triceps
gains
off of fairly basic movements chasing
arm gains and
rearranging your whole program just to
build your arms specifically
if anything that will probably just be
counterproductive and if you want to get
access to a free
structured training program to maximize
muscle development throughout your
entire body including your arms
with a nutritional plan to go along with
it that you can follow no gimmicks no
silliness just solid muscle building and
fat loss principles that actually work
