go
go go go go that's it
oh shit okay that's how it is
sorry
that last
[Music]
folks
i'm dr mike this is jared feather
jenna geary's back by literal popular
demand her last two videos with us
crushed it the algo loved her you guys
loved her
and she's back
to do back
and jen has an unbelievable back and i'm
not talking about the lore part of the
back you feel me which is legendary her
actual back musculature is insane so
today we're gonna train it and she
thinks she's gonna have a lot of fun she
thinks she's gonna be able to show off
we know she's in for pain suffering
misery and hatred that's really kind of
the whole thing we do on this channel
jen how are you feeling i feel great i'm
ready
jared
jared lost his voice he's sick so
back training let's do it
[Music]
oh
she's warming up her laps
or pull-ups
jenna's gonna be doing pull-ups as a
first exercise you notice that she's
warming up with pull-downs which is a
really good idea kind of one of the
crazy things that people do is they
think of the bodyweight exercise
pull-ups and they just go right into it
well like it's like 200 some odd pounds
in her case like whatever she weighs
like 150 160 you don't just like go to
that for skull crushers you don't go to
that for bent rows you warm up so pull
up should be warmed up with pull downs
over the system pull-ups then when
you're ready full warm-up you know set
at 12 set of eight set of four then
you're ready to go and do pull-ups we're
gonna actually gonna do a set of two
just potentiation you get the feeling in
the movement and then we're going to let
jen go close to failure full range of
motion overhand grip chin above the ball
at the top full hanging at the bottom
let's get it done push your ponytail
over to one of your shoulders so we can
see your back oh you're going to this is
no purpose thank you so much you just
want to see my poop shoe is that what it
is because it's that high
[Music]
is that better
i'm not going to say i don't the fuck am
i crazy
just make sure the camera's off when you
say that
five phenomenal oh just like that
slow
slow one more
slow slow slow and that's it
that was great
that was great zero critiques
that was only eight though that's okay
these are tough especially slow on the
way down
control the last one don't just drop
into the last part try to go all the way
down control
don't drop into the last little like
second okay
[Music]
that's it
very good
very good how about we do two sets of
assistant now
and then do
magmas and then snag them cool so
for pull-ups
jen got a set of like eight and a set of
five we don't want to go much lower than
five it's not enough volume of work to
do a whole lot in a good set so we're
gonna do is gonna switch exercises
to sort of partner assisted pull ups
where i'm gonna grab her feet and i'm
gonna propel her up and help her and
then help her on the way down so you can
get a set of like oh again eight to 12
and another two or three sets like that
the thing with these is you can actually
because your partner can help you in a
specific way especially if they know
what they're doing whether somebody you
trust or can explain things to you can
tell them to help you in a very special
way that probably enhances hypertrophy
more and here's how you have them help
more at the top of the movement and less
at the bottom that means you get more
eccentric loading and it also means that
at the bottom you get more total load
under stretch at the top you can
complete the range of motion when you're
at a mechanical disadvantage that way
when you're helping someone or when
they're helping you if you're doing this
at home
what you can do is essentially bias the
movement into a loaded stretch and it's
just overall better so give that a shot
two more
[Music]

slow slow
perfect
you feel ready all right
