hey there it's been a while
what i wanted to discuss today is
give you a little show recap
so i've updated people on instagram
about how the show went but i haven't
really done the same for youtube i'll
start with the day before the show
because that's when i sort of started
preparing for it
really
the day before the show
the show took place on sunday the 31st
of october day before the show in the
morning
got up went to the gym had a pump
session the goal of which was to
enhance muscle glycogen storage
so essentially by performing a few sets
of fairly high repetitions for most body
parts
you
burn muscle glycogen which then
enhances muscle glycogen re-synthesis
following it and overall makes you look
a bit fuller than you would if you just
didn't train at all
so that's first thing
then i got back from the gym packed my
stuff
got ready to go
drove to
birmingham
and had some rice cakes my nutrition was
essentially just
higher carbs than usual
low fats low fiber
pretty calorie dense foods so as to not
have too much food in my stomach
uh some protein shakes
and that was about it
so we drove birmingham
got there
um with my girlfriend
and
we
i made a bit of a mistake i drove to a
wrong hotel
and so then i was late for my
appointment to the tanning session and
for hotel check-in
so that was quite stressful which wasn't
ideal um
in my defense there were two hotels
called the same thing in birmingham
with the exception of their location
um one was called hilton garden in
airport and most called hilton gordon in
i would say brimley place
and because google maps operates on
a system where you just put in you know
the first few ads and you can click the
option
i didn't pay attention and i drove
through a hotel
and then i had to rush to the second one
to get there roughly on time
so we got to the second hotel on time
not really like 10 15 minutes late and
turns out it didn't actually matter
whether i was in time or not because i
had to wait for an hour to get 10
anyways beyond my appointment time which
you know
not ideal but
i just waited around
had some water had some monster
and finally i got some footage with a
friend of mine jacques who helped get
some
videos of the show of my thoughts and
everything
so that'll be uploaded so today as well
um
but yeah
got my first tanning session done which
was a very strange experience because
you're stood in a room with naked men
who are all very tired looking
and have a sock on their genitalia
and usually stand around and the music
they picked was
an interesting choice it was sort of
like 90s
electro pop synth sort of thing
which didn't
enhance the atmosphere in any way
um
or make it any better
so
that was a fast heading session
i met a few
competitors that
which was nice
there was a real range of people at the
show and this tanning and everything
from people who were very friendly who
wanted to talk and
clearly wanted to talk to people and
get the most out of the experience
almost
to some people who were headphones in um
eating off top wire
would give you like sort of dirty look
if you looked at them
and yeah i get both perspectives but
there was a real range
and i think when people say oh
you know bollywood's backstage are
really friendly and you'll make lots of
friends and stuff yeah that can be true
if you approach it the right way um but
i think
people don't mention the range of people
that actually compete in bodybuilding
and how they act
but yeah first hanging session was done
then i went up to my hotel room i got my
final posing session done
which was really easy posing just
getting some repetitions in
i'll be honest in the lead-up to the
show i wasn't really nervous about
stepping on stage or any of that stuff i
was nervous about
being ready as far as conditioning or
leanness went
and muscularity posing not so much
wilkinson
but whether or not i was lean enough and
muscular enough those two were my main
sort of
points of anxiety i guess after posing
in the hotel room i went for a walk with
my girlfriend to get my steps in because
i didn't want to have to adjust calories
for reduced steps so i just kept my
steps the same
to reduce the amount of variables that i
had to account for and play with
in the lead up to the show
did my steps came back
basically relaxed for the rest of the
evening for a few hours
around 10 p.m 10 30
i was feeling i was feeling extremely
sleepy and so i went to bed quite early
and so i woke up quite early i woke up
around
i want to say like 6 00 am 7 a.m i got
up i i couldn't shower anything or brush
my i brushed my teeth but i had to be
careful because once you have your first
tan layer on or coat of tan
you're supposed to make sure it doesn't
get wet because otherwise it wears off
and that's not good
so got up
made sure i looked somewhat presentable
um
went downstairs into the hotel lobby had
some rice cakes
and some salt and stuff like that um
and then i head into the show venue the
crescent theater
to
get my second layer of tan to register
for the show and everything like that
so i walked there it was raining which
was ideal because i had my first
tan layer on
but i got there
headed downstairs got my second layer of
tan on
uh went upstairs
got registered for the show
and then i
hung out backstage with steve hall
and pascal floor and jess from revive
stronger as well honestly throughout the
whole show i met so many people that i
couldn't really name them all
so you'll sort of have to take my word
for it
but i met a lot of people
um
a lot of my friends came to support as
well my girlfriend came so her family
came
some of my friends came to support and
it was a great day um
one of my clients came as well a few of
my clients actually
and that was really nice i enjoyed
meeting people
anyways back to
backstage so after my second time later
and
getting registered i headed downstairs i
was second to last class
men's
open tall bodybuilding to appear on
stage
the show was split into
pre-judging in the morning and posing
routines in the evening
quarter to noon ish
i stepped on stage for pre-judging
at this point i'd seen my competitors
because we were backstage pumping up um
getting ready and so forth
having seen some of them
i knew i wasn't gonna place well they
were
either bigger and or leaner than me and
so
i was like okay i'm not gonna do very
well here and that was fine because i
didn't really enter the show to win or
place well in the first place
i could have entered the novice division
or the junior division
but i chose to just enter the
men's tall open bodybuilding division
because i mostly care about the
experience of
getting ready to compete and actually
stepping on stage not so much about
whether i got second third fifth seventh
place
and so what wound up happening is there
were five people in my class
um and during pre-judging
everything went well i wasn't
particularly neither stepping on stage
or posing even
there was an issue initially
where
the music was quite loud in the venue
like while i was on stage and the
judge's voice was quite
quiet
and so it's hard to hear what they were
saying and so initially
when we started posing i was a bit
confused and even later on there was a
moment where i didn't know what the [ __ ]
was going on
um
but overall pre-drinking went well i
didn't feel very nervous
again the only thing i was nervous about
was oh do i look like a belong head
basically and yeah so pre-training
happened i got off stage i
hung out with friends
and my girlfriend for
around an hour
i had some coffee i had some more carbs
and then i headed back to the venue to
get ready for the posing routine which
turned out to be way later than we
thought
the show was
reasonably well organized it wasn't
ideal like
it wasn't terrible but the timings were
a bit unpredictable
uh the sign posting and even the
information was a bit
unreliable at times um
so it wasn't ideal
anyways i headed backstage to get ready
for the posing routine section of the
show spent some more time hanging out
with
friends with some competitors backstage
talked to them and stuff
and that was nice
it came time for the posing routine i
was the last in my class to step on
stage for the posing routine
did my routine which i'll put up on
screen now
[Music]
wow
[Music]
[Music]
wow
wow
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank
for my closing routine i really just
selected a song that was easy to match
to
so it was a fairly generic trap song
with this thing sort of a distinct beat
i guess
that was easy to match to so each post
could be hit to the beat then i selected
pose that i thought
suited me fairly well and made sure that
you were moving smoothly from
front to side from side to rear from
rear to side from
side to front and not for example from
front to rear because that requires a
lot of movement and not very smooth
transitioning usually did my routine
and then they gave out awards straight
away you know
be second fast it was okay on my fourth
fifth and eventually i found out oh
i was fifth out of five
which
i was slightly supported by
but at the same time i saw it coming
and again i didn't compete to win or to
place or anything like that so
i didn't mind too much the other
competitors were between 25 and 40 years
old
they competed several times that season
and in the past few years
so i didn't i didn't think too much of
it
but with that being said i was somewhat
disappointed with the look i brought on
stage like on one hand it was the best i
could have done because
i don't think i slacked during homeless
prep like i did my best um but i just
wasn't as lean or
muscular as the other competitors and so
part of me was a bit disappointed with
how i looked by comparison
then after the awards i could have
stayed around for feedback for judge
feedback
but i was assured by several members of
staff
and
via messages and everything
that they would be feedback individual
feedback sent
by a volunteer after the show by email
and so i didn't want to have all my
friends and
girlfriend wait around for even more
time i already felt bad because
i appeared on stage for like
5-10 minutes total on that day and they
waited around for five to ten hours so
i felt quite bad for that already and i
didn't want to have them wait even more
and so i decided okay i'll just get the
feedback by email and i'll leave the
venue now we left the venue we went to
five guys and it was nice
that about wraps up the show itself
honestly
it's about the result i expected for the
experience to become a better athlete a
better coach
to decide whether or not i actually
enjoyed bodybuilding or not and yeah i
got that out of it so as far as that's
concerned the experience was definitely
a success now what are my thoughts on
bodybuilding
competitions themselves
for me specifically
i didn't enjoy competing in bodybuilding
as much as powerlifting the contest prep
itself was really draining overall and
not something i'd
want to do often because of how negative
of an impact it had on
my life as a whole
and so
power of thing is definitely a sport
i'll compete in more frequently than
bodybuilding both because it's easier to
prepare for as far as how much of a
strain it places on your life
and because i just enjoyed it more
but i think training for
muscle growth is something i enjoy a lot
and so that'll definitely be where my
main offseason focus is
as far as what my offseason is going to
look like now
briefly
the judges sent out feedback but that
turned out to be literally
uh the score sheet
so it would just tell you how close you
were to other competitors in rankings
but it wouldn't tell you anything about
weak points we could improve on or any
of that stuff
and so
i asked some friends and some fellow
competitors about their opinions and to
make a long story short my back
especially
needs a lot of work
but my upper body as a whole needs work
um
lower body size wise
i was pretty good um i was probably
above average in my class in terms of
size lower body wise but overall
conditioning wasn't as good
upper body size wasn't as good
especially my back my back was
much more of a lagging area than i would
have thought
compared to my competitors
and so for this upcoming offseason
the goal is to
[Music]
gain muscle
everywhere
but spend some time specializing on
microbiota specifically
so for these first few masking blocks
i'll be doing
i'll be spending some time on
specializing on my chest back and arms
and then afterwards we'll see reevaluate
what my weak points are
and go from there
that wraps up my show experience i'll be
going through some questions that i
received on instagram it is currently
the 7th of november so
exactly a week after my comp
first question would be
how many calories did you eat the week
post prep
so fortunately it's not exactly a week
and
to make a long story short i haven't
restricted my diet much at all
i've eaten
what i wanted and largely in the amounts
that i wanted
um
because it was my first competition and
i don't plan on competing again for a
long long time
and by a long time i mean three to ten
years that's with time
range i think
um
there was really no reason for me to
stay lean
in the short term
and
lifestyle wise
and also just progress wise i think
getting back to a comfortable body fat
makes sense
as quickly as possible
so
for me i was experiencing a lot of
things from a lot of hunger to pre-low
energy
to rest move to
food focus to body mission sounds a lot
of that stuff
when i was stage lean
and so it made sense for me to just
regain body fat pretty quickly now i
would say in the first 24 hours after my
show i probably had at least 20 000
calories like i did not control my
intake much
likewise
it's become more
moderate now
but essentially it started off around
you know 20 000 plus calories on the
first day then maybe like somewhere
between 10 20 000 on the second day then
more towards 10 000 on a third and so
forth now to the point where i'm
consistently between like four and eight
thousand calories i think per day
um which is still quite high by all
means
but it's also meant that
i've regained a lot of weight and i have
felt a lot better now than i did a week
ago namely
i
don't have as much of a fruit folks
anymore like i'm actually
capable of imagining being satiated now
which i wasn't really
initially um
i
what is a key
okay you're kind of ruining the vibe
here
you realize that right
there's a cat in the background
and it's
it should be very distracting
um
but yeah so
during this week of eating a lot more
food
a lot of things have come back to normal
from
not entirely to normal but
close to normal again
what is a kitty from my hunger being a
lot manageable to my energy levels being
a lot better um
[Music]
to my mood being a lot better just a lot
of things have gotten better
um would i say i'm back to normal yet no
not quite but i'm also
doing a lot better than i was a week ago
um
i think the reason i was
so hungry
post-show
was three-fold
um first one would be just you know
contest prep makes you very hungry
because you're dieting for a long time
the second one is i
was consistently having between four and
six hundred milligrams of caffeine a day
for the duration of
the last like 10-12 weeks
um and also i started taking nicotine
around a month before the show
and i came off caffeine nicotine
entirely called turkey as soon as the
show ended
and
yeah i think when you combined that with
the
extra hunger from
cordless prep it just meant that i was
i could eat you know so yeah to answer
your question
how many calories did you eat did your
week post prep
i had around
20 plus thousand calories on the first
day
then the following days it sort of
tapered down more towards
four to eight thousand calories per day
um over time
and now i'm at a point where with 48 000
calories per day of pre-nutritious
sources like more fibrous
uh lower caloric density that sort of
thing i can be pretty full all right the
second question is
anything you do differently next time
around yeah definitely first of all i
was not sufficiently lean for this show
so when you compare me to my competitors
in the
men's open
tall bodybuilding class a lot of them
were just simply a lot leaner than i was
next time i would either start the prep
diet at a lower body fat percentage
or i would
have
more time spent dieting just so i could
actually get into proper stage condition
now i wasn't
wildly out of shape but i definitely
wasn't as lean as i could have been
which as a first-time competitor is
always hard to really
know how far you should push
how far you can push and so forth
honestly that's the main thing
everything else was done pretty well
i think with more experience qantas
prepping i can hopefully
attenuate some of the bad stuff that
comes with it like for example worse
mood
a strained
strained
interpersonal relationship life i guess
um
but i think the main thing would just be
to start dieting earlier which will
start diet leaner
so that i can be
i can step on stage with a better
condition
one final thing would be
on my stage pictures and on my later
contest prep pictures
you can see the way i flex my glutes is
to sort of um
on my rear little bicep and rear lateral
poses
that i sort of squeeze them together all
the way
and
that was one way that people recommend
you do it
but in hindsight i do think the
more bikini
bikini-style way star way bikini way of
posing
your glutes for those poses suits me
better which is when you don't fully
squeeze them together and you sort of
flare them a little bit almost
and so in hindsight i think that would
have made a
that would have made for better posing
on stage fundamentally the judge
feedback i got on it that i was
i like conditioning i liked muscle size
and lacked posing ability
it's kind of true you know um i think
for next show
the main things are really just going to
be posed better
be more muscular and be leaner and so
getting more muscular that's going to
take time getting leaner i just
addressed that and posing-wise i don't
think there's much
i need to improve on
next up how did you shred so much was it
purely a deficit so yeah pretty much
obviously there was some nutritional
peaking involved and some training
peaking involved for looking my best at
the show
but by and large like 95 plus percent of
everything was just being a deficit
lifting weights
trying to retain muscle mass and so
forth
next i got some comments saying i just
want to congratulate you it was awesome
and
apparently those front poses suit me
very well
and that my lats and torso make a really
nice taper
and it flows and it shows from the front
thank you i appreciate that if i have to
say
at this show at least my rear poses were
my weakest
by far
my
side poses may have been my strongest
and
it was close with my front poses
but my conditioning in my back and my
sides of my back specifically
were i think probably my weakest area
next question how is five guys so this
is from one of my clients
uh two whom i mentioned that i went to
five guys after my show
yeah five guys was great i'll put up
some pictures if i have some i got a
bacon cheeseburger
and
a hot dog and then i had
large
cajun fries cajun cajun i don't really
know
um
and two milkshakes and that was
a good start let's see because
afterwards i went back to the hotel room
and had a million snacks um
i did some pretty unholy things i had
four donuts four muffins
uh
[Music]
like a bag of crisps
uh some
chocolate it's just a variety of things
that i can't recall at this point but i
had a lot of food and five guys was
amazing i'd only had five guys like
twice before then
so it was
very good and i've actually been
one more time since um out to five guys
after the show so
yeah five guys was great
all right next i got several questions
about the hardest part of prep
uh so what was your horsepower prep what
did you find hardest about the prep and
the best and the worst part of prep
so first i'll answer what was the
hardest part
honestly
a lot
honestly at different stages of prep
different things with the hardest
towards the very end of prep like last
few weeks the hardest thing was probably
training
just because
i felt very vulnerable
like when you're
pretty lean and yourself to train hard
to retain muscle mass
and
[Music]
your
calorie intake is very low and you feel
low on energy and everything
you feel pretty vulnerable and you feel
like
you might get injured pretty easily
and so during those last few weeks
training was making me very anxious like
i would get
anxious about every session um
and actually did get a couple injuries
small injuries uh towards like the last
two weeks of prep
and so honestly last few weeks of prep i
would say definitely
the training
before that i would say
probably in like the last five weeks or
so
of course
excluding the last two weeks but maybe
the three to five weeks before that
getting my cardio in so that would be
all the steps and stuff
um
when you're low energy the last thing
you want to do is get up and walk for
two and a half hours every day
so that was hard um
and then in general before that i think
probably the hunger um
towards the end of contest prep hunger
was bad but it wasn't the worst of it
um
hunger was bad
throughout the first well throughout the
last like few months but towards the
very end of it it wasn't that bad
overall though honestly i would say
not so much any specific aspect of prep
like the cardio the training the
nutrition the hunger what have you
but more so
the side effects that came with it so
you know whilst mood decreased
libido the less sleep the increased food
focus the
decreased focus in general the
increased concern about body image or
how your body looks the sort of reduced
sociability you can have because
obviously if you're hundreds prepping
you go to your steps you go do your
training you can't eat this you can't
eat that and so
you can't be associable by any means and
so yeah all the side effects were by far
the hardest part and i still feel as
though bodybuilding contest prep
unless you're really good at matching it
or you're a lucky person who hasn't
experienced those effects as much
is really a selfish endeavor and it can
impact your life overall and your
relationships other people quite a lot
so
yeah i say the side effects of prep
overall were probably the hardest part
of prep
now next question the best and the worst
part of prep
worst part as i just said i'd say
the side effects as far as mood libido
focus food focus body image
how sociable you're able to be with
other people the impact it has on
relationships
um all that stuff is easily the last
part um the hunger see
honestly the fatigue is pretty bad too
like you just feel low energy
but i think like the hunger
the training and cardio
they're bad but i think those can be
sort
of overlooked but then i think the
impact it has on your life overall
that's
really where i didn't like it much the
best part of prep i'd say there's a few
things the first one would be the first
few months of prep for the last few
weeks depending on how lean you are when
you start and so forth those are
actually quite enjoyable because
you're not so low in body fat on
calories or you haven't been dying for
so long that it's unpleasant and so it's
actually quite pleasant to start the
diet loosen body fat look great
and it's not very hard
that's the first thing the second thing
would be the structure it gives you
so if you can make it work
context prep can give you a lot of
structure in your life which then can
enable you to do some good work
elsewhere now admittedly towards the end
of prep that structure doesn't do much
because you're so tired and dead
that
you rarely get your best work done
anyways
but it can still be helpful
and then
finally getting to your
leanest physique ever
it's kind of cool because you realize oh
this is how i look when i'm stage lean
and that's
it's nice um it's a fun experience as
far as that's concerned so
i think those three things would be the
best part of prep
next up how does it feel to have a
strided ass when sitting on a chair
honestly towards the end of prep
sitting down is amazing like
i never felt so happy sitting down as i
did when i was like a few weeks out from
the show
and i just came back from doing a
training session i got all my steps done
i would sit down have a meal and that
was beautiful like that was
sitting down feels amazing um
like i would have to take breaks during
walks sometimes just to
get my breath back and not feel
lightheaded
so sitting down during prep actually
feels quite nice um
lying down not so much because it can be
hard to get back up afterwards
but sitting down that can be quite nice
did you take diuretics if yes how many
days no i didn't take diuretics i think
for naturals at least
most of the time probably not
recommended
it probably has more of a potential
downside
than a potential benefit for your
physique
and it's not really something i'm
particularly well-versed in um so it
wasn't something that i played around
with and i wouldn't recommend it for
other people
either unless you really know what
you're doing um
but if you do you probably won't do it
in the first place for enhanced athletes
i honestly don't know i know that peds
can
mess with water retention and water
storage a little bit and so that can
potentially be something to use
but at the same time again i'd only use
it if you were quite knowledgeable about
it
final question
would you try to keep your body fat
percentage low after the show
well
no basically
i'll explain why not
first up i'm not competing again for a
while uh for
i don't wanna put any hard numbers on it
but three to ten years that sort of
range
um a lot of my competitors in this show
were between 25 and 40
and
to build an appreciable amount of muscle
mass
that's probably
how it's going to take me so first thing
is
i'm not going to keep my body fat
percentage low after a show because i'm
not planning competing for a while
the second thing would be
i
do not
function well at that body fat like i
function pretty well around around 8 to
25 body fat that's the sort of range i
operate within pretty well
much below eight percent and it's not
good
and much above 25 percent and i look
terrible and
my health gets
meaningfully worse
so i think between 8 and 25 is where i
feel my best
it's also where i progress my best it's
where i feel invest it's where i
progress my best
i've also realized that
usually maintaining strength and muscle
mass while cutting down in body fat it's
pretty easy until you get around
eight to 12 percent usually
and so if your offseason goal is to
maximize muscle mass gains and
strength gains
and i kind of think it makes sense for
men
to
[Music]
bulk up as high as they're comfortably
able to as far as health and preferences
and aesthetics and everything is
concerned
and then
cut back down to that body fat below
which
cutting down becomes detrimental to
muscle retention or strength
and that sort of repeats the process and
so for me because that range is sort of
like 8 to 25
ish
aim is basically going to be to
stay with that range um
start at the bottom
half of that range
get up to the top and that range cut
down repeat
repeat repeat repeat repeat
until i'm in a position where i've
gained a lot of muscle mass
and i'm ready to compete again in
bodybuilding i will likely compete in
palliating first before i compete in
bodybuilding again
competing palleting
is a little bit more fun to me i think
and also
it is
incomparably less
strainful
on your lifestyle as a whole so
long story short no i'm not going to try
and keep my body fat percentage low
after this show
i ran
what's essentially a very uncontrolled
recovery diet wherein i
ate what i needed to eat and the week
after the show like with mineral
restriction
and i went from
i want to say my seven-day average
weigh-in before this show was around
91-ish kilograms so that's around 202
pounds
and then now my average is
around like 96.97 so i gained
somewhere between like
five and 20 pounds not five ten and
twenty pounds or five and ten kilograms
maybe a bit less
uh over the course of around
um a week
and
after i get back in that comfortable
body fat range and my hunger and mood
etc stabilize and normalize again
the plan is to
initiate a slow blocking phase by slow i
mean
gain one to two percent of body weight a
month
um
until my body fat gets quite high in
that range
and then cut back down and repeat the
process
until i'm
looking to compete in either power of
thing or bodybuilding if i compete in
powerlifting i'll probably compete as a
105 initially
so that's 105 kilograms or 231 pounds
and then eventually probably compete as
a
120 kilogram power though or 262 pounds
i believe
but yeah so no plans to keep voice
representation low after the show
yeah that's basically it
all right those are all the questions i
had
so
if you enjoyed the video
please
comment like subscribe going forwards
now i'll make videos that are a bit more
short and production heavy
and they'll also be less frequent
to be honest there's a few reasons for
this at this point i don't think
i feel like recording
my training in the gym as much anymore
it's been
it was fine during prep but it's also
been very burdensome as far as oh making
sure you have a tripod setting it up for
every set and so forth
and also i don't think
those videos were as helpful to people
as i might have expected them or hope
them to be and so i think i'm gonna make
some more
short content um
that's a bit more production heavy
and that doesn't require me to record
myself every set in the gym
um
so yeah this was probably the last sort
of
longer video that i'll make for a while
the next videos will be a bit more short
production heavy and hopefully
informative
but yeah if you enjoyed this video
please comment like subscribe and keep
an eye out for the videos to come i
appreciate it have a great day
