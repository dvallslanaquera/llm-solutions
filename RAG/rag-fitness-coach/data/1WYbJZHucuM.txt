hey folks it's me Dr Mike for
Renaissance periodization and on today's
BS series we attack the idea that
artificial sweeteners can make you gain
weight
people say it all the time I stay away
from that fake sugar man cause it gonna
make me fat and then I ain't gonna fit
into my truck
Southerners I'm deeply apologetic for
laughing at your expense but really it's
not your expense your Southern is
generally cool as fuck and they're good
with people trying on a good old
southern accent let me know how I did I
have way more things to say in southern
if you approve of my accent in the
comments hey bud I'll tell you what
it's really not Southerners that's
unfair
I was going to say another term but
YouTube YouTube will flag us won't they
Scott the video guy
you know what I'm saying
anyway
the idea that artificial sweeteners make
you gain weight and get really fat
is supported by one kind of study and
that's called a correlational study
so they take a whole bunch of people
and they ask them or measure somehow how
much artificial sweetener intake like
for example diet soda that they have in
their diet
and they find time and time again that
fatter people
consume an average of more artificial
sweeteners than people who are not
remotely fat and are quite lean in a
very good shape
and then people take this and because
people
hate artificial sweeteners already
anyway and that's called the argument
from nature fallacy or the naturalistic
fallacy depending on your choice of
words
and they already have that built in so
they go and run and say see I told you I
told you these things are making us fat
big food and big Pharma selling you the
things that make you fat and then
selling you the medicines man they keep
you addicted to Pharma man
thank you
man
anyway that's generally how the
conversation goes
and it is right as far as it goes
because fatter people do on average
consume more artificial sweeteners
but correlation does not equal causation
it can
but often does not it's just not
reliable
for example
you will notice that the vast majority
of people who have broken legs have
casts on but if we were to say you know
I think this caste structure is breaking
people's legs
that would be a curious conclusion and
insanely entirely wrong
because the cast is something that after
you get the broken leg you put on there
to make the broken leg better
just like maybe just maybe
people who have discovered that through
other poor eating habits and lack of
physical activity they have become
overweight may think how can I help this
condition of being overweight aha I'll
have artificial sweeteners I'll have a
Diet Coke instead of a regular Coke
and at least for some time while they're
doing this they are still overweight and
some of them replace some things with
diet they have more diet products but
they also have just more regular food
those people that go to McDonald's
and they start ordering and they're like
um I have a Diet Coke and the person
behind the counter is like ha a health
nut I gotcha and they get ready to press
the button this is the salad thing about
it they're gonna order the salad next
they're like
five fry orders extra large extra salt
10 cheeseburgers
27 piece chicken nugget like sir that's
not that's nothing it's just 20 piece
nuggets we can give you two of those
like no I want 27 nuggets I'm gonna get
out of my car and bad things will happen
do you understand and you're like Jesus
yes yes absolutely we'll put 27 exactly
nuggets in there and they're like oh and
um and a Frosty
sir this is a McDonald's
Frosty is a Wendy's product
and the response is of course if I have
to get out of this car
Frosty it is all for the customer
in the end a lot of people who have the
diet products who are also overweight
just consume a crapload of other food
too they continue to stay on the fatter
side of things not a moral judgment
that's just truth and they also consume
lots of diet products so when we do the
meta studies and it shows like I want
more fat people consumer diet products
it really just doesn't prove to us at
all that the diet products are
contributing to obesity but because we
are scientific and open-minded on this
channel maybe there's some kind of
mechanism through which
diet products could artificial
sweeteners could somehow contribute to
increased obesity
Maybe
but it turns out scientists have looked
into pretty much all of the known
candidate mechanisms and have come up
with to quote my colleague Dr James
Hoffman diddly dick
for example
sweeteners do not seem to mess reliably
or on a very large magnitude with
insulin secretion so that one's out
most of them don't really measurably
mess with gut bacteria
they do for a little while and the
bacteria goes back to normal
and in fact the natural sweetener uh
Stevia stevia whenever I say Stevia I
feel like I'm just talking to a guy
named Steve
uh and actually the national one messes
with it more so I was curious there
but the gut bacteria certainly doesn't
explain the Obesity
uh and we could speculate all up to the
moon and back about how this mechanism
works of course we're presupposing
there's a mechanism because remember it
could just be correlation it could just
be likely is that fatter people just
have more diet products in the same way
that people with broken legs get casts
trying to fix the problem
how can we figure out if this really is
a thing well we do the gold standard of
scientific evidence the randomized
control trial otherwise known as RCT
you really want to serve some science up
to somebody and you're in a debate you
print up double bound rcts and throw it
at people as hard as you can that shit
will do some damage some shit's thick
make sure you include all the references
because it thickens up the stack in any
case randomized control trials is when
we take people and they enroll in the
trial and we split them up into two
groups potentially this is how a trial
could look
we
say hey both of you folks
have to have the same diet and we're
going to monitor your diet make sure
you're doing a good job
and we're gonna feed one group of folks
a sweetened beverage that is sweetened
with real sugar has really calories
and another group we're going to give
you a beverage you know twice a day or
something three times a day that has
artificial sweetener and actually
doesn't have any calories
but we're not going to tell you which
one is which and you'll have no idea
which group you're in
randomized because we pick the people at
random to make sure
there's nobody self-selecting into
groups and biasing us
and we go in and we do that
we observe them for two to four months
and we see how the result uh is shown in
their weight and their body fat
and most of the time
the weight loss that you get
from the artificial sweetener group is
exactly the same weight loss as if you
took that sugar water and replaced it
with just water
and nearly unanimously
artificial sweeteners do not cause
weight gain like the sugar water does
and almost always they cause weight loss
because how could they not
take out zero calories
you drink it nothing happens your body's
like what the fuck where's my food fuck
I gotta go dinging through my own fat
stores and you lose fat and you lose
weight and it's great for your health
this is a direct test of the hypothesis
the idea
that you can get fatter by consuming
artificial sweeteners multiple times
pretty much all the times it has just
failed and it's not just failed it's
shown the opposite to be true that
people lose as much weight as you would
predict them to lose by replacing the
regular soda or regular orange juice
with water
if they replace it with diet soda or
diet orange juice I didn't have a good
clever thing to say about that that's
like probably tastes like Sunny D no
offense it's the worst thing on earth
remember when I came to America I moved
here from Russia a thousand years ago
and uh I had my first Sunny D and I
thought gee this is going to be a tasty
orange juice and I had a Gulp and I was
like
this is an industrial solvent
I'm gonna die I didn't die but uh I got
wise enough to never drink Sunny D again
and to the corporation that makes Sunny
D I'm deeply sorry I'm sure whatever you
guys do is awesome
this is not a thing
artificial sweeteners do not predictably
cause weight gain
they do not interfere with weight gain
they are essentially as far as weight
and body fat are concerned basically
inert
so the idea
that taking in artificial sweeteners is
better for you
than taking in regular sweeteners seems
right on
but the idea that regular sugar
doesn't make you fatter
or
regular sugar makes you fatter but
artificial sweeteners make you just as
fat or the artificial sweeteners make
you fatter than just consuming water
there's a term for that that idea what I
think Arnold said it once
bullshit yay and that last part is
critical because if you're going to do a
good Arnold impression every now and
again a random Arnold noise has to be
included
one of my favorite people of all time a
science teacher that sort of mentored me
in high school
um he's like why doesn't Arnold ever say
ouch when he gets hurt every time he
gets hurt in a movie like he had a
rocket you know a shot at him he goes
what is it that he's doing I don't want
to know I love it Arnold you're the man
you folks are all the man
um you know in a general sense
I've said enough possibly too much see
you next time
