instead of doing leg extensions try
doing excessive squats or reverse Nordic
curls light extensions are helpful
because they allow you to isolate the
quad and direct this for more
specifically which otherwise doesn't get
that much love however the light
extension trains the quadriceps at very
short muscle lengths Recent research has
informed us regarding the importance of
lower muscle lengths during training
enter the city Squat and the reverse
Nordic curl both of these exercises
lengthen the quadriceps very well and
make the bottom position quite
challenging give them a shot and let me
know what you think
