hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's video topic
is fine tuning your training frequency
for muscle growth how do we do it first
we're going to talk about what generally
a good frequency looks like because
you could be thinking are we gonna train
like eight times a week for the same
muscle group or we're gonna train once a
week
maybe somewhere between those then we're
gonna talk about just the theoretical
trade-offs of doing a higher frequency
versus doing a lower frequency and
seeing sort of how it balances out
then we're gonna talk about how to
examine your current training frequency
to see sort of maybe if it's just right
or maybe if we could experiment nudging
it up or not you get down
based on what you're getting out of your
training then we're going to talk about
how to potentially reduce your frequency
and measure results how to increase your
frequency and measure results
and lastly we'll touch on a more
advanced topic of frequency
periodization just an idea throughout
there
see if you guys are keen on it as they
say in australia
i missed that place covid destroyed
australia
as far as i'm concerned because i can't
get on a plane and go there in any case
what does good frequency look like
because there are some frequencies
that are not us the most good idea so
number one you should be able to train
hard on each session
if your frequency is so high that you're
always beat up
and you're just surviving training
you're like oh man training quads today
sucks i trained him yesterday
i'm still sore and tired guess i'm just
gonna have a light workout
it's sort of like why are we in the gym
we know that
really hard workouts especially probably
as you get more advanced
are really the only workouts that work
the best so if you have a ton of easy
workouts that's good for strength and
good for technical development
not ideal fire per trophy so you should
be able to train hard every time you go
in
and generally speaking if you
are training uh super super frequently
you may not be able to train very hard
any time that's not a good idea
if you are training really infrequently
let's say once a week or
gee once every two weeks or something
crazy like that
then you might have to train so hard
that you are causing more damage
than you are growth stimulus and then
your recovery from workout is really
just that
just recovery and not adaptation so it
is possible to train so infrequently
that your attempt to train hard to cover
all the time you're not training anymore
which is to say the rest of the time
is a bit outlandish and it doesn't end
up working super well for you like
what if you decide to leave it's
actually an interesting analogy i think
i think it works on technical grounds
if you decide to leave right on time
to get into the the city to go you know
to some
let's say restaurant with your friends
and the drive is an hour long
if you leave right when the drive starts
an hour before you're supposed to be
there
it's great no rush everything's really
good if
on the other hand and this is to the
effect of like the too much damage
from trying to sort of make up time for
lost frequency
if you're training infrequently you may
want to train so hard at any one time
that you cause excess damage you don't
actually accomplish your goal of max
hypertrophy
just the same way if you wait until
you're you know 30 seconds away
from the actual time you're meeting up
with your friends and you have you know
an hour's drive to do
hypothetically could you get into a
rocket and have it launch you over there
yes but the g-forces would kill you and
the rocket would probably blow up
something really goes that fast so well
anyway they can keep you alive
so just the same way if you're like man
i'm gonna train my quads you know once
every week and a half but i'm going to
train them real
hard well the level of hard you'd have
to train them to cover all that base
hypertrophy wise can't actually happen
because if you train so hard in a
certain given session
you do so much damage it ends up being
mostly an exercise in recovery
rather than when an adaptation how much
volume
is that you know how much volume is uh
not enough to really cause a robust
stimulus or too much to recover from
generally speaking
if you and this is a very big range but
at least it cuts off some extreme stuff
if you're doing any fewer than three
working sets per muscle group per
session
uh you could probably be doing more as
long as you showed up to the gym you
might as well do more it'll probably
cause a
better stimulus and then on the other
end if you're doing much more much more
a little bit more is fine much more than
10 sets per muscle group per session so
if you're like 16th set of chest
you're probably better off splitting it
up into 8 and 8 rather than doing 16 all
at the same time so give that some
thought
next you should be able to so first you
should be able to train hard on each
session if you're so tired you can't
train hard or you have to train super
psychotically hard all the time
it's no good second you should be able
to recover between sessions right
and that's a big part of that is
training hard another one is just at a
biochemical level if you're not
very recovered then your muscle is more
resistant to initiating hypertrophy all
right
so if you are still sore and still super
weak and you train again you just don't
get a big bump in hypertrophy signaling
you just don't so you're kind of like
training and you're
spending time really you're wasting it
because you're just not getting the
message through nearly as well as you
should
so you should be able to recover uh
which probably means you shouldn't have
delayed outside soreness and you should
also feel relatively strong
once recovered you shouldn't be waiting
too long to train so sometimes i ask
people
how often do you train chest and i say
once a week i say okay do you train
usually what chest
on monday how did i guess they're like
yeah a monday chest when is your chest
no longer sore they're like yeah usually
by thursday it's fine like i got you
when do you really feel strong in your
pushing muscles and you feel like you
could actually hit some pr's
they're like yeah like like friday for
sure i got you so
when do you train chest next is it
friday they're like no it's monday
so what's happening at least friday
saturday sunday they're like
nothing like i got you so you could be
growing then but you're not
they're like uh yeah i guess i shouldn't
think of it that way
so time spent dilly-dallying around when
your muscles are already ready to go and
have a high quality workout
gee you know that's time you could have
spent getting better and that it really
is like that because
the weak is an arbitrary human-designed
notion
or idea and your human body doesn't
really work on a week
right it could be that if you have you
know super long time skills for recovery
some champion bench pressure is only
bench press heavy for strength
once every like uh nine or ten days
because they just not ready to bench
heavy every week other folks that are
really small and
have smaller muscles and recover really
quickly can do hard chest training four
or five days a week because after
one or two days they're just completely
recovered and there's no point in
waiting anymore
so once you're recovered you shouldn't
be waiting too long to train and if you
are
maybe your frequency needs some
adjustment and then
just as a sort of note for you to keep
you know in
kind of in your knowledge base for
sanity the most of the best results
usually come from training
a muscle group not total training days a
week a different video for that
between two and four times per week that
doesn't mean
three is the magic number that's the
optimal it varies on a bunch of
different conditions in some cases one
time a week is better
in other rare cases five and six time a
week training for the same muscle is
better but generally speaking two to
four times a week is a really
good thing but that's only if the above
three conditions are met and if they're
not it might be something outside
of that two to four times per week right
waiting uh
much more than this amount of time
or much less than this amount of time
essentially training once a week when
you can recover from more
or training five times a week when you
clearly can't recover and you clearly
can't get good workouts
is probably just not a good idea on just
base logic so
within those constraints as long as
we're making those checklists
multiple frequencies may work and they
may work equivalently or roughly
equivalently
two to four times per week i'll put it
this way if someone comes to me and
they're like hey
i train my biceps and they say anything
between two and four times a week
and i say i trade my biceps two times a
week or they say three or they say four
and i'm concerned my frequency is not
optimal and i'm concerned it's holding
back
my strength or my hypertrophy i'm
actually at that point
not so curious about the frequency i am
but not so much i need to make sure to
do another shit right i'm more concerned
about their nutrition i'm more concerned
about their exercise execution their
fatigue management all this other stuff
because if you're in the two to four
times per week range man you know
you're getting real good results very
close to the best possible results you
can get
not the best but pretty close so if
you're just not growing at all you hit
this major plateau
and you're thinking fuck it's a
frequency thing i know it is but you're
training like two to four times a week
already
uh man it's it's it alternating
frequency probably won't get you
very far however it can change things at
the margins and since we're here for
optimal hypertrophy let's talk about
how to get ideal frequency or a little
bit closer than we can right
trade-offs if you choose to go with a
slightly higher frequency
you can expect a few things to happen on
average first you actually can grow more
muscle in the short term this has been
very well confirmed by a bunch of
studies
two you'll probably beat up your joints
to connective tissues more in the short
term
so a bit of a downside three another
downside you probably have more systemic
fatigue
the reason for this is that if you train
with higher frequencies
you can actually increase your per week
volume a lot because you just have more
opportunities to train
it's kind of like if someone asked you
okay how much can you eat in one day and
you're like
a lot tons of calories i get but you
only get one meal like oh fuck i don't
know like
three or four thousand calories whatever
is in a pizza but after that i'm done
i know a bunch of you a mock people be
like oh you can eat ten pizzas sweet
you're the man but
in any case whatever your limit is if
you're only allowed to eat once in a day
let's say two hour feeding window
there's no way
that you can't eat more if we give you
two feeding windows or three or four
the the way you're going to eat the most
in a 24-hour period is if we just give
you that entire period train
so same thing with training volume if we
let you train
once a week you could do 40 sets but
only
10 of those or 12 will be high quality
if we let you do
twice a week training like up to 20 to
24 high quality sets
if we let you train four times a week
yeah maybe you can't do as many because
you can recover but you might be able to
do 30 or 40 high quality sets that
doesn't always mean you get more growth
but it sure as hell means you're going
to get more systemic fatigue so
definitely downside we need to know
you'll never uh see guys overreach as
bad
as if they're doing high frequency if
someone's training their quads four
times a week they can get into a hole
that's
unreal it's just unbelievable it's
impossible to imagine if you train quads
once a week
next if you are training like this
the consistent exposure of joints and
connective tissues
to loading increases the risk of injury
and
sort of wear and tear degradation over
time so it's actually best to use these
with higher reps and lower loads uh just
something to keep in mind if you're like
i'm gonna do
super high frequency fucking heavy well
those two might not be hyper compatible
or could god
hyper-compatible because as you may have
learned from the sort of examination of
bulgarian weight lifters
that's a weeder program that just shits
people out one way and the other way
most people don't make it through if
you're going heavy and high frequency
you're to get into some bullshit
if you do high frequency and at least
pepper in some light sessions you may be
able to survive it much better and thus
benefit
so in general higher frequency training
is more effective
but less sustainable in long run so just
know that because we're going to use
that later to strategize
now what about lower frequencies they
definitely grow
less muscle in the short term okay it's
just slower muscle growth
it's just a fact however they do beat up
your joints and connective tissue
significantly less than higher
frequencies
and they cause less systemic fatigue in
the short term
and they can be used through any variety
of rep ranges including very heavy if
you don't train very often you can go
heavy and your joints connective tissues
recover no problem for the next session
so it's less effective in any one unit
of time
but it's more sustainable which means
you get more time with it so as you can
tell there's not
really a clear like this one's better
it's different strokes for different
folks and it's
different strategies to use at different
times right
it's a similar analogy or an analogy
this would be like what's
what's better for warfare is it a
stealth bomber or a super advanced
submarine it's like it kind of just
depends on what you want to do
right and what the situation calls for
it's not one clear best just sort of
different tangents that we can go on
all right so we know theoretically what
frequency is all about how do you
examine your current frequency
and conclude sort of one of three things
one is my
current frequency seems to check all the
boxes everything's fine two i'm not
training often enough
or three i'm training too often and
maybe i need to back down
so before you change your frequency you
have to know
how good your current one is because
here's the deal
yours might be totally fine and this is
something i might address generally in a
video later much later but a lot of
times people with
very good programs are overly analytical
maybe not overly analytical i'll put
this better paranoid
and they think that they always have to
fine-tune like crazy
the thing is there's a trade-off between
fine-tuning and
actually training hard because anytime
you're fine-tuning you can train pretty
hard but you also have to observe the
process which means you can't go all out
and there's this also the psychological
problem of you're sort of always
doubting yourself which prevents you
from fully investing in a program
so a lot of folks will be sure
that the frequency is awful and they
need to update it some of you watching
this video
started watching this video because i
know it i know my frequency's off i've
known it my whole life
i've got to do something about this i've
got to find the optimal frequency after
you go through this checklist
you may actually be like oh my frequency
is totally fine and that's absolutely
the case for
tons of people maybe half the people
lifting watching this video
actually have a very awesome frequency
they don't need to change but in case
you do
let's examine are your workouts between
three
and ten sets per muscle per session on
average
if not fix that first okay fix that
first only then can you assess if your
frequency is optimal
because if you train very very low
frequency or sorry very low volume per
session or very high
a bunch of frequencies might be outright
incompatible for you and those might be
some of the best frequencies if you just
tailored your per session volume a
little better
next are you getting workouts of a high
quality so for example do you have good
energy coming into your workouts do you
get a really good tension and burn in
the muscles
do you get a pump after the set or sets
are over and is your local fatigue
really high like you finish your bicep
workout you're like holy shit i don't
even have biceps anymore you're like
everything's totally fine or do you have
low energy
poor mind muscle connection crappy pumps
and lots of systemic fatigue holding you
back
where it's not like locally my biceps
feel like shit it's like dude i can't do
it on a set of bicep curls like
i don't even want to pick up the weight
anymore like my mind is fried
and so there's the perceptive part and
the objective part the objective part is
are you able to progress
load from week to week with no
weaknesses or
or sorry no weakness or soreness holding
you back because if you can make those
progressions
that's great if you are getting poor
mind muscle connection if your systemic
fatigue is really high if you're not
able to progress so on and so forth
then a lot of the times your frequency
might be too high like you're literally
just trying to do too much
backing away might be better number
three
do your joints and connective tissues
get pretty messed up at the end of an
accumulation phase of a mesocycle
if they get really really messed up then
your frequency might be too high for
that given muscle group
not for sure but maybe if they don't
really get messed up and you're like i
feel like my joints are totally fine you
may be able to at least
benefit temporarily from a higher
frequency that will almost certainly
push your muscles
into a higher state of growth but will
definitely tax your joints more but
here's the thing if this is the maximum
your joints can take
and you're currently here in a mesocycle
maybe you can push it to here and be
totally fine
whereas if you're already here like if
your joints connective tissues
are killing you at the end of a month of
training
i'm not going to tell you to increase
your frequency that would be insane
because you will fall apart like
fucking mr potato head right on the
other hand if you feel totally fine
and i'm like hey how are your shoulders
doing like shoulder joints you're like
fucking golden i never have a problem
but i noticed you're only training
lateral raises or
side delts twice a week and you're
noticing that yeah they're not growing
all that well
man adding a session might be actually a
very logical thing because clearly your
joints connective tissues are not
holding you back in that case
and after you're no longer sore
from the last session and you feel
strong ask yourself how long you're
waiting until you train again
so if i ask you hey look how many sets
of chest are you doing you're like well
i do like an average of eight sets per
account i'm gonna check that seems fine
are your workouts of high quality you're
like yep great workouts all the stuff
checking all the boxes
do your joints and connective tissues
feel really messed up and you say well
you know like
towards the end of a mezzo they're like
a little beat up and i can't do much
more like okay chuck
probably not a good bandwidth there to
race frequency much more
and then i ask you like okay when you
train chest monday let's say chain
training monday and thursday
when you're training monday when are you
ready to go by and if you say like yeah
like wednesday night i'm feeling pretty
good and then thursday morning i fucking
can't wait to crush it and the same
thing sort of sunday night for that next
monday
there's nowhere to take your frequency
you could play around sort of
arbitrarily with a higher frequency and
just reduce the volume or a lower
frequency and raise the volume
but to be honest there's no there's no
imminent need for you to change the
frequency because
really nothing's wrong now if some of
these things are off then maybe your
frequency is either too high or too low
depending on how
you answer the questions so
if reducing your frequency
is in order how do you go about doing it
well it's a five step process
first you let's take whatever your
frequency is now no
let's say you train chester biceps
whatever chest and by substituting
goddamn muscles i talk about on this
channel always say like rhomboids you
know
you're training your muscle whatever
muscle it is three times a week
okay you go through the last slide this
is slide number four
you go through slide number three you do
the checklist and it concludes that you
might be training too often you're like
shit okay my frequency might be a little
bit high my joints are
uh kind of messed up i'm not really
recovering train no mind muscle
connections poor pumps etcetera so on
and so forth
okay what you do and this is a huge
point
decrease your current frequency in the
next message cycle that you try
by just one session per week okay guys
we'll train like four times a week
and i'd be like i need to fucking
decrease my frequency bro they go to one
time a week
what the fuck are you doing let's say
you have the same results
at one time a week that you had a four
you think fucking frequency doesn't
matter
well maybe but maybe two times a week
would have been amazing and three would
have been ultra amazing you just fucking
skipped all of them
don't do that anytime you ratchet your
frequency up or down over the course of
a meso
only once only once because you really
want to learn stuff right and
to see clear trends of what you might
learn later so near new frequency
because you want to reduce it
goes from three to two sessions a week
simple idea you wait always do this
between maslow's never within him as a
cycle or almost never
bieber at all whatever you hear that
stupid-ass song is written
never say never watch like i get to like
training justin bieber and become
friends
and he sees this video he's like you
thought that song was stupid i was like
biebs
bro i was just playing around i'm saying
i'm a nobody compared to you 120 million
instagram followers you feel me why
don't you give me some of those shits
in any case all right three times a week
to two times a week
now you want to do a few things examine
first your stimulus to fatigue ratio
how are your workouts going are you
getting better or worse tension and burn
in the muscle
better or worse workout performance
pumps local fatigue
how are your joints feeling how is your
systemic fatigue especially in the last
weeks of accumulation
so if you reduce your frequency and
usually in the last weeks of
accumulation
last week or two your joints are fucked
up because you were doing three times a
week training
now you're doing two times a week
training you're noticing it's like last
week in the meso
and your muscles are tired you're super
fucked up but your joints are golden
you're like oh my god like
i can't believe i waited this long to
try two times a week training this is
incredible it's the greatest thing i've
ever done for myself
that makes a lot of sense next and
always
you don't want to go just on subjective
stuff you want to examine objective
performance as well
so what you're going to do there is
you're going to figure out
how much your rep strength went up as
measured
after the deload that means you do a
whole mesocycle of whatever exercise
you're doing
deload next meso you can start maybe the
same frequency over again
give it another try so our first message
was 3x
then we're like i think checklist says
we're training too often maybe
we go to 2x do a whole mesocycle d load
then
2x again to try it more than a few times
good good scientific practice
and also that you know first week
etc all the way through that first meso
now we get this next meso
after the deload to compare our
performances and if
our rep strength is up like a pretty
noticeable way
hey shit maybe we're onto something
right because it's like you're benching
135 for sets of like 15
in that first meso with you retraining
3x a week
and then the second meso you were
benching it for roughly the same but
towards the end
like you hit a few new pr's you're like
okay maybe i'm just having a good
session good
couple of sessions maybe it's nothing
the next meso that second time you do 2x
a week
you start off the meso with already an
almost pr holy shit and then it's pr pr
prpr
to where at the end of that third meso
you're way stronger than you were
uh in that that first meso before that
at the 3x frequency and you're like okay
i don't know frequencies for sure
growing a ton of muscle but
i'm getting great pumps great burns etc
my joints aren't fucked up and i'm
hitting bigger pr's
i'm no rocket surgeon but i think i'm
onto some shit
right so if your sfr goes up and your
performance is improved
gee you know maybe the frequency isn't
what did it but it sure as hell isn't
holding you back enough
to mask that completely so maybe try
that frequency for a while until
nonetheless
you sort of do that checklist again and
you go oh maybe i can benefit from
increasing again or even going down
another notch
all right similar idea goes for
increasing frequency whatever your
frequency is now let's say it's two
times a week you're training your quads
or something
and you do checklist in the slide number
three and it says hey you know your
frequency is maybe a little bit too low
you increase your current frequency only
by one session never anymore because it
could be a huge disaster for
overreaching
and you might not be able to conclude
much because you jumped too much and now
you have a ton of uncertainty there
you go to three times a week same thing
examine your stimulus to fatigue ratio
pump burn etc system if you take all
that see how you feel
and of course examine your objective
performance to see
are you hitting new strength prs a
mesocycle later
if that's the case your sfr is up your
performance is up
man you know maybe that multiple
frequency thing is what did it a lot of
people have experience
specifically in that two to three free
frequency range
as a lot of people train once a week a
ton of people train twice a week but a
lot of people have never trained the
same muscle group three times a week
and what they end up doing is they don't
really
know that there's any sort of greener
pastures out there because they have
like have you trained your quads twice a
week like yep i love it it's my favorite
you've trained it once the guys do that
back on my bro days like you've ever
tried three times a week and they're
like
who the fuck can recover from that
here's the kicker this video assumes
you always start your mesocycles with
lower volumes and you're auto-regulating
your volume
so we're not saying do 10 sets you used
to do 10 sets once a week
now you're doing 10 cents twice a week
and now you're doing 10 steps three
times a week holy shit nobody can
recover from that and remotely get a
good workout one under the other
what we're saying is you start like
somewhere between three to ten sets per
muscle on the lower end in most cases at
the beginning of the meso
and you work up as tolerated so in the
twice a week training you might work up
to 12 sets each time
in the three times a week training maybe
you work up only 10 sets each time
because well you know you can't recover
as
quickly or as much volume so on and so
forth so granted this is done well and
organically with tons of autoregulation
you a lot of people have found that like
oh my god like i started training my
back three times a week
fuck i just started hitting crazy pr's
after a mesocycle even towards the end
of the first meso
and just something's clicking my back is
bigger my pumps are better i can't
believe
this is happening you would never know
if you didn't try
so we're not saying lower frequency is
for sure good or for sure bad
we're not saying higher frequencies for
sure anything we're saying given that
your frequency now first thing you do
analyze to see if it's at least decent
or if there's these big chunks if you
analyze it you're like oh it seems like
it's hitting all the boxes fuck it you
don't have to try anything you can for
shits and giggles but generally you
don't have to do anything at all
but if you look at your frequency and
you're like that shit all these say i'm
not training often enough to get my
optimal
give it a shot increase it by a little
see what happens and you might
look at back at this months and years
later be like you fucking believe i
spent three years
training you know shoulders four times a
week i fucking had shoulder pain i
didn't know what was doing wrong i was
looking at recovery supplements and
then i lowered it to three times a week
it was like the rebirth
i just like it my training was amazing
why didn't i think of this earlier
so if you have doubts if you have
questions maybe give this a shot of
course meticulously and carefully
don't expect crazy revolutions and
training but there could be some
pretty impressive stuff frequency
periodization last but not least there
is a
hypothetical case for it a pretty strong
case but nothing
to too crazy to write home about we know
we have good reason to believe
that lower frequencies are generally
less effective in any unit time
like i'm not the first to make this
analogy but it's like
if you have a gun to your head and you
have to grow as much quad size as
possible in
two months are you really only gonna
squat and leg press
once a week probably not okay you're
probably gonna do it
at least twice a week maybe more right
so uh
in a short certain unit of time lower
frequencies tend to be less effective
higher frequencies are more effective
but lower frequencies are more
sustainable for longer
and higher frequencies are less
sustainable and you think of we always
need sustainability
but sometimes we get a break after a
long bout of training
and then that tail end of the training
doesn't have to be very sustainable
here's a really good actually exact
it was a homology instead of an analogy
like i've used that before it's
technically a term i promise i'm not
making it up
so at the end of a marathon race you'll
notice in like like last several hundred
meters the guys will all fall out
sprint and you think like these fucking
idiots you're supposed to be conserving
your abilities when you're in a marathon
you've got to pace yourself well sort of
if you want to keep running after
but towards the end of a marathon you
can't actually sprint because it doesn't
fucking matter what you do after you
cross the finish line you can fall
it doesn't matter so you actually don't
have to pace yourself in that last
little bit you just
turn up the gas completely much the same
way if you have a whole block of
training let's say three mesocycles in a
row
after that you may have an active rest
phase and it doesn't really matter how
fucked up you are towards the end
because the active rest phase sort of
heals all wounds
so there's an argument to be made that
like maybe that last meso really can
crank it to 110
burn it out get all these awesome
benefits but then have the ability to
relax
at the end and and not go overboard we
don't actually need that sustainability
so
what this might have to happen uh
something for you to try potentially
it's kind of a pain in the ass
you have to rework your entire mesocycle
this is only for you advanced folks that
think this is a useful
uh exercise and something you're willing
to spend your time and complexity
thinking about maybe over three
consecutive mesocycles
like a block of training let's say a
mass gain block of like
uh four up one down four up and down
four up and down fifteen week
muscle gain block read hyper calorically
the whole time you might wanna do a
thing where you train with
slightly lower frequency at the
beginning for sustainability
slightly higher frequency in the middle
because you don't need to be as
sustainable and you can milk a little
bit more of the program
and then the last mesocycle the highest
possible frequency
that you can't even sustain for longer
than one meso why because you don't need
to sustain it because after that
it's active rest and who gives a shit so
the example here is meso one maybe two
time a week training
three time week training message two and
in the last cycle four time week
training
can't sustain that forever good news you
don't have to active rest
during which you train only twice a week
and it's barely training at all
and then you repeat the process is this
the way you should be training uh
no is it a potentially effective way
that you might want to explore if you're
really advanced absolutely
if you do this let me know in the
comments if you're still alive
if it worked out for you if you ran into
any problems folks best of luck
see you next time
