hey guys dr michael churchill here
for lecture number eight of the
training principles course the last
principle of training individualization
previously we've called it individual
differences doesn't really matter not
much just a little
change in terminology exactly the same
training principle so
what's on the agenda for today first we
have to define
two specific kinds of differences
one is inter-individual differences
we'll get to what that means in just a
bit
the other is intra-individual
differences we'll also get to that just
after that
we're going to give you guys the simple
definition afterwards of what individual
individualization really means we're
going to go through and do a technical
definition
a technical definition after that so you
guys have really high level knowledge
we're going to talk about why it's
ranked last because remember remember
this is after all the videos and they're
an order of importance we
literally consider at rp that
individualization is the least
important and last ranking principle why
we have really good reasons for that
we'll talk about those
we're going to give some examples of how
to apply and misapply
individualization and we're going to
talk about some pretty important
programming implications
not a a complete list but a really good
sampling
of some programming implications that
you can take away from
understanding that the principle of
individualization is important
and what its structure actually is so
in inter-individual difference
we are asking the question of
are different athletes different from
one another
because remember we're saying that when
we have the training principles they're
kind of like a road map
to building the best kind of training
program but if people are pretty
different
that road map's gonna have to be at
least a little bit different too
how are different athletes different
from one another well here's a couple of
really big examples
and there's tons more that we can think
of so age
would you really train a 13 year old the
same way you train a 57 year old
you have to give that some thought
probably not identically
what about limb lengths and heights have
you ever tried to teach someone to squat
when they had a normal sized torso of an
average height but they were six six or
six eight
it's a very different lift mechanic and
requires some
alteration body weights people are
different weights
if you're doing running programming and
someone is 270 pounds and wants to be a
good runner
and let's say they're already lean at
270 they want to be a really good hybrid
athlete
lifting and running is it really going
to be approached the same with volumes
and
intensities to someone who weighs 130
pounds is the pounding
the knees and ankles take gonna be the
same probably not
size and body weight is a big difference
between individuals
that has to be counterformer programming
sexism individuals can be different
males and females are not identical
there are distinct biological
differences that have to be accounted
for
still deeper and this is kind of the
obvious stuff
still deeper are the inherent
system design genetics for a variety of
different kinds of responses for example
genetics for adaptation
some people just grow muscle faster than
others some people grow muscles slower
some people grow muscles slower but more
consistently than others who grow
very fast within the first couple of
months or years and then they slow down
more
all kinds of differences there fatigue
management some individuals can have
huge volume load programs and recover
just fine other individuals at fractions
of those volumes
start to experience significant problems
with recovery what about staleness onset
what does that mean well it's going to
depend on our use of variation
so if an individual can continue to get
great workouts great stimulus great
improvements in performance from the
same set of exercises
for six months another individual after
only three months may experience a
significant stainless effect where they
just don't get the same thing out of the
workouts anymore
if you give those two individuals the
same exact bezel cycle structure
where both of them change at four months
or let's say four and a half
one individual essentially alternating
exercises not nearly frequently enough
for optimality and the other one
too often they could have gotten more
out of just the same stuff for longer
athletes differ from one another on
which muscle groups are weak or stronger
relative to one another so for example
back in the transition between equipped
power lifting and raw power lifting that
occurred
between 2005 and 2010 for the most part
there was a lot of equipped lifting lore
sort of carried over into what raw power
lifters need and one of those things was
that triceps were always the limiting
factor for the bench press
but they almost always were from most
equipped lifters because the shirt
helps you at the bottom of the range of
motion and it makes your pecs maybe not
obsolete but
certainly gives them way more help the
triceps have to press out
all the weight pretty much at the top
because the bench pressure doesn't
really do anything there
so then we got to the raw era and people
say you know bench press improvements
all about bringing up your tricep
strength
and for individuals whose triceps were a
pretty big limiting factor or could
stand to grow a lot more and get
stronger
that was really true and it worked
really well but other individuals just
didn't have big or strong enough chests
and their triceps were plenty big and
strong and they struggled off the chest
and it would just fail at the bar right
at the chest
and it seemed like terrible advice for
them and in fact it probably was because
it wasn't taking into account individual
differences the fact that their triceps
weren't holding them back
but another muscle group was so some
different program design implications
there
and there are like a a trillion other
factors that are different between
individuals
that's not the only kind of difference
that individualization has to account
for however
intra individual differences are changes
within a single athlete over time
for example over time adaptive
resistance
goes up so more overload is needed to
get
probably i was going to say the same
effect but really even worse effect and
if overload doesn't go up
nothing happens so you need more and
more and more to progress
as you get better and better so if you
say man you know that one program works
super well in high school i should try
to do it again
that's not really good logic in high
school you were a different person
you were probably smaller probably
weaker and probably much less exposed
to training so that your adaptive
resistance wasn't that very high
you could have been doing a pretty
crappy program back then and still got
great gains
because you didn't build up any adaptive
resistance now even the best program
might not make you progress as much
which is just as an aside a very
interesting
note to make on individuals who look
back over the training careers
to try to ascertain what worked best for
them if it was during the same
era of their training that they're
comparing two modalities that maybe
instructor for example
in year seven of uh an individual's
training they did a very very high
volume program
mostly and in year eight just one year
later still
intermediate range of trainee they did a
very very low program
and they got really way better results
on the lower volume program
than they did on the higher volume can
they conclude something from that
totally but if they can paint com
compare different
uh training modalities that they use in
different eras that's really not much to
conclude
for example that same high school
example say you know i used to bench
just once a week and i got great gains
when i was doing that in high school
later like after college i was training
three times a week in the bench press
and i just never got the same gains
would you there's nothing you can do
after college
if you've been lifting consistently the
whole time that's going to give you the
kind of gains you got in high school
and man you could probably do like plyo
jumps off a bosu ball with your
you know push-up jumps and still get
better gains in high school than doing
the best program that borah shaco can
come up with
after college it's just the way things
work so you got to be really careful
that
when you're comparing things across time
the individual is different so the
comparisons can get a little bit wonky
and it's
really good to tread very very carefully
in that terrain
your size changes your strength changes
right individuals that have a lot of
strength
uh can exert really nasty fatigue
amounts onto their systems just by
training not so much
you know if you're deadlifting 300
pounds you may be able to
five sets of six reps twice a week and
just get really great because your
fatigue doesn't accumulate that much
there's nobody doing that with 800
pounds
if you changed over time and you
eventually your deadlift was up to 800
pounds for those
similar poundages or similar rap schemes
you may be able to do a workout like
that once a month
once every three weeks that's how much
fatigue would accumulate so if things
very much change as you get bigger as
you get stronger
your technique improves over time so the
same technical fixes that used to
that have worked well for you in the
past may be inappropriate and
different weaknesses and technique can
develop you may
uh used to let's say you shoulder press
a certain amount let's say you
shoulder pressed 60 kilos for a set of
five back in the day
and you really needed to work on your
clean technique
and you couldn't clean much because your
technique sucks so anything you could
clean
you could definitely jerk and you were a
great jerker because
uh you were really strong in the
overhead movement
right relative to your clean but let's
say your clean technique improved
significantly
now with a 60 kilo for 5 overhead press
your jerk may be significantly lagging
and you'll start to experience problems
in the jerk and you'll start to wonder
well
why and all kinds of weird technique do
i need super technical fixes what's
going on
the answer is that you're where you were
sucking so to speak changed because one
area got much better than the other
and one area that used to be the best
was no longer the best all this kind of
stuff changes over time
which presents a challenge for
programming over time recovery ability
goes up
you don't take a soccer mom on her fifth
day of training
and give her an elite bodybuilder's
workout she could die
and i mean that literally rhabdomyolysis
has killed people okay it's when your
muscles break down from too much stress
and literally just go into the
bloodstream clog up your kidneys
really bad stuff happens volume
tolerance goes up over time
because recoverability goes up over time
you have to program that in it gets a
point
probably when you're training about five
to ten years consistently
are you going to look at your workout
you're going to go this is so much stuff
and then you got to go is it too much
and then you think no i can recover from
this
crap and because adaptive resistance
goes up over time you go this is
actually when i need to get better
it sucks totally if you like training
it's great but if you have a love-hate
relationship with training you got to
understand that
as your recoverability goes up over time
it's the
fastest path to gains is to make sure
you're actually tending
to that by giving it enough volume from
which to recover and of course there's a
thousand other factors that change over
time so a lot of differences both
between individuals and within each
individual
over time so the simple definition of
individualization
as a training principle just a layman's
term is
people are different from one another
and from themselves over time
training should be adjusted to account
for these differences
training can't continue to be the same
for everyone or even the same person
over time
the technical definition is of course a
bit more technical differences between
and within individuals mandate the
degree to which in the mode in which
all of the other training variables are
applied
changes notice and we'll come back to
this in a bit
we're not saying some of the training
principles don't work they all work and
they work in the same way for everyone
but the degree to which we're going to
be applying them
is going to be changing sort of like
every car needs an engine to go
somewhere
but the size of the engine is going to
depend on the size of the car's frame
what it's designed to do etc etc so
for example some individuals need more
volume to
overload than other individuals they
just need more
for some individuals what is past their
maximum recoverable volume is what for
others
isn't even maintenance volume that
happens so
you can't program the same volume for
everyone some individuals grow from
relatively heavier weights than others
and i don't just mean with strength
because there's fiber type differences
in this probability relationship between
fiber type and relative intensity
some individuals in some of their muscle
groups work grow really well from sets
of five sets of six sets of seven sets
of eight
other individuals won't grow much at all
unless sets are 12 13
14 or 15 reps each so there's
differences there
some individuals accumulate very little
fatigue for a variety of reasons
right so they can get slammed with
volume if needed
because they don't accumulate fatigue
very fast others accumulate fatigue a
lot
and that doesn't always mean that those
that accumulate fatigue grow
less quickly sometimes it's the same
individuals that make the greatest gains
that also accumulate the most fatigue
and require the most advanced fatigue
management strategies
there is a difference in technical
acquisition and in technical proficiency
and there's even a difference in how
stable your technique
is without having reviewed it for
example in a very technique heavy sport
some individuals need to go back and
review certain techniques
more often than others otherwise they
get rusty at them quickly
there are some savants in sport that you
teach them a technique once or once
they've got it down they just
never forget it and it's always crisp
everyone else is on some point of the
spectrum
all the way to the individual who in
strength and conditioning
circles is a very politically incorrect
term it was called a motor moron
uh and his coaches use that all the time
usually behind an athlete's back
and that's when someone literally could
barely be taught a technique and as soon
as they learn it the
two or three days later they forget it
entirely now various people at that
extreme very few people are savants
but everywhere in between is a degree of
technical proficiency and in the case of
this example uh there is a question of
how often do you need to review a
certain technique or group of techniques
in order to keep that fresh so you can
use it on the field of play
the differences between that means that
there's going to be differences in
training program design based on
individual athlete proclivities
so those are differences between
individuals
but the very same individual can change
on all of
what we just said from one year to the
next
all right so we can't assume that
identical programming is historic
that to what it was has been
historically effective is going to be
effective in the future
right and we always and this is one of
those real that second point is a real
big
challenge in programming and a challenge
in getting better over time
as you change what you require to be
your best
changes the way i used to train years
ago
got me pretty good gains but if i tried
it now it wouldn't get me very good
gains at all
it could either be really pretty and
effective or it could be way too much
and get me hurt in a variety of
different respects
if only training was about discovering
which formula worked for you and then
just doing it you know forever
it's not what works for you changes over
time
so that's another big challenge of
training that we have to attend to
now individualization is ranked last
on all of the principles why isn't
individual difference
important yes but
individual difference or
individualization the differences
between individuals
both between individuals and within one
individual over time
um has often too often
so often been overrated
where uh any and every claim has been
legitimated with
it works for me but it works for me
right no body
for no one does it work to violate the
basic principles of training
nobody people do all kinds of really
stupid stuff
that violates the training principles
and they're still good in spite of
themselves
they still get progress and because
they're violating a training principle
or just not doing a very good job of
exploiting a training principle
let's say their application of overload
is sporadic
let's say they don't do progressive
overload as much as they progress
every now and again instead of on a plan
do they still get better yes
because they could have phenomenal
genetics or just really good genetics
for adaptation
that even not very overloading things
make them grow faster than the best kind
of overloads for someone of average
genetics
and they say well you know my method of
training works for me
what if they had another method of
training that could have been
better this is a very important point
the it works for me is an important
piece of information
it certainly means you're not screwing
things up totally totally bad
but remember that something else could
have worked even better
and people take their works for me so
far that they start their training
starts to look like real crap
they could have been better if they had
done better
imagine that you went you took today's
modern sport practices and you took them
back
into 1895 when people were training for
you know some of the first long-distance
races that were run in modern times
1895. people were doing all kinds of
stuff wrong back then
can you imagine taking a time machine
full of scientists and the best coaches
coming back and pulling aside the person
back in time
that you know if he just ran the best
race ever from butterfly effect events
the earth wouldn't get destroyed by
aliens in 2050 and in 2049 we find that
out we send back a team of scientists
to get that person to run as fast of a
marathon as possible
and that person like looks at all the
scientists and stuff everything's
explained to them they calm down no
longer have a panic attack like you know
this all the stuff is great but
i'm the best or pretty close this stuff
works for me
yeah but what about all this advanced
stuff it could work better it will work
better right similarly if you took a
modern vehicle
back to henry ford's office in the 1920s
and he said you know our model t work
just fine
well watch this everything your model t
does our new cars do 50 times better and
faster and cleaner in
every conceivable way better did a model
t
work yes did it get people from point a
to point b
yes did it revolutionize uh modern
industrial practices
absolutely was it a great car for its
era you bet
but does it in any way compare to what
we have today no way
so wouldn't that suck if you were the
kind of person that says well this works
for me
and that entire time you were
close-minded to training practices that
were already around that were better
maybe not a ton better maybe a little
bit better
and when you play second place in your
competition that you've been training
for for two years
someone could come up to you they're
really not a nice person and go
still working for you you would say oh
damn it you try to choke them or
something
but you could say well i did as best as
i could but did you really
right so people try to say that
individual differences make them these
totally different animals to whom
sport training principles don't apply
there have been very gifted athletes in
the past say i don't train with weights
because weight training doesn't work for
me
really increases in cross-sectional area
and force production
power and velocity do not advantage your
game
so if a genie came down and said you
could have extra added strength with no
cost
you wouldn't take it i doubt right so
this is one of the reasons why
individual differences in
individualization is ranked last
is because it only modifies all of the
other principles
everybody needs overload everybody needs
specificity
every single living human needs fatigue
management in their program
every single training principle is a
given it applies exactly the same way to
everyone
individualization just modifies those
principles so they can be applied in the
appropriate matter in a program
which also while it's listed last isn't
just because it has the least effect
though it does it's also because it's
listed last because it modifies
everything that came before it
it's not as much its own training
principle as it is a modifier to
everything else
so what are some examples of application
of this principle well
one of your clients let's say you're
training clients and
you have one of your clients do eight
sets of ten
another of your clients you may never go
above four sets of ten
because even three sets of ten for that
other client
is pushing the threshold of their
recovery abilities
so if you programmed let's say six sets
of ten for both clients just one
program right the one ring unite them
all
one of the individuals would literally
be overreaching and possibly eventually
overtraining
terrible results the other individual
wouldn't be sufficiently challenged and
it wouldn't be enough for them
that's a bad deal right
next over application
how do we over apply individual
differences well it's when an individual
thinks they're so different
that regular training doesn't even apply
to them so for example if a gifted
sprinter on your track team
uh runs three miles at night uh by
himself at home every day
three mile run doesn't make you good at
sprinting if you're any good already it
makes you worse
right and he's so gifted genetically he
says hey you know it works for me
that violates the principle of
specificity if he stopped running three
miles
he would get better at sprinting almost
guaranteed so we have to be really
careful about that
an over application of individual
differences is literally clearly defined
as
violating other training principles
because you think you're that much
different
that's over application under
application
is very easy to define that's when we
simply
give everyone more or less the same
program there's not enough of a
difference in what people are doing
and then it's a bad deal because some
people get much worse
some people get uh pretty good but
nobody really receives the optimal are
very few people
so for example a football coach give
everyone in the same workout with no
accounting for differences
volume or responses or tolerances so
let's say it's five by five
some people they're pretty fatigued a
two by five a three by five is enough
for them and some people they don't even
feel the workout until six by five
seven by five why would you give
everyone the same workout not a good
idea
lastly some program design implications
from the principle of individualization
so first of all we've already mentioned
this but it's really important
every single program must concord with
the first
six training principles but the degree
not
if it concords the degree to which those
principles are applied
right how much overload how much
specificity
how often do we vary what kind of
structure do we use for phase
potentiation
we're still face potentiating just
changing it a little bit
those principles are all applied and
altered based on individualization so
the first six are always applied but the
degree to which they're applied is a
question for individualization
right it's kind of like every car is an
engine
every car has a frame every car has a
transmission
the exact type of transmission the size
of the frame the power of the engine may
very well be different
but if you look on the road and look at
the cars cars all pretty much look
very similar right a child can draw a
car and get the fundamental meaning of
it there's not really a car
that instead of wheels has you know
spider tentacles that it moves around
with
right there are very vast similarities
and only differences
in the details of exactly what category
applies in what sense
now if you want to use individualization
athlete monitoring is key it is critical
what is athlete monitoring athlete
monitoring is the collection of
variables of data how you're progressing
how you're feeling what your weights are
what your body weights are etc
over time to actually track your
responses because remember
i felt like the bench press program in
high school was better is a nonsensical
statement unless you have
actual hard data or at least a memory of
hard data of
why you say well i went from benching
200 to 250 in 10 weeks
okay now we're talking right so if you
want to really say well individually
this doesn't work for me this does
better
the next question is how do you know
that and if you could pull out your
training notebook and say this is how
that's it case closed if you can't
that's cool you don't need to justify
yourself to anyone and you could very
well be on the right track
but what about to yourself when you're
you know falling asleep alone later that
night and someone you remember the
conversation in gym like how do you know
this works best for you and you're like
damn it i don't know if it works best
for me i've just been doing it and i got
you guys know how we all get a little
bit um defensive about our training
practices
why are you squatting like that because
it works for me okay jeez back off okay
great
right and then later that night the
person who said that works for me has
fallen asleep and he's thinking
do i really know if this works for me or
not
maybe it works fine could that person
who had recommended a different squat
stance could they be correct
yeah maybe but if you had a training
notebook in a journal
and you had experimented with the other
stance before and you got terrible
results for pretty clear reasons
let's say your adductors just swell up
and get two sores there's too much
volume for them you have to bring your
squat closer and then your quads get hit
and everything's great
then you don't have to have a
justification you have one already
right so if that person's like so why
don't you squat wide or you can go we'll
see my adductors flare up what happens
every time here's my training notebook
happens three times in a row
it's good enough for me and they go oh
jeez okay that makes sense right and
they could not say that they could say
well i don't know i think it still works
and then they're one thing
making the mistake right so
yes it's good to be a monitoring and one
of those reasons
is that some individual characteristics
take a long time to figure out
so you don't want to be quick to assume
that you have yours figured out
right a muscle growth response for
example
how do you know what grows muscle the
best for you
muscle growth is something that unless
you're talking about very very ranked
beginners
takes months and maybe even years to
figure out
so if you do a program for two weeks and
you go ah
this isn't this isn't growing muscle
like i like it too
how the hell do you know that well you
got like a like a super gravity chamber
at home that analyzes muscle tissue down
to the
milligram or something like that no
right how do you tell if muscle growth
has
been improved visual changes appearance
changes how your clothes fit
and repetition max differences
especially for
multiple sets if your five by 10 in the
squat went up by 20 pounds you probably
got bigger muscles if at the same time
your pants are
fitting tighter and your quads visibly
look bigger and have more details
then you know that you've hypertrophied
but how long does things take
to visibly show up months so if you do a
program for a couple of days and you're
like
this isn't it unless you're using good
proxy variables like you know that the
pro
workouts that get you pumped or they get
you sore the ones that usually make you
grow
ah man unless you have that kind of data
you really can't tell
so really good part of sport practice is
when you try different things
stick to what fundamentally doesn't
violate any principles give things time
to figure out if they work for you
because you could realize that every
time you tried something you didn't give
it enough time to work
another really interesting thing with
giving something enough time to work
is how you're testing when it works so
for example
if you're testing to see if a power
lifting program improved your strength
and you do it right at the end of that
program without deloading or tapering
you're going to be testing at a time of
very high fatigue and you're going to
look at it and say well i didn't get any
stronger
but what about if you rested a week or
just at light training for a week if you
do that you get 30 pound pr in your
squat all of a sudden the results are
completely different
so not only do you need to take enough
time to apply different variables to see
if you in fact respond differently but
it also is a really good idea
to make the testing circumstances as
close to ideal as possible remember you
want the truth
you want that electron microscope of
science you don't want to just kind of
look at something like
that it didn't work then if you're going
to do that you might as well just take
all your biases put them together and
see if you can get a bias-driven program
uh and that's easy to do but if you
really want the best results you're
going to have to
be as precise as you can with testing
whatever new thing you test out on your
program you have to give it the best
possible conditions
another really quick example is doing a
hypertrophy program
but not eating enough to gain much
weight you say yeah you know my eating
wasn't on spot
this last couple of months but i don't
feel like this program grew me much
muscle well how the hell do you know
if it would have worked if you would
have eaten properly you got to give
everything a really good chance to show
itself now once it doesn't show itself
especially a couple of times over and
over you can feel free to abandon it for
the time being
remember as your body changes you might
have to come back to it but you don't
have to keep pounding away things that
don't work
just make sure that when you're closing
the door on something you've seen what's
inside the room pretty well to know that
it's worth closing the door
last little tidbit just a quick aside
that always comes up
for strength and conditioning coaches
especially we have this
really uh fundamentally good sort of
moral understanding that hard work is a
good thing
and it damn well is and
from that we get this idea that athletes
that don't want to do
a lot of volume training or don't train
as much
that they're being lazy they're sort of
recalcitrant on the idea of hard work
and they're to be sort of uh
social sociologically punished or looked
down upon like damn it johnson
you know you're a lazy bastard you don't
want to work that's why you're never
going to be the best
there is a time and a place for that
kind of stuff but here's a cool
interesting fact
individuals that have more fast which
muscle fibers
benefit from doing less work because
they can disrupt homeostasis so much
more easily
because their fibers take so much more
time to recover
for a number a variety of other reasons
individuals with faster twitch fibers
require less work less volume for their
optimal response
but their optimal response in strength
power on speed sports is usually even
better than individuals with slow twitch
fiber types so what does that mean
it means that some of your most gifted
athletes on a track team on a basketball
team
on a football team on a weightlifting
team are going to be the ones
who actually need the least amount of
work
couple of take-home points from that one
figure out what somebody's maximum
recoverable volume is
before you start yelling at them that
they're being lazy if they're getting
really good gains and really good
progress
and they're doing a small amount of work
they're doing everything they can that's
a great thing
and if every time you push them into
doing more work they start to fatigue
and tire out or it doesn't work
you can stop yelling them from being
lazy because it's not a good idea
for for you uh to keep pushing them
because their physiology
doesn't really benefit from that another
thing is
there is a team culture in which
individuals on a team pretty much all
the athletes
look to what the best athletes are doing
and try to emulate it
but some of the not as great athletes on
a team will be slower twitch on average
in strength power sports
than individuals on the team who are
more gifted
those will be faster twitch and if the
more gifted individuals are doing really
well and let's say they do only three
sets of an exercise
the slow twitch individuals could come
up to you and say listen why do you have
me program for eight sets
or they might just not even tell you
anything it was the worst part they
could just slack off and be like well
what's his name's done
and is the best on the team why am i
still doing all this work
you got to be really careful about that
right because
if that's the conclusion what ends up
happening is the slow twitch individual
or slower twitch individual doesn't do
enough work to maximize their responses
and then they do all the work months and
months later they go yeah but i'm still
not as good as that person
you kind of need to pull them aside
maybe at some point and be like look
this is a gifted person
i mean who knows how much better you'll
get or they'll get over the years but
over the months and weeks
they're going to get better faster than
everyone because they're gifted and the
thing is that's not a very hard
explanation because most athletes know
that already they've been on teams long
enough
through their whole lives to where they
know who's gifted and who's not and they
know it's kind of pointless to chase the
gifted people you got to do what's best
for you
and for your physiology if you're slower
twitch that means more work
and if you're faster twitch sort of on
the other hand we always think it's top
down the coaches are making the fast
twitch people do more work well
sometimes the fast fish people
themselves get sort of complexes about
it
and go man you know i want to outwork
everyone well hold on a second there are
people on the team that are slower
twitch that you don't want to outwork
because that artwork
is gonna be beyond your maximum
recoverable volume beyond what you can
do recover from and benefit from there's
no point in doing that
right so taking all that together
individualization is very important
to apply to every single program but
individualization just modifies all the
other training principles
they come first but the question of how
to employ them is
an answer that individualization can
provide folks thanks for tuning in
see you next time for the last wrap-up
lecture
on this training principles course
