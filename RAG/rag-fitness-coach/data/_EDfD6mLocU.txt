this is the most intense banana cutting
i've ever seen in my life good job
you defeated defeated the banana
[Music]
oh my goodness don't even no i'm just
saying it's very satiating
so are you feeling full yet
yeah
all right what's going on guys so in
this video i'm going to be attempting
steph's old all-in diet from when she
first went all in now for those of you
guys who don't know steph and i've been
away from each other for just about
three months and we finally reunited um
so to celebrate that and to celebrate
the fact that steph has been one year on
her all-in journey i figured i would
give this a shot so i could try to truly
appreciate how extreme her hunger was at
the beginning so if you guys aren't
familiar with all and what that's all
about definitely make sure you check out
stephanie's one year recap video i was
in it i thought she did an amazing job
with that and i'll link that down below
but for those of you guys who have a
shorter attention span i'm going to do a
super quick science explain video we're
going to hop into that in three
two
science explain
[Music]
so in the context of steph's journey we
can think about the all-in process like
this just like many people run into
health problems when they carry too much
body fat people also run into health
problems when they carry too little body
fat now this is well documented in the
scientific literature in both men and
women where we see all of these negative
health effects from constant dieting so
the primary goal of going all in is to
relieve yourself of these mental and
physical detriments with weight gain
being a necessary side effect now the
all in approach borrows heavily from the
literature on intuitive eating where
your dietary behavior is guided by three
main principles you give yourself
unconditional permission to eat when
hungry and what food is desired so no
restriction you eat for physical rather
than emotional reasons and you use
internal hunger signals to determine
when and how much to eat now steph's all
in approach focused mainly on that first
principle as a way of reducing food fear
and the extreme hunger that comes as a
result of constant dieting and in the
scientific literature this
acceptance-based style of eating has
been repeatedly associated with
reductions in eating disorder
symptomology and better physical and
psychological well-being it also borrows
from the strategy used by dr nicola
rinaldi author of no period now what
where she's helped hundreds of women
restore a healthy menstrual cycle by
consuming a minimum of 2500 calories per
day with no maximum and no specific food
restrictions now some people might
suggest that a slower rate of weight
gain would be more ideal and that might
be true for some people like those who
are very underweight and at risk of
refeeding syndrome or those who have
future goals of say competing in a
fitness event or getting very lean again
but for someone like steph who is ready
to get to a healthy body weight set
point and restore her physical and
mental health quickly i can confidently
say that the faster all-in approach
worked wonderfully for her of course
like any nutrition approach
individualization is important so don't
take this as nutrition advice for you
and for that i'll just go ahead and link
plenty of helpful resources down below
including steph science video and her
one year recap video okay back to the
vlog
all right so i do remember what i eat
but i wanted it to be really realistic
so i i grabbed my journal and i wrote a
lot of like my full nails but i always
wrote down how many calories i ate at
the end of the day i just picked a
random day like
june 21st 2019 so
almost exactly a year ago i ate this
many calories i'm not gonna say it
because i don't want to give it away and
my fitness pal because i trapped i had
exactly what i ate so this is like a
legit
what i ate on a certain day all in so
i'm not just like picking things out of
a hat
this is legit
all right what you got for me i would
always have two packets and this is my
favorite oatmeal it's from trader joe's
because it's really thick it's gonna be
gonna be a little bit full
yep you're gonna slice it pretty thin
okay
the most intense banana cutting i've
ever seen in my life good job
you defeated it defeated the banana the
big bowl of oatmeal thicker than a bowl
yeah so you just add the bananas on top
so i know i'm gonna put
yeah you do know yeah i follow you
and then you're going to add a little
bit of cereal on top special k
protein cinnamon brown sugar 900 grams
of protein that's pretty good
look at that beautiful i give you an a
plus for aesthetics i'm proud of you
yeah i'm gonna dig in this looks really
good it smells really good too
let's do it meal one so i'm gonna try to
get a good combination here
what do you think yeah that's good yeah
it's not as sweet as i expected i like
that crunch from the cereal i'm glad you
like it yeah
[Music]
oh my goodness don't even no i'm just
saying it's very satiating oh my god i
mean i probably had about a quarter of
it but it feels like a normal bowl of
oat like a one packet already that's
what it feels like it's pretty funny the
thing is is i'm not a big breakfast
eater to begin with like my appetite is
always lower in the morning
and i'm more of a savory over a sweet
struggle if you get any more
oatmeal is like one of my small meals
man let me say this
if you struggle with feeling full in the
morning this is your game right here
yeah because this will make you feel
cool
[Music]
it's so much more
in real life than it looks oh two
packets oatmeal's two packs of oatmeal
people can do the math
people know how much that is
you will know exactly how much that is
hooray
you did it
i mean honestly like yeah like i said
if
nothing else people are going to learn
how to
make themselves feel cool
what's next
the way we're setting this up is i'm
following steph's all in diet from the
beginning like when she first went all
in and her hunger was at the highest how
many calories would you say you're
eating now like i don't track anymore
but i
i tracked on a random day just to see
roughly and that day was 2 800 so i
would say anywhere between 25 and 3 000
is what i'm eating every day now eating
now i gotcha i'm not 42 pounds up
anymore i'm like 28 pounds up from where
i started you're still eating to satiety
it's just that your hunger signals have
regulated
themselves from the weight gain and now
you're kind of like settling back in and
the other thing i should mention is you
started eating mostly whole foods like
when you first went all in and that was
kind of like a rule that you had for
yourself like you wouldn't eat too much
junk food whereas later on in the
journey as your appetite started to
subside you kind of opened yourself up
to eating whatever it was that you
desire which wasn't always junk food but
maybe sometimes you went outside that
75-25 rule which i think from a
psychological perspective was a good
thing to help you get over that
fear of certain foods
um but i'm doing it when you first went
out yeah it was like a high calorie but
high calorie with a lot of whole foods
not quite as much processed foods if you
wanted something you'd have it like i
think a lot of people have this idea
that when you went all in it was just
all junk food but it actually wasn't
like that that might have been better
psychologically but this allowed you to
get a lot fuller on somewhat lower
calories
so anyway that's that's what i'm going
to be doing i do have to say that i had
somewhat of a rationale for the whole
foods theory because i felt like i
really wanted to improve my health so i
had some like deficiencies i did blood
work and things like that so i was like
so focused on like health related things
i was like trying to get like nutrient
dense foods in that's why i thought the
whole foods idea was a good one but i
have to say that
it just was so hard on my digestion it
was really hard like to eat a bunch of
whole foods as much as i needed because
of how hungry i was so jeff was gonna
get a little taste of that today
so something i had very regularly was a
veggie burger
with potatoes i eat a lot of potatoes
oatmeal from meal one potatoes for meal
two you're trying to kill me a woman
all right so we just went and picked
these up for a little snack in between
meals follow the stuff now
these are a classic mm-hmm
and now this is something i can enjoy
yeah yeah yeah cheesy savory stuff
that's my jam
yeah
[Music]
oh
there you go
[Music]
meal number two meal two
it actually looks really it looks really
good you excited about this i'm feeling
hungry right now meal two we got a
double stacked veggie burger with some
cheese some pickles some ketchup and a
little bit of avocado mixed greens under
there some baby potatoes i'm gonna eat
these with a little bit of sour cream a
[Music]
diminutive sweet potato for the record
okay for the record i was trying to go
easy on him and i gave him a small sweet
potato because i wasn't sure if he would
be able to handle all those potatoes
it's a lot of potatoes so that's that's
why so this is what i'm gonna do because
i actually like sweet potato but i like
it nice and salty like that yeah look at
that
yeah i used to always have two patties
one wasn't enough
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
i'm so surprised that of the meals you
didn't struggle with this one no that
one was good that was just a good hearty
meal i feel satiated after that yeah
after the breakfast i was like i'd say
like eight or nine out of ten full
now i'm just like yeah i'm just like
normal like that felt like a good
pre-workout i was shocked i feel very
satiated but it was it was very like
nourishing i i genuinely thought the
potatoes were going to get you no
there's little tiny things and then the
sweet potato was so small and i haven't
had sweet potato in a while so it was
actually wow i would have that meal
again
so i might actually go get a little arm
pump yeah i'm going to do a little
workout
okay sounds good
all right
two scoops
big arm day yeah prolific and
creatine so i take three grams of this a
day even on my rest days
on my armpits
so my new power building program i've
got one day that's just a dedicated
round day so that's what i'm gonna be
hitting today
people are gonna love that
[Music]
oh everybody
this is different working on that
i know
what you got for me next
are you hungry i i need it my glycogen
is is on zero oh
okay all right let's do it that's super
light headed oh check this out just kind
of glimpse oh yeah
now would be a good time some glycogen
in here
i'm gonna wash my hands first all right
let's see what all the hype is about
all right so
here we've
got a raspberry filled
glazed donut from
krispy kreme
this is my favorite donut of all time i
don't know if you had these much when
you were all in but you definitely had
them on your cheat days
i would have a donut and i would always
try the new donuts and whenever i would
want one i would get one
good so good there that's a beauty
i didn't need to have a dozen donuts
like i did on my cheat days i would have
a donut like a singular or one or two
when i would want one and that was it so
jeff gets a donut
since you've been in canada you haven't
had one of those in a while because they
don't have krispy kreme in canada that's
right i'm gonna say i'm the biggest
donut lover but i love krispy kreme feel
your body
there it is
yup
done this is so good after a workout
should i dive in
jump in
jump
stop
[Music]
all right
what do you got
so something i used to eat a lot of i
mean a lot of
[Music]
so we're going to do one serving of each
eye
oh that's not much no no do two servings
two servings okay
you're really all in
104 grams
post-workout cereal
it's like one and a half servings yep
yum that's great all right let's see
what this cereal is all about
good hey i love that i've had these
before these are so good
[Music]
so are you feeling full yet
yeah
yeah i think i'm gonna leave it at one
bowl for now so it's quite a lot of milk
as well
i feel like cereal grows in your stomach
it's one definitely one of those
deceptively satiating yep
that's the best part right there oh yeah
yeah i still think i was most full after
the oatmeal yeah yeah that i'm like i'm
like one to ten fullness levels
right now okay okay that's not too bad
maybe in a half hour i'll be ready for
dinner sounds good
i didn't have those on my all in days
this is good
the mango just a little four pm nightcap
yeah
i don't know what you're cooking so it's
all a surprise to me yeah we didn't we
didn't plan this ahead of time so
i'm just like
gradually tracking it as we go and i'm
realizing i got a bit left to go yet yep
yep you're not done yet
so we got rotini pasta ground turkey
with some spaghetti sauce and then three
mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce
this looks this looks really good to me
well all this looks like a lot of food
yep how is it it's actually really good
yeah yeah so good that sauce is
delicious yeah i like the pasta too yeah
this is totally something i would eat
just normally
it's just a lot of it i'm a bit full
let me have that taste of these yep cook
those in the airfryer
good
pretty good
what do you mean did i not cook them all
the way i feel full oh
i thought i didn't cook them all the way
no no no
they taste fine i'm gonna get through it
yep you better you're gonna be hurting a
little bit after this one
it's all fun and games till she hits you
with the pasta
that's what i say this is officially
harder than the oatmeal
oh heck yeah
[Music]
ready for dessert no
absolutely not
was harder than i expected pasta
very filling
so guys i'm gonna save
the matzah sticks for a little bit later
because i'm not trying to torture myself
over here that was a good meal i feel
really really full though i feel like a
9.5 i'm really cool so it's still early
yeah i'm gonna take a little break i
might even go lie down for a little bit
watch a little bit of my man ronnie over
here taking the supplements
and i'll check with you guys in a little
bit
okay so
you're having sushi
legos
that's okay
it's not gonna be here for like an hour
[Laughter]
you're such a troll gonna knock out
those mozzarella sticks
[Music]
they're a little
stylish
but still pretty good
35 chicken breasts
[Music]
[Laughter]
one second left scotty pippin on the
bench oh
[Laughter]
oh there it is
a couple hours later 7 30. 7 30. it's
about 7 30 and
we ordered some sushi
so steph you're gonna have to tell me
when i point to it you say what it is um
i think that's like the sexy girl roll
or something it was one of their
specialty roles it sounded good there's
spicy tuna avocado crunchy and eel sauce
on it okay and then this looks like it's
just a normal tuna roll spicy tuna spicy
tuna and this is california california
we're gonna finish this up
pretty strong
that was good sushi
i do like the sexy sexy mama
okay last one
good job sushi was good
we got sushi quite awesome
[Music]
here we are what time is it 8 44. back
where we start where the start is yep
this is a long day
okay okay okay time to get serious
all right
what am i eating for my last meal you
left off with sushi and normally after i
would have my final savory meal i would
have something sweet at the end of the
night we have a whole thing of
watermelon in there
you don't have not all of it
just a few bites of watermelon i'd have
like a small bowl of fruit at the end of
the night and then maybe some ice cream
okay yeah all right fresh new tub yep
briars oreo and chips ahoy yum so we got
300 grams of watermelon over here we've
got
one banana so second banana of the day
steph says she's eating two or three
bananas every day
and
in honor of the jeff nippert island diet
we've got one singular kiwi mm-hmm and
birthday cake oreo
and we're going to have two servings of
this breyer's oreo chips away
and i think based on my calculations
over there that'll put me just over 5000
calories that's a lot of ice cream not
enough we're all in
that's half in
still not only oh buddy 98 in ooh buddy
all in
okay
so
i'm gonna leave whatever that is i would
i would guess that was about half the
serving because i think if i eat any
more
it might make me a little bit sick and
that's definitely not the purpose of
volume
[Music]
i actually did think that like around
5000 calories would be pretty easy
the second thing is that
eating
highly satiating foods like potatoes
pasta fruits does make eating a lot of
calories a lot more difficult so if you
want to eat less calories obviously
that's something you'd want to
prioritize so i'm going to wrap it up
there
[Laughter]
we're not wasting this for the record
we're gonna put it back we don't we're
not wasting anything i should do a quick
weigh-in and a quick posing clip for you
guys yeah so i didn't have that much
ready yeah
[Music]
it's not bad
[Music]
it's good fuel for the body your workout
tomorrow is going to be amazing
170.0 there you go so i think i was 164
this morning so six pounds oh
it doesn't sound like much right no all
right well that's a wrap folks
[Music]
