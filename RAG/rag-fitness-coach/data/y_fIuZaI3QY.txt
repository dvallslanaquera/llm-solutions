let's see what's left in those arms I
can't even like feel my hand honestly
I'm serious my left hand like in here
over I'm right left hands are overrated
[Music]
me I'm Dr Mike from Renaissance
fertilization this is Ife Pro Jared
feather and Boise handsome let's just
take a minute to appreciate how handsome
Jared is
Jared you will love yourself
a failed Endeavor yeah this is Brian
that's right only Brian he is an only
fans producer mogul
multi-millionaire no joke for real for
real not like me I get paid in Nick Shaw
promissory notes don't know what they
mean but Nick says hey here you go this
man is top of his game entrepreneur also
been in a few adult Productions himself
I might add they're not that good wow
they're fine well good enough for my end
but please look them up
in any case I actually tried to audition
for an adult film once they everyone
laughed at me until I just left it
wasn't even say anything out of
acceptance thank you so much yeah I got
you in any case this is a busy man legit
he runs a team of a ton of people who
create content we do the back end stuff
he is a multi-millionaire he's trying to
make more of that money he does not have
time for a normal sit down and wait for
four minutes between such type of
workout so Jared and I are going to take
him through a gentle Ginger the way they
said that wrong insanely difficult total
upper body workout we're gonna do back
we're gonna do shoulders we're gonna do
arms with minimum rest between compound
alternating supersets holy crap let's
get going and also
he didn't always used to look like this
you are quite shapely and quite
man-esque but uh how do I say this in a
politically correct manner before you
used to be fucking fat wow I didn't say
it I love it he said it don't laugh that
much something about that fat people I
was just unbelievable Jared how dare you
we left everyone on this channel we love
you and we wouldn't have loved you
before you're about to get toasted with
the supper body workout three two one go
foreign
[Music]
we said the first exercise is going to
be a superset of pull-ups with dips
muscles that are involved in both are
minimum so while the pulling muscles are
resting after the pull-ups the dip
muscles are working and vice versa we're
going to take about zero rest between
pull-ups and dips after dips we take 30
seconds rest just to get a little bit of
air back and then we hit it again and
again and again three or four sets we'll
see how that goes amazing time framing
technique but hold on why while I'm
talking is my head smaller and off to
the side and brine being warmed up by
Jared four lap pull downs and for dips
why don't we just get into it because
your body weight weighs a lot and it's
always going to be even on bodyweight
stuff to warm it up first now that he's
going to be ultra warm we're gonna get
right into it and the pain begins and up
perfect that's it
all right wiggling out relax a little
bit think of happy feelings and then we
will begin the superset so we're going
to have you do as many of those pull-ups
as you can with good technique as many
dips as you can we're gonna let you rest
about 30 seconds okay and then we will
repeat the process several times until
you have begged us to stop please I want
to hear you say Mike and Jared and then
when I hear that I'll say that's Dr Mike
to you motherfucker we do not count reps
we only count quality
beautiful
perfect
oh yeah let's go more all fucking day
yes
full stretch once you control that go
last one here that's it that's it that's
it right in the dips
[Music]
a couple more
slow
good little deeper you got this we're
here to make it hard
more but you heard that before
slow
[Music]
good track good stuff wow wow zero
technique breakdown 30 seconds feeling
okay all right so far do you want like a
Viagra pill or a dick injection or
something I don't know how you people
work you know normally no it just makes
your face feel flush
oh yeah
cool oh shit yeah one more let's go all
the way come on come on control on the
way down good put your unlock your feet
unlock your feet for me push on me and
vote
control push back and go
one more oh yeah let's go man push slow
control unwrap
to the dips
come out by yourself
that's just so emasculating keep going
keep going
one more
control
push if you need to good stuff oh stuff
I should have pushed a little money
you fucking quit
yeah let's finish that one my man
go
come on
one more bonus round slow control stand
up motherfucker yes
assessed repetitions you can do them in
some situations
make sure you're counting them properly
so if you have a log book you count the
ones you did and the ones you got
assistance with it's not always the
right thing but if you want more volume
of work if you don't have an assistant
to pull up or Dent machine it's a way to
make sure that the individual does more
repetitions we're trying to get at least
five percent he's pretty beat up already
so I'm gonna come in and let him do as
many reps he can in his own and then get
in there he's gonna be pushing back with
his feet to extend himself he's going to
be using his legs against my frame to
help as much as possible it's actually
quite easy for me because he's just
extending his legs I just hold right
here he puts his legs here I don't have
to physically lift him up the partner
shouldn't be lifting you you use your
partner as a frame to lift yourself up
speaking of which what was it what we're
doing oh yeah that's right more sets
with one more slow deep press up press
oh
we beat that ass
beat that quick I'm out of shape that
was awesome
let's go do the next thing
[Music]
now it's Brian's turn to do some chest
pressing on the machine
superset it with some rowing on the
machine as well
we're using the Matrix equipment here at
Dragon's Lair it's honestly fucking
really good it costs like a trillion
dollars or some shit it's got a computer
in it but it is awesome the force curves
are great the smoothness is great I love
everything about it he's going to be
doing sets of 10 to 20 on the chest
press
sets of 10 to 20 on the row this is a
combination of essentially resistance
training work with kind of some cardio
work in as well because of the speed of
transition we do both we rest 30 seconds
we do both again you're going to see a
lot of load adjustment it's not just one
load the entire time you will be getting
tired the machines allow us the ability
to have the stability component taken
care of so you can just crank and also
the loading that we can choose to make
it easier and easier and easier loading
wise like lighter is a better term so
that you can get enough repetitions
every time to cause a lot of disruption
to the muscle and also burn lots of
calories to get his entrepreneur workout
going that's even really a thing all
right let's sketch the workout
right away right away right away no rest
we get the rest after crunch oh yes
two more
full range

the way down as soon as you've had
enough of those trying not to trip over
this thing okay you will sit down into
the seat
up chest up touch the dumbbells all the
way to your shoulders and go all the way

let's knock out three or four right away
and then rest with them on your
shoulders begin
[Music]
that's it let's go finish your arms off
it's time to finish this workout
with arms of course arms how are we
gonna let someone get out with her upper
body workout without pumped up arms you
finish off your arms you walk by the
girl who works at the front desk and
you're like Hey listen lady and she's
like I'm gonna cut you off give me your
number let's go have consensual sex
right now that's ideal how it works
anything down from there will still take
three sets cable curls superseditive
push Downs the rest Brian's upper body
is torched this is straightforward again
tired pissed pumped frustrated I want to
be out of here still good technique
every single rep the great thing about
cables is you can reduce load every time
to stay in that 10 to 20 rep range let's
get it done
good more more Brian you got this
big curls
each other
one more yeah let's go come on come on
come on good technique
oh shit another one man you got some
rest yeah
[Music]
fuck yeah good one more all the way up
that's it rack
push Downs time right away right into it
notice we're kind of swapping if it's
just around we did a pull first then a
push then a push first then a pull
that's one way you can do these you're
not really going to be able to emphasize
anything directly so like if you want a
bigger back but this is all you can do
probably have the best time to do an
emphasis Block in your training so when
you do any kind of antagonistic workout
do one thing first and the next so for
this we hit the hell out of the triceps
with the pushing exercises and the
upright rows and the military press
superset whenever he's doing military
press was a lot of tricep the pushing
exercise was a lot of tricep we haven't
really done too much biceps so we're
gonna do biceps first here intentionally
that way he's not too toast to do a
bunch of reps because if you're trying
to do you guys have seen me do it on the
channel if you're trying to do a bunch
of curls after a push down probably not
going to happen so biceps first since
the triceps have gotten hit pretty well
and then triceps to finish up
push good again slow no brakes push
that's it and rack
good right over right into curls hit it
three two more
let's go oh shit yeah all the way up to
the lock all the way up
come on all the way up oh what was that

five good one last one everything you've
got stay with it
