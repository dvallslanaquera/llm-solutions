if we cut carbs we cut a major fuel
source for hard workouts a major fuel
source for recovery and a major
macronutrient that promotes
anti-catabolism which is also known as
sparing muscle loss okay so carbs
literally give you a ton of energy to
train lots of ability to recover they
actually even promote deep sleep and
they give you this weapon against muscle
loss the thing is past a certain point
fats don't really do all that stuff
nearly as well or not at all
