hey youtube dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization as
always today's
deep dive advanced training topic is
going to be
different frequencies for different
muscles
and specifically why the same training
frequency per week
might not be optimal if you use it for
all the muscles in your body that you're
trying to get
more jacked so
stimulus recovery adaptation principle
of training
is quite simple okay you stimulate
growth
with a workout you recover and adapt
and then you repeat really
straightforward
not rocket science this can be done for
any muscle
you can hit your quads or hit your
biceps you can hit them both
they recover and they grow and then you
hit them again problem solved
so what the hell is the actual problem
here well
not all muscles heal at the same rate
for example quads versus biceps
if you train both of them with the same
amount of relative volume number of sets
let's say we do you know same workout
just a strange workout but
it's a thought experiment six sets of
biceps to failure
and then six sets of quad work to
failure right so everything's
standardized success to failure both
both sides and what is the prediction
there for most folks
even the biceps can be recovered to
train hard again
in maybe two days you know six sets of
biceps just not right
something to write home about maybe two
maybe three days they'll be ready
um quads might take three or four days
to recover
but maybe even longer i mean six sets of
quads to failure can
trash you and the bigger and stronger
your biceps and quads are
the more that asymmetry grows because
your biceps get pretty big but your
quads can get huge and
large muscles just generally tend to
take longer to recover
so here's the problem if you hit all of
your muscles with
roughly the same relative volume you're
either rushing back in to train some
muscles too soon so for example monday
wednesday
friday you have biceps and quads right
just as an example
if you do six sets to failure each day
which is fine
uh your biceps are recovered on time
every time and there's great workouts
but your quads are never recovered
because they're just not ready and then
you're rushing in way too soon to hit
your quads
and you say ah gee you know this is way
too much
uh i'm gonna train my biceps and my
quads only twice a week six that's the
failure monday thursday
you do it like that and your quads are
recovered on time every time great
uh but your biceps are recovered like
days ahead of each one you could be like
you know
i could be training them they could be
growing more but i'm not
because i'm just killing time just to
try to get them on the same split as
my quads going to suffer one way or
another if the recovery time is off
right so you can kind of solve this
problem
without altering frequency by maybe
altering the per
session volume say okay my biceps
you know from six sets they get a decent
workout but my quads is just a ton
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna train
biceps with eight sets
quads with four that way quads don't get
super disrupted they heal after three
days
biceps eight sets gets super disruptive
they heal after three days boom i can do
quads biceps quad biceps and i never
have to do
any kind of weird split where the
frequencies are different
in a technical sense you essentially
could potentially train your quads like
one third of the way between their
minimum effective volume and maximum
recoverable like right over here
and you train your biceps something like
two-thirds of the way between minimum
effect of maximum recoverable much close
to maximum recoverable like eight sets
of biceps is a serious work
right that way the stimulus recovery
adaptation curves line up
and you can have the same training
frequency that's a potential solution
okay now this solution is
fine it's fine but it has some serious
drawbacks
first of all you probably have to
recycle the biceps
lower the volume take a recovery phase
and then start from lower volume and
start building back up again
multiple times in the mesocycle because
if you start training them so close to
the maximum recovery volume they're
going to overreach before
quads overreach for sure because quads
are being trained in a much more
reasonable way
so you got to get really funky if
someone's like okay you're going to
train biceps heartily like no my biceps
are toast like what are they toes like
to be so like yeah
but in order to train them as often as i
train my quads i have to torch them
every time and they just run out of
steam like okay that kind of sucks right
um another problem is remember you're
not just pushing your biceps far ahead
in the solution
you're you're holding your quads back
you may never get
optimal quad growth by just holding them
to like four sets per session every time
that just might not be anywhere close to
the maximum recovery volume
so you could never heal on time and you
just essentially potentially
leaving uh quad growth on the table
because you're holding them back just to
recover at this arbitrary rate scaled to
your biceps right
um and another problem for the biceps is
if you train them very very hard
8 sets 10 sets 12 sets per session to
get them to heal at the same time as
your
quads you might actually be doing so
much damage in each session that the
damage interferes with the amount of
adaptation this has been shown in a few
studies now
if you get torch a muscle in a session
at past a certain point for many muscles
that's like 10 sets per session
close to failure you're probably doing a
little bit more harm and good the
further above that you go
so another if you're in an extreme case
and your quads really take a while to
heal
and your biceps uh you know sort of
don't if you start pounding your biceps
like crazy just a few times a week
these could be sub-optimal low-quality
workouts where
part of the workout gets the biceps
growing and the other part of it gets
the biceps shrinking because it's that
much damage each time
to get them to heal on time you end up
having them heal more damage
rather than collect more of the gains
it's a bad bad deal
okay in addition to that you could be if
you train biceps with a higher frequency
you could be making great gains training
close to their minimum effective volume
that's not an option for you because you
want to heal right on time every single
time
this problem this is kind of stupid
analogy but by now you guys know i'm
good for stupid
analogies if you and your friend are
going to try
you're trying to go to the dentist's
office at the same time you're trying to
get there at the same time and leave
roughly at the same time
without like a ton of someone waiting in
the waiting room or pacing in the
parking lot
that's definitely possible if you have
the same procedure or similar procedure
and there's multiple dentists and
dental assistants in the office but
think of it this way if your friend
is scheduled for a root canal and you're
scheduled for a regular
teeth cleaning like you know man there's
just no way to rush a tooth canal
or a russian root canal uh in in
there's no way to in how long can an
assistant clean your teeth for
you know you can't sit down in a dental
assistant's chair and be like hey my
buddy's in the other room getting root
canal it's gonna take three hours so
go ahead and clean my teeth for three
hours she's gonna be like this is a 20
minute procedure like well i guess you
got you know
you're gonna be cleaning my teeth a lot
more they're gonna be extra clean right
that just doesn't work like that
there's a certain amount of alignment
that's wildly inconvenient for everyone
it's not optimal
maybe it's just better to have different
schedule maybe if you want to leave with
your friend at the same time from the
dentist's office
you can get there much later than them
while they're getting their root canal
for them
and then leave at the same time
something like that so in much the same
way
the best approach ideally in training is
if you have muscles
that are faster or slower healing you
can probably just train them with
slightly different frequencies
for example quads twice a week because
they take half a week to heal from just
a decent workout
and then biceps maybe four times a week
right that way
you get the best training for both and
there are no sacrifices made one way or
another the only sacrifice is your
schedule is a little bit more
complicated but look if you want optimum
results
maybe a little bit of complexity can go
a long way right
in other words your frequency for any
muscle
should be derived from how long it takes
for the muscle to recover
from getting hit really really hard in
its own right not compared to other
muscles okay with its own number of sets
that it needs to get hit hard
seeing how long it takes to recover and
repeating and not
top-down arbitrary uh patterns folks
will ask me on youtube and instagram and
stuff like hey
you know should i be training my quads
four times a week the only like number
one thing i always want to reply with is
like two factors one
the do you know your volume that it
takes to get a high quality quad workout
maybe they do if they don't they gotta
step back and
look at that once you know that volume
my question to you is
can you recover from that volume four
times a week and a lot of times i get
the answer of like well no i don't think
so it's like
what the hell are you doing like if
someone asked like hey to get big should
i eat
five 2 000 calorie meals per day my two
questions would be
is 2000 calories the meal size you need
to drive anabolism and can you
comfortably finish that to be like no
okay first of all that's wrong but
second of all
let's say they say yeah i can eat 2000
calories in one sitting i'm like sweet
can you do that five times a day and
they'd be like no absolutely not well
then of course the answer is no right
so frequency should be derived based on
if you hit the muscle hard
how long does it take to recover and
that's the frequency it's not
something you just say i'm going to
train biceps five times a week well
maybe that's an option maybe that's
great and maybe that's totally wrong
you can't tell you have to look at your
own body's responses right
now that doesn't mean that you train
every single
muscle group with a completely different
frequency or like a drain form six days
a week
delts five biceps four triceps three
quads two and chest one like
okay that's a real advanced program no
potentially it's something you can put
in excel
you can show up to the gym and you have
it on the sheet you just do what it says
maybe
sure but really a lot of times it's just
kind of
two two-option system covers a lot of
ground and you can nudge the
volumes a little bit to make up the rest
so you could have like a two versus
three x muscle group split
or like a two versus four x so two
versus four is really good because like
the slower healing half of your body you
can train twice a week
and then the faster healing half of your
body or whatever fraction of your body
heals faster
you can trade four times a week and you
know to make up the ground you can do a
little bit of
increasing volume decreasing you just
don't want to do that too much per
session to throw off
mvv's and mrvs so essentially just
having a bifurcated process where you
have a higher frequency approach and a
lower frequency approach
then it's easy to program because you
just make two little boxes before you
start writing a program
higher frequency muscles i got to fit
these in four times a week lower
frequency i gotta fit this in two times
and then
you make a program that's it you don't
have to look at each muscle and get all
super advanced this is a totally awesome
option
you can absolutely do so
the best approach here is
generally speaking bigger stronger
muscles
that are positioned in your body
biomechanically
for extreme lengthening okay usually
take longer to heal from any given
stimulus which means
that muscles for most people not all
like the biceps
like the delts like the calves like the
mid-back like the forearms
can heal relatively rapidly from a given
number of sets
whereas for most people quads
hamstrings chest triceps sometimes
glutes depending which exercises you
select
can heal more slowly okay for all those
reasons that they're positioned
differently and they're larger and
stronger and so on and so forth right
like your glutes are fucking enormous
you can't expect your glutes to recover
as fast as your forearms i don't know
what you do for recreational activity
but your forms are not supposed to be
as big as your glutes god damn it so
that's the kicker and we shouldn't
expect muscles to recover at the same
time that would be insane
now these are just general
recommendations for you to give some
thought to
i am not saying that in every case these
muscles that we said heal faster heal
faster and slower heal slower absolutely
not
it all comes down to your own healing
times
based on your own metrics does your
soreness disappear after a certain
number of days
does your performance return back to
normal or above if those
are yes then you are recovered then you
can train again
if those are no do not try to fit this
into this box if you train your
hamstrings
hard properly and after one or two days
they're back to performance and they're
not sore
yeah you can train your hamstrings four
times a week totally
and if you train your biceps and they
get mondo doms
and you can barely move them and your
strength doesn't return for three or
four days
don't trade biceps four times a week
train them twice that's totally fine but
only
you can find that out nobody else can
for you and you can read it on here and
get some ideas so you don't just guess
randomly
but at the end of the day it's all about
how your recovery goes itself
now you don't have to do this again this
is for more advanced folks it's more
complicated it's more nuanced this is
nerd bullshit you signed up for when you
click subscribe on our channel
you can train everything two times a
week or three times a week or whatever
all muscles and it works
fine it works really well but give it
some thought
there's a slightly more complex at least
bifurcated approach of
higher frequency and a lower frequency
option depending on which muscles heal
faster or slower
especially if some of your muscles seem
to respond
really well to whatever frequency let's
say you're doing three times a week now
some of your muscles respond really well
and others not so much they're not
growing much
they're getting into recovery problems
or you can definitely feel like you can
train them more but there's only so much
you can do in a session
and you know like man if i just had more
sessions i could really hammer this
muscle
do you have those suspicions maybe get
away from three times a week for
everything
try two and four give it some thought
