I walk into the supplement store and
there's hundreds and potentially
thousands of different pills and potions
and powders the vast majority of those
unless they're like whey protein casing
protein creatine etc those big
Blockbuster items they actually don't
help you do diddly dick as Dr James
Hoffman would say and that really just
sucks so like you know when you go buy
stuff at the health food store all those
weird supplements with weird names they
almost always do nothing at all they do
make you poorer because you give away
your money to have them
