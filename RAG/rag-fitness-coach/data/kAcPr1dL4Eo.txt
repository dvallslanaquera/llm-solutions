yeah just lay down
[Music]
I can't see it sorry guys I'm dying
like I said you're sucking too much dick
hey guys we are at the Dragon's Lair
yeah that was a shitty Dragon sign
ostensibly there would be fire coming
out of my mouth this is Trisha she is a
bikini Pro
I'm a bikini pro at heart she's a bikini
Pro in real life the judges had a
critique for her her glutes were too big
which is interesting wear your hair and
her quads could use some work and so
could her hamstrings by a little so
today we're going to be smashing her
quads we're gonna be kicking her
hamstrings and also Jared's here and
Jared lost his voice doing Las Vegas
things good God knows what it is only
God does know the devil also probably
does anyway
um we are going to be doing a quad
compound isolation compound sandwich do
you like sandwiches I love sandwiches
what's your favorite kind of sandwich
ooh bunnies on me excellent insert every
predictable stereotype you could let's
go train quads and hamstrings
[Music]
foreign
Dragon's Lair always has the best music
I feel like I'm at a rock and or rap
concert 10 a.m which
shit
has a lot of spots anyways
what we are doing is squats first duh
and it's going to be a five to ten rep
range probably three or four working
sets always a control B Centric very
likely going to implement a pause
potentially not we'll see what Jared
says and uh first quad movement for
someone without a huge systemic mrv
problem and usually bikini girls don't
have those we start with squats because
we just fucking boom quads to the face
let's do it all right you just keep
squatting okay toes out a little more
great nice and slow all the way down for
a full stop
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
just like that all of them let's go
you do an unbelievable work here big
chest
stand straight up not over up Squad
Squad again
go
chest up chest up chest up
up
one more last one go
big chest don't lean over stay upright
deep deep
go go go go go go wrap
and that's set number one oh my God good
stop you're doing great
that's the best Squad I've ever seen
right
that was only one
you're gonna as you come up you're gonna
wanna do this okay
it's gonna be easier to do that you'll
get more reps doing that but it's the
wrong thing in order for the quads to
take most of the load and keep your back
safe you want to stand straight up just
like that okay we made it heavier for
you it's supposed to be hard
chest Up Stand Up
good again
control
up
go go come on rest breathe
one more at least one more
go ahead
let's go Trisha make these count chest
up up come on up one more again right
now go go

holy caught me pause though
course
for once I feel yoked
[Music]
oh
oh hey guys I was just training my
glutes bikini competition Seasons coming
up and uh your girl likes to be prepared
that all aside I promised you guys we
were going to be doing the compound
isolation compound sandwich however we
got Trisha on the squat turns out the
super full ROM squat
fucked her up so bad that we're not
gonna do a sandwich because that could
lead to rap doing all these other bad
things it would just be too much so now
we're gonna do like three to five sets
of ultra deep Maya rep leg fests and
call it for quads or move out of him so
that's what we're doing so it's a 10 to
20.
Ultra range of motion Ultra control
Ultra technique monster ultra zero huh
let's do it
no need to pause reverse right out or go
deep foreign
keep going we're right here spotting you
do your best
[Music]
eleven again let's go all day all day
Trisha let's go
was that 12. keep going come on
we're gonna get to 15. we're gonna
fucking get to 15. go go oh yeah 13 down
come on
deep deals down we're right here you're
good speed yeah round
[Music]
oh my God
you will be sore
promise
JK you are sore see I knew that oh good
stuff very good
on the next one basically you're gonna
do my reps so you're gonna do like one
from bail and then you're gonna pause at
the top and you're not gonna rack it
you're just gonna pause
and then you're gonna go again pretty
close to failure until you get to 15.
so it's gonna suck
you get some rest
deep
up up up
rest breathe breathe come on lock them
out really quick lock them out gently
three let's go
last three planets
right here you go
slow deep

I can't tell if you're trying to get out
or not
good luck
this one is floss
as soon as you finish this set of 15
we're gonna ask you to come out and
stand facing that way right here and
you're gonna go like this and you're
going to do exactly the squats you did
there except with no weight and we're
going to ask you to hold it in various
positions you just keep going until you
stop okay

are you crying
we don't cry in professional
bodybuilding
[Music]
is it weird to not have legs yeah
all right hamstrings
[Music]
Patricia's quads are kind of done she
did three sets of squats
three sets of leg press one set of drop
set super psycho crazy squats after
quads are cooked hamstring time we're
gonna do lying leg curls sets of 10 to
20 reps we're gonna do the mile rep
match system which is you get a certain
number of leg curls in a first set close
to fail
rest the normal amount second set you
have to get that exact same number no
many no matter how many three to five
second my rep breaks you take within
that set to get to the total we're
probably gonna do three or four of those
and then call it a night and like push
Trish out of the gym and be like good
luck and she'll probably just fall down
oh my God that's heavy too heavy
huh she's not used to being forceful in
the way so yeah try to really power
professionally go
oh come on girl you straight and you
don't have to stop at the bottom just
touch your butt let it come back
downstairs slow good enough I got the
perfect weight you can rack and rest
the king of forearm Trevor Fulbright I
got this from him
you put the old pad on here and then you
get a way deeper stretch at the bottom
for hams which is critical the most
hypertrophic part probably of the whole
movement this is going to make it more
difficult be careful how many you put on
because you could hyper extend your knee
but if you warm up properly that won't
happen I'm no meteorologist but my
prediction pain
nine we gotta get 12.
10.
11.
12 more three more
thirteen almost there touch that butt
put some speed on it speed 14 last one
coming up Gentle Touch Speed 15 slow rap
