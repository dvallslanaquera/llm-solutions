hey folks dr mike here for renaissance

that's two words periodization's one

weird start
fatty food makes you fat is that true
or is it bullshit
let's find out
so
four points to consider
first
fats do have a lot of calories nine
calories per gram versus four for carbs
and four for proteins that's not that
great
and also fat is tasty as fuck
and thus it's pretty easy to eat in
large quantities i only have one thought
experiment for you
you're hungry and you have jar oh
crunchy peanut butter
in front of you and a spoon
and it is just a room with a very
comfortable chair
some sort of fluid for you to drink
crunchy peanut butter with a spoon in
there
and a
trillion cameras pointed at you some
truman show type of shit
what are you gonna do
uh yeah
boom gone five minutes i can take a
whole jar of peanut butter down no
problem it's all too easy you guys ever
try cashew butter
don't
if you haven't tried it yet don't this
is like me pulling pushing crack cocaine
on you
just just
zig the other way zig when you shoot a
zag don't get into it you'll be an
addict you'll be on the streets stabbing
motherfuckers for cashew nut butter it's
incredible so
valid points value points definitely
something for consideration however
it all comes down to calorie balance and
if you keep your protein stable
lower your carb intake you can raise
your fat intake pretty high even to
numbers per day like 200 grams per day
which look fucking scary on a macro
calculator but you will not gain fat you
will not gain weight you will not become
unhealthy you'll be as healthy as ever
eating tons of fats as long as you
compensate by lowering your carbs maybe
even your proteins so the calories are
to what your body needs and no more so
as long as you're not accidentally in a
calorie surplus fats are not inherently
obesiogenic as is the technical term
they're not inherently more prone to
make you fatter they're just not
and it doesn't matter what the fuck the
1980s food pyramid said you guys
remember that shit the food guide
pyramid had uh
fats and sweets eat sparingly that's
where i learned that term at the top
which is probably true fats oils and
sweets but at the bottom it had like
rice and potatoes and pasta and then the
fruits were like way at the top
apparently you didn't eat that many and
vegetables were somewhere in there so
and it said you know like fats are very
very bad and the thing is is that if you
look at the pyramid you can expand how
many fats you eat if you just contract
how many you know pounds of grains you
eat that day it's all about balance fat
isn't inherently fattening just like
none of the other macronutrients are
inherently fattening
another situation that comes up is a lot
of times people say like oh well you
know they're eating a fitness healthy
lifestyle and they say well i i can't
have salmon uh salmon's too fatty
and
uh okay is that because it doesn't fit
your macros for the day total respect if
you're doing a low fat diet but if it
does fit your macros for the day
especially if you slide your carbs down
and your fats up um
then it's fine but i think a lot of
people when they look at salmon and
they're like 32 grams of protein sweet
16 grams of fat whoa that's crazy well
there's nothing crazy about it if you
can lower your carbs and or protein and
make room for that fat it's super
healthy and it's not going to make you
any fatter it's just not it's all about
the calorie surplus but if your diet
isn't in a net surplus there's no way
any amount of fat that doesn't generate
that nut surplus will make you fat it's
just not possible
so if you account for the calories fatty
food doesn't make you any other
any fatter than any other food in almost
every case
and thinking that fatty food must make
you fat and then avoiding it on purpose
is bullshit
what do you guys think of my arnold
impression
uh i'll give you some options
amazing
is that arnold himself
okay good enough for a laugh
bro
can you just like not
because you're just like stop
that's one that's one category and
dude seriously like
don't this is ruining your channel and
your reputation and like your bullshit
starting to believe your own fucking
farts don't smell comedian shit
don't fucking make any impression just
give us the science shut up in science
