[Music]
you're pulling a charlie right now
[Music]
[Applause]
chris duffin joe sullivan they're really
strong
really strong we're talking about lifts
squatting in the 800 to 1000 plus range
deadlifting in that range as well
completely insane shit
but they don't have a whole lot of
experience doing hypertrophy work chris
is kind of retired from active strength
sport and karate kicking people in the
face it's just been a little while since
these trained legs
which will be some combination of this
is why we're taking it
easy on him and also why he may die at
the end of this video
joe has no jared is joe gonna survive
oh also gonna die at the end of the
video let's find out
[Music]
first exercise is the seated leg curl
really straightforward which is
targeting the hamstrings no magic here
it's important to get really settled
into the machine make sure that clamp
really secures your upper thighs so
you're not
jiggling around a lot and you can really
exert force through the hamstrings
full range of motion every time we want
to clank touch the bottom of the machine
every time
and then slowly exaggerate the eccentric
to get a full stretch because the
stretch is a huge huge part
of what engages hypertrophy especially
in hamstring training
it's not about losing a ton of weight
it's about putting in high quality reps
getting close to failure
while having good technique these guys
have super strong hamstrings you're
going to notice they're not using an
infinite amount of weight because doing
it right
is way better than just moving around a
ton of weight we're going to do
a few sets auto regulator of course
based on how nasty the pump is how
little they can move
and the rep range is going to be my rep
style for both of these exercises by the
way
10 to 20 reps so we're gonna hit
something like 10 to 15
they're gonna rest two or three seconds
and they're gonna keep going and going
and going
until they get oh 20 maybe even a little
bit more reps over that
that's just one set really milking
everything up do you have to train this
way no
but it's a cool way to train and sure as
hell messes you up can we
can i swear you fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck
hey look it's rp's derek wilcox
three three yep
[Music]
good very good
all right drop set okay nice same exact
cadence and everything just do as many
as you can
you might want to produce a little bit
less concentric velocity because you
might break the fucking machine with
just as much weight but
[Music]
i feel badass yes
go ahead whenever you're ready
perfect two four
five keep going
[Music]
oh yeah a couple more good
[Music]
let's go chris control
one more you got one more let's go
yes good you want more
go fuck it good touch every time
and then control the slow slow and then
down fast
that's it that's good
[Music]
good one more touch
one more last one touch
yes one more let's go
and that's it very good very good very
good
good luck on your walk with your wife so
um
we're gonna push it really hard but i
know you're game
good to go begin doing leg curls
[Music]
try to milk that eccentric no matter
what
control out of the hole there it is
sure two gentle touch
three it's okay if it doesn't clank
every time just every other time good
four five
rest brief five
one two
three touch four
all the way good slow
rest
go three one beautiful
touch power two last one
go rest
one and done
good that's it that's it
feel okay time to go half squat this is
where the uh
the fun really begins
[Music]
dumbest shit of all time
the easiest part of the exercise isn't
easy enough brother
yeah do you want to pause on these pause
every time three down pause and then
just concentric forceful concentric yeah
so
you obviously hips open just like a
regular squat boom
one two three balls
multiple sets for chris we're going to
do just single sets at a time because he
hasn't been training in a while
for joe we're going to do my reps these
guys are really really strong
we're going to ease them in warm them up
nice and slow sets
of 10 to 20 total with bioreps included
slow on the way down full pause hold for
a second
and then come all the way up that's
quality work
we're gonna make sure that their feet
are as close to themselves as possible
so if they're getting all the force
transduction through their quads
and not much of anything else this is
going to be fucking brutal
we're going to do a few straight sets
and then at least for joe he's getting a
crazy psycho drop set
yes yes go go
go go beautiful that's good stuff
good shit good stuff
slow and controlled let's go
beautiful joe
good shit someone fart stuff good
i'll let him out on basically everywhere
you're fine
[Music]
good all the way down for that nice
little plank that gentle flank at the
bottom
[Music]
yes good that's three
two more and then we take a break
big push good one more
way to control it
[Music]

here with you
control no fuckery
big push stand up go
charlie right now yeah
he's doing a drop set after this it's
not going to be fun
we'll have him do the uh bodyweight
spots after the problem
same as always and then at the top
you're gonna pause for a little bit
we're gonna say hold it we're gonna take
weights off we're gonna say go again
