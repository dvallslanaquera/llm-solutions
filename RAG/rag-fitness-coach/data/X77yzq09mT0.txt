hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization rp plus rpu
lecture seven adjusting timing food
composition and supplements
during your fat loss diet so we know the
basics of how these things work let's
talk about how we're going to adjust
them as we move through the diet we're
going to start with timing adjustments
here it's super important to say the
following up front
we have a situation where we already
know optimal timing and how it should
work from earlier lectures
these adjustments we're going to make
now are not for optimum nutritional
physiological timing usually they're
more for real world concerns
practical considerations and to deal
with psychology and hunger
so timing number one kind of adjustment
you might do
is you might eat later after waking than
normal
typically on a maintenance phase on a
muscle gain phase
you might wake up and then in 15 minutes
have breakfast
but a lot of folks seem to not be super
hungry in the morning some people are
very hungry in the morning and
they would never do this but some
individuals can wake up and for gee at
least an hour maybe two maybe
longer just really not want to eat now
here's the thing
you have a certain amount of calories to
squeeze into your day and as you
cut those calories hunger can really
start to skyrocket
but if you make your day of eating
shorter
by condensing the calories into a
shorter time span you will be less
hungry during that time
but you could say of course but you'll
be more hungry during the time that
you're not eating
yeah unless that time's in the morning
you're just not a morning eater anyway
imagine how ridiculous it is to wake up
and eat oatmeal and eggs and turkey
bacon and stuff yourself
and then later in the middle of the day
be starving to death and have your
chicken breast
and rice and you're like damn it i wish
i had double this wouldn't it be cool
to move your breakfast up two hours so
that you're full for longer
so that by the time it comes to eat your
chicken breast and rice you can eat it
two hours earlier and be like oh wow i'm
not even like super
hungry for my last meal it's time to eat
my chicken and rice and then you're
never really hungry during the day or
much less so
so sometimes what you can do is eat
later after you wake up
and that way you give yourself a buffer
zone
of uh not having to be as hungry right
because you might be a little hungry
even an hour or two after you wake up
but you can bear it another cool thing
psychologically
which starts to work pretty well for
many people
is the idea of front loading difficulty
this is something that actually i think
works in life in general
get the tough stuff done early so that
the day gets better as it goes
if you eat a crapload most of your food
early in the day
and then you eat less and less food as
you as the day goes on you like have to
look forward to more and more misery
it's hard to get motivated like that
it's easy to crack you sort of start to
get hungry at 5 00 pm and you know for
fact you don't go to bed until 11
you're like if i'm hungry now by 11 i'm
gonna be eating my own limbs and then to
drive by pizza place and you're like you
know what fuck it fuck this diet i'm
just gonna eat pizza
let's i'm only alive once shorter time
if i eat pizza too much but
uh so that's definitely a consideration
but here's the thing if you wake up and
you're already kind of like nah i could
just eat or not eat and you
don't eat for an hour and that's okay
but you don't eat for another hour
and you're a little hungry when you
start eating you're like oh wow like i
already put in two hours of not eating
this is sweet
the rest of the day is easier so when
you wake up
and you know you have two hours ahead of
you to not eat you're like
psychologically it works because you're
like sweet let's get this
done and then i and then things get
easier
right almost any time that you're
involved in something
difficult it's usually best of course
after a little warm-up period
to get the hard stuff done early right
so that you can not
coast all the way through but it's super
motivating to know that every bit of
work you do it's
just gonna get easier from here on in
versus get harder
right so that's a big deal is it going
to alter
the optimality of your nutrient
partitioning so on and so forth yes
sure it's going to cause a little bit
more muscle loss risk but remember
nothing beats adherence and if your
hunger is getting so intense that it's
getting to adherence problems or setting
some up for the after the diet period
that's totally worth it to move the meal
by a couple hours here and there so
that's the last time
actually in this entire talk i'm going
to address the optimality trade-off yes
for all of these adjustments they're
optimality trade-offs but they're
usually
really really small and the adherence
and hunger benefits that you gain are
usually really really big
so if you don't have hunger problems or
adherence problems
don't do any of these don't adjust any
of these but if you do especially if
they're moderate to severe problems with
hunger and adherence
for sure make these adjustments because
they're worth it nobody cares if you
traded off a a quarter of a pound of
muscle on your diet
you lost 20 pounds of fat because you
managed hunger properly versus if you
didn't lose that quarter pound of muscle
but you lost
only eight pounds because you have
failed halfway through the diet right
really really big difference point
number two where you can alter is you
can eat closer to workouts
that is you have a workout here here's
the beginning of the day instead of
eating here you might be able to eat
here why
because sometimes eating closer to
workout especially if you're running on
empty can give you just enough energy to
have a really really good workout
normally your glycogen is full you're
not starving to death you're on a muscle
gain plan or maintenance plan
eating three hours before workout you
have tons of energy plus you're eating a
lot of food
and if you eat any closer than three
hours you might just throw up all over
the place
but now that you've been dieting for a
while you might take that three hour
window and close it to two hours
because if you try to eat three hours
away by the time one hour
away or the workout got in you're
starving and you're low on energy
because your body has burned through all
that food it's less foods it's easier to
burn through
and your glycogen levels aren't as full
and your hunger hormones are going crazy
so if you move it to two hours you might
still have lots of energy have a great
workout
and then great workouts fuel better fat
loss muscle retention so on and so forth
so that's definitely an option
another thing you can do is you can
remove the workout shake
it's point number three completely and
use whole food instead that doesn't mean
you eat a carrot
and a piece of chicken during your
workout you just don't have an intro
workout shake anymore
remember intro workout shakes are tiny
optimality increaser
they increase by a fraction of several
several percentage points at the most
at the most usually a fraction of a
percentage point and it's nice to have
right but when you need calories to keep
you not hungry
wasting them on liquid protein and
liquid carbs in your workouts remember
you're not hungry in your workouts
anyway your sympathetic nervous system
fight or flight is driving
you're not hungry you're you're working
right and for a couple of hours after
you're probably not hungry we'll get to
that in
in just a sec so basically
uh you're in a situation where you have
this 20 grams of protein and 30 grams of
carbs in your shake
you could use it for no good reason for
for the reason of optimizing your
workout that gives a tiny little bit of
percent improvement
during the workout or you could take the
20 grams of carbs sorry 20 grams of
protein
30 grams of carbs spread it to whole
foods to your other meals
maybe to the ones during which you're
most hungry and feel least full
and all of a sudden your overall daily
anti-hunger fight is much more enhanced
right because 30 grams of gatorade
disappears like it was never there
but 30 grams of carbs from small to
medium-sized apples is two apples you
add two apples to your brown rice with
your chicken breast
after your workout and you're like oh
man that was like tough to eat that was
really cool and you get an hour extra of
anti-hunger benefit
really really good consideration when
hunger starts to really take precedence
another one is eating later after
workouts so
post-workout ideally you want to get the
fuel in as sort of as soon as possible
anti-catabolism blah blah blah but
remember when adherence is a real
problem because hunger's insane
post-workout your sympathetic drive is
still elevated and all those
catecholamines and stuff they're still
in your bloodstream all those hormones
they give you that fight-or-flight
ability they're still pushing that
for gee you know at least half an hour
in some cases several hours especially
if it's a really difficult workout
so a lot of times you'll notice that
like uh on a muscle gain phase
you'll do your leg workout you'll come
home
you'll sit down for a meal and you're
like oh my god i can't believe i have to
eat this like i still want to throw up
i'm not hungry at all
and sometimes you'll shower first and
then by the time you're showered you're
like okay finally i can stuff this down
you sort of feel bad because like i
should have just eaten it right after
but i couldn't
on a fat loss phase you do the reverse
so you come home
and instead of looking at the meal you
go shower you clean yourself up you put
on deodorant you brush your teeth
whatever it is you do
um your friend texts you and you asks
you a question answer the question
instead of going right to get food about
an hour or so later
maybe a little more you'll be pretty
hungry but you'll have killed an hour of
not being hungry because you just post
workout you didn't rush to eat right
away
let's say that post-workout meal
normally occurs at 5 pm now you eat it
at 6 pm or 6 15
the next workout will suppose or next
meal is at 8 pm
you're usually ravenous by this meal
right but now this meal is at 6 15. by
the time you get to this meal at eight
you're actually sort of still a little
bit full from the last one
then you eat this meal at 8 pm and you
feel really full and everything's great
you say but hold on aren't you hungry
here no because you got the anti-workout
hunger
i'll put you this way if you're at any
point during a fat loss diet
stuffing yourself at one part of the day
and hungry in another part of the day
you could rebalance that so that you're
just comfortable all the time
that increases the sustainability of a
diet by a zillion
right give that some thought again only
if hunger is a really really big concern
on related to point number one reading
later after waking
a lot of people they're just not as
hungry in the morning and they get sort
of moderately hungry in the afternoon
and then their hunger peaks in the
evening hours that's
that's true for probably more people
than it's not so sometimes you can eat
more carbs and fats
in the pm and less than the am maybe you
would do this with moving meals around
like timing the meals to occur later
or even without it you could say instead
of like you go to the office and you're
super busy let's say you're an architect
you're doing all these plots you're
talking to management
and you know lunch comes up but it's
only 15 minute lunch because you've got
a client presentation
instead of like slogging through a bunch
of oatmeal and rice and chicken
you might just take two chicken breasts
with you with a couple of greens wolf
them down super quick you're super busy
or not hungry anyway
boom boom you get everything done and
then you come home at the end of the day
after your training
and you're like ravenous because you've
eaten not so much through the day
and it's the evening you get hungry
anyway and your post-workout but check
this out
you got all those carbs and fats that
you didn't eat for lunch and maybe the
other meals you eat throughout the day
you have them now in the evening and all
of a sudden you look at this meal and
you're like oh my god i have to eat 150
grams of carbs 25 grams of fat and
65 grams of protein that's like a
serious meal and especially if you use
foods we'll get to that in a bit in food
composition
that are really filling that is a huge
meal and you're going to feel like
you're not even dieting after that meal
you're gonna feel like that for
hours and hours and hours and then
you'll have your last meal of the
evening again which is pretty sizable
and you're like oh my god you're gonna
fall asleep with food in your stomach
and you're gonna sleep super well
because when you're satiated you sleep
way better than when you're hungry we'll
get to that point in just a bit as well
so it's a huge big win right so consider
you don't have to make this huge biasing
effort where you take your lunch and you
cut all the carbs and you put all these
carbs in the later meals
you can take your lunch and maybe cut
the carbs in half right and then add
half the carbs to
maybe your other meals or your
post-workout meal or something like that
so give that some thought
last point here on the timing
adjustments you in some
really extreme situations of really
radical hunger
can take your uh evening meal or evening
shake
and put it into the middle of the night
this occurs when you have just enough
food in the evening especially if you
buy some food in the evening
to where you're cutting anyway you're
working really hard you're really tired
and you don't have problems falling
asleep interestingly enough
fat loss dieters usually don't have
trouble falling asleep but sometimes
they have trouble staying asleep because
they literally wake up dreaming about
food and they wake up hungry
oh boy so what do you do then well
you're in a situation
where you have uh
fallen asleep you wake up
three and a half hours later it's two in
the morning
you're too hungry to go back to sleep
what are you supposed to do
the conventional answers if you've eaten
all your meals nothing but then you're
losing sleep remember losing sleep is
damn you're one of the worst things you
could do for your training for your diet
for your psychology for your longevity
and for sure for your fat loss
losing sleep is bad so what could you do
well you could take your normal shake
and instead of having a casein shake in
the evening with some nuts you take
those nuts
and you sprinkle them into casey and
pudding you save that
you take it in your fridge you put it in
your fridge if you don't wake up in the
middle of the night
no big deal you have you didn't eat an
extra whatever number of calories that
wasn't because you know it's close
enough on protein anyway you're not
going to lose any muscle you're fine
but if you do wake up in the middle of
the night and you're hungry all of a
sudden
you got maybe just casein or maybe if
you plant it this way casein with nuts
sprinkled in
and you can eat that and as soon as you
you're tired anyway you wake up the
middle of the night just hungry
as soon as you're not hungry anymore you
eat a nice meal of protein and fats
you're going to get real tired real
quick you're going to fall back asleep
you're going to sleep the rest of the
night you're gonna have excellent nights
sleep voila you wake up and repeat the
next day
again if you don't wake up in the middle
of the night super hungry and can't fall
asleep
unless you eat don't do this it's not
worth messing up your sleep
there's some theoretical reason to
believe that you might go
better with a fasting period every 24
hour cycle so you don't want to eat
around the clock which includes at night
maybe maybe but if it's costing you
sleep
this is an interesting strategy to try
i've done it numerous times it works
really really well
okay you did all your timing adjustments
how can you adjust food composition
as a fat loss diet progresses and gets
more difficult and
uh you want to usually
enhance performance or be able to combat
hunger
six ways to do this uh we talked about
this already for timing
because the intro workout shake stuff
goes to the other meals but basically
you remove shakes and use whole foods
instead whole foods are more filling
open and shut case when we're looking at
what your whole foods are
for the carbs you can start to eat more
veggies fruits and grains in that order
and fewer like way more veggies some
more fruits and a bit more grains
and fewer processed uh grains
things like you know white rice cream of
wheat etc those things are filling but
not nearly as filling as
uh fruits and veggies and whole grains
for example if you have 100 grams of
carbs to eat
in one of your meals if you eat it from
white rice man geez that's like a
you know two bowls of white rice like
little bowls to chinese restaurant
you're like you can eat 100 grams of
rice no problem you're like oh man like
when you're on a diet you still want
more food you're like i can eat
way more than this if you take
30 grams of carbs not fiber because
fiber is no calories
not weight but carbohydrate and you try
to eat that in
broccoli celery and spinach that's like
this much food and then
let's say you use fruits in addition to
that you can do two oranges
and then a bit of whole grain pasta
for you to eat all of that would take
like half an hour and your stomach would
be ballooned up and you'd be super full
for hours after
my god 100 grams of carbs is crazy right
that veggies fruits and grains are just
way more filling
so you can start out your maintenance
diet can be lots of all kinds of
carbs but you want to bias more into the
direction of these high fiber carbs
fruits veggies and whole grains as your
hunger gets more intense on a very
similar note
you can eat foods that are higher in
volume right because volume expands your
stomach and it signals it to really kind
of reduce hunger
so uh for example let's say you eat a
lot of dried fruit usually or dried
fruit is really really dense it has a
lot of carbs per
per cubic inch or cubic centimeter and
you know you eat it really quick and
boom you're 100 grams of carbs already
if you replace dried fruit with just say
fresh melon like fresh cantaloupe
100 grams of fresh cantaloupe is a bowl
roughly the size of cantaloupe it would
take you 20 minutes to eat and you're
like oh my god i swear to god i'm just
going to blow up
right and then hours after you're not
hungry and the meal is more enjoyable so
you get a huge stress reduction response
versus eating like this much dried fruit
and be like okay what's next
right when you're muscle gaining eating
a whole lot of dry fruit is great
because it gets you a ton of calories
real quick
when you're fat loss you want to eat the
opposite of dry fruit higher in volume a
lot of that volume comes from water
right and that is a huge huge
anti-hunger combatant
another option and these can all be done
at the same time or to some degree
so throughout your diet you can eat
foods higher on the satiety index
okay what does that mean well basically
foods that fill you up more
like it's been shown uh white potatoes
that are boiled
have a really high satiety per unit of
carbohydrate so if you eat like some
dried fruit you're like okay
uh yeah that was 50 grams of carbs and
people were like okay how full are you
like i don't know i could eat like way
more
you eat 50 grams of carbs from white
potatoes people like how full are you
you're like man i'm pretty full
right so you can actually see the
satiety index ranked a lot of it has to
do with what fruits veggies and whole
grains are almost all ranked really
really high in the satiety index
so you look at that and you pick the
foods that just are filling the most
the thing is you don't even have to look
up any research on that you already eat
a whole bunch of different kinds of
foods normally in your diet
you know some of them fill you up a lot
more than others so as you go through
the diet just eat more of the ones that
fill you up a lot
for the same amount of food and less of
the ones that don't probably one of the
worst satiny index foods
is potato chips cheeseburgers ice cream
junk foods you can eat a bowl of ben and
jerry's ice cream and just barely be
full and that's a thousand calories in
the whole
cheeseburger same idea how many potato
chips can you eat i don't know maybe an
infinity amount
right so it's one of those situations
where you kind of want to you know use
the foods
that fill you up the most less of the
ones that fill you up the least
huge huge word of warning you're going
to want to eat
the lowest satiety foods psychologically
your food-seeking behavior is going to
be elevated like crazy
cheeseburgers will never look as good as
they do on a diet
but you got to pick the foods that don't
quite look as good in order to eat your
best and here's the deal
super super ties in to point number five
eat foods lower in fprh food
palatability reward hypothesis basically
says
super tasty foods make you want to eat
more of them when you're on a fat loss
diet
super not so tasty foods you can eat and
just kind of get done so for example
a real easy example macros and calories
identical
do you choose flavored oatmeal or
unflavored oatmeal well when you
have trouble stuffing the oatmeal down
on your muscle gain plan flavored
when you're on maintenance whichever one
you like when you get deeper deeper in a
fat loss diet
if you flavor your oatmeal it's gonna
you're gonna finish the same amount of
oatmeal and because it's flavored
because it's tasty
your brain's like that was tasty we want
more of that and it's going to be really
really tough to resist the cravings
right you're just basically eating to
prime yourself it's like everything
turns into an appetizer
on the other hand if you eat foods that
are lower in fprh which doesn't mean
disgusting foods it means foods that are
just not exactly the most exciting thing
um the sort of most extreme i've gone
around the ph is i used to eat
cold oatmeal with cut up chicken breasts
and broccoli with salt on it like all
mixed together
it's something that on a muscle gain
phase i would straight up never eat i'd
be like i can't eat that i'm gonna throw
up on a cutting phase i was so starved
that that to me tasted not so bad but i
got usually three quarters of the way
through the meal and i was like man
i'm pretty good and then i just finished
the meal super slowly
and i wouldn't be hungry for a long time
i certainly wouldn't be rebound hungry
rebound hungry means like you eat half a
brownie and you want triple the amount
of brownie you wanted before
it would never be really hungry i would
eat the meal and i'd be like god i hope
i don't have to eat one of those anytime
soon
that's a real good place to be on a diet
again instinctually you're going to want
to eat brownies and not oatmeal chicken
breast and broccoli with salt
make the right decisions in advance meal
prep so you have the food available so
it's doing all the good stuff to you and
not making you
any more anxious and more crazy than you
have to be
lastly in this strategy maybe it isn't
super effective but it works to some
extent
is preload fluids before meals so
basically you sit down to eat a meal
take a glass of water chug that down it
fills up your stomach to some extent
then as you eat the meal
you get fuller earlier which means you
experience a good fullness sensation
if you're at a restaurant where it's
sort of like you can keep eating more
food or all you can eat
don't go to those when you're on a fat
loss phase but if you find yourself in
one have a bunch of water before you
start maybe a glass or two
then you can eat sort of quote-unquote
whenever you want and just start eating
food
you'll find yourself fuller a lot faster
right a lot sooner which means you won't
eat as much
really big help another one uh that i
have to mention because
uh it's it's uh an interesting uh
theoretical idea
i i there's not exactly research to
confirm this but this has worked for me
personally and for uh folks i've been
working with really really well
salt like if you eat plenty of salt uh
just salt your foods uh eat some soups
uh then on a fat loss diet you actually
because salt pulls in other water
you actually get more hydrated and you
get sort of kind of puffy and you get
really full and you don't want to eat
for that reason
but i think salt has a lot to do with
hunger signaling because some people
when they start to eat diet foods
they'll reduce the salt and then when
they crave foods they create really
salty foods a lot of which are junky
foods and are super delicious
if you eat bland chicken breast and an
oatmeal or something
you might still want like a cheeseburger
a chip something with salt
but if you eat that and salt it plenty
after you eat it you know
the macros are still pretty low and well
within your diet but you got so much
salt you had to drink a bunch of water
to wash it down you're like man
i just i i'm pretty good on that like i
don't need any more food and you don't
when you're not craving salty foods that
cuts out a whole bunch of junk foods
you could still crave sweet foods but
hey at least it's half the battle so
give that some thought
lastly supplement adjustments most
supplements stay exactly the same
right sometimes again from the past
slides you could cut out your protein
shakes cut out carbs
shakes and do whole foods but stimulants
are the
real big supplement you can potentially
adjust how
well if you adjust stimulants what you
should be doing
is incrementally increasing how much
stimulant you take as two things happen
one as the diet gets more intense you
need more energy from stimulating more
cognitive function enhancement
and you need more anti-hunger effect and
two
uh you get more and more used to the
amount of stimulant you're taking so for
that reason you need to tear your
stimulant use up
here's an example of how that might look
if you don't normally take stimulants
but you respond to them fine
weeks one and two of your fat loss diet
you can do nothing
or do green tea in the am just a cup of
green tea no big deal
weeks three and four you need a bit more
of a kick you're used to the green tea
you do green tea in the am
and you do green tea pre-workout this is
like if you work out in the afternoon
maybe
five pm or something weeks five through
six you need a bit more of a kick you
might do coffee in the am green tea
pre-workout
week seven through eight coffee in the
am and coffee pre-workout
weeks nine through ten coffee in the am
and then you might need to take
pre-workout powder before your workout
which is like the real deal you should
have a lot of stimulants in it really
get your kick in
and then weeks 11 through 12 to finish
off you do coffee and am
pre-workout powder and in the early pm
to get you your last bit of energy and
fight your hunger you might do green tea
notice you don't do like pre-workout
twice because you should never fall
asleep
so be very careful adjusting this to not
interfere with sleep cut your caffeine
earlier in the day but green tea early
in the pm
uh let's say you finish your workout you
take pre-workout at 2 p.m
you work out at 2 30 you finish at four
and then at 5 p.m
maybe you have some green tea and then
you finish off the evening
even some people are so caffeine
resistant at 8 pm they could have green
tea
it's just enough to fight out hunger a
little bit keep you awake not enough to
keep you awake for too long
and then when 11 rolls around because
you're pretty used to caffeine by this
point or just normally
that little cup of green tea is not
doing anything for you you have your
last nice big meal right from the
earlier adjustments
and you're not caffeined up you're super
satiated from your big meal
and you go to sleep you have great sleep
you wake up in the middle of the night
starving to death you got your casey and
pudding
with nuts in the fridge all these
adjustments keep you on track
adherence is number one if you use all
these tips or some of them
these are super super golden tips they
can super help you
and all of a sudden you're one step
ahead
you don't have as many breaks in the
diet or as many faults with a diet as
many cheat
accidental cheats maybe you have none
and then all of a sudden you've
accomplished what you need
after the diet is over you can keep all
of these things in place
but as you eat at maintenance and you
eat more and more calories each week as
your metabolism
revs back up then you can still pull the
plug on some of these you can
reintroduce workout shakes you can start
eating tastier foods slowly
so that as you come out of your diet
it's natural you're never super hungry
and all of a sudden you've got to 180
pounds you've been 180 for three or four
weeks now and all of a sudden it's
getting easier you can eat more normal
foods
and you've sustainably set yourself up
to keep off the weight
super big success that's it for this
lecture next time myths misconceptions
and special circumstances in fat loss
our last lecture for the series
folks i'll see you then
you
