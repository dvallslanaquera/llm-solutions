welcome back in today's video i'll be
talking about a few things
first up i'll be talking about why
exercise selection should be
individualized
secondly i'll be talking about why i
prefer to focus on border speed as
opposed to my muscle connection
thirdly i'll be talking about how
accurate people are gauging reps from
reserve
or how close they are to failure i'll
give a quick update on how my prep is
going
and finally i'll discuss ideas for
future videos
once this prep series is over or just
videos outside of the series i suppose
so first up
i want to talk about why exercise
selection should be individualized
now on principle
certain exercises have better stimulus
fatigue ratios
and or better perhaps feel than others
so for example
a full range of motion high bar squat
is likely better for quality growth than
a partial range of motion
light extension for a variety of reasons
that overall result in a better stimulus
fatigue ratio
for the quads for muscle growth in the
high bar squat
than in the partial range of motion by
extension
and on principle there are differences
however when it comes to individuals
that can vary for example if
a given person in my example um
i get hip flexor cramps
while doing sumo squats or smith machine
squats
and so while on principle those
exercises are
good choices for hepatrophy of the
glutes and quads respectively
they may not have a great sfr for me
personally and
in my case other exercises may be
superior
even though in principle they might not
be and so individualizing exercise
selection can be very important
let me give you another example um if
someone
has a really high perceived exertion
so if they find a certain exercise very
effortful psychologically
for example i find split squats
extremely fatiguing
in port because you have to do both legs
separately but i find i'm so fatiguing
personally that other exercises may have
a much better sfr
for the glutes advanced plate squats for
example
sumo squats or even deadlifts and so in
my case
specifically those exercises might be a
better choice than split squats
and i think that reasoning should apply
to all exercises
where on average some exercises have a
better sfr
but then when it comes to individual
some people have less
sfrs and better sfrs with different
exercises
and so you should always consider the
individuals sfr when
selecting exercises for a body part now
i want to talk about why i personally
prefer to focus on bar speed
as opposed to my must connection first
up
what am i talking about so during a set
or even doing a wrap
you can focus your mind or your
attention on
certain cues or certain aspects of a
lift
so something that bodybuilders have been
recommending for decades now i suspect
is focusing on the contraction of the
muscle
while you're lifting weights so for
example curls here
i'd be focusing on my bicep shortening
and lengthening
now there is some research in support of
this
but there isn't that much research yet
so there are a few studies i believe
where they compare
essentially muscle activation or emg
data when focusing on
mind muscle connection or feeling the
muscle contract versus
other hues like bar speed like being
explosive
and it seems like focusing on my muscle
connection might
enhance muscle activation but that
doesn't necessarily mean
that focusing on my muscle connection
will actually lead to enhanced muscle
growth
over the long term over a whole program
for example that is an inference that
people often make or an assumption that
people often make that isn't actually
warranted
the link between muscle activation emg
data
and muscle growth isn't as clear-cut or
consistent as people think
i'll post the paper in the description
if you'd like but essentially there are
a lot of assumptions you have to make
for the link between emg
data and muscle growth to be solid and
a lot of those assumptions just can't be
made with any confidence
and so emg data as a whole shouldn't be
used very much
to make exercise selection decisions
at any rate so there is some emg data
showing that focusing on this connection
might enhance
muscle activation however how does this
actually translate into the
long term or across whole program
there's been one study i believe
on mind muscle connection
and actual muscle growth and that was
conducted by brad schoenfeld
essentially my focusing on my muscle
connection
so focusing on the muscle contracting um
seemed to lead to slightly better muscle
growth in some muscle groups
than just focusing on bar speed so i'm
lifting the weights explosively and
forcefully
now that is one study
and it was in one the difference was
only significant in one muscle group
if i call correctly and so honestly i
wouldn't
put much weight into that just yet um
and that brings me to my own personal
experience with my musk connection
i for around maybe a year or so
i focused on my muscle connection during
all of my sets
um and the issue that i ran into
and that i think a lot of people run
into when focusing on my muscle
connection
is that
on my muscle connection makes it a lot
more difficult to reach
the target approximate failure if you're
only focused on how the muscle feels
you can lose sight of how hard you're
training
um whether or not you're getting
sufficiently close to failure
and in my experience and in some of my
clients experiences
focusing on my muscle connection can
detract from getting as close to failure
as you should be getting
and so an example
i remember doing face pulls one day uh
with dumbbells back when
lockdown was a thing and
i was focusing on my muscle connection i
was doing a working set um
i did something like 10 reps stop the
set
and then realized you know maybe i'm not
pushing myself as hard as i think i am
and so for the next set i decided to
focus more on
bar speed so just lifting the weight
explosively on the way
up and then controlling it down such
that the tempo
wouldn't change too much from when i was
focusing on my muscle connection
and so i did that and i got like 15
wraps so
an additional five wraps on top and
that sort of served as a wake-up call in
my case where
i just found that focusing on my muscle
connection
stopped me from going as close to
failure as i intended to and then when i
started focusing on water speed more so
that made it a lot easier to
get closer to failure and it just made
estimating failure
a lot easier and allowed me to
train harder make sure i was reaching
sufficiently close to failure and that
sort of thing
and so since then i've mostly focused on
board speed etc
i think one other reason that's a decent
option besides being able to gauge
failure more effectively
is also because if you've been training
for a while
and you've got good technique and
everything mind muscle connection just
comes naturally
like you'll have a pump you'll feel the
muscle working even if you
lift explosively you'll feel your bicep
contracting lengthening etc
and so i think focusing on memos
connection on top of that
maybe doesn't yield that much additional
growth if any
and i think it makes it a lot harder to
reach failure
or reach close to failure and so i
personally prefer
focusing on bar speed as opposed to
memos connection but if
you personally for example find that
you're able to
focus on my most connection and still
reach close to failure
then by all means keep doing it but it
might be worth experimenting with
focusing on bar speed instead and seeing
whether or not
you can actually do more reps than you
thought you could
next i wanted to talk about how accurate
people
actually are at gauging reps from
reserve or how close they are to failure
we actually and by we i mean some
colleagues of mine and myself
um recently pre-printed
a study pre-printing is just when you
essentially
publish not publish um
pre-publish a study as in before it's
published through a journal
you put the pdf version out there before
it's peer-reviewed just so people can
have access to it and read it
free of charge usually um
before the peer review process and
before the lengthy publication process
because publication can often take
months and months and so
delaying that process um delaying seeing
your paper out there
can be annoying and or delay science as
a whole
and so pre-printing your papers can be
useful anyways we put out a pre-print
on gauging reps and reserve and how
accurate people are at that
so essentially we did a meta-analysis on
all the available studies on estimating
russian reserve
so basically this is how it went
people were asked at some point during a
set say
after 10 reps to tell the researcher how
many more reps they could do
so for example let's say to 10 reps the
researcher asks me hey
how many reps can you do i shout out
five reps
and then i actually go to failure and
then
they compare how many reps you said you
could do
to how much you actually did eventually
when you went to failure
and then we took all of those studies
where they did this
and combined the results and found
that on average across all these studies
where people were asked to estimate reps
and reserve
and then actually went to failure under
the supervision of researchers
we found that on average across all
these studies people
underestimated how many more reps they
could do until failure by one
which means when people said they could
do four more reps
on average they could actually do five
more
it seems like the lighter a set is
so the higher reputation a set is the
worse people become at
estimating resonance of and the more
they underestimate
how many reps they can do so up until
around 15 reps
people are pretty accurate at gauging
rust from reserve but then above 15 reps
people get worse and worse at estimating
restaurant reserve
and so if there's one implication that
it's that when you're doing higher
repetition sets
you probably want to push yourself a bit
harder than you think you should
because at least on average most people
underestimate how many reps they can do
more
when they're doing high repetition sets
now the link to the study will be in the
description you can take a look
it's free of charge you can just
download it and read it
um but in general
for heavier sets people are more
accurate at predicting representative
and when the prediction is made later in
the set
so for example let's say you're doing a
set of ten
predicting how many more apps you can do
after seven reps
seems to be more accurate than doing it
after two which makes sense because as
you get closer and closer to failure
you should have a better idea of how
many works you can do
whereas if you just did your first rep
it's hard to tell okay how many more
apps can actually do
um so yes the link to that will be in
the bio
bio description sorry i'm to use
instagram
um so check it out next i want to give a
brief update on how that prep is going
currently as of this voiceover i am
just under 14 weeks out so i'm like 13
weeks out in five days
which is 96 days i think something like
that
um it's going pretty well i just started
the last
cut phase so i'll be cutting for four
weeks maintaining for one
cutting for four weeks maintaining for
one and then cutting for four more weeks
and so hopefully by then i should be
down to around 90 kilograms or 200
pounds
currently before i started this cut i
was around 99 kilograms
that was with a bit more food than usual
so i expect within a week or two i'll be
down to
96 or 97 and so i'll have around 12
weeks to lose
six or seven kilograms which should be
feasible
certainly um i plan on losing around
a bit above a pound per week which
should be
very feasible for muscle retention and
also just for hunger and stuff
i think initially i'll probably lose a
bit more weight as i'm
still 14 weeks out and then as i get
closer and closer to
the actual competition i'll have to slow
down the rate of weight loss
but overall prep is going pretty well
hunger is manageable
neat is manageable and yeah
i think i added some muscle to my chest
and arms during the specialization phase
that you're seeing right now
um but yeah i can't complain really
finally for the rest of this video i
wanted to ask a few things of you
um after this prep series is over
this contest prep series which will be
over
in late october so i'm competing on
october 31st
after the series is over i'll probably
start making
other videos so i think this is a good
start for youtube videos because it gets
me comfortable with
editing software um people can learn a
bit more about me as far as
contest prep my thoughts on training in
general because instagram doesn't always
serve as the best medium to
convey information especially in-depth
information
and so i think this is a good start but
eventually i want to make more
production heavy videos um
for now it's just a matter of
documenting my contest prep
but eventually i want to get into some
more
yeah production videos so a few ideas i
had already were
the basic basic uh
10 000 calorie 20 000 calorie challenges
so i think after my
show is done i'll do a
i've got three ideas so far a ten
thousand calorie challenge just
casually like eating whatever food i
want to eat
then one ten thousand calorie challenge
with quote unquote clean foods
which i realize isn't strictly defined
but basically just eating foods that
most people wouldn't consider
cheat foods i suppose um
and then finally a 20 000 calorie
challenge
as in in a day of course so those are my
three ideas for now
um which i'll all do after my show is
done
so yeah those are my three ideas i
probably
could come up with more but what i
wanted to ask of you
is if you have any videos you want to
see then please let me know
um i might start making more vlog type
content
down the road where i document what my
life is like
what i do in a day that sort of thing
it feels a bit weird given i don't think
my life is
all that entertaining or that
interesting but i realize
that's probably what most people think
before making day in the life
type content um
so yeah those are my main ideas for
content for now
um i'm getting better and better with
editing software
i've been taking a course on
adobe premiere pro adobe premiere pro
2021 which is what i'm using
um so i'm getting rid of that but i'm
also
not really using much of it yet because
for now i've been quite busy with
phd work coaching walk i'm moving places
in a week
i'm getting a car there's just been a
lot of admin stuff i'm also going on
holidays for 10 days
fairly soon so there's been a lot of
other stuff on my plate which means i
haven't been able to put that much
effort into these videos besides
you know doing a voiceover talking about
training
and then uploading them but soon enough
i'll put more
production effort into these videos and
yeah that should be interesting um but
that's about it for this video if i'm
being honest
i think i discussed everything i want to
say i'll try and start
time stamping these so people can just
access the topics they're interested in
i might also eventually start a podcast
but that's
still in the works um but yeah
please let me know any suggestions for
future videos
like challenges or
informative videos like science-based
videos or anything else you want to see
please put them in the comments and i'll
make sure to get them
in the meantime if you enjoyed this
video please comment
like subscribe it helps out and i'll see
you again next week
