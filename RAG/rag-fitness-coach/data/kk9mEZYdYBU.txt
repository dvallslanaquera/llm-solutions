somebody is going from a super massive
cutting diet into maintenance or trying
to get out of that super harsh low body
fat percentage drone that percent gain
is absolutely fine right out of
the gate like the reverse dieting stuff
is silly you don't need to do it you can
go ahead and try to get your body fat
back up from like five percent to eight
or nine percent right away that's
absolutely okay and if you're just
coming out of a diet and you're super
 lean go ahead and get your body
fat back up to a healthy percentage it's
a pretty intelligent idea
