hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization and today's bs topic is
primal
oh boy
oh boy oh boy
so a note to myself in this video is for
me to start the video with what's up
primals jk that's fucking stupid why is
it stupid you may ask
here's the thing
i don't know what the fuck primal means
there's a primal lifestyle primal
philosophy and i think it means like
ancestral like what our ancestors used
to do back in the idyllic times when we
were all healthy and our chakras were
aligned
except that's all a crock of shit here's
why
our ancestors eating in activity
patterns were incredibly varied you
would think that's true because some of
us trace our ancestry to north america
like native americans other
facial ancestry to the korean peninsula
others to the
southernmost tip of africa and others to
the northernmost part of norway
you guys think people evolving in those
environments ate the same food what the
fuck i don't even know if northern
norway has any food to eat i don't know
people eating ice or some shit like that
right
eating inactivity activity patterns of
our ancestors were incredibly varied
a lot of it was opportunism
humans would eat whatever the fuck was
around that means they would scavenge
they would pick berries they would eat
mushrooms they would try to eat
ancestral grains which largely sucked
and are difficult to digest that's why
modern grains were genetically
engineered to be better
they would eat everything they could get
their fucking hands on kind of like the
seagull diet or the squirrel diet
anything that's around that's going in
because mostly humans were starving to
death for large fractions of our
evolutionary history it was not a fun
time
and it was not
people in balance with their environment
eating
raw red meat and taking contrast baths
or whatever the
fuck primal stupid shit like that we're
supposed to be doing
in the end there's one big ass fact
about real life it's that modernity
is a good thing
that's why every single primal coach
you'll ever interact with that tells you
we need to live like our ancestors do a
couple things in common they all go to
the hospital
when they get sick like i've said this
about a trillion times but if you break
your leg we don't push you next to the
avatar tree and be like all right nature
do its thing
because you just lay there like ah
like why isn't the tree healing him
because that fucking how it works
you get hurt you go to the hospital you
get sick you go to the hospital what
does the hospital have big pharma
medicines
evil corporate doctors and machines upon
machines upon machines that actually
heal you that's all modern that's not
primal that's a good thing you want to
go to the hospital if you get fucked up
all of these primal coaches
use social media
social media is a technological device
okay because every time you use your
iphone to scroll social media all that
shit you see lives in a server farm in
iowa it takes like a trillion kilojoules
of air conditioning and heating to
maintain the exact temperature that they
need to maintain it all the time primary
conditioning and less heating because
the servers make their own heat i knew
someone was gonna put that in the
fucking comments
that is not primal there is no facebook
or instagram or auto zoom cameras so you
can talk into the camera and sell your
primal programs in the fucking primal
times it does not exist
and they all shop at the fucking
supermarket
which again is not primal and i know it
sounds crazy but some of them even take
steroids
i wonder who i'm talking about it
wouldn't be liver king
it would be liver king
anyway probabilistically that's where my
money's at
unless you're just a shade of red for no
reason
maybe
here's the thing
the primal people have some fucking good
points but the good points can be
summarized with excising the primal
bullshit altogether and just saying the
following
do healthy shit
which means what
be more active
train harder and train more consistently
eat plenty of any and all of the
following food groups
lean proteins
veggies fruits grains healthy fats
be truer to yourself into what you want
and don't engage in toxic habits that
are ruining your life don't watch as
much tv as you maybe are now or maybe
watch more if that's what makes you
happy do healthy shit that makes sense
have a good sleep schedule all that
stuff is great it doesn't require us to
be primal you just require us to do
obvious shit that we already know we're
fucking supposed to be doing like you
don't watch netflix till four in the
morning and you're like yeah man
modernity's great fuck being primo i
love netflix like yeah but your sleep's
fucked up and you know that shit most
the time you know what's healthy and
what's not it doesn't have dick to do
with primal or not it's just good shit
like eating well and taking care of
yourself and waking up at a reasonable
hour doing your work surrounding
yourself with happy people
and fucking going hard in the gym that's
about just about it
that's just about it folks that's not
primal it's just a good idea
cause primal as arnold said it best is
bullshit

get in that algorithm
because one of the best things about
modernity it is designed
as a lamborghini
and my butlers are honestly getting
tired of not having any more new
lamborghinis they're asking for a new
lamborghini just about every day now
annoying but i can't push back hard
against them for two reasons
one
is there's kind of a lot of butlers now
i mean i'm like a trillionaire or
something there's like 20 i don't even
know all the butlers by name some of
them by face
so when they say hey doctor might get us
more lamborghini so we can drive them
and take care of them for you i'm like
all right fellas uh frank and they're
like it's bob i'm like i'm sorry i'll go
talk to hr
the second thing is that
it's not technically a union but the
butlers have their own cooperative and
they're sort of making demands and i
honestly don't really feel safe all the
time but their only demands are for more
lamborghinis please buy shit from rp
so that i can stay safe to make more
videos
did you guys hear that i think the
butlers are coming see you guys next
time
you
