hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization
strength training myths video number six
every workout must be heavy to make you
strong
we're going to talk about the claim
we're going to talk about why it's got
an element of truth and you can't
actually replace
heavy training and still expect to be
strong or definitely your strongest
but we're going to talk about non-heavy
ways of training that can actually make
you stronger when combined with heavy
training
and we're gonna synthesize that finally
into one last
major holistic approach here we go
what is the claim exactly how does it
really come off well
people say things like when you when
you're training for strength you gotta
go heavy
they also say light work doesn't make
you strong like that's bitch wait put
some fucking weight on the bar shit like
that
and essentially if you do any stuff that
doesn't fit the mold of like three to
six reps or
one to three reps and hard people will
say like
it's just fluff work what the hell are
you doing you're wasting your time
and you won't get strong this way and at
the very least some of these people
if not confrontational will just be
inquisitive like
why are you doing sets of 10 i thought
you were a power lifter and
some of you guys have probably heard
that before and of course you want to
roll your eyes completely around in your
head
but those folks do have a little bit of
a point and here it is you can't replace
heavy
because here's the reality first of all
for you to get as strong as you possibly
can basic strength training sets of
roughly three to six repetitions
that challenge you with rpe 7 or above
have to be the core of your strength
training now if they're not the core of
your training
something else is the course that's a
five to ten sets of three to six with
lightweight but really fast
anything else you can get stronger for
sure
but you can't do your best at getting
the strongest so if you want to be the
strongest you can be
most of your training has to be hard
heavy sets of three to six reps
period if you for some reason don't like
this range
i personally don't like it a whole lot i
used to be a power lifter i loved it
back then then i sort of
just went a different way and i realized
i liked sort of like higher reps and
pump work
more okay just marginally more i still
love training for strength but i like
training for hypertrophy a little bit
more
if you don't like training in that three
to six range you're trying to do things
to avoid it
strength training will be extra tough
because no amount of pump work
or speed work can make you just gnarly
strong
right in other words if you're trying to
find
a way to get your strongest possible
without that
low rep grind like if you do a set of
four
hard oh that last one barely comes up if
you're like man
i hate this that's a three and four shit
my elbows hurt my shoulders i
i don't get a pump i uh just oh it's
awful it
feels heavy in my hands i don't like it
if that's you
don't bother looking for alternatives
because you won't be your strongest
typically the people that get the
strongest from training
are ones that love that shit there's
some people that can barely get away
from it
they do a set of eight and they're like
ah it feels like cardio they do
speed work and they're like oh i feel
like i'm not training they do a grinder
set of five and they're like their eyes
light up they love it
at the end of the day that's a really
good thing because that's what really is
the core of making you the strongest you
can be so that's the plus sides and why
people are sometimes tempted to say like
you got to go fucking heavy and if
you're not then you're not doing
anything for strength it's just an
illusion
well there are other ways
of training that can complement strength
and some of them complement strength to
an incredibly effective degree
so that if you think only super heavy
work is strength training it turns out
that's not true
the core of your training should be
heavy but it's not everything
there are at least two other things you
can be doing no
should be doing if you're going to get
your best possible results
from strength the first is hypertrophy
work
in the six to ten and we can even push
it six to twelve for small muscle group
isolations
six to twelve rep range can build a ton
of
size while costing you much less fatigue
than if you tried to build that same
amount of size with sets of three to six
when you have that size first of all
bigger muscles are directly usually
stronger
and even if not directly stronger
because the nervous system hasn't been
trained super heavy in a while while
you've been training for higher reps
when you take that new muscle you grew
from higher up training
you can teach it through nervous system
and fiber alignment with
sets of three to six for several weeks
or months to be the strongest
it's ever been big muscles are stronger
muscles if not in the short term
definitely in the long term which is why
everyone who's ever benched over 700
is fucking enormous there's not a single
person that's benched over 700 which is
to say there's like five people total
that have done that
that doesn't have a ridiculously
enormous chest and arms they just don't
exist same thing for people that have
deadlifted over a thousand
squatted over 900 you can't leverage and
wire your way into insane lifts
predictably and if you can in one lift
it's because of leverages
guys that are amazing deadlifters that
don't look super jacked
usually dog shit bench pressers because
their fucking arms are too goddamn long
they could be good bench pressers too
if they weighed 50 pounds more and they
had bigger chest and arms size is
king for strength and if you train for
size especially with that 6 to 12 rep
range
that really puts on a ton of size but is
not so
different in training from the three to
six like yeah maybe you don't want to do
a sets of 15 to 20. that's for
bodybuilders that have
less functional muscles sets of 6 to 12
is amazing and you can train
months like that without going heavy and
then after a period of just several
weeks
maybe a month or two at most you make
the transition back to heavy training
and it's a wellspring of new strength
that you never literally never could
have realized
with smaller muscles right you're
basically making the car engine bigger
by expanding your muscle size so if
someone notices that you're training
for sets of 10 because you're in a
powerlifting hypertrophy phase and they
say
dutch you were powerlift dude worth
doubles and triples just kindly push
their
fucking face the fuck out of the fuck
out of my way nothing really
says go fuck yourself like a face push i
sure hope the youtube algorithm isn't
advanced enough to
notice i'm swearing excessively like
five minutes in this video anyway
so that's one way of training for
strength higher repetitions for
hypertrophy to
to support strength that's awesome and a
good idea and if you're not doing it
you're missing out secondly technique
only training
is training in the three to six rep
range but at like a five
rpe or lower okay we're talking about
much lighter weights like
so for example it could be something
like 50 to 65
uh often of your one rep max done for a
set of three to six which
it's super easy but it pays dividends
first it can improve your nervous
system's ability to exert force
and it can really let you improve your
technique because
there may be a situation where you
trained two times that week heavy
if you trained a third time heavy would
crush you for next week out of
it's not an option you could take a
complete day off of training let's say
squats again
but what if you train squats with this
recovery only or technique only kind of
training
three or four sets of three to six reps
at 50 percent of your 1rm what's going
to happen is your technique is going to
improve
your nervous system's ability to fire
rapidly is going to improve and that
directly can make you
stronger period but it does so at a tiny
fatigue cost sometimes
actually a negative fatigue because it
can help you recover by moving you
around
more what ends up happening is if
someone comes into the gym
and says dude like what fucking percent
of your max
even is that like you really think it's
gonna get you strong if you're fucking
lifting pussy waves
uh they have a point if you train like
that all the time but if you
do mostly heavy training and supplement
it with
some of this technique only training not
only can it help you sometimes recover
even better than if you did nothing
but it actually does in that context of
heavy training make you a little bit
stronger
than you otherwise would have been and
the really awesome thing about it
is if you're still super beat up and you
can't go heavy again
you can still go light and see the
benefits so you maybe don't have to take
as many days off you think and
sit at home and be like damn i wish i
was recovered enough to train three
times a week
fuck i can only squat two times a week
oh no you may be able to squat three
times a week
just not all of them can be super heavy
but because we already know we just
learned
sets of three to six various of
maximally can be beneficial you can
still go in and benefit yeah
egotistically it's not fucking great
because you're there like making sure
the hot girl who of course keeps track
of
everyone's uh one rep max is in her head
not you know you don't want to be seen
with 200 pounds on the bars like
you know people walk by and you're
squatting 200 for sets of five and
you're like
i'm a 400 pound squatter they're like
what like i just wanted to know that so
you didn't judge me they're like i don't
even fucking know why you're talking to
me right like
people are paranoid about lifting light
weight because they're thinking they'll
judge they're probably judging
themselves if you can put that shit
aside and realize you're a performance
athlete
you can absolutely do lighter weights
when you're not recovered you have your
ones
low reps high speed excellent technique
makes you better periods if you want to
get better occasionally lifting light is
a very good idea
now taking all that together what is the
best total approach
first most of your weekly sessions and
on average sessions through the year if
you're looking at block periodization
should be hard and heavy in that three
to six rep range i mean fucking training
for strength
you're training for strength okay and if
you're most of your training doesn't
look like that at the very least over
the year
you're not really training for strength
you just tell people you're training for
strength mostly
you do sets of 15 to 20 and you see your
strength athlete
but it's unlikely right so most of your
training should be heavy
but when adding size is your goal
you can spend months in the 6 to 12 rep
range no problem
maybe not actually increase your
strength during that time especially if
you're advanced
because as your muscles are getting
bigger the nervous system qualities
and the architectural quality of your
muscle are declining because you're not
training it heavy anymore
but after you ease back in
possibly you just get stronger the whole
time but even if you're not and gave
roughly the same strength maybe lose a
little strength during that time
which can be a total mind fuck we'll
address that in other videos
after that phase of hypertrophy if
you're successful and you eat enough
food etc
your muscles are so much bigger now we
apply the system of training
with mostly heavy sets of 36 reps you're
gonna get the strongest you've ever been
right and lastly if you can only truly
go hard and heavy
x number of times a week you can
probably fit in
some uh tech only work or technique only
training
remember sets of three to six but super
light roughly fifty percent of one or
max or something like that
you can fit that in you know
mathematically x plus n number of times
a week so maybe if you can train
hard twice a week in the squat maybe a
third workout can be done
easy technique only and that will make
you absolutely stronger in the long term
it'll even make you stronger in the
short term because it's really going to
quickly refine your technique
technique is something that you can
train way more than strength or
hypertrophy
and it really responds to high
frequencies and can quickly quickly
improve
right in addition to that this
utilization
of these technique only sessions can
really
lead to a significant reduction in
injury risk
because you're not ever tempted to push
your body when it's not ready
if you only have like one gun in your
holster
and that gun is heavy training three to
six
you may be tempted to be like yeah i can
only recover twice a week but
fuck that i'm gonna suck it up and go
three times a week and you get hurt
but you want to squat three times a week
because you know more is better to some
extent but you just can't survive it
there's always that temptation to just
do more but now that you have another
gun on the other holster
of lighter work that you know
supplements that and still makes you
stronger
but is safe as fuck because who the hell
is getting injured doing fifty percent
of our max for such a three six look
do you get hurt doing that shit you had
it coming okay this is gonna happen
anyway you could have just like
walked up a flight of stairs and pulled
your quad at that point so
if you have that as a gun you can pull
from another holster
then when you feel like you're like man
two two sessions a week is not enough i
want to do more you're like oh well i
can do more by trying a technique only
session and look if you can recover
enough to do three hard sessions yeah
for sure do it
but if you can't you don't have to have
the choice of either i do two sessions
and i stay home the rest of the time
which is frustrating
now you have the choice of well i can do
two hard sessions
and then i can still show up to the gym
maybe do a hard deadlift session or
something
and after that do some light technique
work in the squat it makes me better
overall
without this dogma of i always have to
go heavy so you can get over that
you can include hypertrophy work you can
include technique only work and it can
make you better overall
folks use this insight to get stronger
and when you get so strong that you can
fight all the world's militaries and win
remember the little guy mostly me see
you next time
