Hey, what's up guys?
Sean Nalewanyj here of seannal.com, bodytransformationtruth.com
with a very simple quick video today regarding
proper shoulder warm-ups, I see people doing
this pretty much every time I go into the
gym, where they just stand there with a pair
of dumbbells and do this motion.
And the reason people are doing that is because
they’re trying to warm-up their rotator
cuff.
But if you’re standing with a pair of dumbbells,
then that means that the resistance is pulling
straight down.
If the resistance is pulling straight down,
then what you’re actually doing is it’s
basically like an isometric hold for your
biceps and your forearms.
If you actually want to hit your rotator cuff,
the resistance has to be pulling from this
way, not straight up and down.
So, there are two really basic ways that you
can do this.
If you want to use a dumbbell, then you can
just lay across a flat bench like you see
here or you can even do it from the floor.
And just perform your external rotations that
way or the way that I prefer to do it is using
a cable like you see here with your elbow
at waist tight and just performing your external
rotations that way.
I do think warming up your shoulders prior
to training is a good idea.
And including some external rotation work
for your rotator cuffs is an important part
of a complete shoulder warm-up.
So, that’s all for today guys, just a very
quick tip.
Hope you found this helpful.
And I’ll talk to you again soon.
