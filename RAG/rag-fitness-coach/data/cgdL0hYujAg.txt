maybe just use this form as an example
of what not to do
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and it's time i held off for a while on
this one but
enough of you guys requested it and he
posted a video last week that i thought
was worthy of critiquing
so it has to be done let's talk about
the one
the only tyrone the fitness addict yeah
i said it
and specifically i'm going to break down
his recent video four triceps exercises
for mass
you should be doing now before i jump
into it i got to be honest here okay
i don't actually dislike this guy just
to let y'all know
i don't have any genuine animosity
toward him all right yeah he puts out
some inaccurate fitness information
and some pretty cringy pickup videos as
well
hey what's up hi i'm nice to meet you
too my name is tyrone what's your name
nice name so so i was running away from
toronto brampton away from
toronto nice nice but i really don't
believe he's thinking these videos
through on
some sort of deep philosophical level or
consciously trying to mislead anybody in
any sort of malicious way okay i think
tyrone is just a simple dude trying to
put out some content and sell some hats
and t-shirts
but that he just doesn't happen to be
the most knowledgeable or the
sharpest guy around i would be in the
club slipping on some hennessy with my
shirt sweating [ __ ] your persona
doesn't shout intellectual
i'm gonna put five
full eggs in the in my shake why
why that's one that's two
i have to get my protein man four
five what the hell so we're gonna take
strawberries
okay strawberries
you throw a couple strawberries you
don't know what the hell you're talking
about
so don't take this too seriously don't
go to his channel and leave a bunch of
hate okay this is mainly just for fun
and i'm also going to make this video
educational as well and go through
tyrone's triceps workout to give you
some legitimate tips that you can apply
in the gym as well
and if you enjoy these commentary style
videos then please just do me one small
favor
and hit that like button below it really
helps to boost the video up
and it lets me know that you guys want
to see more of this type of content
so go ahead and press that like button
and let's get started what's popping
youtube it's your boy tom brown
today guys i'm going to show you a crazy
intense arm workout
stay tuned for this video and i hope you
guys like it
why are you yelling at me the first
exercise on the list are dips
now this is totally fine as a main
triceps exercise it's a solid compound
movement so nothing at all wrong with
that
however if you really want to focus in
on the triceps during dips then ideally
you want your body to be a bit more
upright
you can see here that t-dog is more so
leaning forward
and that's going to shift more emphasis
onto the chest and turn it into more of
a horizontal press
now this is not a huge deal either way
you're still going to hit the triceps
hard using either variation
but if fully maximizing tension on the
triceps is your goal then try to stay a
bit more upright
the only truly bizarre element of
tyron's form here
is this mysterious bicycle kicking
motion that he's doing with his legs i
don't have a clue what's going on there
i tried to come up with some sort of
reason for why he might be doing that
but then i realized that that's probably
pointless trying to figure out his
precise reasoning for things
given that he also uploaded a chest
workout where he punches himself in the
stomach after each set of push-ups
push up get up
one one two
one two three
what the [ __ ] is he doing check my
triceps out guys it's popping out
and you know for a fact god damn
anyways results don't lie check it out
actually the truth is that when it comes
to building muscle
results really can lie uh it might seem
contradictory especially to people who
are new to fitness
but just keep in mind that just because
someone has a good physique
you know has an impressive lean muscular
body that doesn't necessarily mean
that they truly understand what they're
doing in the gym in reality
anybody with good genetics who trains
hard is consistent
and has a decent diet in place they're
still going to get very good results
regardless of the specifics
and in tyrone's case you can see just
based on looking at him
you know the muscle shape the insertions
the overall structure he definitely does
have
well above average bodybuilding genetics
but even though someone looks good
it's still perfectly possible that
they're doing a bunch of sub-optimal
things in their program
and that they're getting results in
spite of a lot of the incorrect things
they do
and not specifically because of those
things and so it doesn't automatically
mean
that they're a good coach or that you
should follow their advice or that what
they're doing is going to work well for
people with average genetics
i'm not saying that someone's physique
is not a factor at all you know i like
to see people lead by example
just as much as anybody but keep in mind
that it's just one piece of the pie
and it definitely should not be the only
thing that you're taking into
consideration
anyway next up he does triceps kickbacks
kickbacks is definitely going to help
you guys also
to build huge triceps
now ultimately any exercise that loads
the triceps through elbow extension
is going to stimulate them for growth
but i would say that out of all the
options available
i would put dumbbell triceps kickbacks
specifically
toward the bottom of the list because
they just have an awkward resistance
curve
they're really easy in the bottom
position and there's very little tension
on the triceps
because gravity is pulling the weight
straight down and then as you extend up
past halfway and into the top position
it suddenly becomes a lot harder so
they're just kind of awkward to perform
i'm not saying you can't do them but at
the very least i wouldn't use
dumbbell kickbacks as a primary triceps
exercise
if you are going to do kickbacks then
it's better to do them using a cable
because that's going to give you more
consistent tension throughout the full
range of motion
i don't think the whole constant tension
thing is actually that important
as long as you get close to failure by
the end of the set but i do think that
if you try the cable kickback variation
you're gonna find that it feels a lot
more natural and it's a lot smoother to
perform
and also one other way to train the
triceps with the shoulder in that
extended position
so with the upper arm behind your body
which is the one
sort of unique aspect of the triceps
kickback another option for that is the
exercise you see here
which i guess you could call a cable
press back this is another way to
accomplish the same thing
and again i just find that this feels a
lot smoother and more natural
in comparison to a regular bent over
free weight kickback
and the way tyrone performs his
kickbacks is especially bad
because he's not taking into account how
the force of gravity affects the
resistance on the triceps and i'm not
singling him out because
a lot of people actually make the same
mistake so the issue here is that since
the force of gravity is pulling the
weight straight down
once your forearm is perpendicular to
the floor there's actually no resistance
on the triceps whatsoever
the triceps only start working once your
forearm is angled back
past perpendicular so bringing your
forearm even further forward really has
no purpose at all
i'm not saying it's going to kill you if
the weight drifts forward slightly and
tension leaves the triceps momentarily
but
the way tyrone does this is just
especially bad
because he doesn't just go beyond
perpendicular but he actually brings the
dumbbell all the way forward and flexes
at the elbow which technically turns
this
into like half biceps curl half triceps
extension
he also says not to swing the weight and
i totally agree with that
but it looks to me like swinging the
weight is exactly what he's doing here
so maybe just use this form as an
example of what not to do
and concentrate on
your triceps okay don't just swing the
weight
make sure you contract the muscle um a
small bit of momentum is fine
you don't need to lift like a complete
robot but you should be in control of
the weight at all times
and i also recommend doing a slightly
slower negative so that you're actively
resisting the weight on the way down
rather than just letting gravity do all
the work when i do my workout
after every set i try to squeeze my
triceps
that's what you see me doing right now i
squeeze and make sure i get
as much as blood in my triceps as
possible
so this really isn't something you need
to worry about uh just aimlessly trying
to flex and
shove more blood into the muscle in
between sets um that's not going to
improve your gains
if anything i would think that that
would be counterproductive because it's
just going to interfere with your
recovery in between sets
for maximum muscle growth you want to be
taking full proper rest periods in
between each set
so that you can fully recover and
generate maximum performance each time
that's what building muscle is
ultimately about it's about
improving your lifting performance over
time not trying to see
how huge of a pump you can get and then
now we're going straight to singles
okay same thing four sets 12 reps
so i think including an overhead
extension of some kind in your triceps
training is a good idea
because it will really maximize stress
on the long head which is the largest of
the three triceps heads and it can
sometimes end up
being slightly under trained if you
don't do any extension type movements
with your shoulder in that flex position
so the exercise selection here is fine
now if you have
good shoulder flexibility and you're
using lighter weight then the form that
tyrone is using might be okay for you
but generally speaking you're going to
be better off to not flare your elbow
completely out to the side like this
because that can put unnecessary stress
on your shoulder joint
you don't want your elbows to be
completely tucked in and pinned against
your head either
jerry i really think it'd be easier if
you didn't cook excuse me
fine you don't want me to tuck put me
down for a no time
i'd say about halfway between tucked and
flared
that's a good middle ground to hit your
triceps effectively and minimize
shoulder stress at the same time
alrighty so that's one tuck and one no
tuck
and as always tyrone recommends doing
four sets of 12
for each workout uh obviously he means
four sets of 12
for each exercise not for each workout
so make sure you guys do
four sets of 12 reps of each workout
do four sets of 12 reps of each workout
and remember to flex at the end of each
workout
the last work on the list is skull
crushers
you keep using the horde i don't think
it means what you think it means
so as he says the last workout on the
list are skull crushers now this is fine
skull crushers are a good triceps
exercise as long as you don't go too
heavy on them and you do them under
control
tyrone's form looks fine here the only
thing i'd recommend
again is slowing down that negative
slightly you don't have to do super slow
negatives
but i do think that you should lower the
weight under control and actively resist
on the way down not just for the sake of
putting more tension on the muscle
but it's also going to reduce the stress
on your joints as well
if you get sloppy with your skull
crusher's form that's a really great way
to snap your elbows up
and tyron actually does one thing that i
like here which is that he incorporates
a bit of shoulder extension into the
movement so you can see that
his shoulders rock slightly back and
forth on each rep this actually reduces
the stress on the elbows
and since the long head of the triceps
crosses the shoulder joint
and actually assists with shoulder
extension you're not going to be harming
your triceps gains by doing this either
if anything you might actually improve
them
so all in all it's not like his exercise
selection
or form for this triceps workout was
horrendous it wasn't great it could
still use some improvements like i
mentioned
however the real issue here beyond the
exercises and the form
is the simple fact that he's doing a
dedicated triceps workout in the first
place now tyrone's
obviously been lifting for many years
he's already built most of the muscle
that he's genetically capable of so for
him it really doesn't matter
but if you haven't built up like 80 to
90 percent plus of your genetic
potential
and you want to see gains at the fastest
rate then you definitely shouldn't be
doing an entire workout dedicated just
to your triceps
you don't even need an entire workout
dedicated to your arms in general and
you definitely don't need to be doing
16 sets for your triceps in one session
either and as a side note you probably
shouldn't be doing it drunk at four in
the morning either
what's popping youtube it's a boy tom
brown and i'm back from the club it's 4
a.m
and i had to drag the camera man with me
because i'm gonna do a
tricep workout for you guys and guys i'm
kind of
[Music]
big triceps anyways
like i said i'm tipsy a bit but that's
not an excuse
are you actually saying these words as
i've said before
bro split style workouts are still
effective if you train hard and you
progressively overload over time
any training split can technically work
but unless you're an advanced lifter if
you want to make gains at the fastest
possible rate
forget these single body part focused
workouts and go with a routine where
you're hitting more muscles per session
with slightly reduced volume per muscle
but then hitting those muscles more
frequently throughout the week
not once per week like with a bro split
but more like
i would say one and a half to two times
per week that will be the most effective
way to build up your overall size and
strength
full body three days a week or upper
lower three to four days per week
it's pretty much impossible to go wrong
with that as a novice lifter and if
you've got a bit more experience
then legs push pull done i would say
four to five days per week that's a
great approach as well
