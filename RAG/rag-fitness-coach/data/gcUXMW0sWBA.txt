[Music]
hey folks dr michael is here for lecture
two
in the nutritional approaches to muscle
gain
calories and macros
for muscle gain specifically what do we
have on the docket today oh my outlook
settings
are out of date my computer says
pointlessly as always
i wonder how many people still use
outlook and if that person is lonely
ever
contents coming up for this presentation
first
why calories matter so before we're
going to get into telling you what kind
of calories to eat to gain muscle we
have to explain why calories matter
because they really do and a lot of that
why they matter
opens up in as to how they matter and
how we should eat
after that we'll look at how to choose
your calorie levels potentially from
tables right because a lot of times
people like how many calories should i
eat and they'll look it up in a table
we'll talk about them sort of
which tables you can look at pluses and
minuses so on and so forth
we're going to talk about next choosing
calorie levels from equations there's a
variety of equations where you plug in
your activity level your body weight so
on and so forth
and they give you a calories to eat to
gain weight we'll talk about their
upsides downside so on and so forth
after that we're going to talk about how
body weight measurements taken over the
long terms of time as you gain weight in
a hypercaloric diet
can make the calorie levels from tables
and equations a bit smaller of an issue
than we seem to think because a lot of
people come
to the muscle gain uh you know sort of
approach and say i want to gain muscle i
want to eat enough
where are the best tables and the best
equations for me to start
we're going to see how monitoring and
tracking of weight really makes that
first question much more moot point than
people think so it's good to get a good
start but you don't need the perfect
start
all right after that we're going to talk
about why protein matters and how much
protein to take in why carbs matter how
much carbs to take in why fats matter
how much fat to take in and that is
what's on the agenda today so
first and foremost why do calories
matter
why do we need to eat a hypercaloric
diet in order to
actually maximize our chances of gaining
the most muscle that we can well
number one probably the most obvious one
excess calories are
literally the raw materials for muscle
growth
okay if you don't have an excess where
is the growth coming from
let's say you have a skyscraper or
analogy for muscle growth
and you want a bigger skyscraper
if we don't give any new
raw materials to build no bricks no
steel no glass
over and above what it takes to just fix
the brakes and
replace the pipes that are leaky how are
we supposed to get a bigger skyscraper
it's
literally impossible to put this in more
real terms realistic terms
you can't be 180 pounds big if you weigh
160 pounds
there's just no way so people will say
uh and if this is
questions i've been asked maybe
thousands of times like hey i want to
get huge what should i eat
and i say when i was a high protein
hyper caloric diet
i said well yeah yeah hypochlorous i
want to gain weight i just want to get
bigger
right like oh okay why don't you want to
gain weight well i don't want to get fat
like so can i just get bigger but
stay the same weight all right are you
filling yourself up with
air no they're like well i can lose some
fat well how much fat can you lose
let's say you're 160 pounds of 15 fat
well potentially you could sort of gain
after a long long time 160 pounds and 10
percent fat
but are you really going to be 160
pounds and 5 fat but never gaining
weight to begin with
sure let's even grant you that what if
someone stands next to you and they're
180 pounds and five percent fat how
they're gonna make you look
there's no more fat to lose at 160
pounds it's gonna make you any bigger
right you're still 160 right there's no
mr olympia
contest on earth in which the guy who
wins is 130 pounds and he just happens
to sort of look bigger than the guy
who who loses who's you know 290 pounds
it just doesn't work like that
so if you want more physical muscle
you got to gain weight right and the way
to do that is a hypercaloric diet
right next the hypercaloric condition
right your cells are very good at
sensing their energy balance
and when they get more energy more
calories than they need various
intracellular pathways for muscle growth
activate or become easier to turn on and
turn up
one of the examples here is mtor uh the
mammalian target of rapamycin
it's a really central governor for
hypertrophy it doesn't count for all
growth but a lot of it
and if you introduce a hypercaloric
condition to the muscle cell
mtor turns up it becomes more permissive
in its activity
so once you train it really skyrockets
versus if you train under hypocaloric
condition
you know it goes up but not nearly as
much so hypercolor condition literally
switches on muscle cell
uh growth pathways really important
the corollary of that is also as true
the hypochlor condition not enough
calories
causes intracellular muscle loss
pathways to
activate for example ampk right
ampk adenosine monophosphate kinase
pathway
is a central regulator that kind of is
the opposite of mtor
what it does is it turns on aerobic
adaptations it makes your fibers more
slow twitch in nature
and it causes muscle uh not atrophy but
catabolism like a
reduction in muscle size to make the
muscle more endurant it causes endurance
adaptations
if you are hypocaloric ampk is more
often on and is more often turned up
higher
geez that's really kind of bad right so
even if you're eating enough protein
you're training weights hard if you're
hypocaloric
you're shooting yourself in the foot as
far as your best chances for muscle gain
right after this point number four
hormones and other regulators follow
calories
testosterone goes up in a hypercaloric
diet
goes down in a hypocaloric diet can you
gain an isocaloric diet
yeah but not as much as you could in a
hyper and
cortisol as soon as you drop your
calories cortisol has a higher chance of
being elevated cortisol so stress
hormone cortisol does not cause muscle
gain
and it actually causes muscle loss if
you're hyper caloric your cortisol
levels
any other environmental conditions being
equal get turned down
so let's go through the checklist real
quick extra calories hypercaloric diet
literally provide your raw materials for
growth which beyond a certain point is
impossible
without those raw material they
intracellularly turn on
growth pathways they intracellularly
turn down growth blocking pathways
and they turn up hormones uh that grow
muscle
in the bloodstream and they turn down
hormones that prevent muscle gain i mean
good god calories matter
right and a lot of folks kind of know
that the excess calories thing
works but they say we know i'm 200
pounds and i sort of have a lot of body
fat and
i don't ever want to be bigger than 200
pounds so i'm just going to like train
and diet and and just sort of stay the
same weight build muscle and lose fat
well
you're getting one of those benefits uh
taken away but you're also getting all
all the other benefits taken away right
yeah
like the you know excess calories are
not necessary because they can come from
body fat if you're really high fat
but then the other three things are just
not around and those are three very
powerful things
so potentially if you started 200 pounds
and i'm pretty high body fat what you
can do is you can lose some fat
gain some weight lose some fat gain some
weight you still get the recomposition
effect of
you know over time lower body fat but
you also get the effect of a much faster
rate of muscle
versus if you just stayed iso caloric
the whole time and never expose yourself
to these powerful weapons why does it
work that
because muscle that's been put on
already is much easier to keep on
than new muscle is to put on so when we
put on muscle we want to have
really really good effort all of these
checklist items hopefully are checked
and then when we keep muscle in a
hypocaloric diet it's not terribly hard
real real big difference there so
calories matter quite a bit
right now next up we want to choose our
calorie values
in order to start a diet okay calories
are important got it so
the rule is we have to have enough
calories to per muscle growth which
means enough calories to gain weight
but how many calories is that well
there's lots of tables you can look up
online
that are basically tell you how many
calories to eat in order to gain weight
now here's the deal
one of these tables is right in front of
you on this slide as i'm speaking and
it's the table from the rp diet book um
i believe this is a rp diet book 2.0
table the most updated one
so uh you know there's a variations on a
theme the best tables
so the tables all have to take at least
one thing into account which is body
weight okay
the best tables take into account your
training volume or how much physical
activity you're doing as well and it
doesn't have to be really big gradations
but like light moderate and hard
training cause a different level
of caloric expenditure all right and
thus you need to eat more food if you're
training super hard than if you're
bailey training at all right you burn
more calories doing that
and thus you need more calories and
orders still stay hyper caloric so
what you can do is look at this table
that's given as an example
and or you can look up the renaissance
diet book 2.0 it has this table in it
and
a ton more explanation and you would
just add you know 10
calories to this table because this
table is isocalora great it's for
maintenance
so if i say 150 pounds and i'm training
moderate training on average
um 2435 calories per day is what it says
10 to that so you know roughly like oh i
don't know 2600 calories 2 700
that's probably gonna probably gonna be
a good place to
start possibly expecting gains
i'm making a lot of uh
sort of conditions to those statements
for a very good reason we'll talk about
in just a bit so table
pretty decent place to start make sure
you have one that takes physical
activity into account
next up what about choosing calorie
levels from equations you want an
equation to plug in
the harris benedict equations probably
one of the better ones
it's been revised as recently as 1990
that's the one that we display here
you get a result by plugging in your
weight in kilograms
your height in centimeters and your age
in years because that
seems to factor into basal metabolic
rate there's a correction factor there
one for males one for females equations
a little bit different
so that's a good place to start but
here's benedict equation we've got to be
careful about because it just gives you
basal metabolic rates right that's the
very bare minimum
that your body needs to survive so what
about integrating activity into that on
top of that well
there's a correction factor that you can
type into these equations
and uh here's the next slide there so
it's lifestyle sedentary or light
activity active
or moderately active and vigorously
active there's examples of what that is
for regular lifestyle and of course you
would integrate chaining into that and
as you can see
you multiply your bmr by a certain
amount so the harris benedict equation
you plug in all your body weight and
stuff like that your age
and what it does is it poops out what's
your basal metabolic rate maybe like 2
000 calories a day
then if your sedentary lead activity you
multiply that by 1.53
and you get how much you're supposed to
be eating to maintain your weight
and then of course you'd add 10 percent
to that um
and you're off to possibly a hyper
caloric condition or a pretty good
estimate at a good start
and you're rolling right so all's fair
pretty good
but what about something simpler right
is there a simpler way to go about it
well there actually is
you can take your body weight in pounds
and you can multiply it by roughly 12 to
15.
that's it 12 if your activities are
relatively lower if you have a slower
metabolism so on and so forth
maybe you're not training a ton and 15
if you're training a bunch
fast metabolism really high work effort
you're really physically active so on
and so forth
and it gets you into the ballpark of a
general sort of beginning to gain muscle
kind of thing
all right all right so far so good
so those are all fine ways to measure
and estimate
or sorry find ways to estimate
what your calorie needs are for muscle
gain
but they have some limits and there's
other ways to do it too you could go
online and there's various
calculators where they do all the hair
spandex stuff for you you sort of just
plug in the variables and they
poop out a calorie level that you want
it's definitely a thing and it's a fine
place to start
but this slide is called how bodyweight
measurements make the above
a small issue estimating from
tables estimating from equations might
be a smaller issue than it seems
why here's the deal number one
no matter how good the table or equation
is your individual values can be
off by a lot like a lot a lot
like 500 to 1000 calories a lot
so if you're looking for the perfect
equation to take everything
into account you're not
estimating in a very very intelligent
way you're not spending your time in an
intelligent way
so if you spend two hours looking for
the perfect equation you could have
spent 15 minutes and found a decent
equation
and it got you into the ballpark anyway
even the best equations get you nothing
short
or nothing more than the ballpark right
you can be off by quite a lot
so how do you know how far off you are
right you've got an equation that says
2500 calories to gain muscle and you're
like okay well
how do i know if it's right or not i
don't want to be wrong for a long time
which is why flying blind is a bad idea
so
the true test of if you're hypercaloric
or not is
right we're going to come back to the
definition of hypercalor
hypercaloric means more calories than
you need to maintain your body weight
so by definition if you're hypercaloric
what's going to happen to your body
weight well over the long term it will
go
up so the real true test of whether
you're hypoglorically or not
is are you gaining are you
gaining body weight over time because
you can tell yourself everything you
want but if two months later whatever
super magical formula you used your
graph or equation
if you haven't gained any weight it
didn't work if you lost weight it really
didn't work
right and if you gained like you know 15
pounds and
you know a week and a half it's clearly
way overestimating and you're getting
way too fast you're gonna gain way too
much fat
so the true test is are you gaining it
are you getting at the appropriate rate
right so in this sense body weight
tracking measuring your body weight
multiple times a week
keeping averages becomes the gold
standard for making sure your calories
are high enough
right equations and tables are only ever
the start of your diet plan
they're totally fine to use you can use
the rp
tables you can use hair expanded
equation with correction factors
it doesn't much matter you just got to
get in the ballpark what do we mean by
that
if your true calories like it's
magically derived or if through body
weight tracking we later find
that you really need 3 300 calories to
gain weight at the appropriate pace
if you get anywhere between 2500
and 4000 on a first guess from a table
which you can totally do
you're golden because that very first
week or second week
third week that you're keeping track of
your body weights if you
said you started at 2 500 but it's
really 3 300
you're going to notice that you're
actually losing a little bit of weight
you're like oh boy then you're going to
up your calories
and you're going to up them again and
then you're going to be on the right
track it's only a couple weeks time
you don't lose months you don't even
lose weeks you're still training hard
you're still putting a lot of
hypertrophy into motion ideally you
would start gaining right away but
it's really not that far off and a lot
of times just two weeks in you can
really a really good feel for it
if it's 4 000 calories and you're
getting way too fast you can easily
within like a week or two
just cut that food level down a little
bit and start getting at the appropriate
pace
the thing is if there was a magical way
or a very advanced high-tech way for you
to match your calorie consumption
or sort of match your first week's
intake exactly to your perfect needs
would i be against it absolutely not
it's wonderful it would be really really
cool
problem is that method doesn't exist so
don't go looking for it
right in other words the reason i'm
getting a little bit uh prosthetizing
here
is that i want to make sure you guys
don't spend a ton of time
looking for this ultimate magical what
do you think of harris benedict versus
table
it doesn't matter because all of them
have pretty wide margins
but all the margins are well within
where you can start so you plug it in
there it's not going to give you
anything crazy even the
12 to 15 correction factor for body
weight and pounds works just fine
right there's that how do we measure
how do we know what's fine how do we
know it's not we'll talk about that in
multiple lectures down the line and
adjusting your calories but here
just for a start you start with whatever
tables or
equations you picked you add ten percent
of them to make sure you're
hyper-caloric
and then you and then we're going to
wait until next lecture of
how to actually measure days in weeks
and what to do about it
all right but that's the start next up
why protein matters so we're saying okay
protein's a thing
it's important why does it matter well
first of all
protein literally composes the biggest
fraction of weight of dry muscle tissue
why do we say dry because when a muscle
is wet or if it's in in a human being
and properly hydrated
most of it's water right but the almost
the rest of it
is going to be protein there's tons and
tons of protein in a muscle
really the biggest fraction of protein
of muscle
after water is protein so you gotta if
someone tells you they're building a
skyscraper
and they're saying it's mostly made of
you know steel
or some kind of iron ore and you're like
okay so so
do we need um do we need to import that
steel to get it the
building managers look at you like of
course where the hell are we going to
get if we don't you know
actually buy it like all right i knew
that right so can you imagine eating a
low protein if
if you find out that protein is what
mostly composes muscle it just doesn't
make any sense right
and uh so you know in other words if
you're building
a story on a building or a skyscraper
protein is like
the structure it's the steel it's the
wood it's the ceramic etc
so if you are building a skyscraper it's
good to have calories or sort of workers
to show up to build a thing for you
but you got to have protein in order to
actually be the components you literally
use to assemble the building
really really important thing right
so let's say you eat a ton of calories
and you check that off the box
we mentioned this in the lecture before
this in the introduction
low protein levels are prohibitive to
muscle growth why well
here's the deal if you consume a very
low amount of protein your body has to
start getting real stingy with it
it's got to look at the protein you're
taking in and go okay
i've got a couple of things to do that i
need to do in order to survive
in order to stay healthy in order to
stay functional
and one of those is build skeletal
muscle tissue especially if you're
already pretty jacked like you've got
extra skeletal muscle that you're not
sort of using day-to-day life it's just
training related
then your body's going to take that into
account and
because your protein is so low it's
going to feed the structures and
functions
that are most essential to survival and
replication
first because that's how evolution works
so what's it going to do
it's going to feed your brain your brain
consumes plenty of protein because the
cells there are really fast turnover
rate
your heart your heart is a muscle it
needs protein as well
your visceral organs a lot of which turn
over real fast like the intestines turn
over like crazy
rate of protein turnover protein demand
is massive right your blood vessels
literally reconstruct
themselves all the time they need
protein your skin your hair
right that's all stuff that's super
super super important right you don't
see a bodybuilder
on a contest stage like with the skin
falling off but he's really jacked like
your body takes care of your skin and
hair before it takes care of your
muscles for sure
of your skeletal muscles your immune
system requires protein to construct all
of
various materials to keep you healthy
and well your muscle skeletal muscle is
like priority number five or something
right way down on the list so if you
consume
if you need 150 grams of protein to grow
optimal muscle
and you consume only 100 grams of
protein your body does that checklist it
might never actually get to supplying
almost any skeletal
uh almost any uh muscle sorry almost any
protein or amino acids to skeletal
muscle as a matter of fact with that
little protein
it'll probably start taking in addition
to using the protein for everything else
that you're eating the hundred grams
it might take another 25 grams away from
your skeletal muscle every day
and you'll get smaller and smaller
tomorrow over time right so
protein matters because skeletal muscle
is just not a super high priority
and we kind of know that it's not a
super high priority because you got a
weight train to actually get big and you
got to eat really well to actually get
bigger you need a lot of protein to get
big
if it was a priority to grow you could
grow just just being a normal person
right so for example um you know your
heart and your brain
how little protein do you have to eat
for those to suffer growth well like
like anorexia levels like
super like actually starving levels
anything above that you're good to go
your brain and heart is the first thing
to get fed right so we got to remember
that and think okay i
have to eat enough protein because
muscle growth is kind of like a luxury
item
i mean a really quick analogy if you
know you have someone who's good at
their budget your body's very good at
their budget if you have someone who's
good at the budget they manage a
household
you know if they have not so much money
like let's say
somebody let's see mom got laid off of
work and dad's the only one bringing
bringing home any money
well you know we're not going to buy the
fancy toilet paper anymore we're not
going to buy a big screen tv we're not
going to buy a cadillac
we're going to try to live within our
means which means getting food on the
table first
the kids have clothes and books to go to
school the heat is turned on and that's
basically about it
right and and if you know the economy
improves or mom
you know gets another job and a couple
months later she's making a ton of money
now we have extra money to buy luxury
items muscle is a luxury item
so you've got to feed it protein enough
of it to make sure you grow it otherwise
it just doesn't happen a whole lot
right
muscle protein is such a powerful
potentiator of growth that if those
you can even gain calories on a deficit
and gain calories
and maintenance if you have enough
protein coming in your training hard
enough and you're not super duper
advanced
because your fat stores will provide the
energy the calories
and your protein will provide enough uh
of the actual raw materials to get some
muscle growth it's never optimal
i wouldn't try this but it still happens
which is evidence of eye protein being
super super effective so with high
protein intakes intermediates can
actually gain
at maintenance like if you're not losing
uh fat
at the time you're not hypocaloric you
can gain a pretty decent amount of
muscle over a long term
and beginners can even gain a deficit
this happens all the time people start
training in the first year they gain
like 10 pounds of muscle and lose like
30 pounds of fat this huge
transformation story
how the hell did you both at the same
time well they had enough body fat that
it was a
you know and their their power of muscle
growth is so they ate enough protein of
course
but their muscle growth is so powerful
because they just started out right it's
very sensitive that
the muscle is basically fed by the
protein intake
and then the calories supplied to
building that muscle come from the fat
stores
fast stores reduce you get really cool
recomposition does that happen in
advanced individuals
almost certainly not certainly not to
any impressive extent
so don't bet on that but just
illustrating the point protein matters
quite a bit
right all right now choosing protein
intakes
here we go we're gonna make this super
super simple under
0.5 grams per pound of body weight per
day of protein
is a hard no for muscle gain so don't
even bother with it
right 0.5 grams and if you can look over
at the chart it says figure 6 there
that's from the
uh rough draft of the rp diet book 2.0
okay which is going to explain this much
better than i am in this lecture i'm
sure
i wonder who wrote that book so um we
have on the x-axis here
we have grams of protein per pound per
day and on the y-axis we have a benefit
to body composition performance
and sort of on the y-negative we have a
risk to health you can see that graph
as it starts out at zero grams of
protein all the way uh on the left side
of the x-axis
there's like actually a pretty decent
health risk there because zero grams of
protein sooner or later you're just
gonna like wither off and die
as you raise your protein intake you
don't get any benefits to body
composition or performance
at all until you get roughly
to 0.5 grams of protein per pound of
body weight per day
that fills our essential needs of
protein
and gets us enough protein to where
anything above that
the essentials are met and now we can
boost our body composition
and our performance which again are
luxury items and they're not attended to
until our basics are met
so anything under 0.5 grams of protein
per pound of body weight is a hard note
very few people say that but a lot of
times people say the super anti-protein
advocates will say like oh man you don't
need an excess like i actually remember
in our um cafeteria in my university
which i went to as an undergraduate
uh there was like a really old school
nutritional
pamphlets there and they were like
athletes don't need any more protein
than regular people it's like complete
nonsense was totally insane
so if you want to gain any muscle under
uh 0.5 grams per pound of body weight
per day
an example of that is if you're 200
pounds and you want to gain muscle you
eat less than 100 grams of protein a day
you're just losing your mind there's no
way you're going to grow any appreciable
muscle
now next we go back to the graph here
and or forget the graph really quick so
so let's just read the stuff on the left
0.75 grams to 1 gram per day is just
fine in most cases
so we've reached an interesting point
here where
the benefit to body composition
performance we're looking on the graph
and
uh figure six over here on the right
hand side between points b
and c point seven five and
uh one gram per pound of protein per day
right
so between b and c like if you look at
how high up in benefit
b is it's pretty close to c
c is the optimal right and and so
0.75 grams is b so for if someone's
eating 0.75 grams so basically if
someone is 200 pounds
and they're trying to gain muscle on 150
grams of protein
especially if they're consuming enough
calories if they're hypercaloric
it can be done and it can be done pretty
effectively and
if if you wanted to drive a real hard
bargain
you could say that there's not a ton of
research to say that there's a
real just important head over heels
dying knee deep more than that
that if someone's eating 0.75 you can't
really fault them they're probably
getting
enough protein but there's some good
evidence to show that all the way up to
about a gram per pound of body weight
per day
is uh where things max out anywhere
between 0.751 gram is just fine in most
cases so if someone comes to you and
they're like hey i'm trying to gain
muscle it's not working
you know i'm eating 0.87 or 0.85 grams
of protein per pound per day you could
be like
that's probably not your problem right
makes sense pretty pretty
straightforward all right
next we see that a gram per pound to a
gram and a half
is probably more than nearly anyone
needs there's two ways to look at that
more than really anyone needs means is
too much but also because we can't say
one gram is too much
we can say that one gram to a gram and a
half is like an insurance policy level
of protein
right if we look at the graph on the
right hand side that's between points c
and d
we see that there's a flat lining of
benefit to body composition performance
if you take your protein you go from one
gram up to 1.5 grams
you just don't see any benefit right in
almost any
situation certainly not in gaining
muscle
so it's it's really a trip but what is
really
what we can really take away from this
is the following
that if someone comes to you and they
say hey look i'm eating and they say any
number between a gram of protein and 1.5
that's the end of the discussion about
protein right unless there's a timing
issue or something on a quality issue if
it's all just like gluten
right a third of it's not even getting
there or two thirds is not even gonna
digest and absorbed
that's a problem but generally speaking
a gram to a gram and a half of protein
is
golden i mean you're just totally fine
nothing to worry about and as a matter
of fact someone could probably make a
convincing case that if you eat less
like closer to that gram
or just beneath it you might actually
benefit in a variety of other ways now
1.5 grams and above and the graph that's
point d
and everything to the right of point d
on the x axis all the way up to two
grams and even further
is actually too much protein now let's
be very specific it's not too much
protein because that's unhealthy for you
uh eating protein up to an absurd amount
for a long time has been directly tested
it's totally healthy if you have normal
kidney function
and there's nothing sort of toxic about
there's nothing no magical effect
of the protein like reducing muscle
growth some kind of chemical level like
if you have too much your body's like no
i can't grow any muscle
here's what it is it's by something
called as a caloric constrained
hypothesis if you read our pdi 2.0 you
get to hear all about it galore
constraints as
i've called it hypothesis before it can
be called a concept which is pretty
pretty solid
caloric constraint is so says something
just very obvious is that if you
have your calories set at whatever level
you need which we already set our
calories earlier right
let's say 3000 calories
your proteins carbs and fats are just
split up into those calories
and if you say i want to eat two grams
of protein per pound of body weight
instead of one
what you're in effect saying is i want
no additional benefit
right because you're not getting any
benefit past one gram we said for sure
like this is not any benefit
right let's say past 1.5 for sure no
benefit
so you say i want to eat 2 grams
everything from 1.5 to 2 grams you're
basically saying okay i know there's not
going to be a benefit there
but it says too much what does too much
mean well here's the thing
those let's say 50 grams of protein or
something or
you know 80 grams of protein that's from
1.5 to 2 grams per pound per day
that's carbs you could have eaten that's
fats you could have eaten
fats have hormonal benefits they can
increase your testosterone carbs have a
ton of benefits we'll go through in just
a bit
real big deal so if you know a lot of
people say you know how much protein
should eat like the more the better well
that's not really true
because at some point it's not that
you're eating more protein it's that
you're eating less carbs that is optimal
it's that you're eating less fat than is
optimal
it's like someone could say you know i
love this job that i do like a career
that i have
and i want to work as many hours as
possible that's a good thing until
you're working so many hours that you
don't have time to eat so you start
losing weight you start getting in poor
health
that will prevent you from doing your
job unless you're taking so many hours
that you start
sort of missing out on the benefits of
hanging out with your family uh
taking care of your dog going to the
bathroom so sorry it's not
that you know a job you're passionate
about it's not that you're doing too
much more of the job
it's the job is getting so voluminous
that you're pushing out other things
that
also contribute to a good life and
possibly in certain
you know amounts contribute more to good
life than the good job once you have
enough of that good job so maybe
60 hours a week is fine once you start
getting to 80 it really starts to
interfere with the other stuff
so 1.5 grams of protein is too much
because you could be having other stuff
how do we apply this
if someone comes to us and says hey i'm
eating two grams of protein per pound of
body weight per day i'm trying to gain
mass
is that good you say well good that's
more than enough but what i'd really
like for you to do is go down to about
like
let's start with a gram and a half just
add more carbs in that would be more for
benefit because more protein past 1.5
for sure
just doesn't really do anything extra
right
so uh you know real super easy take home
advice is a gram protein per pound is
really a kind of golden number here
grand protein per pound of body weight
um no but a bit less is usually fine so
if someone's over 0.75 and they're not
complaining to you about
like if their gains are really crappy
and that's 0.75 is all they're eating
you can tell them hey let's bump the
protein up 50
30 40 grams just to make sure you're
close to one gram so we can just make
sure that's not the problem
right but if someone's like eating like
0.9 grams per pound of body or per day
and their gains are really good you
don't have to worry about protein it's
not something you need to optimize
one gram right around there is really
really good
carbs and why they matter all right
let's find out why carbs matter because
a lot of times people say okay i need a
certain amount of carbs
and then someone says why and they're
like i don't know like they're carbs
they're good
and it's all sort of been taught well
there's actually a lot of really good
reasons so
what are the potential benefits from
filling our discretionary calories
with carbs protein is actually an
essential nutrient you'll notice from
basic nutrition
fat is an essential nutrient so we have
to have a minimum protein amount of fat
we've already set a protein to optimal
and for sure need minimum fat we'll talk
about that later but like um
what's the benefit of using as much of
the remaining calories as possible
uh filled in with carbs well let's find
out number one
carbs when they're ingested secrete
insulin
more carbs eat the more insulin you
secrete over the time of the day so area
under the curve of insulin secretion is
higher
insulin is an unbelievable recovery tool
insulin starts a variety of cascades
inside muscle tissue
and inside all the tissues in your body
to recover various processes
to heal various things if you have a
higher insulin secretion your recovery
is better that's really good because you
can train more
you can recover from more you can get
bigger awesome
number two these are not an order of
importance by the way because number two
is probably more important than number
one
insulin mediated anabolism insulin is an
anabolic hormone it is
vastly anabolic in reviews of literature
even at normal doses that varying
doses of just normal humans insulin is
slightly anabolic
if you eat a really high carb diet like
600 grams of carbs per day
over and over and over the area under
curve insulin starts to add up to where
it becomes
pretty damn anabolic right so insulin
literally is a trigger for muscle growth
there's multiple
very well explained mechanisms how that
works especially in the presence of
resistance training hypercaloric diet
and a decent testosterone levels well if
you've got all those
you're good to go a lot of carbs goes a
long way
next up glycogen mediated
recovery by eating a lot of carbs you
keep your glycogen levels more full on
average
fuller glycogen stores allow you or a
really quick refilling of glycogen
stores
allows you to recover for hard training
sooner so instead of waiting a day and a
half
to train your biceps again you might
only have to wait a day or even half a
day you could train them later the same
day if you eat a high carb diet you put
in more work
and you get more of a benefit number
four glycogen-mediated anabolism what
the hell does that mean well
glycogen literally activates muscle
growth
pathways if it's really full and if your
glycogen is really empty it actually
deactivates muscle growth pathways to
some extent
it's one of your body's many barometers
of nutritional status
so your muscle cell looks and be like
all right do we want to grow muscle
and someone's like hey glycogen how are
we doing i'm glad i can just like
i was like all right they have anything
left they're like no wait we need to
restock election before we grow a whole
lot of muscle like we're clearly under
fed
remember muscle growth not a top
priority so if glycogen is low muscle
growth like ah we're good we're not
gonna do this right
it's like the sea captain being like
should i set my table for dinner or oh
look there's like a
explosion in one of our reactors like
we'll just deal with that first before
we set the table for dinner right
but once glycogen is fully loaded once
everything's really good
muscle growth gets uh two thumbs up
right cisco and ebert
cisco and roper ebert's been dead for a
long time hasn't he
i'm sorry is a cisco still around
that sweet still kicking it all right so
glycogen media anabolism is definitely a
real thing there's a huge effect
in studies it's actually been quite well
supported uh it's not a massive effect
by itself but it definitely counts
so if you're eating like lots of fats
for example and you're still
hypercaloric but not a lot of carbs your
glycogen is kind of always a little
lower
you're going to feel it you're going to
get better results if you eat more carbs
uh carbs are anti-catabolic
uh as alternative to amino acids right
so
uh basically your body wants to eat
something
it wants an energy source it can eat
amino acids which would better be served
by going to muscle growth
but if you have a higher carb intake it
just eats the carbs first and the amino
goes i don't care about you and the
amino acids shuffle around and maybe
they'll find some muscle growth
absolutely works in this way carbs are
also anti-catabolic
via cortisol carbohydrate intake
decreases cortisol
cortisol burns muscle breaks down muscle
no-brainer right really really important
thing
and carbs also uh because they reduce
cortisol
reduce fatigue cortisol is a
pro-fatiguing hormone like if you high
cortisol secretion you literally become
fatigued because of that
and uh you keeps your overall fatigue
down you eat lots of carbs you just
recover
better on every state and you can
produce more high quality training and
thus get more gains
really quick there back to point number
two on the insulin-mediated anabolism
direct anabolism for insulin at normal
concentrations not injectable insulin
like some bodybuilders use
is pretty decent nothing to write home
about it's not an incredible effect
but insulin grows muscle in some sense
because it is really anti-catabolic and
we could add that to the list but i
suppose it's just so related to number
two we could
put it in there insulin is unbelievably
anti-catabolic
so if you have insulin around your
chances for muscle breakdown are really
low remember we were talking about in
the first lecture that
needless fractional breakdown rate can
be kept low then our fsr can be much
higher unless we grow muscle well there
you have it
let's say if you're always eating carbs
or not always eating lots of carbs
throughout the day
secreting plenty of insulin you're just
really ensuring yourself against muscle
loss
and of course providing all the raw
materials via calories training and
protein for muscle gain
and all of a sudden uh you're getting a
lot more muscle so carbs
definitely have their distinct benefits
now
that being said how do you choose your
carb intakes well a really simple way to
do it
uh to choose the sort of the minimum
carbs that you would need to for sure
check
all the major boxes is to scale it off
work effort
right so if it's a very light training
day or an off day you're not training at
all at least a gram per pound probably
takes care of all your sort of blood
glucose level
all that other stuff if you're moderate
training you know like sets of
you know i don't know like you know
eight sets total of biceps and shoulders
that day and a little bit of cardio or
something like that
1.5 grams of carbs per pound of body
weight it's a good start and if you're
training really hard
legs back so on and so forth really high
volume crossfit workouts
two grams or more uh is is probably a
really really good idea
here's another method for determining
carbs you get your protein to needed
levels gram per pound or so
your fat intakes needed levels we'll
talk about that in just a bit as to what
that really means it's not that much fat
it turns out
and then you fill in the rest with carbs
that way you more than meat
all of these minima for sure and you get
all the benefits
of adding carbs as much of them as
possible from that last slide and as you
notice there's a lot of benefits not all
of them are very big ones
but they all add up to make a meaningful
difference
if you really like to eat a variety of
foods and you like higher
fat foods like avocados and nuts and
olive oil stuff like that you really
love
the way that stuff tastes and you're
maybe looking to
put on some muscle but you're not like
super dedicated about being a
bodybuilder or something like that
i think going off a higher fat intake
with at least enough carbs
from this scaled off work effort chart
here is totally cool i've done it like
that
many times and i've gained plenty of
muscle that being said
if you want maximum muscle gains i would
personally recommend
uh going with the relatively low fat
intake
and the way high carb intake it's worked
really well in the past and the
theoretical stuff
is definitely there to support it all
right
fats the bastard stepchild
of the nutritional world they're you
know
coming up to your rainy you know english
cottage window and
looking at you a sad face and you close
the blinds because you don't want to see
them but you later
put out a food bowl to make sure they
don't starve to death what's the deal
with that how's that for an analogy
huh there we go it's getting late here
folks all right so why fats matter
here's the deal
essential fats are fats that by
definition your body does not produce
and thus
needs to be consumed from external
sources they are must to consume
not quite clear how many of those we
need we'll talk about that in a bit but
essential fats have to consume so you
can't have a zero fat diet that's out of
the question
fat support hormone levels right they
support testosterone levels
there's a little bit of a conflicting um
uh sort of
topography of the research i've been
using that word a lot lately i love it
love it
uh the landscape of the research is a
little bit confusing as to hormone
levels
it seems that with the numbers that
we're talking about in minimum later
the hormone levels are pretty decent
there's a little bit of limited research
to support that
fat intakes that are pretty high
actually
still continue to boost testosterone
production
[Music]
up for debate whether or not that's
really worth it here's why
within normal ranges of testosterone
production um
[Music]
you basically have this thing um and i
believe the reference values are
something like 300 to
uh you know 300 plus nanograms per
deciliter and there's more than area
after that
it's not really clear or 300 to 700
which is the sort of normal reference
range
it's not really clear that variations
without range have a real profound
effect on muscle gains
clearly over time they're going to but
maybe not a huge effect
so maybe chasing hormone levels by
themselves with higher and higher fat
intakes
gets us a little screwed over on the
other hormone levels that are supported
by higher carb intakes for example
insulin
right i'll tell you this
in in the community of individuals that
use exogenous hormones bodybuilders that
use drugs
the modern approach to gaining as much
muscle as possible is to use a
not a minimum but a decent baseline of
exogenous
steroids like testosterone but to
secrete
or inject a whole lot of insulin and
that's how you get
huge right that's modern bodybuilding
you know ronnie coleman size
people have tried the other way around
where they don't mess with insulin much
or use very little of it and use a whole
lot of testosterone and they get bigger
but it's not quite the same level of
size
so even from that perspective we start
to see that yes fat support hormone
levels and there's a minimum that has to
be required
but that might not mean we need to chase
the uppermost hormone levels
testosterone levels for fat consumption
because just looking at testosterone
levels we could be missing insulin
levels so on and so forth and all the
other benefits
of the carbohydrates would be missing
out by keeping our fats that high so
some food for thought there here's
another one fats can add a lot of
calories
like with a lot of people who even if
they you know their goal isn't to just
you know eat
you know sort of a good mix of foods and
a lot of fats even if they just want to
be as pure to bodybuilding as they can
and gain as much muscle as they can a
lot of times
people are really hard gainers or really
physical jobs i can't physically eat any
more carbs
i can't get any weight if fats are 9
calories per gram
they're super easy to eat you can mix
them into whatever and all of a sudden
fats are a pathway by which you can
really gain weight super easily
it's definitely an option right that's
definitely a plus side of fats
now there are some downsides fats are
the most lypogenic nutrient lipogenic
means the generation of fat tissue
why are fats lipogenic because they're
already fats right people say
you know so postulate how much protein
gets converted and you know they say
carbs are what causes people to be fat
and
because they turn to fat and they do but
what turns to fat better than fat well
doesn't have to turn it at all like you
eat fat and then you know it goes into
your lymph and then it goes in your
bloodstream it just goes right to the
fat cells and then you're
fucking fat piece of shit like that's
how easy it is because people say like
oh i'm eating a bunch of bacon and
peanut butter and i'm a fat burning
machine yeah you're burning the fat
you're eating
and not burning any of your own body fat
so fats are definitely the most
lipogenic nutrient if you eat a really
high fat and high carb and high protein
diet
your chances of a lot of that fat going
into fat storage are pretty decent but
if you eat
pretty low fats and lots of carbs and
protein your chances of storing fat are
a little bit smaller not a ton but a
little bit smaller right
and probably the bigger problem here is
that too high fat intakes can prevent
high carb intakes and the many many
benefits so
notice the benefits of fats here like
now they're you know essentially you
need some and
there's a hormone level thing but
apparently it doesn't stretch as far as
we think
uh and it can add a lot of calories it
carbs can do almost all that stuff and
weigh more as we saw in
two slides ago so there's definitely
something to be said for not cutting
carbs
uh shy and if you too many fats you
might not be getting enough carbs
to really maximize stuff so how do we
choose fat intakes well
uh the thing is is that when you look
into the literature on
the minimum amount of fat you need to
consume it isn't really clear what that
number
is because if you let's just look at the
theoretical literature and some of the
animal studies i've done the amount of
essential fats you have to consume
um can be like five grams a day or less
five grams a day i mean good god that's
like two fish oil tabs and you're just
good to go
uh it's it's probably more than that but
maybe not much more it's really really
hard to say
that being said one of the ways to
estimate that your fat intake is a
little too low is if your sax drive
starts to suffer
a very good ecological correlate and
it's been observed through myself
tons of people i've talked to uh and
just generally
uh sort of reported that anything below
0.3 grams per pound per day
even in hyper-caloric conditions seem to
impact sex drive
quality of training and a bunch of other
things 0.3 grams per pound so that's
basically like if you weigh
200 pounds anything below 60 grams of
fat per day
is possible it could work totally fine
but you're kind of risking like maybe
maybe it's just not enough right maybe
it's not enough to maximize even sort of
the low end hormonal level stuff
and on the other side uh levels of up to
0.5 grams per pound are okay so it's
like 100 grams of fat
if you weigh 200 pounds but higher carbs
instead are probably best above
that so um one of my friends
in the industry is actually a
pharmacologist
broderick chavez what he says is you
know around 0.5 grams per pound
um and below fats is a high carb diet
if you get above 0.5 grams it's a mixed
diet
right it's not really high carb and
you're starting to probably miss out on
some of those benefits of high carbs
whereas like if you go from point five
to point four to point three
are you getting more effects of the
carbs yeah but maybe they're not traded
off so well against the fat stuff
so how do we get to sort of working
uh recommendation here well you know
your starting point for fats if you're
just coming to sort of the super new you
don't know how your own body responds
yet
0.4 grams per pound per day right so
basically if you're 200 pounds
80 grams of fat per day you can have a
lot of really good food
with that and then you want to toggle it
up and down
to judge hormonal responses versus more
car potential so on and so forth let me
give you an example of how that works
you start at 0.4 grams per day you go up
to 0.5
if you don't really notice an increase
in sex drive you don't notice an
increase in the sort of
like you know for you know how how viral
you're feeling
your training isn't going anywhere
better and you actually notice that
because you have less carbs
uh your pumps aren't as good your
recovery is not as great so you're like
okay it's clearly just not worth the
trade-off for carbs
you go all the way down to 0.3 and you
notice
that you know your uh sex drive
your kind of like desire to train isn't
that great um and you sort of crave fats
um and your pumps would be good if you
wanted to train
raw really hard but you don't okay uh so
you're kind of like ah that was too low
and you go back to point four and
everything seems to be perfectly
balanced that's an example of how it
works so potentially
you go up to point five and everything
feels great you still get great pumps
but your testosterone's super high it's
all great
awesome and then just stay at point five
if you go down to point three and
everything's perfect and even better
like you get nasty pumps and still
everything's fine
you could potentially go down to point
two and see how that works it probably
won't work great don't have any high
expectations
but if point two works out super great
for you you could just stay there
if you like that sort of trade-off if
you like eating carbs more of the fat so
on and so forth what i will say is this
if you're going much below 0.3 you're
chasing something that probably just
doesn't have a whole lot of benefits so
get that support
what's up next next lecture is going to
be lecture three we're going to talk
about timing
and food composition and supplements not
generally but specifically for muscle
gain
folks i'll see you then
