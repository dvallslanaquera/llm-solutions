stop assuming that just because you
don't feel a muscle during a movement
doesn't mean it's not being trained well
and it's not growing if you're
performing a movement well the target
muscle will be getting stimulus whether
you feel it or not in fact it's not even
that clear that focusing on the Mind
muscle connection is all that important
for muscle growth at all especially when
you're neutral lifting you will often
have trouble feeling the target muscle
during a given exercise the feeling will
come focus on good execution training
close to failure and you will get great
growth in the meantime
