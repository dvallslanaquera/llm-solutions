most guys get this completely wrong they
have unrealistic ideas about how this
applies in the real world and it just
ends up working against them in the long
run
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today a bit of a
different topic we're going to discuss
the question of
which body type women find most
attractive and i'm going to give you
my thoughts on this subject reason being
that when a lot of guys get into lifting
becoming more attractive to women is a
lot of the time one of their primary
motivations
and as somebody who's been in the gym
consistently for a very long time now
coming up on 20 years now
and who's had every physique type
imaginable from a really lean
sub 10 body fat in the low 160s up to a
more middle ground
body fat and middle ground muscularity
between about 170 to 180 pounds which is
where i'm at now
up to a bulkier bodybuilder type of
physique around 190 pounds
a bear mode physique in the low 200s and
of course a sloppy
sweaty full on dirty bulked 230 pounds
with a very high body fat percentage
and pale saggy man titties to go along
with it okay because
of my experience with having all of
these different physique types i wanted
to give you my personal insight on this
topic

i'll be
to do these sorts of videos again in the
future so what i would say
first and foremost in response to this
question of which body type will make
you most attractive to women
whether it's the lean aesthetic
hollywood type of look or a more
muscular bulkier type of look
or something in between i would say that
it actually does not matter nearly as
much as you might think and i wouldn't
recommend that you base the end goal of
your training around what you think is
going to make women
like you the most and there are a few
important reasons for this
okay the first reason is that body type
preferences can differ quite a bit
between
different women this is really something
that i've learned over the years from my
own observation
and my own interactions there's really
no such thing as one type of
ideal physique in the first place some
women prefer a leaner more athletic look
some like guys who carry a bit more
muscle some like the bigger fluffier
look and find that to be more masculine
and more attractive
even if you don't have a single ab in
sight and some even prefer
a more slender build you know like a
swimmer's body type for example a type
of physique that most people in the
online fitness community would classify
as
do you even lift status so no matter
what type of physique you have
assuming you're within a healthy body
fat range okay if your boobs are hanging
lower than hers she's probably not going
to be very into that
oh do you find me sexy but if you're
within a healthy body fat range and
you're carrying
some noticeable muscle so that it's
obvious that you work out which is a
signal that you're healthy and you take
care of yourself there's always going to
be a percentage of women out there who
consider that to be their preferred type
and a percentage who don't now that said
if your goal was to cast the widest net
possible
then probably i would say a middle
ground aesthetic slash
athletic look that's probably going to
appeal to the highest percentage overall
meaning
some decent muscular development but not
over the top and some visible muscle
definition but also not excessively lean
i'd say probably somewhere between
about 10 to 14 body fat that would
probably appeal most
to the average woman out there on
average women tend to lean towards a
more natural look
and if you're excessively muscular or
you're excessively lean it will actually
be considered
less attractive again on average okay
keep that phrase in mind because again
there are still plenty of women all over
the map with varying preferences
and if you're just going out
consistently and meeting different
people then you're going to come across
all different types of women
so if i had to give one answer to this
question and the goal was to be as
attractive as possible across the board
then
the middle ground athletic slash
athletic look that's probably going to
be ideal
as opposed to being absolutely shredded
or looking like a full-on bodybuilder
however the other thing to consider too
is that if you do have a more
sort of polarizing physique like a very
muscular bodybuilder look for example
yeah some women are not going to be a
fan of that they're going to think that
you look too big
but then for that percentage of women
who are into that sort of look
usually those are the girls who are
really into fitness themselves
they're really going to like it because
it's less common and it stands out
so casting a wider net isn't necessarily
the only strategy okay you can either go
wide
with more moderate appeal to a larger
audience or you can specialize and
really appeal strongly to a narrower
audience and as long as you're a
reasonably social person
and you're going out and meeting people
regularly you're still going to have
plenty of success both ways
and let me know in the comments what
your personal approach is with this and
how it's worked for you
okay is there a specific body type that
you found gives you the highest degree
of success
with women in dating or is it something
that you personally just don't really
care about and if you're a female and
you're watching this then comment below
in terms of what your personal
preference
is so the first reason to not obsess
over this question is because as long as
you are in shape in general then you're
always going to have a
target market no matter what now the
second reason why i wouldn't recommend
getting
overly wrapped up in this question is
that on average
the real truth is that most women don't
actually care about your physique
as much as you might think okay some do
and so it will help with those women
but on average it's not as critical a
factor as you've been led to believe
by a lot of fitness marketers out there
in fact other guys at the gym
or in social gatherings they're probably
the ones who are paying the most
attention to your physique
rather than the women in general your
physique is really just one small piece
of what makes up
your overall attractiveness as a man and
there are a lot of other factors that
come into play okay
facial features height socioeconomic
status
confidence basic obvious things like
your hygiene you know how you dress
and also very importantly just the
general chemistry that you have with
another person
depending on how your personalities
match up if you meet someone and you
have that natural chemistry with them
then your exact physique type is not
going to be some sort of critical
deciding factor um it just isn't okay
i'm 34 now and i've observed
more than enough social interactions
over the past 20 years
to know this for sure in fact some of
the guys that i know who have had the
most success with women were not in any
sort of
overly impressive physical shape so your
physique is just one piece of the
overall equation
and i would say that it's actually a
smaller factor than most guys
who first get into lifting realize again
i'm speaking on average here okay some
women really do love when a guy is lean
and muscular and in great shape
and it will have a bigger effect on them
but on average across the entire
population at large
it's really not as important as you
might think and then the third thing
that i would say is that
paradoxically if you're obsessing over
your physique and you're revolving
everything that you do in the gym
around trying to make women like you
then i would say that you're actually
operating from the wrong mindset to
begin with
and that that's probably going to come
through in your interactions because
you're in such an approval seeking
mindset and that's something that women
are definitely
not attracted to obviously it's
completely normal to
take those external steps to improve
your sexual market value in terms of
your appearance and your finances and
your lifestyle and all that stuff
but it also shouldn't be something that
you're completely obsessing over
otherwise you're just not in the right
frame of mind you're stuck in that
full-on
approval seeking mode and that's going
to hurt your chances a lot more
than whether you are 10 body fat versus
15
or whether your arms are 15 inches
versus 17 inches
so what you want to do is take those
external steps
those external actions to improve
yourself but to not get overly attached
to them either
it's just something that you're doing as
part of your overall life but at the end
of the day
you are okay with yourself regardless
it's important in life if you don't give
a [ __ ]
it can help you a lot not to mention
that if you're living the lonesome
bodybuilder lifestyle
which i've done in the past where i was
literally doing nothing except training
and working
um that's fine for temporary periods if
you're really trying to focus and excel
in those areas
but if you're spending all your free
time in the gym and thinking that you're
some sort of badass because you're doing
deadlifts at
10 30 pm on a friday night while
everybody else is out and about
i am responsible for my dreams i am
responsible for my results
because i am the only one who can stop
me from turning my dreams
into a reality i have the power to make
my dream happen
i have the choice to decide if i will
work hard for
and you have this silly idea in your
head you know you've bought into the
marketing that if you just get into
great shape then all the women are going
to come flocking to you
i can promise you nothing is going to
happen your social skills and your
social confidence
are just going to gradually degrade and
you're going to become more and more
isolated and it doesn't matter how good
you look or how much money you're making
you're not going to meet anybody and
even if you do you'll have spent so much
time alone and will be so stuck in your
head
that you won't even be able to have a
normal interaction oh no not you
hi um uh how are you doing okay okay
see and as somebody who is naturally
more on the introverted side and
has essentially removed himself from
society in the past
so that he could focus 100 on training
and working
trust me i have been there rule number
one if you want to have success with
women in dating
is that you have to leave the house you
know you actually have to go out and
socialize
as revolutionary as that advice might
seem not only because
that gives you opportunities to meet
people but also for the sake of keeping
your social skills intact
or improving your social skills if you
are someone who's naturally more on the
shy or awkward side
so forget this idea that you're gonna
mold the perfect physique and then all
of a sudden become some sort of dating
powerhouse
it can definitely help you and like i
said before a temporary phase of single
pointed focus is fine
but all in all obsessing over your
physique is not the way to become
successful in
this area maximize your appearance yes
but you actually have to go out and
interact with people as well
and just to end this on a practical note
all i would say is that physique wise
what truly does matter and what truly
will affect your success with women
is that you're simply within a healthy
body fat range so ideally
uh no higher than 18 to 20 maximum
if you are overweight and if you're
carrying a significant amount of excess
fat then yes that absolutely is going to
negatively impact your attractiveness
not to say that you can't still attract
a certain segment of women if you are
carrying more fat
but your success definitely will
increase significantly if your body fat
is at a healthy level
and then on the other end of the
spectrum if you're significantly on the
thinner side
again not some sort of deal breaker
across the board some girls won't really
care
but if you are quite thin and then you
go ahead and add some solid muscle to
your overall frame
that is going to help you out overall as
well by allowing you to appear
more physically dominant so my basic
recommendation to tie this all together
is to train consistently eat well be
within a healthy body fat range and
carry some noticeable muscle mass
so that it's obvious that you work out
because that is a signal that you have
self-discipline you take care of
yourself but that beyond those basic
things
where your physique specifically falls
on the spectrum of size and leanness
that should be based on what you most
prefer where you're most comfortable
what makes you feel the best and what
puts you in the best frame of mind
not what you think is going to make
women like you the most most guys get
this completely wrong
they have unrealistic ideas about how
this applies in the real world
and it just ends up working against them
in the long run again women have
varying preferences to begin with they
generally don't care about your physique
as much as you might think
and placing too much of your energy on
your physique is just a misallocation of
your effort
if success with women in dating is a
primary goal for you
