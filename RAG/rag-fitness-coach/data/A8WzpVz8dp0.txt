muscle gain dieting made simple video
number nine
long-term muscle gain i'm doctor mike
from science periodization
let's get into it last time in video
number eight we finished learning a few
things
how to set up and execute a muscle gain
phase how to set up an executive
postdiet maintenance phase
to make sure those gains stick and how
to do
a mini cuts to prime your body for
another phase of
training and gaining and eating and all
that good stuff
but what if you want more than just
another gain phase what if you want
tens of pounds of muscle growth we have
some
pretty good tips for your long-term
muscle growth aspirations
just to make sure that you have the
right frame of mind to stay on that long
major rule before we start the tips is
that you cannot rush the process
okay a bunch of ways people like to rush
the process
including going over the 0.5 percent of
weight per week
maximum rule the dirty bulk the dirty
bulk makes you dirty
if fat was dirt right so if you want to
get super fat and unhealthy i've done it
a ton i still have stretch marks from it
fuck that okay don't do that it doesn't
work
going much over 16 weeks at a time okay
the question isn't can you sort of
metabolically gain muscle for long
durations like 20 or 24 etc weeks you
can
question is can you with appropriate
training volume and intensity
consistently train harder and harder and
harder for longer than 16 weeks
without some kind of reduction in
training volume which would necessitate
a reduction in calories so you're not
just gaining pure fat
the answer to that is probably not so
anytime people tell me oh yeah man
muscle gain phase 30 weeks
straight and i'm like no brakes in there
for maintenance or mini cut like nope
just go in the entire time
i'm inclined to believe you're not
training that hard if you're training
appropriately hard with appropriate
volume
appropriate frequency you probably need
to break once every 16 weeks some people
need a break much
more frequently than that skipping
maintenance and many cut phases
fuck that i'm not here to maintain i'm
here to gain bro sweet you'll get so
fatigued that you won't be able to train
hard or you get hurt
skipping many cuts is all fine and dandy
if you want to get really fat at the end
of that process if you don't want to get
fat if you want decent amount of muscle
without as much fat or without any mini
cuts are a really good idea
so three tips for long-term muscle gain
granted that big major tip up front
first perform each of the gain maintain
mini cut phases
sometimes you can expect a longer cut
will be needed to renorm leanness
like if over the last couple of these
phases yeah you mini cut and you lost
most of the fat but not all that you
gained
and now you're like pretty fat and just
a mini cut won't cut it sometimes maybe
you need an eight to ten week
classic fat loss phase to really get the
weight off and then after that a little
bit of an active rest and then you
restart the process
and sometimes you get really tired
really beat up or you go on a vacation
and a longer maintenance is needed maybe
six weeks maybe eight
maybe you get really bored and burnt out
you want to do some power lifting a
strength training totally fine maintain
that whole time
and then get back into things but
generally speaking it's going to be that
triple cycle gain
maintain mini cut slash cut of some kind
and then
restart and you go all the way up like
that there are many other ways to do
this
i'd say it's probably one of the best
maybe not the best but it's the best one
i know
number two continue to experiment with
exercises
and techniques and programs that work
best okay
in addition to that consider priority
phases for various muscle groups so you
say okay this
macro cycle okay this entire training
phase
i am really hitting my chest and my back
fucking hard
shoulders biceps triceps a little less
hard legs as hard as i've ever been
hitting them
then the next macro cycle you switch
torque fucking arms and shoulders
really getting jacked chest and back
still gonna grow a little bit but not as
much
your body can really grow some muscles
best
when it focuses on them how many muscles
as many as you can recover from so if
you can
fucking hammer your entire body without
systemic fatigue
do it but most of you folks get more
advanced you'll notice that if you're
trying to train your whole body hard
it all kind of trains to turns into dog
shit you're so tired from everything you
can't do it
maybe to start taking one or two muscles
put them on the back burner training
everything else hard
when you become really advanced you may
only be able to train half or two-thirds
of your body really hard at a time and
the other
half to a third will need to be
maintenance volume or minimum effective
on
really kind of more advanced stuff but
hey you want long-term muscle gain
you'll have to do some advanced shit
if you really really want to know more
the nuances here go to the hypertrophy
made simple series
click on that what's one of our videos
here at rp and it'll really get you
going on what kind of training
sort of we really talk about we're
talking about exercise selection and all
this other stuff
number three huge one expect your gains
to slow
you may gain 15 pounds of muscle your
first year your second year you may get
it may gain only 10. your third year you
may gain only
five your fourth year maybe only four
and then three and then two and then two
and then three and then two and stuff
like that
people get fucking brutally demotivated
from this
they miss their noob gains and they just
burn out and a lot of those people don't
get super jacked
but remember what i said at the end
there it's like four and three and three
and two and three and three and two and
three if we take that little string of
threes and twos
that's five years where adding it all up
is another 15 pounds of muscle
you have someone that quit or just
didn't want to do the hardcore shit
and they quit after five years of
training and you have another person
that quit after 10
because that person at five years year
six they tried but they're only gaining
like two pounds of muscle they're like
dude fuck that
what am i gonna do gain two pounds of
muscle a year i don't want that any of
that shit
the person who persevered for another
five years
two and three and two and three add up
to some shit and all of a sudden they're
12
pounds of muscle bigger and that's a big
deal for most people
and you look at a guy that's super
jacked i'll tell you right now the
one most common unifying characteristic
of people that are really jacked is
they've been training for a long time
okay five years 10 years 15 years
plus if you keep going not being
discouraged by how slow the gains are
coming
you make gains you make amazing gains it
adds up over the long term
right remember that and all the size
your genetics have for you
will be yours it's just going to take a
long time be patient
be realistic time is the big factor of
success with muscle growth fat loss you
fuck anyone
unless you're morbidly obese you can get
lean in half a year no big deal
then people think oh half a year of
getting lean that means happier for
muscle growth right bullshit
it takes years and years and years
consistency and hard training
and time right it's like a witch's brew
you pour all them shits in
jack people come out now what if you
want to get
exotically big how does that change
what are the differences that'll be our
last video in the series it'll be the
next one next week
see you guys then
