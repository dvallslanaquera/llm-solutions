yo what up what's up youtube i'm dr mike
this
is a hamstring curl machine jk leg
training i know like a lot of times that
we've done the youtube videos before
it's kind of like a week thing a week of
training or some kind of special thing
lots of like artistic with super
slow reps and music we'll have some of
that in here today but this is just like
a regular training video like to be
honest this is just like week three or
week no it's week two
of my regular plan of just like the
beginning of uh a cutting block so
i'm just here at uh crocs gym
in uh what is this novi michigan yeah
yeah so it is so what if it is
and uh great gym uh i train here for a
while until hopefully we can get like
something set up a little closer to home
uh but uh yeah leg day today is gonna be
leg curls then leg press then high bar
squat let's uh have some fun and like a
lot of the shots today are going to be
like what i normally like as far as
emotional
uh with training uh usually you'll
notice i just mostly bs and when it
comes time to decide i get serious and
when it's not set doing then who knows
what i'll say
see you then
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
yay
that was a my rep set
so the goal is 17 reps because last we
got 16
and
i do as many as the first set i get all
17.
second set sometimes 17 sometimes my 15.
take a breather and get two and this was
the third set
so did 14 took a breather and got three
um that's how we're doing it so my reps
look them up i should probably make a
video soon about what the those are
but you can google it
and if you can accurately pronounce the
name of the man that invented him
that's my best euro impression
you get bonus points
[Music]
oh yeah only 10 reps because
if i had a whole set
like of 17 that would have to be mile
reps so like one or two pauses
like i got very sore last time and
healed just on time if i had a whole new
set it's gonna be overkill i'm not gonna
heal on time for the next workout
so i just add basically a set of ten
which is like
two or three rer not my rep and that
really gets a good stimulus just as much
stimulus as i need to keep making it
hard
er i came off awkward and not so much
that i get too sore that's it
[Music]
so we got hamstrings out of the way
leg press time time for quads calves i
do in a different day so it's not legs
entirely
common question i get is why do i
sometimes do leg curls before
squats and leg presses why are
isolations for compounds
in essence there's two factors
one
is if i do something easy like leg curls
before i still have tons of energy to
really do cause justice if i have to do
quads first anything i do to hamstrings
after would take like double the sets to
get the same effect
and that's sort of dovetails answer
number two is the stimulus to fatigue
ratio is thus better
like if i was looking for the most raw
stimulus magnitude for quads
then i would look of course to quads
first and probably squats first and then
leg presses after
but my quads go pretty easy relative to
everything else and
just doing a few more sets of
quads
uh it takes care of all the stimulus
that i need so because the fatigue is
more of a concern if i do leg presses
before squats it lowers the amount of
axial load load through the spine
brings the fatigue down the stimulus can
be adjusted by just doing a few more
apps and sets and then hamstrings
sometimes i do first if my lower back
stand involved because it can give me a
really big stimulus for hamstrings at
the beginning and then everything else
it's not a problem because actually
hamstrings like leg curl style are not a
limiting factor
for when you do squats and leg presses
after so that's generally the answer
yahoo
[Music]
[Applause]
uh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
what
doc and we'll move this star yes
leg press is done four sets
17 15 13 11 repetitions my rep style
pretty good stimulus it's actually the
same number of sets as last week but one
rep added to every set to push that rar
and same number of squats this week is
last week two sets
but uh same weight actually 365 pounds
total so
i'll be doing that
for uh hopefully
two sets of nine repetitions
interestingly enough because i'm pretty
adept at squats at this point my quads
are nice and pumped and sort of warmed
up from leg pressing
that i'm just gonna go straight into it
i wouldn't recommend that most cases
i've been training a real long time you
tried it before it's probably fine
and this isn't anywhere close to my
limit weight 10 rm or i think that so
just getting it right into it set a nine
rests at a nine
and call it a date buy a good stimulus
for quads next week based on us or get
how fatigued i'll probably increase by
one or two sets this workout of course
add a rep to everything and we'll
increase by 5 or 10 pounds
pretty boring at this point you guys
know how this works
let's get into these squats
uh
[Music]
yes
uh
[Music]
oh
i had a word shooting pain in my back
on that rep
that i like stopped at for a while
[Music]
all right uh same same nine reps my back
feels really interesting so
hopefully this works
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
all good
well
thank you so much folks
last set of squats
i actually hurt my back
in the middle of the first time
uh
took a little time between
like wrap number six number seven
figured
this kind of pain that didn't shoot
anything
just kind of in the mid back
didn't feel any worse
weird on the unrack weird between sets
great during the movement
ooh i'm out of breath
so
hopefully it'll be okay
think with pain
if it doesn't get any worse
especially if it gets better as you sets
which it did
it's probably not a big deal
famous last words
this is going to be a career ending
injury
guys
that's all i got today
i'll see what kind of youtube
like subscribe
tweet me cash app
venmo swipe you know the deal
see you next time
