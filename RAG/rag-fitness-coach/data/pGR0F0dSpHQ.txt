good to be back it's the bi-weekly
curious webinar where we answer
questions dr mike dr james how's it
going
james i'm doing well how are you i'm
good
i actually um uh psa i found a really
fun um
manga that i've been reading lately and
it's like the wildest thing i've ever
read ever and i've read a lot of pretty
stream statement from angus
yeah so uh it's called chainsaw man and
i can't even give it like a quick
synopsis
the brief so far is like this guy his
dad dies his he leaves him in debt
like unbelievable amounts of money with
the mafia he fuses with like a dog who's
a chainsaw devil and becomes like a
hybrid chainsaw demon guy and his like
goal
in life is to like honk some boobs
before he dies
and yeah wooden in-cell
fueled it's like totally bananas
and then there's a part where he
actually gets to honks and boobs and he
has an existential crisis because it
wasn't as exciting as he thought it
would
oh no so he's like whole world of shit
it's just like totally banana so if you
guys are looking for something fun to
read
chainsaw man i've been all all up in
that lately it's been good god damn
well i got hbo max for the purpose of
watching
the superman batman situation yes um
the snyder cut and that was a very very
good movie
and then i stayed around because there's
lots of good stuff on there and it turns
out they have the entire
superman the animated series cartoon oh
cool
yeah and i'm like oh i'll watch this uh
because it's the same team
and same artists as did justice league
and batman beyond so i'm like my
i usually like all this stuff there was
a but so there was like obviously there
was all the batman ones and there was so
many of those and then there was
there was superman and then there was
also batman and superman
all in that kind of dc animated like
late 90s universe
um there was a whole bunch that's cool i
didn't know they had that i've been on
the fence about getting hbo max for the
same reason of like do i want to watch
the snyder cut
because like you go online everyone says
like
way too long same movie it's a slug
and then he's online like instagram and
everyone's like holy shit that was
awesome you know what i mean like
james it is absolutely not the same
movie
that's kind of what i thought because i
was like there's different characters
like i don't have characters in it that
you never see in the other movie just
right how could it be the same movie
first of all there's dark or
yeah dark side like how could it be the
same
yeah and they explain everything so much
better that when it happens you're like
okay this makes a lot of sense
versus the other movie you're like what
like without spilling too much
the introduction you got of cyborg in
the other movie was like all right he's
upset
and he's a teenager and half his body's
metal sweet like it was like really like
just bullshit innuendos and hints this
spends like 45 minutes on cyborg
and it's fucking awesome that's sweet
this
like the um for we're probably nerding
out for so many of you right now
probably just like can you guys talk
about mrb
um but if you guys really liked who's
the nerd in that one
yeah exactly if you guys like the snyder
stuff like if so if you're somebody who
saw the new one um
read the the new 52 comic series because
all the ones that he was on were
fucking incredible they were some of the
some of my favorite comic book
um like little story arcs were in that
snyder ver you know his his
little comic world there so those are
really good make sure you check them out
and i'm guessing that he's probably
carrying over a lot of that into the
the movie which i'm excited for yeah it
was really good worth a watch
worth watching all right up first
is henrik anderson
mr anderson a lot of the top voted
comments were just comments and not
questions skip right over those
got it we did read them
all right you got them got them up
um henrik anderson says multiple studies
have shown that three daily meals can
fully stimulate muscle protein synthesis
and more frequent protein feedings don't
have any clear advantage when it comes
tinquishing muscle mass great news for
busy folks
do you agree thoughts fyi don't have
links for these exact studies matter
handsomely
often reverse these studies when he
questions when he gets questions about
meal frequency
uh i do think that is not entirely
correct is mostly correct but i think
there
is uh some advantage to going to four
and perhaps five meals
and i think that is well summarized by
brad schoenfeld he has a distinct
literature review
of anabolism and catabolism and where he
recommends his meal frequency
recommendations
i would look into brad schoenfeld's
literature review on meal frequency
and there's a few of them take the two
or three mostly uh or
two or three latest ones and that would
be
a good place to sort of open your mind
up a little bit
yeah i haven't looked at that particular
issue in a little while but
where i last stand stood on that was it
was kind of clear that like
less than three compared to like four or
more
is not great and it seems kind of like
somewhere between three and four is
probably like the
the cut off and probably could make a
good case for five but the good news is
there is if you're not someone
who is like a high level athlete whether
it's a physique athlete or otherwise
um it probably doesn't matter a huge
amount for you which is good and that's
kind of what we said in the rp diet 2.0
stuff like the timing is not a huge
factor so even then
you're talking about like a margin of a
margin in terms of like
your total success so if you're doing
most of the other things right like
whether you have three or four meals you
know it's
unless you're trying to be like a
professional athlete um it's probably
largely inconsequential in terms of
practical impact
yep all right
into castro in t that's a funny one
got it he says hi docs my question is
about progressive
progression slash change between blocks
and macro cycles you've put a very clear
system of progression within the muscle
cycle
with a match or beat strategy and
self-regulating the number of weekly
sets for a given muscle group
the way mesos change within a training
block is also er
explicit very nice word in your
hypertrophy made simple video series
now how about starting your next block
do you start at a higher point in terms
of reps and
wait in order to guarantee strength
progress alter the last block so we're
just going to go
right into this real quick your strength
progress either occurred or it didn't
and it occurred to a certain extent or
did not
if you start at a point of weight in
reps
that does not assume that you progressed
you will break through all of your
planned rep ranges on the first day
you're going to say oh you know 150
pounds on this chest press i should get
to between 10 and 15 reps which is my
goal
and at rep 17 at 6 rar you're gonna put
the weight down and be like yeah
fuck that up it'll very quickly become
apparent
where you should be you should know your
strength very well after an entire block
of training certainly after macro cycle
and then all you do is you take your
assumed current strength be a little
conservative but just be
realistic look at this next microcycle
you have of your first next block
microcycle
and pick the loads that will fall
roughly into the rep ranges i think and
take one two or three sets to adjust
those loads up and down if you make a
mistake
and then at the end of that whole
process you're well on your way so
do you start at a higher point in terms
of weight and reps in order to guarantee
strengthening is you're not guaranteeing
anything either got them or didn't
where you start like let's say you
didn't get any strength if you start
heavier
you're going to get eight reps instead
of 15 and you're like oh shit i guess i
didn't get stronger there's no
guaranteeing strength progress
by the way if you started higher ups and
you just train at higher ups that'll
keep all of your strength it'll just be
able to do it at a higher rep range now
if you want to make sure i think what
you're really asking is how do we know
how to get the kind of weights that fall
into our rep
ranges that we want and the way there is
you should kind of know that already and
also assume that you got a little
stronger and then
just start with something conservative
another great insight is warm up as you
warm up
you know like your last you do two reps
with 150 pounds
you can kind of feel out like oh is this
going to be tough for 12 or is it going
to be easy for 20. like you could
fucking tell
right i think if it's like oh this is
hard like yeah it's a good weight
maybe i'll just do 140 from it for a
second but if it's like you do the first
two and you're like
i could do that forever well clearly
it's not enough try to warm up again to
170 or something and see how that feels
so that question by itself james do you
have anything on just that
to add to that yeah and this will
probably spill over a little bit into
the other the other parts of the
question too but a lot of people think
like meso one meso two meso three or
whatever are just like distinct things
or they're like here's what i did here
here's what i'm doing here but really
it's more kind of like this where they
just tend to overlap so
what you'll probably find is that the
weights that you're using across
different mesocycles might repeat
themselves many many times over the
course of a block
and you might find yourself maybe ending
a little bit higher than you did across
maybe one or two mesos than you did on
the first mezzo
maybe maybe not everybody's different
but what we don't want to think of is
like okay
block a was here block b's up here block
c is somewhere way up here it's
you know more often than not you're
probably going to be using pretty
similar loads or even coming back to
loads that you had used previously
and then adjusting the rirs and rep
ranges you know to where they're
supposed to be
yep and then he says do you focus on
variation of training modality doing for
example a metabolite or strength focused
block
so you can do a strength focus block if
it makes sense um metabolite focus block
doesn't make any sense because metabolic
training doesn't usually work for much
longer very well than like a mesocycle
so you can always have some metabolite
in every single mesocycle
or you can have most of your metabolites
in the last mouse cycle but an entire
block of pure metabolite training
probably doesn't make a whole lot of
sense
and so if you focus on different rep
range the next question would be why
right why generally you want to bias
your training
into the rep ranges that give you the
highest sfrs and those really aren't
likely to change over the long term
um same question goes for macro cycle if
such a thing is even needed five percent
of course a macro cycle is not so much
needed but results in proper approach
for training being executed
you end up having macro cycles occur but
you probably don't need to make these
grand sweeping gestures so
what you want to do is just vary the
stuff that we know is needed for
variation so you absolutely want to vary
the exercises
and if you want to vary the rep ranges
or something like that you have to
answer yourself
a question of what's a good reason to do
so if you're thinking man you know
i trained really light this past whole
block and i just didn't get the gains i
wanted i remember like when i was
training heavier a few years back i
really got great gains
maybe this next block i'll try training
much heavier that's a good idea
but it has to come you know to goku
about the super saiyan transformation
has to come from a need not a desire
same idea like there's got to be a good
reason for it or at least a reason
and then you can examine later if that's
a good reason or not i wouldn't just
like vary shit for its own sake
none of the variation we do ever is for
its own sake unless you're bored and
want to do some other shit then just
vary within the constraints of shit
still working
we don't need to do is like do all sets
of five in a block of hypertrophy and
like
break your knees off of your fucking you
know legs because it's too much heavy
shit so i'm doing anything stupid but
within that
feel free to uh to vary it but there's
not a whole lot
of sequential face potentiation that
occurs block to block or macrocycle to
macro cycle those are much more
independent units
we're just trying to do a good job yeah
absolutely and so the kind of the key
here is auto-regulating based on the
need as mike already said i had kind of
an interesting anecdote that hit on
actually a couple of these points so
um the last block that i did i
introduced like a
like a chest supported spider curl just
because i needed some like i just really
needed to mix up my bicep training a
little bit
so the first mezzo was meant to do like
8 to 15 reps and that was just because i
had really had never done that
exercise before and of course you get
like rapid improvements for something
new so my progressions were basically
just increasing load
every single week for the first whole
mezzo just because it was a new novel
movement
the next meso i finally got to a load
that was challenging
right and then i could uh just basically
repeat same thing eight to 15 roughly
um kind of the same weights and then i
was using more of a volume based
progression once i was at loads that
were challenging enough for me
and then at some point that starts to
get a little bit stale and you can say
okay well now i'm actually pretty
acclimatized to this one and the third
one maybe i will change the rep ranges
to get the better sfr instead of eight
to fifteen it bumped up to ten to twenty
touch on the high end really really good
pumps a little bit of novelty from the
higher rep range
but guess what starting to go flat again
and then the last block what i did was
like a metabolite version of that where
it was like higher reps shorter rest
kept that movement going milked it as
far as i could
based on how i was feeling and how i was
responding to that movement
over the course of several months so
that's just an example where you might
see
those same the same questions being
addressed in different ways where you
might be
focusing on load as you make really
rapid neural improvements on a new
movement then you might be focusing on
volume then you might change things up
when it gets stale based on reps and
then you might even change something
like metabolite work
as you really have petered out on a
movement so that's just an example but
you kind of get the idea of
why you might choose to do some of those
things across the block
um up next right below at least in my
screen oh not on yours
let's see
[Music]
oh no oh no
let's search for it this is abdo
there it is there it is very short
question
what do you think of power building i i
think i know where this is going
couple things it's not a sport so
don't tell people you're a power builder
cause i don't mean any goddamn sense
actual bodybuilders and powerlifters
will laugh at you
i'm just kidding maybe they won't but it
certainly is not a sport making me laugh
i've almost spit my drink out
i'm sorry can you imagine like you're
talking a competitive power lifter
in the gym and he's like yes we got any
needs coming up you're like yeah i'm
power builder he's gonna be like uh
so when when's your company competition
for that well
it's not really a sport so power
building
is uh interesting name for
being jacked and also strong so
power building's number one thing is
nutrition of like don't eat like a piece
of shit like mary swizzinowski the
ultimate power builder who is a world
strongest man oh my god
it's like one of my favorites really
bodybuilding style nutrition almost all
year round
and that was one of the reasons he
looked like he did okay a lot of
strongmen just pound whatever he was
always eating clean
or almost always and that's a big part
of it another is
training the muscles that power lifters
generally don't train like
your outer lats and your side delts and
your biceps and your calves
uh yeah that will make you look like
that gives you that bodybuilder look
that physique look
and it's also about making sure to do a
little bit of extra volume
to get all your muscles a lot of
hypertrophy stimulus but to have the
core of your training still be
in the lower rep range just so you can
progressively get strong if you
really want to be as big as jacked and
strong as you can be you will do this on
a phasic approach
you take a few message cycles to really
push your strength up without conserving
your physique
then you take a few mesocycles of real
physique specific stuff while conserving
your strength
alternate alternating alternate
alternating over time you get really
really jacked and really
strong but just understand that there's
a trade-off here's the trade-off
if you want to be as strong as you
possibly can any amount of time you
spend on your physique that is not
related directly to improving your
strength
is time and resources taken away from
your strength abilities
on the other hand if you want to be the
best physique person you can
you're doing doubles and triples in the
squat and the deadlift you are
taking tons of energy away from your
adaptation and the ability to stimulate
gains
and you are also introducing a really
really much much categorically higher
risk
of injury than you would in any normal
hypertrophy training
which is why you see almost no almost
none of the top
power lifters are power builders and
almost none of the top bodybuilders are
power builders
um because they're focused on their task
at hand if you told most bodybuilders
hey like
here's your program but i want you to
also do sets of five in the squats of
three in the dead and
doubles in the bench they're going to be
like jesus christ it's going to leave me
real tired for
also like when i'm pre-contest and my
joints are all fucked up like fuck that
i'm not going to do that i'm training
for bodybuilding
and when you tell most power lifters
after they're tired and they've hit huge
prs for the session like hey you got to
stick around
and do three by ten pull downs and bicep
curls and side laterals are gonna be
uh i'm sorry for what they're like well
so you can look cool they're like i'll
give a shit and then just go home
so power building is is neat uh it's
neat uh and
it's best done physically a couple
massive cycles at a time of strength
focus hypertrophy focus strength focus
on performance
um when you can train on a more hybrid
plan where you do a lot of
the same shit all the time like you're
training both strength and perfect at
the same time
but i think if you uh specialize it more
you get
more long-term results so there's a lot
of power building programs out there
that people write
that are like you train the same every
week and every month
and it's always a combination of
strength and size and that's it can be
really fun
and it can give you great results but
not the best results if you're very
serious about this
you'll do a phase-potentiated approach
james yeah really good answer so
i like the old saying that the samurai
cannot serve two masters right and so in
this case you just have like a
specificity violation in terms of you're
splitting your goals across two
you know fairly distinct points and so
that's okay and i think
that that type of training is okay for
up to kind of like early intermediate
level training
and at that point when you you know
training age-wise
at that point you have to make a
decision in terms of which direction you
really want to go
if you want to start keep making
tangible progress because
i think this kind of stuff can carry you
through beginner and then into that
early to mid intermediate level and then
probably right around there you're just
not going to see your strength going up
or your muscle mass and physique
improving at the rate that you used to
see it and at some point you're going to
have to
start making more serious mrv
considerations obviously your training
resources are limited
and you want to maximize what what what
you have and
unfortunately this is not the way to do
it because you're moving in two
different paths so
i think it's okay and i think some
people do like i know chad has a power
building program and i know people have
had pretty good success on that
and again not not dr mike in my
particular cup of tea
but there are people out there who seem
to do a good job with it
i think that it's one of those i think
it's i don't want to say this
i think it's like a male ego thing right
it's like you can't make up your mind
about whether you want to be jacked or
strong or
make a face potentiated plan so you're
like i'll just try and do both to
satisfy my
my ego and that's that's okay we all
struggle with that but i just don't
think this is a good long-term plan i
think short-term it's fine i think
long-term you're gonna have to make some
hard choices
for sure all right
next up is wtf is that cream
hmm i wonder what that is referring to
all right hi docs how would you program
for the busy professional as mike
referred to them in recent exercise
selection video given they're only able
to train two to four times a week say an
average of total 150 minutes in the gym
per week
the goal is to maintain muscle and
physique possibly even gaining slowly
without going on a full-on bulk
what would your approach to nutrition be
i'm a college student who's about to
enter the workforce meaning i won't have
as much time dedicated to training
nutrition as i have before
but i want to maintain my hard-earned
gains after having taken lifting
seriously for the past three or four
years
i'm sure the situation a lot of people
find themselves in from time to time
would be interesting to hear your take
on this thanks
well that's a great question just a
couple of tips here first
you're going to be doing almost
exclusively almost exclusively compound
exercises because they save so much time
by training multiple muscle groups at
the same time
you're going to be doing you know one
arm rear lat fucking cable swings it's
like i've literally seen personal
trainers do that to like old women and
i'm like what
what are you doing why when's your
physique show coming up did the judges
tell your adults are too small
so first of all it's almost all
compounds second of all you want to pick
the compounds
that are the most general in nature so
for example a compound like wide grip
bench
is technically compound but it's almost
an isolation exercise
for your pecs it does very little three
frontal triceps but if you choose a
close-grip bench
and actually people always ask us should
i count that to chest and triceps the
answer is often both
because it stimulates the chest a whole
lot and mental headstone is actually
summarized to some of the data people
think close script benching is a chest
as a tricep exercise it's not
it's at least as much chest as triceps
but it is plenty triceps so something
like
close grip variations close grip bench
close skip underhand pull up
for example cluster up under hand pull
up can get your biceps going real well
and you're fucking bad
in addition to that what you might want
to do is do um
alternating uh antagonist supersets
uh where will you do let's say underhand
pull ups for as many reps as you can
then you lie down and you do as many
deficit push-ups as you can
with no rest or 10 seconds rest and then
you rest 30 seconds to a minute and hit
another one of those clusters
so those supersets can put a fuck load
of volume of work with you and give you
a great cardio workout
and they really economize on time
they're not the tip of the spear for
maximum physique development but that is
out of the question for you anyway
because you can't come to the gym enough
times
so i would say those are probably your
best approaches as to how to train
and i would say you train whole body
every single time you come in some of
the days of the week start with upper
body some of the days of the week start
with lower
lower body alternating so you get kind
of a little bit of a recovery adaptive
window there and then uh that's what you
do until you have more time to train
and can you go on a slow bulk uh and
gain muscle
you just have to see so what i would do
is i would just eat a little bit more
then you feel like eating
and after a few months you're gonna gain
five to ten pounds and then you're going
to
see in your body composition is that
mostly muscle and mostly fat if it's
like plenty of muscle then fuck it sweet
keep gaining or you know do a little fat
loss phase
uh get your body fat lower again and
then keep going up but if you notice
that like
it's just not enough training to really
get your game muscled and you can just
do that at maintenance until you switch
uh job styles and to one that's more
conducive a lot of times people do
have that ability to work uh do more
working out later in their careers for
example if you get right out of college
there's a bunch of jobs one one example
is finance
in which there's kind of a bit of like a
trial by fire at the beginning
uh kind of an intern phase where for a
year or two
you are working 80 to 100 hours a week
this is nothing short of bullying
that's all it is this bullying all right
so what does that call james or frat
frats do
initiation yeah initiation i own every
single
hazing yeah that's right hazing yeah
yeah i own every single
dvd of frat boy initiations from uh
pornhub studios
it's great 20 volumes god these frat
boys jeans who knows what they'll do
next and it's always so much fun
dude i saw a category today that kind of
like threw me off a little bit
well it wasn't a category it was like a
production company so there's a
this is no secret to those who have
browsed pornhub but there's like um
like you know bang like a bang bros has
like a bunch of little subsidiary
there's there's like a 4k one and
there's like name of whatever
4k so it always has like a prefix and
then ends with 4k i want to see that
ship that up close man
okay right so i was looking and i just
like happened to see one and it was like
old 4k and so in my mind that like
meant like milfy stuff right that's like
where my mind went at least right like
no fiji milty kind of stuff i was like
oh let me just see
not that at all it was old men
banging like young chicks which is gross
it was all you want to see that in 4k
i know i was like who wants to watch
this this is awful
and it's like i don't know maybe i'm
just maybe i had a comment but i was
like oh that sounds like
milf to me right like 100 i
can't wait till ai is more advanced and
it can like you got an algorithm to
render videos like
less resolution for the shit you don't
want to see but really high resolution
for the shit you do
because the girl is like 5k hd and the
guy is like a pixel you're like ah this
is great
have you seen that on the the ufc they
have that new camera i think
i think it's called like 8k or so i
honestly don't know don't don't quote me
on it but it's like
they have this like new camera where the
whatever's in the
foreground is like fucking crazy sharp
and it just blurs everything else
so they've had some like yeah watch next
time watch ufc you'll notice like
there'll be a guy in the ring and
they'll do like a really close like shot
of them like you know warming up or
whatever
and you're like wow and then you'll
notice that everything else is kind of
blurry it's just exactly what you were
talking about so they're already doing
that with sports it's cool
interesting real quick while we're on
the subject of porn i wanted to post
this as a status today but i don't want
to get any flag
or just not you know any flack i'll get
but it's maybe a lot
um i get these advertisements on youtube
a lot like all the video recommendations
will be like
master class on you know acting or
master class on this the only thing i
can ever think
was uh is one of the one of the porns i
was taking a look at once
was uh julie sky high master class anal
and for some reason that just stuck in
my head so anytime i see master class
i'm like
i'm acting and i'm like that's dumb who
wants to see that
it was like they just took the word the
term master class and just threw it
through the fucking washer and i was
like well that's all that means to me
now
what kind of anal do you have to be
doing to be at the master class
a lot of guys james it's like seven guys
i ended up i don't click on shit like
that because i
one dude has plenty enough for me man
seven dudes and one girl it's like a
nightmare instead of porn but
especially with the butt yes she's a
champ
all right um what
right so i think we answered that to a
pretty decent oh yeah the hazing thing
so basically like a lot of times in the
first two years of your career
you're going to be working in an
inordinate amount of time and you're not
going to have time for a whole lot of
other stuff but that changes
like senior account managers at a lot of
firms finance firms
they go back to working 40 50 60 hours a
week and that's entirely much more
manageable
and a lot of times later in your career
you can kind of choose how many hours to
work based on sort of how much
how much money you really want to make
so uh it's definitely cool
to have these kind of strategies in your
back pocket because you know you're in
your early 20s just getting out of
school
for the next three or four years you
might not make a whole lot of gains but
then you might be like 26 or 27 years
old find yourself with a fucking awesome
job or you can train like
six times a week and then all of a
sudden voila you get in competitive
bodybuilding or something who knows
right people do this all the time
much better than just quitting because
here's the thing james and i have seen a
lot of this from
former clients and people we've been
associated with when people are
presented with an opportunity
for work that's really lucrative and
they can't train as much a lot of them
just exercise training all together
they're just like well i couldn't train
because i was so into james and i like
james and i went through
a phd program with responsibilities of
coaching a bunch of different sports and
writing our dissertations and going to
class i know some of the crazy
shit we went through that while training
full-time james and i trained full-time
like competitive athletes
and so we have our personal level very
small
bandwidth of hearing that kind of
bullshit i'm like well i didn't have
time to train
shut the fuck up you got some time
motherfucker and you see him on
instagram like
posting uh you know from happy hour bars
every other day and you're like
yeah enough time to train chat time to
hit the fucking bar which is cool cool
personal choice
don't tell us you have didn't have time
to train you'd have priorities to train
but if you can't prioritize it just two
or three times a week and get you a lot
done
and you could just say that you can just
say like it's lower on my totem pole
right now that's nobody wants to say
that because it insults you kind of you
know
yeah so i think dr mike's answers are
really good on that the only things i
would add
would be that you might consider
training closer to failure
on average during some of your sessions
especially if you're gonna be doing like
those supersets just because like
you're probably not gonna be
accumulating enough training time per
week to really be worried about like
overreaching a ton so i would say
you know most of the time we usually
recommend progressing from like you know
four
ish ir to you know one maybe close to
zero you might start at like two and end
at zero something like that
um that's fine and then you know it says
you've been lifting seriously for
the past three to four years so you know
i don't think you're going to be milking
any more beginner gains at this point so
um although i don't disagree with what
mike said about just eating a little bit
more than maybe you want or
usually eat i don't think you're going
to gain a ton of muscle mass
on this particular type of programming
just because your training age is high
enough where you're not
if you if you were new to serious
training i'd say yeah you could do that
you'll probably gain some muscle for the
next one to two years
um you're right around that time where
you're kind of you're kind of flirting
with that
early intermediate stage so i don't
think that um trying to
gain muscle at this time is a good idea
and the reason i say that is because
if you're trying to just eat more you're
probably just going to get more fat and
then you're going to feel shitty so i
would say like mike said
maybe just wait for a more opportune
time in your life
to really get after it hard and just do
the best that you can it's
completely fine to say i have other
priorities in my life
i still want to train it's just lower
than it's just of less importance than
some other things i have going on
there's no shame in that
and that's the thing so mike if you told
mike and i that we'd be like yes
that makes sense if you're like i don't
have time to train you'd say that's a
bunch of bullshit you just don't you
just aren't prioritizing
what level of priority you choose is up
to you so that's fine so don't feel bad
about that
next up
is yoshi
y-u-s-h-y let's see
all right let's do the control f why you
ah i can't see oh i can't see
hold on what
is happening what
sorry i'm having some there we go let's
try again
why you there we go now we're working
got it
howdy doc's i cover the question that's
been on my mind
say you have a daily step goal is it
less optimal in terms of energy
expenditure and ultimately fat loss to
the majority of those steps in the
morning
a longer bout or spread the steps
throughout the day um so so we're
talking about the
finest hairs of optimality here but
generally speaking
you want to do more of your activity
earlier in the day
but not most of your activity so if you
have like
if we had a day here and i showed you
optimally how to gauge your steps
it would be like this and then you go to
sleep but like
the spread is important too so it's a
little bit slightly more optimal
to get daily activity in and have about
the same amount of steps hour to hour
hour
uh it's more optimal by a tiny little
bit because it causes less fatigue
than a distinct like you go out for an
hour and a half you get all your steps
in for the day and then you sit at your
computer for the rest of the time
tiny tiny difference but nonetheless
your
your so tldr your steps should be as
spread out as possible with a slight
bias towards a bit more activity in the
morning
a bit less in the evening james yeah i
think that's good and honestly
like mike said this is splitting the
finest a pair so frankly i think the
deciding factor should be what fits your
schedule better
like if you're trying to cram a whole
big you know
cardio session in the morning and you
find that it's really disruptive
maybe just try and be more active
throughout the day and take short little
walks in between things you got going on
at work
or even just milk out your your bathroom
breaks a little bit longer
um i would say like that's probably more
important in terms of
being able to consistently get what you
want out of it
than doing something that is maybe just
marginally more optimal but completely
disruptive so i would say
find the right balance there that's
probably more impactful
yep so like
sorry just on that note so like um mel
is doing a really good job on that with
her training stuff right now so
sometimes like
doing a a lifting session and then a
separate cardio session in the day
for her she can do it but it's just
really disruptive when she gets into a
really good workflow so she makes the
compromise of like i'm just gonna walk
for 30 minutes before my lift
is it the best way to do it no is it
going to like have a huge impact on her
also no so it's just easier for her to
implement it that way
next up is a man that has authored some
of our favorite books
daniel brown
[Music]
oops i love that one book with
what was i called james i'm not sure
actually
what are we talking about daniel brown
the fucking
i promise brown
book i think it's daniel brown
yeah uh the davinci code oh okay
i was like if you search brown book you
might get some unfortunate
unfortunate results yo dan brown has
written
so many fucking books da vinci code
inferno angels and demons origin the
lost symbol digital fortress deception
point
symphony wild symphony damn
holy fuck this motherfucker been right
in
digital fortress sounds fun that sounds
interesting i thought about like
somebody trying to siege like a
pixelated castle
you're like this book sucks let us send
fuck out of here
but it's not they're not saying it
because the uh 8-bit sound can't capture
a human voice so it's just a like a
thought bubble
all right daniel brown says hey docs
would you recommend adding cardio for
general health
during a gaming phase would you say
regular resistance training would be
enough thanks well that
depends on a couple things one is what
your step count is daily
if your step count is under 5 000 i
would add in cardio that is increase
your step count better yet i would just
increase your step count not call the
formal cardio get more activity
somewhere between 5 000 and 10 thousand
is really good anything north of ten
thousand steps is probably really good
secondarily i would monitor health and
blood work during your massing phases
and see what your health is looking like
if you finish a five month long massing
phase and your health is fucking stellar
i wouldn't worry about it at all
finish your final five month long
masking phase and you're kind of fat and
you feel like shit
and your blood markers are not that
great then i would experiment with
adding a little bit more physical
activity
i personally get an average of 10 000
steps a day
when i'm massing it lets me eat a ton
more food which is fun
uh towards the end of asking not so much
fun but it keeps me way fucking leaner
and way fucking healthier
so it is a thing but whether or not you
need it depends on what you're doing now
it's not just some general
thing like everyone needs 20 minutes
three times a week cardio blah blah
yeah totally agree with dr mike here so
mike um it's it's definitely feasible
that the resistance training that you do
for massing is
sufficient to hit your daily activity
needs for a lot of people for some
people it's not
one thing i would use as a reference
here is kind of like are you able to do
your activities of daily living
with relative ease and so that's that's
an okay marker but then the problem is
it's like for people who don't have
activities of daily living like they
just sit on the couch and don't really
do anything
then you say okay well then the step
counts become increasingly helpful
because you're just not very active at
that point
and so one thing you can start looking
at too is just like your your blood
markers and
even just like your your regular health
markers like your heart rate and blood
pressure like you might be somebody who
is
fit relatively lean like you got abs or
close to abs but like you look at your
resting heart rate and it's like a
hundred
you're like okay all right maybe i have
something going on
and like tying your shoes causes your
face to go red and you feel like you're
gonna have an aneurysm like
yeah your blood pressure might be a
little too high so then you might
consider
adding some type of cardio but usually
like if you live
and i feel like anyone who's watching
this probably knows what i mean by this
like if you have a relatively active
lifestyle meaning you're not just like
on the couch all the time
as long as you can do the things that
you generally are trying to do
throughout the day
and you're not like huffing and puffing
aside from maybe going up a long flight
of stairs um you're probably okay on the
cardio front
keep in mind like of all the times
that you could add cardio during a mass
phase is probably the
least optimal i mean it's just how it
goes
but again if health is more important
than your mass space then it's
completely appropriate so just keep that
in mind anytime you're you're
you're you're balancing muscle gain and
cardiovascular health
those sometimes more often than not will
butt heads a little
a little bit so i would say
try not to add cardio while you're
massing because it's just gonna
slowly chip away at something your gains
over time um and just go from there and
then you can always add more cardio
later too
so
there was actually somebody was it um
greg knuckles did he post something on
concurrent training lately somebody did
they did like another review there's
like a thousand reviews of concurrent
shows was it brad yeah and it seems more
now aside from like the obvious
trade-offs of like opportunity cost of
training like meaning like
if you're doing cardio training that
just means you can't do as much weight
training yeah
those are like kind of obvious and not
unique to concurrent because you could
say the same thing about sport training
or anything else right yeah
uh but then the actual kind of mechanism
seem to be increasingly clear
and it seems like the timing of where
those two activities are in relation to
each other does seem to be a
somewhat of a more impactful factor so
um
i just thought that was interesting and
that's kind of at least in terms of what
i
had come to understand those were really
the only kind of direct
conflicting mechanisms the ones in which
you would do them kind of back to back
seem to be the most clear um and that
recent evidence kind of seems to point
in that direction and
less to the kind of indirect things so i
thought it was neat
yeah you have to read that all the way
and it's especially case for more
advanced athletes so it's like something
not to like wave our own flag but we've
been saying that for four or five years
and we've gotten some pushback
occasionally and now there's no more
pushback because that's clearly just the
truth
yeah and i think sometimes too like i
was guilty of this of saying like here's
this like really extensive list of
reasons why
concurrent training has interference
effects and then like like 80
of them you could say about anything
right they're not necessarily unique
and most of them are something to the
tune of opportunity cost right
yeah all right jason
predict
[Music]
dude you might as well just see this oh
there he is
jason oh oh no there we go
get your mask off your your your your
thumbnail
get that mask off you know what
where's my mask i'm going to do this
webinar with the mask on safety first
breathing i'm breathing into the mic and
it's going to get you mike
there's been a new a new uh
comprehensive review it's just not on
masks and the overall conclusion is like
they might not do anything it's just
like whatever
that sucks it's funny because like i
think
here in montana i think they lifted the
statewide mandate which sounds
cool but then their local governments
still enforce it so like sure
you're in missoula you still have to
wear it right yeah missoula you know
missoula is a pretty left-wing
place they're going to wear masks until
like 20-55 i
just love the like the games they play
with they're like and same thing with
like tex
i remember um ufc uh was trying to get
to texas because texas the governor said
like we're open for business we can have
live events and ufc's like cool can we
have an event and they were like
no that's awesome what do you mean no i
thought you're always okay
yeah it's just all goofy like smoke and
mirrors like we're
we're open now like okay and then you
try and do something and we're like
no you can't do that for sure all right
jason asks why do i always feel so weak
during the first week of a mess up the
first week after a week-long deload
after a deload it always takes me about
7-10 days to start feeling normally
strong again so
a couple questions here for you jason to
consider in your own time
you feel weak and perform weekly or two
different things you may not feel great
but perform very admirably
first second um what may be happening is
that
you're not practicing the lifts often
enough or heavy enough during the deload
and you're sacrificing some neural
adaptations
so that you're actually showing up with
not as much practice under your belt and
some people need more frequent lift
practice to keep up the neural
adaptations and feel strong
another one is you may be under eating
on your d loads and actually not
dropping as much fatigue as you think
and also potentially losing some muscle
mass because you're under eating and not
training enough
that can result in quite a bit of
weakness there some people's diets on a
de-load
turn off and they just eat like a couple
things protein bar here and there and a
slice of pizza at night they fall asleep
and that's that
that's not gonna happen uh so well but
what i would uh i would advise
you to do is just a couple of things
first make sure your eating is very very
good on the deal
eat plenty at least as much as you feel
like you should be eating possibly a
little bit more just to make sure that's
not the case
next you should be practicing the lifts
even if it's very super lightweight
relatively often okay so
maybe to have three d load days where
you practice
the main lifts that you're worried about
feeling weak again that you're going to
be starting in the
next message cycle and then lastly what
i would say is experiment with two
mesocycles or
more than two of two different kinds of
dilute strategies one deal with
strategies you reduce the volume quite a
bit but you keep the intensity
relatively high the entire time
so that load on the bar stays pretty
heavy you do fewer reps and fewer sets
but
so it's definitely simply less but you
just kind of go heavy all up until maybe
the last third of the deload when you go
light or just skip and just come back
the other strategy uh you can try is
instead of deloading
just take the entire week off and if you
come back really strong after a week off
of good eating
then you are holding too much fatigue if
you come back much stronger after a week
of much harder training still deload but
much harder and heavier
and you're much stronger then it turns
out you probably just weren't losing too
much fitness
and you have to try both to see which
one it is because it's unlikely to be
both at the same time
it's probably too much of one or two
much of the other uh because any time
you under train you usually draw fatigue
like crazy
the nutrition one will fuck both of
those in the ass and so we'll sleep
things like that but we're gonna be
assuming that at least going forward
you're gonna do a good job on all those
james
yeah so we were we were on the same
wavelength here so
usually the first culprit is to figure
out if you're deloading too hard or too
easy meaning like you took too much
time off like you went for too long and
you actually started deconditioning or
you didn't actually get enough
recuperative effect from your dealer
that's usually kind of the first step is
like
is the what i'm doing and the timelines
that i'm time
lines that i'm using correct and getting
me what i want
another thing that just popped into my
head and i think dr mike and i are
always
assuming that you're you're doing the
same thing or
close to the same thing in the next meso
a lot of times people will do
completely new exercise swaps after the
deload
and then they feel weak in the
subsequent mesocycle and that's just
because you added the novelty of the new
movement and you're just kind of
recalibrating
for whatever it is that you're doing the
reason why that comes up a lot
and i think sometimes we just assume
that we're on the same page so
that's one thing you also have to factor
in so if you did like back squats
on this one and you deloaded and then
the next message you're doing front
squats you're like man these front
squats feel like shit yeah no kidding
because you haven't done them for a
little while and that's a completely
normal thing to do so i would say
when you're trying to make that
comparison don't do apples to oranges
make sure it's apples to apples like if
you're looking at squats for five to ten
the next one should also be squats five
to ten or damn near close to that
and then you can start figuring out like
should i use the strategies that mike
already outlined in his talk on um
making sure that my d load is
appropriately scaled either not too hard
or not too easy
it's like it's remember i was just
thinking like back in the day like um
like i know you don't do this anymore
but like i know you and i we
we do like low bar squat right after for
at one point and we'd be like man this
yeah you throw it in and you're like
what the hell this low bar squat feels
terrible it's like yeah
of course it feels terrible you haven't
done it for like six months you know
and then you do it do it to it it feels
way better yep exactly
yeah good call all right
next up is airy small
aerie let's see
okay i'm gonna search for it
got him oh a couple multiple posts yeah
it's the one that says when progressing
got it when progressing through a
mesocycle if you reach what you thought
would be your final week
when you're pushing to zero one rir but
you have not reached mrv
what do you do do you continue zero one
rar each week until you hit mrv well so
that's actually a good question there's
two distinct answers one
so the only answers depend on if you
have a a predetermined
muscle cycle length or an autoregulated
motorcycle length if it's auto regulated
if you're not competing in anything
everything's fine the rest of your
body's fine just keep going
and add more volume and next week and
just go to failure again
sooner or later you'll hit your mrv and
that'll be that and then you can sort of
learn from it and
program better next time but uh if it's
a
dedicated accumulation to do a paradigm
especially if maybe locally your rv
hasn't been hit but systemically your
fatigue is starting to get pretty high
then just deload but just learn for next
time that you could have been doing more
volume and benefiting so
those are the two options i see yeah and
that's a really great point because some
people
um are really hard-nosed on the
pre-planned stuff and they're like nope
i'm not gonna deviate and there's
there's definitely some merit to that in
terms of consistency and reliability of
your outcomes
but if you're open to auto regulating
there's no reason why you can't just
keep going until you can't really go
anymore i saw this this question
reminded me of a really great
meme that i saw i don't know if it was
the reps and reserve guy or who did it
but it was the the swole dog and teams
you know what i mean the like the big
sheba and the little sheba you know what
i'm talking about
and it was like the big sheba was like
bodybuilders in the 70s and 80s like
just finished my six hour workout and
i'm on my eighth steak
and then the little dog teams was like i
accidentally hit one rr this week coach
can i deload please
that's awesome i was like you gotta ask
for deloads that's so true
um yeah so um i think either one's fine
like you can so on the one hand if you
just want to keep to your schedule
because
you have like a really rigid schedule
and you want to maintain it that's fine
you can adjust your next mesocycle
accordingly and say okay i didn't really
hit mrv
on this one i'm still going to deal it
i'm still going to start as normal but i
might either
progress more aggressively or i might
shift my what i thought was my mev and
mrv values up just a little bit
um or what i think is probably the
better method in both the short and long
term is just go ahead and take another
week at you know
like zero to one see where you get and
then do the same thing and then just
just feed back and feed forward and say
like okay well this is what happened
here's where i ended
i'm gonna plan my next meso accordingly
and you you end up doing kind of the
same thing anyway
andrew atkinson hmm
actually it's atkisson
weird i've been saying his name wrong
this whole time
maybe he misspelled his own name there
we go let's see that's why
hi docs if in my last mesocycle some
muscle groups
had not hit mrv but most others had
and i decided to deload due to systemic
fatigue what your suggestions be for the
volume at the beginning
of the next mesocycle
so real quick i i read this question and
i was proved when i was writing down
which questions we answered i read the
first part of this question was
instantly came to me
you begin a mesocycle with the volume
that checks the boxes for making
a good stimulus but not going overboard
has absolutely
nothing to do with how you end the
mesocycle
at all how you end the mesocycle is a
result of how many volume jumps you take
and adaptation and fatigue and all this
other stuff
so at the beginning of your next
mesocycle you start at whatever is
auto-regulatory the place you should
start so for example you come in
you do a few sets when you get a decent
pump you stop
you leave that's it that's it and
there's no way that's ever going to be
different
because if you start at a higher level
you're actually starting above your
minimum effect of volume
just to get to your mrv why what is so
great over at your mrv that you want so
much
that being said he does
suggest that was such a memeable quote
oh my god
which one like what's over at your mrv
that you want so much
right like doctor that's like i i'm
seeing that fucking meme just like all
there you go name it up james and i'll
link me and i'll just stop
somebody's looking at that meme with dr
mike saying that going like
what he's not the guy what are you doing
like we never said um
he was the goal we said it's a really
good way to know that you've done all
you can but you're not just trying to
run to it and
throwing everything aside you mentioned
you go to mrv your first week so then he
says start slightly higher so
as i get closer reach out marvin no and
he says or progress volume quicker
through the meso
uh provided i recover fine also no
historically that that already is proven
to be not true right so
right so right so
progressing through volume should be
done only in an auto regulated manner
do you get no longer such great pumps or
no longer such amazing soreness and so
on and so forth if yes then that's up
sometimes some muscles just have this
amazing ability
to recover really well more than others
and then you'll hit mrv with those
muscles
never and the others will hit mrv here's
what you can do
you can have specialization phases where
you drop the other muscles to the back
burner
so they no longer systemically stop you
from really milking up these
other muscles in addition to that you
can have a situation
where you push these muscles a little
bit harder than you normally would
knowing they can take it that has its
downsides though because if you're
already getting great training great
gains
i wouldn't artificially boost anything
to just train more remember there's
a u-shaped curve ish and there's there's
the other side of that use as you get
really closer to mrv it's not really
clear that you're getting these enormous
benefits
if you never get there you're sure
you're under training but if you're
getting
great amazing training and great
progress and you're never getting to mrv
i wouldn't really worry about it
right so i wouldn't necessarily progress
quicker you could progress a little bit
quicker so not a little bit quicker
let me make this very very particular if
you ever have about those muscles that
tend to never hit mrv
if you have a doubt of saying ooh i feel
like i can recover from another set but
maybe i think i can do two well for
those muscles fuck it too you know it's
too easy you're done like you're not
it's not a problem
so every time you have a decision to
make it could be a little bit less or a
little more for those muscles feel free
to pile it on now don't proactively try
to pile it on
still autoregulatory but just be a
little bit more brazen with your
decisions
whereas if it's like you're hamstring
super low on rv can i recover from two
cents now i don't have two fucking sets
i've added half a set of hamstrings
before james
that's where i'm at where my recovery
where like i'll do my rep sets where
like it's
two sets of 20 hamstrings the first set
of straight set 20 the second set of 20
is like
get up to 14 then a couple reps then a
couple reps and you're so too many sets
the third set if i add a set is just 10.
it's just one set of 10.
i don't go another set of 20 because
it's just like way too much and it's
like
five maya rep sets within it i would
just never recover i've tried that i was
like that was fucking stupid so
i yeah so i would just do that
and another option is this is tough when
systemic fatigue is high but if you have
local muscles
hitting mrv like you're saying the quads
hit mrv and it's only three weeks in but
your biceps nowhere closed
you can take a recovery half week for
your quads
and reboost them and get another good
couple weeks of training out them while
your biceps you train hard that entire
time
and then both quads and biceps can reach
mr v at the same time at the end
together whereas quads already hit
almost mr view once and you deloaded
really quick
and gave them some some fresh life so
those are some options for you
just make sure that auto regulation at
the end of the day is what's determining
your volume and not like to sort of like
run towards mrv as fast as possible
yeah that was a really really thorough
answer the only thing i would add here
andrew is
um kind of going in a slightly different
direction than when dr mike said what
you could also look at is what are the
exercises
that are causing all that systemic
fatigue and then you can try and start
looking into
more high sfr options because it sounds
like you're having the classic
intermediate conundrum the systemic
fatigue is preventing me from hitting
the mrvs of the things that i want to
hit mrv on right
and that's usually because there's a
couple like nasty uh instigators in
there and it might be a squat or a
deadlift or
whatever and you're gonna have to start
piecemealing those out and figuring out
okay which of these exercises
are maybe no longer as appropriate for
me because of the systemic
and fatigue cost and the spillover into
other muscle groups
and there's nothing wrong with that that
is like the intermediate conundrum all
of us have had to go there
i can tell you for a fact like i've i
started uh making a lot of those changes
in my uh training because
i noticed like if i do heavy squats or
heavy deads it wipes me out
what did i start doing recently i got a
sissy squat little bench
oh my god i used to do the like knees
forward sissy squats and those were for
me those were pretty good so i was like
i'll try these like bench
sissy squats jesus christ those blow me
the fuck right up
right which is incredible i'll do
pre-fatigue sissy squat and then i'll do
a couple sets of what
you know what is heavy but it's not
actually heavy because i have to take
the weight down of some barbell squats
holy crap do my quads get sore when
before just doing really heavy squats
wouldn't really make me all that sore it
would just make me fucking exhausted all
the time right
so then you can see in that case like
it's not right or wrong it's just one of
those things where you say like
this historically was a good movement
for me now that i'm like bigger stronger
or just more trained
i can't use it the way i used to use it
because it has such a spillover effect
on everything else
so for whatever it is maybe it's i'm
using legs because that's the big
usual the common culprit but it might be
something where like
overhead pressing barbell pressing bent
rows maybe that's what's just wiping you
out and the way that you kind of figure
that out is
when you're approaching your peak weeks
you know that there are some exercises
that you're kind of dreading and having
anxiety over you know that like man this
is gonna be a shit show those that's the
one right that's the one where you're
like when you're
you're sitting there about to go to the
gym and you're like oh man
today's gonna be rough that's the one
figure and then you can go from there
and say okay
is there something better i can choose
that doesn't seem to have the systemic
spillover
and then you start getting a really nice
tidy group of exercises for all of your
muscles
and systemic fatigue doesn't as often
become a limiting factor and this is
just classic
intermediate conundrum so play around
with it this is like a fun thing for you
at this point in your training age to
figure out
boom
next up charles austin
charles austin sounds like he should be
winning an award for something
yeah it would be like a british
horseback rider royal family
got it charles austin says in
renaissance diet you seem to be against
bulking for longer than six months
that's mostly because we don't think
people can train hard sequentially for
six months without a break by the way
um at the end of the six months went
from 145 to 157 and still have visible
abs
what do you docs think about a month or
two a month is long enough by the way
of maintenance to lower some nagging
joint pain and general fatigue i would
say
two weeks of that and two weeks of
active rest would be best
followed by another bulk i think that's
a great idea i also wouldn't consider
myself a beginner i've been lifting for
over three years and at 145 i was
shredded
so that sounds really good yeah if you
don't uh if you still have visible abs
and
you don't feel like and you feel like
you have
important point a lot of runway left to
gain more weight before you become
dissatisfied with your physique then you
can continue what i don't want you to do
is you still have sort of technically
visible abs
you kind of know in the back of your
mind that if you mask for another three
or four weeks you're going to have no
longer very crisp abs and you're going
to be like i need to cut
don't mask for a month and then cut
that's fucking stupid so what i would
say is
uh i would my my most conservative
recommendation which the one i think
that would
be more appropriate for most people is
what i would do is i would take like a
month
or just two weeks of active rest a month
or two weeks of low volume training two
weeks of active rest or just two weeks
of active rest
after that i would take um uh
four to six weeks of mini cutting uh in
which you significantly reduce your body
fat percentage
and then i would start messing again
because you know at the end of
at the bottom there's no downside to
that really except for the fact that you
you know give yourself more runway so
basically like say four to six weeks
in six weeks of mini cutting let's say
you burn eight pounds of fat
which is very reasonable that's eight
pounds of fat
you can have that window of to regain
while gaining new muscle and then you'll
end up at the same condition you are now
months and months and months later with
a shitload of muscle and eight pounds
more fat
so that is something i would recommend
because
because you went through six months of
bulking that's really good
there's nothing a mini cut's really
going to hurt other than taking away
four to six weeks of your time
and in the grand scheme six months of
massing versus four or six weeks of mini
cutting
it's just not that high price to pay
because what i don't want you to do is
to get two three even four months in
have great momentum on your lips be
getting tons of strength and then be in
a position where you are not really
liking your body unless your esteem
about lifting
starts to decline and you start cutting
you interrupt your momentum
right after maintenance phase there is
no momentum so just do a mini cut and
then you'll fucking skyrocket right out
of that go into mass
and that's like some real world
experience right there because dr mike
and myself and countless other people we
know
all did that where we just bulked for
too long and then later we were like oh
now i'm so
fat and i feel like shit and i look like
shit and then you just get into this
like shitty loop of like
not having as productive of training as
you can and not feeling good about the
training that you are doing which is
generally going really well right and
that's the thing where you're just like
things are going good and you feel bad
about it because your physique is not
quite where you want to be
and then you get into this like fat
phobic stuff and blah blah been there
done that not great so i think the mini
cut option is really good helps keep you
nice and lean
and then uh you're still clearly seems
like you're still making progress
i would keep going on the mass wagon um
to the point where you feel comfortable
usually i mean like
six months is a pretty long time to be
massing but if you
if you've noticed that your lifts are
significantly been going up in rep
strength or you've been adding a lot of
weight onto the bar for as you've been
going from 145 to 157
man hard to argue with that heart you
won't hear an argument from from mike
and i saying you gained weight
and either there's more weight on the
bar or more reps being performed you're
you're making progress one way or
another so i think that you probably
still have some more in you but i think
the mini cut is a really good option i
would definitely go with that
the another thing you could do is just
cap it off right there
and just kind of see how you feel for a
little while maybe just do a maintenance
phase and just be like you know i'm
actually pretty like
pretty stoked on how i look right now
and maybe i'm just going to ride this
out for a little bit that's also fine
it just depends on like what your
long-term goals are going to be so if
you're somebody who is
wanting to make like really substantial
progress over the next few years
you probably want to get on with the
next phase whether that's a cut mini cut
or
you know continuing on with bulking but
if you're not one of those people and
you just want to like feel good and
have a good beach body for the summer
then just cruise where you are and
show off a little bit that's totally
fine too
last up our 11th question
is vasil gelev
man you know i can't spell that
v-a-s-i-l
[Music]
got it he says hey dr mike
are you willing to jump on a podcast
such as revive stronger to clear the air
for the ones who are confused such as
myself with the whole failure thing
concerning lyle
i like you and rp of course and this is
not meant to trigger
you i am not triggerable by the way or
open a can of worms
sorry if i am it's for i know how to
trigger doctor mike but that's usually
an off-camera thing
very off camera
[Laughter]
um it's for the culture
lyle mcdonald has watched some of our
training videos
and has concluded that because there is
not as much of a loss
in repetition speed towards the end
as he would like to see as he thinks is
related to failure proximity that we are
very far away from failure and that
concomitantly makes us
less tough a couple of things wrong with
that
first of all lyle is talking about
concentric failure not technical failure
technical failures when you know your
next rep in order to be done
will have to be done improperly like
you'll have to scoot your butt off of
the leg curl machine in order to make it
happen
lyle made a video which i haven't seen
because i don't watch videos of lyle
mcdonald other than the one where he's
uh seducing his dog
um you guys can check that one out
menage it's called menage a dog
if it's on the internet lyle didn't post
it somebody mapped it off of his shit
it's hilarious because loud is fucking
weird
so other than that video i've never
really seen any of his videos but i've
i was told that his demonstration of
like leg curling
uh true failure has him moving all
around the pad and he had reached
technical failure many many reps before
that
so first that's something he doesn't
seem to comprehend or
want to comprehend very delilah's a bad
faith actor he's not intending to get to
the truth he's intending to try to
embarrass and insult
so it's very difficult to see what he
actually believes um
like it used to be sorry just on that
point because i think that's an
interesting
point that you brought up because i
think like you and i just historically
are very are sticklers on technique and
we we carry that into our work and so we
tend to write about and talk about these
things with like a very hard line
on technique and i i don't think other
people maybe share that same
value and that's okay you don't have to
but like so whenever you read any of the
rp stuff on training
you probably have seen us beat it to
death that we
technical failure is included in that
and so for other people um
it's just not as big of a concern as
putting in like the rel there's the raw
effort
which i think is which is fine i'm not
saying i of course i'm biased to
thinking that our way
is better or at least more productive in
the long term at reducing injury risk
and probably not
not much worse uh in terms of efforts
um but i can see why somebody would look
at that and say like
yeah well they didn't go to true failure
well it's like you're not you're not
supposed to go to truth failure because
true failure is how you get hurt and
fucked up dummy
yeah and so that's our baseline so just
to put it just to make a
sorry to rant here but i think that's
interesting because um
as rp goes we're gonna be sticklers on
technique and
we'll always will be and that's just our
prerogative other people
maybe not and i think that's where maybe
there's like a little disconnect there
yeah um sorry to cut you off it's just i
just i don't know
yeah yeah that's that's totally valid so
that's that's one concern is the
technical failure absolute failure
discrepancy
another concern is so at the end of the
day when we're going close to failure in
our videos
it's not it's it's uh we're going close
to the point where we think in our heads
another rep will result in very poor
technique or significantly alter
technique
sometimes it's hard to tell externally
when that happens but unless it happens
another thing is we're all much more
fast twitch than lyle because
we actually have the genetics to grow
muscle unlike him and that is meant as
an insult because i don't like lyle and
i want him to feel ashamed of himself
and to hate himself
because he's a hateful person by the way
i didn't start this fight i'm just
finishing it really well
lyle has been mean to a point that's not
a joke to every single fitness
professional
on the internet that was around five
years ago to the point where he said a
deeply deeply personal things about
people's spouses about people's
girlfriends boyfriends
it's one of those things too where like
we all make mistakes when we slip up and
maybe say something we weren't supposed
to right and it happens and as long as
you like own up to it
you apologize and subsequently change
whatever behavior or whatever it is that
you were doing just
to no longer do that that's like a
genuine apology right you say like i
fucked up
i'm going to change my ways because and
you do and you follow through with it
he does the thing where he lashes out
makes an apology and blames it on mental
illness and then just
doesn't have a diagnosis of and then it
just rinses and repeats and just keeps
doing the same shit so it's kind of like
you get like an insincere apology and
you see the same repeated behavior and
that's where you just know you're
dealing with somebody who is 100
either bad unstable or both yeah and
it's all in bad faith
so you know i'm i i've you know uh
debate anyone who comes at me with good
faith i debate in good faith
i've debated uh jordan peters and
absolutely good faith you can look at
that stuff
uh i've had also i even had a good faith
discussion with lyle when i thought he
was acting good faith on the
brad schoenfeld study and that turned
out not to be true and so i just had
enough of that shit
um you know greg dussett that wasn't bad
faith so i gave it back to him like i
saw he was giving it to mean
as fanboys thought i was too mean to him
you poor greggy
um but in any case so the live thing
lastly is
that uh he doesn't think that we're
going close enough to failure he may
have a point maybe we're not
but my contract for that would be close
enough for what uh hypertrophic stimulus
is a the the literature that was my
that's what i was thinking like
sure what so what's your point like it
seems like they're doing just fine
right first of all but it could all be
drugs of course it's all drugs with lyle
even though
lyle himself uses drugs he's just a
fucking liar lyle has used anabolics i
know that for almost
almost a fact and he's also used dmp
multiple times so he's a
he's a worse kind of fucking hypocrite
liar but in any case he's
just the world's worst fucking dog shit
generics for lifting which i don't harp
on him because you know fucking shit
sucks shit happens right
so maybe charlie and i and jared are
getting to buy on a shitload of drugs
and good genetics
but if you look at the actual data which
allows seems to be a fan of when it's
convenient
the hypothesis that very close to
failure training is
incredibly more beneficial to muscle
gain it's just not in evidence it's just
not an evidence okay you can train three
or four reps away from failure all the
time and be just about as big as anybody
else
so i think we're probably getting three
or four reps away from the technical
failure we're having a high degree of
effort
and and so far i have not seen my
results decline or inability
to make gains because i'm not going
close to failure furthermore in my own
training
i've experimented many many times often
for years but going much much closer to
failure going beyond failure
i did not see any increase in results
and often a decrease in results
so lyle's argument about what he sees in
the training videos
is in bad faith doesn't understand the
complexities and background of what
technical failure is to make even make a
decent point
and uh no one's having a problem no one
asked for his advice
so i'll go fuck himself it's just funny
and verdi this i'm not we don't need to
beat the horse dead but it's just one of
those funny things where it's like
what is your point so like even if they
are oh
their their rir calculation is off for
whatever reason like i
you can document the progress over time
that you've been making
you know what i mean so it's like
with your point while it would be like a
hilarious epiphany where it's like oh
you can actually train
five rir and make huge gains when you're
on drugs drugs are amazing right like
let's go ahead you don't have to train
that close to me yeah tell everyone else
on drugs to stop training a failure and
endangering themselves so it's like what
are you trying to get out of the
what are you trying to get out of it
she's just trying to
um like it's just like a smear campaign
which is like hilariously misplaced
like yeah also just just real quick um
it seems that everything everything he
says about this comes from this
perspective or we're not tough
like that's that's the real just i'm
getting of it he's like you don't know
how to trade failure he goes
come come through come over and i'll
show you how to train to true failure
i think it's like a wrestling coach kind
of mentality of like you don't know what
hard is
like lyle nobody believes you're tough
nor will they ever
and also in every category of human
behavior i'm tougher than you
i can drink closer to failure than you i
can do it for longer i have more
willpower than
you i'm just better than you lyle in
almost every way you can measure except
for probably weird masturbation habits
and prolific will play video games
you started this lyle you made fun of me
first
in a way that was in bad faith and
actually tried to hurt my feelings the
only reason i'm saying this is i'm just
mirroring it back to you so anytime you
want to be nice
you can be nice to you again lyle but if
you want to keep being a cunt i'm
funnier than you
i'm smarter than you and i'm better at
being encountered you oh man all right
folks before we
shoot ourselves in the foot we're going
to sign off on this one uh quick update
on rp things
i submitted the audiobook stuff
including the supplemental pdf
for the hypertrophy book so it's kind of
it's kind of hit or miss so you never
know
with them sometimes it goes through
smoothly and sometimes you work on it
for like six months i don't know we'll
see but
that's uh going and then the next one in
the works on that will be
uh dr mel's habit book once we get uh
that's set up for
paperback and audio and then i
have finished the edits i got from
ashley and some of our other staff
members on the book that i'm working on
and i've sent my
chapters off to mel so she's going to
start editing the book that i'm working
on and so that's in the pipeline and the
hopefully in the near future dr mike
what do you got going on
but also good i'm only exclusively
working on secret projects now so
stay tuned not too tuned because some of
them are a few months away
we have good things coming but uh video
recording for youtube we're months and
months out of schedule
so expect multiple uh uh me too
it's awful multiple videos incoming
about really cool stuff as a matter of
fact i think this next month
are going to be some less boring and
slightly more entertaining videos uh
that's not every month because we record
way in advance and sometimes you just
get some boring months of just pure
learning
but i don't feel like most of people
tune into this channel just kind of want
to learn and
have enough because you know like look
i'm not the best entertainer neither are
you james no offense um
like some people just like you know the
more plates more dates guy he's really
funny he's got a ton of views but like
you know some of that stuff's pretty
informative but like it's
it's really just like he's a funny guy
and he has a lot of great insights and
people are just there for him you know
what i mean like greg just said all
these other guys
like uh for us i think a lot of people
you know like i'm not that funny and i'm
not
not that interesting i think more people
come to just learn shit from us
and so even if it's boring i think very
few people are like we used to have some
complaints at the beginning of the
channel like oh this is boring but
nowadays almost everyone's like this is
great it's like a
one-hour lecture for free so more people
like that and we've got what you guys
need sometimes it'll be more fun
sometimes it's just learning but that's
why you're here absolutely all right on
that note
folks we're going to sign off again make
sure you subscribe to the youtube
channel and keep sending in those
excellent questions we really have a
good time answering them and it helps
keep us sharp so thanks again for
engaging with us and we will talk to you
next time peace
