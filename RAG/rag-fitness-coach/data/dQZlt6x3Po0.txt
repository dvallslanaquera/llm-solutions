one place to look may be hilariously not
even on the upper chest at all I feel
like a shitty marketing scammer are your
feet in a position that allows for a lot
of stability a not so wise idea would be
to load up the dumbbell press and keep
your feet dangling when the movement
gets difficult you start to wobble back
and forth and that is terrible but why
wouldn't you wobble you're totally
unstable the best thing you can do is
put your feet down whole foot into the
ground connected to the ground butt
connected to the chair upper back
connected to the bench and now you are
fucking Unstoppable fright train of
stability and strength amazing if you're
a short King like me it's totally fine
to just put your toes in as long as you
feel
stable
