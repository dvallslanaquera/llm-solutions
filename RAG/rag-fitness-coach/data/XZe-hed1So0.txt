[Music]
welcome everyone to the rp strength
podcast i am nick shaw
and today i am flying solo
without lori she has to attend to
something and we'll be getting into that
on a
future episode but have no fear we have
on
our first ever rockstar guest
and i mean that literally so we have
nina strauss who is a female guitarist
in lead for alice cooper and was
recently ranked number one on guitar
world's list of
10 female guitar players you should know
very cool nita welcome to the rp podcast
thank you so much nick i appreciate you
having me on i'm excited to
chat about some fun fitness stuff with
you guys
yeah totally so i know people must be
wondering you are a rock star what is
that like to
literally be called a rock star well i
play guitar for a rock star
that i think is probably more accurate i
get to live a fun kind of rock star life
but
uh i'm lucky enough to stand on stage
with the real rock star with dallas
cooper and
really just be like a support rock star
if you will
yeah yeah that's very cool and so
can you just go into your background a
little bit cause i'm just curious as to
you know how does one get into that and
how do you kind of stumble upon that
really cool journey i know there's got
to be a great backstory there
yeah so my background believe it or not
is actually in fitness
um i have been doing ballet and
gymnastics from the time that i could
walk
and i grew up in competitive sports i
was doing rhythmic gymnastics
and i got up to the junior olympic
qualifiers
in rhythmic gymnastics which is really
exciting so i was traveling around the
world
already at a really young age competing
and performing and doing all that
and then i picked up the guitar at age
13 and that just blew my mind
uh and so in that literally like in that
moment i
completely switched trajectories on my
life i was positive that i was going to
be
you know a gymnast and then go to the
olympics and then be a coach
and spend my life in that world you know
who what 12 year old has their life
figured out
and then i did a total pivot and i fell
into music and fell in love with music
so i started playing guitar at 13 i did
my first national tour
two years later at 15. uh i dropped out
of high school after my sophomore year
to pursue music full-time
and uh now in 33 i've been touring
professionally for
uh 18 years which seems really long
when i say it out loud um so yeah from
the time i was 15
uh until now and uh along the way i've
had a chance to play with some pretty
cool artists and make some solo music as
well
yeah that's got to be wild i mean 18
years so what
if you're what's it like as a 15 year
old doing that i mean is that super
nerve-wracking
um it wasn't at the time looking back at
it now i think i might not let my 15
year old go on tour by himself
um you know if i was to have a 15 year
old someday
um but at the time i mean i was just a
kid following my dream
and the band that i was playing in you
know my local band from here in la
we did a series of battle of the bands
and we got to play on the van's warp
tour so it was really just this
opportunity that
when opportunity knocks you have to grab
it you have to just go for it and not
really think about well
is this safe is this dangerous sometimes
you just have to say this is what i want
with all my heart i'm just going to get
it
that sounds i mean that's spot on that's
really cool
and it's relatable to a lot of different
fields i think i mean
especially in fitness right so were you
like that it sounds like you were that
hardcore into gymnastics first and then
you sort of switched but were you
you were just like i love gymnastics
let's just go go go i want to compete
was it the same type of mindset
absolutely it was it was exactly the
same and i think competitive sports
you know not being a parent maybe i
shouldn't speak to this but i feel
really strongly at least in my case that
competitive sports are so good for kids
because
i remember my first competition you know
i would spend like
you know seven or eight or something and
you know i had worked so hard in the gym
for a couple years and finally you know
we went into this competition
and i won every category i had no idea
what to expect just thinking a little
kid i went out there i tried my hardest
i practiced hard i did my best
and i swept the whole thing all all five
gold medals in every category in the
overall
and i remember like i felt so good it
was like you know my parents are so
proud my coach is so proud and
i got done with you know with that
competition and and i kind of
slacked off and it's funny telling a
story about like a kid but
it'll make sense when i get to the end
so i slacked off a little bit in the gym
and i wasn't as motivated so i was like
i got this and then i went to the next
competition
and i didn't meddle at all i got zero
places you know not maybe dead last but
i didn't get anything and you know i got
done with you know we got done with the
ceremony and i went back to my coach in
tears and i said
you know why did i win anything she said
because you didn't work as hard
and in that moment that was when it
clicked
at you know such as such a young age
that oh
okay so what you put in directly
correlates
to what you get up and the harder you're
willing to work
the more likely it is that that work
will be rewarded that you pay off
and i was like okay so i was able to
really kind of take that mindset and
that mentality
and move that over to music
yeah that nails a spot on how old were
you when you had that sort of
revelation ah must have been seven or
eight
young whoa so that's really interesting
because i have an eight-year-old son and
i kind of
i'm trying to teach him that and i'm i
think he maybe is picking up on it but
i'm not a hundred percent sure
um because sometimes it just takes
winning and then losing
yeah i can't imagine you know sort of
thinking that
at that young of an age because i had a
similar
realization but i was more like 15 or 16
and i was in
into sports and running when i realized
that so
i can't even imagine at seven or eight
that's so cool to hear
it might have been eight or nine but
yeah it was really young definitely
younger than ten because i competed for
another several years after that
before uh my retirement at the age of
thirteen
the good old age of 13 to retire the
good old glory days
yeah that's that's really cool and so
when you got really going into guitar
then when you were like 15
did you keep up with fitness at all or
did you kind of just push that to the
side
it fell completely by the wayside for
many many years and i think it was just
this
excitement of you know knowing
once again sort of reinventing what i
thought i wanted to do with my life and
what did end up becoming what i did with
my life and it just consumed
every fiber of my being you know so i
was that kid that
you know i brought a guitar to school i
would play for the 10 minutes in between
classes
i would you know when when we got out of
school and got home i play guitar and
you know
my mom would have to tell me to put the
guitar away it's time to do homework put
the guitar down it's time to
you know come to have dinner and at
night when she said okay put the guitar
down it's time to go to bed then
i would play in the dark after she was
you know after the lights were out just
because i just
i loved playing i had that desire to
learn and get better
yeah that's really awesome and i mean so
were your parents like pretty supportive
then of of you wanting to go that route
and sort of eventually then going on
tour i'm just kind of curious as to how
that works
super super supportive so i have a
musician
dad and a dance teacher mom so they were
very happy with both my career choices
yeah that's
i mean that's really cool because i was
thinking in my head i'm in
what you had said as well sort of
building off that well man it's
it's got to be hard to imagine a
teenager going out on tour but your
parents
you know being so supportive that's got
to just be like the best feeling in the
world
oh totally you know my dad my dad was a
musician
you know a professional touring musician
for many years
my mom was a model and a dancer and
dance teacher that married a musician so
they both
kind of got the lifestyle they know what
it was all about and
uh very very supportive from day one
that's awesome so in and now this is
probably a little bit
more uh a now question but when you're
on tour
what's that like in terms of because i
know you gave up fitness for a little
bit
when you were early on but now it's much
more a part of your life so how do you
navigate being on tour being on the road
all the time
with you know trying to eat healthy or
trying to work out
i know people are probably just dying to
hear that because i know i am
it's challenging and and you as as you
know you work with so many different
people in different lifestyles you must
see
the craziest schedules much crazier than
mine um
but definitely the first thing i think
is
getting that mentality that you're not
on vacation when you're traveling
because i think it's so easy to just go
well i'm on the road i'm in a different
city every day
it's hard to eat healthy it's easier to
eat whatever's around and of course
on a tour bus whatever's around is pizza
and beer
so you have to like already get that out
of your mentality like if you wouldn't
eat it at home in your own house then
don't eat it on the tour bus
um so i really started focusing on my
fitness when i got sober in 2015
and i thought okay well i'm gonna do
something with this rather than just not
drinking being
bummed out all the time i'm gonna make
something out of this opportunity
and uh i'm gonna get myself in shape i'm
gonna get in the best shape that i can
and at this point you know in 2015 i had
already been playing with alice for a
year
i had been you know getting myself back
in shape a little bit but i was way more
focused on sort of like
the rock and roll lifestyle partying and
having fun and
you know eating pizza eating all the
pizza and drinking all the beer and not
really worrying too much about
like my physical shape and when i
started getting into fitness the first
thing that i noticed was how different
my stage performance got i had always
been a really high energy performer
but now you know with you know doing box
jumps doing more explosive movements in
the gym getting my legs stronger
on fueling my body properly with the
right macros
i was able to perform at such a higher
level that
it just it was mind-blowing so that was
that was awesome
i wish i could get that feeling back
because that was really really cool
um and then the next thing i guess would
be
just um find a routine like find things
that work for you and stick to them like
you know for example
i follow my rp template i get my
trifecta food delivered
to wherever i am on tour every friday
you know so i've got my i've got what
i'm supposed to eat then i've got the
food to eat
um and then i've got you know a workout
routine that i can pretty much do
anywhere
you know i have something designed that
i can do it with dumbbells or body
weight because hotel gyms are
they've come a long way but they're not
perfect yet for the most part
so a routine that you can do you know i
travel with like a trx and
resistance bands and a set of power
block dumbbells so if all else
fails i can do my workout wherever and
then just putting yourself
on the schedule the same way you would
at home you wake up you drink your shake
you work out you know then you go about
your day
just like you would at home yeah totally
in so i'm glad that you mentioned all
that too because i was going to say like
what do you do
when because all hotel gyms are
different even if it's a decently
equipped one it's still not very good
because
a lot of times they don't even have
barbells they don't have
you name it i mean maybe you're lucky
you can get a few
dumbbells or something like that but if
you're taking your own i mean you're
you're locked and loaded you're ready to
go oh totally you i mean and you're
you're really right and a lot of the
hotel gyms like they're they really are
getting better and better i think
as fitness is becoming more part of our
culture
but sometimes you get to the hotel gym
you start walking down the hall
and if the hotel gym has a room number
you know you're in trouble
yeah i get like oh it's in 310 this is
bad
sure enough it's just a hotel room with
an elliptical in it
totally oh yeah that's the worst because
it's like you can't really even lift and
i mean you can only do so much
bodyweight stuff but if i mean if you're
taking it with you you're pretty much
good to go
and i mean so like with trifecta that
just goes right to your hotel
too right exactly depends where we are
sometimes i'll have it sent to the hotel
sometimes if there's no hotel that day
i'll have a sense of the
um so a lot of people don't know this
but we can actually receive packages on
tour
so if i know i'm going to be playing at
the hollywood bowl
let's say where we're supposed to play
next week um
i can just have trifecta send it you
know care of the production company
and they can send it to hollywood and be
taken care of and then just get to me
when i get there
boom i mean right there you got it set
that's pretty easy
super easy much easier to stick on track
so like if someone didn't have trifecta
on on the road on tour i mean what
what's it like
is kind of a you know a normal person
what do they eat i mean you mentioned
pizza of course but
sorry i was just going to say like what
is it you know
i don't even know what it's like so
again you know kind of just you know
fill us in is it
is it all just junk food or you know
people does it really depend
on each person like what's that like it
really depends on each person um the
food that's around
uh it oh yeah it really depends on the
tour you're on like for example like on
my solo tours and on the alice cooper
tour
there's a lot of people that want to eat
healthy so there's usually pretty
healthy options
um there's catering backstage at the
shows for the most part and
those you know on my solo tours it says
very specifically it has to be a hot
healthy meal you know something
with you know minimal carbs and a lot of
protein like just something healthy for
us to eat to fuel us up and same thing
with the ascoopa tour there's some
some standards on there there's always a
chicken dish there's always a fish dish
you know there's always some pasta for
people that want to eat that but there
is also
always a dessert which is hard to stay
away from
um and then it's uh it's about grocery
shopping you know
there's there's a fridge on the tour bus
so
if you're willing to you know if you're
the type of person like me that will go
out and go grocery shopping this is what
i do in europe
when there's no trifecta you know you go
to the grocery store once a week and you
get your
hard-boiled eggs and your fruits and you
know something stuff you can make in the
microwave like oatmeal
or chicken you can heat up or anything
like that
um and then you still have good meal
prepped food you know you can get the
sliced deli meats like turkey or chicken
um you know some low-fat cheeses nuts
anything like that
and then you have a good healthy option
to just have at the ready when you know
if you don't have catering or something
like that
whereas if you're the type of person
that doesn't like to go to the grocery
store a you're gonna be spending a lot
of money because you're gonna be eating
out every single meal
you know two to three meals a day seven
days a week for three months
that really adds up and that's it's hard
to find healthy options too so
the grocery store is definitely the way
to go what's like a normal grocery store
that you go to
obviously it depends a little bit but do
you have one that's kind of your your
main go-to i'm a sprouts
grocery store girl okay i love sprouts
um
but uh you know on tour it's just really
it's whatever we can walk to
really because then you get into this
whole situation of do i really want to
spend 30
on an uber so i can go to whole foods or
do i want to walk to a ralphs or an aldi
which is right here
and just get what i can get there so
it's it just depends
depends on the situation yeah i bet and
that's really cool to know that you can
sort of request healthier stuff and
and i'm i mean it does make a lot of
sense that they would try to accommodate
the performers because again it can make
a big difference and i i gotta assume on
how you can perform
you know if you're eating junk all the
time well you might not have
great energy but if you're eating pretty
healthy well you're probably going to do
a lot better when you
start to perform have you noticed that
oh a huge difference
absolutely and you think of it as you
know if you're like the type of athlete
that does two a days
if you're you know that's kind of like
what my schedule is like because i do
an hour to an hour and a half workout in
the morning and then i have a 90 minute
you know concert of running around and
performing you know
very very physically for an hour and a
half
so if you don't fuel your body properly
um
it really really is noticeable and i
know it's the difference between like
you know me and someone else doing the
same show that maybe isn't eating as
healthy or you know has
been drinking about you know a couple
glasses of wine after the show or
whatever it is like you can really tell
the difference um
you know in the physicality of the
performance totally yeah i mean it
really is
it's it's a workout i mean you're it is
you're going hard so yeah that makes
sense the two-time a day analogy for
athletes out there
is perfect too um so before we start
recording you were mentioned something
um
really interesting so you're not
currently on tour
given coronavirus covid all that so
what's it like
not being on tour and do you find that
easier harder
to develop your rhythm and routine
it's so interesting actually you know
because i don't think i've been home for
this long
in eight years ten years maybe
you know i'm usually not home for more
than a couple weeks at a time
maybe you know a month to six weeks at
the most
so having not only been home but then in
the house essentially for the last few
months has been
really an adjustment period right um
but luckily i was able to grab my stuff
from the alice cooper road case so i
have
you know josh and i have a pretty good
little workout set up here now we've got
a set of power block dumbbells
we've got a bunch of resistance bands um
he's got a lot of uh you know like the
sort of physical therapy stuff like the
foam rollers and the ball
you know lacrosse ball and all that kind
of stuff we have a trx
i just bought something called the coba
board which is kind of for
uh training your glutes and your legs
because that's the thing i was really
missing
you know not being in the gym is getting
to do a good leg day right
um so we're kind of like we're kind of
set up with the home workout stuff for
you know for what you can do in the
backyard
um we have gloves josh is really really
um
proficient at muay thai and boxing so we
train you know we do boxing and hit pads
in the backyard together for cardio
um so we kind of we kind of are getting
the hang of it now
after a few months of it totally yeah
you're making it work it sounds like
that's i mean there's so many people out
there that are in the same boat that
it's just kind of
doing whatever you can yeah it's the
only thing you can do
and you know trying to cook healthy
meals every day trying to
really kind of stick with the macros and
i see a lot of people out there on
social media going like well you know
you don't have to be perfect on this
time you don't have to stick to a diet
on this time this is a time that you can
let yourself go you know there are
bigger things going on in the world and
to my way of thinking like yeah there
are bigger things going on in the world
of course but
wouldn't this be something that you can
control you know
maybe it's for me it feels like hey
there are things going on in the world
that i can't control but my diet and my
nutrition and my exercise this is
something that i can control
and it kind of feels good to be
disciplined about it for me
you're actually preaching to the choir
here i've said that numerous times on
the podcast
so uh yeah so everyone knows i did not
pay you to say that you brought that up
on your own
so that's true i'm right there with you
there's so much stuff going on right now
where it gives a lot of people
that that feeling of control back that
hey you know i can't control
state laws or you know where i can go or
what i can do but guess what the one
thing that i can control
is my health my fitness my nutrition
because again if you have a backyard or
even if you don't if you have an
apartment you have a couple weights
you can control that and you can help
set and develop
those habits that routine and that just
it can make all the difference for a lot
of people because fitness is so
important
for mental health overall health all
that
absolutely i i feel like a completely
different person mentally
uh if i work out and if i don't work out
i mean if i miss
a few days like you know i had a i had
to go to the dentist
a few weeks ago and i missed like a week
of working out just because i had
stitches in my mouth and they said don't
do any strenuous exercise or you could
um can mess up the stitches
and i was like irritable and bummed out
and it had nothing to do with like
feeling like i was gaining weight or
anything like that i just think the
endorphins of being able to work out and
like that rush that it gives you that
feeling of being productive
if i have a good workout first thing in
the morning i have the most productive
day
afterward i really do 100
i'm right there i agree with you
absolutely
so what so if we go back a little bit to
you know being on tour what
can you walk us through maybe like a
sample day
of being on tour versus now maybe what
you're doing not on
tour in terms of you know when you might
wake up when you do work out
and how you navigate all that yeah so
actually what's funny is the timing of
my days
is almost exactly the same because i i'm
an early bird
i wake up early like kind of no matter
how late i go to sleep it was even like
this when i was drinking a lot like
even if i stayed up till like 4 a.m you
know hanging out and
having a good time i would still wake up
at seven so
um i wake up at seven every day um
i try to work out pretty much close to
first thing
one thing i'd like to get better about
is um when i'm on tour i pretty much
just get up and go
straight down to the hotel gym now that
i'm home i do find myself like you know
getting on social media getting on the
computer
answering emails that kind of stuff so
um i
try to get my workout in kind of first
thing before the day gets started
um i really like working out with josh
we get i get such a better workout if we
work out
as a team you know it's sort of a
partner workout
um and if he doesn't get his workout in
before all the emails start coming in in
the morning we'll just
it will just never get done so i try to
drag him out first thing in the morning
and get that workout done
and then now that i'm at home it's just
basically
after that it's taking care of stuff
around the house i have a patreon page
that i'm very very active on
we're getting ready for the next body
shrug challenge so i'm getting
a new website full for that all kinds of
fun stuff um figuring out different
sponsors and stuff for the challenge
i'm working on my upcoming solo record
and doing guests
jams like you know a lot of musicians
are doing these quarantine
jams so basically just sort of keeping
super busy with stuff that we can do
around the house now if i'm on tour that
whole day that i just described
gets condensed into the time period from
about 10 a.m
to 1 p.m yeah
so i have uh i wake up at seven uh i
work out
um i'll have my shake you know right
after i work out
and then i'll spend the first couple
hours of the day either recording
guitars or
doing interviews or um you know emails
or anything else like that that i have
to do and then after that i'll have to
go to the venue and
get ready for the show so we go and do
sound check um
you know meet and greet any kind of
stuff like that um and then we do the
show
wow yeah that's pretty crazy and so
what's uh
how late would you be there typically if
you're performing
um typically if it's an alice cooper
show we usually will
stay at the venue until about 11 o'clock
um i i guess you know we go on stage at
8 30
play for an hour and a half um tell a
walk
say hi to anybody if we have any guests
there or anything like that
and then the bus will typically leave
around um
11 or midnight and then we sleep on the
bus to the next city
yeah wow that's that's tough and i mean
you're always always moving always doing
something i guess and
then you're right back at it the next
day yeah it's like groundhog day it's
funny do the exact same thing especially
traveling on a bus because you know you
just wake up and you're in the next
place and
it's like it really is like groundhog
day like you wake up
you know the alarm goes off you know
check your phone wake up get off the bus
okay where's the gym where's the hotel i
think it just
you have to start the whole day over
every day
yeah that's pretty wild i mean that's
really cool to know that
that you take time to prioritize all
that as well
and i think one thing that i found
myself here the last six months or a
year
is yeah i've started working out earlier
in the day as well because there's just
so much other stuff that can accumulate
throughout the day
emails i mean so we have two small kids
so there's all that
it's like you just get up get it done
get after it and then it's out of the
way
and then if anything does pop up hey
cool
then you can do it exactly that's that's
exactly kind of our mentality is
if you leave it till the last thing then
everything piles up all day and by the
time it's time for your workout you're
just so exhausted
right and literally when you're on the
road i mean you couldn't actually do it
later in the day like you're essentially
forced to but it's cool to know that
you're kind of sticking with that
routine even when you're at home
so that way when you do go back on tour
it's just you know you're picking right
off where you left off
yeah i think routine i'm i'm a super
creature of routine like i
if i have things laid out like i'm going
to get up at this time
i'm going to work out from this time
this time i'm going to do my emails from
this time this time and then from you
know
from 3 p.m on i'm going to play guitar
and write my record and do these guest
solos or anything like that
if i have my day broken down like that
it it gets done
so much more efficiently than if i just
kind of think well today i've got all
this stuff to do and i'll figure out
when i'm gonna do it
yeah agreed and if you know it and maybe
have it written down ahead of time it's
you don't have the chance to really skip
it because it's just there and you just
go and do it i mean that's how i feel is
that kind of how you are too it's just
like oh well no
no exactly uh and in fact i use uh habit
tracking apps
for all that stuff i love those things
i use one called habit bowl which um
it's kind of a pavlovian effect kind of
uh
you know you put your habits you know
the stuff that you want to do like in
your daily routine into it and then
when you check it off it makes like a
really nice sound it goes like bling
and if you don't do it that day you have
to make it red and you go
like you know it's like very uh
you know emotional response like
emotional response tied to it
and then i use the checklist app and my
phone to do like you know the more like
day-to-day stuff get dog food finish
this solo write this email
uh call this person or whatever and josh
is
the absolute master of the physical list
like he has his list every day on
printer paper down to a science like if
he puts it on the phone or in the app
it does not work it has to be a physical
list
like written out that he can strike
things off as they go
and it's just about different things
that work for different people
yeah 100 i have an app that i use and it
basically keeps a streak going and this
is not the rp died app by the way which
i also
use every day but it essentially keeps a
run streak of like how many days in a
row that i've used it
and i'm just that type of person that
there was one day where the app
malfunctioned and it reset
my timer and i gotta be honest i was
i was pretty upset about it killed your
whole day didn't it
to be honest a little bit because i was
yes yeah i was at like 42 days
and not reset because i started it
literally day one of the quarantine and
i was like i'm going to keep this going
throughout the entire quarantine
and it reset and i had to go back to day
one and i just was
i was devastated a little bit i was just
like i can't believe this i mean now
so let me ask you this did you miss a
day after that happened
um no there's
i can do little things so normally you
gotta do
like 10 15 minutes and this was
something i i think i sort of
in my head i was like okay well i'm
gonna cheat a little bit and i only did
like a minute or like three minutes or
something
just so i could kind of keep that uh
streak going but i was like i'm not
gonna
not use it because i knew that i had to
get back on that streak so that's just
kind of how my brain works
no me too exactly the same and the app
that i was talking about habit bowl it
has
a streak tracker like that too
and i i'm a total all or nothing person
like if i have a 100
streak going like you know i will
i'll get out of bed to do something so i
don't break that streak you know like
i'll be in bed i'll be like i'm gonna go
to sleep i'm like oh i forgot to take
you know i've got my morning and my
night supplements on there so i have to
click off supplements two times because
sometimes i forget to take the first
thing in the morning ones or the evening
ones
so you know i'll be laying in bed like
you know drift down to sleep and i'll
look at my app and i'll go ah
there's one thing left i have to
literally get up out of bed to do it so
i don't break my
100 success freak i i mean
it's like talking to a clone because
i've done that as well
you're laying there and so for me i
don't think i have those notifications
but i'll just
be laying there and i'm like oh shoot
i'm like oh man i didn't do that
yeah like okay well i gotta get up i
gotta go do it and then i
i do it and i'm like okay great i'm good
to go now
what's the app that you use uh headspace
oh cool i've been thinking about i've
been seeing the ads for that
do you like it uh yeah i'm pretty sure
there's another one uh my wife uses it
um yeah i gotta imagine those those apps
are really seeing a boom right now just
from
hopefully people wanting to prioritize
mental health and
taking that a bit more serious so i i
gotta imagine they're doing really well
right now
always good thing yeah totally um so
just to circle back a little bit so you
had mentioned your body shred challenge
and so
i'm just curious if we circle back maybe
probably a little over a year now year
and a half how did you originally find
out about rp
um i guess i found out about rp
through the trifecta camp so i've been
eating trifecta food for the last couple
years
and uh you know my boyfriend josh works
closely with them
and um you know so i guess that would
have been my first
exposure to what you guys do at rp
and then i started following the social
media pages and seeing the
incredible transformations um and i was
asking josh like
what are they doing how are they doing
this with these people
and um i think a little before that we
had had the idea
to launch uh my fitness challenge which
is called body shred
and the impetus for body shred was
you know when i got myself into shape
and i started working out i started you
know
being in publications like
bodybuilding.com muscle and fitness
you don't see a lot of musicians in
these fitness spaces
and so the music community started
asking like well
kind of what i was asking about rp like
what did you do how did you do it
and uh the more i looked into it
i realized that there was no fitness
space
for my community for the music community
a lot of the fitness world can be so
intimidating for
somebody that's not really into fitness
you know that's
a lot of the influencers and the you
know the transformations and before and
afters seem really unattainable and
really like
i don't want to say unrelatable but kind
of unrelatable to someone that's
that fitness isn't their life you know
you're like these people have like
matching outfits
and all the movements look easy and
um i don't like any of this music that
they're playing and i thought
wouldn't it wouldn't it be cool if you
know josh and i could create something
some kind of space for our community for
the rock and roll
music community to have like a group of
like-minded people
and give them prizes that they would
want and uh
you know something to get help motivate
them to get in better shape because our
community is
not the healthiest one right you know so
uh so that was sort of where body shred
was born
and i thought you know i know a lot
about working out not
as much as some but i know a good bit
but something i
would not feel comfortable coaching
anyone on is their nutrition because i
have no background in it
i know what works for me but i wouldn't
want to start designing meal plans for
someone that wasn't roughly my height
and weight
so um so that was where you know
we decided to contact rp about coming on
board and providing the nutrition
solutions for the course and it's just
been
incredible seeing you know the changes
that people are making using
the workout program that i made and the
nutrition templates that you guys made
it's just
unreal yeah i gotta be i gotta be honest
it's really cool and i
i'm just so into the hardcore fitness
space
that it's almost like losing touch a
little bit
with people that fitness isn't their
priority
and i'm sure you know what i'm talking
about because i would see questions in
your facebook group like you know i
would get tagged or something in there
and of course i told you guys i can't
tag me anytime
i'll hop in and answer questions and and
thank you for that
yeah yeah totally and i just i almost
had forgotten that you know people are
asking like
what's protein what what are carbs and
i'm just like
oh wow i mean oh totally yeah
it's it kind of you know blew my mind
all over again because i've just gotten
so lost
into the space where sort of everyone
knows that and i had to step back and go
man there's a lot of people that don't
really have
much education when it comes to
nutrition and so being able to partner
with someone like yourself
that's going to reach a wider audience
which is really really cool
and then you know some of these people
they would get these insane results
again they're not fitness professionals
they're just
normal everyday people that just you
know happen to
follow you or be a fan and now are in
you know great
shape and a lot healthier it's just
really really cool to see
no it's been like you know and i see
this to josh all the time i can only
imagine what
how gratifying it must be for you guys
every day to get to do what you do
because i mean just to get to do it a
couple times a year for me
is like one of the most gratifying
things i've ever done to see that people
are now emailing me saying
i've gotten off high blood pressure
medicine or i have more energy to play
with my kids or you know i had a couple
people
say that they got off of their
antidepressant medicine
you know much less the the physical
changes like you know i've been into
smaller jeans or
you know my husband is complimenting the
way i look which he hasn't done since we
were married you know we first got
married
or little things like that you know from
the huge lifestyle changes of
getting off of a medication to a little
thing like you know
i was able to shop in a normal-sized
store instead of a plus-sized store
for the first time since high school or
something like that like these are the
things that i never
imagined as a musician i'd be making
that kind of impact in someone's life so
it's
it's an incredible feeling you guys are
so so blessed that you guys get to do
this all the time and help people all
the time
yeah well thank you so much it is really
cool and it's one of these things where
it never gets old hearing from people
that have good results or make these big
changes
and whether it's whether it's a really
shocking before and after
or like you said just hey i'm down 10
pounds and
you know i can run around now or you
know i ran for the first time in a
couple years or
you know so we work with uh dr spencer
nodolsky
and you know he'll get messages all the
time and his whole thing is sort of
lifestyle as medicine
and that you know he wants people to to
hopefully not have to take medicine and
if they need to of course they can and
should of course
but again people type 2 diabetics or you
know
overweight obese well you start working
out you do you start feeling so much
better and it is really cool to see that
and sometimes that gets lost a little
bit because we're sort of
working with a slightly more athletic
population but then when we do get those
people
that you know start up fitness for the
first time in their entire life
there's literally nothing better than
seeing that and i think that's even
better in in a lot of regards than to
a top athlete performing really well
because it's like okay well
that's obviously really cool so those
changes are just on another level
because you're
i don't know what maybe the right way to
say it is but you're like truly making a
life impact
on that person that now you know doesn't
have to take their medicine or whatever
no totally i'm going to blow your mind
right now so my
body shred group um you know obviously
the pandemic has affected
every single person on the planet and
they are no exception
so body shred two ended like right
around the time the pandemic started
and i told them you know i'm not going
to extend that you know so many of them
were like i want to extend the challenge
i want to go longer because this is
going to keep me disciplined at home
and i said well i'm not going to extend
the challenge i'm not going to change
the goal post now that you guys are done
but
how's this we're going to add a second
like an you know auxiliary challenge
and we're going to do a plank challenge
and i want you guys to
hold a plank every day for 30 days and
try to add
five seconds to your plank you know no
more
if you want to add more that's great but
just try for five seconds a day
and if you do five seconds a day for 30
days like five additional seconds a day
for 30 days
like you'll have already done an amazing
job
so we did this challenge and i had
people starting
who could only hold a plank for 20
seconds and by
day 30 you know i had them post a
picture of their timer
on their phone this 30-second plank
holders were holding like four or
five-minute planks
i had two people in there that were
holding over a 45-minute plank
by the end of the 35 by the end of the
30 days and these are not athletes
these are just people who are like you
know what i can do something for 30
seconds a day and try to do five extra
seconds
this is something i can take a few
minutes out of my day maybe the 45
minute guy like
he took more than a few minutes out of
his day but
you know i mean i've never held a
10-minute plank
you know like i think most people in the
world have never held a 10-minute plank
and you know one of the girls in the
bodystride group kaylee who's really
good with numbers calculated everybody's
percentages
and we have people had a thousand
percent increase
in their playing cold time you know 700
500
you know it's just incredible to see
what the human mind can do if you just
go yeah you know what i'll be consistent
about something for 30 days
it's amazing boom yeah 100
i got to be honest i think i can maybe
do a minute or two plank
and if i'm being completely you're in
amazing shape nick
like it's crazy no go on please nobody
30 30 try it five seconds a day for 30
days now i'm challenging you
yeah totally i actually i make my kids
uh
do planks because i sort of have become
their
pseudo coach because we can't really do
sports and whatever but
that's usually one of them and at that
age it's kind of like the whole
gymnastics thing where you're just
working on balance and coordination
and strength and if you can do that
they're gonna have a really good
foundation later on
sure absolutely um yeah that's really
cool and
it is really really rewarding to see and
hear that stuff and to get that feedback
and you know it never gets old and i
know people might think oh he's just
saying that but
it doesn't matter you know whether it's
seven years ago or whether it's still
today like it's still really cool to see
no there's another another girl in the
body shred group martina who
uh does the rp hyper thyroid program
and it's amazing because she was that
type of person that was like you know i
can't really get results no matter what
i do
and um you know very hard worker martina
like very very good work ethic but just
wasn't seeing what she needed to
and then working with someone like
yourself
who you know really can zero in on what
works for that body type
she's had amazing results like you know
she's getting super jacked
it's just so cool to see the
hyperthyroidism one is really
a unique case too because it's really a
lot harder
to lose weight when you have that uh
sure
hypothyroidism i'm sorry i said
hyperthyroidism because
i think i probably said it wrong first
oh no no worries
in my head i was a little off there
hyper would actually make it easier to
lose weight which you know i wish i had
that
right right i actually did have that for
a short time in high school and it was
probably equally as bad and i know
people are gonna roll their eyes but i
would just eat and eat and eat and eat
and i would lose weight the crappy thing
is is i would lose
energy and i was into sports so it was
just it was bad news for a while
yeah i guess as a guy you wouldn't want
to have the but as a girl it wouldn't be
necessarily as bad
but i guess anything's bad and you know
if it's too much
totally yeah it's one of those things
it's you you start going off the deep
end either way
and you know most most things are going
to end up in the middle where you want
to be
um so i have another question too and
this is something
so i'm i'm opening my my morning emails
one day
and just reading through some stuff and
one of them that i'm subscribed to is
the daily stoic newsletter
you know ryan holiday all that stuff
really cool books
and i'm reading through it and he he
mentions a female guitarist and i'm like
oh
i know a female guitarist actually
that's really unique
and i'm reading i'm like well that's
that's nita
i was i was blown away i was like i
immediately i texted josh and i was like
hey
i was like was nita just in this and he
was like oh yeah totally yeah he like
you know
nina knows ryan it's totally cool i'm
like whoa
can you like one i'm a big fan of the
the stoicism idea in general i think
it's just especially right now of course
given
coronavirus and everything fantastic
mindset to have
but how did how did you sync up with
with that and you know how did you kind
of get featured in that i know that's
really really popular yeah so the
obstacle is
the way totally changed my life like
probably a lot of other people's but i
read the obstacle is the way
at exactly the right time um it was
something that i
really really needed like that mentality
shift
um you know to hear the impediment to
action advances action what stands away
becomes the way like that was something
that
you know so many people think well if
it's hard you're probably not supposed
to be doing it
you know and to hear sort of the
complete
opposite um the complete opposite
philosophy broken down
so succinctly and with so many great
examples you know reading the nick saban
quotes in the book and reading
all the different great thinkers from
you know sort of the modern generation
echoing back to those ancient thoughts
uh it just blew
my mind so um i think i the way that we
had gotten in touch was i put up a post
about it
i think i just posted and tagged them
and just said hey if you guys are
looking
for reading material like this
completely changed my life
and um i ended up getting in touch with
ryan holliday and
he interviewed me for the daily stoic
blog
which was a huge honor again kind of
like this something that i normally
don't i don't get to talk about stuff
outside of like how long have you been
playing guitar and
you know who are your favorite guitar
players and what advice you have for
your musicians to kind of
step out into something else that i'm
super passionate about and get to chat
about
mindset and dedication and mentality and
overcoming obstacles
um that was a really really cool chance
to get to speak with him about that
so yeah it's cool that he hearkened back
to it in the in the newsletter
yeah totally so just for someone that
maybe doesn't subscribe to that doesn't
really know what we're talking about
can you maybe just give a quick example
of how you use
the socialism mindset into how that
relates into
what you do now when you're performing
yeah i think the best example
would probably be uh momentum worry
and that is you know when they
when they would return from battles and
when when there was
they were celebrating the victory and
everything seemed amazing to have
parades in the streets and
you know wine and women and um you know
this
really over the top festivity um they
would have
one slave stand over the general's ear
and whisper to him memento mori which
means
remember you're mortal remember that all
of this is going to end someday and it's
not going to mean anything
don't get caught up in your own hype
because it's all going to end someday
and i feel like that relates so closely
to
my life as a musician you know you go on
stage and you have
you know thousands sometimes hundreds of
thousands of people cheering and
screaming your name and you know have
all this adoration and attention and
you know same thing on social media like
you know the likes and the comments and
all this stuff but none of it really
means anything you can't take it with
you
so you have to remember not to get
caught up in all that and just focus on
what's important
yeah and having some gratitude for the
opportunities that you do have rather
than sort of taking it for granted
absolutely you know it's it's good to be
confident but it's not good to be
cocky you know you can't be like yeah i
deserve all this i know
i should have all this adoration i
should have all this attention you know
to have that gratitude and
take a step back and appreciate each
moment rather than
you know and savor it rather than just
kind of throwing it away
yeah boom that's that's awesome i i'm
again
i agree 100 this has been really cool to
to hear that and
yeah it was cool i literally remember
texting josh and i was like dude
i didn't know this uh that's really cool
i have a question that probably builds
off of that a little bit
so you know if you're performing or
whatever how do you deal
with with critics
um i think the most important thing with
criticism is
to remember that it doesn't really
change
anything you know someone else's opinion
doesn't really change anything about
what you
actually do you know it's not like my
heroes are out there
sending messages like you suck you know
my heroes and my peers are are telling
me that i'm on the right track
you know it's just people that i think
they used to say people that can't do
teach and now i think people that can't
do just comment
on the internet and i don't think you
have to look much further than spencer's
instagram which by the way
best memes in the game on dr nodolsky's
instagram but i mean i see
it's a great example right there of
someone who is constantly putting out
great information and
getting random people that you know
generally don't seem to know much of
what they're talking about just
criticizing it
[Music]
an interesting thing that i try to think
of when it comes to criticism
in i think most people would be lying
if if they would say that it doesn't
impact them now there's a difference
between letting it impact you
for an extended period of time or just
sort of seeing it
acknowledging it and then moving on but
it
seems to and this is what you had just
touched on a little bit
when you're criticized it's almost never
by people
that are above you are really on the
same level it's always
people that are trying to take shots
that you know haven't done it before and
that sort of goes back to the
you know teddy roosevelt quote from what
the early 1900s and it's like
yeah well shoot if that was going on you
know 120 years ago
i mean we're it's still human nature
here we are
in 2020 and we're still dealing with
this probably on a bigger level because
of social media
absolutely and i'll take your almost
never and raise it to it never because
it is
literally never anybody like you know
i've never seen
any super successful musician on there
um you know criticizing other you know
other musicians vibrato i've never seen
you know a really successful bodybuilder
go on and critique
a new lifter's form you know you suck
exactly you know that that'll never
happen maybe like a little
you know constructive critique but not
you know the kind that we're talking
about
i think the important thing is really to
to realize that
whatever it is whether it's you know a
good comment or a bad comment or a
critique or
you know someone giving you a compliment
it doesn't actually change anything
about what you did
you know like uh josh told me a long
time ago when we first started dating
and i used to get really down
after you know reading some of the
comments about myself there's a
there's a music site which is kind of
like the tmz of
of rock music and the comments on there
are just
assessed pool there's never anything
good on there it's you know there's
it's few and far between but for the
most part it's just people's being jerks
just because that's their space to go
and be a jerk
and i would go in there and read it and
you know i'd have something great happen
in my life and i'd go on there and it
was just
crass rude you know overtly sexual
you know just disgusting comments in
there and i'm like does nothing that i
do
you know i would i would get tears in my
eyes but just nothing that i do mean
anything
when i always only gonna have this and
and he said just don't look at it
you know whether they're saying good
things or whether they're saying bad
things
just you know keep your eyes on the
prize and focus on what's important and
you know the good things will come yeah
man it's it's tough out there on social
media and
i think it's really hard it's i don't
know if it's human nature but i find
myself
like i have to read it and now i'll i'll
laugh and so actually before we started
the podcast today i had
i had looked at some stuff and i was
just kind of smiling and my wife looked
over she's like what are you laughing
about i'm like i'm just reading some
some reviews and comments and one of
them was actually about this podcast i'm
just like oh boy
like here we go and it's just it's it's
really interesting to me
how you can have a thousand reviews and
they can you can have 999
five-star reviews and you have one
one bad review and that's the one that
we tend to focus on as humans and it
just
blows my mind i'm like stop why am i
doing this but
i can't that's absolutely it's so true
it's so so so true and now what's funny
is
as i'm sure you know people know this
now
you know people see that the way to get
attention from you is to say something
negative for no reason
um and you know i have fallen into this
trap
everybody's guilty of falling into it at
one point or another
but you know you have a hundred comments
on the post
and one says something rude or something
you know i'm
completely out of the blue and so you
the human nature is to step in and
defend yourself and say i didn't say
that
why i didn't do that or like why you
know what you say is and then they say
oh
well she responded so they got exactly
what they wanted
it has nothing to do with actually not
liking what i'm doing it's just about
getting a response getting
the encouragement yeah it is really
unfortunate and
listen social media is good for a lot of
things but it's sort of equally bad in a
lot of regards too
so it's one of those double-edged swords
yes
exactly um josh has a clothing company
called beverly kills
and their whole motivation the whole
message is
you know empowerment being yourself you
know
not letting your ego take over very very
similar to the stoic philosophy
i'm sure ego kills talent um you know
they have another shirt that says stay
humble or be humbled
another one says integrity not for sale
and
you know the whole message of these
shirts is like overwhelmingly positive
and you know supportive and
you know they give shout outs to people
that wear their stuff all the time and
then people go in the comments section
and just are like needlessly negative
it's like for what this is a company
doing good things and
you know helping people and and
spreading a positive message and you're
going to go in and like
is it that important in your day to you
know talk bad
in the comments section of a t-shirt
company yeah
that's that probably leads to a whole
nother podcast about the
motivations of folks that choose to do
that but
i won't go down that that's a rabbit
hole
yeah for sure i had one last question
that i wanted to ask you and then
i know you got to get going you're super
super busy um
so being a guitarist is accomplished as
yourself
do you i'm just curious as like how
often you still
sort of train or practice your craft
nowadays
not as much as i'd like to to be
perfectly honest
um one thing that i'm really
sort of hoping to take a step back and
do during this
isolation time is to focus in on my
craft a little bit more
but as you know as so many great
athletes know and you know so many
entrepreneurs know
you know the more success you find in
your field the less
time you actually get to spend in your
fields i feel like you know
there's so many other things that go
into
the anita strauss brand for lack of a
better word you know
finding doing the keeping up with the
different social media pages and
creating the contents of the post and
you know make writing new music and
doing these guest appearances and doing
you know interviews and podcasts and
starting our different ventures like the
the fitness challenge and i just
released an uh guitar course
an online course for people that um are
picking up the guitar for the very first
time that want to learn how to play
so um you know getting that off the
ground which is uh
if you guys want to check that out it's
i want to play guitar.com
and that's for literally somebody that
has just picked up the guitar for the
first time and wants to learn
so um you know getting the instructional
course off the ground like all these
different things and by the end of the
day
you're like struggling to get your
workout in and and prep your food and
you know not be busy and then you go oh
yeah i didn't practice today
so it's hard yeah well okay that is
really cool to know yeah just i was
curious and
i you nailed it again because you just
get so wrapped up in all these other
things that it's
it's hard to kind of get back to what
got you there
so to speak it is it really is and i
think it's just about
prioritizing you know finding the time
in the day and
um but really finding the time is the
hardest part
i don't know if it's just me but i feel
like you would think that the days
during the isolation and the quarantine
would be really long but i feel like
they're actually really short
it would just say or something just the
weekend wasn't it
like wasn't it just the weekend
yesterday and now it's gonna be thursday
tomorrow
well yeah so that's one of these things
