hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
quick tip
weekly tip number 21 hold the machine
rose at the top
for a few seconds what the hell is this
going to give us let's find out so
generally speaking more muscle growth is
stimulated
to occur at
the bottom stretch position of almost
every lift
than at the peak contraction right so do
not skimp out on the bottom range of
rows
because that's where a lot of the growth
happens it's also that painful deep
stretch at the bottom of rows is really
really good
however
in my experience
the top of rows from here to here
tends to hit some muscles that the
bottom might miss out on a little bit
specifically muscles like the spinal
rectors
muscles like the mid traps muscles like
the rhomboids yes there is a muscle in
there called the rhomboid and i also
know it is in fact a shape
that
musculature erectors mid-traps rhomboids
give you that density tank look that
tank shit where someone's like what the
fuck is wrong with that guy's back yes
wide lats are cool but lats are not even
the majority of your back size if you
have big ass traps mid traps lower traps
upper traps
big ass rhomboids big ass tears major
muscles
huge spinal erectors
man you're well on your way to having an
awesome back a good guy to look up for
that is johnny jackson
i think now retired bodybuilder uh or
close to retirement case
massive massive dude one of the best
backs of all time
cool lats not the greatest lats of all
time not the greatest uh front double
buy none of that liz lats were huge but
compared to the rest of his back not so
big
his erectors from deadlifting fucking
800 for reps or some shit his traps his
rhomboids etc that middle thick part of
the back was so insane you look at his
back and you're like what the fuck is
that so
back and lat training is not ever
synonymous and anyone who makes that
mistake
is probably someone to look at
interestingly if you follow them like oh
maybe they don't know everything all
right so
here we're talking about rowing and
really pulling towards the last bit
squeezing and holding
can you do that with free weight rows
barbell and dumbbell rows well
holding at the top and squeezing is a
little bit tough for those because you
also have to mind your posture
and you end up having to use so
little weight in order to squeeze at the
top because biomechanically the leverage
gets worse and worse the higher up you
go
that you have to drop the weight so much
it ends up
sort of robbing you of the stretch
stimulus which isn't ideal so i would
say on free rows just gently touch your
tummy with barbell or gently come out to
here with dumbbell don't pause don't
stop because if you have to pause and
stop for the rep ranges to make sense
you have to use too little weight so
regular rows just touch gently but
machine rows
can
use a little bit of modification to be
better because a lot of people do
machine rows the same way they do
regular rows do whatever normal cadence
which is totally fine but what you can
do is take your machine rows and change
the cadence a little bit
yes stretch out all the way in machine
rows but on the way back up
especially if it's a chest support row
try to retract your scapulae
really push your chest up and out elbows
back as far and hold that top position
for one or two whole seconds
it is going to be painful agony because
all the muscles that do this to your
back are going to be contracted at the
same time and then slowly release big
stretch around over
re-arching two and slow back down
if you try your machine rows like that
they may fry your fucking back in a much
different way pretty safe way because
you can't use a ton of technique great
variation it's not magic but it fucking
works give it a shot thank you later see
you next time
