hey folks dr mike isatel here for
rp plus rp university lecture number
four in nutrition for fat loss
ranges and durations of weight loss and
measuring progress so let's find out
what we're going to talk about today
we're going to talk about why weight
loss is important for fat loss
there's a lot of people say well you
know i want to lose fat but i don't want
to lose weight or can i just
get lean without losing weight we'll see
why that sometimes doesn't add up
we'll talk about how progress is
measured specifically there's a couple
of ways to do it all of them together
are a really good combination
we're going to talk about durations
after specifically why losing too slow
has problems
while losing too fast has problems as
far as weight loss per week
i'm going to talk about best loss rates
per week and then we're going to talk
about durations
why there are some really big downsides
to too short of a fat loss phase
and why there are some downsides to too
long of a fat loss phase and what the
sweet spot is between there for best
loss durations so
first up why is weight loss important
for
fat loss well another way to put this is
ask a question of why
can't we just lean out while maintaining
our body weight
right like why does losing fat mean
losing weight well
we actually can lean out while
maintaining our body weight but
it's not the most reliable way to go
for a couple of reasons the biggest one
is
if you are in fact maintaining your body
weight
how do you know you're burning fat how
do you know you're leaning out
well you can start to look different get
better definition
that kind of stuff starts to show up
weeks
plural and months into a plan
and it's not apparent right away
and sometimes because of stress and body
water it might not be apparent
gee like even for a month or more
so whatever plan you think you're doing
that you think is
hoping is working it's just not apparent
that it's working
but if you're losing weight you can be
sure that
much of that weight is fat so it's not
very reliable because
you know you can be doing all the right
things and can be losing a little bit of
fat
while maintaining weight but it's just
so difficult to detect we can't rely on
it like if someone said hey like
i have a really important occasion i
need to be leaner for
i would have them lose weight because
that clearly tells us if they're losing
weight every single week more or less
something's happening weight is being
lost tissue is being lost
fat is being lost now it's also
not just not reliable so we can't count
on it being a good measure
it's also not optimal not even close why
well in order to maintain the same body
size same weight
and lean out you have to add something
what is that something well it's muscle
of course you're not going to grow brain
tissue or heart tissue or liver tissue
you're going to get bigger muscles while
decreasing your fat
at the same rate right for both to
result in zero weight loss so for
example if you lose
two pounds of fat per week but your
weight doesn't go down
that would really sort of imply you know
outside of hormonal body water stuff
which we'll cover later
that you would have to have gained two
pounds of muscle and people say like oh
sometimes you don't lose for a long time
and
just muscle gain that's okay in
beginners that's definitely a thing
when you get more advanced even just as
an intermediate a couple of
months or years of good nutrition and
training it just doesn't
really happen nearly that fast anymore
you just can't gain muscle that fast
to offset a fat loss rate that's
anywhere remotely impressive so like
most people of most sizes
can lose a pound of fat per week no
problem for 12 weeks
how many people can gain 12 pounds of
muscle in 12 weeks
gee maybe your first 12 weeks of
training maybe your second 12 weeks of
training
after that pounds of muscle are gained
over years not weeks
so it's just nowhere near optimal to try
to do that so in other words if you try
to lose fat while not losing weight
you're going to end up losing fat at
such a slow pace you could have just
gone way way faster
and then it's an efficiency problem not
even close to optimum
and this is because of our sort of soft
limit here
recomposition which is increasing muscle
mass while decreasing fat mass at the
same time
is just a lot slower and harder than a
net loss of fat
keeping your muscle the same size while
losing fat is very straightforward it's
not overly difficult
easy to track and it occurs at a pretty
fast pace you can lose a lot of fat
rapidly relative to a stable muscularity
but if you cap your fat loss at the same
time trying to gain muscle at that rate
you're going to be doing
tiny fractions of a percentage point per
week it's just
really not the best idea now
you could say okay it's not the best
idea but i want to go slow i don't want
to eat
too little food is it going to work it
is going to work for a while
here's where it almost certainly stops
working below 10
body fat for males roughly on average
and 15 for females
recomposition is damn near impossible
one
when you get to be pretty lean your body
hangs onto fat
real well and it needs a hypocaloric
condition
less calories coming in than going out
in order to be
relieved of that fat right because
otherwise it's just not going to let it
go and
during such a low body fat percentage
your body is so
um the opposite of prone
so resistant to anabolism for muscle so
resistant to muscle growth
that getting muscle growth at some 10
body fat unless you're eating a
hypercaloric diet so an iso-caloric diet
adds up 10
body fat gee you know it's real hard to
grow muscle and
so when you say well you know like i'm
eight percent i don't wanna like get to
six percent but i don't wanna lose any
weight
you're literally saying you wanna gain
muscle while at eight
sixty eight percent body fat um and you
wanna lose fat at the same time
that is damn near impossible forever for
almost everyone and if it is to extend
as possible it happens like
tiny fractions of a pound per month so
it's it's really just
a real hard limit there so you could say
you know i i'm at 20 fat right now and i
want to get to 15
fat over the next year you might be able
to recomp that you might be able to keep
your weight roughly the same and just
lose fat and gain muscle
you're going below 10 or 15 for females
that's not going to happen you're going
to stay the same and it's going to be
months and months of wasted work
another hard limit is uh
you know when individuals that are much
larger say i just want to like
build muscle and lose fat at the same
time yeah
leaning out works but you're not gonna
build that much muscle that you're gonna
lean out
to let's say you're 400 pounds you're
not going to be a lean 400
why because there's like five people in
the world that are lean 400 or they're
all like 6'5 or taller
and you know you don't just gain that
much muscle in a year or two years or
three years or 10 years like it takes
like two decades and it's not very
healthy to be that size anyway muscle or
fat
so you know someone is 300 pounds 400
pounds
and they say well you know i don't want
to lose weight so much as i want to lean
out unless they're a very highly
competitive strong man athlete and
then even then is probably not a good
idea it's just real reliable to lose
weight
so is weight loss important for fat loss
it is central to fat loss
you can lose fat without it but you're
essentially coming to the battle with
all of your best weapons left behind
and to that note we said earlier that
there was a problem
even measuring progress as to how much
fat you're losing if you don't lose any
weight why
for progress measurement our number one
tool in our tool bag
is for body weight you measure your body
weight
multiple times per week and you take the
average that allows all the little
deviations water weight i ate some
chinese food here
and i got a little bloated all of that
will wash out
and if you take at least two
measurements a week
probably three four etc is better but
nothing that takes you off your schedule
you know if you're someone that travels
on the weekends you don't want to take
your body weight on weekends maybe some
random hotels get a weird scale and no
scale at all
but two times a week anywhere between
two and well technically seven times a
week
uh you don't get any bonus points for
anything over six i don't think
um you take those averages and if your
body weight is going down
you could be pretty sure you're losing
fat at least to some extent you might
also be losing muscle that's pretty
unlikely if your program's really well
put together
so as long as your body is going down
over time you're good
some weeks it won't go down but you're
still losing fat because of hormonal
body water stuff sometimes your body
water can be elevated due to cortisol
due to stress due to a number of other
things
and uh but over two weeks over three
weeks if you're losing weight
you're on track if you're not losing
weight something's up
next number two for progress measurement
is
your rep efforts on your lifts
especially with good technique and with
isolation lifts
because they're not super technical
these lifts allow you to measure
how much work your muscles can put out
so you take the same weight
or the same reps in a different weight
and you try to match or beat your
previous performances
if you can match or beat your previous
performances you probably haven't lost
any muscle or much muscle to worry about
nothing you're going to not gain back in
a couple of days or weeks
after you stop the diet but if your
strength is steadily and progressively
declining
sometimes strength declines within
several weeks of a diet because your
glycogen stores
shrink down but it should stabilize
after if your strength is
really going down especially towards the
end of a diet it's starting to go down
really fast
you're probably losing quite a bit of
muscle so almost ideally what we want to
see
is body weight reduction with a
stability sometimes an increase
but stability is good enough of
repetition strength in your lifts if
you're doing that
almost all of your gains are purified or
sorry almost all of your losses are pure
fat which is
really sweet why we know that if your
rep strength isn't going down
anywhere in the 5 to 30 rep range or
hypertrophy training
you're probably not losing muscle and
because losing muscle causes a real
rapid strength loss
and if you are losing body weight
okay we're not losing muscle we're
losing body weight unless we're like you
know
pieces of our brain are falling out
we're almost certainly losing fat
right and then number three is mirror
appearance and close fit
uh so for example um you know how big
are like
your arms and legs how tight are you and
your arms and legs versus your waist so
like a really good sign
do you have a t-shirt and you're losing
fat and it feels pretty similar in the
arms but like
you just have way more baggage in your
waist wow my waist is getting
real slim here right or even if
everything's getting slim it's a pretty
good sign you're losing fat
if your arms and legs are you know
relatively similar in tightness
but you're losing a lot in the waist
that's good because that means you're
holding on to muscle and losing a ton of
fat at the same time
mirror appearance like you know you can
tell when you look different the thing
is if it's your first run-through or
your second run through a diet
you might not be able to tell you don't
know what you're looking for but after a
while you get to look at your physique
especially if you take progress pictures
every week or two weeks
or if you just generally check the
mirror you know every couple of days you
kind of take a detail look at the mirror
or do some poses or something or just
stand there so
i'm trying to see how your um abdominal
area shaped specifically
you could sort of pick up on if things
are changing right at some point you've
never seen your abs before
you got four abs poking out something's
happening you're losing fat
now the mirror in appearance and close
fit that stuff's not as important as
body weight and
reps for your lift it's just not
one of the reasons it's not there's a
lot of subjectivity to it
so you can elude yourself and not
necessarily in the beneficial direction
it could be in the negative direction it
could be in the positive so for example
if you tend to be a pessimistic person
you can just think you look the same in
the mirror your clothes don't seem to
fit different
but you've lost like six pounds and your
reps have gone up on your lift
like you're in a real good spot but you
just don't think so highly of yourself
you're very self-critical other people
you know they'll have gained two pounds
and their lifts are not so great
but they sort of feel like they look
better in the mirror sort of anything to
justify their ego right so
um mirror appearance close fit is
something you use like
every now and again or you keep track of
it a while but you don't put stock into
it unless you see clear clear
differences
we prefer to stick to the first two more
objective options and lastly
you can do a dexa scan a bod pod a skin
folds or a bia measurement
skin folds are really not so valuable
they should be administered by a very
expert person the same person should do
your skin folds every time
bia body electrical impedance analysis
or bioelectrical impedance
analysis is uh really error prone it's
pretty reliable then it gives you a
change but it's not very accurate so
like
if it says you're 15 body fat you could
be 25 percent you could be five percent
for all you know
um so ba is not that great skin phone's
okay but it has to be a trained operator
bottom pod's pretty decent and ducks was
pretty good but they have really big air
rangers
uh on average so what we'd recommend is
um
focus on body weight and your rep
strength
over the weeks uh keep an eye on
the um mirror and close fit
uh over months right so every month your
clothes should be fitting a little
looser in the
in the places you store fat and your
mirror appearance should be like
something different you know like
especially if you take pictures which is
good let's say you take pictures once a
month
and after the first weeks of four weeks
of dieting you should be able to be like
oh wow i
really do look different after another
four weeks you should be like wow okay
like i'm a different person
right um and then dexa bod pod skin
folds this is going to be a potentially
i don't know if it's a controversial
statement so much but it's definitely
uh a lot of people don't follow this
practice we actually uh rp we only
recommend
doing dexa's body pod skin folds ba
probably once a year
maybe twice a year at the most why the
air ranges in these things even on a
dexa it's pretty
pretty big one percent error two percent
error
if you're going through full muscle gain
and fat loss cycles
you could be gaining two percent muscle
per year no fat
that's pretty good gain um add that up
over some years and you start to look
pretty
pretty jacked but the dexa might miss
that entirely bod pod will almost
certainly miss that and skin folds
don't even bother right so and if we
contract that to
three months it's almost all error like
yeah after a year these things can tell
you some good stuff
but you know after three months
sometimes they can sometimes they can't
get a little bit more detailed a dexa is
going to be able to tell you after three
months if you lost fat or not
the exact amount of fat you lost is
going to be much less a convincing
number the muscle mass changes are going
to be almost a total wash a lot of
that's just body water
so not super indicative there bod pod
same idea except less precise skin folds
over three months are honestly just like
a giant waste of time
what skin folds really measures how
thick your fat folds are like in the
literal sense
and if you can't tell that after three
months just looking at your physique
the error rate for skin folds covers up
anything they're gonna tell you
right so for formal data tracking if
you're training an entire athletic team
you don't really know what everyone
looks exactly
skin folds are totally cool for everyone
else skin folds are probably a bigger
waste of time than they are in
investment
decks on bod pod are great but probably
just once a year to get a good
measurement at the end of every major
cut you do once a year
is okay last time my dexa had made 160
pounds of muscle
dead 12 percent fat this year was 9 fat
and 168 pounds of muscle like that's the
kind of change you want to see that's
really really awesome
short of that it doesn't do you much
good definitely don't get get indexes
every month it's just
going to confuse the hell out of you
it's going to confuse your coaches it's
going to confuse everyone
because it's not data that is so precise
as to be useful so mostly
bodyweight tracking and replift you can
use bodyweight tracking and rep lifts up
until you get super duper lean
and then when you get super duper lean
if you ever want to do a bodybuilding
show or something you just use number
three mirror appearance
right hari and yoda how do you know
bodybuilders ready to step on stage when
they look like they're ready to step on
stage at that point body weight doesn't
even matter
and rep lifts don't really matter
because nobody cares how strong you are
what your body fat is
as far as numbers they care about what
you look like right and then
body weight and replies get you to that
point where mirror appearance is the
only thing that matters four weeks out
of a bodybuilding show
so what basically ends up happening is
you know you don't really don't need a
dexa body pod skin folds etc
you can do them as kind of these cool
curiosities just to see what's going on
and set some maybe some goals and some
bass lines
but really they're just um you know sort
of trivialities luxury items i would say
all right switching gears all right so
we know how to measure progress and
it's actually considerably more basic
than maybe some people thought
let's talk about some potential problems
of losing too slowly let's say we're
being super conservative
and we decide to lose super slow and
super slow means uh much less than
half a percent of your body weight per
week so let's say you weigh 200 pounds
this would be like a pound per week or
less
so let's just say your goal is like half
a pound a week you're 200 pounds you
want to lose some fat you're like all
right half a pound a week let's do it
right .25
what are some problems with that first
of all we have a weight tracking problem
if you're losing half a pound per week
that is the equivalent of two pounds per
month
the thing is a lot of regular bathroom
scales are only accurate to within a
pound anyway
so you've just reduced your accuracy of
vision to two weeks
okay how are you supposed to update your
diet if for two weeks
you didn't lose any weight let's say or
you did
and you're like okay two weeks indicates
that this happened
and the scientist in you was like scale
is only accurate to a pound
i can't actually tell if i'm on track
because the scale is just not accurate
to my own goals
for a pound in two weeks scaling
actually can't tell me anything
so you have to wait for four weeks to
get anything meaningful out of the scale
geez
imagine if you're accidentally you know
you set your your
fat loss calories but let's say you're
at a maintenance let's say you're
accidentally at a slight surplus
you could have spent four weeks gaining
a pound and only after four weeks would
you realize that that was the case
you literally just didn't do any fat
loss at all
for one month and look if you've got a
trip coming up four or five months later
you just pissed away a month losing no
fat like that sucks right and
forget about the trip you said you were
on a fat loss phase probably a good idea
to get right into it right so we got a
pretty big tracking problem
if even per month you lose just a couple
pounds then you know you just
body weight water fluctuations and stuff
like that you know
some weeks uh for females this applies a
ton you know weeks of
you know during the menstrual cycle
weeks off and so on and so forth there's
so much variability there
that if you integrate all that and the
fact that you might have eaten more
salty foods this past week you're under
less stress or more stress than usual
that's a couple pounds up and down the
scale anyway if your week to week to
week goals are so small that they get
either they never so there's this
bandwidth right
it's up and down and up and down and up
and down and just random chance and
salty foods and periods and all this
other stuff
and that's a band of you know like oh a
couple percent
around your weight right and let's say
your weight's going like this and here's
this band
you know if you're here here here here
here here you can't tell where you are
because it's just not accurate enough so
if we have the line go down pretty
sharply a faster loss rate
if you're actually maintaining you get a
quicker separation of the two like yeah
if you're here and here you don't know
but
two three weeks later you're here you're
supposed to be here the band ends before
your weight
that's good but because the band has a
certain thickness
we have to exit that thickness at some
point right it's like if you have um
a freeway that's four lanes long
like when it splits up your gps can't
tell if you
made the split until like 200 feet after
and it's like oh hey you didn't take
this exit you're like shit
that's 18 minutes out of the way the
next exit's like down you know 10 blocks
or something
but if the freeway let's say if your gps
you know was accurate to only within a
mile uh
when would it tell you you're off track
geez you would be like oh we're going to
florida this is great and then five
minutes later it's like hey guess what
you've been on the wrong freeway for
five whole minutes you're like oh my god
we really
we had an exit back there we could have
taken bad news right
so basically tracking problems a big
deal so
anything slower than point five percent
per week gets us into tracking problem
territory
not the best use of our time next one
number two is actually kind of like a
really interesting point
um we actually just lose much more fat
with faster rates
i know that sounds like a non-point but
it's almost like
you know if you thought you've come up
with some kind of brilliant idea and a
childlike question
can just house of cards the thing you
don't have a brilliant idea
right uh so if if someone if you say to
someone hey i'm losing
fat at 0.5 per week and someone's like
why don't you do 0.75 and you're like
well why would i and they're like well
you just lose fat faster you're like
but no uh oh yeah shit i would
right you just plan to lose fat faster
why not go faster if you can
it's like uh here's the perfect analogy
for that
speed limit on the freeway 70 miles an
hour you want to be safe so you're going
to go 65 you don't want to go 70 fine
but you pass someone who's doing 30
miles an hour and let's say that the
collision problem's not a problem like
going slow on the freeway let's just
dedicated lanes and one of them is like
oh slow as you want
right why would you go 30 miles an hour
if you're really quite safe up to 65
we're not saying go 90
but if you're really quite safe up to 65
miles an hour and you're a really good
driver you're really experienced shit
you have a roll cage in your car
why are you going 30 it's a very
difficult question to answer a lot of
people like well better safe than sorry
safe for what and they're like oh isn't
it bad to go faster well yeah but that's
that's the next slide
past one percent but between point five
and one percent
gee i mean just more faster rate it's
just more fat loss so you're gonna have
to have a good reason for going below
0.5
right number three uh
yes there's a risk to muscle loss that
is definitely a problem
right um but that really is a problem
over one percent per week so if you try
to lose more than two pounds per week as
a 200 pound person
you're starting to get into that
territory or muscle loss risk as a
discussion
if it's less than percent which is way
more than 0.5
uh muscle loss risk is really just not a
thing with a reasonable program
so it's again coming back to the car
analogy you could say well i could get
into a really serious
you know i could veer off the road at 65
miles an hour
and you know a professional race car
driver because you know like with your
car at 90 miles an hour we could start
to talk about
that kind of risk you know on these
turns but at 65 g
you just have to do something just it
would just have to be the worst luck
ever or something like that
and it's just really not likely you know
and you have a great car
four-wheel drive guide assist steering
or whatever
it's just not an issue right so it's not
a so people say i don't want to lose fat
too fast i want to lose muscle
up until one percent per week or so
that's just not a concern so again a
pretty good argument against losing too
slow
and uh lastly is a more of a phase of
concern which we'll address
in another lecture i think in the next
one if you lose fat
faster not too crazy fast but at a good
pace that's 65 miles an hour analogy
and you maintain and recover uh you know
maintain the new fat loss so you come
down you maintain
you recover all your physiology which
we'll talk about later and
then you repeat another loss you get a
bigger change in your total fat loss
over time than if you just go
super slow the entire time and at the
end of that you're exhausted anyway so
you still need to do a maintenance phase
here's a really good analogy of that
we're just getting really good patting
myself on the back
um here's the same car analogy applied
to that
if you are driving from new york to
chicago
okay uh road trip with friends
do you go 65 miles an hour and or do you
go 30 miles an hour
all right if you go 65 miles an hour
you get from new york to chicago and
roughly a day of travel
whole day putting whatever like 13 hours
but you know you leave early in the
morning and you get there and you have a
nights of rest and you have like
multiple days
you know in chicago exploring the city
and doing fun stuff going to music
festival and getting in the car and
coming back and going to new york right
let's say you play it super safe and go
30 miles an hour
you know that turns the car ride into
a two-day affair
that's going to suck time away from
other things it's going to straight up
make the trip
longer or the fun shorter and also it
carries its own
independent fatigue of just being in the
car that long now here's the good news
at any one point you're not under as
much stress if you're driving 30 miles
an hour down country roads
you can bs with your friends you can
look this way that way who cares we get
an accident at 30 miles an hour not much
happens anyway people are just
it's unfortunate your car's broken or
whatever not no one's going to be dying
but it's it's so at 65 miles an hour
you're going to keep your eyes on the
road and stuff like that
but at 65 you get in you get it done you
have fun and you're golden
right and it's stressful but it's not so
stressful the thing is
if you go needlessly slow it just makes
the diet last like forever
and then it's just a really poor
efficiency so it's just
like with many things in life it's good
to get in
just do good diligent work not too fast
not too slow
get it done and then relax and do
whatever else you have to do just get in
and get it done versus just taken
forever
for no clearly good reason now on the
other hand
when people say that they want to lose
really slow they have a point because
sometimes you can lose too
fast how does that work well let's say
we decide
when you stopped listening after the too
slow slide and you're like people going
30 miles an hour whatever i'm gonna go
90
right so you decide to lose fat super
fast much more than
or one percent body weight per week so
let's say you decide to go 1.5
which for a 200 pound person would be
roughly 3 pounds per week
lost what are some downsides there are a
lot
first you got to eat way less food
because you got to cut more calories to
get that kind of weight loss
and that means you get radical hunger
much quicker
and increase stress much quicker those
things
will cause problems for diet rebound
later
they'll increase the chance of you
failing the diet sooner or sooner
uh even sooner than you had planned
because you'd lose quite a bit of weight
by then but maybe not even as much as
you wanted
but those are very very valid concerns
but there's just another concern which
we don't even have to talk about those
yet
um radical hunger is just bad it's
annoying
if you could lose really good amounts of
weight in a sustainable fashion and not
ever experience radical hunger
like wouldn't that be good and and
stressed like you want to be stressed no
can you imagine like you're like hey
yeah i tried to lose fat for eight weeks
three percent a week i got through six
weeks lost a good bit of fat but it
burned out and was
the whole diet was miserable was awful i
never want to do it again
and you look at your co-worker and he's
like yeah you know like six weeks into
my one percent per week diet or 0.75 per
week diet
and you're like oh man must be hungry
huh they're like no i feel great my
workouts are great i'm not hungry at all
like i gotta have like a couple pieces
of pizza extra but man i got you know
six more weeks of this diet i'm gonna
rock it no problem
and you're like but they're just having
an easier time
you literally just chose to have a
harder time it's it's almost like
trying to go on a road trip and getting
a radar detector radar jammer in your
car and going like 135 miles an hour the
entire time weaving in and out of
traffic
someone's going to be like so you got to
chicago in like six hours
how do you feel and you're like uh
you're like white knuckling the ride
you're like i don't know man i feel like
i'm gonna have a heart attack like we
almost killed ourselves back there like
is that really worth it like
maybe not maybe we could it's not a road
trip anymore how much how many
conversations you're gonna have with
the four friends you have in the car
when you're like the freeways like right
angles that third one you know
everything feels crazy at 130 miles an
hour
yeah it's just no fun right and
especially if you're somebody who
coaches clients or something like that
helps other people with their fitness
jamming them in at like one and a half
percent and faster per week
it's just gonna lead to a lot of burnout
just from the fact that the stuff sucks
not even that it causes a burnout later
that it just
as a memory of having done the cut or
the fat loss phase you're gonna be like
i don't like hunger i don't like stress
this was dumb i'm never going to do it
again
second point a lot of potential to lose
muscle right
the further you get away from this one
percent the more muscle losses reality
at two percent you lose significant
amounts of muscle
you lose a lot of muscle you lose your
shape you lose your performance you lose
significant health
it's all bad i don't have to go down
that road for you guys
number three your metabolism declines a
little bit when you go really really
hard
but you're not exercise activity
thermogenesis you're neat how much you
just move and fidget throughout the day
how many calories you burn goes down a
ton with that ends up happening
what ends up resulting from that is you
cut your calories significant amount
to get to the one and a half percent or
whatever per week weight loss
several weeks later your metabolism dips
just a tiny bit
and your energy expenditure dips
way more you have to dip your calories
that much further to keep
that fast rate up at some point that
sort of builds on itself and it results
in you eating very very few calories
for an impressive fat loss rate but the
level of calorie consumption is
super super super uh low
which magnifies radical hunger and
stress even more than the traditional
model
would expect so for example you can look
at run the numbers say i've got a
maintenance at 4 000 calories
fine and in order to drop a one and a
half percent i'll have to eat at
2 000 calories or i'll have to eat at
2500.
that's fine i've done that before it's
fine the thing is like yeah if your
metabolism
and your energy expenditure didn't
adjust that would be the case
a couple weeks later they start
adjusting and all of a sudden you have
to eat not 2500 calories but 2200
calories to maintain that rate of weight
loss you projected
then you have to eat 2000 calories then
you have to eat 1800 calories this stuff
can dip a ton
1800 calories that's yeah you signed up
for radical hunger already at 2500 if
your baseline is 4 000
at 1800 you're peeling your eyes out and
trying to eat them
so it's really really really bad leads
to that
hunger and radical stress and a really
nasty feedback loop bad idea
right so even on paper so to speak with
a very incomplete theory
it's already hard to diet at those rates
but if you try to apply it
your activity and your metabolism fall
so much it gets even harder even harder
even harder
and another thing is the leaner and
leaner you get
the ratio of muscle loss to fat loss
gets worse and worse
so you might if you start at 25 fat you
go down to 20
you might be able to rock a one plus
body fat percent per week loss and
be okay or body weight per week and be
just fine not lose any muscle
if you diet from 20 to 15 percent you
might like you know
kind of lose a little bit if you die
from 15 to 10 percent you might lose
quite a bit
if you try to diet from 10 to show
conditioning
uh at that rapidity which i basically
know no one who's ever tried that
you're gonna lose a ton of muscle and
just be hormonally all messed up and
look like crap so
basically especially if you're an
athlete if you're lean
these super fast percentages are
completely off limits for you
and as far as the fifth one you know
training performance if you're at that
big of a calorie deficit
your body's just trying to survive at
that point forget about good training
your performance deteriorates of course
with that if it's your hypertrophy
training muscle loss results
your hormones get really wacky your
cortisol starts to go up
at that point you start holding body
water because of stress hormones like
cortisol
and you can't even tell if you're on
track anymore because your weight loss
has stalled and you don't look any
better because you're puffy
bad news because then you try to cut
more calories and leads to even more of
the same problems
real bad news your health starts to be
not so great
potentially if you take this process to
an extreme all these things go
south in your testosterone falls which
means more muscle loss
bad deal starving yourself into leanness
is not the most effective way to do
things and it burns itself
out and speaking of burning yourself out
even if you survive
and you finish and you accomplish your
goals
that mega approach to dieting means a
mega chance for
rebounding if you've gone a moderate
pace diet at the end of the diet you're
like oh i could eat some tasty foods
you start eating normally again mostly
healthy foods you have a couple cheat
meals a couple weeks later you're like
wow i feel great i don't have any crazy
cravings and i'm leaner and this is
awesome there's no rebound really or
just a couple pounds
if you crash a diet you're gonna get so
crazy hungry and so
out of your mind that your chances for
rebounding and eating everything
go sky high and your body's ability to
gain
fat is gee it's almost limitless as far
as
rate is concerned some of our colleagues
i believe meadow henselman's
has reported a story of one of his
former clients who gained
something on the order of
i don't want to misquote the figure
maybe five pounds of
body fat in a week after doing a
bodybuilding show
and this guy ate everything he ate
everything he could
but you know it takes a long time to
lose five pounds of fat
if you can gain it back in a week and
then gain another four pounds in the
next then another three pounds the next
i have seen numerous people reverse four
months of hard dieting
in roughly a month of binge eating the
way they did that was they tried to burn
way too fast so best idea
let's see where we end up in the middle
here best loss rates
quick review can you lose at a slower
rate
than half a percent per week yeah but
you'll have to explain
why there have to be good reasons that
obviate some of the conditions we've
discussed earlier
can you lose at a rate faster than one
percent body weight per week
also yes but again there have to be some
pretty good reasons as to why
right there are cases situations
in which that definitely is the case but
it's at face value you're gonna have to
prove it
right as far as recommendations
if an individual is prone to rapid fat
loss with minimal muscle loss risk like
you could lose fat easily and you don't
really lose muscle based on previous
experience
you can start closer to that one percent
figure no problem
if somebody you're working with or
yourself loses fat pretty easily but
also loses muscle easily you want to
start closer to 0.5 percent to conserve
as much muscle as possible because if
fat loss isn't that hard but if you lose
a bunch of muscle with it you're kind of
back to square one
for individuals who don't lose fat
easily
or lose muscle easily they just tend to
retain starting closer to one percent is
again probably a good idea because
you're real good stimulus for that fat
loss and since muscle loss is not much a
concern
no big deal if you struggle with both
okay you don't lose fat easily
but you lose muscle easily you probably
want to split the difference
somewhere between point five and one
percent and choose whatever is best for
your adherence
if it's a plan you can stick to that's
going to be nine times out of ten what's
going to work for you in the long term
all right switching gears we talked
about rates
let's talk about durations let's say
we wanted to lose fat for only a few
weeks
two weeks three weeks something like
that
what are the problems with that well
it's not the worst thing in the world
but it has some downsides
first if you're trying to lose fat in a
more permanent sense which
most people are like trying to not be
fat anymore trying to get lean so you
can sort of keep the weight off
you're concerned with something called
your settling point right which is what
your body thinks it should weigh in the
amount of fat it thinks it should have
so to speak physiologically
and your settling point is roughly at
around a certain number
and if you really move your settling
point down
sort of where your body weight and fat
level is
enough the actual settling point if you
move your weight down
enough your settling point over a while
will shift down and meet you sort of
in that area but if you weigh 200 pounds
and you go down to 195 your settling
point might not shift at all or might go
down to like 197
and then you go back you have a few bad
weekends so to speak a few off weekends
and you're just back at 200 you
basically just didn't move the needle
enough
to accomplish anything long-term
sticky sustainable right it's like if
you're
uh if you have a dog that comes to you
when you call him um but generally stays
within like 50 feet of you right and
you're walking outside with your dog and
let's say you're in a big field
your dog's getting into some shit or
something you know dogs get started
rubbing around and some some other dogs
crap and you're like oh my god
let's say you want to get him away from
that and he follows you reliably but
he's got a 50-foot area
if you move 25 feet away from the pile
of shit
you're gonna be like oh all right he's
out of the shit he's gonna follow you
for 25 feet then what's he gonna do he's
gonna roam around roam around roam
around filing pile of shit again still
within 50 feet he's good
and he's just going to start doing it
again you're like oh my god this is
terrible
so your movement was kind of a waste
because it wasn't far enough to pull the
dog
temp permanently away from that area
like a settling point
but look if there's a pile of shit right
here and you move 200 feet away and
you're like fido wolfie
all right where what dog names we got
uh i ran i ran aground with fido and
wolfy that's it
barky i don't know that's kind of kind
of out of favor
so you know you call your dog over 200
feet away and you know hot dogs oh huh
he was eating shit or whatever and he
perks up oh my god
my owner he'd run super fast and when he
gets to you
he's got that 50-foot rule like he
doesn't ever travel too far
and all of a sudden the pile of shit's
like way out of his memory and
who knows how much short-term memory
dogs even have right and
uh he's just doing other stuff and
you're like okay this was enough
distance from the pile of shit to
actually matter so if you
like if you say to yourself like i'm
going to diet for two weeks and then
take a break
like you just didn't move the needle
farther for your body to be like all
right now we're really just lower now
good it's just like man and it comes
back up so that's point number one
right so if you want long-term weight
reduction
you got to move the needle pretty far
we'll talk about how far into a little
bit
uh next one you might not even be able
to confirm that you lost that weight
so if you lose one pound a week
for two weeks you lost two pounds
how do you know you lost two pounds
let's say the scale normally has you at
you know 205 203
207 201 206
203 203.5 like that's what your average
week looks like so you like weigh about
204 or something
if you lose 2 pounds what are the
averages 201
204 205 203
202 201 201 it looks damn near the same
and if there's any kind of body water
shift you eating a couple more days of
that week that second
week or even two weeks after you just
had a little bit too much soy sauce in
your sushi
looks like looks like the other week
looks the same so if you diet for just
two weeks
you can't actually confirm to yourself
that you have in fact
moved the needle so it's not just the
needle hasn't moved far from point
number one
it's that you don't even sure if you
move the needle right i don't know
imagine it's one of these like uh like
the 1950s horror movies and you have to
turn this crank
to turn the uh you know the boiler off
and it's like it's like 800 it's bad
it's in the red and then 600 is good and
your friends get free or whatever
and the boiler needle is going like this
like if you do like two revolutions and
the boiler needle's still like this
you're like i don't know i guess it
turned
maybe it's a needle who knows right you
really give it a couple of cranks
and then it goes to 700 you're like all
right i'm going in the right direction
right because you could be cranking it
wrong the whole time and it could just
be going up who knows right
so you got to take enough time to make
sure
stuff's actually happening point number
three
a lot of times when you lose fat
specifically if it's your first time
or if it's your first serious time
there's kind of a lifestyle shift
that happens with that and it can be
pretty radical
like you know used to eating some junk
and now you're eating more healthy foods
you're measuring your meals you're
timing it out
if it's just for like two weeks or even
just four weeks
you're still getting the hang of it and
all of a sudden your diet's over
and you're like okay so you learn
nothing you have no ingrained good
habits
you go right back to your own way of
doing things and you well like
predictably probably will just
gain the weight back and it'll be for
nothing but
if you diet for 12 weeks even eight
weeks
gee you get into the flow of things and
after you're done with the diet and your
coach says hey listen
um try to keep eating these whole food
meals with protein in them
you're gonna that's gonna mean something
to you and you're gonna have all these
great habits about
how to go through your day picking those
foods making those foods
and everything's gold so again
if we just diet you for a real short
time it's not enough for those good
lifestyle changes to settle in
right and number four again are
childlike questions
to beat down our supposed genius why
only lose for such a small amount of
time
if there's just no downside to losing
more now of course
this is like uh the the car question
right
uh you know uh someone says oh
okay i want to get from new york to
chicago
and uh you know it's like let's say 900
miles of driving
i think we can drive 900 miles in a day
for sure but
let's let's only drive 300 miles per day
like okay why
well you know um
yeah i don't know you're like okay so
let's say we go 65 miles an hour a
couple hours and we've done it we have
like the whole rest of the day to kick
cans around or
look in rural pennsylvania wherever the
hell you end up
which you know nobody wants to end up in
rural pennsylvania run
help right so it's one of the situations
where somebody could be like hey why
didn't you drive further and you could
be like wow
gee i don't know i have no idea right
sometimes you send you know you you plot
out your road trip and you spend you're
like oh yeah st louis looks really far
away
you get to st louis by 2 p.m and
everyone's like dude we can just keep
going and they're like wow i guess we
can right so
if you diet for a month you do
everything properly so
you'll be like i'm done dieting
someone's like okay it's like why are
you
done now you're like well cause um yeah
i actually have no good idea and and
here's another big
real take-home point from number four
why losers only smile
uh such a small amount if there's no
downside to losing more it goes back
into the lifestyle thing
once you are into the lifestyle after
about a month or a couple of weeks
you're really getting the hang of it
you're building momentum right there's a
momentum not a physical momentum but a
psychological momentum a process
momentum a
habitual momentum of just like just
going to the gym
i've got my work schedule i'm packing my
meals i'm losing weight i know my body i
figured out my macros that work for me
in my diet that's getting me that
you know 0.75 per week loss i'm grooving
why stop a good groove you're losing fat
like crazy
it's almost like you know you're like
like i don't know you're partying with
your friends and you're at a specific
party and everyone's having a good time
like amazing and you wanted to hit up a
couple other parties maybe that night
but like no one's special no one to see
it's just great music great friends
super fun are you going to be the person
be like all right guys let's move on to
the next party like
but this party's awesome like yeah but
we could walk through the snow for 10
minutes to go nowhere at a party that's
already canceled or like right good
point
like once you get the groove have fun do
it up there's no downside
to go for a considerable length of time
same thing for dieting
once you get into the hang of it it's
funny because a lot of times
people will schedule with their coaches
or nutritionists or whatever they're
saying
i'll die for six weeks that's all i can
handle nutrition is like okay and at
week five they're like hey
i can can i just keep going a lot of
times the nutritionist is like oh your
numbers look good you're not fatigued
let's do it right so a lot of times
these super short diets
the it's not just that you could have
kept going
it's that because of momentum the kept
going stuff is
easier in in a sense um what's another
quick analogy
it's almost like this if you're working
productively
and you're not tired and you're about to
finish a big project and then you can
just relax don't go home for lunch and
take a nap
like you know when you get to work and
you're at work and you're typing stuff
up and charting stuff up on the board
and you're like
man boom we're crushing this proposal
and someone's like dude like another two
hours of work we'll get this done and
you're like yeah but it is five o'clock
we could just finish it tomorrow you
come in tomorrow you just slept a night
brain fog you know somebody yelled at
you on your way to work you
pick up and you're like oh i got these
notes and you have to rebuild that
momentum of grooving with the work and
then sort of
halfway through an hour left you spent
two hours because of the shitty momentum
now you're grooving and as soon as you
start the groove you're done like why
did we even why didn't we just stay till
7 pm last night
same idea with dieting so losing for too
short
has its downsides but losing for too
long has downsides as well let's talk
about those so let's say you lose
for much longer than three months so
like four months five months six months
plus that kind of situation
first the hypocaloric condition
not having enough calories is inherently
a restrictive condition
it is inherently a difficult condition
it is inherently a condition that needs
a
physiological break because various
hormones
and other body mechanisms cannot be
starved in a literal sense
deprived for very long at three months
you're totally cool
at four months your body's going to
start to rebel against you at five six
seven months etcetera
things are going to go way way south
you're going to be chronically over
dieted
your hormones are going to be all crazy
you're not going to be losing fat as
fast you're not going to be losing
muscle
your body needs a reset
in addition to that point number two
it's not just a physical reset but a
psychological one
a thing about dieting that's very
interesting is
hypocaloric dieting by definition
is restrictive right people will say
well
if you just do if it's your macros count
macros
and you can eat any foods you want it's
not restrictive uh-huh it's not
restrictive how many how many grams of
carbs you get today like 350 can you do
351 they're like no
that's not restrictive to you counting
by the gram is not restrictive to you
you got to count everything up in a
little ledger that's not restrictive of
course it's restricted
and if you can eat as much food as you
want you have to limit yourself to the
quote-unquote clean foods that are super
low calorie dense high volume and then
you're like someone's like hey do you
want a cookie and you're like i can't
have cookies
why not like i'm just eating broccoli
and celery but i get as many of my
as i want you know said no whatever so
dieting
hypocalorically is inherently a
psychologically burdensome thing
not to risk making a bit of a crude
analogy it doesn't matter
how much space they give you and how
many visitors you get and how good the
meals are in jail
you're still in jail right and it uh
you know even you know let's say you're
in a prisoner of war camp and it's
announced that you'll be traded for
other prisoners and the war is over uh
you know but that's gonna be happening
in two weeks
that's two weeks you're still in a
prisoner of war camp and you might be
more cheery but you're still there
just the same way in a diet the fact
that you're in a diet
is burdensome the fact that you're not
in a maintenance phase is burdensome
and it leaches out on you even if it's
an easier diet you could say well i
only lose 0.5 or even less percent per
week
doesn't feel like a diet it is a diet it
is restrictive psychologically because
of a fundamental fact
you show up to a restaurant you show up
to a store and you say i want to eat
that
you have to go through at least a couple
of logical operations to vet that
process
when you're on a maintenance phase and
you're totally cool and you're having a
cheat meal you can literally just show
up you're like cheat meal time
like what can you have i can have
whatever i want you go to the store you
go boom i want that and you just haven't
okay
loaf of bread or whatever raw ham
something crazy right um you can have it
and that is such a
freeing experience that it's completely
different and it drops psychological
fatigue like you wouldn't believe
but even if you're on a pretty
non-restrictive diet
there is some calculation to be like hey
what do you want like oh i can
i don't know ah i can't really fit that
in that's a problem
right so you need a break every now and
again it's not every two months
not every month every three months plus
maybe it's time for a break
uh of course very straightforward muscle
loss risk
goes up significantly if you die for too
long mostly because you skipped your
break from number one
and um performance is going to risk
going down as well
so you lose muscle you lose performance
it's not so clear why you're dieting
anymore anyway and uh all of these
things put together
going longer and longer especially that
psychological break lack the increasing
hunger so on and so forth
going much longer creates the conditions
for a rebound
right if you diet for three months and
you feel like oh
that was great glad i'm not dieting
anymore you don't have an almost no
rebound whatsoever you feel super
right you lose like eight percent of
your body weight then you're totally
good uh
you go for six months you're gonna be so
unbelievably over the concept of dieting
when you're done
your chance for burnout and just as soon
as that is over eating
your feelings and the world along with
it super high lots of rebound
you just did like the two stupidest
things you could have you dyed it for
way too long
and you pissed away half that diet just
on the rebound why not just diet for
half as long and piss away nothing
it makes a lot more sense so with that
said what are the best
lost durations um if you're losing for
two weeks or less
on a fat loss phase it's very
speculative like you have to have a very
good reason for doing that
there are usually no good reasons for
doing that
loss phases of up to six months are okay
for beginners
and that's mostly via lifestyle change
in an introduction
to training uh introduction to good diet
so it's nearly effortless what does that
mean
someone can start completely untrained
and pretty overweight they drink a
regular sugar soda they don't work out
and they don't eat any healthy food
really except for stuff they randomly
bump into
they start eating 75 of their food as
like you know
veggies fruits whole grains lean meats
healthy fats
they cut all soda out uh go to diet soda
and they just feel like more full than
they felt before
more energized not remotely restricted
they have a couple of bs junk items uh
here and there
and uh they are losing like pounds and
pounds of weight per week right and they
start off super obese so it's like
that doesn't even count as there's no
psychological uh
cost to that whatsoever barely any
physiological cost so you can go
nearly effortless they start exercising
a bit and lifting weights
again effortless gaining muscle at the
same time losing tons of fat
that's for three months for another
three months they have to sort of grind
it a little bit more they start feeling
a little restriction a little bit more
six months no problem they lose a ton of
weight then they maintain that's fine
for folks that aren't new to the process
three months or so
is a good cap to just be on the safe
side can you die for four months and
survive yes
are a good significant minority people
not going to survive that process
yeah so there's no guarantees
on the other hand one month loss phases
can work especially if you're an athlete
that's constrained to a certain time
horizon for example in three months you
have a meet
for powerlifting you have this one month
to do higher volume training
and that's the only time you can
actually lose fat because then it
interferes with meat prep
and you're over by two kilos for your
weight class so you lose half a kilo a
week for four weeks
i think that's totally cool right but
that's um probably
uh as a non-athlete if you literally if
you
insist on one month uh you'd have to
have some real good uh
scheduling uh constraints like i say
okay i gotta die for a month
because then i go to europe for a
business meeting for a week and then i'm
going to come back and
take a maintenance phase and then die
for another six weeks and then i have to
go to asia for a business meeting so on
and so forth
fine fine right but um if you have like
three months to kill
and you're dieting for a month uh
curious why you're doing that so
generally speaking two to three months
of continual dieting
probably best especially when you take
into that account the momentum
right if you can build some good dieting
momentum here's the thing
on a percent basis two or three months
of dieting that's of anywhere from a
four to a twelve percent
uh weight loss right um
that's no laughing matter so sometimes
people think oh man two or three months
of dieting like
that's not enough right three months of
strict dieting at roughly one percent
body weight loss per month is 12 of
weight loss that is
huge like if you weigh roughly 200
pounds
that's 24 or 25 pounds that's a dear
different person
right if you're 300 pounds geez that's

people like well i'm 300 i want to get

overnight we're going to talk about that
in diet prioritization later on
so 4 12 percent is still a lot
if you go on the high end for four-ish
months or so
you want to opt for the slower rates
closer to 0.5 percent per week just to
make sure you're not burning yourself
out
and um if you're on the low end
you can go a little faster so if you
keep your
per phase net loss just something like
eight percent
body weight maybe ten percent body
weight or so that's probably the best in
most cases
trying to push for twelve percent or
fourteen percent loss
per fat loss phase probably too much for
most and going slower
was almost never a bad thing so long as
you're not going needlessly slow
that's all we have for this one fat loss
periodization
