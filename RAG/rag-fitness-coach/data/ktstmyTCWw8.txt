hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and on today's episode of
BS I'd say the whole thing but YouTube
doesn't like me swearing in the
beginning of the algorithm for the
algorithm rather high protein diets are
bad for your health
don't eat them you'll have bad Health if
you do
a lot of times this is just said really
straightforwardly
you maybe tell your parents or your
parents friend or your aunt Susie well
I'm eating a lot of protein because I
want to build muscle and so I can have
more friends
and she will say well that I think
that's bad for you isn't high protein
bad for you and it's something that a
lot of moms especially are really
concerned with their teen sons start to
pick up the old creatine and protein and
weights and try to get buff in high
school
maybe some kind of old school doctors in
their corner from 1955 when he got his
medical education they say protein extra
protein is bad for you you don't want to
eat it let's find out if this is true
in order to find out if this is true we
have to go to the claims and get a one
layer deeper to ask just one question
why or how how is excess protein bad for
you how are high protein diets bad for
you
a lot of times the answer involves the
kidneys and it's usually just a one-word
answer like kidneys
guess the kidneys do exist go on you'll
almost never hear them go on after
because most people who say protein is
bad for health just don't know anything
after that they might be able to you
know chat GPT style make up an answer
like well the kidneys process
protein and you can overwhelm them yes
with too much protein that's a fine
claim to stick in the ground and see if
it stands up another candidate organ is
just not that many organs in the body I
don't know that many so we'll say liver
this one you hear a lot well what the
liver
it's bad for the liver and then you get
the identical answer if you ask any
further well if you deliver
processes not sure how protein and you
can overwhelm deliver with too much
protein and then the liver is like
what are you doing to me you're killing
me I'm Jersey liver
the proteins are in me I'm dying
that's exactly how liver Sound by the
way another thing you might hear from
the more astute podcast listeners of all
Stripes is mtor and protein activates
that longevity may be a problem they may
actually be onto some tiny little bit of
Truth we'll get that in a second and of
course last one as well
my nurse my nurse practitioner or my
doctor told me
and while you should listen to medical
staff getting a second opinion and a bit
of skepticism is probably good for
almost everyone so
what is the reality first straight up
if you have healthy kidneys which you
would know by just going to the doctor
once a year getting a regular checkup
getting normal blood work that the
doctor should order for you in a checkup
if the doctor is like everything looks
good you can assume your kidneys are
totally fine
there is actually no realistic amount of
protein that you could eat that is
unhealthy you could make almost your
entire diet protein for weeks on end and
yes they have tried that in a laboratory
and it doesn't strain the kidneys
they're really great at doing their job
and there's two of them so they're super
powerful now if you have kidney disease
or dysfunction of any kind talk to your
doctor about how much protein you should
be eating the good news is they probably
already talked to you and then you're a
special case and this video does not
apply to you but almost everyone 99.9 of
people have perfectly normal kidneys and
they can eat as much protein as they
want does that mean you have to eat a
ton of protein no does that needle won't
make your farts and poops make friends
partners and spouses spikes spaces leave
you well yeah no no leave the out
of you you'll be awful but it's not
going to hurt your health
this is confirmed in study after study
it is essentially Bedrock foundational
medical knowledge at this point and your
doctor thinks otherwise is just out of
date there's just no other way to say
that
your body is super resilient and can be
healthy with really different intakes of
various macronutrients including protein
so it's nothing to worry about
what about the liver that's just make
belief nonsense somebody just made that
up
the way to overwhelm your liver by
eating too much protein is not even
biochemically obvious uh to me at all I
don't know maybe you guys have some
suggestions in the comments how that
could happen oh preemptu was saying that
the direct studies show it doesn't
happen so enjoy hypothesizing to Nowhere
what about longevity
it is probably true that a diet slightly
lower in protein than what would make
you maximally jacked does increase by
some small margin long-term lifespan of
any individual right marginal benefits
for marginal trade-offs right but
is that worth it to you maybe if you're
in your 60s and 70s and you really want
to optimize for longevity I wouldn't get
super jacked I would be lean and fit and
healthy and active but eat on the normal
amount of protein that a human being is
supposed to eat maybe just a little bit
more than that to get a little bit extra
jacked nothing like a gram per pound
maybe 0.6 or 0.7 grams per pound per day
and if you want to know about kilos
just type it into a calculator damn it
I don't want to be too uh too mean to
our European friends
Asian friends and African friends and I
guess America is the only place that
uses hounds Canadian friends Mexican
friends
I digress
lastly
if we have accounted for all those
things
the vast majority of people that hate on
protein and say too much protein is bad
for you are doing one of two things
one
is making something up or two is just
repeating something somebody else made
up
and
they're probably not training with
weights and they're small they're just
not jacked which how do you go through
your life being not jacked the answer is
perfectly normally but also go eat your
protein get jacked and enjoy and you're
paying at some level a tiny longevity
cost perhaps and that's all trade-offs
based on you
seeing that too much protein is just
straight up bad for your health is
