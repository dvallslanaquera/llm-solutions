yo youtube what's up i'm as usual
unfortunately dr mike that's jared jared
has two things bronchitis unless he's
unable to speak and no microphone thus
you will be unable to hear him entirely
he's gonna be in the mix in the back and
forth you know creeping around watching
the boys train few tips a lot of sexual
harassment that's how we like to keep
that ratio
this is pete this is jack they are
gigantic super strong people and they're
tired tired tired of walking every day
they have to walk places and they can't
simply say but my legs don't work but
after this workout they're going to have
the ultimate excuse fellas you're
welcome how do you feel before it all
starts i'm hyped i'm ready to go yeah

the first time i've ever thrown up in
training

get it done
[Music]
all right folks these are actually
clients of jared's
and they're going to be doing lying like
curls first multiple sets of 10 to 20
reps watch the technique watch the
intensity and then after that they are
doing leg press and after that they are
doing squat now here's the thing these
aren't first timers they've been doing
this exact program
for an entire mesa cycle up to this
they're well trained they're ready
however
your boy hasn't been in the mix to
sprinkle his own little brand of
bullshit in the mix we're gonna add a
few mile reps to the situation we're
gonna yell at them a little bit and when
the camera's here motherfuckers work a
little bit harder let's get started
on the pad it's going to extend the
range of motion at the bottom it's going
to fuck you in the ass

a couple sets of squats probably in the
five to ten rep range
and then
one little trick at the end
as always
let's do it i'm skipping the warm-up but
there's 135 i'm just going to trade 235
why just because
i i need that time i think like my quads
i can't even it will help you i think
you will if you just do maybe five
bodyweight squats right here even if you
just do that okay
stay upright
yep
you got this there you go
i told you yeah that's where they're at
take a break lay down relax yeah
he needs a few minutes did you get that
failure to warm up that's what you did
last time
you guys will notice that for some of
these squats the guys are using the
prime 10 degree wedge even with
weightlifting shoes if you have ankle
mobility trouble it can let you stay
super upright and let your knees come
really far over your toes and expose
your quads to a shitload of tension it's
a great thing
