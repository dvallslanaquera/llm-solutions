folks
is it good to have you with me dr james
hoffman here
welcome to another segment of our
hypertrophy training scientific
principles video series
i'm glad you're here i'm glad we're
going to be talking today
so at this point if you haven't watched
some of our previous videos
on the scientific principles of
hypertrophy training make sure you go
back and take a look at those because i
think they'll be really
useful for you some of the things that
i'm going to be talking about today
already include some of those elements
in there so you might be listening to me
going what the heck is he talking about
so if you find yourself in that position
go ahead go back through our youtube
channel
and watch some of the previous
installments because i think it'll help
you out
a whole bunch now as you guys have
probably learned
hypertrophy training really really
interesting topic some of you might be
looking at this going
who the is this guy who is he is
this dr mike
no i'm not dr mike i get confused with
dr mike all the time for some reason
i am dr james hoffman for those of you
who do know me
you probably have figured out i'm here
for a pretty specific purpose
and i'm usually more into the sport
training side of things so
you guys have learned a lot about
hypertrophy training up to this point
and i'm going to help you guys learn
how to incorporate some of those
elements into a good sport training
program
i mean how many things have we learned
about to this point you guys have talked
about all the principles
right with dr mike we've introduced new
things
like sfr which is really important we've
looked at things like set progression
algorithms and things like that also
really important we've looked at the
volume landmarks things that we've
talked about
for a long time all sorts of cool little
nuanced ideas for hypertrophy training
so now we're going to take a look at
those things and say okay well
i know how to do hypertrophy training at
least theoretically i got a pretty good
idea of how that works
how do i incorporate that into some of
the other activities that i do maybe i
play sports maybe i do some other
recreational hobbies or things that i
enjoy
how do those things kind of melt
together hey voila
that's why i'm here so why don't we go
ahead and get into it i'm going to do a
screen share
hopefully it's not too wonky ah yeah
i don't know why it shrunk that thing
down but whatever we'll just roll with
it
[Music]
we'll get it going here there we go
looking much better all right folks so
the title of my talk today
is hypertrophy training for other sports
and activities and again this will be a
topic that is covered in our upcoming
book that covers all the scientific
principles of hypertrophy training
and this is just a segment of that book
and we hope you enjoy
so what are we going to be talking about
today the big things we're going to be
looking at are the differences between
training for physique and training for
sport now
most of you are probably thinking like
duh i kind of get that but there are
some really distinct differences that
are noteworthy and why we might make
some programming or kind of contextual
changes for those things
and i'm going to try and highlight the
ones that i think are really important
and then last i'm going to give you some
just kind of bullet points and some
important take-homes about how you
incorporate hypertrophy training
into sports and other activities and
this again is something that we cover
way more in our upcoming book but for
now why don't we get into it and have a
little chat
so as most of you probably know
hypertrophy training
pretty sweet right growing more muscle
getting bigger
when last time i did a video with chad i
did this like a hundred times and chad
still hasn't stopped making fun of me
for it so i'm resisting the urge
to do a front double bicep while i'm
talking but it might come up just don't
judge right it's going to pop up every
now and again let it go
so we know that growing muscle not only
is cool for vanity
but if you haven't figured it out by yet
it also can have a pretty significant
role
in increasing strength and power output
for sports
we can see right dude i love this video
it's so good right that's quite a stiff
arm get the out of here sit down
so we know that athletes who are really
muscular sometimes have a pretty good
one up in the strength and power
department than athletes who are less
muscular right
so we know that there are substantial
benefits to growing muscle mass
for all of sports and that's just not
for things like football and strength
and power sports we know that
believe it or not you need some muscle
to be good at endurance sports as well
you just need less of it but you still
need some good solid endurant muscle in
there so
we know that growing muscle in whatever
capacity is good for sporting outcomes
as well as for vanity and for funsies
right
so the question really is can we take
all that same cool things
that we learned so far about hypertrophy
training and directly just carry them
over
into trying to do hypertrophy training
for other sports
that's the big question so the problem
that we run into
is that the answer is kind of nuanced it
is yes to some degree
but not exactly in many others so we
always have to go back
to what i think is the most important
training principle and i think most of
you would agree
is specificity specificity is kind of
our first initial funnel
when we're looking at training right so
that we can just immediately eliminate
things that are totally garbage and
unrelated to what we're doing so
if we're looking at specificity of
training for physique training
this generally means we're trying to be
as lean and muscular as possible now
there's
certainly varying degrees of that if
you're just doing physique for fun like
you're just doing it because you want to
be fit and healthy
and maybe you don't want to be a
bodybuilder that's perfectly fine
you're trying to find that sweet spot of
how much fuss and effort you're putting
into it and
how much body composition improvement
you get out of it other people
maybe are trying to be more like
physique athletes bodybuilders for
example
and they're trying to achieve peak
levels of leanness and muscularity
most of us are maybe somewhere in the
middle where we're not really competing
but we're taking it more seriously than
just training for health you know etc
so for the most part though in a very
vague kind of just
superficial sense the specificity
constraint that we see for physique
training generally is just trying to
increase muscle mass
and decrease fat mass over time sport
training on the other hand
is much more constrained because we have
very very specific sporting outcomes
that we're trying to achieve
so the overarching goal is to of course
get better at whatever sport or fun
activities that we're doing
but then we break that down into little
sub components in areas like fitness
skills and tactics and we say okay which
of these things make me most successful
at sport or
increase my probability of success at
sport and how can i improve those things
right and so that's kind of where our
specificity funnel goes
it really doesn't kind of meld well with
the idea of always just trying to be as
big and lean as possible sometimes that
works
but in many cases it doesn't so we have
an immediate kind of constriction on
specificity right there
one thing we do know about training for
physique and hypertrophy training
is that it's very forgiving meaning you
can do
all sorts of silly wacky and still
get great results take a look at modern
bodybuilders have you ever watched
videos from the 90s
i grew up during that time so i've
watched nothing but ronnie coleman
branch warren training videos and god
damn do they do some silly dumb things
but guess what
they were successful in spite of that
and what we have kind of found out later
in the more modern time
not that like the 90s was that long ago
but more currently right
we found out that you know what you can
get a really good hypertrophic response
just from hitting some pretty minimum
criteria right so one of the things that
we look at is volumes like are you doing
enough training volume
we know that there's a huge spectrum of
intensities that you can work within
and from an absolute sense right so like
anywhere between 5 and 30 reps is
generally pretty good
we also know that from a relative
intensity sense right anywhere between
like
zero to four rir works pretty good
um for getting more muscle and we also
know that frequency is kind of
negotiable for some things we know that
exercise order is very negotiable in
some things
and your sfr choices these are all very
highly individualized things there's not
one particular movement per muscle group
that is better than all
what we find is that you can pick and
choose the ones that tend to work really
well for you
and even if you don't have the best
program you can get a pretty good result
now obviously you want the best program
that you can and that's why you're
watching these videos
but we know that hypertrophy training
for the most part is very forgiving so
you can do a lot of things maybe not the
best
and still get a great result however
sport training is not as forgiving right
because we're directly trying to
stimulate what we call
transfer of training effects meaning
you're doing some training that will
eventually have a positive effect on the
outcomes that you want
in your sport meaning you can run faster
jump higher throw the ball
further right make more tackles uh break
more tackles things along those lines
right so the idea being
you're doing some type of training and
that training has a direct positive
impact
on what we would call the key
performance indices of your sport
and because of that it's much more
constrained in terms of the things
that we mentioned in that previous
bullet point volume intensity frequency
exercise order
sfr we have to really start narrowing
these things down
so that we can actually stimulate direct
transfer of training effects so
that funnel is much more constrained for
sport training than it is for
hypertrophy training and that's another
problem that we run into all again
tying back to the idea of specificity so
if you guys know me i love me a good
synthol guy my favorite was
indian synthol we call him indian
synthol guy but that's because we're all
ignorant he's actually brazilian synthol
guy
but this is just another guy he's
clearly about to step into an mma fight
i wonder how it's going to go there's
definitely a video you should check it
out
anyways so when we look at training for
physique
and training for sport there's a number
of different points at which we start
to diverge or our funnels kind of go in
slightly different directions
and there are many of them but there's
four big ones that i want to talk to you
guys about today
and those are first off body composition
so
without a doubt body composition might
be the most important difference that we
see
it's hard to say one is better than the
other but it's one of the most
um has the biggest practical
implications and how we address things
differently so again
if you're a physique person within the
constraints of your lifestyle boundaries
and trade-offs that you're willing to
make
you're trying to be as lean as muscular
as those things will allow
right that is not necessarily the goal
for sporting athletes right in sports we
have to deal with things like
optimal competition body weights and
body compositions
sometimes that means increasing body
mass through you know increasing your
lean body mass and hypertrophy training
sometimes it means decreasing fat
sometimes it might mean decreasing a
little bit of both or increasing a
little bit of both so
it's not always as clear-cut as just get
as jacked
and lean as possible everybody's going
to have an ideal
competition body weight and body
composition and that's what having a
good coach and a good monitoring program
can help
all athletes do so that's a big
difference right off the bat
we're also going to see differences in
managing levels of preparedness
what is preparedness for hypertrophy
training well really all you have to do
is have enough preparedness to go in
there and get an overloading session and
if you don't know what that means go
back and watch the overload video come
on
you're too far in right but you need to
be able to every time you come in and do
a training session
assuming it's meant to be a training
session and not a recovery session you
need to present an overload for
hypertrophy how do you do that well you
really just need to be able to hit
anywhere between 5 and 30 reps for the
most part anywhere between zero to four
rir and present enough volume to
generate a progressive overload over
time it doesn't mean
necessarily the next session has to be
way more than the other one it could
just be like a one rep difference
something like that
but you need to be able to present an
overload which for the most part
is pretty freaking easy managing
preparedness for hypertrophy training
really is just not driving yourself into
the ground by having poor fatigue
management so what we know is that
hypertrophy training mrv preparedness is
way up there right so you can do a lot
of training before you start hitting
your preparedness mrv
and when we say preparedness mrv what
i'm saying is you are no longer able
to present an overload for that stimulus
for hyper hypertrophic stimulus right
so hypertrophy training for the most
part as long as you're not a knucklehead
pretty easy to manage preparedness what
else are you managing in hypertrophy
training
that's it just that that's all you got
to do it's easy right
what about sports well sports is a
little bit different because
you have multiple levels of fitness and
skills
and tactics that need to be trained all
of which are very very sensitive to the
effects of fatigue
now if you're doing hypertrophy training
for sport you kind of are in that same
boat where it's like okay i can do quite
a bit of training
but what we also know is hypertrophy
training generates a lot of fatigue
and a lot of other areas of fitness
skills and tactical development
are very sensitive to the effects of
fatigue and so what we find is that if
you're doing hypertrophy training
you will often exceed your mrv for other
areas of fitness such as things like
speed and power
or other areas of skills and tactics
like you might not be able to learn new
techniques well or at all or refine
existing techniques
you might not be able to consolidate
some of the learning that you've done
into generating good strategies for your
sport
this is real and fatigue is going to
directly interfere with those things so
in sport training
we're managing fitness skills and
tactics and physique training we're only
managing fitness for hypertrophy
which again is very easy whereas the
other things for sports tend to be a
little bit more finicky we have to be a
little bit more mindful of it
the next one is force and velocity
characteristics and this
uh directly ties to the intensity at
which we train
so again bodybuilding training or
hypertrophy training
is very forgiving you can train at high
intensities high absolute intensities
meaning like
a lot of weight on the bar you can train
at pretty low
absolute intensities meaning not that
much weight and still get a lot of
hypertrophy
unfortunately those transfer of training
effects
don't always manifest for things like
maximum strength and power
unless you're training kind of close to
that so what i mean by that is
if you're doing something like 10 to 20
reps what is the potential transfer of
training effect to doing like a 20 meter
sprint as a lacrosse player or a soccer
player
it's actually very very much outside of
the
force velocity and power characteristics
of many many sports so what we have to
do
is make sure that when we're doing
hypertrophy training we're not deviating
too
far outside of what is going to be an
effective transfer of training effect
meaning the weights can't be too light
or if they are light we have to be
moving explosively in order to get that
transfer of training effect
and unfortunately the problem that you
run into is you say okay well if you're
doing reps
of 10 to 20 you could be generating a
really really high power output on some
of those reps
that's true for about four or five reps
and then after that it just becomes junk
volume
ah so that's the problem that we run
into right
same thing goes with the higher rep
ranges like 20 to 30 or something like
that
that is going to have very little
transfer of training effects to
most sporting activities even endurance
training to some degree because the
more endur if you want to have more
endurance in the muscle your best option
is actually just do that endurance
training and not try and get it through
resistance training so
we want to make sure that the training
that we're doing is going to align with
the intensities that our sport
is done at right and sometimes in hybris
retraining it doesn't always melt
right and then last is not really unique
to hypertrophy training
it's something that we deal with with
all training and that's just opportunity
cost meaning
whatever you train you have to weigh the
pros and cons of
doing something else right there's
always something else that you could be
doing
so you want to make sure that with the
time and resources that you have you are
making the best choices right
time training resources are limited you
don't get to just have infinity
so the one the things that you do right
come at the cost of other things and
that
those other things could even just be
something simple like time spent
recovering
so we want to make sure that if we're
doing hypertrophy training
it is serving a very distinct purpose
because there's going to be pros and
cons of doing hypertrophy training
and the pros certainly must outweigh the
cons because if the cons
outweigh the pros then it's like why are
you doing this in the first place so
we want to make sure that we're looking
at the pros and cons and weighing those
opportunity costs
just like we would with any other
training right okay
so let's talk about a few of those
bullet points in a little bit more
detail
right so as we already mentioned if
you're doing physique training and
hypertrophy training you're generally
trying to be as lean and muscular as
yours lifestyle will allow for whatever
compromises that you are willing to make
if you're like your boy here
i like to throw a few back a couple
times a week
maybe three if i'm feeling froggy and
that's probably going to have a negative
effect on my body composition
but it's something that i like to do for
my lifestyle because i enjoy it right
and that's a trade-off that you
recognize
so those trade-offs that you make are up
to you
some people are willing to make more and
be more competitive some are willing to
make less no judgment that's totally
fine and maybe you won't be as jacked
no worries right but you're trying to
find that sweet spot in your
body composition goals and your
lifestyle sport
training we're really not fussing with
that too much at all really what we're
looking at is
we have normative standards of body
weight and body composition and what
that means is
you can look at your sport or maybe your
position within a sport you can look at
people
who are competitive in that sport
whatever level that you're at maybe it's
just uh
high school college world championship
nationals olympics whatever you can
actually find this kind of stuff out
just through a little bit of research
you can say
how much do the people on average that
are doing what i'm doing
weigh and what is their general fat mass
and muscle mass
at that weight these are things that you
will find through research right
and generally what we want to find is
getting our athlete closer and closer
and closer to those normative standards
within some individual boundaries right
so maybe some people actually do better
when they're a little heavier a little
lighter or
somewhere in between but what we know
for the most part is you can take an
activity
like doing hurdles for example and you
will find that people who are at the top
of their game in hurdling generally have
kind of a similar body weight and body
composition situation meaning they're
usually weigh this roughly the same
amounts and generally have the same body
fats and muscle mass amounts right
and these are things you can figure out
so when we're looking at sport training
we're not trying to be as lean and
muscular as possible we're trying to say
where is my optimal body excuse me
where's my optimal competition body
weight and body composition
and we can use normative standards to
kind of help narrow that down
and then individualize for our athlete
we also know that kind of within this
idea of an ideal competition body weight
and body composition we're dealing with
this idea of
strength and power to body weight ratios
which for me is one of the most
important aspects of
an integrated periodization plan meaning
i'm managing my athletes training i'm
managing
their diet maybe their recovery maybe
their psychology
one of the things that is my duty is to
make sure that they have found
where they compete at the best meaning
they have gone lighter they've gone
heavier they've gone
more muscular more fat less muscular
less fat and they have found you know my
best performances are at this weight
and this amount of muscle mass and i've
figured that out through trial and error
over time
and that is a huge part of sports so not
surprisingly
a lot of success in sport involves how
well
you can propel your body in the
environment or move
within the environment against
opposition right and how strong you are
and how much body weight you have
excuse me that was that one was okay i'm
trying to do a better one later i don't
get me right now
so strength and power to body weight
ratios are a really really clear-cut
thing
but unfortunately people don't think
about them and there's really only a few
examples that i can think of off the top
of my head
where it's not um not as clear and i
think you'll see where i'm going with
this with these examples
sumo wrestling right strong man american
football
in these cases it actually sometimes is
just in your benefit to be as
large as possible meaning having a lot
of muscle mass is great but sometimes
just having a lot of ballast
meaning just being a big person um can
also be really beneficial
most sports are not like that most
sports say hey you're probably going to
have your
you know best performances at you know
this percent body fat
at this body weight there's just a
handful where it's like okay it's
probably
good to be as big as possible and
there's just a few and then there's a
couple on the other direction where you
could say something like
um gymnastics kind of favors the lower
end of that spectrum not to say that
it's good to be as small as possible for
gymnastics but it's definitely one of
those where
you really are going to favor having a
lighter body weight just because you're
literally flinging yourself
all around on these different implements
through space right so we see a few
exceptions to this but
most sporting activities you can
absolutely find
normative standard and then
individualized standards for body weight
and body composition the goal is not
necessarily to be as big and lean as
possible
and in fact there's probably a big cost
in many sports to being too lean or
too fat so we've got to figure that out
so when you're trying to train for
physique one of the things that we find
is that you're actually trying to gain
muscle all around and it doesn't really
matter
what muscle fibers you're trying to
hypertrophy because you're trying to get
as big as possible you're trying to get
all those muscle fibers homie look at
ronnie
gee louise he's a big black so
what we find is that um because you can
hypertrophy under a variety of different
intensity zones
you can actually kind of preferentially
target different muscle fiber
types within any given region of your
body so that means we're actually going
to be trying to make things like our
type 2x the big explosive muscle fibers
bigger
the intermediate ones and the more slow
twitch ones all
bigger over time that's great
what about for sport now this is where
it gets kind of
weird and funky so developing an optimal
competition body weight and then of
course
tied into that is strength and power to
body weight ratios
we actually have to selectively target
which muscle fiber types that we want
because we want our weight to be filled
up
with the muscle fiber types that are
going to have the largest
impact and most success in the sport
that we're doing so for strength and
power sports we're going to be trying to
bias
towards those type 2x muscle fibers
right in uh
some other sports you can make a case
for the intermediate fibers but that's
something that you actually just train
in your sport training for the most part
you'll still be biasing towards type 2
to try and become as powerful and as
strong as you reasonably can
and then in endurance sports we're
actually trying to preferentially bias
towards those type 1 fibers a little bit
right
so what we want in developing an optimal
body composition
and power and strength to body weight
ratio is to actually accumulate
the right type of muscle mass that's
going to propel us
in our sporting endeavors so just to
kind of put it in context right
you might find that you hypertrophy
really really you're very responsive to
hypertrophy
right but you also find that when you
get too
big maybe you're in a weight class sport
or maybe you're you're just you can
exceed kind of some of those normative
standards
for body composition that you just don't
play as well because you're too heavy
it costs you a lot of energy you start
to slow down a lot right
this is a real thing so ideally and this
is maybe more true for weight class
sports but it's true for all sports
you want the content of your muscles and
that weight that you carry around
to have the largest impact on your sport
as possible you don't want to be
carrying around a lot of other muscle
that's not going to be contributing as
much as possible so
most sporting activities i would say
roughly you know 90
maybe even more are what we would
classify as strength power sports
meaning that most of the action or most
of the kpis
revolve around you being strong
explosive or fast right it doesn't mean
that there aren't other activities in
the sport it just means that the action
occurs in those kind of scenarios
and then the other kind of maybe ten
percent or so is our endurance sports
right which is really more of our
sustained output type sports so
in that case we're going to be looking
more at our kind of developing our slow
twitch muscle fibers
and in the other case the cases of
strength and power sports we're going to
be looking at developing our faster
twitch muscle fibers
so if you are a strength and power sport
athlete you don't want to load up on a
ton of slow twitch muscle because it's
just not going to be doing what you want
it to do and now you're carrying around
extra weight that's not helping and it's
decreasing
your strength and power to body weight
ratio voila
okay so that's that one we've talked a
lot about
body composition we also mentioned
before that
the preparedness for hypertrophy
training is pretty robust meaning you
can
you don't need to manage a whole lot as
long as you're not crippled with fatigue
right we already kind of alluded to this
idea that the preparedness
you need for other sports is less robust
meaning you have
other things that you're training for
when you're trying to learn refine or
integrate skills
you need to be very sharp and you need
to be kind of in that flow state
right and fatigue will directly inhibit
your physical
and psychological abilities to do those
things
so they are very very sensitive this is
true for all skills
all tactics and then many areas of
fitness so
what we find is that um other areas of
fitness right things like
you can kind of go from like a
hierarchical
perspective right you have endurance
training which is probably the most
robust
hypertrophy training kind of moving down
in order uh then you have kind of like
your strength
power speed that's what we would see in
terms of fitness they kind of have a
descending order in that regard in terms
of
how much fatigue you can tolerate how
and what the level of preparedness that
you have to manage
um similarly we see skills and tactics
very very much
way lower than hypertrophy training much
much much less and probably more similar
to what you would see
in kind of like power and speed
development if we were to make a
comparison to fitness training which is
it's hard to do that but
you get the kind of idea it's way down
there you have to have a high level of
preparedness meaning a low fatigue state
in order to train those things which
sucks so when we find that preparedness
drops too low
right and this is true for fitness
skills and tactics these things can be
overloaded just like fitness can
you can't produce an overloading
stimulus meaning you can't get better
and then attempting to
get better at those things when you
can't actually produce an overload
is junk volume you guessed it right
so we run into this problem where you're
too fatigued
to actually train the things that you
want to train you're trying to do so
but you're not getting anything out of
it so you're just producing even
more fatigue than you were before and
not getting better at the things that
you want
 that sucks right that's a big old
smoothie that you're drinking so we have
to manage these different levels of
preparedness which is very very
difficult and
this is not always a clear cut like oh
just dial back this
dial back this and you're good this is
something that you have to manage as an
athlete
and with coaches and sports scientists
to help you out along the way because
it's complicated right
so the fatigue that you get from doing
hypertrophy training
will absolutely cap you off on what you
can do in your other areas of fitness
skills and tactics this is not up for
debate it's just something it's the same
thing as
training for fitness in any other
capacity right if you're too fatigued it
won't work well if you're
training for skills and tactics if
you're too fatigued it also won't work
right
more so than fitness in many cases
because they're inherently tied to
learning so what we find is that
hypertrophy training because of the high
volumes of training and this is this is
kind of the problem that you run into is
in order to get a good overloading
stimulus for hypertrophy generally you
need to train at high volumes right the
intensity is negotiable but we'll get
more into that later
but for the most part you need to
generate a pretty large volume of
training
the volume is going to have a parallel
direct kind of linear relationship with
your fatigue state so the more stuff you
do
the more your fatigue goes up well as
that fatigue goes up
you start exceeding your preparedness
amounts for all these different things
right and that's the problem that you
run into so hypertrophy training is
very fatiguing and that fatigue will
prevent you from training these other
things so
we have to strategically plan
hypertrophy training periods
if we're going to do it for our athletes
during times that will have a minimal
impact on their other kpis right meaning
if you have to focus on your other
skills and tactics as
urgent uh urgent things that need to be
done hypertrophy training is not what
you want to be doing right then and
there you might want to put that off to
another time
like maybe uh like in your off season or
more general prepared
gpp type training so that it's not going
to squash the training that's maybe more
important to you right now which is
actually getting good at your sport
so we have to implement those things
strategically and usually what we
recommend
and what i recommend for a long time is
any type of body composition alteration
whether you're trying to
maintain muscle while you lose fat or
increase muscle mass uh
and gain fat at the same time should be
done during those gpp periods which is
well well well away from any competition
periods and before any specific
preparatory periods so
you'll do that stuff early on in the
training maybe for you know a couple
mesos
and then you'll move into your specific
preparatory training and no more body
composition changes occur from that
point on until you move on to the next
cycle
so one of the things that we also
mentioned within this idea of
body composition strength of power body
weight ratios
is this idea of having the same muscle
type characteristics
uh preferentially trained as you are
going to be competing with right
and so we know that hypertrophy training
is very forgiving you can use a
wide range of loading schemes to get a
hypertrophy stimulus and that's great
unfortunately the kpis for sport will
generally revolve around
high force high power or high velocity
type activities and this is just an
example of a force velocity curve with a
little power curve drawn in there
right so we are going to be bias have to
bias
some of our training to those higher
intensity type trainings and when we say
higher intensity
that might mean using a lot of weight
right and really trying to maximize the
amount of weight on the bar and the
forces that produce
or trying to maximize movement speed or
power output
right um what we don't want to see is
training at like a mid to range
mid-range to low range intensity loading
zone and not actually moving
at high velocities or high power outputs
that unfortunately is effectively a
waste of time and junk volume for most
of our athletes who are strength power
athletes so
in that regard this is another area
where we tend to be constricted we have
to funnel down
our specificity of training to favor
either the high force
high velocity or high power output style
training
now again you might think like well if
you do something that's 20 to 30 reps
can't you just do it fast it's like yeah
you can do it fast for a few reps but
then the rest of them are all just junk
right and then that junk is going to
prevent you from being fast in
subsequent sets that's the problem you
went into
so typically for sport training we're
going to be biasing
for most sports towards those type 2
characteristics which can be trained
through
again high force or high power type
activities and
even for our endurance training folks
we're going to be biasing a lot of the
strength training eventually towards
that so we're going to spend some time
working on work capacity and stuff like
that
but it still benefits most of our
endurance athletes to train for strength
to some degree
at the very least to maintain your
muscle mass and reduce your training
volumes or to prevent injuries
or if you're doing something like
triathlon you might actually have to be
going up and down hills
and strength can be really really useful
for hills and things like that so we're
going to be biasing for the most part
towards our type
2 characteristics now
what we find is that when you do
hypertrophy training it's generally not
done in such a way that is meant to
maximize strength or power output
outcomes right which is again one some
of the biggest kpis for most sports so
we're generally going to see
our biasing our hypertrophy so we have
to kind of split the difference right so
you've got to be strong and powerful
but if you just train for like threes
that's probably not the best way to get
hypertrophy right so what we find is
we're going to actually bias towards
that lowest
end of our effective hypertrophy rep
range which is that five to ten rep
range
and this is something that actually has
been shown to have phase potentiated
transfer of training effects meaning
if you train for sets of five to ten
that is heavy enough
to have downstream uh strength
improvements when you start training for
strength right you will gain muscle
and you will gain muscle in such a way
that is good for developing strength and
or power so this is something that's
been
shown for a long time even with some
mathematical modeling
so that rep range tends to be the most
bias in our hypertrophy training towards
those type 2 characteristics
and so that's where we're going to spend
most of our time you can include some of
those uh
10 to 20 rep ranges but my strong
recommendation
would generally not be to not do that
unless you're having specific light
sessions
probably don't ever want to be going
above 15 reps for the most part just
because they're going to have
very very little carryover that's not to
say that some movements might not
respond
better in that range for example like
arms and delts or you don't want to be
doing sets of five it's just
silly if you've ever done it before you
know exactly what i'm talking about just
not a good payout
so you might buy us some movements in
some instances into that higher rep
range
but your main movements probably are
going to be spent in that 5 to 10 rep
range right
training at higher reps and higher lower
loading zones tends to shift the motor
units towards
being in that slow twitch or more
fatigue resistant type state
rather than being in more of that fast
twitch forceful
explosive state which is what we want so
we don't want to be shifting
our fiber characteristics over to more
slow twitch more fatigue resistant
and whatever we need for sport we'll get
that through our sport training like if
you're a rugby player a soccer player
you need to be you need to have some
endurance but guess what you get that
through your conditioning and your
your sport practice you don't have to do
that in the weight room the weight room
is going to be meant for you
getting stronger and then
our last big bullet point you know we
said before all training is subject to
opportunity costs meaning
you could be doing something else you
want to make sure that your time is
being well spent
we know that hypertrophy training
requires a lot of volume and thus a lot
of fatigue gets generated
and it also requires a lot of time like
you might end up spending a couple hours
in the gym rather than just like 45
minutes doing your normal strength kind
of workout right
so we know that it does come at a very
large cost you're going to generate a
lot of fatigue you're going to be
spending a lot of time doing it
and that might prevent you from training
other areas of your kpi
so any coach and athlete
who is deciding to do hypertrophy
training for the purposes of their sport
you have to weigh the pros and cons and
say okay you might actually compete
better
at one or two weight classes up the way
that you will be better is if you have
more muscle and then more strength and
then more power right
but to get there it might take months
years of you know phase potentiated
hypertrophy training
which will take you away from doing the
other parts of your sport
can we do that or would that be too
great of a cost right
and there's no clear-cut answer and
that's why you have to have a really
good needs analysis if you've ever
followed any of my stuff you've probably
heard me talk about needs analysis
before
i actually have a whole video on it but
this is key right you have to weigh the
pros and cons and say
what is going to have the largest impact
in the short and long term
juice does my athlete need to lose fat
yes or no do they need to gain muscle
yes or no
or do they just suck at basketball do
they just are they just shitty right
is the bigger concern developing the
skills and tactics right those are real
questions it's very difficult to answer
and that's why a formal needs analysis
can help funnel that down a little bit
all right so now if we're going to
incorporate some of these ideas into a
good hypertrophy training program what
do we need to know well the good news is
i made a lot of cases why it's different
but
at the end of the day a lot of it's the
same right
most of the same rules apply which makes
our life a little bit easier
so some of the more fundamental things
like are we going to be training our
muscles from mev to mrv
yes now i would make an argument
that if you have someone and they are
doing another sport or activity
you might train from mev to mav because
mav is still a really really robust
stimulus and the difference between
getting from mav to mrv might be a whole
shitload of fatigue
with very very small differences in
payout right so
you don't have to train an mev you can
go the same thing any v to mrv
but consider any muscle group you take
to an mrv
is going to lose a substantial amount of
preparedness which may
prevent you from doing other things
whereas just training to mav
may allow you to hang in there just
enough to keep going with a lot of your
sports stuff or at the very least
not have to restrict yourself too much
from fatigue so my suggestion would be
mav could be a very good alternative in
this case right
we still want you to make good sfr
choices to minimize systemic fatigue
now the problem that we run into here is
that in physique training a lot of
really high sfr choices might be kind of
like our more
isolation type exercises and that's okay
in this context however
we would want to bias our choices to
those which are going to have really
good transfer of training effects
and which movements are those well sorry
to tell you
they're generally going to be our
compound barbell type movements right so
your your pressing movements your
squatting movements your pulling
movements your weight lifting
derivatives etc
right so in this case you still want
good sfr choices right so
even in this case like doing a low bar
squat is probably a poor sfr choice
because the fatigue you get from it is
so
awful right whereas you might be able to
do something like a high bar squat
that's going to have a ton of carryover
the sfr is going to be pretty good
on average for most people and you might
include some other isolation or leg
press kind of
movements later on if you still have
some volume to fill
what we don't want to see is you
preferentially biasing towards like
isolation movements a good example of
this might be like um
you might have for physique training you
might be very responsive in your packs
to doing like a cable fly and you might
be like damn i get a lot out of these
cable flies and that's great
no no judgment um but for something like
football
or rugby or any some like our contact
sports where you have to extend your
arms out maybe push or pull people or
block people
what's going to have a better transfer
of training in fact those cable flies or
the bench press
the bench press more often than not and
so we have to kind of strike a balance
here where
we still want good high sfr choices like
movements that get you really strong
and have high transfer of training
effects and more often than not
that will mean kind of whittling down
some of our isolation movements out not
completely but just
biasing more towards those heavy barbell
compound movements
more often than not now again they also
tend to be more fatiguing so you might
have to balance those out a little bit
but again that's the price you pay for
the transfer of training effects you
really want those compound movements in
there as much as you can
reasonably and then things like volume
and intensity progressions
will follow the same general patterns
again moving from mev to either mav or
mrv we already talked about that
increasing the weight on the bar to stay
in your loading zones and uh you know
absolute excuse me relative intensities
and then having some kind of progression
in
relative intensity as well whether it's
effort or rir
or however you want to do it all those
things still apply here
there are some differences that are
noteworthy we know that your
local muscle and your systemic mrvs will
be much lower than that
of if you were just doing hypertrophy
training alone meaning
if you were doing some sport training
and hypertrophy training take your
hypertrophy numbers and squish them down
a little bit
how much depends on how much other sport
training that you are doing
but just don't use the same numbers that
you're doing before because
you have added a whole another training
element maybe you have practice a couple
times per week maybe you're doing some
other specific training
so just take your normal stuff your
systemics and your locals and drive them
down a little bit because you have added
another training stimulus that you have
to account for
no big deal if you've read how much
should i train you'd be like yeah duh
got it
right we also know that cardiovascular
training and most sports have some
cardiovascular component and most kind
of recreational activities have some
cardiovascular component as well
will have a bigger impact on your
systemic mrv so
basically if you have some kind of
structured cardio training that you're
doing
assume your systemic mrv goes down a
little bit compared to hypertrophy
training alone and that's not to say
it's bad it's just how it is right so
if you have some kind of structured
cardio component that's going to be very
impactful on your systemic mrv
and possibly your local too if you're
you know running or whatever modality
you're using
it's going to have an effect on the
local muscles but for sure your systemic
is going to be much lower
and then again we've already kind of
beat this one to death your intensity
will generally be biased in that 5-10
rep range to ensure that you're going to
have good transfer of training effects
to your sport
especially in the areas of strength and
power a couple other changes that are
maybe useful for you
you're going to probably reduce your
training frequency per muscle group
by about a half a session to one session
per week
less than you would normally do for
hypertrophy training meaning
if you trained biceps four times a week
when you're not doing sports
when you are doing sports and
hypertrophy you might do it three times
a week something like that
we say a half because sometimes you have
kind of like a light session where it's
not
you know super directly stimulated but
it is stimulated to some degree
so you know whether it was sometimes you
have recovery sessions etc right so
anywhere between a half session to one
session less
per week is a good starting point and
then again adjusting from there
we're also going to encourage our
athletes to move with maximal intent
meaning
whenever they're doing a repetition
they're going to try and move the bar
as forcefully and fast as they can now
if you're doing sets of five how fast
can you really move not that fast right
but your intent
is to move really fast this is something
that's easy to say
but also easy to forget so one thing
that we like to remind our athletes who
are doing hyperspeed training
say when you move that bar you're doing
eight reps but you're gonna move
really hard really forcefully every
single time you do a rep even up to
eight reps now
it's going to slow down right certainly
but we want to be moving with that
maximal intent
and kind of shifting that force velocity
curve as much to the right
as we can right uh we also know that we
sometimes it's easier to consolidate
some of our muscle groups like if you're
doing physique training
you might be breaking down every single
muscle group into mevs mavs etc right
for sport training sometimes that's just
unnecessarily complicated
and you might just consolidate down into
things like push pull
like legs or anterior chain posterior
chain legs something like that
just because it's easier than saying
like okay well i did a clean pull and
that's kind of quads but it's kind of
glued it's
kind of i don't know it's kind of
hamstrings at least at one point like
you know what i mean so
uh sometimes it's just easier to say
okay today we're getting our 10 sets
or you know this week we're getting 10
sets of push upper body push and that
will be a combination of maybe some
different pressing movements and that's
perfectly fine it's okay to do it that
way
you can certainly be more complicated
but oftentimes
it's unnecessarily complicated so as a
coach as an athlete only you can figure
out where that balance is
usually i would say consolidate those
things down a little bit make your life
a little bit easier you're not really
going to be losing out on much
if you don't count it as chest and you
only count it as push and vice versa
right
and then a couple other things that's
worth noting if you have some
cardiovascular component you're going to
be dealing with concurrent training
issues
sometimes it's good to keep those things
separate you can actually make a good
case that sometimes it's good to have
those things maybe in the same day
and that's something that our friend and
colleague chad wesley smith calls the
consolidation of stressors and i love
that phrasing i think it's really really
good and basically what that says is
like hey if you have to
run several times a week and you have to
train legs
several times a week most people will
think okay run
or you know lift this day run this day
live this day
run this day and the next thing you know
you're essentially training legs
virtually every day of the week and you
have no recovery sessions
it is good to have some space on some
days especially for those where you have
to have like a high level of
preparedness meaning like if you're
squatting heavy or you're doing like
high intensity interval training you got
to be
you have to hit an intensity threshold
in order for it to be stimulative
and so some space is good in those cases
in other cases where you're not you know
as limited by intensity like if you have
a longer run or low at lower intensities
you can actually pair some of these
things up like you might do a lifting
with the legs in the morning
and then a cardio in the evening and
actually have both of those done in the
same day
you might be like why on earth would you
do that well you'd only do it for
exercises and activities
where the intensity is not as limiting
and what you gain
by doing so is actually recovery days
for that muscle group throughout the
week which is really good
right so instead of you know indirectly
training legs four to five times a week
because you split up your cardio and
your weight training
now you can reduce one or two of those
days off and actually have some
significant recovery days for whatever
you know this particular muscle group in
question is
ah that was okay so anyways really good
ideas there to start thinking about okay
what is the proximity of my cardio
training to my weight training can i
keep those separate as much as possible
and then also do i want to have them on
the same days or should i consolidate
them into one days and make sure that
i'm giving some parts to my body
a little bit of rest so just some kind
of key points to wrap
up here when you're doing hypertrophy
training for sport
we're going to bias most of our
hypertrophy
hypertrophy training method excuse me
into our compound barbell movements as
much as possible
in that 5 to 10 rep range we might use
some isolation movements we might use
some higher rep ranges
selectively but that's where the gross
body of our work should be done
we're going to encourage our athlete to
move with maximal intent on every rep as
silly as it might seem at times we want
them to
really be pushing that force velocity
characteristics
on the curve to the right as much as
possible meaning either getting stronger
or moving the same weight faster than
they could before
we're going to be trying to reduce some
of the volumes in our other areas of
fitness skills and tactics
to accommodate hypertrophy training you
cannot do what you normally do
and then add hypertrophy training on top
of it in terms of your sports stuff
right you have to take down your other
areas of fitness you have to take down
your tactics and skill training
if you don't you're going to run into
fatigue problems and you're going to run
into preparedness problems so
make some headway dial those dials down
on the sound board
right and say okay i have to accommodate
some training resources
so that i can still have hyper
productive hypertrophy training and then
still make some progress or at least hit
some mv's on these other areas that i'm
working on within my sport as well
right we might reduce some of our
baseline frequencies by about a half a
session to one session
per muscle per week and then we're going
to try to avoid having our resistance
training and cardiovascular training
done
in the same session with possible this
is just a kind of common concurrent
training recommendation that we make
sometimes it just happens to work out
that way happens it's not a huge
deal but when possible try and put some
space in between those
and then we also want to consider maybe
using multiple training sessions per day
to consolidate some of those training
sessions throughout the week and have
distinct
recovery periods where different parts
of our bodies actually get a break so
they're not always just taking a beating
all the time
