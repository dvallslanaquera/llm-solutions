music
can help push you harder during training
having certain thoughts
can help push you a little bit more
during training
having the right mindset maybe a
training partner or two
to push you along but with a real
serious workout
especially leg training at the end of
the day
when you're in that machine midway
through the range of motion
at the very bottom bar on your back
it's all on you and remember
you're in the gym for fun this is all
voluntary
you can quit any time you want
but you're not going to quit because you
want to grow
so nut up feel the pain
get that super depth on all of your
movements
and let the growth commence
