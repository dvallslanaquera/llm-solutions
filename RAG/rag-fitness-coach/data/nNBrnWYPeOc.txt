what's up renaissance periodization
youtube i'm back here with your all's
favorite natural bodybuilder dylan white
who is now in his off period after his
really successful competitive season uh
he's weighing what are you weighing
right now about 2 15. 2 215 natural
bodybuilding ipe pro he is a very
competitive high level natural
bodybuilder and you guys love to see
that um
all of you two fitness experts out there
had a lot to say last time
but dylan is in his uh
his
basically high volume post contest
period where we're pushing a lot of
metabolites using a lot of intensity
techniques so we're going to put him
through his pull session training today
you're going to see a lot of like giants
at supersets things of that nature
you can read about that in the mini cup
manual why we tend to do that uh you can
get that on the renaissance
periodization website but we talked a
little bit about the periodization for
post show uh in the post contest season
we talked about that periodization and a
few charts in there on the in the mini
cup manual so it'll go in more detail
than i will here but we're going to put
them through this pool session push
metabolites get a good pump and you guys
can make all the fake natty claims you
want in the comments
[Music]
dylan is actually emphasizing some of
these muscle groups uh that he's
training currently so
one strength that dylan has is his back
and because of that we've put his
back volume on maintenance and with that
today is a pull session but we've put
his lateral delts and his biceps i
believe before his back training so
that's one uh thing you can do when
you're emphasizing muscle groups as well
as like
putting whatever muscle groups are
emphasizing the beginning of the week uh
things of that nature we have we talked
about that in uh the new hypertrophy
book actually um how you can emphasize
muscle groups but
his first thing is an intensity
technique for the lateral delts he's
going to be doing a dumbbell lateral
race superset to dumbbell upright road
gonna push a lot of metabolites as i
said
and uh
let's let's get to it
week three
take this pretty close to failure
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
good
let's go
[Music]
you're going to notice today dylan is
doing quite a bit of volume
in this post show high volume period
we take it to effect account that most
people
after they get done with the
bodybuilding competition especially a
season of multiple competitions they're
pretty hungry and craving stuff and they
tend to eat a little bit
so dylan was actually up like 10 pounds
within a couple weeks
after we got done with his competition
season because of that people are able
to
add a little more volume in more than
they had been doing during their deficit
period especially the super harsh
deficit at the end so don't actually
have five sets of these lateral raises
today
um again back is still on maintenance
volume that actually helps us bump up
lateral delt volume even more because
you don't have the systemic fatigue from
all of the back volume that you were
doing all week so over the course of the
entire week he might have like 20 22
sets of lateral delts biceps
and all the other muscle groups that
we're emphasizing including these
hamstrings and quads
so he's utilizing all these nutrients
that he's been eating and it's not
necessarily a bad thing that he gains
that much weight because after this we
go into a maintenance period anyway uh
or if you really overdo it as somebody
who is in a high volume post contest
period you can just knock uh knock down
to a mini cut after a good five six
weeks of just gaining gaining weight for
a little while and then you can go into
a maintenance period
training's been going well it's like
psychologically i'm like oh fucking go
train again this motivation's super high
yeah good man
it's it's always you always lose sight
of that deep in the prep you're like why
am i doing this yeah and then you get
done you eat a little bit of food and
you're like i love training why was i so
miserable especially that last
three weeks yeah do that last two it's
tough
[Music]
dylan is done with his lateral delts
we're moving on to his back
again he's at maintenance volume for
back so we're doing a machine row
exercise there's only two sets he has a
couple rowing exercise a couple times a
week and we keep those sets consistent
across the week again maintenance volume
only two sets 10 to 15 reps i believe 15
to 20 reps somewhere in there
there you go big retraction boom nice
and slow
let it stretch pull you forward
retract hard yep perfect every rep
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
perfect reps doing
full stretch full stretch let's shoot a
few part right here right here right
here good
you're gonna notice
dylan is maintaining
for back volume
but
every single rep is the highest of
quality
some people when they decide to put a
muscle on a back burner or on
maintenance they come in they kind of
haphazardly they're doing your sets like
oh this muscle group's on maintenance
today so they come in so they're
maintaining quads they do a couple sets
of eight in the squat but it doesn't
look like
the same type of training when they're
actually trying to put tissue on
so they tend to stray away from the
technique which is during this time you
really want to hone in on the technique
and make sure that every single rep is
with intent
just like just like your normal training
just because you're moving to
maintenance volume it doesn't mean that
that training goes down the wash that
training needs to be just
you need to come and approach it the
exact same way that you're approaching
the muscles that you're emphasizing or
the muscles that you're training when
you're dieting down it has to be the
same and it's the same thing in a
maintenance phase whenever you're in a
maintenance phase you should be going in
there with the same exact intent as a
diet phase or a massing phase and train
like you're supposed to
every reptile every rep
[Music]
yes
[Music]
last one
[Music]
what's up
what's next
giant set
postscript rose seed
[Music]
the next movement is going to be a
seated cable road giant set now
this is an intensive technique for the
back
because you are pretty volume resistant
after an entire hypocaloric period not
only does the hypochloric period uh make
a lot of physiological changes to the
muscle but training with high volumes
for a long time also does that so
using these intensity techniques is kind
of like using a new means of volume
accumulation in order to
build tissue and gain back some loss
tissue from the prep so the giant set
whereas it's not as many reps as you
would normally do with a giant set when
you're emphasizing or maintaining your
muscle tissue during a diet phase
it is still a giant set to sequester
metabolites so he's doing only i think
30 to 40 total reps
and usually in like a week three of a
mesocycle he'd be hitting this exercise
if he was trying to gain a lot of lean
tissue on the back he'd be doing like 70
75 reps 80 reps of a giant set so
there'll be a lot more rest pauses in
there than he's going to be doing today
so he's going to get about 20 or so in
the first a couple pauses and he'll
already have his rep achievement for the
day and again it's just maintenance
volume for the back
let's go
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
[Applause]
hmm
[Music]
40.
[Music]
all done
flat pull downs magical pull downs
[Music]
next
uh finishing off the back just a couple
sets of lap pull downs uh in the 15 to
20 rep range this will be the final back
exercise today he does this twice a week
again it's just maintenance volume and
then after this i believe he has a
bunch of sets of bicep curls
good stuff
[Music]
good
[Music]
that's good
[Music]
shit
[Music]
my farms are pumped to be fuck up
so dylan ever up the same
[Music]
good done
dale
god damn it no
you didn't touch your chest on the last
one why would you do another one
hey
i was chasing the number stop it
we don't chase numbers that's how you
get yourself rabbit little bitch
dr mike here oh sorry i miss him so much
uh next exercise for dylan is incline
dumbbell curls uh this is one of those
exercises that
before dylan we found it has a very good
sfr
stimulus fatigue ratio
he gets really good pumps with this it
gets pretty sore it has a very high
eccentric component because you're an
incline and you're letting it pull you
down and stretch your bicep really deep
that deep stretch deep painful stretch
on the bicep you get with like
sort of like preacher curls and slower
eccentric cable curls things like that
so
dylan loves these we put them in at the
end of the
pull session biceps tend to interfere
with the
back a little more than like training
lateral delts first would so if you are
emphasizing your biceps and your lateral
delts in a mesocycle you can put your
biceps first but you're going to be very
very careful when you go on and you do a
bunch of your pull stuff
so we put him at the end here dylan has
used biceps already his back's huge so
biceps after the back stuff is fine
lateral adults first because he really
needs to emphasize the lateral delts but
let's get to these incline dumbbell
curls
[Music]
um
oh
ugh
[Music]
good stuff dylan
oh boy
outro this shit
yeah drink that shit
oh yeah
there you have it uh dylan's full
session
week three
post volume post contest period
again some things you remember
you're probably gonna eat a lot of food
after your contest or contest season and
that's okay as long as you put it to use
don't overdo it obviously but come in
here train with lots of volume use a lot
of intensity techniques so you're
keeping the weights lower you're gonna
notice that about week three or four
you're able to use pretty heavy loads
again but you should try to minimize
that as much as possible you don't want
to come in here you're still pretty
fatigued as far as your joints and your
ligaments and things go so just come in
here use a lot of intensity techniques
like dylan did today
and make use of all that the nutrients
that you're getting after the focus
close contest period but
dylan
good job
you're looking great still
you had a great season
and you guys decide natty or not i mean
i don't know the guy's huge
