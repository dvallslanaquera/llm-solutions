hey folks dr mike castell here for
renaissance purestation rp plus and rp
university supposedly
to talk to you about muscle gain
periodization
lecture five in nutritional approaches
to gaining muscle
let's get into it and see what we're
getting ourselves started up with today
so
uh first we're gonna try to answer a
question of why not just keep gaining
indefinitely what is really the problem
with that because if we can't find any
problems with that we should just keep
gaining indefinitely being
big is awesome if that's what you want
seems like a very straightforward
approach
it has its problems when we get into
those after we
sort of define what their problems are
we're going to define a formal need for
fat loss phases right after okay clearly
we can't keep gaining forever
and if you know we can't keep dating
forever maybe that's going to have
something to do with body fat we'll get
into that for sure
we're going to talk about why fat loss
phases are important then
you know we could start to think okay
we've got a muscle gain phases and then
fat loss phases and muscle gain phases
we could just zigzag through those
forever
it turns out there's a little bit of a
need for what are called maintenance
phases we'll define them we'll talk
about where they come from and why there
might be a need there and then we're
going to describe how that gives birth
to a phasic structure
a periodized structure for growing
muscle over the long term
so that nutrition for muscle gain isn't
just about eating more and growing and
growing growing in a linear way
there's going to have to be some kind of
structured approach that makes sense
over the long term
a really quick analogy there is if you
want to be good at your job and
productive at work
the approach isn't just to do work do
work do work forever and just keep
getting better and better at your work
you know you get tired from work you
might need a weekend here and there
sometimes weekends aren't enough and you
might need a holiday season here and
there to get away from work for quite a
while
you may need to shift your scope
projects at work so on and so forth so
even if your job is to just try to do as
good of work as possible
it's not just a linear approach of let's
just get the work done forever
there's going to have to be some nuance
and there's going to have to be some
phasic structure that develops call that
phasor structure and sport science
periodization so after that
we'll do a quick sample of long-term
gain periodization
it's going to be really complicated on
the slides or what you're going to see
there
but we're going to sort of pick out how
to spot periodization and spot the
general trends
the example is going to be fairly
complex it's for a competitive
bodybuilder
but we're going to inspect some elements
of that periodization and really point
out okay here's where the gain phases
are
here's where the maintenance phases are
that's why they are where they are
here's where the fat loss phases are
and why they are structured the way they
are to accomplish the goal that we want
all right let's get into it first topic
why not just
keep gaining right so people will say
things like you don't need periodization
for muscle growth
right you just just fucking grow just
eat and lift and you'll get huge right
and they'll say just you know lift and
eat you'll grow it's fine advice for
beginners
right advice for beginners tends not to
work for more advanced people sometimes
right
and so the question is the answer is yes
you will grow muscle if you just keep
eating so on and so forth but for how
long
can you keep this up one of the
sort of hard delimiters on this process
is the fact that you cannot
continually be in a surplus without
accumulating a considerable amount of
fat gain
right and how is that a problem well
here's the deal if you just
want to be big like you don't care if
it's muscle or fat
you want plenty of muscle but a lot of
fat too doesn't matter
you're going to try to be a sumo
wrestler then potentially you can you
know if you want to be 35
body fat later in your life and huge
you're
just fine gaining probably right that's
not a big deal
we're going to talk about a little bit
how for other reasons it might not be
the best way to do things but if you
don't really care about how fat you are
then this linear gain approach
definitely has fewer downsides for you
but if you you know are a person who is
doing this for appearance purposes or
for sport performance purposes
and you're any sport but a sumo wrestler
the continual gain approach
probably isn't good because you're going
to have to rein in your body fat at
least
every now and again so something to at
least get body fat in check
every now and again is a very very good
idea
never mind even the problem with p
ratios right and we'll talk about that
in a bit but yes it's very well known
that as you gain more body fat your
proclivity to gain more and more muscle
goes down
right so if you're gaining body fat and
you're sorry if you're gaining weight
and you're 10 body fat you gain a
certain amount of muscle
if you're 20 body fat you actually gain
more fat
on average and if you're 30 you gain a
lot of fat and not a ton of muscle
so that becomes a problem but just even
never mind the p ratios even if that's
not such a big effect because p ratios
are not a huge effect
never mind the p ratios that's not such
a big effect potentially it's okay if
it's not a huge effect
because uh it's one of those things that
just the body fat itself is a bad enough
problem
right all right body fat's a bad problem
let's put that formally and talk about
the need for fat loss phases
why do we need them potentially here's
why
first the obvious because all hyper
caloric periods of gaining weight
are muscle and fat gain periods
so if you're trying to do lean gains or
something like that you're gaining only
muscle and no fat
over the long term that's very possible
by doing dedicated muscle and fat gain
phases
and then dedicated fat loss phases and
then you do enough of those and
eventually you gain a
net no body fat or very little and you
gain a net
huge amount of muscle but if not both at
the same time
right it's kind of like saying you know
when you're working hard on something
and you're doing a real good job at work
fatigue from work just comes with the
process
okay there's nobody in any real serious
career
that's working dozens of hours a week
and is like man i can just do this
forever with no weekends
i'm not really sure what your job is
whatever your job is you're not pushing
yourself hard enough at work to be your
most productive if you're
really good at what you do at work
you're going to accumulate some fatigue
right and you're going to have to take
dedicated times to get rid of that
fatigue that's what evenings are for
that's what sleep is for
that's what weekends are for so when
you're a medical resident and you're
going to be a doctor i guess that
doesn't apply for a couple of years
but nobody says a feedback about the
process like oh you know it was great
it's really tough and it's not the best
way to do things you need breaks
just the same way hypercaloric periods
bring body fat they just do
now someone could say look i don't take
it overboard i gain at really slow rates
i keep my diet really clean i do a lot
of cardio yes that will minimize the
amount of fat gain
but it will also minimize the amount of
muscle gain right is there a good
healthy balance
there that you gain plenty of fat or
sorry plenty of muscle but not a ton of
fat
yes but eventually that mathematical
relationship of some fat always comes
with
holds and it's gonna be more fat than
you would concomitally expect
for a normalizing of body fat percentage
so it's not like you gain the same
percent of muscle and fat as you go
it's not like at 190 pounds you're 12
fat and you gain fat and gain muscle
at such a rate that you are 220 pounds
later and 12 percent fat if you just
gain straight
your percentage of body fat will go up
it does it every single time if you're
sufficiently advanced
beginners this doesn't apply to but then
again if we're just talking about
nutrition from us again for beginners
just eat food
eat some protein and you'll grow it's
not much advice this is more getting in
the weeds when you start to really have
trouble with gains
number two p ratios right partitioning
ratios we talked about them last time
p ratios are the ratio of the amount of
muscle you gain
versus fat that you gain when you add
body weight
right so a perfect example of something
that improves your p ratio
bear with me super complex weight
training right imagine gaining weight
without weight training you just eat
more
right your p ratio is awful you gain
mostly fat and very little muscle
if you weight train your p ratio gets
much better you get a whole lot more fat
and not or sorry whole lot more muscle
and not nearly as much fat
pretty good but one effect of the
on the p ratio is your actual body fat
level
so if you're gaining and you're around
ten percent so if you gain from ten to
fifteen percent body fat as a male or
you know fifteen to twenty two percent
body fat as a female
you're going to be gaining at a very
very good p ratio at least as far as
body fat is concerned
so as your body fat percentage is going
to set you up for mostly muscle gains to
the extent you're able
and not bias you towards fat gains take
that same person
and instead start them out at 25 body
fat and then they gain to 30
you gain more fat and less muscle than
we would expect
right just because the body fats are
different so put it in a much simpler
way
being fatter means you gain less muscle
when you gain weight
as you can see that's a big problem for
us because if you say i'm going to gain
forever
by the time you get in the 20s and 30s
and body fat percent and if you're a
female of the 30s and 40s
you're getting to the point where you're
really kind of spinning your wheels a
lot
somebody could ask you hey how much
muscle have you gained in the last six
months and you're like
gee you know if we're going to be
objective about it probably like a pound
like how much body fat have you gained
probably 12 pounds like wow is that
really worth it at that point
do you still gain muscle absolutely some
of the athletes
um as uh eric helms has pointed out some
of the athletes are the highest lean
body masses in sport are sumo wrestlers
well that's because they're like
gigantic because we 400 pounds you're
going to have some muscle under there
you're trained your whole life
but their muscle to fat ratios are not
amazing and would they gain more muscle
if they got leaner every now and again
like strong man or something
almost certainly next one
this is a common one that a lot of
people miss fat gain is unhealthy
if you gain fat past a sort of normal
range athletic range it starts to mess
with your health
especially in the long term you probably
won't feel the effects currently because
you're an athlete you're active
but it all adds up over time it puts
extra stress on your organs it's bad for
your hormonal system
and 50 trillion other different ways
that being over fat is not a good idea
so vacaine is not the greatest thing in
the world
and if you're just gaining the super
high body fat all the time because
you're not taking fat loss phases when
you need to
you're just not going to be super
healthy so fat loss phases good for
making sure that just to reduce the body
fat level for its own sake
because p ratios are improved after a
fat loss phase and you gain more muscle
after a fat loss phase
because fat gain is very unhealthy and
even if none of these other things apply
it's just no good reason to get to 30 or
40 percent fat uh if you want to live
a good productive healthy life number
four
let's say you don't care about your
health your bodybuilder you're a strong
man
uh especially if you're bodybuilder at
this point next point applies
and you're like whatever i'll do all the
fat loss diets in the world once i'm big
enough
so you never sort of intermittently do
fat loss diets to keep body weight you
know body fat and check
here's the problem you could say i
should want to get to 300 pounds
and that'll cut down you get to 300 and
then you cut down to 220
right huge fat loss phase huge lifetime
of muscle gain
okay you gained a lot of muscle and you
lost all the fat well
here's the deal gaining that much fat
getting into the 20s and 30s especially
the 30s and body fat percent
leaves permanent side effects that you
can't get rid of
one of them is loose skin and if you
gain enough fat and it changes the
physical shape of your body to the naked
eye
a lot of that is an expansion of skin
cells and a stretching of the skin
and that takes a long time to resorb
years
sometimes if it's bad enough it requires
uh corrective surgery
so basically if you decide to get
enormous and then you go back to having
a small waist you're going to have loose
skin that hangs over a little bit
even if it doesn't hang over it's going
to look a little bit looser and it's
going to keep you from having that
shrink wrapped appearance that you want
when you're super lean
so you pay that price for years
afterwards if not in some cases forever
right you don't want to get surgery
to get the fat off loose skin off that's
that's a huge investment itself comes
its own recovery timelines
a high risk of all kinds of stuff real
nasty way to go about it so if you could
avoid it with some fat loss phases
that's really for the best
here's another thing as you gain a lot
of body fat
your fat cells what they do is they
hypertrophy so they get bigger they fill
up with fat
when your muscle sells hypertrophy they
just get bigger to a point and then they
have some satellite cells they can throw
in there but they fundamentally don't
undergo hyperplasia they don't undergo
cell division
and cell replication they just undergo
hypertrophy which is the
physical growth of a singular cell fat
cells do undergo hyperplasia and they go
under
undergo hyperplasia very reliably in in
humans have been shown time and again
so what does that mean let's say you
start with you know 10 fat cells i mean
it's like hundreds of trillions or
whatever we'll just say 10 to keep it
easy
you start out with 10 and they all fill
up to the point where they can't add any
more
uh fat and they still have their own my
nuclear domain from a couple lectures
back they can only control a cell of
such big size
when they get to their myonuclear domain
ceiling the bigger the biggest the cell
will get
there's a processed trigger that causes
cell division so now the cell divides
cuts in half and now you have two
smaller fat cells
and then you keep gaining weight and
those two fat cells divide and so on and
so forth and here's the deal
when you lose a bunch of weight later
after you've made all the cell division
all the cells shrink but they don't die
they're always around
they shrink down real small so you can
be lean again but the number of cells
that you have
is very very well connected to it's
causing
a variety of hormonal uh and other
factors
to be differently regulated or different
different
differently regulated in the body i got
it maybe you don't have to cut that out
scotty i got this
so the different regulation results in
the following
if you have more fat cells you tend to
be hungrier if you have more
fat cells your settling point and set
point tends to be higher
forever this has been shown very well in
folks that have lost
lots and lots of weight unfortunately
the vast majority of those people
will go back up to their previous weight
within a year's time
and most of those people that keep the
weight off keep it off to some extent
but not to a complete extent
the more fat cells you have in number
the higher the drive
is to get back to your earlier fatter
appearance
the same thing is true in muscle tissue
by the way if you have satellite cells
that have been integrated into the
myonuclear domain
right they have actually entered muscle
cell and and added their nuclei
once you have that even if you stop
lifting weights and your muscles shrink
when you start lifting weights again
your muscles blow up
way faster like an order of magnitude
faster than you would expect
regaining lost muscle size is like snap
easy a couple months of training
and you're damn near as big as you ever
were you could have quit for years i
mean it's unbelievable rates of muscle
growth when you come back
why because you have all those nuclei in
there ready
to integrate tons of muscle mass into
their structures because they're all
there and turned on
they never leave fat cells is the same
thing they're independent cells but the
more nuclei you have because cell
division causes more nuclei
the more that as soon as you start to if
you fall off your diet
and you have five fat cells you'll gain
weight and then as the cells get big
they start to really shut down hunger
activity and you're like good god if
you're trying to gain weight on purpose
you're like i don't even want to eat
anymore
but if you have a bunch of fat cells
they're like yeah bring on the food and
as you eat they get bigger and bigger
and bigger and they divide again bigger
and bigger and so on and so forth so
if you want to make permanently
difficult for yourself to get lean
and stay leaner then gaining a ton of
body fat at any one time is a great idea
if you want to alter the way your body
looks and your skin shape it's also a
good idea but those are all really not
great things
i can't emphasize this point enough
all of this stuff especially the
permanent stuff from high body fat gain
is not something you want to burden
yourself with
probably one of the biggest pieces of
epidemiological
advice or epidemiologically informed
advice someone could give you
about how to make sure you don't end up
obese
is don't become obese in the first place
okay as soon as you're dealing with
someone who's a very high body fat you
already have a host of
really nasty um considerably intractable
problems and tractable means very
difficult to change
right that's a bad thing as i said
someone comes up
it's almost like um you know once you
i'm sure
many of you folks played sports once you
have like an injury and like your knee
your knee gets to feeling good but if
it's a bad enough injury it never
quite feels the same again and you're
always a little bit concerned about me
it could be years ago
but some scar tissue there so on and so
forth especially if you heard it a
couple of times it's just
never back to 100 percent gaining a ton
of body fat
does that to your metabolic system to
your proclivity for fat gain
and to your your body shape so on and so
forth it's just nothing you want to sign
yourself up
for right and i myself i had done this
process where i got
really really way over fat and i'm still
dealing
with a variety of these issues i mean
they're not a huge deal because i didn't
go
super overboard but i wish i would have
done less real important point there
so where does this leave us with sort of
gain rates and targets well
gaining from 10-ish percent body fat to
somewhere between 15 and 20
uh myself and some of the other folks in
our industry some other experts we have
a very very good lively debate about
what that number should be or how
expansive that range really is
i'll say this if someone says 15 is a
hard stop
they're probably over exaggerating the
data you can gain to 16 17 18
no problem it's not too much fat you'll
be just fine if you're a competitor
you're probably in bodybuilding or
physique you probably want to get too
much above 15
as a male this is just a huge road down
right unless you
do a double pump diet or something like
that uh
once you're over 20 fat gee you know it
starts to be a hard difficult process to
justify especially if you're in physique
sport if you're a power lifter or weight
lifter thrower you might have some
justification
but if you're just doing mass for mass
sake anything above 20
for male seems not like a good idea for
females the numbers are maybe 15 to 17
as a bottom end because below 15 we tend
to see a
disruption of menstrual cycle so on and
so forth really really bad for muscle
gains and health
all the way up to probably about 30 in
females so if you're female and you want
to be lean and jacked
and someone says hey you should do a
muscle gain phase if you're like great
i'll get to 35
and that's probably a bit uh outlandish
i think keeping it to 30
is probably a decent idea for most folks
and
anything about 15 really 17-ish is a
good place to start
um really you've got to bring this up
because it's a sort of elephant in the
room
males and females are not the same they
are not identical thus they have
different recommendations
uh fortunately or not uh i guess it is
what it is but
the muscle gain part of the fitness
industry is mostly male dominated and
thus male focused and dominated not in
some nefarious sense but in the sense of
just most of the folks that want to put
on muscle
most not all happen to be male so a lot
of the guidelines coming out on body
fats and stuff
they're just not even being labeled as
male they're just labeled as here's the
percentage right and a lot of females
get into this sport
and they say well gee i need to get down
to 10 to accurately gain muscle i mean
i've met folks at seminars that say this
the thing is ten percent female is
ripped to shreds you can see the
striations in her jaw because females
have uh a fertility fat that doesn't
just
you know squish right off the body like
males do and
there's just baseline body fat is higher
and there's not a damn thing wrong with
that it's just a difference
so females have to be mindful of that a
15 to 17
body fat female is usually just going to
be pretty stripped up
and ready to gain awesome amount of
muscle and up to 30ish percent
females are very athletic very uh you
know there's no like fat
pouring over that sort of thing because
a lot of times people look at thirty
percent they're like oh my god thirty
percent i mean i'm not even remotely an
athlete
tons of female athletes are thirty
percent in that range it's totally fine
now when you get into the forties and
stuff you're clearly used a little bit
overboard but
make sure to take that in mind all right
so we know we can gain for a while but
we also know we need fat loss phases
every now and again
all right we know actually how long we
need to gain because the last time so
three to six months of gaining and then
probably a fat loss phase to get rid of
the stored fat and then maybe we can get
back to that again
maybe but it turns out maybe not because
of maintenance phases
so the question here is can we you know
mass and cut mass and cut mass and cut
up and down indefinitely yeah we could
but we run into some things
here's the thing point number one when
you are gaining muscle and
when you're losing fat the requirement
is that you train at minimum
at high ish volumes at least maybe not
always your highest volume certainly
during muscle gain you will at times
but something like minimum effective
volume and above
that by definition is a volume that is
net fatiguing
it is accumulatively fatiguing which
means
week after week month after month of
training above minimum effective volume
means your fatigue will accumulate and
at some point we'll get to really
unsustainable levels
you're gonna need a break from that kind
of training somewhere and here's the
kicker
you say okay great we'll take a training
break are you gonna take a training
break
that has you training at maintenance
volumes just to keep your muscle but
reduce fatigue
are you gonna take that break when
you're gaining weight well no because
you're just getting pure body fat i mean
literally by definition
maintaining muscle mass so when you are
hypercaloric
you're just going to gain pure body fat
so no
and then are you going to gain or sorry
are you going to take that break
or your maintenance phase during a
hypocaloric phase when you're
fat loss dieting well gee you know it's
real tough
to drop fatigue when you're hypocaloric
so again that's a no
it was all not a second we got we said
we can mascot mascot masculine
definitely but well clearly we can't
if we're training hard that means we're
going to have to have some point where
we're eating iso calorically
maintaining our body weight training
very easily
at least with lower volumes and letting
our fatigue dissipate
that's a real kicker all right so
that's point number one next
if we remember from the last lecture
there is such a thing
as preparatory growth versus contractile
tissue growth
not all mass gains are equal and early
mass gains
might not stick around if you supply
them in sub-optimal condition shortly
after
you have done a lot of preparatory
growth but after a while
you know if you're not doing a really
good job of continuing that growth it's
not going to get filled in with actual
contractile tissue growth that's going
to be sticking around
later right so basically if you gain a
bunch of mass and then just go right to
a hard cutting phase that lasts a long
time right after man you know you might
not keep all those gains and it'll just
be mostly preparatory at least some
preparatory growth that never converts
to actual
long-term growth not a good thing but
maybe if we take a maintenance phase
after we get up to that new body weight
hold it for a while we can still see
lagging residual hypertrophy
that is actual contractual hypertrophy
even though we're not in a hypercaloric
phase at least we're not hypocaloric and
definitely shutting down hypertrophy in
a big way
next point here is we might benefit from
a settling point readjustment we
mentioned this earlier in the last
lecture
of if you're going to gain muscle that
sticks you probably have to gain enough
weight
to be different than you were before
like notably or do you gain from 140 to
142 pounds like
gee your body can't even tell you put
anything on and go back to your old ways
of eating and
um when activity you're just going to go
back to 140 you might have gained a
little bit of muscle but it's not going
to be much
what you need to do is get up to a new
body weight say 140 to 150
and stay there for a while a couple of
months maybe maybe at least a month
really settle in get that preparatory
growth to be contractile growth
really recharge that settling point so
that your body thinks you're really
supposed to weigh 150 or close to it
and when you do a fat loss phase and
just balloon right down to the weight
you always weight
right definitely some food for thought
there maybe not a good idea to just go
right into a fat loss phase after a gain
phase
now last point here it's not a major
point
but it definitely has some consideration
psychologically if you're always either
bulking or cutting bulking or cutting
bulking or cutting
you're always doing something you're
always on a mission to go
somewhere you're always forcing
something that your body doesn't want
you're never at homeostasis think about
it
you're if you're gaining you're always
giving your body more food than it
really wants
okay disruption what about if you're
losing fat well you're restricting food
that your body
wants to eat but you can't physiology
aside that is psychologically burdensome
right at some point you just kind of
want to chill
an example here is this going to work
right tough weighs on you you need a
break
what if your idea of a break is hanging
out with tons of friends and going to
parties it's a great time it's super fun
but that kind of an offense is also
burdensome it's not the same kind of
burden as work totally
but you know you got to call everyone
tax to everyone get people together go
to the club
clubbing is fun but you got to move
around a lot drinks who's buying blah
blah blah
late nights it's fun but it wears on you
how many of you guys have ever been in a
situation where you're working hard
partying hard at some point you're just
like you know what
i need a day of just netflix
and just me you turn your phone off and
you just sit there and you're just like
oh my god
buffy the vampire slayer reruns have
never been better
we all need that every now and again
psychologically the analogy is every now
and again you're just
not massing anymore you're not cutting
anymore you're just maintaining
just settling in just training hard and
heavy but not at crazy volumes
you're not terribly worried about
gaining muscle mass or really altering
your diet you're eating much more like a
normal person just keeping your protein
in
it lets you really relax or really
recharge so that you can get into your
next phase
much more productively i think it makes
a lot of sense and a lot of you folks
are super hardcore the psychology stuff
will never even touch you but it's
something to
be concerned with especially for those
of you who coach your own clients and
help other people
yeah you might be a machine but not all
your clients might be machines so
maintenance phase every now and again
may be a good thing
so how does that bring us to a phasic
structure well
the long-term approach to gaining lots
of muscle
probably needs some gain phases right
clearly
that's how we gain our muscle probably
some maintenance phases to sort of pound
in the gains a little harder and give
ourselves a break
and fat loss phases to deal with the
accumulated fat so we really have sort
of three distinct things we need to do
when it's almost like if you're cooking
in a kitchen you have
three distinct phases of the meal prep
process that have to happen every single
time
there's like the shopping slash
arranging the cookware and you can't
make food without that
there's the actual cooking itself and
then there's the cleanup
i mean there's three distinct phases
they occur sequentially you're not
cooking food that you haven't bought yet
you're not cleaning up food if there's
nothing to clean
and you imagine like get you buy the
food and you switch the cleaning phase
but everything's clean the food's in the
fridge like ah i guess i messed that up
right
so there's a three-way phasic structure
that has a particular sequence get the
food cook the food clean
just the same way you put on the muscle
you maintain the muscle and relax a bit
you let the training volumes fall and
then you deal with the residual
very much like cleaning your kitchen of
cutting off that body fat that you
gained during the game
process and then you're back to square
one and you can keep going and you have
something
actually accomplished during that time
does that mean that all those phases
have to occur in exactly the order every
single time
not necessarily but generally there's
going to be that
order in that structure it's going to be
logically oriented and it's going to
cause the best possible gains
right do we always need to do
maintenance phases after muscle gains
probably not is this the order that's
always needed
probably not but it's good to keep these
concepts
guiding us right and at least guiding
our thinking
so that we say okay we've done this
phase i don't care what the you know the
dogma says
mass and the maintenance and then cut
what do i need after this phase okay i
just masked for a long time
but i'm pretty beat up from training
psychologically and physically my
volumes have been really high
i want to get rid of this body fat but i
feel like i need a maintenance phase and
boom it and
question answers itself right and if you
feel like you're doing a phase that just
doesn't make any damn
sense you're probably doing it wrong
right a lot of this isn't so much
common sense but it is logical it is
rediscoverable so you don't have to
memorize any of this stuff it's not
dogmatic
all right so what does mass gain look
like in real life i'm going to show you
a real complex example we're just going
to spot the trends that we see
so this is an example of post
bodybuilding show periodization
a person in phase 1 over here all the
way on the left is gonna start out
with a little green arrow and this is a
percent fat scale they start at five
percent fat
and then the top end is fifteen percent
fat and of course it's going to be some
muscle gain there and some fat gain
and um the duration here is really
actually very long each one of these
little hash marks is two weeks this is
like i don't know like an ungodly number
it's like ha
uh almost a year or something like that
right half a year
so post-show periodization looks
something like this you go through a
little bit of a gain phase right after
the show because you're super dieted
down
then you do a maintenance phase because
you're super fatigued from what
from going down for weeks and weeks and
weeks after a bodybuilding show
and then from training with high volumes
to get a little bit of muscle back after
the show your real fatigue that's a four
week maintenance phase
color coded in the blue there the number
two right and then what are you gonna do
well
you know your fatigue is down you're
still pretty lean notice we end that
phase that
maintenance phase at nine percent body
fat hey rock on that's pretty lean
we have tons of room to go up all the
way to 13 fat with that number three
arrow the green arrow
we gain lots of muscle so that's really
sweet and that's like a 12 week muscle
gain phase right
right there in the middle of things
pretty good what do we do after
what we said it's gain and then maintain
and then fat loss sometimes we can do
specialty phases called mini cuts and
we'll have much more videos we have a
whole book on mini cuts on an rp
right and they can serve as sort of
combination maintenance and cutting
phases their volumes are low enough to
re-sensitize some potential for growth
and volume
uh they don't burn a ton of body fat off
they just buy you a little more mass
phase
time by getting a little bit leaner so
you can get more out of it so we do that
a little
a mini cup phase and then we do another
phase of going
up and gaining uh much more muscle and
some fat
then we find ourselves at 15 fat in this
male example
15 fat okay it's not the end of the
world you know let's see if it's a
bodybuilder that's probably about as far
as we'll go
we do uh we've got some good fatigue now
not a ton because we haven't been
gaining for months and months and months
it's just been you know like
12 weeks eight weeks not a terribly long
time and remember that mini cut was
probably a little bit lower volume that
bought us some time
but now we can't just do a mini cut
again we got to do a maintenance phase
it's just two weeks just to cool adjust
a little get a little bit
of uh desensitization to training volume
sorry re-sensitization to training
volume
to take a little breath and not train so
hard
after that we can do another mini cut
potentially but now that doesn't buy us
much time
right phase number eight there we only
got four weeks of muscle gain remember
we really said that
anything under a month is a real bad
idea so a month is a hard limit
of there's no way we can do shorter so
now we have a really interesting
paradigm here we're like okay so if
we're just gonna go up and down up and
down up and down
you know we're not getting bought enough
time here to really have productive
massing phases because
if we bought enough time we'd have to do
a longer cut to get us leaner
to let us mass gain so that we wouldn't
end up way north of 15
what we do then we're nice and fatigued
we take a maintenance phase of four
weeks really drop fatigue and then
we take a 10 week fat loss phase this is
not a mini cut that's a real fat loss
phase
and we'll scoot over to the next slide
that phase continues there and it takes
us
all the way from roughly 15 body fat in
the last slide right at the beginning of
that fat loss phase of 10 weeks
all the way down to 10 and then
we're ready to begin that process pretty
much all over again
we take a maintenance phase of four
weeks why are we taking a maintenance
phase right after that 10 week fat loss
plan it's 10 weeks is a long time to
diet
we have a lot of accumulating fatigue we
want to drop a little of it
before we really have good high quality
training for 12 weeks straight on a mass
muscle gain phase again in that muscle
gain phase
a little bit of a mini cut another
muscle gain push maintenance
so on and so forth you can see the
structure so now that you know these
principles of periodization
that doesn't mean every program you
design is going to be the same it
doesn't mean it's going to look like
this one but you're going to design
programs you're going to say okay we're
getting in muscle for so long we might
do a mini cup maybe not
at some point fatigue is too high we
need a maintenance phase at some point
we're too
uh high body fat we need to do a fat
loss phase so on and so forth so it all
ends up being in a very logical
structure
uh you know there's a you know we could
do like or potentially
lay out this whole periodization and
talk about how to interact with
bodybuilding shows so on and so forth
that gets more into fat loss
periodization which would be another
course altogether
but basically here's the deal everything
about periodization in muscle gain comes
from constraints and from the logical
inferences of those constraints look
ideally i would love to sit here and say
we don't need to periodize for muscle
gain you just eat and train and grow
that stops working super well we have
problems that arise
that's like saying ideally would you
want a car that doesn't require
refueling either
battery recharge or any gasoline well of
course who the hell would deny that
nobody wants to argue that well we
should have cars we fueled because it
gives gas station employees jobs well
they could have 50 other jobs why the
hell are they wasting their time
the thing is there's a constraint that
power and energy are not free so we have
to charge our batteries
we have to you know put gasoline in our
cars that means we have to stop on the
freeway every now and again
that might be a good time to also use
the bathroom get some snacks so we have
the structure developing you drive your
car for long enough
and then runs out of fuel you stop drive
your car there's a stopping phase
and then there's a going phase and a
stopping phase and someone say like well
that's kind of arbitrary
like why are you just designing it that
way we didn't design it that way
it was developed because of necessities
because of constraints
it's because we can't mass forever we
get super fat and get all those
negatives
that we have the birth of fat loss
phases and because we can't
gain weight fat loss gain weight fat
loss infinitely because of fatigue and
training related problems and so on and
so forth that we have the birth of
maintenance faces
and when we sequence them all together
we get the best results that we possibly
can
in the real world not the ideal world
but the word that actually works and the
world gets more and more real for you
in muscle gain the more advanced you get
so when you're a beginner you might the
first two years you could just gain mass
and there's no problem
you're gonna have reality hit you in the
face with higher body fat
more resistant to training more likely
to fatigue and then you're going to have
to develop more keen strategies
such as these periodization ones to stay
ahead of the game and keep making
reliable gains
folks that's it for this lecture next
time we're going to talk about
super important concept how to adjust
your calories and macros
when all of this planning doesn't quite
fit
and you're not gaining fast enough or
you're gaining too fast
or your whatever results you're getting
are not good enough how do we make
adjustments
to the basic principles to keep you
coming back to the right track
or gaining on the right track see you
