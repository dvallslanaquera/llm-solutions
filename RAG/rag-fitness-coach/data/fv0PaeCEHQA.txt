r that may be the hardest eight reps of
85 lbs anyone's ever flat pressed aren't
you worried about people looking at you
and figuring out that you're weak and
then sarily bullying you after you leave
the gym 100% honestly I think that was
something I used to worry about a lot
and then I realized it's getting bigger
than everybody
accurate a lot of times guys will say
when they getting bigger and stronger
they kind of start fearing injury
because they're like well I have to
train like an explosive idiot and then
if I do that with 600 lb it's almost
certainly going to hurt me if it 500
didn't but with you as you're getting
bigger and stronger you're getting so
much more cluded on your Technique that
the relative risk of injury may actually
be going down this entire time yeah
