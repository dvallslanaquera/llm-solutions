hey folks dr mike israel here for the
last video in this mini series
on using the pump disruption and
performance to auto regulate your volume
warning this particular presentation is
very technical so if you're
a person who has friends if you're not a
nerd
go hang out with your friends instead
don't watch this video if you're a super
nerd you have nothing better to do
like me you have nothing but already to
make these videos you're going to have a
lot of fun
so let's get to the fun what are we
going to do today
we're going to review how the three
volume regulators of pump disruption
performance
inform our volume we're going to talk
about how to integrate them
and then we're going to talk about how
to apply that in the real world
especially in a simplified manner
so quality first the sets have to be
good technique
and they have to be close to failure for
any of the shit to work properly
but here's the thing just generally
independently of each other the volume
regulators are the proxies for how hard
we worked
tell us something about volume so in a
nice in isolation the pump
if you got no pump at all from training
whatsoever
uh it's probably not enough volume okay
if you got a good pump you're probably
really on track for volume
and if you've got a mega crazy pump
that's great but you got to watch for if
the disruption is too excessive
especially over the next several days
with delayed outside muscle soreness
disruption if everything is fine and
there's no disruption and you're
probably just not
uh doing enough volume if you're pretty
messed up that's probably pretty good
it's a good average to hit and if you're
cooked
and just completely debilitated that's
pretty good
but watch for performance because you
don't want to interfere with anything
on a performance basis lastly
performance
if you're hitting your plan progressions
super easy
way too easy you might not be doing
enough volume
if you're hitting your numbers with a
good appropriate challenge you're
probably right in there in that middle
track of really great volume
and if you're failing to hit your plan
numbers because you're so super fatigued
and messed up
it's almost definitely too much volume
right now
that's using them by themselves how do
we use them together
boy oh boy do we have a treat for you so
integrating the regulation of volume
from all three of these proxies
the pump quite simple you monitor the
pump
during the actual training like set to
set to set in the training itself
and the pump informs what you should do
be doing in that very
session itself so if the pump
is at least decent you're good to go
okay
so don't change any volume if the pump
is decent
and you could be more nitpicky and say
it's at least as good as last week
okay if you had a better pump last week
even if you have a decent pump
this time you might not be growing as
much as you could be if you had a better
pump
all right so with those two rolls you
plus a minus a set to get to where you
can check both those boxes
the pump's at least decent and it's at
least as good as last last week and you
keep doing
sets until you get there all right so if
you do one set
and nothing happens with your pump is it
decent no it's non-existent do more sets
if you do three sets and your pump is
decent last week how was your pump
better
okay this week maybe we do four maybe
okay
so first example here is let's say in
your first week of training you do two
sets of bench press
the pump is like meh then you do one
more and you reevaluate
another example is you do four sets of
curls in your second week of training
but so so far you've done four that that
literal session
your plan was five because last week you
did four and everything was fine so you
added a set
but the pump is just gnarly at four like
you finished four and you're like holy
shit
stop okay stop at four auto regulate
because you don't need that fifth one it
might just provide too much damage and
fuck up your disruption and fuck up your
performance
performance you wanna
check your overall performance for how
you did for that muscle group right
after you finish training so after you
finish the session of let's say chest
you want to see how your chest uh
performance actually did
relative to the week before and so on
and so forth and
based on just the performance you want
to jot down an idea of if you want to
increase decrease
or uh what you know what to do with
volume so
if the performance on chest was great
and like sort of way too easy you're
like okay like this was kind of a joke i
blew all my plant progressions out of
the water then you're probably under
dosing volume and
maybe plan to increase next week same
workout like monday chest next monday
chests
plan to increase by a set or two if your
performance is right on track you hit
your numbers and they were about as hard
as you thought they were going to be
no change leave your set numbers alone
and
if you're underperforming like you're
super fatigued you don't hit your
numbers
plan to use a recovery session
especially if next session also
underperforms here's the big deal right
monday you hit chest
and you had a shitty workout you
underperformed don't just make the next
session recovery session
try to go and hit it hard again on
thursday let's say this is your next
chat session
because it could just be a one-off on
monday sometimes you have shitty
workouts it doesn't mean your fatigue
super accumulated
just sometimes shit sucks so thursday if
you blow that workout out of the water
bucket
same number of sets monday uh next
monday is last monday
but if you start that workout and your
trust is so sore or you really
underperform again
for sure or recovery workout next monday
maybe even next thursday
for sure next monday and then maybe next
thursday start ramping it back up all
right pretty straightforward
so here are two examples for you guys uh
just just to play around with and these
are not uh
exhaustive examples there's many other
ways that can uh come out
but let's say you plan to hit 225 for an
average of 10 reps per set at two reps
in reserve
you show up you go two reps in reserve
but that actually meant you got 12 reps
per set
okay that meant like everything being
equal that was way too easy
and you probably just haven't been doing
enough volume to make your tired enough
and that means next week you can add
a set to the chest workout that preceded
this one so for example if you over
performed
this workout let's say was on a thursday
that we just did the 225 for sets of 12
like that means your monday chest
workout just really didn't cause a whole
lot of fatigue and probably because it
was under dosed with volume
so what you do is this workout that you
hit the 12s whatever that was fine
next monday this is the thursday work
that you just did when you go look in
your logbook okay next monday last time
i did three sets of chests
that didn't make me as tired as i
thought it would four sets
okay so that's what it was four sets on
monday the thursday will take care of
itself later
right another example because when it's
not it's not always
up or down set sometimes maybe most
times just leave the sets alone
you do let's say 130 pounds on a lap
hole down for 15 reps this week with an
average of rer
one so one rep in reserve last week you
look at your log book
you did 125 5 pounds less for two reps
in reserve
uh it looks like that's really good plan
progression is stable
you did let's say you know five sets
last time of flat pulldowns and five
sets this time
uh next time it's five sets right
because you're super on track
everything's going super well like
by itself right just with that
performance
uh regulation itself so
lastly is disruption okay you want to
monitor disruption during training
because like if your performance is
falling off like crazy because of local
fatigue that's the thing to take note
but you don't just stop at the current
training you monitor it all the way up
to the next training session for that
muscle group
so you monitor disruption on your monday
chest workout through the chest workout
especially towards the end when
disruption becomes evident
and then you monitor how perturbed you
are after how much soreness you get
after
if it's delayed onset it'll creep up on
you again and then you see
by thursday for the next chest workout
how much soreness how much disruption do
you still have could be zero
could be a little bit could be a lot so
on and so forth right
jot all that down and then for the next
week session
before that one you make the volume
alterations so
for example if you had
thursday okay thursday chest you show up
and you're like what is my level of
disruption
okay if you look back and you're like
man
that monday workout barely disrupted me
at all during monday and then i wasn't
even sore
next monday because you're doing this on
the thursday workout because finally
everything's for sure healed
you go okay next monday i'm not doing
two sets anymore i'm doing three you add
a set or add two because it was just not
enough
if when you're measuring for that
thursday you just healed on time
no change okay you did four sets of
chest monday you barely healed by
thursday whatever number of sets you do
on thursday
definitely don't increase monday just
keep it at four if you don't heal on
time we have a little bit of a
bifurcation here and again this is an
advanced lecture quite complicated
if you were just a little messed up
still and especially if your performance
went well
don't do anything about it just keep the
same number of sets like a little bit of
a twinge
in chest soreness but you hit all your
numbers and everything goes great not a
big deal nothing to worry about
definitely don't go up but you don't
have to go down you can just still do
the six sets or whatever you were gonna
do
if you were really messed up reduce the
volume of that prior session next week
so
thursday your chest is still fucked up
from monday to the point where it like
is really painful or really hurts your
workout
next monday don't do six sets like you
did maybe do four
okay because whatever you did monday
this past week was way too much
and you don't want that to happen again
right
so a couple more examples here so
example number one you did
six sets of quads in the last session
you hardly fatigued
your muscles felt fine the whole time
zero doms but this time you do one more
pretty simple right one more so seven
sets of quads in that next session
next example you do eight sets of
hamstrings i'm not sure would compel you
to do such a thing
um maybe well here's an example of how
this actually can happen
you've been doing hamstrings you've been
doing like six or seven sets but your
technique and your relative effort
haven't been that good
and you watched a doctor mike
renaissance producation video on
technique and relative effort and like
fuck yeah
so you extended your range of motion you
drove it close to failure you're really
focused on your hands
and also the good stuff and all of a
sudden you're like well this is working
great
and then you're like i should do eight
sets because this is awesome i figured
out how to train my hamstrings and then
you crawl to your car
and your hands are painful to the touch
and they're cramping like crazy
and they're still painful to the touch
when you have to train them next
so you do two things in that case one
is let's say this happened on monday and
on thursday you have to train hams again
and you're still fucked up
first thing reduce thursday to a
recovery workout if you need to
uh google youtube recovery workouts or
recovery sessions deloads and stuff like
that
we have tons of content on that from
earlier so definitely just go easy there
on thursday
and then next monday when you have to
train hams again
do like six sets do not do eight because
eight was clearly too much
right so
how do we finally see all of this in the
big picture and i have a really cool
little
um piece of art i drew
visual representation some of this is a
little bit complicated to see in your
head all at once
so you might want to pause the video
here read the shit on the slide and
really look at the slide
because it really does say a lot so
the pump guides decisions within the
session itself
okay and it affects the current session
so if you're doing
chest doesn't matter what you did last
week doesn't matter what you're going to
do next week if you're doing chest and
you don't have a good pump yet keep
going
if you already have a great pump you can
probably stop okay even if you did
whatever
last week and you planted or whatever
next week once you get a great pump it's
probably going to stop
if you get a skin splitting pump maybe
you have gone even a little bit too far
right performance guides the decision
right after the session finishes so if
you're a thursday chest
you know your performance of thursday
chest right after it's over and
it informs how you're going to modify
monday's
next chest workout so it's the session
right before it in the week
but that's next week now right and if
that's confusing just pause it just look
at this diagram it'll figure everything
out
and disruption lasts potentially all the
way up until your next session
so we notice that if you look at the
little diagram the disruption
is all the way up until this last
thursday's chest workout we measure
disruption
because maybe you're sore that long then
it also affects the session before or
rather the one next week so
if monday of this week fucked you up so
bad that thursday you were still sore
what you change is next monday's volume
not necessarily thursday's volume
because you could be just a little bit
sore and you can still get through it
that volume can change but that has to
be a performance change
so if you're pretty sore and you come
into the gym
and you're not exactly sure if you can
perform for most people the best guess
is this
just try because you could perform super
well and a one-time thing of being a
little too sore
um is not going to get you hurt or any
shit like that the risk for that is
super low
so try it and it could be a great
session but then next time you know
reduce the volume
right super super simple
so another way to put this
relatively simply when you begin a
session
you can ask the question of am i still
sore in that target muscle group
and you can use this info for the next
session you can see like if i'm super
mondo sore i'm just going to take a
recovery workout or i'm just a twitch
store let's see how it goes
and you can definitely use it for that
workout before in the next week so if
you show up to a thursday and you're
still sore from monday
next monday is going to have to change
somehow because that's an untenable
proposition to continue to train
soar all the time we call it overlapping
soreness
during the session in the first week of
the meso
you do as many sets as it takes to get a
decent pump and a decent level of
perturbation local fatigue like okay
i did something to my quads and that's
it
if it's any session that's not the first
week if you have numbers to compare it
to
then you plan to do the volume that you
had figured out from all the other
regulations so
last week you did five sets of leg press
and then you'd like whatever didn't get
sore or whatever and your performance is
super easy you plan to do six
still plan to do six but alter that
if it goes up or down in any way so for
example if you plan to do six
and after six sets you don't really get
much of a pump
i am maybe at seven just right there on
the other especially if you didn't get
super sore last time or anything there's
probably no downside on the other hand
if you're like my muscle connection is
really great if your technique has
really improved if you really bring the
psychology that day
you might do like four or five sets of
leg press and be able to fucking barely
move my legs this is the
biggest pump i had my entire life it
doesn't matter that you did six last
time it doesn't matter that you plan to
do seven fucking stop at five
because anything more will probably just
be excessive damage so there's
opportunity for our regulation there
right after the session then you ask the
question
of how was my performance okay did i
perform
way too easy if that's the case next
week we add a little bit
if it's right on track we don't change a
thing and the performance is really like
on a string we definitely don't increase
and if the performance was a disaster we
have to execute recovery sessions
because we're probably too close to our
rv or even beyond
now this right here is right from the
scientific principles of hypertrophy
book if you really want to just destroy
all these concepts in your head
and get them super deep just buy the
book and read the shit
but if you just want to stare at the
screen for a while
this is available look here it's on
youtube for free with not much
explanation except for what i just said
this is the algorithm you can use to
figure out depending on how sore you got
and depending on your sort of disruption
on one scale and your
performance on another how many sets to
add whether to add sets at all and if
and when to do recovery sessions this is
it
okay and the pump isn't in here
because it modifies these values because
for example
if we use this uh little chart here and
it says okay you never got sore
point zero and each set was much easier
than planned
it says add one to three sets next week
so how to use the pump well here's the
cool thing right it says add one to
three sets that's fucking arbitrary shit
it's a big range when you get to that
next week let's say you did four sets
the week before it says add one to three
so that could be five sets
or it could be seven cents who the fuck
knows start training watch your pump
if you get to set number five and your
pump is awesome stop then there's your
one of one to three
if you get to set number five and your
pump is like meh do another one if your
pump is awesome stop at six
and potentially if you get all the way
up to six sets and your pump is still
like
and like the disruption the fatigue just
isn't there the perturbation isn't there
then what you do is you look fuck it at
seven then it's one to three
then it's three okay so you use the pump
and a little bit of perturbation as well
to guide you within this framework seems
complicated
but we can absolutely simplify it right
if you want to be super meticulous yeah
you can use the very specific guidelines
we've presented so far
pause the video on this um on the chart
there print the screen if you have
hypertrophy book you get this
anyway if you want something simpler
there is simpler advice and here it is
if your training makes you barely sore
and your performance is
way above your plan goals add a set or
two next week because you're probably
not training with enough volume
if your training gets you nice and sore
and you hit your performance on track a
little bit
you know every week you're fucking
golden don't mess with your set numbers
if your training wrecks you and makes
you underperform
reduce the sets and consider a recovery
session to get back on track
sometimes you've accumulated so much
fatigue that just lowering in the next
session to a normal amount of training
isn't good enough you way too much
fatigue
right like if you uh here's a good
analogy if you're like making food in
the kitchen you just fucking have just
dirt everywhere because you're a real
piece of shit about it you're doing that
italian pasta tossing thing and pasta
just fucking goes everywhere and so does
the sauce
the burners are on fire because there's
pasta and sauce in them if you're in
that position
yeah if you're like okay this is stupid
what am i doing you can just go back to
cooking normally and not like an asshole
and just mixing the pasta
in the pot without doing this you could
do that but
if you have enough fatigue if there's
enough pasta and sauce in the burners
and shits on fire
before you do that you got to clean some
shit up okay so it might be like if
you're really really high fatigued
next session isn't just normal a little
less volume next session might need to
be a recovery session and then only next
week
do you get back to doing uh normal stuff
but a little bit more moderate because
you knew that
this number of sets you got up to maybe
seven cents way overkill
next week you go to four but later this
week you'll go to just two or three sets
with a light load really recover give
your body some breathing room and then
start to go back in to what is much more
reasonable as far as volume
whatever number of sets this logic plans
for you
when you show up to the gym you can use
the pump and to some extent perturbation
and fatigue
to figure out how to modify that so you
say okay
with all these things taken into
consideration this week monday
leg press should be about five sets you
go in you start doing the sets
if it's set three because of your
awesome mind muscle connection your pump
is fucking toasting you
stop if you get to five sets and your
pumps met
especially compared to last week feel
free to do another one and reevaluate
and so on and so forth if the pump is
unbelievable
but you have more sets planned and
especially if it's like a skin
stretching pump
don't chase the shit and keep going okay
you want a really great pump but there
is such a thing as too much
that workout will go great to be the
best workout you ever had but the next
workout might not so
if it's your last week of accumulation
and it says you should be doing seven
sets and you get to set six and you have
a gnarly pump fuck it do set seven get
the pump of your life
because next week you just get to
recover the entire time you get some
super compensation that's delayed
excellent muscle growth but if it's the
middle of your program or the beginning
don't get greedy about the pump just go
for good pump don't let the modifier
give you more volume because it'll
it'll damage you excessively you might
not grow much and it'll also add a ton
of fatigue and you'll really short stop
yourself
folks that was a lot of shit hopefully
it made some sense if it didn't comment
if it did comment either way comment god
damn it
the algorithm folks i sit here in front
of you not in a lamborghini that's a
problem
successful youtubers have lamborghinis
that's what youtube taught me
am i not a successful youtuber buy me
lamborghini
click on ads buy gymshark shit or v
shreds or what the fuck
they do uh kind of ads they do funny
story before i let you guys go
my dad watches a lot of my youtube
videos as you look proud of me and shit
which is fucking sweet
and uh that's great right i don't know i
think he listens to what i say
maybe but he doesn't lift weights or
anything so you give a flying fuck and
he's super smart he's like a physicist
or whatever but i don't think he gives a
flying fuck
but for some goddamn reason and this is
how awesome the algorithms are
and how well the shit has designed ui ux
because he's like afraid of computers
in many cases he clicks on the ads
all right so so my dad literally called
me be like oh misha how are you my
russian name is miesha
and he'd be like oh you know we'll
bullshit for a while he's like hey like
you know what do you think of like you
know like dr axe or whatever i'm like
what the fuck like why why like what do
you think about him he's like well
you know he's advertising some kind of
miracle supplement on one of your videos
and i clicked on it and
it looks really convincing i'm like no
my dad's clicking on v shreds ads people
be like my dad click on the ads buy new
lambo see you next time
