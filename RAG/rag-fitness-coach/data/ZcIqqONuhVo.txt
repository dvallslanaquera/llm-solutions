number one is to standardize your good
technique there's two problems
potentially there one you don't know
good technique you don't know how to
retract your shoulder blades and arch
your back if you need help on that
YouTube has like an Infinity videos on
bench press technique literally just
find any two or three of them
all the points that these videos agree
on
just write down on a napkin and
just do and almost all of them are gonna
agree lack talking and elbow flare and
all this other stuff fine at least learn
how to retract your shoulder blades get
your chest up arch your back and get
proper position
so first learn the right technique and
second of all practice that good
technique and make yourself technically
mindful so that every repetition looks
pretty much the same
every set looks the same every week
looks the same
