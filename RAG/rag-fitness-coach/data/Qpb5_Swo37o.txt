hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance production
rp
plus rpu and really the whole world
right let's talk
about hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture number 12
detecting mrv and responding to it going
to skip the contents because this is a
pretty short lecture
pretty obvious uh what we're going to be
talking about
first thing is
why is detecting and responding to your
mrv important and we have to set the
stage
here's the thing when you hit your mrv
you can continue to train
it's just going to be really low quality
training which is to say that your
stimulus to fatigue ratio is going to be
awful and you expose yourself to higher
injury risk
and that's if you grow at all because
much past mrv
you use so much recovery resource that
it wipes into your adaptive abilities
and then you just don't adapt anymore
bad bad bad news right so
we really care about reaching our mrv
because all the stuff is bad stuff we
want to know
when we hit our mrv because when we hit
it we know it's time to reduce fatigue
we don't want to guess we want to have
an objective systematic way to detect
mrv that tells us
when we've hit it and in this lecture
we'll learn the planned responses we
have
to once we have detected it what do we
do about it right
and if we go back to the content slide
actually
were i've already uh talked about this
first point
why do we care so today we're going to
talk about
how to detect mrv via what's called the
set progression algorithm
and then we're going to talk about three
distinct actions you can take
based on how mrv detection actually
occurs
and then a few implications here we go
detecting mrv via the set progression
algorithm here's the set progression
algorithm slide number four
if you guys want to pause your video
screen
and look at it for a while it'll help
because it's
it looks a little bit complicated i
promise it's super super simple but if
you want to pause here for a bit and
look
highly recommended so you are super
super on the money with the rest of
everything we talk about but essentially
the set progression algorithm asks two
questions
how sore did you get from a certain
training session and during that
training session
for that muscle group that you're
targeting how is your performance
okay we're gonna have a one through four
scale in each one
so let's go through soreness first a
number one rating on the soreness and
we'll talk about in the next slide how
to interpret these ratings so don't
worry about how to interpret them
just let's be concerned of what they're
asking
if you were asked how sore did you get a
number one response would be that you
didn't get sore
at all a number two response is you got
stiff for a few hours or maybe a sore
for next day or so
but you healed well in advance of the
next time you're going to train the same
muscle group no problems at all
number three is if you got delayed onset
muscle soreness
or if you train really frequently you
got some muscle soreness right after the
training
but you healed completely just on time
for your next session
if your sessions every day six days a
week that means
never when you were training biceps six
days a week were you carrying any
soreness from another day
that sort of thing if you train your
legs twice a week that means you could
have gotten really really sore
from a monday session but by thursday
when you train your quads again your
quads feel
totally fine no perceived source
whatsoever number four
is the easy one to detect it is you got
delayed onset soreness
and you still had it in any way shape or
form when you hit that muscle group
again in its next session so you hit
legs on monday hit quads
they got sore by thursday you got in
they're still sore that's a number four
response
what about performance these are a
little bit more technical but i promise
they're much simpler than they look
a number one performance is you hit your
target reps that you were going for
with two reps in reserve more
of what you had planned for that week so
for example you were trying to hit
a hundred pounds for 10 reps last week
and you got it for three reps in a
reserve and this week you're pushing the
pace you want two reps in reserve
you go up to 105 pounds and you're like
i want to hit 10 hopefully that'll be 2
r
but a number one is if it was 105 pounds
you did hit it for 10
but i if you had to be honest it wasn't
too r it was four r like it was way
easier
than what it was supposed to be that you
rank as a number one kind of performance
right if you're increasing reps versus
so you're you're using the same weight
but going up in reps
this to target a certain r let's say i'm
gonna go one from fail last week i did
15 reps with 100 pounds
this week with 100 pounds i want to do
uh
17 reps if instead of 17 you hit 19 or
more reps and that was really two
reps in reserve you way over performed
that's a number one
notice you're starting to see a pattern
here number one from soreness as you can
get so at all
number one in performance is you just
blew your performance out of the water
do you think the training volume you're
doing in the last session or last week
is very high
it's not very high so clearly we're
probably going to raise
training volume uh if we're really just
not getting sore at all and we're just
having rockstar performances because you
could do more and still benefit
number two on performance you hit
uh right at the planned rar or one
better
right so your performance is one rep or
or
one rar point above what you thought you
thought you were going to hit something
for two reps in reserve
uh at a certain uh predetermined number
of reps and weight
but you hit it at three reps in reserve
or two reps in reserve
you thought you were going to get 15
reps this coming week and you got 15
reps or 16 weeks
about the same performance maybe a tiny
bit better it's a
better or uh equal or just a tiny bit
better nothing crazy that's a number two
number three is you still matched all
your numbers and you still hit your
targets
but at a slightly lower rar than
expected
so for example the last week you hit 15
reps
this week you wanted 17 you got it you
were supposed to be at two reps in
reserve but you got to be honest that
17th rep that took you to one reverend
reserve
you still hit all your numbers you
didn't technically underperform because
if we look at your sheet of how much
you did and how many reps and sets you
didn't wait we say okay like you
actually perform the same as last time
or better
[Music]
but you had to sacrifice some reps in
reserve and remember representatives are
a finicky concept you're not
positive about it what you can say is
like it's not all hunky-dory anymore you
had to fight for
getting those reps maybe a little too
hard and number four is really
straightforward no matter what rar you
just couldn't match your last week's
reps
right and or you couldn't have the rep
progression that you wanted
right or so sorry any case it's actually
just you can't match your
last week's reps so for example you did
100 pounds last week for 10
this time you do 105 pounds and you get
eight or you get seven you get nine
and you went all the way to failure to
get all the all nine of those reps
and it didn't matter what our ir was
that is a distinct that is not in a
subjective underperformance that is
object if you tried as hard as possible
you still couldn't do it
so that's number four okay
so basically we have these indices that
tell us how so we're getting and when
we're recovering
and what our performance is like all the
way from really exceeding expectations
really exceeding expectations all the
way to
being just about as much as we want out
of performance as could expect
all the way to we're distinctly just
falling behind what do we do with these
actually really straightforward if
both performance and soreness register
once which means we'll go back really
quick
you didn't get sword all and you blew
your performance out of the water by a
few reps or way way shy of the r you're
supposed to
consider there's nuance here adding two
or three sets to the same session next
week
right so for example if
you did leg presses on thursday
and you are doing squats on monday
okay and when you do your squats
you remember that leg presses barely
there's a leg press has never made you
sore on thursday
and your squats on monday you blew out
of the water
gee you know next thursday it's time to
add probably two or three sets to leg
presses because whatever you did in that
leg press workout
didn't remotely push you to any of the
extremes and pushing to the extreme
slowly judiciously is how we make
progress
so if you're hitting ones all the time
you're just training with too little
volume
it's just too easy
if you get ones and twos and it doesn't
matter which one's one or which one's
two
you can consider adding about two sets
maybe one set maybe two maybe three
but not like the two or three for sure
we're not being as bullish you're
probably still gonna want to add sets
but maybe like
an average of two and sometimes fewer
what if you get both twos let's look
back at what two is
you got stiff for a few hours or after
and you got a bit sore the next day okay
um but you healed way on time good and
then you hit your target reps a little
bit ahead of schedule or just
your performance was a little bit better
than it was supposed to be or just about
as much as it was supposed to be so
things are good
but they're not great which means if you
hit both twos
consider adding one or two sets to the
session on which you're performing this
analysis so like
with the leg presses like yeah you know
you hit your squats about as well as you
thought
and you did get sore from your last leg
press workout but like it healed pretty
quick
so you know you can add one or two sets
i wouldn't go adding three sets because
they could take you way over
the top right really really
straightforward stuff
twos and threes you can consider adding
between zero and one set so
distinct possibilities you just repeat
the same number of cents right
threes both of uh performance and sort
of give you threes
is don't add any sense let's take a look
at the three just to remind ourselves
about us so
this is where you don't add any sets and
if it's just one of these other three
you might add one set but no more than
one set and a lot of times you don't add
any let's see three for soreness you got
to lay down some muscle soreness
and you healed completely just on time
for your next session for that muscle
group that's a big deal right
because you could say okay i did my leg
presses on thursday by sunday night i
was completely recovered in my quads
monday i started doing squats if you
add volume to that
what are the chances you're gonna get so
sore next time that it bleeds right into
monday
pretty good but if you had one set maybe
you'll be okay
probably because your body adapts over
time anyway but i wouldn't go adding two
or three sets that'd be a real really
bad idea
what about for performance here's the
real kicker both of them three
you hit your target reps at a lower
respected
lower rar than expected that's closer to
failure than you wanted to go
so that means it was a little bit too
challenging which means
that if you add a set you can probably
do it because your body adapts pretty
quickly but you got to be real careful
and probably if it's both three right
the recommendation is if both of them
are three don't add any signs
so if you barely scratch by a good
performance
don't add any sets keep the sets the
same because if that happens
what you end up having is
you essentially are saying to yourself i
survived
barely let me not change anything
let my body adapt a little more so that
next week i can survive
either still barely which is good
success or a little more and then maybe
next week i'll add a set right we don't
want to bull rush set additions
to where you're just adding adding
adding adding and then you just crap
yourself out of the back end and you
have to deload in two weeks anyway right
we got to be really really slow about
adding sense because we don't want to
overdo it we want quality training
heals on time and keeps our performance
the same or slowly elevates it
we don't want training that goes like
this with volume and then we fall off
the end
that's not high quality training so if
it's both threes don't add any sets now
you might be wondering
not included in this description is like
what if you get a one
and a three right that's not even
covered here
that is going to be somewhere between
these two right
or between these two extremes so like a
one and a three sort of technically adds
up to a four
right and we can say that's roughly the
same thing as both twos so if you get a
one and a three
consider adding one to two sets but if
it's a three on the performance
uh you know maybe you'll be closer to
adding that one set maybe even zero
cents so
this isn't an exact map of what to do
every time
but you get the feel of it right and
that's the whole point is
the number of sets number like to add is
really sort of made up for lack of a
better term
uh but it's made up intelligently in
such a way that we know we're adding a
little bit
or a little bit more or adding pretty
aggressively so whatever an aggressive
addition is for you and we highly
recommend you start with these numbers
um you know if you're getting the higher
numbers and rankings
you add less or add nothing if you're
getting a lot of lower numbers you add
more or you add considerably you add
something
right here's where it starts to get
really unambiguous
if you get a 4 on soreness no matter
what
performance says don't add any sense
foreign soreness means you're still sore
when you're training again
not a sustainable thing too much damage
to cause optimal growth even if your
performance is increasing for whatever
other reason could be because
neurologically your efficiency is
improving your technique is improving
you're super motivated
doesn't matter we're there to cause
muscle growth and too much damage
interferes with muscle growth so if you
score any fours on performance it
doesn't matter if the other ones if
performance is a one
if you score a four on soreness you
don't add sets
repeat the sets and then the next week
you probably won't be a sore then you'll
maybe score three or score two and then
you might be able to add some weight
or sorry add some volume some number of
sets
lastly number four on performance which
is you couldn't match your last week's
reps
no matter the rir you just couldn't beat
last week or match it even
if that happens that is an mrv detection
that is the only part of this that
really detects mrv so the cool thing is
you use the sub progression algorithm
to auto regulate your volume which is
awesome but in addition to that the set
progression algorithm
also detects mrv so there is no mrv
detector algorithm it's all in one
really really cool once we've detected
mrv
there are a couple of ways this can fold
out and then we have a couple of actions
to take the first one is
of the three mrv actions so we detect an
mrv and it says local detection with
confounders let's see what that means
you had a number four on performance
okay
right you underperformed but you know
that you missed sleep a bunch of the
night before or you're going through a
super high stress time for the last
couple of days
or tons of non-hypertrophy physical
activity that's unusual for you you took
your friend up
and you said okay i'm gonna garden for
nine hours with you before i do legs
okay in other words you know that that
underperformance has a very good chance
of not being
because your chronic volume has been too
high
and especially the volume in your last
week or workout is too high
you think it's for some other kind of
reasons and this is no time to second
guess yourself and no time
to try to cheat and be like no i think i
can still do it be super super honest
like if
if honestly your life is going fine and
everything's fine and you're
underperformed look you should hit your
review no big deal no big deal
but if you can honestly say yourself
like look there's no way that was really
mrv because i
did basically i had to walk to the gym
for two hours my car broke down i
basically had heat stroke by the time i
went in
yeah it's probably not the volume that
did you in right so your estimate here
is your performance
might have been reduced not due to
excessive volume
in prior sessions so then what is the
recommended action there's two options
here
option one is you just do nothing you
finish your workout like normal
and you eat and train normally and then
check performance for that muscle group
next session so you have a really crappy
squat workout on monday
but then next thursday you go to leg
presses and because you never actually
hit your mrv
just had a shitty performance your your
leg presses go super super well on
thursday and then next monday your
squats go great and everything's fine
that happens
absolutely it happens which is why when
mrv is detected we're not automatically
oh my god describe everything deload
right we're like uh
maybe there's some nuance there right
however option number two just to be on
the safe side is remember
those same acute fatiguing factors like
working in the yard for a long time
having heat stroke
the ones that cause this bad performance
they might add a little bit too much
cumulative fatigue
and sort of short-circuit you days or
weeks down the line so what you might
want to do
is your next session so if you detect it
on thursday next monday
you might want to do a recovery session
just to really bring fatigue down for
that muscle group
so you take the volume you cut it
roughly by half you take the load you
cut it roughly by half
and adjust for that muscle and then you
resume normal training in the session
after so then after that you know
you do uh you know your squats are half
the load half the volume
on monday after you detected a leg press
performance
and then next time on thursday leg press
you go back to the same old same old
progression
and chances are you'll be just fine
that's
if something confounded and that's if
the mrv wasn't truly reached is just a
bad performance for other reasons
however our second option is local
detection of mrv
without confounders so basically this
how this plays out
you hit a number four in performance
which means you don't match your
performance from last time
your recovery is good your diet is good
your stress have all been normal
and the volume you've been pushing in
the last several sessions or weeks
is in the high range for you
historically like for example if you
normally train your biceps between 10
and 20 sets per week 20 being the really
extreme high end close to your
mrv if you had a couple weeks of roughly
12 sets of biceps and everything else is
normal
and you have an under performance gee
it's probably not the volume
you know but if you last week you did 18
sets of total biceps and then this week
you hit mrv
uh g you know or sorry this week you hit
number four under performance
it probably is your mrv right it
probably is the fact that you're not
tolerating this volume
and that's probably going to be we have
to do something about it so
the estimate here from number four
performance being down but everything
else is fine
is your performance might have been
reduced because you hit the local
muscles mrv and then we have a very
distinct recommended action
your next half week which depending on
how many times you train a muscle
can be between well g one and three
workouts right if you train two to six
times a week
so next half week means you detect an
mrv let's say on
monday and you normally train monday
tuesday
for that muscle group monday tuesday
thursday friday on
monday you detect that you know
something's off
you would actually train hard again on
tuesday grind through it
and then thursday friday that's the next
half week
you drop that to recovery sessions half
volume
half of load super easy lots of recovery
for that local muscle
and then the next week you resume the
normal load
normal amount of weight on the bar but
you change your volume a little because
if you just did the same volume again
you'd just be at your mrv again and you
have to deload right after that so
here's what you do
you started in the first week with
roughly your minimum effective volume
and then you hit your mrv right here and
then you had a recovery session here
recovery half week
and then you're asking what volume
should i do now well you're adapted to
volume pretty much
pretty well for that exercise but you
just had a recovery session or two so it
de-adapted you or desensitized you to
volume or sorry re-sensitized you
and also but you know there's it's
probably somewhere in the balance there
so what are you gonna do what you're
gonna do is you're gonna take the volume
halfway between these two points
right from week one to your last week so
for example
week one you hit ten cents okay uh
for a muscle group for that week week
four which is when you detected
your uh you know this under performance
you hit
18 cents okay so the next week after
your recovery half week you're going to
do
14 cents and then you just repeat normal
training as as always and you keep
moving up
remember the load still goes up
predictably so if you're like pricing
300 pounds last week you hit mrv with
300
next week after the recovery sessions
are over uh you're going to do
305 pounds just like you were planning
right
lastly systemic detection
you have a number four on performance in
a local muscle group
but a few other things also happen at
least another
unrelated muscle also hits number number
four performance
in that last week right so for example
you hit a number four uh performance
uh decrement on biceps but also your
chest hit a number four like that
thursday
and the wednesday before your quads hit
it something like that right
that's a sign that everything's going
down the drain which is to say systemic
in addition to that another helpful hint
is if your sleep mood and appetite
desire to train etc are all
indicating systemic overreach right you
can go back to lecture 10
to figure out how to gauge those but
it's really really straightforward like
you feel like total crap
and your biceps aren't performing and
your chest and quads are underperforming
g you know your estimate here is that
your performance might have been reduced
probably because you've hit your body's
systemic mrv
and also possibly the local mrv of that
muscle
recommended action here is for
continuity finish out the rest of this
week
right unless it's like a monday you
detect mrv and you're falling apart then
you can deload
but if it's middle of the week or later
finish out the week grind
okay there's times to grind in training
and then do a
full deload week in the next week after
that
full deload week is the first half of
the week is like roughly 90
load or like your week one load 50 of
the volume
and the second half of the week is like
a recovery half week 50 load 50
volume same idea and then after that
deal is over you start a new mesocycle
fresh
which means you go back to minimum
effective volumes you
probably change some rep range ratios
around you might change some exercises
and even priority muscle groups which
are training less and training more
okay that's really it here's the deal
with the set progression algorithm
you know when mrv's been hit and with
those recommended action options
figuring out if okay we've sort of hit
mrv we suspect we've hit mrv we've hit
number four under performance
we now know what to do about each
circumstance and here's the thing
we don't know exactly what to do about a
circumstance we can't be exactly certain
but if you play the conservative game
and make sure you're not over guessing
your abilities and be like nah i'm fine
i'll just perform better next week
and if you interpret all these things
properly probably
95 percent of the time you're going to
know exactly what decision to make
which is really awesome because you can
stop the guessing game of asking
yourself when should i deload
when should i recover when should i take
a recovery session when a recovery
halfway
now you have objective quantifiable
answers to those questions
to allow you to train more like a
machine and thus
look more like a machine which is why
we're all here folks
see you next time for lecture 13.
