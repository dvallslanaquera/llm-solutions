yo
tricep skull crusher mistakes and how to
fix them
we've got joey sat mary of sat strength
on youtube check out his channel
it's probably better than this one to be
completely honest but while we have him
he's going to show us how to skull crush
wrong possibly dying in the process
and how to do it right possibly becoming
immortal let's get into the first
mistake and how to correct it
just to clear something up this isn't so
much a mistake but a very very important
uh sort of theoretical basis to place
before we talk about skull crushers
there's actually two different pretty
different variations of skull crusher
and neither one of them is right or
wrong they just do slightly different
things
option number one is the behind the head
skull crusher
which ideally you would touch the bench
behind you and come all the way up joey
can you show us that one real quick
so normal technique elbows stay in
he's gonna go behind his head gently
touch the bench
for a standard range of motion and come
all the way up and then repeat it one
more time
just for technique purposes so that's
option number one okay and then without
racking joey show us option number two
this one
you touch down to roughly around your
nose is a good start some people can
even do the chin
some people it's the forehead but it's
not the behind the head version
it's the actual face crusher version go
ahead and rat joey that's good enough
so which one of those is right or wrong
neither they just do something slightly
different
so here's how to use them if you want to
hit the back of your tricep a little bit
more
hit the long head then you can do the
skull crushers
that touch behind yourself if your
shoulders and elbows feel
okay with it for some folks that causes
either a bit of
uh shoulder discomfort or often a lot of
elbow discomfort and they'll write the
skull crusher off completely as being
like i can't do this
it hurts my elbows i used to be one of
those people the thing is
hitting long head happens with every
single pulling exercise you do
and standing overhead uh tricep
extensions hit that even better than
this exercise does
but this is still a great option if you
like it if you feel it in your tricep
super awesome use it away the other
option
where you bend at your elbows keeping
them close together
and you touch somewhere on your face is
totally cool
it actually stretches your tricep a bit
more towards the distal end
totally fine to do as well if that feels
better if you get better tricep pumps
from it if you get a better perception
of tension in your triceps if you get a
better burn
that's the one you can be using and you
can always use both
just label them as different exercises
do a few months of one and a few months
in the other
so when folks say well you know you're
touching a face that's not a skull
crusher it sure as hell is
some people get it confused with the jm
press the skull crusher
is when you come straight up and down
but you're touching somewhere on your
face
the jm press is usually when you touch
your chin or really sort of
go into your neck area and then you
don't press straight up you press
up and forward it's a hybrid between a
close grip bench
and a skull crusher to your face so
that's a jam press different exercise
also a really good one not the topic of
this video but yes
touching your face is still a skull
crusher you don't have to go behind your
head
both are totally fine
first mistake in the skull crusher once
you've picked a variation you like
is using a partial range of motion okay
the
oftentimes what people do with skull
crushers is they end up getting into a
middle range of motion and doing these
little pump wraps go ahead
joey and show us what's going on there
so
they're gonna go down and up sort of
like yeah get a good tricep pump
but they're missing out what are they
missing out on two things
one full motor unit recruitment to make
sure
that you know extending your elbows
forcefully recruits a whole lot more
motor units in your triceps
than just this middle range and going
all the way down for a deep stretch
stretches the muscle under tension which
itself produces lots of hypertrophy
there is at least one study on skull
crushers
that show slightly better results in the
higher rep range
from a group that did the weird partials
versus a full range of motion group i
would not invest heavily into one study
on all the other muscles of the body
every other study pretty much shows that
full range of motion is better than
partials
you don't want to be the person that
bases their whole training philosophy on
one quirky study doesn't make a whole
lot of sense anyway
only to have another study come out and
refute that one and then you're left
holding your own nuts
like usual so our best bet here
is absolutely to do a full range of
motion now
if you don't lock out completely and
rest between reps
you can get a ball or metabolite effect
which is what they attributed the
results of the study to
but you could still for sure go all the
way down and just
stop just showing a lockout and then go
all the way back down show us what that
looks like real quick joey so
instead of doing super partials you can
do all the way down
gently touch your nose and come all the
way almost to lockout and then right
back down
without a pulse so do it sort of a
little quicker julian right back down
and then up and right back down perfect
that's a ton of metabolite stuff that's
option number one hold the bar for a
second
option number two if you really want to
crank the metabolites in skull crushers
is actually to use the lockout and rest
so you're going to do a set where you're
going to barely lock out
and then you're going to take a break
right there and breathe for a couple of
rest so joey pretend to do us
you know a couple reps partial lock so
full range of motion
and then let's say he gets really tired
he's almost a failure lock out
take two or three deep breaths
metabolites are still cooking and then
you go
again for another little mini set that
will allow you to get way more ups good
enough perfect you can rack that way you
can get way more repetitions
you can fry your triceps on metabolites
so what you might not want to do
is a set where you go all the way down
and lock and rest and all the way down
and lock and rest and all the way down
and lock and rest that's really good
from a tension perspective
but maybe the metabolite response isn't
as great the hypoxia isn't as great
you won't get as much so what i
recommend is to do skull crushers in a
sort of organic fashion full range just
don't milk the lock out a ton
and then when you're resting breathe
breathe breathe and do it again
and then again and then again until you
really can't do any more venrac
that's a mega super awesome set that's a
a coin term by the way once you've got
that going
you're gonna get awesome tricep pumps
awesome activation and you still get
that
awesome awesome full range of motion
the next mistake in skull crushers just
like with many exercise
is an uncontrolled eccentric
uncontrolled descent remember the
eccentric contraction
slowing against gravity resisting
gravity provides an
awesome muscle growth stimulus and it
keeps you safer
for two reasons one you're less likely
to get in any joint trouble by having to
reverse the weight super quick
make it under uh more slow and control
and two it's a skull crusher
if you really dive bomb these things
you're gonna break your face sooner or
later you may already be considerably
unattractive just like me
but for the love of god facial
reconstructive surgery still costs lots
of money
folks think about the economy joey show
us what a dive bomb skull crusher looks
like hopefully he doesn't die doing this
so and then press and then sort of and
then press and really the big problem is
he misses out
on that essential contraction it's less
challenging this way
now show us what a real good scar
pressure looks like doesn't mean it's
super slow
notice it only takes him about one or
two seconds to go all the way down
but he's always in control that
literally means
more muscle growth stimulus perfect
the next mistake very related to range
of motion problems
is not having a consistent range of
motion almost all of your skull crushers
should go to a fully locked out or very
close position and come all the way down
generally you want to either touch your
nose or if you're doing the behind the
head version
touch the actual uh bench behind you
or at least some landmark like some part
of your skull that you know it's the
same one every time that way
you can track your reps better you can
apply overload better and you can know
if you're making progress versus being
like yeah i got 12 reps last week i'm
not really sure
if it's really like as good as the 12 i
did this week because i sort of cut some
of the range of motion on some of the
reps what does this look like in real
life
julie it all up for us and do some
weird skull crushers that are awesome
yeah
some are low some are high who the hell
knows a good skull crusher like joey's
doing now
hit it now with the right that was
really awful
so joey can fix this problem by simply
saying to himself two things one
i'm gonna lock up my elbows every single
time and i'm going to touch my nose
every single time
go ahead and hit it all the way up and
all the way down perfect and now there's
no question about how many reps to count
how to apply overload joey show us the
version where you touch all the way down
to the bench
so if you're doing the skull crushers
behind your head touch the bench every
time
and come up don't sit on that bench keep
the tension
gently touch come all the way up perfect
good enough and then you know how many
reps you did you know how to apply
progressive overload
the next mistake on skull crushers is
letting your elbows flare a ton
especially on the way down it's okay if
your elbows fell
a little bit on the way up because
you're just trying to get that weight up
as much as you can and you get a ton of
tricep activation doing it
but especially on the way down you want
to tuck your elbows in
so it's basically almost all triceps and
not a ton of chest
and front delt this is intentionally an
isolation exercise
is it okay to flare your triceps out if
you feel your triceps more that way
100 yes but if you're flaring out only
to get more reps because your pecs can
help
that's really violating the purpose of
the exercise which is to make it a
specific exercise for the triceps look
there's nothing wrong with getting your
chest involved but that's what dips are
for that's what close grip benches are
for
that's what jm presses are for in skull
crushers
we keep the elbows as close to the body
as we can now here's the thing
joey's a jack dude he's not
gonna be able to bring him i can't
 bring my elbows in super close
so it doesn't have to be your elbows
enough to go straight vertical but bring
them in as much as you can flush to your
body
especially on the way down joey show us
what a the wrong version looks like here
so people do skull crushers and they'll
sort of yeah and even if you go to your
nose
sometimes they'll just let the elbows go
way out and that really honestly just
lets you use your chest more
you can do more reps you can do more
weight but you're not here to train your
chest
to train your triceps you want to put
your elbows in see that rotation
and then you go down under control it's
always going
to be tempting to let your elbows flare
a couple more joey
it's always going to be tempting for
your elbows to come out on the way up
resist especially on the way down make
sure you're doing these right so they
hit your triceps and not much
else all right
the next mistake is to think that some
grips
or some bars or even dumbbells are
better or worse
on a sort of blanket level than some
others people say
what grip do you recommend for skull
crushers i only have really one answer
one in which you feel your triceps to be
really well stimulated
tons of tension tons of burn tons of
pump and
tons of disruption after the session and
one in which
your shoulders and elbows and so on and
so forth don't accrue a lot of damage
and don't hurt a ton
so basically a very comfortable grip or
hand position
or even different kind of bar because
you can use an ez bar you can use a
straight bar you can use dumbbells
in one that really allows you to work
your triceps while keeping
your pecs and front delts and everything
else a little bit more out of the
movement
it's super different for everyone joey
could be the guy
that does wide grip skull crushers joey
go ahead and grab with a slight wide
grip and like pretend
it's something that works for you so he
could do skull crushers with a wide grip
and apparently like he's you know he's
doing them and i asked him hey does that
feel
 super weird on your shoulders or
elbows and he feels no he says no it
feels great
and but the triceps feel amazing and
they're getting a really great pump
really great attention
i can't dog them for that or try a super
close grip version joey real quick you
can be one of these guys that does a
close
grip and all of a sudden you feel a
great
stimulus in your triceps and your joints
feel good that's not going to be the
same for everyone he could replace those
with dumbbells or an easy bar here's
another cool trick
some people feel better with their thumb
looped with the bar
and some people with a false grip and
there's no problem doing one or the
other
if i loop my my elbows fry out for
no reason they just start hurting i have
no idea why
but honestly don't give a because
for me when i do the suicide grip or the
thumbless grip
everything feels 100 fine it's really up
to you
to find out what works best for you
there's no dogma here
there's no optimal grip for skull
crushers it's what stimulates your
muscles the best while expending the
least amount of fatigue and involvement
of other muscles
a quick tip and possibly a mistake if
you're doing the wrong thing here
is where to initiate the movement for
some folks
if they initiate at the elbows elbows
sort of break first
it feels really good for them really
great mind muscle connection for the
tricep no elbow pain no shoulder pain
for other folks if they do that they're
in hideous pain
and for them it's better to start moving
back first and then break at the elbows
there's no correct answer here that i
know of you just have to experiment and
figure out what you're doing
what i would say is don't just blind the
skull crush get elbow pain and not know
which one
because if you come up to me on the
street randomly you say hey you know
skull crushers hurt my elbows what
should i do
i'll ask you where do you initiate the
movement and if you have no idea what
that means you've never tried it you
won't be able to help yourself a ton so
joey show us real quick
here's how we initiate movement at the
elbow so if joey wants an issue moving
the elbow he's going to go forward with
his elbows towards his tummy
and then his shoulders flex and then he
goes all the way down
just like that alternatively he could
still touch his nose
but push his shoulders back first and
then break up the elbows and then touch
his nose
same similar very very similar looking
movement
but the initiation really does matter go
ahead and rack
similar idea almost identical idea with
squats
some people will squat by pushing their
hips back first and then bending their
knees
some people have no problem keeping
their hips locked and bending the knees
down
and a lot of folks it's a simultaneous
movement that really
both are going at the same time some
people
will really prefer one versus another
and there's honestly no super correct
answer as far as hypertrophy training is
concerned
so for these skull crushers play around
with bending first at the elbows
or first at the shoulders or even a bit
between
figure out which one works best for you
not just from a mind muscle connection
perspective but also from
how well your shoulders and elbows are
taking in perspective and for a lot of
folks
literally me included once i started
breaking at the elbows first and then
bending
i rediscovered that skull crushers were
an awesome exercise for me
after a decade of not doing them because
i thought they had to hurt my elbows
because i was always breaking backwards
give it a shot see how you feel
last tip and mistake for skull crushers
is going too heavy or too light
as long as you're getting a great burn
in your triceps as long as your pec and
shoulder stability isn't what's
sort of making you give out there's
really no such thing as too high of reps
anywhere between sets of 10 and all the
way up to sets of 30 is totally fine
i would save 20 to 30 reps for cable
stuff because i feel like it works
better and you can actually isolate the
muscle more
i think skull crushers for sets of much
over 20 reps
you you start to get more stabilizer
fatigue than tricep fatigue itself
sometimes the forearms start to cramp up
and give out so on and so forth
so ideally i think for most people skull
crushers
are best done in the 10 to 20 rep range
what about the 5 to 10 rep range when
you think about it
fundamentally it's an isolation movement
the five to ten rep range for isolation
is
tough right it can honestly lead to some
elbow pain some shoulder pain
technique can start to break down
because in the five to 10 rep rings
you're so focused on pushing the weight
which
should be that the technique might not
go out the window but
become less of a priority and all of a
sudden someone's like hey how was that
set for your triceps and you're like i
don't know i was just kind of trying to
press the weight right that's not really
what you want
but there's a hidden gem in there when
you say i was just trying to press the
weight
we do tons of presses in our chest
training and you can do close grip bench
and that stuff works great in the 5 to
10 rep range so remember
we have a ton of other exercises to use
tricep every pushing movement uses your
triceps
and if you do close grip benches for
example or incline close grip benches
or even just regular benches a lot of
that overhead presses are great
sets of five to ten are awesome on those
and they
do absolutely require your triceps to
contract super hard getting an excellent
heavy stimulus
so if you're doing heavy pressing
especially with closer grips as part of
your tricep and chest training
and even your shoulder training don't
worry about having to go heavy on skull
crushers
the skull crusher is almost then sort of
relegated to the higher rep work
for which they are more ideal so my
personal advice is
for sure anywhere between 5 and 30 rep
sets are totally fine
but your elbows especially might not
like sets of 5 to 10 and skull crushers
and your mind muscle connection might
not be that great
sets of 20 to 30 you may just generally
fatigue or other muscles like your
forearms might get in the way
your triceps won't be a limiting factor
anymore so i would say sets of 10 to 20
are probably best for movement like
skull crushers
but don't worry your heavy work will
still be there for your triceps coming
in from heavy close grip pressing
at a variety of angles including
shoulder pressing and your light work
probably best reserved for things like
cable extensions overhead cable
extensions rope push downs
so on and so forth folks that's it for
skull crushers
no dogma like i always say use whichever
tips you find useful for yourself
always be mindful of how much fatigue
you're taking how much joint
pain how much systemic fatigue you feel
adjust your execution to that
always be mindful of stimulus are you
feeling the tension where you're
supposed
to are you feeling the burn for higher
ups where you're supposed to are you
getting a pump in the target muscle or
somewhere else
and do you feel disrupted in the target
muscle after a session does it feel weak
does it feel shaky
does it potentially get a little bit
sore if all those things are good
then you're probably doing the right
technique right
if you have questions shoot them into
the comments below and
if you have answers if you want to help
your fellow youtuber shoot the answers
in the comments below
get a good discussion going and lastly
if you have some exercises we haven't
done yet
you should scroll back through some of
our earlier uh
our videos in the series and you'll see
that we've done a whole bunch of
exercises so far
but if we haven't gotten an exercise you
really want to see
maybe we will throw some suggestions in
the comments
we'll try to do a video eventually about
every single exercise we do in the
comments
unless it's a really stupid exercise
then you're a stupid person stop
commenting
close your computer folks see you next
time
