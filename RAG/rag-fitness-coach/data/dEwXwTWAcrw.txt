hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization i mean really
what else would i be here for
today's topic video is one that i think
a lot of you folks will enjoy and will
be able to send
over to a bunch of your friends asking
the same question what is better
the upper lower split the push-pull leg
split
or the full body split all right and
more particularly we're going to be
comparing these three very popular
splits for hypertrophy not for strength
that'll be another time and talk about
them in a cost-benefit discussion
because as we'll learn
there's not one better than the other
but there are better than the other for
distinct situations
and we're not just going to end this
video with it depends we'll tell you why
and how it depends
you're probably sick and tired of people
just answering it depends
on what let's find out so first we're
going to define the splits
actually what they mean to make sure
we're all on the same page then we're
going to talk about the upsides and
downsides of
the upper lower split the push-pull leg
split and the full body split
and then we're going to talk about how
you might choose between those splits
and how other folks that maybe you're
coaching or helping or chatting with
might also choose
to pick one of those splits that works
best for them and as always there's no
dogma here we don't have a side
we don't have a dog in the fight as a
matter of fact dog fighting is quite
cruel and we're against it all together
uh just suggestions so here we go
first of all let's define the splits
okay
as a matter of fact let's talk about
where the split actually is
fundamentally a good training split just
does really two things
it trains you often enough that you get
good gains because if you train like
once every two weeks
all the gains rise and they fall nothing
happens and it doesn't train you so
often
that you don't recover and heal between
sessions so you could say i'm gonna
train
18 times a week for the same muscle and
you'll just be
like an overcooked hot dog and nothing
will happen you'll be in a lot of pain
and probably get weaker
or you'll say you know i'm gonna train
once every two weeks and it's gonna be
amazing
but neither one of those works so
anything between those two extremes is
probably good
and training a single muscle group
anywhere between one time a week
works not the best two times a week
much better and then two to six times a
week is a lot of trade-offs in there but
both of those work really well
so fundamentally you can make your own
split from scratch
just making sure to train every single
muscle uh you know
two to six times a week on average and
that's totally cool
that works right but if you don't have a
ton of experience if you're just getting
started or if you just don't want to
overthink stuff
miss some details uh you can just start
with a simple pre-built split because it
can be a huge pain in the ass to build
your own split
and then eventually once you start on a
split you get a ton of biofeedback
you know how often it you know have to
train to recover a certain amount you
know how much volumes you do
you start to see some asymmetries like
oh my legs are getting hit well my
body's not getting
hit well and then you have a ton of
baseline information
to modify from right it works like this
in like tons of arenas in life
just start with something basic and then
eventually you can get complicated
it's kind of weird when people start
with a complicated lyric i want to have
the perfect split up front well you
don't even have enough ecological
information
to do that so just start with a simple
one and then get complex if you want
later is totally totally cool now
for the simple splits we can start with
the very basic ones you can just jump
right into
there are three super super common ones
and
they are the upper lower split
the push legs pull split and push pull
legs doesn't really matter how you
arrange them a ton
and the full body split so let's just
define these super super quick
the upper lower split trains upper body
on one day
and lower body on another day and then
it repeats that structure upper lower
upper lower upper lower
right and it can be done
technically two times a week although
veggies that's just one muscle group
once a week that's not probably not good
enough
so usually it's done four times a week
or six times a week so you go upper
lower upper lower or you go upper lower
upper lower upper lower all right
either one works and you can make the
split a little
bit more complicated by choosing some
different exercises day to day today so
for example
you train upper body twice a week maybe
one day
when you treating your back you do a lot
of vertical pulling
very little horizontal pulling and
another day you do
a lot of horizontal pulling and very
little vertical pulling that can be a
really cool thing
and also you can re-prioritize and
de-prioritize various muscles so for
example
if you have three pushing days one of
them
can be for rowing and lower chest
mostly and then a little bit of arms and
shoulders another one of them
can be for lots of vertical pulling and
incline and overhead work
for pushing and then still another one
can have the chest and back on the back
burner at the end but at the front end
is tons of arms and shoulders so you end
up
technically training upper body all of
it uh every single one of those three
uh upper body days but there's a little
bit of different
different emphasis every single time
which can allow you to balance a bunch
of muscle groups
all the time so that works super well
super basic there and then of course
on the upper lower on the lower days you
just do everything in your lower body so
your legs
there's a question every now and again
where do i put abs on that fundamentally
it doesn't really matter wherever they
fit more conveniently and don't mess up
that work
if you train abs at all which would be
another video we do at some point
next push legs pull it can be push pull
legs
doesn't much matter what you really just
don't want is your back workout tiring
out
your back so much that if you do pull
and then legs after
sometimes what ends up happening is your
back becomes a limiting factor in your
leg training
and that's no good rarely do you train
your legs so hard that they're limiting
factor in your back training afterwards
so by a small margin in many cases push
legs pull probably just a little bit
better than push pull legs but either
one of them is totally fine right
so what this does is it trains push one
day which is chest triceps front belts
and another day it trains lower body
which is same as lower uh for the upper
lower
and then another day it trains back
biceps rear delts
and often side delts on that day as well
but you can put side delts on
the push day no problem that's really
just sort of dealer's choice kind of
scenario
the thing about pushable legs and this
is when we get to oh sorry push likes
pull whatever
when we get to the specifics here it
really can only be done six times a week
okay you can take like you can do push
legs pull rest
push legs pull rest or rest rest or
something if you do that
you get an asynchronous weekly structure
so that every monday
looks different for an entire messa
cycle that tends to be weird we'll cover
that sometime in another video
as to the benefits of synchronous
asynchronous splits but uh
you know for the time being we're just
gonna synchronous split which means
push legs pull push legs pull rest
and then repeat so that it's seven days
long and lastly there's the full body
split it technically could be not split
to train
full body um basically every time you
come into the gym you train every single
muscle that you want to prioritize that
you want to grow and or maintain
right which means a lot of times you are
training your whole body every single
time now
there's an advanced modification to this
split we'll cover
more in depth later which is every time
you come to the gym you only train the
muscles
that are healed and ready to go you
don't necessarily train every single
muscle every single time so for example
if you train six days a week maybe your
biceps heal
almost every single day so you train
biceps five times a week but maybe your
hamstrings just because they tend to
heal a little bit slower
maybe you train them just twice or three
times during that time but you
essentially
decide when you're training uh you know
based on when muscles are healed and of
course you can pre-plan when you train
muscles and sort of auto-regulate from
there
but at the end of the day to call it
full body is just to say that
you're not splitting anything up into
any kind of groups
that have anything to do with each other
physically in the body upper versus
lower it's whatever heals gets trained
that is what uh jeff nippard and eric
helms
have been sort of touting lately and it
has a ton of advantages going for it
so we'll cover that a little bit later
and the full body split however you
slice it can be done
two to six times per week anywhere from
two times a week
three four five six so all right
let's get into the upsides and downsides
of the upper lower split
all right first upsides it
is brutally simple okay if somebody
needs a split
and they're just not a complicated
person or it's their first time working
out or so on and so forth
the upper lower split is just so to the
point
right and it's effective so it works for
a long time for folks that just don't
want to complicate
their training experience in addition to
that another benefit
is that it lets you have a great session
for the upper body
without what i would call like fatigue
poisoning from legs
right you throw legs into any other
session
and it toasts you for the rest of that
session and if you do legs at the end of
a session
you just need so much central drive to
train legs properly
that man they kind of just fuck the rest
of the session up
to some extent so the good news about
upper lowers it leaves legs the hell off
to their own so that day sucks and then
the upper day you have a little bit more
juice in the tank to train the rest of
the upper body lastly the benefit of the
upper lower split
is it can scale from four times a week
to six times a week so you can do upper
lower upper lower or upper lower upper
so the cool thing about this is that
someone who starts with
or maybe is as a very uh sort of middle
beginner
we'll talk about later the beginner
should probably start with whole body
but once they've graduated
to a four time a week upper lower split
they may like really catch some momentum
with it really like it and then they
might come to you and say hey listen
like
i'm ready to train more but i really
like this split
that's a super easy transition from just
four times a week to six times a week
you give them two more days but it's the
same structure they're already used to
that structure used to analyzing
soreness
these two constructing sessions super
super awesome now
this split like all the others comes
with its downsides as well
first of all not all upper body muscles
heal as fast as each other if you're
training them with due diligence
yeah you mess your pecs up it's going to
be like
you know two days three days from the
heel to go ready again if you go nice
and hard
you know side delts man you can probably
train them
at least every other day if not more
often biceps a lot of time don't get
that messed up
rear delts who knows right and then so
some muscles
in the upper body there's such a huge
variance especially if you start getting
into training like traps
and forms which you can train pretty
much every day it's kind of one of these
like well it's upper day
and i'm noticing my biceps aren't
growing as much from this split
but my chest and back are growing real
well and it's kind of like yeah right
but your biceps could just take so much
more frequency which you're not giving
them and
arbitrarily you know if you do move to
let's say
uh uh six times a week upper lower below
that might be like
pushing uh how hard you can train your
back and chest you might have to
contract those are officially just to
fit that
in so at the end of the day you know
yeah because you're essentially
artificially cramming in upper body as
one unit
there's nowhere in physiology that says
i should all heal at the same time so
you will have to all
sort of regulate how hard you train each
muscle necessarily training
the muscles that heal faster much harder
precession
maybe a bit harder than optimal and
necessarily potentially
uh scaling back on muscles that take a
little bit of a longer time to heal so a
bit of a downside there
next downside your legs and your upper
body might not heal the same rate either
okay your legs might heal enough for you
know two sessions a week at most
but with upper lower six times you could
be trying to train them
three times a week and that might just
be overkill but for your upper body
that's like super golden
right so there's no guarantee there
again
it's a real rigid structure so it has
those limitations that arise
right it's like if you give up
a sample of a hundred people the same
sized meal
because some people are just gonna be
like that's not enough food some people
are gonna be like oh this is great
and some people are gonna be like this
is overkill right if only you could give
people different size meals just the
same way if only didn't have to cram all
the muscle groups together in these sort
of arbitrary days to some extent
right and last problem that i foresee
and i'm sure there are others but these
are the main ones
is that doing all of your upper body
work in one session is
a lot especially for bigger and stronger
folks
like if you train quads hams and calves
it's hard but like with like
8 to 12 total sets for all of those
muscles per session
you can get a lot done the thing is
upper bodies a ton of muscles
you got the back you got the chest you
got the delts you got the triceps the
biceps yeah
compound pushing and pulling movements
can take care of a lot of those at the
same time
but not with due diligence you have to
do some isolations and it turns out like
if you're really trying to grow your
upper body doing the whole upper body in
one session
oh man it can be a lot which is where
splits that
more finely split things can start to
become a little bit better of an idea
for some folks which brings us to push
likes pull
up sides and downsides up sides you can
really hammer the upper body
because you split it into two sessions
and essentially four sessions a week
which is really awesome remember with
the upper lower split
the the most you can get upper body in
total sessions
is three times a week because it's upper
lower upper lower lower right here
with just the regular push legs pull
still six times a week total
you have four opportunities to hammer
your upper body
which is awesome like it's just more
time spent
being able to hammer that away and
notice the legs are now only being
hammered
twice a week which is kind of a little
bit more
in line with how fast they heal anyway
versus the upper body so that's a real
good
thing it's kind of like if you do up or
lower long enough you notice like
really holding back on my legs to make
sure their heel healed
but like uh i could train upper body
more than this
and then push like pull comes along and
it's like oh wow this is exactly what i
was saying right so
that is is definitely a thing and you
know if
another sort of downside to just doing
uh all upper body
is you end up hopping from one machine
to another and
you know you have to use like six
machines or seven machines in the same
session
sometimes there's an old dude there like
dying in the machine for five minutes
and you're like
god damn it like if only i could just
condense my train a little bit
push like pull definitely allows you to
do that
it is also another upside is it's a
great fit
from an organizational perspective of
muscles not interfering with each other
uh push doesn't really interfere with
any pulling muscles so you can be
fucked up in your pushing muscles and
your pull session can go
a-okay and you can be completely fucked
up in your upper body and your leg
training still goes okay so that's a
really awesome thing
so you can always train hard and while
you're training one thing hard the other
thing is resting
super super awesome now
a huge benefit here which is a little
bit nuanced
is that by only allowing you to train
every muscle group specifically not
upper versus lower
but push and pull and legs each one only
gets trained twice a week
and sort of by definition you have to
rest at least two days sometimes three
in order to hit the next one
what it can do is it can really prevent
people from going overboard on volume
and intensity and so on and so forth
which they can do in other splits and
we'll talk about that in a second so
sometimes you get really overzealous
people
they're like i wanna fucking smash my
chest and they smash at every workout
and if you tell them like you can train
chest up to six times a week
some of them are like great i'm just
gonna smash it six times a week and then
they end up getting weaker and over
trained and potentially injured and
nothing
you know best cases nothing really
happens worst cases they get hurt and
then you're like ah
you trained too much chest but if you're
condensed to two sessions of chest
you know like even if you overkill twice
a week that's still plenty of recovery
time and they're probably going to be
fine
so a lot of times the push legs pull
essentially like uh
contracts people who just want to go
psycho and train everything
into a limited range of volume
that keeps them sort of sane and keeps
them from not overdoing it because like
if you try to do 60 sets of chest a week
if you train chest every day you can
fucking do that no problem chance that's
just no problem every day right
no problem until you fall apart uh if
you're on push legs pull
60 sets of chest a week is 30 cents of
just chest in one workout
most people just won't do that and
they'll be so tired by the end of the
workout this junk volume anyway
bad news it's not doing anything to help
them grow good news it's not causing
much further muscle damage because
they're barely recruiting anything right
so this is kind of like a good way to
constrain people
that are just like sort of like
boogie-eyed about like ooh
i want to do all the training relax here
do this and then don't kill yourself
and it probably won't if you do this
right now
not without its downsides of course so
same problems as we saw
earlier not all pushing and pulling
muscles feel the same rate your back
uh probably doesn't heal the same rate
as your biceps and your your rear adults
your triceps may not hear the heel the
same rate as your chest front dots so on
and so forth so we still have problems
there
again uh legs and upper might not heal
the same rate either
but that really only applies to legs and
the smaller upper body musculature
because the upper body is trained sort
of twice as often
as legs this is a problem that only
affects the small musculature the
muscles
most of the ones in the upper body that
take a little while to heal this is a
perfect alignment so this is only a very
minor critique
definitely less of a critique than it
would be for the upper lower split
now two times a week frequency
for lags uh
and two times a week frequency for push
and pull respectively
means that smaller muscle groups that
recover faster
just aren't getting the due diligence
that they need that's a big downside
for example someone says hey look what
split are you doing you're like
push legs pulled uh okay how are your
biceps coming along they look pretty
good
my back's growing a lot more though and
then they go like how sword is your back
and when does it heal like dude i train
it it heals like two or three days later
right on times like the entire time i'm
either sore
i'm training it hard like wow sounds
really good sounds like it makes sense
like what about your biceps
well you know uh they're never really
sore i could train them a lot more often
and say well why don't you you're like
uh push legs pull bro
there's a structure but it's good it's
good to have a respect for structure
but that structure might not be doing
due diligence to the muscles that can
heal faster
and potentially would benefit from a
higher frequency or just arbitrarily
waiting around
for no good reason the last criticism
and this one
is why push legs pull us kind of the
meat and potatoes of folks transitioning
into more serious training
is that it doesn't scale it's only six
days a week
okay that's it unless you wanted to go
asynchronous and then it just gets crazy
which is also for advanced people so
because it can't scale and it's only six
times a week this is not something you
start people on
for sure you imagine like your aunt
marge is like oh i'd like to try
weight training and you're like push
legs pull marge
welcome to the fire and i want you to
watch 18 ronnie coleman videos
and die on the hack swatch she's like
sounds good sonny
you know i don't know why she talks like
that but in any case it's a big deal six
times a week is the only way it works so
you have to be fully committed
now full body upsides and downsides
big upsides one it really pumps up the
frequency potentially
of exposure of every single individual
muscle to stimulus
through the week which is amazing for
gains especially in the short term
because frequency
makes you grow like crazy to the extent
and for how long you survive
right so awesome no more problem of my
biceps don't get trained enough
gone if you design your program like
that
next the advanced version the jeff
nippert eric helms version
lets you train muscles exactly in
proportion to their healing time
so maybe jeff or or eric
will train hamstrings super hard with
hip hinges
uh one day of the week um less hard
with some isolation curls for their legs
another day and then still another day
hamstrings might receive like
sort of kind of just uh accessory volume
through some
deadlifting sumo deadlifting not exactly
targeting the hamstrings a little bit
maybe some lunging or something like
that
or maybe some strong man work or
something that hits the hams just a
little bit so it ends up being that
every single time the hams heal they can
be hit again instead of having to go ham
ham ham and overdoing it
or having to look okay heads ham's just
twice a week and like they could be
trained three and no one's putting it
because there's no restrictions on where
you can put stuff especially in the
advanced version
you can essentially say okay i'm going
to train chest four times a week because
that's how often it heals
back three times a week hamstrings twice
a week and then quads i'm going to do
one really hard session and then one
pretty easy session like one and a half
times a week nothing stopping if you're
doing that which is
really really awesome huge upside there
and then when someone
asks you hey why aren't you training xyz
muscle groups today you could literally
say
because it's not healed yet and then
when they go hey what are you training
today and you go
xyz they say why you go because these
are muscles that are healed
wow i mean you're really taking care of
all the bases there
another advantage it can break up hard
to train muscles like quads and hams in
different sessions if needed
this is a personal preference thing but
it's nonetheless worth repeating or
worth making sure we cover
some folks it's just a lot for them
to do something like a leg day
like and leg days suck and at some point
if you're doing justice to your quads
you're not doing justice to your hands
because whatever you train first limits
the second thing like
crazy right you do like six sets of leg
press and three sets of squats
whatever you call hamstrings after that
that might not be happening
or the degree of stimulus might be
really small so what you can do here
is you can do like quads with some upper
body stuff
next day hams are some upper body stuff
next day quads next day hams and so on
and so forth
so you never really have to do a crazy
psycho leg day and go nuts about it
right and you can even do
these individual muscle groups you can
because you can do them more frequently
you can break them up into volume that's
not super crazy
so similar idea but basically instead of
doing
like two quad sessions a week with tons
of sets in each session and just dying
by the end
you might be able to do four quad
sessions a week but just a little bit
less volume every single time the same
total volume over the week or very
similar sometimes even higher
but there's never like this element of
especially when you're dieting or
something like that hypochlorically to
lose fat
man you know you're staring down the
barrel of five sets of squats you're
like fine
you're staring down the barrel of ten
total sets of quads five squats five leg
presses at the same time like
holy crap the the last three sets here
might not be me doing anything it might
just be
me like trying not to die not exactly
the best workout in the world
last big upside is this
design the whole body scales all the way
from two times a week
to six times a week that's awesome
okay that is a very very flexible
program so
if you start as a beginner or two times
a week and you love this
full body training what you can do is
like when you're six months or 12 months
into training and everything's going
well and you're like i love this i'm
addicted to training a lot more
you go to three times a week not
changing the split basically at all
and then you go to four times and five
times and eventually six times no
problem
and that's when you start using the
advanced techniques of not necessarily
training everything every time but just
when it heals
and you're in the money right so really
really big upsides there
downsides here we go there are some
first of all
such a program especially in the higher
frequencies
can easily overdo volume fatigue and
injury especially to the joints
your quads might recover training hard
four times a week
your knees and your tendons
might not over the long term a lot of
people who have tried ultra high
frequency
report that their joints at some point
can't take it that's why we at rp
for the very advanced recommend
periodizing and cycling frequency
you start a block of training with a
relatively low frequency and as you get
used to training a little bit the next
block is slightly higher
the last block is a very high frequency
you know it's unsustainable
and then the block after is a
resensitization phase or active rest you
pull back everything heals
and you start on the low end again but
for a lot of folks doing this especially
folks that are too experienced they're
gonna look at it like six days a week
let's do it
quads five days of those and they end up
you know having hurt knees and sort of
don't know why
the reason is they've been doing 40 sets
of quads for the last six months
and also there's no healing time between
days for the joints muscles heal quickly
joints heal much less quickly and so do
tendons and other connective tissues
so even if per unit volume you're doing
fine
it's just maybe way too rapid which is
why a lot of folks who are really big
and really strong
tend to gravitate towards lower
frequency routines one or two times a
week training hard
because they're not into the
periodization cycling as much
and for them they've just realized that
lower frequency routines are more
sustainable for their joints
and because they're so big and strong
their joints are often a limiting factor
so it's really obvious to them what we
don't want you to do is start off as a
beginner
train everything six times a week fry
your joints and then have joint problems
for the next several years or maybe the
rest of your life if you go far enough
and be like ah crap i should have never
done that so this comes with a big
warning sign here for sure
now another downside you got to use all
the fucking machines in the gym on any
given day especially if you're trying to
do true whole body
everything every day which is fine right
you got to go all around the gym for
that shit
and that means it's a bit of a pain in
the ass you can't spend as much time in
any one area of the gym on any one
machine
and you know like it's great for a leg
day to come in and be like i need three
pieces of equipment and that's it
but if you need like 10 pieces of
equipment and you work at a busy gym or
you work out at a busy gym
oh my god you could spend like several
minutes here and there waiting you know
for soccer mom to finish doing her leg
extensions as she reads her phone
set of 50 or whatever 50 leg extension
rep set with 50 rar i'm sure you guys
have seen that before
and it's kind of like that i wish i
could just come in laser focus and leave
instead of having to train my entire
fucking body the whole time and wait on
everyone in the gym
very related you got to warm up a ton
because you don't just jump in
especially as you get strong you don't
just jump into a heavy exercise
you don't do all your pushing work and
then jump into pulling right hard and
heavy
you got to warm up for pushing do the
pushing and within each pushing exercise
you got to warm up a little bit for each
different exercise
in addition to that you got to warm up
after do you're done to do pulling
and then you got to rewarm your legs a
little bit to do any leg workout
so you end up the the ratio of warming
up to working sets
not that great for whole body training
way worse than it is for concentrated
training
that focuses on just a few muscle groups
at a time not a huge downside but
definitely a concern especially for
people
who don't have a ton of time for example
now
it can absolutely make
something like quad training easier
psychologically by spreading it out more
for some people for other people
it has the opposite effect of
essentially like pulling a band-aid off
really slow
myself for one example so eric helms is
of the opinion for himself
that he prefers to spread out leg
training to multiple sessions per day
for example quads
three quad sessions or four quad
sessions each one with just a few sets
works great for him
not a critique a ton of you will fall
into that category do it
some of the rest of you will fall into a
category i personally experience
which is once i'm warmed up and training
quads heavy
i'm just fucking in and i don't want to
have to rewarm up and train them heavy
two days later
because i'll be in fucking pain and the
whole warming up process is fucking
annoying
and it's tons of like it's just legs is
a thing it's a thing psychologically
once i'm in the groove i'm in and i'm
down
it's kind of like you know if you
if you have a favorite restaurant that's
like 50 minutes away like 5-0 of a drive
like when you go there you're gonna
fucking eat well you're not gonna go
there
like and say oh like i'll just have this
egg roll cause god come back tomorrow
like you know really you're gonna drive
50 minutes again
now for some people who maybe have
someone to go with and love the drive
that's a totally cool thing and they
don't want to stuff themselves other
benefits but for folks like me
like if i'm going out of my way and once
i'm warmed up
everything's going great i'm going to
want to warm up as few times a week as i
have to
so for me training quad something like
twice a week is much better than
training it more frequently so that's a
potential downside
you can get caught into if you're not
aware of these things
like you could be training quads four or
five times a week just like god damn it
like
it's a fourth fucking quad workout this
week i wish you could just do three
cause like you might experience the
sensation at the end of a quad workout
four-time movie quad workout you might
be like man i could just
i can keep going but like my log book
says i have to stop because i got to be
recovered
to be ready a day from now whereas if
you restructure your plan to be
recovered two days from now
you can keep riding that momentum once
you're warmed up and do a good job
personal preference but buyer beware
lastly it can be confusing as shit
right especially for the advanced
version people who are unaccustomed to
training can be like which muscles do i
train at which days
there's an endless field of question
just
go youtube and go to either jeff
nifford's channel or eric helms uh stuff
where wherever eric has been on a couple
of channels talking about
is actually a bit believe he's been on
jeff nippers talking about the whole
body training
and read some of the comments and
because these guys are amazing they're
brilliant and they explain things super
super well it doesn't matter how well
you explain them a ton of people be like
all right
so when do i train my hamstrings is it
like every day is it every other day i
have to train every day
and like eric is doing this on you know
behind the scenes to people
of like it's not that fucking hard you
train muscles when they're healed
but in the real world for beginners and
folks just not used to training or
conceptualizing it
it's like okay it's whole body you're
like huh but it's that really whole body
because if your muscles not recover you
don't have to train it they're like uh
not registering right so for folks like
imagine training your mom or your dad
you're not going to be like all right
well integration we want the curse to
rise and fall and you're going to train
things when they're healed and like what
the fuck
they just be like hey look whole body
means every muscle
go and then two days later go again or
upper lower upper lower upper lower
that's hard to fuck up
right so it's a little bit confusing it
can be complicated it's not for everyone
especially the advanced version which is
one of the reasons why it's advanced
so last thing we're going to cover
is how might you choose
what you are going to do for your split
or
related what you would advise other
folks to do because i'm sure lots of you
are experts yourself and you get asked
all the time like hey what do i do for
my workout you're like
damn it pay me for the shit so here's
the deal
you don't have to do it this way just a
suggestion
fresh new beginners i don't mean like
zero to three years of training as we
usually identify at rp
i mean like zero to three weeks of
training
or zero to three months whole body
full body every muscle that you wanna
train you trade it mostly through
compound basic conclusion not a ton of
isolations
two to four times a week a lot of times
you start beginners two times a week if
they get addicted to another couple
months you raise them to three if they
want and then eventually they're going
to look like i need four i'm just gonna
strangle somebody and you go to four
sweet right now as they gain experience
or as you gain experience you can
consider an upper lower split for
simplicity
and if you're figuring out that you love
to train hard per session
and use more time to heal and you like
that structure
totally fine okay as you get
more experience we're like well into the
intermediate stage now
you might consider uh push legs pull
if you need more volume to grow specific
muscle groups
and more loading and more recovery time
like your leg workout is getting fucking
gnarly and you really just want to smash
your chest and smash your triceps and
smash your back
in individualized sessions where you get
a lot of focus on them that's when push
legs bull
starts to become a good idea once you've
been doing something like push legs pull
or a bit more of an advanced split for
some time
that thing we were talking about earlier
is going to pop up in your head like
my smaller muscle groups are not being
trained often enough our smaller muscle
groups are not being trained often
enough
that you can fix by essentially starting
to pepper in
more faster healing muscle training so
for example
on a pull day you can do biceps at the
end
after back and on a push day you could
do biceps at the end
after chest and triceps so you're
training biceps four times a week you
say okay
four times a week is a lot how many
recover from that well thing is because
you train biceps last every time
you know yeah they're like pretty
wrecked but nothing you can't recover
from like if you train them first every
single time maybe you'd have to do
three times a week but because you train
them last every time you don't have to
do that just as an example
you can train them more often all of a
sudden though you went from training
your biceps twice a week
to four times a week you can easily do
the same thing with rear delts side
delts
calves okay you can do calves on leg
days and you can also do them on push
days
that's four calves or calves on leg days
and on one of the push days you can go
three
so essentially you can start keeping
that core structure of push legs pull
and peppering in some of the muscle
groups with added sessions that tend to
heal faster
super small idea i did that for a really
long time worked great
now the most experienced and basically
that point number four there once you
have pushed likes pulling you pepper in
the muscle groups that recover faster
you essentially end up
with a helms nipper style uh full body
routine because someone can ask you and
i get this question on instagram all the
time
if you follow me on insta i post all of
my training there pretty much
i get this question all the time like
look at like when i did that session and
they're like what day is it i'm like
it's a thursday
like oh you fucking asshole i meant like
is it push or legs or pull and i'm like
well it's a little complicated it's
core pushing movements but with a little
bit more pulling because i need more
extra work because it recovers a little
faster
and some arm stuff and it's tough to
describe so uh eric helms and jeff
nipper did really really well
with the advanced whole body so
basically that push plugs eventually
becomes the advanced whole body
now here's the thing last little gem for
the most
and the most dedication to trying to
grow as much muscle as possible
you should start to consider multiple
daily sessions
okay to target all muscle groups with
due diligence so you train every single
muscle group almost
fresh at least a few times during the
week you train all of them at exactly
the frequency they need
that just simply takes more than six
sessions because you should always take
one day
of rest right you should never almost
never train seven days a week so one day
is rest that leaves us six days
at least six days but not necessarily
six sessions because we can do up to two
sessions a day
that leaves us potentially as many as 12
sessions which is something almost no
one can recover from for a long time
but people can recover from it sometimes
for a mesocycle so you might do a
motorcycle of eight sessions
a mess cycle of 10 sessions and a
message cycle of 12 sessions a week fuck
get me out of here throw me the rope and
then you take a active recovery phase or
maintenance phase four time a week
training or two times a week training
keel all the fatigue and go back into it
super swell idea
to get now here's the deal it's not for
anyone except for
super interested people in optimization
like folks are ready to dedicate their
shit
to growing muscle okay if you have any
notion in your head of like yeah but
like it's not convenient
fuck out get out right not for you and
but that's okay because that means you
have a life but for those rest of us
that don't have lives and we just want
muscle growth
this is the place to be and for tons of
details on him
go to the revive stronger youtube
channel and
we have an interview with myself jared
father and charlie young
on two times a day training how we
structured theory so on and so forth
you'll probably love that
and if you don't you know try to put a
little love in your life
you know what i mean go to music
festival hey hey hug somebody
wait still covet 19 when we're recording
this don't fucking hug anyone
you disease promoting asshole folks see
you next time
you
