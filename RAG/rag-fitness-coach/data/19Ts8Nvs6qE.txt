the back squat is probably the most
popular lower body exercise
it's sometimes even referred to as the
king of all exercises
could you get away with only back
squatting for the rest of your training
career
and experience close to or even maximal
leg hypertrophy
back squat here refers to the high bar
back squat but note much of this video
will apply to the low bar back squat
and the front squat as there are way
more similarities between these
movements than differences
we'll also be mentioning the effect of
different squat depths
and stance widths throughout the video
let's first figure out if the back squat
is enough for maximizing quadriceps
hypertrophy
a study by fonseca and colleagues gives
us an interesting insight
49 untrained men were split into five
groups
we won't mention the control group as
they did not train
the four groups trained twice per week
for 12 weeks
group 1 performed the back squat only
with around 8 reps per set
group 2 performed a variety of leg
exercises
the back squat and leg press from weeks
1 to 4 the back squat and deadlift from
weeks 5 to 8
and the back squat deadlift and lunge
from weeks 9 to 12.
all exercises were performed with around
8 reps per set
group 3 like group 1 performed the back
squat only
but they used a variety of rep ranges
throughout the 12 weeks
group 4 like group 2 perform the same
variety of leg
exercises but they used a variety of rep
ranges throughout the 12 weeks
i should mention that the back squat was
performed on a smith machine
and to only 90 degrees of knee flexion
this sounds terrible
but it probably isn't actually a big
deal in my free weights vs machine video
i explain why the smith machine back
squat can probably produce similar
growth to the back score
additionally research by kubo and
colleagues suggests 140 degree knee
flexion squats
so deep squats produce similar
quadriceps hypertrophy to 90 degree knee
flexion squats
returning to the study cross-sectional
area of the vastus lateralis vastus
medialis
rectus femoris and vastus intermedius
was measured before and after the 12
weeks for all groups
the groups that varied their exercises
to groups 2 and 4
experienced statistically significant
growth of all quadriceps heads
the groups that only squatted so groups
1 and 3
did not group 1 did not experience
statistically significant growth of the
vastus medialis and directors femoris
group 3 did not experience statistically
significant growth of the rectus femoris
therefore this study suggests that a
variety of leg
exercises is likely better for overall
quads hypertrophy
if you're not sold on this study because
of the smith machine
and 90 degrees of knee flexion the
already mentioned kubo and colleague
study
provide us with further valuable details
they had 17 untrained men
perform either back squats with 140
degrees of knee flexion
or back squats with 90 degrees of knee
flexion
both groups trained twice per week for
10 weeks
neither group experienced significant
growth of the rectus femoris
the rectus femoris is the main muscle of
the quadriceps that is poorly trained
with the squat
it crosses both the hip and knee joint
and is involved in knee extension and
hip flexion
during the squat the rectus femoris
actually remains at a fairly constant
length
throughout the movement and therefore
hardly contracts
as shown by fonseca and colleagues a
variety of leg
exercises can help also
exercises like the leg extension and
reverse nordic curl
have been documented to be quite good at
growing directors for morris
the hamstring muscles also cross the hip
joint and knee joint
although the short head of the biceps
femoris is an exception here
the hamstrings extend the hip but also
flex the knee
during the squat the hamstrings like the
rectus femoris
seem to remain at a fairly constant
length throughout the movement
and therefore hardly contract returning
to the kubo and colic study
they also measured hamstring growth
neither the group that squatted with 140
degrees of knee flexion
or the group that squatted with 90
degrees of knee flexion experienced
significant hamstring hypertrophy
another study by bloomquist and
colleagues
measured hamstring cross-sectional area
multiple regions of the muscle
they had one group squatting to 60
degrees of knee flexion
so very partial squats and another group
squatting to 120 degrees of knee flexion
which are around parallel squats overall
there was very minimal increases in
cross-sectional area in some regions
and actually a decrease in
cross-sectional area in other regions
therefore dedicated hamstring exercises
are very much necessary
in the kubo and colic study gluteus
maximus volume was also measured
they found that the group that squatted
with 90 degrees of knee flexion
experienced minimal gluteus maximus
hypertrophy
but the group that squatted with 140
degrees of knee flexion
experienced substantial gluteus maximus
hypertrophy
therefore with around shoulder width
stances deeper squats seem to be
important for growing the gluteus
maximus
if with a shoulder-width stance your
anatomy does not allow you to
comfortably squat deep
wider stance squats might be favorable
for gluteus maximus development
emg research has suggested wider squat
stances
induce relatively high gluteus maximus
electrical activity
so does this mean the squat can be
enough for glute hypertrophy
it's probably still a good idea to
involve other hip extension
exercises such as deadlift variations
or hip thrust variations these are
probably useful to target regions of the
glutes the squat may under stimulate
moreover the other regions of the glutes
we haven't discussed
so the gluteus medius and minimus are
heavily involved in hip abduction
to maximize hypertrophy of these muscles
hip abduction exercises
like a cable hip abduction is likely
necessary
returning yet again to the kubo and
colleague study a doctor volume was
measured too
the group that squatted with 90 degrees
of knee flexion experienced minimal
growth of this muscle group
whereas the group that squatted with 140
degrees of knee flexion
experienced significant growth of this
muscle group
the adductor magnus is likely
responsible for this
modeling research suggests that the dr
magnus plays a significant role in hip
extension during the squat
especially at deeper depths
however the squat alone is still
probably not enough for overall adductor
hypertrophy
much of the other muscles of the
adductors are primarily involved in hip
adduction and so performing something
like a cable hip
adduction is likely necessary to
significantly hypertrophy the overall
adductors
most already intuitively know that
squats aren't going to significantly
hypertrophy the calves
the calves consist of the gastrocnemius
and soleus
both these muscles are heavily involved
in plantar flexion
therefore standing and seated calf
raises are
exercises that will heavily recruit the
calves as
a note seated calf raises are going to
be particularly good for the soleus
while standing calf raises are
particularly good for the gastrocnemius
to conclude regardless of the squat
variation
it without doubt would be a great
exercise for growing a lot of your leg
muscles
but at the end of the day other leg
exercises are still necessary to
stimulate muscle groups that the squat
may under stimulate
or not target at all
