hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
our custom training templates
you go online to our schnazzy website
linked in the description and you design
yourself a training program exactly
tailored to your needs and desires
we have a video
linked right here for you
about how to go about the ordering
process and making sure you pick all the
right muscle groups and getting a
routine together that you really like
costs 100 bucks 99 bucks unless it's on
sale
and then
you basically have
12 to 18 weeks or more
of customizable training
i know it's a good deal all right i'll
pat myself on the back for that one but
here's the deal
we did that video and there was sort of
how to order the thing and you could go
on the website and preview a little
sample we're going to do you one better
once you get your program what is it
that you're getting what does it look
like and how do you actually run it some
of you folks might be like yeah i might
want to order this but what the hell is
that going to look like and how
customizable is it etc etc so here we go
let's say you went in
and you ordered a six day a week
training program
and you picked some muscle groups to
train
what do you get what does it look like
well you get a bunch of ancillary
documents i'm not going to give you two
of those boring as hell but you get an
faq of like 50 frequently asked
questions you get a how-to document
that's going to say everything i'm going
to say accept and text a little bit more
boring i'll try to jazz it up for you
but let's take a little grand tour of
what you actually receive as far as the
training document itself so
when you open up and i'm going to be
following here and you guys can follow
along um with me
you get this document
and it has essentially sort of two main
parts to it the first part is the
building your program part which is
colored uh sort of grayish and then just
to the right of it it's the during your
training part because this first you
build your program and specify all the
muscle groups and everything like that
and then there are things to do during
your training so that your program can
adapt to your needs and auto regulate
for you to make sure that your volumes
are exactly what you need to get
probably our best estimate of what your
best muscle growth will be so here's the
deal
the first thing you have to do and don't
worry all the steps tell you to do this
anyway
is to choose your exercise
now the leftmost column says exercise
focus and that's what shows you what the
exercise trained so in our example
first exercise on our first day of
training here let's say it's a monday
is for shoulders so what you would do is
you would pick your exercise in this
case we'll pick the second one which is
cross body lateral rays
what the hell is that even cable cross
body lateral arrays what is that well
don't you worry because the next column
over has an instructional video if you
click on it it goes straight to youtube
opens up a video of probably jared
feather demoing the exercise and
probably me to turn up your volume
blabbing about how to do the technique
it's super short it's not like a whole
huge video it's like 15 to 30 seconds
just shows a couple reps of how to do
the exercise so now you pick the
exercise you have an instructional video
built in already the next thing you want
to do is pick your estimated 10 rep max
here's the cool thing you don't need to
adjust for fatigue so for example if
you're going down to the last exercise
in this day which is extra trap work and
you pick some exercise let's say we
choose the oh
barbell shrug pretty straightforward you
don't have to say oh my 10 rm but am i
assuming it's the fourth exercise and
i'm already tired
the weight selection process where we
actually take your 10rm and pick your
working weights for you
that's already integrated that
completely so all you have to do is
choose your fresh 10 rep maxes
and here's the biggest point huge point
enormous point
gigantic point
you just have to take the most raw guess
just an estimate because in hypertrophy
training the range of loads
that can grow muscle is really large
anywhere from like your 5 rep max all
the way to your 30 rep max and even a
little higher so when we're asking for
your 10 rep max just don't be off by
like hundreds of pounds and you'll be
good so like if you're let's say doing
crossbody lateral raise and you think
your 10rm is like 25 pounds but it's
really 20 or it's really 30 that's no
big deal it won't affect anything
meaningful at all so just take a decent
guess at it and here's another thing
be conservative
this program is not designed at all in a
way that if you're a little bit uppity
with your max estimates you'll get
stronger and a lot of people think
that's true and i understand where
they're coming from but you're like okay
you're making this program you're like
all right cross body lateral raise i
know my 10 ram is basically 20 pounds
but and if i type in 25 i'll get even
stronger and bigger bs it just doesn't
work like that so if anything you want
to be able to hang on during this
program not risk injury too much not
elevate your fatigue too much not to let
your technique break down chasing wild
numbers your best bet is to choose a
10rm that you know like for sure fresh
after warm-up you could hit 10 reps
maybe 11 maybe 12
if you had a gun to your head so there's
no bonus points for choosing too high
and as a matter of fact there's only
downsides so be conservative don't worry
the program will work even better if
you're conservative than if you're not
so
estimated 10 ram same type in 20
for that exercise for a cable crossed by
the laterals typed in 20 and voila
if you look over into week one
exercise has the cable cost by the
lateral it has a number of sets for you
to do in this case is three and it has
your working weight which says 20.
unbelievable is it kilos or pounds
doesn't matter it's units so if you are
in the uk and you're really strong it's
20 kilos and if you're in the united
states or somewhere else that uses
pounds which includes
maybe just the united states you your 20
is now pounds right so you don't need
units for us it could be whatever you
want and then it has
and now we transitioned into the running
the document part so before we get into
this part
all you have to do in building your
program
is choose all of your exercises in the
exercise column the instructional videos
pop up automatically and then you have
your estimated 10 rms for all these that
you choose you type in in week one by
the way in later weeks if you do an
exercise and it's like a little too
heavy and your reps aren't what you want
them to be you can always go back and
change the turnaround decrease it again
you will not get weaker doing this you
will not gain less muscle it's just
going to give you better training if you
up or
increase your 10rm later or decrease it
it's totally fine no big deal
just be realistic so you can always
change these later but you basically
pick all your exercises pick your rm
values for the 10rms and then the
worksheet autocompletes itself
with all the stuff that you need
and then you have a completed ready to
go program
for when you want to train
now that's the build your own program
we're through with that
easy peasy
during your training you have a couple
of things to do
you already have the exercise you
already have the number of sets you
already have the weight
and you have a rep goal and the rep goal
says three slash fail what the fuck is
that it's very simple it just means
three from fail which means three rar
three reps in reserve so in week one of
this program you're going to do as many
reps as you can each set
and stop three shy of that number so if
20 for cross-body laterals
you could do
15 reps or something like that
then you stop at around 12. and you guys
have trained with r training before if
you haven't it's no big deal just stop
when it gets pretty hard that's three r
don't worry the program will handle
everything later you just go a little
further
okay you got the rep goal
now
step one in this and don't worry this is
all written here it says you have
everything else up until this it says
okay train with three from fail for all
of your sets you have three sets with 20
pounds
and then it says enter your reps
completed and do this for each exercise
so after you've warmed up and we have
warm-up videos just type in israel tell
warm-up and how to warm up and we have
all those videos to take care of that
and type that in youtube
after you've warmed up you get to do
your work sets all the reps that you get
for your work sets you write in so you
write them in as like let's say you get
12 reps your first set then 10 then
eight on the second and third you write
12 comma 10 comma 8.
that's for you to refer to later we'll
get to that so you have to have those
values for this sheet to work properly
then
after the exercise is complete you have
two things to fill out for every single
exercise you have to select and it's a
drop down menu it's either negative one
zero or one and in some cases just zero
or one
and you just have to fill out your
soreness rating and your pump rating and
if you ever confused about what the hell
that means step two and step three
describe soreness rating and pump rating
pretty well but basically
if you're still sore from last time in
that muscle group
it's a negative one that's what you
select
if you're recovered just in time for the
session it's zero so like basically
let's say it's chest
and it's thursday and you barely
recovered wednesday and thursday we're a
couple oh thank god i'm not sore then
it's a zero and if you got a bit sore
but healed way long ago or if you just
never really got sore last time you
trained so that you know you're coming
to cable cross laterals and your delts
never got sore
you rate the soreness rating
as a one right so it's negative one zero
one and depending on how you rate this
the program either keeps the number of
sets that you had
add sets or subtract sets so basically
if you're having trouble recovering the
program reduces the number of sets
you're doing because it's too many you
want to recover if you're recovering
just on time and everything's good the
program is left alone seems like it's
good
if you are just way way recovered you
could do more no problem and still
recover the program will add volume to
your program sorry
good god the program will add volume to
the program it really is true the
program will add volume to itself to a
future time in which you do like the
next week it'll add volume so for
example if in week one it just wasn't
enough stuff you barely got sore week
two will usually have more sets if you
rate honestly again if you try to rig
the system and be a bro about it be like
look dad i need more volume you're going
to get yourself into a place where
you're under or over recovered by a long
shot just trying to chase dragons you
want to be as honest as possible
the pump rating very similar
there's three options
the confusing part is that the first two
are both rated zero that is not a typo
your sheet isn't broken it's on purpose
okay so if your pump was out of this
world mega pump it's a zero megapumps
are good but that means we don't add any
more volume if your pump was pretty good
it's still a zero which won't add any
more volume to your plant
if your pump was hardly noticeable or
non-existent that's not great that
probably means the stimulus is
suboptimal that's a one and that will
raise your number of sets in future
weeks for that exercise or other
exercises and other points in the plan
now
if you fuss with these values and you're
doing the sheet within any one week that
you rate pump and soreness if you want
to see oh do my sets increase here's the
thing the autoregulatory logic is
actually a little bit more complicated
than it would seem
if you rate cross-body laterals for
example
as you know a one on soreness
does the next week give you four sets
instead of three that might not be the
case
soreness
actually judges the exercise that came
half a week before so for example if
monday you have bench press and thursday
you have incline and on thursday you
rate that your chest is still sore
what's going to happen is
next mondays bench press will reduce in
volume because that's what made you sore
and carried over into thursday
right but the pump if the bench press
got you pumped on monday but not pumped
enough and you rate it a one
then it will add sets to next week's
bench press because the pump rates
itself soreness rates the other exercise
half a week ago for that same muscle
group in addition to that some of the
programs specifically the five day ones
the soreness ratings are sometimes
deactivated because it would produce
really crazy results sometimes there's
so much time between two different
training sessions that if we said oh i'm
still not sore still not sore still not
sore you'd have like 15 sets of chest in
a monday and it would destroy you you
would still recover by the friday that
you try and chest again that would be
way too much volume some of those are
rated with pumps only does that sound
complicated great it doesn't fucking
matter because all you have to do is
rate the shit honestly and we've
engineered in such a way that everything
takes care of itself
can you get smart with it and rig it can
you say oh you know i disagree with the
ratings slightly but i know my shit and
i'm gonna either manually type in the
sets i'm gonna do totally cool if you
know what you're doing or rate it in
such a way that raises and lowers the
sets for me in a way that i want that's
totally cool we trust you guys you know
what you're doing
but if you have to ask yourself the
question like oh is this a good idea or
am i going to fuck myself up just rate
the shit honestly you'll be good to go
rate everything
do all the reps do all the sets and
eventually you'll have trained for weeks
and weeks your volume will be auto
regulated to the point that you're
getting awesome muscle growth the entire
time
and then that leads us to our last
feature which is the deload week week
number six in this program here's the
thing
if you get really messed up and you have
to deal it earlier just skip to the
d-load week if it's week four and you're
like i can't keep doing this i'm gonna
fall apart
skip to week six the d-load the d-load
is profoundly easy
that's by design if you if you want to
skip the d-load don't do it if you're
dying to skip the d-load don't do it if
you just can't wait to skip the d-load
don't do it do the d-load it's designed
to let you recover to set up a great
next phase of training so the deload is
on purpose i promise
now one last super important thing
when you're going week to week to week
and it has rep goals for you first two
weeks or three from fail
then the next two weeks or two from fail
and week five is one rep away from
failure which is really fucking close to
failure and like if you want you can go
all the way to failure no big deal
dealer's choice
how do you know
how many reps to get the sets are auto
programmed the weight is auto programmed
by the way you can edit the weight any
time you want it's all uh all whatever
you want to do
how do you know how hard to push
yourself because i got to rir or two
from fail it leaves a lot to the
imagination some days you feel great
some days you don't feel great here's my
biggest tip
because you're writing down all the rep
results
here's what i would do
sometimes again it's not broken it's on
purpose week to week to week you'll have
the same weight
what do you do then whatever reps you
got
in the earlier week in the next week my
recommendation to get really good
results is just to add a rep to every
set as your goal so let's say you hit 12
10 8 in week one in week two it's still
20 pounds
aim for 13 11 9 and if you have a fourth
set
whatever that is two from fail or three
from fail right and then maybe that's
like a seven or eight and the next week
if it's still 20 pounds
14 12 10
9 instead of eight right so you added
another one
if
the weight is the same add a rep
if the weight goes up just try to keep
the same reps now if you're really
feeling your swag you can add two reps
or you can add one rep and five pounds
at the same time or two and a half
pounds or ten pounds or whatever the
sheet adds for you
my best recommendation here is error on
the side of being a little bit
conservative
yes almost always add something if not
always
add a rep at least or wait at least just
a little bit of weight always add
something but at a minimal amount of
something the way you grow muscle isn't
like this viking charge into battle like
fuck it at five reps and fucking 50
pounds you don't make gains that are
meaningful in a week of bravery you make
small gains but just incremental small
adjustments upwards and if you keep
doing that weeks over weeks over weeks
and months over months eventually you're
gonna be jacked as fuck so all you have
to do is challenge yourself a little bit
each time and you're golden so that's
how you choose your reps you set all of
your baseline reps in the first week and
then you either add a rep or a bit of
weight or maybe a small combination of
both hello check this out after five
working weeks of adding reps and weight
holy shit
probably your volume is going to go up
too if you're recovering it's going to
be an unbelievable amount of work
almost or if not the last thing i'll
talk about today
if your workouts are taking a long time
because there's so many sets and you're
like look i can work out for an hour and
a half after that i'm just not
interested in spending that much time at
the gym what do i do just manually
change the number of sets to contract
the workout so that you don't have to be
in the gym for forever but like oh fuck
it says six sets of barbell shrugs today
i get the fuck out of here four sets is
totally cool
volume is important but as long as
you're hitting it hard in every set with
a really good technique and adding a
little bit of weight and or reps every
time volume's not that important so if
you have life commitments time
commitments you got a baby at home and a
wife hopefully
then uh you don't have to go crazy in
the volume but if you're in here for max
gains
you do whatever volume it tells you to
do and you'll get really really good
results
do all that stuff increase by a little
bit do the ratings get to the deload
deload if your performance ever stalls
out and then falls i would just start
deloading right then
if that happens you may have been too
aggressive in the earlier weeks so the
next time you do this plan be a little
less aggressive and you may make it all
the way through the five weeks of
accumulation take a week of deload and
then you'll be good to go
notice your plan came with only one
mesocycle of training
what the fuck the male physique female
physique templars came with like three
here's the cool thing
when you get the shit don't delete the
email
save it right save a blank copy of this
so that after you finish the first six
weeks you can go to the blank copy save
as for the document open it up
i would keep most of the same exercises
if they're going really well for you if
you're getting a really good stimulus to
fatigue ratio getting good pumps good
tension good soreness your joints feel
great the exercise is progressing and
weight and reps i would just leave the
fuck alone if just for shits and giggles
you want to vary totally cool or if the
exercise is like skull crushers are
bothering my elbows i think i'm going to
change to push downs totally fine as
well
change all the exercises you need don't
change the ones that you don't give
another shot at a realistic 10rm
estimate if it's the same exercise as
last time bump the 10 around estimate by
i don't know
5 to 15 pounds in most cases sometimes
two and a half pounds again conservative
is best you'll know when you're much
stronger and you can add more weight and
then you have another six weeks of ultra
productive training
when do you need to buy a new one of
these and
get me another 99
i get like five bucks of that or some
shit and because you know i need
lamborghinis and expensive rims to put
onto them so when is it time for you to
give me lamborghini money by buying
another template or another program well
the answer truthfully i hope they're
getting trouble with everyone else at rp
for saying this
you could buy one of these shits and if
it's a number of days that you really
like to train and the muscle groups that
you picked are the ones that you really
still want to prioritize just the same
way
you can kind of use the same template
indefinitely like you can fucking go
months and years with the same shit
in most cases
what we want to tell you is this
again it's me shooting myself in my own
financial foot no fuck i'm telling you
this actually do is our number one goal
at our piece to be completely fucking
honest with you guys we're not here to
fucking jack you up for a bit of money
now you know we want long-term you know
benefits for everyone because everyone
wins like that so here's the reality
almost every template unless you really
want to change the number of days you're
training or the muscle priority almost
every temple should be run for at least
two mesocycles in a row that six weeks
long so 12 weeks and probably more like
two to three so when you're paying 100
bucks or whatever you get 12 to 18 weeks
minimum of training and it can be even
more if you like the program if you like
the number of days if you like your
muscle group split if you don't
save that program because you could
always come back to it
and just get another program pay another
100 bucks pick everything very carefully
last video will cover that lydia video
is linked and then you've got another
program and now you have two really good
programs and you can alternate them we
are not interested in just scamming you
guys for money like hey buy this program
and then you know whatever buy one every
month don't fucking do that we have tons
of customers we make plenty of money we
want you guys to get fucking jacked
because that's why you pay us money so
if you buy this program and you really
like it you want to keep using it hey
use it for a long time when you need
another one come back we'll hook you up
it'll be super cheap it'll be super
awesome
and i think that's about it if you guys
have any questions i'll be scanning the
comments i'll try to answer as many
questions as possible if you have any
further questions once you buy your plan
et cetera on the rp website we have a
customer service chat box just ask in
there they'll try to help you as much as
possible and hey listen
go out there and get as much muscle as
you can
because isn't that what life is about
maybe anyway see you next time
