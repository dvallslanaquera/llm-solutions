hey folks
dr mike israetel here for renaissance
periodization
healthy eating made simple video number
five supplements
and hydration let's get right into it
our last four videos in those videos we
learned some
really really cool useful stuff about
how to make a healthy eating plan
we know how to choose healthy foods we
know how to make balanced meals we know
how to count
macros awesome and we know how to stick
to a pretty stable meal schedule and
cook meals that we really like to eat
reliably and with very little effort
great
next we are going to learn how to take
that baseline awesome diet we have
and manipulate it in order to
potentially lose fat or gain a little
bit of muscle to optimize our health
even further
but before that we have a little bit of
housekeeping to do
specifically answering the questions of
should we be taking any supplements
and or should our hydration be somehow
regulated because these are super common
questions
anytime you talk about health and
nutrition let's get them
kicked off and i mean kicked because
they're not going to take that long
here's the thing about health
supplements the most basic truth is that
nobody really
needs the vast majority of cases outside
of the medical literature
people just don't need health
supplements now you can
take some health supplements to enhance
your health potentially a little bit and
it almost certainly won't hurt your
health
but there's no promise that'll make it
better just to sort of round out your
intake now
following the advice of a previous four
videos and eating a diversity of
different kinds of foods almost
always checks these boxes but we might
be able to do just a little bit better
and it certainly won't hurt
if we can have the following three
classes of supplement and they're super
simple supplement type number one
multivitamin multimineral just go get it
at walmart or sam's club or something
like that
easiest thing in the world have one a
day rounds out your intake number two
vitamin d supplements some evidence to
show that that may be beneficial
especially for people in northern
latitudes that don't get as much sun as
they perhaps would want
and they're if you could buy them in
gummies the gummies are delicious and
it's really easy to have two gummies a
day
no big deal and then potentially fish
oil now fish oil has
recently run into some research
controversy where it's not clear used to
look like a really great supplement
everyone should be taking
nowadays it might not modulate
cardiovascular disease risk like we
thought
but it almost certainly won't hurt you
and it might help you a little bit
none of these supplements if that's your
answer you don't take
is a fine answer no problem you don't
have to take these supplements so don't
go to the store and run get them but if
you want to
choose to be on the really super super
meticulous side that's totally cool
there are very few if any other
supplements that
have not been mentioned that you should
be taking for your health because
fundamentally as this first point on the
slide says
the basic truth is you probably don't
need any supplements at all in most
cases
in some cases you will need particular
supplements for various cycles of life
pregnancy breastfeeding elderly etc
that's a clinical setting that's to be
determined with you and your doctor or
your clinical nutritionist
that's a special case but for most folks
in most circumstances yeah these three
supplements are totally cool to take and
you can totally take them
and or not at all it's totally fine that
brings us to the last point here
hydration the human body is incredibly
incredibly well designed
to keep you hydrated enough to keep you
healthy now that doesn't mean that it
hydrates you well enough to maximize
your athletic performance
if this lecture was tailored to
hydration athletic performance it could
be an hour long about super meticulous
ways to make sure hydrated
pre during post so on and so forth but
for general health
hydration is something that happens
pretty much automatically you can ensure
that this process never gets even a
little bit off the rails
by drinking a glass or a can or a cup of
just some kind of calorie-free beverage
with pretty much every meal
and if you find yourself thirsty at
various points during the day just drink
more of whatever calorie-free stuff
water is totally fine soda water is
totally fine
diet coke and stuff is totally fine
that's all super good to go super super
healthy
if you want an indicator if you're
really concerned about your hydration
you think i'm chronically under drinking
just look at the volume of your urine
and its color if you're peeing plenty
relatively often and your urine is off
yellow or even regular yellow
and it definitely fits clear you're
doing just fine a hydration
no big deal look if your pee is brown or
brownish
and you pee twice a day yeah you can
probably stand to be more hydrated
regularly and then make it a point
to drink with your meals i will say an
easy way to do this is just to have a
cup or glass or something like that
with every single meal because a lot of
people they eat just a regular food and
they don't drink and they just don't
make it a habit and then they run into
like oh my god i'm getting super thirsty
they have to ride out of their work and
go get
you know thing of mountain dew or
something like that you can preempt a
lot of stuff
just by developing a habit of drinking a
nice tall glass
of whatever calorie beverage can be
water can be anything else
with your meals and then you're super
super well taken care of now
yeah that's it for supplements and
hydration because they really are that
simple for
health to be checking off your basics
we're done with them here's the thing
right now with all of these videos
included including this fifth one
we have a good awesome stable diet maybe
we even have some supplement hydration
stuff figured out
next time we learn how to take the
stable diet and start to manipulate it
on purpose
to get even better health potentially by
eating gaining muscle and gaining weight
if that's what our health requires or
losing fat and losing weight if that's
what our health requires folks
see you next time
