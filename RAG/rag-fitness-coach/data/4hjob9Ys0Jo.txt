folks we are here dr james dr mike it's
the bi-weekly q a we're here to answer
your questions dr mike how's it
going
i'm starving
ooh
i'm sorry to hear that
i'm fine but cutting is real and it's
cool because results are happening so
yahoo
cutting is definitely a bummer
one of those like good benefits high
costs yeah i know uh our viewers and
listeners if you if if you notice me
looking distracted it's because my wife
is shooting like cannonball size
rounds in the backyard so every now and
again it's like the house shakes because
they're shooting off some big ordnance
in our backyard so apologies if i appear
distracted
well before you get shot to death in an
accident another quote-unquote shooting
shall we yes let's do it gotta get this
done before i get shot
excellent daniel brown is uh
good enough on writing long books that
turn into movies and he's here to ask us
a question
downtown daniel brown
he asks is there really such a thing as
training to build muscle density since
i've started my fitness journey i've
definitely gained muscle but i feel
uh
like i lack real muscle thickness
interested to hear your thoughts stocks
love the content as always so my answer
to this is
we're not a hundred percent sure
uh we know
everything there is to know in this
capacity about muscle growth and gain
and there could be
something called muscle density that
we're just not aware of from a research
perspective and a theoretical
perspective
but that i would say is a probably less
than five percent chance
and more than 95 chance is that the idea
of muscle density it just makes no
goddamn sense muscle is muscle you build
it there it is
sometimes you can have muscle that's a
little bit more cycloplasmic in nature
some that's a little bit more
myofibrillar i don't really know what
that means as far as density because i
don't know the difference in actual
measure density between those two but
muscle converts back and forth between
more myofibril and more sarcoplasmic
it's not a very difficult thing to do
so i don't think muscle density is a
thing i think it's mostly like genetics
muscle size and the kind of drugs you're
on to make your muscles look a little
bit different cosmetically and that's
about it so just focus on doing muscle
size getting leaner repeating the
process and eventually people call you
dense james
yeah absolutely as far as i know there's
not really anything to that and i think
a lot of is just like a lot of people
just wear
and i use that term lightly but like
people just look different depending on
how they gain some people will have more
thickness like front to back some people
just have different looks and that kind
of you might look at somebody and be
like yeah that's dense that's a
dense deltoid right there bro it's just
like just somebody who looks cool you
know it's kind of hard to say yeah and
as mike said i don't really feel like
even if it was a thing i don't feel like
the the outcomes of that would be any
different than training to build regular
muscle mass i would actually argue that
if it was a thing it would be more
pertinent to athletics than it would be
bodybuilding just because then you can
deal with things like strength to body
weight ratios that becomes more
important so even if it was a thing i
think it's less important for physique
than it is for sports so i would just
not bust with it too much
it's probably not a thing
next up is henrik anderson who in his
usual glory spears no expense making a
nice
good long question for us that's always
highly upvoted henrik you are the you
are
really well loved by our followers and
our subscribers so yeah no kidding
yeah that's a lot um
he says
you recommend a post workout meal
consisting of little to no fats and fast
digesting carbs for individuals who do
not train twice a day and every muscle
has at least 48 hours of rest between
each session would you still recommend a
fast adjusting post workout if so could
you put a number as to how much more
beneficial it is
is it really going to make a big
difference in the long run so the answer
to that is no probably wouldn't
recommend that and it would be
marginally beneficial by like less than
a percent
uh over the long run and he says for
context i tend to lean you're slow
digesting
post-workout meals due to hunger
management and general lifestyle that's
those are great choices i'm wondering
how big of a difference change in my
post-workout would make us almost none
and possibly because you're managing
hunger better and general lifestyle is
better than it would actually make you
have more gains if you did slower than
existing stuff so uh our fast adjusting
stuff is uh not a post-workout meal
recommendation carte blanche it is a
post-workout meal recommendation of
specific context and if you would like
more about the context the renaissance
diet 2.0 book is where to go for that
james booyah yeah just for some context
because i feel like this comes up a lot
and mike and i fall privy to this
problem when we were graduate students
because
if you look at some of the early
research on nutrient timing it would
have you believe that this was like a
godsend to the earth like god was like
you know what war
famine destruction like natural
resources
don't worry about that high glycemic
carbs fixes everything everyone's good
solves all the problems of the world so
it looked really promising kind of in
like the 2000s era might correct me if
i'm wrong on that um it looked really
good and we everyone thought like god
damn this nutrient timing stuff like
getting those fast glycemic carbs that's
it just fixes everything it makes
everyone so much better you know fast
forward to
2021 the current year and the magnitude
of the effects on that just really
didn't pan out the way we thought that
they would and so that's kind of where a
lot of this disconnect comes from where
it's very clear that there is an effect
right no doubt that there is an effect
that can be elicited from these kind of
nutrient timing type strategies
what we found in the long run is that
the magnitude of those effects just
aren't very powerful and probably are
only important in a very narrow context
of circumstances so it's not really
worth fussing over too much especially i
think this came up on our last q a if
you're if you don't notice any like you
don't have any noticeable
um problems of recovery or your
performance is dropping in weird ways
like you don't have to worry about it
you can just keep doing whatever you're
doing
whatever
off that perfect tangent to
next question asker just below daniel
brown is a little sugar all right so
this if this is a meshuga reference
you're the man and i will i will go back
and listen to chaos fear in your honor
later today
or it's like a shitty rapper name oh
who knows right oh how could you
he says say after lifting for seven
years i have achieved and i'm content
with 80 of my natural potential how do i
go about transitioning to a lifelong
maintenance phase how do i find out if
the maintenance volume is too low
without losing gains in the process
thanks well so
by getting a little bit of a pump a
little bit of a disruption soreness etc
you can nearly guarantee that you won't
lose any gains because if your training
feels super super easy then maybe it's
too much but if it feels like all like
i'm getting into decent stimulus then
it's probably good enough
here's a really cool thing if you gain
if you lose gains in the process
you can always train a little bit higher
than maintenance and get them right back
within a few weeks so it's really not a
problem at all absolutely it's like it's
like trying to like target shoot and
sight your rifle and try to hit the
bullseye but you're like what can i do
to prevent any bullets being fired
outside of that range like well that's
actually just how you cite it as some go
above some go below it's not a big deal
so like there's you can you can just
recite your guns easy fix you can just
regain the muscle no problem you don't
lose muscle permanently
and uh
how would you go about transition to
lifelong maintenance phase is you would
just start training at maintenance
volumes frequencies and intensities
those are specified and are scientific
principles of approach retraining book
i've got a few videos on
um
the rp strength or the roundhouse
verizon youtube maintenance but
generally speaking you stick mostly to
compound movements because they allow
super high efficiency you drop your
volume by something like one half to two
one half to one third of your typical
volume when you're trying to gain muscle
probably go down to one third and see if
you're maintained and if you maintain
then you stay there and if you lose some
size then you increase your farm a
little bit get it back and go from there
and there's a little bit of auto
regulation that has to happen but that's
really kind of the answer and i would
say
training three to four days a week for
an hour at a time uh anywhere between
two and four
maybe two and five
uh s
fats per muscle group per session
is probably good enough for most people
so i would start there james
yeah that was really good suggestion so
you could also go about it a slightly
different way depending on if you if you
like to train hard or not so
uh dr mike gave it from like if you're
trying to reduce the amount of time that
you spend in the gym and and so you can
have a more fulfilling lifestyle that's
absolutely the way to go if you like
training and it's something that you're
going to do anyway then at that point
you really just switch the diet stuff
around and just say i'm not going to do
these dedicated mass or cut phases i'm
mostly going to eat kind of what what i
normally would eat and lock that in for
the long term and then if you want to
train hard and you just enjoy doing that
you're not going to see as much tangible
progress in the short term but you'll
still make marginal gains in strength
over time you'll still see some progress
there but you won't really have to fuss
nearly as much with the diet stuff which
is a huge life improvement and you can
do as much or as little training as you
want and if you want to train a little
bit more great and if you want to do
more of like the maintenance volume
training like mike described that's fine
too anywhere in that range you're good
to go and at that point it's more of an
issue of like how much time do you want
to spend doing food prep and
body weight and calorie tracking blah
blah blah
yeah
next up just below milo wolf there is
fabio dinebag
that sounds like uh so
when i see dimebag my brain either goes
to weed joke or dimebag daryl pantera
reference got two heavy potential heavy
metals here
yeah heavy metal or just total yeah
all right he says at dr mike fabio
unfortunately they add hashtags don't
work on youtube i'm sure you knew that
uh dr mike with all the deaths in
bodybuilding do you have any longevity
safeguards do you have a set time when
you will stop blasting
so yes i do
um in my early to mid 40s as my absolute
cutoff unless i take care of some
professional goals in the sport of
bodybuilding that i have set for myself
which will remain private to me for the
time being
um
but once i hit those goals i'll probably
retire shortly thereafter um
and it's basically goals of how kind of
how i want to look on stage um
you know i could always retire sooner if
the docs say i'm going to die soon
uh but probably in my uh early to mid
40s is when i stopped blasting you know
make good gains after that anyway and
i'll probably uh get down to somewhere
between
180 to 200 pounds and then later
probably
160 to 180 and be
much smaller it'll feel much better
well i will say so with all the deaths
and bodybuilding
um news headlines are very very poor way
to understand the world from a
statistical perspective
i actually don't know if there are more
deaths in bodybuilding this year than
last year or the year before because we
don't collect formal statistics at least
we're not aware of them right now i'm
not
so it's just a couple of high-profile
deaths don't say anything about the base
rates most bodybuilders that die aren't
famous and maybe there are years where
tons of macro level guys died just never
hear about it
so i would say that with all the dust
and bodybuilding it's not a
consideration of mine at all it's just
not clear to me that was even a trend uh
i had longevity standards before and i
plan on implementing them and actually
during this time
of blasting so to speak i still am very
intelligent and take the right
supplements and safeguards and blood
work and everything to make sure that
i'm not just like well while the
getting's good i'm just gonna try to
kill myself but as soon as i'm done then
i back off still trying to do it with
some
definitely a lot of moderation and
intelligence so
that's what it is
i miss anything there james does that
sound
i think that was a great answer uh the
only thing i think with like especially
this year is i feel like the ones that
happened this year were also like very
sudden and unexpected and that's why i
feel like they have maybe carried more
weight than they typically have you guys
didn't look terrible for weeks before or
months before and you're like that guy's
gonna die right yeah yeah no indications
that they were sick at least as far as i
knew um so it was just kind of like that
guy's dead now and we're all like what
are you serious so i think that's kind
of what happened in this year in
particular um but like mike said you
know it does happen i mean in all sports
all sports and activities take a toll on
your life like
if you played rugby for 20 years like
you can imagine that you're going to die
sooner than other people in your family
that didn't play rugby like it's just
part of it's part of
the deal you know yeah and we know we
know steroids are bad for health and all
the other drugs are bad for your health
so we don't have to debate that but also
another thing is like are we so clear we
know the proximate causes for all these
deaths you know
uh with all very very due respect and i
do mean that um
you know one of the recent deaths was
tragically sean rhoden
shawn rhoden is a 300 pound 46 year old
caribbean descent of black man
okay like his chances of having a
cardiac event are actually quite high
anyway
uh because he was a bodybuilder of drugs
it certainly raises the chances the
drugs part the fact that he was lean
most of his life drops the chances i
might actually bring him down to just
about statistical average
black man that weighs 300 pounds at his
age 46.
you are african-american because there's
differences between the races it's bad
to be 300 pounds of age 46 for any race
but a
a male of african ascent coming to the
doctor and
at 846 presenting it somewhere between
250 and 300 pounds
that's not going to have anything good
to tell you as far as your your
longevity like it's just it's period so
people say oh like it was the drugs like
almost certainly they contributed we
really don't know how much and how
things would have been different
and again like mike said you can't use
anecdotes because there's plenty of
people who use drugs less intelligently
that don't die that you never hear about
and vice versa so you know it's just
coleman's still alive
yeah god he's
he's broken he used a lot of drugs for a
long time but still not dead so yeah
all right
what uh nope keeping it to myself
yourself great perfect uh we'll we'll
pick it up after the broadcast
next up is jr right below fabio
youtube's getting a lot more
jr
sorry wwe joke there
he
asks you said in a recent q a that
maintenance volume is much lower than
previously suggested don't quote me with
something like with one third even as
low as 1 16 so it's 1 3 to 1 9
but very close
does that change your stance on volume
during cutting meaning do you still
recommend going from med up to close to
mrv or were you only referring to
maintenance volume at maintenance
calories only at maintenance calories
yes so as your cut progresses
your maintenance volume goes up a lot
because the anabolic drive it takes to
make you not lose muscle on the other
end
from the catabolic drive of the diet
needs to be really high at the end of a
diet
especially a hardcore one
you come close to mrv for your normal
training even on a mass phase just to
keep the muscle on your body
so
yeah i would still train from med up to
close to mrv on a cut because a few
weeks into a cut those start to look
very similar at the end of a cup they
start to look like almost the same
number
yeah that's a big mistake people make
i'm not accusing you of making a jr
but a lot of people will say like why i
just train a maintenance for the cut
like yes iso caloric maintenance during
an unbelievably catabolic time not the
same thing you could be off by
15 sets per muscle group per week or
something like that james you got any uh
have you had experience with clients
getting this is wrong or anything like
that before yeah there's been kind of
like maybe and maybe we're perpetuating
this in some way but there's kind of
this notion of like well if you're doing
a cut then maybe you could do like kind
of easy er
training like you don't have to
do like super super duper mrv training
and yeah that might be true but it's
also more of a gamble that you're doing
at the same time so at that point it's
like do like re you know as what mike
and i would call like reasonable auto
regulated training where you feel like
you're definitely getting some pump some
disruption some stimulus and it's
probably should be above your
maintenance calorie maintenance volumes
for sure during a cut if you're
if you're do if you're doing the up the
other direction where you're just trying
to do like as little training as
possible during your cut it kind of begs
the bigger question of like why are you
doing this at all like why
yeah go and get it
yeah if it can save you a lot of fatigue
cool but if you lose muscle on a cut at
the end of the cut you can regain it but
at the end of the cut you don't look
that great for example if you have to
put yourself in a bodybuilding stage or
transformation photo body transformation
yes you want to end up on the slightly
other side of maybe doing a little too
much and then having to manage a little
bit too much versus doing too little and
then the d you can manage you keep the
muscle but if you lose the muscle then
it takes a few weeks to get it back and
then you just will look sort of deflated
yeah and our point on the like this this
thing on maintenance volume being lower
than we think it seems to just our bar
for maintenance volume just keeps to
seemingly drop over the years
is that kind of the point being is that
once you gain muscle and it's stuck
around for a minute
it's pretty hard for you to really lose
it on like a permanent scale it's one of
those things where like if you gain the
muscle
you don't have to do a whole lot to keep
it outside of like just not training and
dieting to lose weight really hard other
than that even if you do lose it it
seems like it comes back really really
easily so more often than not if you are
trying to
reduce your training loads for fatigue
management purposes you can go pretty
low and not have to worry like am i
losing a little bit of size on my delts
this week like
probably not did you do something did
you like pick up a backpack or you know
write something on a on a piece of paper
you're probably good
all right next up just below jr is
daniel machen
he says hey doc you want to talk about
adam's swing who can he
we will actually it's on the list
uh that's an easy one uh so daniel asks
hey doc hope you're both doing well i
was wondering what i could do the
following if i miss a few training
sessions during the current week if that
makes sense
i'm currently in a masking phase and i
train frequency six days a week due to
work and other life commitments
sometimes i struggle with my frequency
and therefore volume for the week for
example i may do two to three weeks of
really good training then the following
week i only train three or four times a
week i was wondering what i could do the
next week to get back on track
uh would i use the previous week as a
mini deload
would i redo the previous week or just
pick up where i left from last week
would love to hear your recommendations
on this topic thanks uh both in advance
so actually the the recommendation is
generally pretty simple
you have to modify your plan
and the way the modification works is
the following
for days that you actually successfully
hit you move on to that day next week
for days that you didn't hit you do what
you were supposed to last week but
didn't that means your days get mixed up
but really it's all the same exercises
and everything you just alter the set
numbers and alter
the uh rep targets and there you go
um
if you miss more than one week
it opens up a bit of a fractal of things
you could be doing uh the best
recommendation is to not get yourself in
the situation
and actually just only do four or five
days a week consistently
um you could also have so that you don't
get into the situation where you miss
days all the time you have to with
it another one is to have um
uh kind of like a baseline plus floating
schedule where you have a baseline
schedule if you have to hit four days a
week must hit and then if you have extra
volume that week that you can spare
because of time you have two options
workouts you can insert at the end of
that week so if you know your week
coming up it's like okay i have two more
uh one lower body one upper body session
that i do friday saturday because i have
the time but if it's coming up friday
saturday you don't you just hit your
baseline week um
no need to do anything super complicated
and really altering your program etc but
honestly my best advice is don't get
yourself into that situation pick
a baseline plan you can stick to or a
baseline plan with optional floating
workouts to add in and then you don't
have to feel like you're backtracking
all the time
james
yeah absolutely so um what i would do
with my clients um if this is like a
once in a meso kind of like ah something
came up it's not something that happens
like every other week it's just like i
had a week something came up
more often than not i'll just say just
just
do the same workouts in the same order
that you would normally do it and now
your schedule's just going to be a
little mixed up from what you normally
do
and just go from there it's not a big
deal you know it's basically is taking
one of the weeks that you would have
done and instead of having it be one
week it ends up being a little bit
longer than that and you kind of reorder
the days of your workout and
at the end of the day it's really not a
big deal i think the the the bigger
issue which mike hit on and totally
nailed is
if this is something that happens
very regularly like this is like every
two or three weeks kind of thing
then you need to back off from six days
per week and just pick a schedule that
you could do reliably and consistently
and then you can just take those so
instead of doing six days a week maybe
you just switch to four times a week and
then you just get after it on those four
days a little bit harder and when i say
a little bit harder i just mean you know
um
not training to failure or anything like
that just meaning like yeah you maybe
add some exercises and fill in that
missing training stimuli that you would
have gotten on the six days a week and i
think you're probably better off doing
that from a consistency standpoint over
time than getting into these uh kind of
like juggling mezzo's uh month-to-month
kind of situation so i think dr mike
nailed it there and and
this is not meant to be insulting in any
way i understand completely a lot on
this podcast yeah um i get that
comes up
there is something to be said about
discipline right where if it is
important to you
and you want to make it happen
and you've committed to six times a week
 do it and then don't come back
later and say like oh i had this like
really bad homework assignment or
whatever like yeah happens do it
anyway and if it's really bad if you
have legitimate things that come up that
are disruptive in your life like maybe
you uh are a new parent you have to deal
with kids or maybe you're dealing with
um you know a sick family member any of
those things understandable pick to a
schedule that you can commit to but
there's always going to be things in
your way so at some point you do kind of
have to bite down on your your gum
shield as they would say in england and
uh just get her done you know and just
be disciplined about it when when
motivation fails you've got to lean on
that discipline
yeah
yeah
next up
adam swink
asks
who can hip thrust more mike or james
well my best hip thrust ever was i think
like 185 for a set of 10 and i was like
this exercise was found as rocks i'm
 done with it i believe james has
done a lot more james i have done more
but it's one of those it's kind of like
leg press like i don't like the numbers
don't even register to me as like it's
just like what you know whatever i i
just hip thrusted
255 or whatever you know it's like who
cares it's one of those weird exercises
normally when it's like who's stronger
mike or james i mean 95 of the time
maybe even more it's mike by a long shot
i remember so um mike and i had a
colleague we call him coach tim uh at
etsu he was a weightlifter he was one of
the weightlifting coaches actually
 looked like thor he was
jacked he had a very smart spoken voice
so he'd be like hi my name's tim um and
i used to try and compete with tim
because he was like a strong guy and the
only thing i could compete with tim on
was deadlifts and him and i would go
like toe to toe on deadlifts but then he
would squat like 405 for a set of 10 and
i'd be like yeah i'm working out 275
over here uh
so yeah strength competition i am not
your man but hip thrust is one of those
like silly ones too where it's like it
doesn't matter it's like leg press like
some people are just really strong and
like press other people aren't it's okay
all right next up believe it or not is
frank sinatra
whoa the one and only frank sinatra
reborn to ask questions
all right
frank says dear good doctor something
very serious has occurred and your help
is most definitely needed i cannot get a
 pump
in the good old days i used to get the
most mind bending pumps skin tearing
arms floating away systemic capillary
orgasms very beautiful
but it's been three years since i've
been able to get a decent pump all the
boxes have been duly checked massive
extended caloric surplus
800 gram carbs deloads long d-load
spiritization goodbye muscle connection
hydration ramen noodles
heavy weights light weights full rock
partial rum
even watching pumping iron while doing
pack flies that's a really uh oh
my god
no matter the workout or type of
conditions especially happen anymore
coincidentally i've also not grown one
spec since the pumps left i've been
training for eight years
i then
fled with my adrenal cortexes to make
sure they're on top of their aldosterone
game not sure if they listened am i just
over the hill is 26 simply too old to
achieve newer bus pops yeah 26 uh makes
it done so if you were 46 yeah you were
46 i'd be like you're just becoming an
old man uh 26 is real real very very too
young to do this
i'm lots of confused feel the only very
purpose of the gym slipping through my
cold fingers
yeah dot dot dot so i would say uh my so
you you actually ran through all the
recommendations i was going to say
um
including deloading and long d loading
usually gets the pumps going i would go
and get comprehensive blood work to make
sure everything's fine in that regard
that's probably my first recourse there
sorry but that would be what i would
tell a client or something james
yeah i would uh and maybe maybe this is
just a semantics thing but i would do
kind of a hard reset on training i would
take like three weeks just off no
training period like no training at all
and if you come back after not lifting
at all for three weeks and can't get a
pump like something's not going to the
doctor
go to the doctor
i mean i know it's trust me this is like
the last thing i would want to say is
like don't lift for three weeks but
that's what i would call like a hard
reset where it's like at that point if
if your mvv's not like two sets like
something's up
yeah
next up is i'm christina is watching
dropping iron while he's lit more can
you ask a lot
so folks shout out to um dos gym in
austria they have one of the most fun
gym setups i've ever experienced in my
life in addition to just being a great
facility with lots of great equipment
and great staff and great just um
nostalgia of the gym all around they'll
have like on one megatron over here
they'll have like a dvd of like
metallica playing live and over here
they'll have like videos of like ronnie
coleman or arnie doing workout training
you know pumping up and so it's like
you're you're you're there pumping up
and you're watching them pop up and
there's music and oh my god what a
setting
it's a trip man i i
yeah wow
if i didn't know what to do when i first
got to the gym it's a good gym and a
museum in the same place it is it is
they have a whole bunch of like
memorabilia from all these different
action movie stars and stuff if you're
ever kind of like in the vienna area
it's worth a trip over there because
it's a great facility to train at first
of all and it's just like it's kind of
like an amusement park for fitness
people it's really fun
all right next up is christina
c-h-r-i-s-t-i-m-a
oh
yeah this one is off somewhere else
sorry there we go
excuse me all right
hello all right
christina asks hi docs i was wondering
about how much money slash endurance
training you get away with before it
starts to interfere with hypertrophy and
strength gains
i'm a former long-distance runner but i
got burned out and switched my focus to
weightlifting i still want to
incorporate running and mountain biking
in my training schedule because of
cardiovascular benefits and high total
daily energy expenditure
but these are my preferred vessels of
cardio oh and these are my preferred
vessels of cardio
at the moment i run around two times per
week for 30 or 45 minutes and heart rate
zones two to four
mountain biking is more around once per
week uh or two weeks and about one to
two hours predominantly in zone one i'm
okay with small interference say 80 of
normal gains
i'd say that's pretty big interference
but no worries
i don't want to bust my ass in the gym
for half the results because of cardio
i already
split cardio and weightlifting for more
than six hours between or just my off
days of lifting as recommended for the
science i've read however i didn't find
any concrete numbers and how much
percentage with cardio interferes that
they don't exist you can stop looking
for them whenever you whenever you like
um because it would be so individually
specific and context-specific it
wouldn't even be an answer it's hard to
how much interference i purchased
strengths would love to know your
opinions about this topic so what i
would do
is i would say you continue to do the
cardio you're doing now and monitor your
rate of gains and lifting
and i would up the cardio just
marginally and another session of
running in another session of cycling
give it a month or two see how your
lifting is treating you if you can tell
yourself man
i'm definitely feeling this
cardio and the results are not as good
back back off if you increase the cardio
everything's golden
stay there or increase again sooner or
later you will find when the lifting
really takes a hit and here's the good
news and we've already answered a
similar question earlier as soon as you
back away from cardio and lift a little
bit more and recover more and eat more
you'll get all your gains let you lost
back if you lose any gains or if your
gains slow down they will speed back up
as soon as you tear down on the cardio
so because you're not asking us a
question just out of the blue you're
ready to do some cardio you're in a
really good position to have a baseline
already and you know you're good with
these results increase cardio just a
little see if you're still good with the
results and go from there
because we can tell you like oh xyz in
our experience blah blah
individual variation eats all that up so
um i wouldn't even want to get that
answer maybe james can give a general
answer but i would say
that's my
yeah that was a that was a great
response um so a couple couple things
and this is just me being sorry so
my response will differ depending on
whether you meant weightlifting one word
or weightlifting two words because that
actually changes it significantly um if
you and this is again
me being but if you are doing
weight lifting one word then the cardio
stuff that you're doing
the more distinct interference effect
right versus if you're just doing like
hypertrophy or strength training that
will not be as profound as is was
weightlifting one word um so that being
said um either way
the amount of interference that you get
from this stuff is is directly
proportional to how much of each that
you're doing it goes
kind of in both directions more so on
the side of endurance interferes with
gains from resistance training than the
other direction but it does go both ways
and so kind of the short answer is the
more running the more endurance stuff
you do the more potential for
interference effects what are the
magnitude of those effects oh my god
they're so small it's really
insignificant for somebody who's just
trying to live a fit and healthy
lifestyle i mean we're not even talking
she gave the example like 80 of normal
gains dude we're talking like
97.5 percent of normal gains unless
you're doing a shitload to the point
where as mike said you can tell like i
got no juice in my legs i can't even hit
an overloading stimulus for this
training session that's when you start
running into more substantial
interference effects but if you're not
running into that we're talking very
very very minute things i have a client
who is
probably very much like yourself she
likes to do mountain biking she does
snowshoeing she does skiing snowboarding
uh i don't think she runs but she does a
lot of these endurance kind of type
activities
and she does a full
full on hypertrophy program the thing is
like
if you are a type one person and if you
have been gravitating towards cardio
activities most of your life you're
probably more of that type one
style you're not going to be making huge
gains on the resistance side anyway and
your systemic and local mrvs are so high
it's like a drop in the bucket so in
this case it's like could you be doing
more resistance training yeah probably
are you going to be making like that
much more gains if you did no
so you might as well just what you want
anyway
that's what my client in this instance
and we actually had a talk i've been
working with this person for years
and you know kind of did the normal like
hey if you want to be really jacked like
you gotta put more effort into the stuff
that makes you jacked and less into this
other stuff and then she finally came
back to me and said you know hey we've
been kind of doing this for a while and
i'm really happy with how things have
gone but these other things like doing
the mountain biking and snowshoeing and
skiing and all that stuff really makes
me happy and i want to keep that
more part of my life just because i
enjoy it so much and i said yeah that
makes perfect sense of course and so she
just does more of that we do a little
bit less weight training and guess what
she makes roughly the same progress that
she was making before anyway so like
just go for it if it makes you happy
it's not a big deal yeah i totally agree
last is
karen
terenggar productions taran r-t-e-r-a-n
oh there it is what is that is that a
orangutan what is that avatar
yeah i assume it is
all right the question today
is last question for us by the way
hi dr mike dreams i'm calculating
protein intake for building muscle
should you use your current body weight
whatever that may be or should you use
lean body weight banks in advance
so
it depends on what number you're using
if you use
numbers from studies that are calculated
off lean body mass use those they tend
to be lower
if you use numbers from studies
calculated on total body mass use those
with one caveat and the caveat is if you
are very very fat uh sorry that's a very
mean way to say it uh if you're over 20
to 30 body fat as a male or 30 to 40
percent as a female
then
what you might want to do is make a
choice
you can eat though a gram per pound or
whatever but that'll be a lot of protein
the downside is it's a lot of protein
and some extra for sure you don't need
to grow muscle the upside is
people who tend to be that fat often
have appetite issues that is they have
excessive appetite and that extra amount
of protein can actually zap that
and then it's better so for fat loss
diets but one really hilarious complaint
to hear from folks
who are very over fat is oh i can't eat
all this food on a diet like
 i don't doubt that you can
eat the food nobody doubt that
like but for a more compassionate place
like it can be annoying to eat extra
protein when a diet of more veggies or
carbs would be better and
less protein what i would say is if
you're relatively lean
under
fat for male 1 under 30 for female
i would go with a per body weight
numbers no problem gram per pound if you
want to get extra persnickety you can
always use the lbm reference numbers
from various meta analyses
and if you're over fat by a considerable
margin i would pick a number between
those two or sorry between what you're
you know say 300 pounds should you eat
300 grams of protein your lbm is only
200 pounds but maybe you eat anywhere
between those two is fine fine answer
you can eat as little as 200 but i would
start with like 250 somewhere between
the two and uh see how your
uh quality of life and diet choices and
annoyance of paying money for and eating
and chewing a bunch of protein go and if
you like it then 250 is great even 300
degrees uh and if you don't like it then
go closer to 200 and you may find uh
better probably not better results but
better ability to adhere to them and
enjoy them
yeah absolutely actually one of uh i use
this word lightly but one of the common
complaints it's not really a complaint
it's more of just an observation for
people who start at rp when they're
doing a weight loss diet one of the
first things we hear all the time is
like god i feel like i'm eating so much
and it's like because they're not used
to because most people you know for a
meal they might just have some like
spaghetti you know or like some string
cheese or something so they're not used
to actually eating like crackers protein
crackers yeah exactly um so then you
start putting them on like three ounces
or four ounces of protein per meal four
to six times a day and they're like oh
what the is this i don't want to
eat anymore i don't even want to eat all
these carbs and you're like this is a
good problem remember this moment about
uh 10 weeks from now you might be
singing a different tune but enjoy it
while it lasts
but sometimes it is super annoying so
you can lower the protein if you like
and then raise it later when you get
more hungry
absolutely
that's it i felt like that was a quick
one we ripped through those today
i guess yeah these these were the top
questions it was a very well watched
episode and everything it's just
sometimes the questions are just more
in-depth than
maybe even the questions that are
sometimes in depth can be answered
quickly and sometimes maybe we just rant
long enough i don't know maybe we're
just that damn good um so like any rp or
dr mike or any other housekeeping items
what's going on anything interesting
follow me on instagram
dr mike is ratel
on instagram i'm no longer rp dr mike
it's a new one let's see do i have
anything going on still trying to get my
old account back but the chances of that
are incrementally falling
ugh that's such a bummer um let's see
uh yeah
just
i always have secret projects i can't
talk about them yeah i know which is why
every time you bring up this like do you
have any announcements i'm always like
no
well you always have like videos and
stuff that are always coming out that's
right your videos are always super
popular
but then the announcements like we got
videos coming out well i will say we
recorded a bunch of videos for the
holiday period so we got a lot of really
good holiday areas going on some
contentious subjects even involving
anabolics
anabolic santa
pretty sweet he brings you gains or he's
just really jacked or both
he needs uh insulin from all those
cookies that he's pounding
he like gets down the chimney ultra
quick because he's having a like
hypoglycemic episode
[Music]
sweating like crazy like santa you're
okay he's like oh the are you he's
like let him renorm he'll take five
minutes he'll be fine oh my god all
right folks great questions as always um
just a reminder if you guys want to
submit a question you can post it on the
most recent q a with uh mike and james
and what we usually recommend yeah on
this one and we usually recommend that
you just kind of give it a quick scroll
through on the comments because somebody
might have posted some comments that you
actually think are pretty interesting
and if you do find those give them an
upvote we saw uh we have some some
consistent deliverers henrik anderson mr
44 this week very good um so you're
welcome to post any questions you want
we're going to take the top 10 either
most upvoted is what we usually go to or
if we just happen to see one that's
particularly spicy we'll grab that too
but usually we do top ten so thanks
again for submitting your questions keep
uploading other people's pay it forward
and we will see you next time
