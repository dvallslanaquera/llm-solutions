hey folks doctor mike kosciel here for
renaissance periodization rp
plus hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture
31 second to last in this series
this short 31 lecture series
we're going to take all of the lectures
that we have learned from already all
the other 30
and you have hopefully seen and if you
haven't seen those
this lecture is going to be a little bit
confusing at times and some holes will
not be uh
sort of evident to be filled but we're
going to take all the other 30 we're
going to combine them into
sort of the the whole point of this
into lecture one of building a sample
program so we're going to use all the
hypertrophy concepts and tools
to build a program in the next lecture
lecture 32
we're going to learn how to modify that
program once it has been built
and then you're free as a bird let go
out of its cage
to go get eaten by a cat right at the
window but maybe if you make it further
than that you can be jacked
so here's the deal building a sample
program
you hopefully have watched
and understood and integrated into your
thinking the preceding 30 videos
and you should be more than ready to
build a program so now that you're ready
to build a program
we're going to go through each step of
the program and we're going to build one
together and
we're going to illustrate this sort of
step by step point by point
and hopefully this can streamline or
inform your own process of program
design and remember that this is a
sample program
they're not all going to look like this
but all the principles and concepts that
we're going to use
apply to every single program design
there are as far as we're doing it this
time
roughly seven steps in the program
design process
the first step is a needs analysis which
we've discussed a really long time ago
really really really big deal comes out
of the specificity principle
after that when we know what the client
needs
we have sort of a containment boundary
around what we can do
and what we have to do then we start
actually doing the actual designing
point number two is a total frequency
selection that's really advanced
language for how many times a week are
they going to train
not their muscles like not the bicep or
the chest or the calves
but like how many times can they come to
the gym right
then number three is assigning actual
muscle groups to all those sessions so
how many of those are going to be chest
how many biceps so on and so forth
number four is selecting exercises and
the training methods to go with them
so are we doing barbell rows for
straight sets or are we doing cable rows
for my reps things like that
after that we select the volumes of
training that we're going to have in
week number one
only because after that lecture two will
take over and auto regulation will be
put in place point six second to last is
selecting the loads we'll be using again
in week one
and then seven is going to be selecting
reps in reserve how far
away from failure we're going to be
again in week one and then at the
conclusion of this entire thing
we'll have built a program and you will
have hopefully as well
that's ready to go but it's ready to go
for one week and after that
lecture 32 will take over to show us how
that program will be modified
so needs analysis you have to figure out
first and foremost why you're writing
the program
who for it's a really really big deal
and you need at least a couple of these
basics and probably some more
stuff in your own needs analysis but
here's a sort of quick preview an
example of how you would do it
you need the person's training age okay
how long have they been training
hard with weights or remotely at all
with weights there's people
who've been training with weights for 15
years they need a very different set of
tools a very different looking program
than someone has been training with
weights for a year and everything in
between
biological age you do not design the
same kind of program for a 16 year old
as you do a 60 year old
specific exercise experience if
someone's never done hack squats before
you may not throw them into the program
right away especially if they train
really far away from you
if someone hasn't done some very
advanced exercises then you may not do
them
but if someone has done a bunch of
different exercises you may start with
those exercises
so they get a feel for everything that
your program looks like and then
eventually
add in some new ones huge one goals
that's why it's all in capital letters
what are their goals people with
different goals and different desires
uh want to do different things some
people have the goal of getting as big
of legs as possible upper body
just arms and emphasis here and emphasis
there so on and so forth
limitations are big back when i first
started designing programs when i was
not remotely qualified to be doing so of
course
i had no education whatsoever i was sort
of on my way to maybe starting to get it
soon
i would design these what i thought were
great programs that didn't take
limitations into account at all
people said okay i actually can't do
squats because i'm hurt
on my knees i just don't do squats what
else can i do and i'm like ah ah
well then you can't do a program well
that doesn't make any sense you have to
take limitations under account there's a
couple
injuries are definitely something you
want to take account and there's a bunch
of other ones but the other big example
here is time constraints okay you don't
want to write someone a program that
they can't finish
and they don't have time for really good
way to set up somebody for low adherence
and failure
preferences okay in a more technical way
they may have a clue as to their highest
sfr exercises
so you kind of want to know those you
know you say hey like we have a choice
here
to put either incline barbell pressing
or incline dumbbell pressing
say as far as an analytical perspective
it doesn't really so much matter they're
both compound presses
we're going to do both in the 10 to 20
rep range so it's a three-year call
they may very well have clients
oftentimes and athletes
uh say i hate dumbbell presses i love
viral presses and vice versa
or they may not care if they don't care
it's easy you just do whatever you want
but they may care
right some people say you can say you
know to a client hey listen
what are the exercises you like to do
for these muscle groups and you give
them a list
what are your favorites and sometimes
they'll say look i don't know and then
great that's that's actually the easy
answer
the more difficult answer but
nonetheless very tractable is when they
say ah here's what i really love and i
can actually rank order these exercises
based on which ones i really like how
they feel they really
pose no threat to my joints and here's
the ones that i really hate so on and so
forth and then awesome because they just
gave you an sfr rank list for
for lack of a better term and
after you know these then you begin to
write a plan not before
okay a lot of folks will send me
programs
on instagram and i almost never check
them but every now and again it's
somebody i know
they'll send me a program and they'll
say hey what do you think of this and i
don't know their needs analysis but i
don't know anything about them i just
know that they're an instagram avatar
and like what do you think of this
program i can't tell you what i think of
this program i have no idea about the
background
right if i know the background then i
can say okay this program is stupid as
fuck you're an idiot all right or it's
actually great and i should hire you
sample client so we're going to each one
of these we're going to talk about the
theoreticals and we're going to
demonstrate them being used on a sample
client that somebody i just created out
of thin air
so we'll say training age for this
client is five years they've been
training relatively hard or with weights
in the gym for five years
their biological age is 40. so they're
40 years old cool but someone with a
pretty mature but no crazy limitations
and they're not like geriatric or
anything
specific exercise experience this person
has done essentially all basic compounds
and most machines
so this is big because when you're like
leg press they're like yep
done it i know the one at my gym works
really great i really like it that's
you're way ahead of the game as opposed
to your like squat and they're like
that's the thing with your arms
ooh okay we're gonna have to take a
different route with this right
their goals just as this example is they
wanna enhance hypertrophy of the whole
body super just want to get jacked all
over
limitations they say they have no
limiting injuries right and the injuries
things are
rather uh simple to deal with we won't
be dealing with in this example but
injuries are pretty straightforward you
just say okay what can't you do
what hurts beyond uh you know beyond
reproach and they say okay this i can't
do this i can't do that i can't do
you stay away from that and then maybe
you start to weave it in light later and
it turns out they can't really do it if
they change their techniques so on and
so forth but it's injury it's just a
matter of staying away from stuff
and bothering them but no limiting
injuries for this fake gentleman here
and he says you know realistically he
can only train five times a week and one
and a half hours per session
he's got wife and kids at home he gets
off work at five they expect to see him
at eight there's some traffic in between
one and a half hours all he can give
okay sweet
preferences uh this person's like look i
i i don't really like machines i like
hardcore compound barbell work i feel
the best there
and i really just would want to do more
of it and to you that's like oh sweet
that's not a big deal to me so at least
for the first mesocycle while we're
exploring
we can absolutely cater to your
preferences
so now we know the client we move on to
the next step
of total frequency selection and that's
how many days a client can train
per week total not per muscle group that
comes second
or after this it has to be a low ball
estimate
okay because you don't get any extra
credit for missed sessions and you
actually get downgraded for missed
sessions okay
a lot of people will say look like i
want to train
six days a week i say okay can you
they're like
man i can for sure train five but six
that'd be tough
that's okay if i write you a six day a
week training program
at least twice during the motorcycle
you're going to tell me hey i never got
in saturday what do i do
the answer to that is there's nothing
pretty to do it's
it's a it's a big problem on the
analytical front it's a big problem to
miss sessions because you have a lack of
data
uh about auto-regulating sessions that
came before
and you have a lack of stimulus and a
feed-forward problem and a feedback
problem
missing sessions is a bad deal and also
the number of sessions you per week does
correlate with hypertrophy but it's a
curvilinear relationship
you don't get a ton more out of six
sessions versus five sessions
so if someone can for sure make four or
five you take them for sure
worst case scenario if a month later a
message later they
knocked every session out of the
ballpark they never missed one and they
go look dudes honestly i can't actually
make
five sessions not four like i said you
can always add five
but when you add five they feel great
about it when you subtract one because
they sucked
no one feels good about that so low
ballpark low bar rock you can always
move up
moving down is more painful and moving
up so for the sample client they said
they could do six days a week when you
talk to them
but they sort of look tentative right a
lot of times clients will want to
impress you
and sort of want to convey an air of
dedication
so you'll you know hit them up over
email or whatever or you talk to them on
the phone or in person at your gym
and they say how many days a week can
you train and they're like well i'm my
room you're serious i'm really serious
right so what do you think
i think six yeah six i think i think six
is doable you got a monday
thing gotta move but yeah yeah six
you're like man
boy that did not sound convincing at all
and you say okay what about five
and they go oh my god five for sure no
problem five easy monday through friday
easy take it do it so
we're gonna choose five sessions for
this sample it's the clear choice
and if the sixth one floats up over the
course of several mesos we'll take that
as well
next point next step is to assign uh
muscle groups to sessions
so first of all you have to figure out
what days of the week the client can
train
reliably okay number of days per week
and which days they train on are two
different things
okay you can train four days a week but
it's monday tuesday wednesday thursday
odd program
or you can train four days a week and
you can train monday tuesday thursday
friday
much better program because it's spread
more evenly throughout the week and how
you cluster muscle groups will
change based on that so not only should
you before you assign muscle groups to
assignments to sessions
you should get an idea of when they can
put their sessions and better to have
just distinct days like thursday you do
this
not like we have four days a week that's
called a floating schedule when you give
someone just four sessions a week
do them whatever that has its downsides
it's definitely a good thing for people
that need
it but most people don't need it and the
extra flexibility
comes at a at a downside it comes at a
cost of
sort of program fluidity so if they
don't need it which most people don't
most people on a pretty good schedule
they know where their lives are going
especially people at work nine to five
just put them on a schedule of thursday
you do this not like day four you do
this or something like that
so once you figure out that figured out
uh you can
put your muscle groups sort of rather
symmetrically dump them into the program
and uh if the priority is on certain
muscles
then you can decide higher frequency if
the other muscles are being
deprioritized lower frequency
right and in general use a frequency
especially when you're beginning with
someone of two to four times per week
for muscle group
right and that's pretty straightforward
so
you know you have like you can train
chest twice a week and back twice a week
and legs twice a week
and then arms and shoulders four times a
week so you can distribute that the weak
as you see fit
as long as it's relatively symmetrical
if you don't want to do chest monday
chest tuesday
and then the rest of the week no chest
you want to do like chest monday chest
thursday
back monday back thursday and then legs
and arms on
you know legs and arms and shoulders on
uh
tuesday friday and then you know a bit
of arm work as well on the monday
thursday after the push pull boom there
you go there's a magic split i made up
my head right
fairly evenly symmetrically split later
as the client does the program
you can actually see feedback on how
your selected frequency is working
and you can alter that as needed right
because we're going to have some auto
regulation to play with we're going to
have data on how good is our frequency
and we can slowly inch it up or inch it
down per muscle group
as required so for the sample client
uh they're doing full body and they have
five days a week to do it
and you talk to them and they say monday
through friday is their best bet like
weekends or you know
family and all this other stuff there
are tons of splits to do
and splits uh as a couple of people have
sort of pointed out recently very well
uh eric helms and his team jeff nippard
uh
splits are really magic about splits
they're a very top-down way of looking
at things it's better to look at things
bottom up in this case
you train muscle groups when they're
ready to be trained when they're
recovered from their past training and
you train them two to four times a week
and whenever they fall
whenever they fall so
for our example we'll just use a split
that hits legs chest and back two times
a week
and shoulders and arms three times a
week because they tend to recover faster
and can be trained more often that's it
so in this split we have monday quads
hams and calves tuesday chest side delts
triceps biceps and so on and so forth
feel free to pause the video at this
time and read the rest of the split you
guys know how to read i won't do it for
you
so here's our split it's not the split
it's a split and if you make your split
differently
no big deal
now we go into the next step of
selecting exercises and training methods
to start you can use more client
favorites if they don't have any
you're the artist do whatever you like
but
make sure skip down to the last point
there
to match the exercises in the position
of the workout and the training method
you already know how to do this remember
compound heavy basics earlier in the
exercise
and isolation movements and especially
movements that require
uh or when you're doing things like maya
reps and drop sets later in the workout
okay so make sure that you don't do like
my rub cable curls first
and then do rows after that with a
barbell
all the way around is a really good idea
and so on and so forth
start with movements that the client is
experienced with
and then you can also introduce new
movements slowly over the course of the
next and
the following mesocycles after that so
for the first night cycle we're gonna
have all the same exercises
we're gonna play it conservative to
whatever the client's used to more or
less
if we have a lot of access to the client
if we are their personal trainer we can
add new movements uh probably in the
second mezzo or even some of the first
but we're gonna see how they do with
their favorites and if they don't have
favorites there's
the more core foundational movements are
probably best to start with
and then we're going to thread out after
that
notice there's a big piece missing here
which are the best exercises we already
know that based on sfr
and rsm and sdr and all the other stuff
you need so there you go you have a
whole lecture to
several lectures to go back to on that
so for our sample client
we're going to insert exercises here and
you can see them all here so for quads
we do have our squats hamstrings lying
leg curls cows machine calves for just
monday
and you can read all the other days
notice that on wednesday for back we
have two exercises
and then down there the little asterisk
says that if you have an exercise in
which they'll need
more than six sets per muscle group for
sure
at any point towards the end of
accumulation
then you probably want to use two
exercises per muscle group to start
so you know you're going to be doing 10
sets of back you don't want to just pick
barbell rows for back that day
you want to pick barbell rows and pull
ups or something like that
next selecting volumes so check this out
we already have
our weekly plan we have all the muscle
groups we want to train
and we have all the exercises picked out
sweet now feel free to pause this and
take a look at the exercises
again just ideas but they should uh
concord
pretty well with our principles that
we've established and what exercises
should generally go first and should go
last and so on and so forth
and now it's time to select volumes
which is again very easy because you've
watched all the other 30 lectures
we just start at mev estimates for each
muscle group minimum factor volume how
do you know that well
you have some good literature on it from
comprehensive reviews like that have
james krieger of weightalogy.net has
published roughly
you know the volume range for best
adaptations is something like
three-ish to 10-ish sets per uh muscle
group per session
so you're going to start in the two to
four range unless you have a lot of data
on the client from before
and if the client has trained with you
before and you're trying to sort of
scientific
program design for the first time or to
try and sharpen up your tools or they
come to you and they report what they've
done and maybe their mvv is very low or
maybe it's much higher
start you know always play conservative
no matter what they say but some
sometimes conservatives too and
sometimes conservatives five sets per
session per
per muscle group when you're starting
them
uh lower is almost always better than
higher
moving up is easy moving down requires
an admission of guilt sort of defeat
and also it uh sort of poisons the well
to some extent with a huge amount of
front loaded fatigue and risks injury
uh right up up front because injury risk
is actually predicated considerably on
how much you elevate volume one week to
another if it's a big jump it could be
not great so they could be deloading and
then you go
and they get hurt um so it's always time
to move forward after
um best analogy there since i'm still
dieting and reason restaurant analogies
all the time
uh best analogy there is uh you know if
you go to an all-you-can-eat buffet
start out with a small plate because you
can always just go get another plate
right but if you get like 10 plates in
front of you and
you finish like three of them and your
eyes were bigger than your stomach then
it's it's embarrassing and annoying and
you just cost the buffet a lot of money
and there's people in africa that don't
have food that whole thing
all right so for the sample client we
just assigned volumes so for example for
monday
four sets of high bar squats to start
that's week one three sets of lying leg
curls five sets of machine calves and so
on and so forth
you can look at all these volumes uh at
your leisure by just simply pausing the
video
and remember there's nothing magical
about these they're just sort of in that
pretty decent range and this would be
something you would
sort of figure out on the fly with the
client and take into consideration their
a their
training history and so on and so forth
now it's time to select loads so we have
a pretty good program so far if we go
back
to the last slide with the sample client
program
and we have uh you know the all the
volumes there
we've got the days we've got the muscle
groups we have the exercises and we have
the starting volume this is really good
now we select loading and we already
know the loading ranges
5 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30. we're going
to buy us
uh the early in the week loads higher
so monday tuesday let's see what days
are the training on scroll back monday
tuesday
wednesday thursday friday so monday
tuesday are probably going to have a bit
more heavy loading
and thursday friday is probably gonna
have a bit more lighter loading and
wednesday might be sort of intermediate
right and uh we're gonna of course match
loading to exercise order in session
heavier exercises first lighter ones
later
and of course match loading to exercise
on method type you know isolated machine
stuff probably on the lighter end
and compound barbell dumbbell stuff
especially barbell stuff on the heavier
end
uh not rocket science and all the
justification and education for that is
in the other videos
on load management and so on and so
forth that we've done so far in the
series so
for the sample client again just a
sample we have
uh there it says you know monday
just uh well actually let's pick another
day because we're going to badgering
monday
thursday is our other leg day we start
with three sets of stiff legged
deadlifts in the five to ten
rep range okay great four sets of leg
presses and a 10 to 20 rep range and
that'll wake you up
and then five sets of calf raises in the
20 30 rep range awesome that looks
pretty good
so you can pause this anytime you like
and take a look at the specifics i've
chosen here just examples but they
should
again fit well with our sort of
preconceived ideas about how this should
work
and then uh the easiest part to
selecting reps in reserve there's really
no magic here
usually you just go three or four reps
in reserve on the first week
and we'll go out from there of course if
the individual is time constrained
and their total volume over the week
especially even if they go into
accumulation will just never get high
enough to really even touch their mrv
then uh usually it means they can do
like only three or four sessions a week
sometimes even five or six
but they can only train for an hour hour
and a half at a time or they just really
they recover very easily and maybe
they're not very strong um
and if they're sort of time consuming
that way you can start with like 2 rir
even more aggressively for a first time
program i would start at
no more than 2 ir because you want to
let people sort of
swim before they before they start free
falling
so you select rars and now we just put
them right in so we have uh this next
thing so
tuesday we have incline bench uh four
sets of
uh five to ten reps or in the five to
ten rep rep range weight
two reps in reserve and then upright row
rows same idea two reps in reserved
direction reserve everything's to our r
because that's week one only
we'll get to how to modify it in the
next lecture
we're done we've got a program folks
that last
second to last slide right before the
slide that says done okay
that is a completed program it tells us
how to train
for one week notice it doesn't have any
loads in it but we'll fill in exact
loads
in the next lecture as examples the way
you fill in the load zone
is actually very straightforward if you
know the client's strength
they've filled out a sheet of their
let's say 10 rms you can just put in
loads that you think are in these rep
ranges the great thing is
these rep ranges are super wide so if
they say you know my best squad is 185
for 10
and you're trying to say what's a 5 to
10 uh
load two reps in reserve so that's
basically first set would be
you know eight reps or whatever uh
or sorry first set would be like their
12 rm potentially
it's the lightest weight you would use
and the heaviest would be
uh 7rm so you think okay well they gave
me 185 for their 10rm
sounds like 185 is our winner and you
just start with 185. and if you chose to
do 175 or 195
really not a big deal just all you need
is ballpark which is a great way
uh that hypertrophy training science
happened to have unfolded
is that the specific weights really
don't matter a ton as long as they're in
the general range and then how you
alter them from there is much more
important all right we're done we have a
program
and next up we have another in-depth
lecture
so tune in for that one when it comes
out and it's going to talk about now
that we have a program we're going to
use this exact program as a start
how we're going to modify it as the
clients execute the plan
that's that and we'll see you next time
for lecture 32.
you
