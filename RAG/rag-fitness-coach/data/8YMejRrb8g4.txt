hey folks
dr michael churchill here for
renaissance periodization rp university
rp
plus the last eighth lecture
of nutrition for muscle gain
myths and misconceptions and special
circumstances
in the quest for muscle gains let's get
into it special circumstances
are up first here's the deal
if you are an athlete and you want to
gain mass
in sport seasons in the context of sport
let's talk about what is good and when
is bad right
when you are in season first sport the
vast majority
of your training volume is going to be
sport specific
sport specific training volume means it
makes you good at your sport
but it's not idealized to put on muscle
hypertrophy training is
in in season you're probably doing the
least hypertrophy training you do all
here
and the least weight training probably
and you play the most of your sport
gaining mass during season is for that
reason not a great idea
off season is a good time to gain mass
as long as you have enough time to gain
the weight
stabilize your performance potentially
cut some fat maybe
and then enter the season so i sure as
heck wouldn't recommend a mass gain four
weeks before
season but 16 weeks before a season you
can go on a 12-week mass gain
for four weeks after kind of just resume
your more athletic endeavors
lower your training volume let that
muscle sort of
be a little bit more ingrained into the
performance side of things and then go
on and go forward
so the real thing about sports seasons
in season
not a good time to gain mass i've
fortunately been involved in collegiate
athletics a long time i've seen this
happen coaches will say you know such
basketball player
needs to gain weight and they're going
to be eating a ton of food
in season it's like man you know they're
gonna gain weight in season
first of all it's hard because they're
playing so much i'm practicing so much
but second of all if they do gain weight
because the weight training volume is
usually maintenance
at most um they're just gonna gain like
probably fat
and then it's just gonna slow down
remember when coaches say athletes need
to gain weight they almost always mean
muscle that's going to take months
of really good resistance training
hypertrophy rep ranges
and volumes and that's really only going
to happen in the offseason in a properly
designed program
so that's the deal there now
let's talk about some substandard
situations for muscle gain and maybe a
couple of tips as to how to get
the most out of them i was gonna say get
around them but there really is no
getting around them
first up uh folks that can't eat
remotely clean right they have access
maybe to only very high fat or very
unhealthy food
that's definitely a problem the good
news is is
here's how you navigate it you eat as
much carbohydrate
and as little fat and eat as healthy as
you can
and what you probably want to do to
minimize fat gains is to just lower your
rate of weight gain down to something a
little bit more manageable
so that if you do gain an excess amount
of fat versus muscle it's not an
absolute number high amount of fat but
if you were planning getting five pounds
of
muscle and five pounds of fat and you
end up gaining eight pounds of fat and
two pounds of muscle because the food
quality sucked
that's gonna suck eight pounds of fats a
lot but if you lower your weight gain to
a total of six pounds
you might gain a pound of muscle and
five pounds of fat well the muscle gain
pound
socks but at least you only gained you
know five pounds of fat and that's
pretty easy to get rid of easier than
eight
right so if you can't eat remotely clean
don't just go throw calories remember
anytime you can can't eat clean you can
still hit your calories which is number
one
and you can almost always get enough
protein after that you really just
uh have the more minute problem of
eating just not enough carbohydrates and
too many fats and also the quality of
the nutrients the food composition might
be of
lower value so that's not a terrible
problem
the worst thing to do in this candy
remotely clean thing is to just be like
well if i can't eat clean i'm just gonna
eat everything i can
eat tons of pizza and fries and all this
other stuff and all of a sudden you
balloon up to a really high body weight
that's not a really good idea because
what that's gonna do is just give you a
ton of fat and probably not much more
muscle
next up can't eat often
so you might be able to eat only three
meals per day right
first of all unless you're a
neurosurgeon
or james bond you can almost always
sneak food in
two easy ways almost all jobs
allow you a bathroom break during a
bathroom break
even if your boss says you can't eat or
drink at work
if you're female you have a purse if
you're male er
you're kind of fucked but you might find
a way around it
bring a bar or two bars
or a sandwich sandwiches don't hold
really well but bars definitely do
a shake into the bathroom
into the stall if you have to
drink the shake or some muscle milks or
eat the bar or whatever
all right i'm not familiar with almost
any job
in which people care if you if you poop
twice a day
right it's not gonna be like why are we
in the bathroom for five minutes
uh what the hell are we doing there that
takes so long maybe from the military
but then you know it's kind of like you
can gain mass at another time
and that's only just you know boot camp
most active duty you have much more
freedom
so in most jobs you know you can
disappear and go to the bathroom for
five minutes at a time most not all
and that means you can say you're
pooping or pump shit if you're really a
a plus mass gainer you can poop and eat
at the same time
i've never done that myself many times
you got to do what it takes so you can
sneak food in uh
and and that can definitely be a thing
if you can't
here's the deal keep your calories keep
your macros
just split into the number of meals you
can eat and remember you can always add
some meals
by eating in non-traditional times
people say well i can do breakfast lunch
and dinner that's three meals we can
always do a late night snack
that's four four meals is like you're
well within good range right
be creative don't break any outright
rules
try to make sure that it's an
inconvenience to yourself
potentially that might have to be the
price you still get enough food
so do you want to drag in protein bars
in your purse no
uh are you going to do what it takes
maybe that's up to you
but remember if it's just three meals a
day or something like that still try to
meet your calories and macros it's still
possible
what about playing another sport on top
of bodybuilding on tropical trying to
gain muscle let's say you do brazilian
jiu jitsu or wrestling or tennis or
something like that
that's definitely a thing it is
definitely a substandard situation
my recommendation would be choose a
phase of training or intentionally make
it so that you do as little of that
sport as possible
as much weight training as possible and
dedicate your mass gaining there
later on maintenance and on fat loss
phases you can definitely flip the
script and do more of the sport less
resistant training so on and so forth
but try to do it so that when you're
playing the sport less
or when you're mass gaining muscle
gaining you play the sport less
practice less so on and so forth it's
it's it's definitely tough
don't have magical thinking and think
you're going to be the greatest three
sport athlete of all time
you could be but the greatest three
sport athlete at all time is not the
greatest at any one of the sports by a
long margin so keep that in mind
i'm gonna have to pay the piper one way
or another another one is poor sleep
amounts
sleep seems to be with all available
research so far and there's getting to
be a bit
um incredibly incredibly important to
muscle gain
and very important to fat loss
chronically especially missing sleep
seems like almost a formula for
losing fat or sorry for losing muscle
and gaining fat at the same time
it's like real bad
if you're not getting enough sleep just
try to do your best and maybe take some
naps or something
if you're not satisfied with your fat
gains
slash muscle gains ratios after a month
or two of massing
you might consider maintaining until
your schedule improves and if it's
within your power to improve your
schedule
improve your schedule poor sleep amounts
are hugely detrimental these other
things you can kind of work around them
to some extent
poor sleep man there's really no work
around so
we just want you to know that um
potentially some of you watching this
are using this information for
yourselves
selfish bastards some of you are going
to be helping others some of your
personal trainers or coaches
for those of you both for yourself and
that are personal trainers and coaches
just kind of know that poor sleep amount
like i notice i didn't tell you a lot of
work arounds because there aren't any
so why is this information valuable am i
just telling you bad news is a joke well
no
um you're gonna have clients that let's
say you know you're a personal trainer
in new york city
and you got clients that are on wall
street and uh through a variety of
lifestyle choices
slash their jobs it's never just their
jobs they don't get much sleep
uh you know they enjoy partying they
enjoy drinks with friends clients
whatever
and they enjoy traveling and they also
you know it's like a rock star
wall street lifestyle right wolf of wall
street type of shit
and that's totally cool it's a great way
to live but some of them will come to
you in personal training and say listen
i'm dedicated i trade with you four days
a week
i want you to help me with a diet i want
you to maintain uh records and i want
you to help me gain muscle
if it becomes apparent to you upon
discussing their lifestyle
that they don't get much sleep this is a
come to jesus meeting conversation
you're going to have to have and say
look
we can give this like a college try and
have you gain
weight while not getting enough sleep
but i can reasonably assure you the
results will not be
if you get good results you could have
gotten amazing results if you hadn't
done the other one around
it's just a fact right
so um keep that in mind it's something
what i want you guys to get out of this
is not thinking like well so
my wall street clients they don't sleep
a whole lot but we're going to try to
gain muscle mass because it's not like a
huge deal
false it's a huge deal and they should
know that you don't want to like
charge someone for six months of mass
gaining programming and them end up
being barely gaining any muscle mass and
just getting super fat
whereas you could have just told them
look just don't even start this masking
unless you sort your sleep out and i say
okay great i'm gonna get so eight hours
a night
for the following six months i'm not
gonna go to ibiza i'm not gonna travel
for a bit let's just get this muscle
gain going if they on
board if they know the plan if they do
it they're going to get great results
they're going to recommend you to 10
other wall street guys and then you'll
be fucking loaded
right versus just ripping someone off
and just being like oh yeah i guess you
should have slept more like
no in advance it's your job to know in
advance it's not theirs because they
don't know the stuff they didn't go to
school for it
next one very related high stress right
it is possible to gain muscle on high
stress
more than low sleep but it's really
tough
so a lot of folks again you can sort of
warn them in advance like try
to stress as little as possible i'll
tell you this um
a lot of people can come to grips with
the mechanical sort of purely
physiological
limitations on muscle growth like they
know they don't need enough protein
you're like you should eat more protein
they're like i know
i know makes sense or you know they'll
catch themselves in the middle of the
day not having eaten they'll be like
i need to eat fucking masking they need
to eat or they're not going to get
enough sleep and they're going to get
more sleep they're like yes i know and
if they don't get enough sleep they'll
catch themselves and be like sleep
sleep sleep sleep i gotta get it stress
is one of those things that people
see as such a psychological thing they
disassociated entirely from having
physiological effects on their bodies
like you don't ever think like when
you're yelling at a client telling them
these you know q3 figures look like shit
you don't think of that as literally
hurting your muscle gains but it
literally is
so some people that just seem you know
you have clients or sometimes yourself
you're super fucking wound up they have
800 responsibilities 799 of which are
purely voluntary
um and they're just sort of strung out
in 50 different directions folks like
that sometimes need some advice and be
like look you got to cool the jets
uh calm down a little bit and and find
ways to de-stress and there's tons we
have the whole recovery book at rpe
if you're interested um and how to do
that and different kinds of stress
uh that's definitely a thing that comes
up because sometimes people are like
yeah i'm getting enough sleep and you're
like
okay like what's the rest of your life
like and they're like it's just go go go
go go all the time and it's like man
especially if you're emotionally
stressed remember emotional stress
is fight or flight it's sympathetic
nervous system boost in cortisol uh
lowering of testosterone you know it's
not it doesn't take a fucking rocket
science to figure out where that goes
uh and it's not in the direction of
muscle gain so high stress definitely
something to look out for
um here's a big one injury that prevents
hard training and people say like you
know like i can't uh
i can't use my hips but i want to gain a
bunch of muscle go jesus christ i can't
do squats can't do dad left can't do leg
press
like ma'am can't do bent rows it's gonna
be tough you have to give him a talk
about like well listen you know maybe
it's upper body only then we have to
gain really slow um
it's really tough in the in the fat loss
version of this
lecture which is a different lecture
series we're going to talk about people
trying to lose fat when they're so
injured that they can't train to keep
their muscle on
this is the same idea like a
prerequisite
of gaining mass is the ability to train
hard now if you train hard by working
around injuries or if you don't have any
major injuries
both are check marks but you got to have
at least one or the other so if
someone's like super injured and they're
like let's gain muscle you got to give
them the talk of like look
to gain muscle we have to move your
parts of your body to stimulate muscle
growth
and if we can't move half your body half
muscle growth is gone it's a big problem
let's do maintenance let's do a good job
of healing that injury once you come
back
ease in when you're at full strength or
close then we can start our
full mobility um without pain then we
can start to go and gain mass
i know it's crazy to have to mention
that but people try this stuff all the
time
all right last part myths and
misconceptions in muscle gain there are
so many
we could possibly have included all but
we included like 10 or so let's let's
get
let's get to these and sort of just a
real basics of why they're a bad idea
trying to stay infinity lean lean all
year round i just want to see my
crisp abs and veins i want to be seven
percent at all times well thing is
if you stay lean all the time you are
essentially saying to yourself i'm
not allowing myself to gain much or
pretty much any fat
most productive muscle gains in males
occur between 10 and 20 percent fat
and in females between oh if we're being
generous
15 to 25 but really it's more like 17 to
30 percent fat
if you have a female who won't go above
16 fat
she's almost sort of by rule definition
not allowing herself to gain muscle
it's like wanting to be a marathon
runner but telling yourself you never
run any longer than two miles
um there's not really a way to run those
two miles that hard that you'll get
ready for a marathon you can get
somewhere but you're sure as hell won't
get
marathon distance it's trying to stay
infinity lean
it's just a really really short-sighted
way of doing it 99 times out of 100 it
comes from some kind of body dysmorphia
where the folks are just so addicted to
being lean so scared of gaining any fat
because they think it's permanent or
they just hate it
that they won't let themselves get a
calculated level of body fat increase
it's just really fucking sad when that
happens
don't let it happen don't stay infinity
lean gain a measured
known predictable planned amount of body
fat
be okay with it for the short term you
can always get lean later and reveal the
muscle underneath
it's a two steps you know three steps
forward
one step back situation or in the case
of body fat
it's a two steps back three steps
forward situation
a lot of people just don't take any
steps back they'll never take those
steps forward
here's another one trying to mask for
too short a time which
nine times out of ten is for the same
reason as being infinity lean uh this
happens with female
uh clients a lot of times uh well
they'll say okay i wanna mass gain for
three weeks and that's that's it they're
like three weeks is not gonna accomplish
anything
right as we talked before that's below
our our shortest duration really
and uh nine times out of ten it's
because they're like well i'll just get
fat if i mask for longer the easiest
solution to that is
what they think is as massing uh or
muscle gaining
is is like you know at least like a
percent of body weight increase per week
but that's just the crazy high it's too
high
you know if they say okay there's no way
that you're going to get me to mass for
12 weeks you say okay
how about we gain like six pounds over
the course of those 12 weeks and they're
gonna be like that's not that much
i thought we're gonna gain 10 pounds in
three weeks it's like oh my god no
and when you like you say okay when six
is too much well let's gain four pounds
in 12 weeks they're like
all right but if i get too fat i'm
cutting it off you're like deal right
and they gain for 10 weeks and they
still feel great they're like ah let's
keep going and all
is well right so don't let people mass
for too short of a time the easiest way
you can explain it is like look we're
literally
you know we're just doing essentially
the uh foundational hypertrophy
uh and we're not even getting real
muscle gains which is preparatory
growth it's like inflating a tire and
then pulling the pump out to
let out just as much air as you let back
in like if you're gonna put the pump in
you gotta pump it a couple more times
extra so that when the air comes out at
the back end
there's just you know you're still
having net hypertrophy and within three
or four weeks of mass gaining that's
really not going to happen
right another myth and misconceptions
this is one that's not really so much of
a myth or misconception it's just a
shitty practice we have to talk about
a lack of consistent nutrition basics i
used to coach high school football
players and uh help them with muscle
gain
and they would brag to me about how big
a meal was that they ate and i was like
sweet what'd you eat the rest of the day
and they're like
not much and i'm like well that's why
you're not gaining weight would you eat
yesterday and they're like oh no it's a
real bad day
who cares if you can't consistently get
enough calories and protein especially
you're fucking done you're done so a lot
of times people
say like man i had route 2 you know this
is something you'll see out of
same the same wall street clients right
they'll say man i had a great monday
through friday i'm like okay how was
your weekend i
went to the club and
i didn't eat for must have been 36 hours
i just danced and well did you have fun
and they're like yeah
like did you gain any weight last week
no
all right and that's kind of like the
saddest situation of all not dancing for
three or six hours of club there's
nothing sad about that
what's sad isn't the people never put in
any effort
and also always do a mediocre effort and
then get mediocre or no results
it kind of likes you know makes sense
what's really awful is the people
that are on the money like three
four five six days out of the week and
then one two or three days out of the
week
they're so bad they're so off the rocker
that it cancels out everything
like it's possible to just demonstrate
with mathematical deficits
like if you over eat intentionally by
two or three hundred calories every day
you're on a great track
if you have one day on the weekend where
you under eat by 1500 calories which
people do all the fucking times just
disappear somewhere
um they just canceled out all that stuff
potentially like that's fucking awful
right so lack of consistent nutrition
basics is something that is a
non-starter
right if someone is bad with consistency
on nutritional basics and by that we
mean calories macros and just generally
decent number of healthy food meals
if they're not doing that man that's
what you gotta put all your attention to
as a coach and if you're not doing that
you better start doing it because you
get nowhere without consistency
right gaining too slow uh people get
freaked out again about getting fat so
they'll be like i'm gonna gain
0.1 percent of body weight per month and
then in 2045 when robots are taking over
i'll finally have gained five pounds of
muscle or some shit
don't go crazy stick with that range
0.25 to 0.5 percent
you'll be golden right gaining too fast
and getting too fat i've done that
numerous times
i've probably done that maybe 10 or 12
times uh
and it shits shitty every time right you
just get super fat super unhealthy for
no good reason and you have to work your
ass off getting rid of the fat it's dumb
don't do it um there's no rainbow at the
end
of that uh oh sorry there's no there's
no pot of gold at the end of that
rainbow
because you think man but at least i'm
gonna gain a ton of muscle
and you gain like like just a couple of
percent more muscle than you would have
if you just moderately increased your
body weight over time so that's really
uh
fruitless inappropriate training
stimulus
a really good example is people on power
lifting programs doing sets of two and
three trying to gain mass
it's just not going to cut it uh we had
a question at one
seminar that i did it was um this person
wanted to know if they could
gain muscle mass while running a
physique training program
and at the same time training for a
marathon we were all just
like no that is a real bad idea
why because how are you gonna gain
muscle in your legs if you use your legs
in the complete opposite pathway of
muscle gain well it's gonna be a real
uphill battle probably just all for not
so what's the solution there never gain
muscle or never train for marathon no
you're just doing both at separate times
take
six months baseline endurance capability
just to keep yourself in decent shape
tons of weight training gain muscle once
you've gained the muscle maintain it a
little bit
and then decrease your weight training
increase your cardio do your marathon
training you'll probably keep a great
majority of that muscle and then you can
restart the process but try them both at
the same time
is a real bad idea it's uh you know the
ultimate sort of incompatibility of
nutritional and training
uh a really good analogy for that is
you know how do you get the most work
done and make the most money at your job
you show up on time you do diligent hard
work you focus you take breaks when you
need them but
boom boom you're on task and then how do
you how do you become the most relaxed
and reduce the most stress
well you know really unplugging a cabin
in the woods with all your friends like
free
spirits and all that shit staring out in
the sky running around in circles
springing daisies on yourself um that's
great that's the best way to just relax
and let go
just you know throw the cell phone away
that whole deal um
what's the best way to do both at the
same time there is no good way to put is
that
like you know one is completely
incompatible with the other like how are
you gonna run around in the meadows
uh finding your inner child when you got
things to questions to answer on a
laptop
or you know charts and graphs to make
it's it's incompatible you just do one
do it well finish it submit it go on and
sprinkle daisies on yourself in the
meadow same way with appropriate
training stimuli if you've got some
other things going on you want to do
endurance work you want to do this you
want to do that powerlifting get it done
do it accomplish your results and then
dedicate yourself to the right kind of
training
during a muscle gain phase which is high
volume hypertrophy training not up for
debate
um another one is alternating between
goals uh
in the middle of the goal people will
start to gain weight and they'll be like
oh i'm cutting now and they'll cut
and then they'll gain it'll cut and
they'll gain and it sends really mixed
signals to your physiology and the
physiology just throws up two middle
fingers and tells you it's not doing
shit
i know a lot of people who sort of don't
know if they're masking or cutting and
it changes week to week and i know a lot
of those people who just don't go
anywhere
because the you can think about it this
way if they're masking cutting masking
cutting masks and cutting usually their
weight just stays right about the same
it's like they're maintaining except
with double the stress right so
pick which way you want to go go that
way for months
accomplish what you need to accomplish
and then go the other way it's almost
like
running around the meadow sprinkling
some flowers on yourself sitting down
answering a couple emails and running
around the meadow again
it's just again real real bad for both
because
again a lot of times the transitional
phases is what you end up doing
uh more than anything else it's just one
it's just recalibrating for the other as
soon as you've recalibrated you really
start to gain muscle
you start cutting as soon as you really
start to gain lose some fat instead of
just glycogen
you start massing and it just it just
goes nowhere right
um super super related is people who
plan this in advance and try to mass and
cut in the same week
this is like you know when you learn six
months of physiology and you fucking
have an einsteinian moment
and you're like okay if i gain for four
days of the week
but i lose for three days of the week
lean gains bro
that's it if i do that for 10 years i'm
gonna be fucking jacked and never get
fat
well the thing is again there are
systems in the body that takes days and
weeks to ramp up
muscle growth doesn't just occur uh
because of the day that you ate
something it occurs the second day third
day as well so for example
whatever body part you train on day four
if the next three days
are fat loss whatever body part you
train pretty much day three and day four
they're not going to grow much because
the protein you're supposed to be
supplying to their fsr curves
is is going to be eaten up by your body
processes and it's not only going to be
enough carbohydrates to stimulate
anabolism
optimally not enough calories to to get
the muscle growth done
so basically like you know if you train
legs on monday and you train arms on
thursday
your arms are just not going to gain
much size because you diet for the rest
of the three days after
and then actually because you're so
depleted after those three days
when you hit your leg workout yeah your
recovery from legs is going to be good
because you're eating for the next four
days but your initial workout could suck
because you're too
glycogen depleted and too fatigued it's
kind of the worst of all worlds again
mixing modalities is real real perilous
just focus on one general thing at a
time let it run its course
cut it when it needs to be cut and then
go to another one secret of life success
right now the slide i'm looking at is
pure darkness it says
end of slideshow click to exit much like
life itself
folks that is not a reason for concern
because there's
always more rpu and rp plus videos
coming your way
i will see you next time for tons of
them peace
you
