[Applause]
[Music]
okay this is the way
how we warm up that's it that's it folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
i'm here with maria fernanda who has a
full name hit it
maria fernanda garcia
amazing originally from mexico and now
she is living in las vegas and she is an
npc
bikini competitor and just a downright
savage person who wants blood has
punched a guy in the face before in the
gym just for fun
yes spots get out of my spot
here's the thing maria is
a bikini competitor and we're going to
do a back workout today
but because bikini competitors are small
and
fragile and need these exotic exercises
we're only going to do
super crazy isolation movements to
target really small muscles because
she's a fragile flower
and women shouldn't be lifting heavy
let's tune in for the first exercise
which is going to be a top secret you'll
see in a second
[Music]
so a really good thing to do between
sets is
dance a lot of times marie and i will
have twerking competitions
whenever the music sign on the gym on
that note first
exercise is the lat pull down we could
do pull-ups
but if you can do fewer than five good
strict pull-ups it's a lot
of times better to do assisted pull-ups
or pull-downs because that way you can
get
more volume and get more effort right so
we're gonna start with pull-downs
we're gonna do oh gee three or four sets
of ten to twenty reps
hard all the way to failure or very
close because this is going to be a
super super tough workout this is the
kind of workout you would do
at the end of your plan before deloading
so
let's hit it nine
slow good job let's get it let's get it
ten good technique
eleven two more gotta touch
[Music]
yep well one last one
go yes almost
and crack good job very good job
very good very good feel it back there
very good will we even have a dance for
it folks
when you can no longer touch your chest
with good technique
that's failure i'm having maria touch
down at the lower part of her chest
traditionally
pull downs would be touching at the
clavicle okay
but we're having her go lower because
touching lower if it's okay for your
shoulders
actually produces more lat involvement
which isn't a good thing or a bad thing
but since we're targeting the lats here
that actually is a pretty sweet way to
do it now you can try
you can touch your chest anywhere
between here like below the chest
all the way to here everything's fine
it's just different variations
sometimes i feel i have to see it sure
seeing your own chest is hard here's the
thing about training females especially
ones that aren't super gigantic
they recover super fast which means not
only can they have a higher frequency
workout
three or four back workouts per week but
they can also rest a short time between
sets
normally our sort of checklist for rest
is when you feel really strong
you don't have a burn in the muscle
you're ready to produce another good set
and you're not out of breath
she's probably going to hit that every
45 seconds or so we are not going to be
resting long so if you're trying this
workout
for a similar version at home by
yourself know that if you are
female and on the smaller side of things
you don't have to rest three to five
minutes like male power lifters do
more
[Music]
more let's go good technique
good more let's go
more you're doing great keep it up
[Applause]
beautiful again slow on the way up
slow good stretch
and again good touch gotta touch
you got one more for sure touch one more
again
let's go touch one more again
we're almost ready let's go yes and one
last one
only good technique no swinging make it
happen
again again again go
again stay up straight pull
all the way down yep and one last one
hit it yes and that's it
and wrap it beautiful very good
very good good stuff good stuff
all right that's it for pull downs next
up
barbell bent rows let's get it done
[Music]
barbell rows four sets of 10 to 20 reps
these are
tough as shit it's our first time doing
them with this technique the super
special deficit technique
this is probably how you should be bent
rowing that doesn't mean you need to use
the tens it doesn't mean you need to go
super low
but you need to go low enough that it's
a back exercise and not some kind of
bullshit hip exercise
every single time we touch the ground or
at least get fully extended
and every single time we touch the tummy
as soon as you can't touch the tummy
that's failure no bullshit swinging
let's get it done see
closer together uh yeah and then toes
out a little bit very good
grab the bar and then see how your back
is right now
exactly like that just take and just do
this
perfect one
two these are flawless three
no swinging four phenomenal media
perfect
five touch the tummy every time
six excellent
seven very good eight
come on nine beautiful keep going these
are awesome
ten good chest up back flat
good eleven let's get to fifteen
twelve no swinging
thirteen stretch
wow one more let's get it touch that
tummy
that's it one more one more one more
let's go
yes one more no swinging
that's it failure very good you also
have a slight problem that you have like
a negative stomach
so it's hard for you me i can touch easy
because i got this big-ass gut
can you turn to the side and pull in she
like i don't know
there's no waste there so every time i'm
like she's gonna touch her stomach
when you come up your stomach disappears
i'm like oh shit you have like two more
inches to go on my ass
big question is when does failure occur
in the bent row
because you can always schmidt a little
bit with the form you can always get a
little
creative and maybe do like just a little
bit of one of these
the answer is this the first time you
have to do a little schmidt
it happens sometimes we just like lose
our focus and you're like okay that
one's sucked try another rep
if on the second round you have to
commit yourself for that second rep
after you do a little weird twerk to
saying you know
no more only solid technique and then
if that rep doesn't go anywhere and you
have to schmidt
that's failure that's it because
sometimes
you get a little weird and then you're
like no no i can fix this and then you
still have reps and that's totally cool
that doesn't mean you have failure
but if you have to make twice the shit
is over what the hell is schmidt
who knows keep it going
it doesn't matter how many you get what
matters is they're all quality
good keep that chest up yes
yes
no hip swinging
[Music]
one more touch that chest
that's it good very good very good
good stuff relax for a sec oh i'm gonna
say something and then we'll we'll get
to dead left back
yeah yeah do you need a drink or
anything like that
[Music]
you're sick i'm trying to make drug
jokes you're making ball jokes we're not
even on the same page
more more you still got it you still got
it you want to put on muscle mass on
your back
this is how we're doing it today big
chest control
ah good more
ah go go good fix that technique
stay upright and up better
three more and you're done
one good slow
up fix that back before you pull
two and one last one gentle touch
and up up up up up three and slow
and that's it good job
yeah that was something good stuff
but you're too strong because that was
like 23 reps so we're gonna put more
weight on okay
if you can maintain neutral spine and go
all the way down
to a deficit great hypertrophy work for
the deadlift
maria got like 23 reps or something
insane
so now we're up to 165 because we need
to keep it down below 20 reps
to get the most amount of tension
metabolites are cool but deadlift's all
about tension
and anything more than 20 reps is kind
of just cardio all right so hopefully
this is enough weight if not we'll add
it again these are all work sets we're
not warming up
but sometimes you have to make
adjustments always good technique you're
going to notice her back is always flat
as soon as it rounds we call it out
if she fixes it we keep going if she
can't fix it the set is over that's
failure
up and then slow slow slow
and that's it very good
very good very good back pumped up
already righty
oh good more let's get this done right
let's finish on a high note very good
[Music]
up flat back
[Music]
slow up one more
last one of the day make it good gentle
touch
up up up up and then slow control as if
you're going to do another slow
slow slow slow slow that's it
[Music]
solid solid the high rep
sets of 10 to 20 in the deficit deadlift
if you have the cardio for it
is a fucking unbelievable back builder
glute builder and sometimes even
hamstring builder it'll all around get
you fucking jacked your traps will blow
up
your mid mid-back your spinal erectors
if you want that johnny jackson type
back thickness google if you don't know
who that is
high rep deadlifts an increasing load
over the weeks and months and years
is how you get super fucking jab fucking
great job
[Music]
we're trying to be serious
oh he didn't punch anybody i know yeah
yeah
let's find somebody that's the workout
we're gonna outro
and then stay tuned because there might
be a fistfight coming up
