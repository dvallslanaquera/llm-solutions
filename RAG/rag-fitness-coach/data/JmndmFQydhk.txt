drive up hard come on peace hard
extra means more growth ah
come on let's go Pete Drive hard
[Music]
hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization I'm sitting down because I
just trained legs I was on my way out
and uh Pete over here shows up and he
gets literally in my face and he's like
you're not leaving the gym
until you give me a chest and tricep
workout with a ton of tips and tricks or
like legit we're gonna have beef and
he's a big guy really I can stand up
and I was like oh you're gonna talk that
shit you want a chest workout my man
Dylan's gonna come through and he knows
all the tips and tricks also he's the
size of approximately two and a half
other lifters and we're gonna mess heat
up so much he's never gonna beg for that
shit ever again
you guys ready
ready yes sir one two three team
our first exercise is the cambered bar
bench press the bad news is you might
not have one of these around the good
news is the bar costs like 250 bucks so
you could easily harass your gym owner
into getting one for this lift we can
get the combination of the stability and
control of a barbell with the depth and
stretch of an actual dumbbell or push-up
or whatever machine variant that you'd
go below your chest this is the killer
it is probably in my view one of the
most stimulating chest exercises of them
all not for everyone but for most heat
here is going to be doing three or four
sets of 10 to 20 reps you could go
heavier five to ten is great he's coming
off of a little bit of a twinge in his
chest about five six weeks ago this is a
lift that exposes every fucking weakness
in your chest we don't want to play
around and go heavy he's going to do
High Reps you're also going to notice
that he is going to pause at the bottom
and milk living shit stretch for one
second each time you don't have to do
this but it can be an additive stimulus
let's get to training all right close to
failure okay okay
he's a big guy he can get it off okay
okay Dylan's like just lets it go okay
oh sorry
just do your best okay uh
okay thanks man it's an inclusive
environment
police Centric
boss up good come on
come on Pete
control control
pause
Monty you got this big test test run the
ceiling come on
[Music]
good
under control under control come on
I got you I got you one more under
control under control
come on push push push push
app failure
that's that's hard yeah that's hard
man says with blood in his face and eyes
I'm gonna wear my wrist wraps on the
next one sure if that was the only thing
I almost said yeah I noticed the bar was
kind of like yeah it was starting to
move yeah what's your best bench 474.
Pete has benched 474. and though he had
some injuries right now and I've known
him for a little bit his pecs are kind
of the biggest they've ever been yeah so
the muscle mass is there to be 474
strong 474 pounds no joke you betch 474.
absolutely not I sure should have it
you're gonna see how fucking humbling
the camber bar bench is especially that
deep camber especially that one second
pause drains the life out of your
pectoral muscles in exactly the way that
we want them to be drained and if you go
on your Google and you type in drained
but you don't type in packs you type in
other things and things down here
drained it's a fun search do it on your
parents computer and leave the tabs open
let's get to training
reach up
yes
a little bit longer pause
reach out to stretch
yes
stop
if you pause the next rep will feel
worse that's what we want we want it
green let it sink
good
look at that range no explosion on the
bottom he's out out of the bottom
he's out
yes one more one more last one
Big Stretch
he's out go go oh shit one more you got
another one you got another one
reach
reach
up
all right hard come on go go go go go go
lock it lock it
little wiggle never hurt anybody good
stuff man
good stuff
wow one more set and we'll be good here
yes you're the Pumped yeah for sure the
taking the extra time to like let it
sink because you think you're in the
bottom yes yeah you're getting like
really close to your chest dude I'm sure
if you did this enough times
you'd be touching your tests be a great
Mobility exercise for increasing your
100
so what these guys are saying is at the
bottom of the lift there's a tendency to
try to just stay there and hold it what
you want to do for muscle growth is
consider doing this when you get to the
bottom of the lift be it machines be it
dumbbells be it deficit push-ups be it
cambered bar and at the bottom for one
second instead of holding at the bottom
let your shit sink deeper that painful
extra stretch at the bottom is the
definition of stretch underload and if
your body has any chest shaped holes
it's gonna fuck you in them
yeah yeah that makes sense it's a good
idea sorry
I'll see myself
also from a range of motion increasing
range of motion versus perspective right
like if you're limited on range of
motion uh like say I mean in this in the
bench for example in his first couple
sets you know without the sinking he was
wasn't coming as deep he came down pause
sunk a little lower and now his
not active range of motion he's able to
come down lower right and putting
himself in an even more stretched
position with the same load and that
probably just means more muscle growth I
mean if you think about it your muscles
are stretching at the very most intense
load that they're gonna experience
there's just not a much theoretical
growth mechanism that's left over after
that good good good
the bar
good
that's what the bar
s think think
Center control eccentric
like the slow chest towards the bar
come on
push push push push push hard
[Music]
at work man that will fucking work dips
yeah all right yeah
[Music]
all right folks exercise number two for
Pete is going to be targeting the lower
part of the chest we did the camber bar
bench Target kind of the whole thing
probably see where this is going
and we are going to do dips now uh Pete
how much do you weigh
two five zero so he's probably not going
to need any extra weight on this
especially if it is done properly so
with dips what we want to do if we're
targeting the chest is a couple of
things
one is we want to grab a little bit
further here
if you grab close it's more triceps if
you grab further out it's more chest now
be careful not to grab too far out such
that your shoulders are feeling funky
still could be a little closer better
for the shoulders
when you grab at the bottom what you
want to do is have your chest point out
not cave in on it like this but have
your chest out and up super proud and
get your elbows to point as high to the
sky as possible you're essentially
opening your chest at the bottom and
always always always in this exercise
for chest pausing at the very bottom for
about one Split Second when you come up
all you have to do is get close to
lockout or right to it and come back
down do you have to lock out and rest
you can but even if you come up come up
to about here and start to come back
down you're going to come back down slow
expose in your chest the entire time
that is going to be a really really
rough thing we'll talk a little bit
about what to do with your legs want to
try a few do five dips with your feet
still on those things
yes heavy eccentric load and then push a
lot off with your legs
you can start just doing them but I
recommend warming up in at least a few
ways one if you can do like 30 dips by
yourself and you're pretty warm already
just do a set of five free dips then put
weight on or do your set of 30 or
whatever after a two or three minute
rest
another thing you consider is doing what
Pete's doing which is putting your feet
on the plates using your feet to help a
little bit on the eccentric and then a
lot on the concentric to get the dips
nice and warmed up elbows shoulders
everything get that pattern specifically
warmed up with the nervous system so
that you're doing really well for
yourself minimize the chance of injury
maximize the chance of good muscle
stimulation another thing is if you have
an assisted dip machine at your gym and
it's the thing that where you push the
plate away it turns into a free dip or
you have an assistant dip and a separate
free dip I would encourage you to do
that assistant dip warm-up is a great
idea what I want you guys not to do is
just to just get in and start doing dips
for some reason people love to do that
free weight exercises body weight
exercises they won't warm up they'll go
do pull-ups they warm up they will do
push-ups they won't warm up they'll go
do dips warming up is critical as Pete
weighs 250 pounds would you ever on rack
250 on the bench and just start going
fuck no you would warm up just the same
way you were with the dip so that's what
we're doing
[Music]
oh
that's big chest get open all right come
on
let's go
Patrol big chest big chest keep it open
drive good
oh monkey come on big chest big chest
keep it open
good come on
that's it that's good
chest big chest keep it open yeah good
stop good stop he said stop
it
a good cue to think about when you're
doing dips for the chest
is
instead of going down
try to pretend
oh
try to pretend that there's a button
that summons tons of hot degenerate
women with no moral values it'll just
come and slobber all over you and you
can only activate the button if you
press it with your chest but it happens
to be down and in front of you so what
you're doing is dipping and trying with
your chest to touch that button down in
front careful your shoulders might not
100 love that so only go as far as your
shoulders can allow but if you really
push your chest forward and really try
to touch that button you're gonna get
two things one a humongous chest
stimulus and two tons of absolutely
amoral
snake-eyed bitches to come grab up on
you which is exactly what you want
anyway don't care how many people they
just have to be good big chest
right right good
reach forward
yes yes reach reach reach big chest
drive drive drive come on
that's good stuff
fuck good stop feeling it
yeah the stretch more than anything good
that's what we're here for yeah oh sure
sure it's all gonna get fucked up yeah
like the stimulus is going to my pets
but I like back here I'm feeling it like
pulling oh yeah sure yeah that extra
extra yeah stand right here and I'll try
to kiss you
oh God that'd be a great thumbnail I'm
gonna throw up I'll be a great thumbnail
go down and try to make out with your
piece of spaghetti like the lady yes
[Music]
it's working
big test slow control
one more come on
I can see those packs working test open
up yes just like that drive hard come on
come on you got this
that's it beautiful good
stuff wow
it was passed out that was weird
damn yeah yeah
you know you're working or your blood
pressure is really high you're gonna die
soon nice yeah yeah 50 50. yeah all
right awesome stuff
dumbbell press wow okay yeah yeah fuck
yeah let's go yeah I'm gonna try the
trifecta
[Music]
so first cool thing is that the Dragon
Lair
in Las Vegas Nevada we're at right now
they have this amazing bench that
already inclines for you
who makes it looks like Arsenal Arsenal
Arsenal good one Arsenal bench helps you
arch your back for you and expose your
chest
if you're very very strong the following
advice will not work for you
Pete is really strong but this is the
third exercise so I feel like this will
work
what you want to ideally do is touch the
outsides the insides of these dumbbells
sorry to the outside of your pecs and
even your shoulders so the way I don't
want you to try to do this it's totally
fine way but everyone does it this way
is
to do this
oh yeah this is cool it's totally cool
what I want you guys to try to do we're
going to get pizza try to do
is to open up and go wide so that he can
go outside of his chest and actually
touch his front belts I would normally
be able to do this but this is enough
weight for your boy to be able to be
flexible like that that's right babe
but serious note chest up and wide out
one second pause up and in where your
elbows go is almost entirely up to
personal preference if you like of this
kind of shit that's totally cool if
you'd like to open your elbows out super
wide that's totally cool some people
like it better one way or another
whatever feels good for your shoulders
and gets your pecs that big ass stretch
that's probably the right answer
[Music]
success because
all right
come on stop control
[Music]
come on good keep going
higher level preferred
come on no rest at the top as soon as
you lock go down that chest up
oh God
[Music]
dude that was fucking sweet
next time as we finish the last one do a
full eccentric as if you're gonna do
another one and then rack okay it's
gonna suck okay but it's gonna be good
he's using 50 pounds this is a 474 pound
competition bench presser but we fucked
him up so much with a ton of full round
before and it's set number seven and
eight here it's gonna be really really
just 50 pounds is all he needs all right
we're not saying you're trying to lift
light that's not the whole point of this
lift as heavy as you can for the rep
range that you have targeted with the
best technique you can but when you
adjust for the rep range and when you
adjust for the technique be as heavy as
you can becomes not so overly impressive
but it does become an excellent way to
stimulate chest hypertrophy while
minimizing the effect negatively on the
joints it's wonderful wonderful
wonderful
come on
one more good wrap let's go big chest
Drive apart
[Music]
control come on let's get into the
stretch control
two full seconds
rack good
I like how you sort of tried to go up a
little after and you're like ah
lengthen partials JK that's right
[Music]
we're dating now oh wow okay keep elbows
tucked through your sides side as you
can up and back up and back yeah so like
a drag curl yes the drag curl equivalent
absolutely reverse these are reverse
drag curls I came up with that not you
and rap
okay so yeah
pull it back and then correct pushing
correct something that helps me a lot on
this is uh all kind of Bend forward a
little bit I'll keep the cable in line
and if I keep the cable in line with my
with my torso it pretty much will
guarantee that I'm that I'm keeping the
elbows up and back okay yes there's
nothing there's nothing at all wrong
with doing the push Downs like this
but if you want a shitload of stretch
under load you let the elbows come back
flush to your side and essentially in a
straight line it will fuck you up at
worst it's an awesome variation to try
at very worst Butterfly Effect style it
starts a Cascade of unpredictable events
that ends the world but like that's
unlikely I think
[Music]
two more
small
[Music]
wow yes yes
push
push
[Music]
it for nothing
rest for a second
fuck started at 100 and we're going to
80. I was gonna rest five to ten seconds
get a swag and then he's gonna go again
focus on the cues but it's just a little
longer
we're back
and those elbows in
come on come on
come on big chassis don't let the cave
is there for another kid bring it in
bring it in bring it in bring it in good
up and back up and back
[Music]
bring it in get in bring it in up and
back up and back up and back
[Music]
that's it
arm's looking big as shit do you ever
get like a sushi arm are you like mad at
it like it hurts and you get like anger
like Angry yeah I promise you off man
yeah
[Music]
hmm
you're a strong explosive guy Pete go
faster on the way down reduce some
fucking power yes and then slow
you messed up
speed
yes
[Music]
fuck with that speed door big chest
[Music]
yes
yes
go damn you as if another slow all the
way up slow chest up slow slow
fuck
let's stay at 60 for the next two sets
I'll explain on camera while you cue him
up heena's finishing up
we're no longer dropping we went from
100 to 80 to 60 we're not going to go to
50 40 Etc why because the load is now
outside of that it's less than his 30 RM
by long shot he's still longer heavy
enough to stimulate hypertrophy even if
we got metabolites cranking in there we
prefer to do sets of fewer reps maybe
even sets of five reps but each set of
five reps is heavy enough to be
stimulative so he's just going to do 60
and then 60 again so it's going to be a
hundred he did 80 he did succeeded now
it's two sets of 60 to finish off and
he's gonna be cooked and then push-ups
hit it
there you go
Ride Hard
as if another keep it close
come on keep it close keep it closer
there you go there you go big chest
that's it stop
fuck don't be fucking God
it's just another
last set coming up
they test me come on there you go
because keep it close
[Music]
keep it close keep it close tighter good
come on drive down hard
[Music]
big chest keep it close one more good
rep okay keep it closer keep it closer
come on drive down hard
yes good good as if another as if
another hosts
[Music]
good stuff right on the knees let's see
how many you can do normal grips and a
little close grip okay
I'm on beat come on Pete Drive
good one more good rep let's go come on
I got a couple
Drive hard
another one let's go let's go slow in
control chest up chest up chest up
drive up hard
one more piece keep going keep going
we're here for everything Pete
drive up hard hard one more keep going
we're here to take it keep going
[Music]
sorry about Park come on Pete hard
extra means more growth
come on let's go pee Drive hard
that's it
my man I love it
do you feel like you don't currently own
your arms
yeah they're just there it's just gone
fuck
oh wow
it was pumped
good stuff that was good that was really
good all right folks
Dylan what'd you think
great job honestly amazing yeah
he knows how to work what do you think
sorry Dylan what are we saying really
receptive to cues able to implement
things as we as we said them yeah
that's the most sight specific like the
most site specific pump I've ever gotten
Excellence yeah excellent and that leads
me to my point the last point is
quantity is awesome quantity is how you
periodize quantities how you progress
but the Baseline before quantity is
quality what you first want to do is
establish great technique from that
weight technique iteratively improved
over time you establish a great mind
muscle connection that mind muscle
connection with that technique allows
you to have an incredible stimulus for
every single rep and then you sequence
the Reps and sequence the sets and
sequence the weeks and the months and
the years finally you get gigantic and
then all of a sudden that girl would
never talk to you in high school you're
like yo baby what up and she's like oh
my God like your pet's like so bad
her mouth remains open for things you
can fill in the blanks for guys thank
you so much follow these two guys on
social media you'll learn a shitload
they're gonna be social medias right in
the description and actually in the
video itself and like subscribe and
comment bye and damn it I need more
Lamborghinis bye stuff see you next time
[Music]
thank you
