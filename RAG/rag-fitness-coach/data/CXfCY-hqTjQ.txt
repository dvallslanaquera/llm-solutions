hey folks dr mike here
charlie jung jared feather we're here at
ifbb
pro derek auslan's lex appeal
gym in tampa florida it's warm
it's sunny there are palm trees and
suffering
because we're gonna do our tuesday leg
workout we're gonna start with seated
leg curls
then we're gonna go into a lever squat
machine
that even has its own nickname because
it's hurt people before
and uh then we might do a few lunges
we'll see
let's get started
[Music]
hey folks we're starting out with seated
hamstring curls we're probably going to
do them some combination of straight
sets and mile reps
a lot of times we start with a straight
set and then the sets after that are
meyer upsets we do two or three little
rest breaks for two or three seconds
to get more effective reps and just a
way of doing things doesn't have to be
the way
you may ask why god's name we're
starting with an isolation movement and
we're starting with hamstrings
on a lower body day well the thing is a
lot of times
when we try to do hamstring second
after our main quad movement we're so
systemically fatigued
we can't really do hams any justice but
if we do hands first
it doesn't really interfere with our
primary quad movement at all
and we actually feel a little bit warmed
up and the hams are sort of
out of the way that's the rationale you
don't have to use it yourself give it
some thought
let's do some hamstring curls
[Applause]
[Music]
lyle's gonna have some shit to say about
that set you could have done 80 trillion
more
hey lyle mcdonald fuck you you know it's
sad
mike thinks he can train your failure
but he really can't
sad to see him literally
[Music]
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
hey folks lever squat time this
particular machine
is a little out of this world it's
leveraged real crazy
so we might get up to two plates on each
side on it
because that's how heavy the machine is
and you can put your feet exactly where
you want
ball or quad stretch at the bottom it's
tough to beat a really really good lever
squat like this
yeah fun times ahead yeah
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
ibb pro derek gosselin uh derek weapon x
auslan
and uh one of the owners of fam tampa
which you are in currently
so this is our pendulum squat um as you
can see
the guys had three plates on here um
i think the most i've ever done on this
thing is two and a quarter
aside three uh three plates it's funny
because i'll have people
you know new to the gym they know about
this piece of equipment because no
really no one else in tampa has it
and they'll come in and they'll think
that oh yeah i'm gonna
squat some heavy shit today i'm gonna
throw four plates on here five points
let's do it
and i won't say anything i'll just sit
at the front desk oh man and i'll just
watch them
and i'm like guys it's gonna be great
i'll get over people will come over and
as soon as they unrack it
all the way to the bottom this is not a
machine that you play around with
you start one plate aside get your reps
in
warm up add another plate to the other
side and incrementally increase until
you get to your working weight which
will probably not be
four plates aside it'll probably be like
two or one
charlie just did how many reps
22 reps with three points charlie's an
800 pound competition squatter
so chances are you're not doing that
shit i can't spend 800 pounds
[Music]
good damn
doing my last set here charlie goes
after as soon as i get off this machine
so last that third set go right into
lunges because the quads are
pre-exhausted
it can allow you to sum up more
metabolites the faster twitch motor
units
are fatigued they're closer to failure
so you sort of get more effective reps
out of lunges otherwise you'd have to
load the lunges a lot
it's a pretty safe way to do things not
the only way maybe you can give it a
shot on your own training
the bigger and stronger you are the
bigger your quads are the more lactate
they summate and the less they
release the better such supersets work
otherwise it's just junk volume
so if your endurance sucks like ours is
what i'm trying to say mean honestly
that's kind of rude right i'm trying to
do a talk here
to you guys our youtube crew and he's
fucking throwing up
uh some people just weren't raised right
so
i'm gonna do a set of 24 lunges as soon
as i got
get right off this machine why 24
because a week two weeks ago i did 20.
last week i did 22. this is 24. always
incremental progress deload repeat
let's get to it
let's go
yes
yeah come on
all right
oh
[Music]
charlie wendy's challenge

number one in the books
