hey guys dr mike israel here
for rpu rp plus etc
lecture number seven in muscle gain
nutrition
adjusting your timing food composition
and supplements as
you are gaining muscle mass we're going
to look at all three of these
throughout so first timing adjustments
what potential adjustments remember
in early lectures we've already laid out
what the basic timing should look like
what adjustments could we potentially
make to make our journey a bit smoother
and more effective
first you could eat earlier before
workouts
or eat less before workouts and more
other times of the day why
when you're mass gaining when you're
muscle gaining you are eating so much
food
that if you eat too soon before a
workout or too much food
you could get real sick and real vomity
and your performance could decline or
not even happen
and after you throw up squatting you
might not want to squat anymore
it's a really trippy thing for folks who
have dieted for fat loss attempting to
most of their uh fitness careers to even
consider this like how could this be
possible
if you didn't imagine eating two pizzas
and then trying to go squat i mean geez
that's a recipe for disaster
now that's not saying that's how you
diet but i mean if you wake up and have
breakfast that's 150 grams of carbs
15 grams of fat 50 grams of protein you
have a mid-morning meal at you know 11
a.m that's basically that size
she's just not gonna go at 12 to do your
workout because you're just gonna vomit
all over the place if you don't vomit
you'll just feel super stuffed and super
sick
so sometimes because you've added so
much food throughout the weeks of your
muscle gain phase
that you've got all this food built up
you might want to say you know i usually
eat at nine in the morning and train at
eleven
i'm gonna push it back to eight in the
morning and then it'll give me more time
to digest the food clear the gi tract
and i'll feel better it works every time
or you could lower the size of that meal
but remember you'd have to add those
calories somewhere back in
second one what you can start doing is
starting to take workout shakes if
you're not used to them or increasing
the size of your shakes
why because shakes are super easy way to
get more calories
you don't have to be hungry for them
that adjust rapidly so on and so forth
right after or during a workout listen
think about it this way if you can sip
gatorade and whey protein during your
workout that's calories you taken during
a workout which normally you would just
be missed opportunities miss time
to take in calories and if you sit nice
and slow it gives you some good workout
energy
hydrates you as well if you have the
right proportion of water and
potentially salt
and so it's all positives and no
downsides especially if it's not so much
fluid
or so much gatorade or so much
carbohydrate and protein
that it makes you sick during the
workout right so sip as you can as you
tolerate
you can increase a lot of calories just
through the workout shakes alone
hilariously if muscle gain gets really
far ahead and you really start to be
stuffing yourself
uh ironically you're reducing shake
sizes is something you might end up
doing
so when you start mass gaining you might
not have workout shakes halfway through
mass gaining you might get up to pretty
big workout shakes and then towards the
end
you start all of your other food starts
to get so high that you're never
clearing your jae char completely
when you start drinking your workout
shake pretty soon you're up full to the
brim again you have to squat you're
getting throwing up
or so you're getting vomity and that's
really not good so at some point when
you're really pushing your training very
hard with high volumes
and when you're sort of more out of
shape because you've put on a little bit
of mass and
a little bit of extra body fat towards
the end of a muscle gain phase
and when you're eating so much food that
even your shakes get squeezed you might
consider reducing shake sizes
a little bit more uh you know percentage
of water and a slow a lot lower
percentage of carbohydrate and protein
because if you had any higher
it would be too sweet too much food you
get thrown uh you know get to throwing
up and then that serves nobody any good
number four what you could potentially
do is add food volume to evening meals
because you literally can't eat big
meals
around your workouts if you eat if you
train with really high volumes right we
already talked about if you train with
high volumes you might not be able to
eat a lot of food before workouts
because you just throw up
but if you train with really high
volumes you get a bump of
sympathetic nervous system activity
right like you're just like disturbed
right you're aroused in the physical
sense
and uh your fight or flight and you
can't eat for a lot of food for the next
30 minutes even an hour after training
because you're that fight or flight
still from your workout uh in addition
to that you know your blood is in
your tissues or your legs or your
shoulders or something and it's not in
your gi tract so that again prevents you
from developing a lot of hunger
parasympathetic drive us down you might
not be able to eat much so what you end
up doing is you eat what you can
after the workout and then slowly as the
workout window leaves
and you start to feel better and better
you eat more and more and more which
potentially means
you eat more meals in the evening or
early morning depending on where you
train so that's definitely an option
again
these aren't things you do proactively
these aren't things you're like oh i'm
gaining a lot of weight should start
eating more in the evening absolutely
not
you try of course to eat most of your
carbohydrates or more of them
in the workout window it's going to be a
situation where like i can't do this
anymore and then it's okay to sprout it
out
number five you can add a middle of the
night shake this is real extreme stuff
real hard gainers folks that really need
to pound the calories i've done this
before
you basically can predictably especially
this is easy if you predictably wake up
to pee
at least once a night you wake up to pee
you walk to the fridge
you take a shake you fill it with your
urine
and you drink your urine i'm totally
kidding people have done that before
so what you do is you take a shake that
you pre-made it's a casing shake or whey
protein shake
you slam it you wash out the container
put it in the dryer rack
p go back to sleep that's it and that
gives you another bolus
of food i would recommend just protein
but potentially you could add carbs to
that down the line if you're really
desperate
uh and that gives you just more times to
eat right that's you're just eating kind
of all the time and sometimes that's
what it takes
uh people say well you never have to do
that well if for the last month you've
gained zero amount of weight and during
the day you've stuffed yourself with as
much food as you possibly could
yeah it's time to add a middle night
shake that's all i'm gonna say
next one is uh or the last one here of
timing adjustments
you can start to even out your weekly
intake
uh let's say you train five days a week
okay
sort of ideally by a small margin most
of your calories or more of your
calories should be on your training days
and
slightly fewer should be in your off
days just because it's not as much
energy demand
but then you think about it if you're
pushing you know you have two hours of
training on your five training days
before you can't eat a lot because
you'll throw up during you can't eat a
lot because you throw up
and after you can't eat a ton because
you're still sympathetic overdrive
so you use a limit to how much you can
eat on training days
some people say well i love training
days because i get to eat more like when
you're massing and you start getting
really big
you're like man training days are tough
for me to get enough food in
uh it's a really different problem so
what you might do is instead of
using your weekends for example let's
say saturday and sunday you have off
monday through friday you train super
hard instead of saturday sunday
lowering your carbs lowering your fats
lowering your intake to
you know have less food then because you
know you just don't need as much because
you're not active
that's when you eat more of your food so
you basically instead of having your
workout days be this much food and your
off days be this much your workout days
shrink because you can't eat that much
and your off days are basically the same
somebody could say
you could watch you pound a ton of rice
and chicken on a saturday morning
or something saturday afternoon lunch
with your friends and they're like whoa
you have a big workout coming up today
or you train early this morning you're
like nope
they're like oh you carb loading for
tomorrow like nope like what the hell
are you eating so much well because
otherwise i won't gain weight it's the
total calorie load per week that matters
from weight gain the most
and you got to fuel the machine because
if you can't fuel it on the
uh you know days you train enough to
gain the weight at the rate you need
you're gonna have to fuel it just when
you can myself personally
currently i train jiu jitsu on uh you
know four days a week usually and i
train bodybuilding sometimes with two a
days
for sure six days a week so i get one
toll rest day
am i eating less on that rest day no way
i'm just trying to recover from
everything else i'm doing my rest day
has at least as much food as every other
day
so you know if you're training a ton and
you have trouble gaining weight
you know you can really forget to a
considerable extent that eating less on
non-training days it goes out the window
all right food composition adjustments
how are we going to treat those
as we gain weight what can we do with
the content of our food the actual food
choices
to make sure the process is more smooth
one is as we mentioned before
increasing the use of shakes right
especially with whey protein
to reduce whole food protein intake and
make it easier to get all the food
right if you eating 250 grams of protein
per day
and all of that has to come from meat
your teeth are going to fall out of your
mouth you're going to chew so damn much
and all the carbs and all the fats it's
just burdensome to eat that much food
if you take two way shakes you know each
of you know 40 grams or something like
that
that's way less actual meat or vegan
protein that you have to eat
uh you know if you're you're vegan you
wouldn't be waste shakes that would be
you know some other kind of shakes uh
maybe soy protein shakes pound those
shakes and then it's uh that much easier
to get in your daily protein and let's
be honest
daily protein when you're not hungry is
the hardest thing to pound in
you can pound in some carbs and fats
they're pretty tasty protein is just a
chore
so just using protein shake can make it
easier to get all the food
and and you can even do meal replacement
shakes and we'll talk about some of
those
in just a bit another one switching from
casein protein at night
right for your last meal to away at
night you think about what are you
talking about ways fast digesting the
night
is long we need fast adjusting slow so
we need slow digesting because casein
you know
is slow and it really just takes care of
us the rest of the night we'll check
this out
if you're so backed up on your digestion
that by the time you get to your casein
shake at 10 pm before you go to bed
that you're up to the brim literally
with food
if you take away shake and drink it it's
gonna take like six hours
for that way to even start digesting
because it's got like three of the last
meals that you ate backed up all the way
up before that
so you you know casein is the benefit of
casein on a diet is that it's like a lot
especially casein pudding it's like a
lot of sludge it really fills you up it
sits in your stomach
that's nothing we want on a masking
which we're really pushing things
whey goes down super smooth it's super
easy easy to digest pound the weigh
shake or any any faster digesting
protein than casein
because you're already you have no
trouble whatsoever
keeping nutrients around the clock
because you're so backed up right
i don't know if you guys have ever had
experience if you eat so much food in
one day
that you wake up the next day not hungry
and you're like oh
you're still burping up food from
yesterday you're like my god i've been
digesting that all night like that
definitely happens and if that's
happening i would recommend switching it
away at night
instead of casein your your whole eight
hour digestion is
just patented it's built in already to
the system because you have to digest
seven hours of steak and then one hour
of weight or something
next one this is one that is a sort of a
cautionary
approach here remember you still want to
eat as healthy as you can
but fundamentally gaining muscle mass
gaining weight
unless you're underweight to begin with
much of you're not it's a trade-off for
performance and health to some extent
it's not the healthiest thing in the
world to be over feeding yourself
sometimes when you eat enough food you
cannot eat veggies fruits and whole
grains in the amounts you used to
because you'll literally just
shit yourself to death or maybe not
literally figuratively shit yourself to
death and you poop eight times a day
you just get over it real quick or you
get to levels of fiber that are
sustainable or just becomes impossible
to eat that much food because remember
veggies fruits and whole grains in that
order are very hunger suppressive
men like you know you could say you know
about a 600 gram of carbohydrate diet
and if someone says we eat mostly
veggies fruits and whole grains right if
you tell them yes they'll be like how
the hell do you eat that many and you're
like well no
hold on it's not all uh veggies fruits
and whole grains and listen if anyone
wants to take the challenge if this is
just a joke don't don't really take it
go ahead and try to eat 800 grams of
carbs a day with mostly veggies fruits
and whole grains
and i don't mean just almost all whole
grains and just a little bit of veggies
and fruits are cheating
you know a third veggies the third
fruits and third whole grains i mean
good god i mean that's going to take you
to like 150 grams of fiber per day where
50 is plenty for most people
it's going to be a disaster right you're
just not going to be able to sustain the
effort and if you do sustain the effort
it's going to cause you gi
problems so at some point you might want
to just you know
have a certain amount of fruits veggies
and whole grains that you eat that you
carry over from your fat loss days
and as you add food when you're already
nice and
not hungry just add it from more
processed sources
you know white rice potatoes pasta
instead of really whole grainy kind of
earthy stuff
might be better for your digestion might
be easier to take in so on and so forth
and on that note eating more processed
grains is totally fine on a masking
phase
if you need to again if your hunger is
good i would just eat the healthy stuff
more often but if you're really having
trouble stuffing it in
eating more rice cream of wheat that
kind of stuff i mean
yeah it doesn't compare to fruits and
veggies and whole grains but
it's very healthy still and you've got
to do it if you're going to get in that
number of calories
another one really sort of i don't know
if it's counterintuitive
but most people think like you know oils
don't taste all that
great nuts are amazing tastes amazing
you eat like you know
18 handfuls of nuts when i'm in a fat
loss diet the thing is when you're on a
muscle gain diet things get really weird
especially when you get not hungry
eating nuts when you're not hungry is it
really gets tough like the almonds
every part of your mouth seems to be
filled with them at the same time you
take these gulps of dry almond
you know chew and you're like oh my god
i'm gonna choke to death in these things
and look at it you're like this is crazy
why am i doing this it gets
tough right oils here's the thing about
oils if you're
adding fats with oils you just like have
chicken and rice you pour in
some oil and maybe some some soy sauce
it actually makes the meal
easier to eat right because it's not dry
and
you just you got in 30 or 40 extra
calories or 100 extra calories just by
sprinkling some oil on there
versus having a shove you know nuts down
and choke on them shits
it just gets annoying don't take my word
for it
try a real aggressive mass phase or try
getting real big and eventually eating a
lot of food
and and eating lots and lots of like
handfuls of nuts
man it just it gets to be a bit much
just chewing on almonds after a while
it's like
forget this so oils can make things
easier
no problem and here's sort of maybe not
the worst news
here's the last shocker even nut butter
can be a bit much
when you've gained enough weight and you
still have to gain more if you're really
stuffing yourself
oils have this magical quality
especially like um
olive oil or canola oil that are lightly
flavored
um you can't tell when they're in your
food or you can barely tell and if you
can tell it makes food creamier and
tastier and go down easier it actually
makes it more palatable
right um nut butter
at that point when you're super over
full
i don't know if any of you guys have
ever run into this
like you look at a spoon of peanut
butter and you're like that's gonna take
me
an hour to swallow because you put the
peanut butter in your mouth
and it instantly coats every conceivable
surface area of your mouth and sticks to
the roof of your mouth and you're like
you try to swallow it it's just terrible
even you know you're over massing or
really pushing it
when peanut butter is too sweet for you
to even eat you're like this is oh my
god it's like it's like i'm eating
nutella or something like that or like
it's crazy talk on a fat loss diet if
you're watching this on a fat loss diet
by the way i'm really sorry
on a fat loss diet you're like eating
peanut butter and you're like i could
legitimately eat like five jars of this
no one could stop me
at a masking phase we used to have a
thing where we'd say like your mass
phase
is really kicking into high gear when
you actively refuse peanut butter
if you know that's happening no big deal
switch to oils because some people think
like okay
if i can't eat peanut butter anymore i'm
just
there's no way i can add calories
because i love peanut butter and there's
no other easier way there is
adding oils putting them in food great
way to add calories
uh but is is way more sustainable in the
long run
not as tasty but at that point things
that are tasty actually sort of actively
avoided those are
too sweet too filling what about
supplement adjustments
the biggest recommendation i can make is
for mass gainer shakes
if you choose to have mass gain or
shakes the number one thing you have to
remember is
um to quote to quote goku from dragon
ball z
and a super saiyan transformation the
transformation has to come from a need
not a desire okay lame is that analogy
is this the same thing for mass gainer
shakes
you don't have the shake because you
want to shake and
you think it's going to have some kind
of magical properties and
somehow it's going to make you jacked
it's got no magic at all it just has
carbs proteins
and fats it's just calories right but if
you
need the shake then you need the shake
which means if you're already eating
tons of whole food and you can't stuff
any more whole food in like you're just
over it short of resorting to junk food
you might choose a mass gain or shake
and here's what the mascara shake should
look like
it should have high carbs and low fats
so an example
i'm not paid by optimum nutrition to say
this no
professional or personal association
with that company they just make damn
good shit
optimum nutrition serious mass
has in one serving which is two giant
shakers by the way something they don't
tell you it's a lot
50 grams of protein 250 grams of carbs
and only 5 grams of fat
and those carbs by the way are
maltodextrins so they break up into
glucose super quickly
amazing and you can jam at least half of
that
down no problem and not even notice it's
great in a parry workout window so the
way
you can have these shakes is usually
you'd have your post-workout meal of
like cereal or something like that and
just keep you stuffed for hours and you
barely get your chicken and rice later
forget that cereal meal have a mass
gainer shake instead and within like 40
minutes or something you'll be pretty
empty feeling again and you'll be ready
to eat it's a super fast way
of getting in tons of calories right
if you go to another round and you don't
buy the optimum shakes your shake
whatever one you buy or you make has to
be very easy to get down like if it's
tough to get down
why are you eating it people make these
mascara shakes with ice cream and stuff
like that and they're like it takes them
an hour to drink the thing like let's
just have a meal at that point right
the higher glycemic index it can be the
better because not only is it easy to
get down then but it goes through super
quick it gets absorbed super quick and
you're ready to eat your next meal again
super quick
optimum uh serious mass shakes
holy crap if you're like normal in you
know if you're not super stuffed from a
meal before post-workout
you have that shake you had better have
food around within an hour lots of carbs
because otherwise you go rebound
hypoglycemic that's how glycemic that
shake is
amazing right best taken post-training
we already mentioned that
uh you can take it potentially pre and
post
a little secret for you guys when i was
massing recently and i had 900 grams of
carbs per day here's how i got the edge
i don't recommend that you ever start
with this it's something again that has
to come from a need not a desire
i woke up and i would have one optimum
nutrition
serious mass shake 250 grams of carbs
in my workout two hours later i had
100 grams of carbs from gatorade and 40
from protein
after post-workout meal was another
serious mass shake of 250 grams of carbs
for those of you keeping count at home
that is 600 grams of carbs
in the workout window and that's a total
time of like
five hours then all i need to do is eat
300 grams of carbs for whole food which
took fucking heaven and earth by the way
to do
and i had the rest of the day to do it i
had like eight hours or something like
that
you know even even then it was tough but
look could i have eat 900 grams of carbs
just whole food
no way not possible for me not possible
other people might be able to do it
so potentially you can take it pre and
post clearly not right pre
if you take 250 grams right before your
workout it's just going to come out
the same way it came in right it's
helped me in dire times
big time i would highly recommend an ah
one of these shakes
people say like i've literally heard
people say i eat food and there's no way
i can gain weight
with optimum nutrition serious mass
shakes or a comparable
product you'll gain weight you fucking
will
unless you got your 0.01 percent of the
population because i've got a miraculous
metabolism
then just enjoy being lean the rest of
your life
last consideration on supplement
adjustments
if you are a big pre-workout fan and
especially if you're a pre-workout fan
and you're a coffee drinker
or monster drinker or tea drinker or
caffeine user
you can get into situations where you
end up using the normal amount of
stimulants or even more stimulus to help
you train hard on a muscle gain phase
and what that ends up doing is it's just
an inhibitor on your appetite
so i think when i consult people um
when they say hey listen if i can't get
all this food down one of the questions
i ask is like do you drink coffee or tea
or something
like oh yeah like three monsters a day
like well you know that suppresses
appetite some people don't even know
that
well caffeine's precipitate like yes i
say you know if you can
tolerate it just try to cut down your
caffeine intake and replace it with food
they do that and they end up gaining
weight because they get some hunger back
and everything goes well so
just consider your stimulant dosage and
when hunger
is a real big problem when you're really
trying like just really struggling to
stuff food down give some thought to
potentially reducing your stimulant
intake
and it might help all right
that's it for this lecture next up
misconceptions
special circumstances in muscle gain the
last lecture of the series coming up
thanks for tuning in folks and i'll see
you next time
