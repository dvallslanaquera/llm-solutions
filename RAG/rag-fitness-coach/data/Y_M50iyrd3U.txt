hey folks it's me dr mike kital for
renaissance periodization welcome back
to the targeting the muscle series
today we're going to do squats and i'm
going to talk about how to get the most
out of your quads when squatting just a
couple tips here and there to get you
guys good and proper we are going to be
using
the transformer bar
from kabuki strength chris duffin's
company it's a sweet bar and it's super
comfortable
you don't have to use it but if you've
got it around it's really fun let's get
to the tips
[Music]
all right folks first tip
is to break
at the hips and knees at the same time
or even break at the hips a little
sooner so breaking at the hips first
looks like this we tilt back at the hips
and then we go down breaking the hips
and knees at the same time looks like
this
breaking hips and knees what you don't
want to do with the squat is break at
the knees first and then the hips that
tends to cause some knee discomfort and
it'll put your center of gravity a
little bit forward reducing stability
not ideal so when you're starting the
squat hips and knees at the same time is
generally best if you have trouble with
some hip stability break at the hips
first then the knees and then go down
that's probably a good idea to set the
squat up to be super quad dominant but
there's so much more to say
let's say it in just a sec
next tip is to make sure you have your
feet positioned
such that you can produce tons of force
have force transmission through your
entire foot that means heels all the way
to toes and be very comfortable with how
your knees and hips are aligned for
example if i take a very close position
point my feet forward if i try to squat
down it feels really weird i'm binding
up all in myself feels strange i can't
produce a lot of force i can't hit good
depth i can't get the quads to be loaded
under a stretch no bueno at the same
time if i take a super wide stance point
my toes way the fuck out i feel mostly
my adductors and glutes being trained
not a ton with my quads something in
between is usually good and here's the
part where you practice for yourself so
for me slightly around shoulder width
stance
toes pointed for life build pretty far
out but like 45 degree angle and then
when you dip back and squat deep
everything is aligned super well you can
stay nice and upright and really feel it
in your quads my knees feel great my
hips feel great everything is perfect
it's going to take you a little while to
feel out where it's best but what i'm
telling you here is it's worth feeling
out because once you get your good
position you can just keep doing it and
getting awesome gains
[Music]
all right folks if your goal in the
squat
is to lift as much weight as humanly
possible
we do like the power lifters do we sit
down and very far back allowing us to
leverage our very strong glutes allowing
us not to have too much a degree of knee
flexion because your strength in the
quadriceps and the knees is often not as
strong as it is through the hips so that
squat is going to look like this you're
going to keep nice and tight but notice
i'm sitting far back and then i'm coming
back down my knees don't go very far
over my toes maybe not at all it's great
for lifting a lot of weight and if
you're a power lifter that's how you
should be squatting however
if you are trying to target the quads as
much as possible
after you break at the hips
assuming your heels are still on the
ground you want to shoot your knees
gently forward over the course of the
descent
as much as possible because having your
knee shoot far forward means the degree
of knee flexion and thus the stretch of
the quads under load is maximum and
that's how you get really good results
so i'll do the power of your squat again
just so you guys can see okay that looks
fine
but the bodybuilding squat we squat back
and then down and knees go forward
notice how far my knees are over my toes
my degree of knee flexion here
is really high versus here we're here
i'm staying nice and upright and the
quads are really getting smashed
which is the whole point
[Music]
as you descend in the squat and
especially as you come up
we want maximum quad engagement one of
the ways we do this is by staying as
upright as possible
if you start to bow over and dip a lot
of the strength of the squat comes from
the glutes the adductors and even the
lower back that's all fine and good if
you want to squat a lot of weight but
it's not super ideal if we want quads to
be the limiting factor
so one big cue is to have your chest up
especially at the bottom of the movement
having a chest up here is easy
having your chest up at the bottom is
hard so if we take a nice dip into the
bottom of the squat
yes it's okay for us to be here
but we really want to be here chest
upright at the bottom notice if i do
this
i sag backwards and i can actually not
stretch my quads as much if i'm upright
my quads are really taking the load and
if i'm ascending with an upright chest
it's really just limited by my leg
strength which is exactly what we want
if i round a bit i can still get the
weight using my back that's not the
purpose so
as you descend into the bottom of the
squat think chest up just up just up
just up pause drive up with your chest
no it won't let you lift as much weight
but it will hit your quads like the damn
well supposed to be hit
foot situation we already talked about
having the feet angled at the right
width and making sure you're in the
right stance to get a really really good
connection with the ground and feel your
hips and knees and the whole body in
proper alignment however let's talk
about
where the force is and where your body
is
front to back on your feet
if
we sit back
and we're so far back we're not on our
toes just on our heels
what that does as you can tell
is it actually pushes us back and
reduces the amount of quad utilization
the amount of stretch the amount our
quads are going forward so for back here
that's not ideal for the quads if we're
so far in front
that we're only on our toes we are super
unstable and we are unable to generate a
ton of force and a lot of the biggest
strongest parts of our quads the motor
units simply won't turn on and won't get
you any good growth this is why sissy
squats are a fine exercise but maybe not
the best exercise ever for the quads so
what you want is to be producing force
through your heel through your toes and
everything in between for a nice strong
posture that's how to get it done
final tip if you're doing all the stuff
and it's all working really well
but you still could use a little bit
more connection and mind muscle
connection with your quads
one thing you can really do to help
yourself out
it's gonna be humbling as far as weight
on the bar notice i'm not doing anything
here
a slow eccentric
and a full one or two second pause at
the bottom
during that pause you're going to
connect with your quads make sure you're
aligned properly and have time to get
your brain to think pushing through the
quads on the way up so instead of
squatting at a normal pace like you
might i mean this works super well
if you're having trouble connecting with
your quads we can do better so you can
take a slow eccentric
really thinking about your quads
activating and your knees pushing
forward
one
two
up
down slow and controlled
one
two
up just like that
are you going to be able to lift a lot
of weight no are you going to have time
to really focus on your quads
yes and that's the whole damn point of
the game
folks thanks for tuning in we'll see you
next time for another exercise
[Music]
