holy fucking shit now like full stretch
pull-ups with a little athleticism
coming up over the bar with the chin at
fucking 400 plus pounds is impressive
like a real talk kirakos Grizzlies lifts
are insane and weird and probably not
very effective for the amount of fatigue
they generate and excessively laborious
to set up the gym situation to have them
done he's big and strong and athletic
and it's a trip like God damn it you're
not supposed to be able to move 400
fucking like that why don't you go to
Walmart next time pick someone out who
weighs 400 should be easy and be like
hey how many pull-ups can you do they're
going to be like ah yeah come on man
that's not nice cuos he's your man
