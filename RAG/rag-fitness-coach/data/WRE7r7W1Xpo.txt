hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization breaking through strength
plateaus video number six
recalibrating
relative effort boy i go out of my way
to make these sounds so fancy and
sciencey and i just yell at you to do
better
relative effort spectrum
anything at rp6 or so
is pretty easy
and it's probably not very stimulative
strength gains in non-beginners sure
grandma can get strong during rp6 i hope
you're not grandma any grandma's
watching this what's up ladies um take
no offense
on the other end of the spectrum is rp10
it's the gun to the head mentality super
stimulative but very
unsustainably fatiguing which means you
can't pull it off multiple weeks in a
row
there are two types generally of
plateaus that occur because
of a problem with relative effort
the first type is you're training at an
average of rp6 or less
you think you're training hard but you
are wrong
and you're not making any gains because
it's too easy
the second type is you're training it
like rp 9 or often 10
every time you hit the gym
you're getting super fatigued you fail
to match performance the next week
you're ultra beat up you have to deload
somehow switch some things up try again
you're just like a butterfly flying into
the sun and the winds are doing this and
that and nothing's happening you're not
making any more gains
mostly because you can't build a kind of
training momentum that you can add a few
pounds here add a few pounds here add a
few pounds here and then you're getting
really strong you add a few pounds and
then you shit the bed then you add them
back and you shit the bed because it's
just too hard to be sustainable
now no matter which one of these
problems you suffer from if you suffer
from that's why you have a plateau
there is a simple solution to that
first point how many points we have here
six
we're simple but there's six points
jesus
like if i'm assembling furniture if
there's more than one instruction i just
burn the fucking thing and do it by hand
but in any case
point number one
start it what you think
is a six or seven rp pick a load
and number of reps that's a six or seven
rp okay
if you're training too easy that might
be an actual floor rpe don't worry about
it that'll be fixed later it's not a bad
thing
if you're training too hard or if you
think you're training too hard really
really back off
really make sure it's actually six or
seven just cut a ton of load off the bar
then cap your reps in like sets of five
or something so that it's just not that
challenging don't you worry
that's not a problem
point number two is the real big
operative point
every single week for the next whole
mesocycle of training for eight weeks
you add like five pounds to the bar okay
it should be an amount that you think is
reasonable i would just say five for
most cases not to each side to the bar
total add five pounds every single week
and it doesn't matter what rpe it is you
just start at your best guess of six or
seven and you just add five add five at
five out of five that's it
every week
doesn't matter what rp it is do the same
reps just add five pounds so you're
doing three sets of five it's 100 pounds
105 110 115 etc just keep
going at some point
this training went really really really
really hard
get a good fucking spotter
not up and get those reps anyway get it
done
match those reps fives like you fucking
promised yourself or fours or sixes or
whatever up range you pick between three
and six
stick to that shit and get those reps
with the increased weight that's five
pounds more than last week
now point number four is that at some
point
you will fail to match your reps instead
of hitting a set of five you'll hit a
set of three or four and then the next
session you'll do that again two
sessions in a row
despite unleashing your fucking demons
on the shit and really really trying
your best you'll still fail to actually
meet the performance that you're
supposed to get
then you take a deload week
really get rid of the fatigue
and restart the process
somewhere midway between where you
started with load and where you hit the
shit hit the fan and you couldn't go any
further so for example if you started
last time at 200 pounds and you got the
same wraps let's say it was really easy
and you got the same reps all the way up
to where you failed at 230 start the
next mesocycle at like same
number of uh wraps
at 215 pounds and then repeat this
entire one through five step process
again until you burn in the sun and can
no longer do the wraps that you're
supposed to
same thing adding five pounds every
single time
so what does this actually fix
if your problem was that you were not
going hard enough
you'll either get stronger forever okay
you just keep adding you know five
pounds until you're lifting like 900
pounds versus the five and someone tells
you that's the greatest bench press it's
ever been done you're like oh sweet i
guess i have super powers
or more likely you'll hit the wall and
actually really do an rp 10 trying
bleeding out of your fucking eyes trying
to do that shit
cool thing is you'll get stronger the
entire time because most of that time
was spent because you started at six ish
and ended a tennis by definition most
time was spent probably in the seven to
nine rp range which is productive and
actually great training and another
benefit is when you do hit rp 10 for
real for real because you're challenging
yourself you'll kind of know what that
really feels like and you kind of feel
like man you know typically people don't
go three months straight
adding load from rp six to ten maybe my
six was not so great of a guess and
because you restart the process midway
through you actually obviate that
problem altogether awesome
if your problem is going too hard up
front
you by starting way nice and easy will
have started in such a way that gives
you a big buffer it's unlikely you'll
hit the shit right away
god damn it only add five pounds each
time don't be looking feel good today i
had 25. where are you going nowhere the
addition of the load as long as it's
challenging is what is
sort of fueling that strength progress
you're golden you don't need to add 25
pounds each time
it takes weeks to work up to ultra hard
which means that training that you have
just done has been in that 7 to 9 rp
range seven eight or nine and it's been
super productive
also now for next time
you know that like you had you started
what you thought was real light and you
had six unreal productive weeks of
training you gained strength that entire
time you hit new pr's in the week number
six you look back and go damn that was a
really great cycle
i should start a little lower next time
instead of you know like i i went from
200 230 this time i was going to just
start at 2 35 next time which some
people do
i'll just start at maybe 215 or 220 and
then you've got another multiple weeks
of that really sort of moderate rpe 789
that's where all the good stuff happens
that's hopefully the lesson that you've
learned out of that shit
now there are some must-dos with this
you must do at least two things
actually push yourself do or die
mentality to match last week's reps this
week with five more pounds no matter
what
and you only accept defeat if your
technique breaks down and or you
physically can't fucking move the bar
anymore and you're really trying feel
free to yell
shitting yourself as an option a
combination always gets the attention of
all the ladies in the gym
you got to do what it takes and if you
get shout out once come back the next
session monday doesn't go well come back
thursday because it could have been an
off session one bad session means
precisely dick you gotta go in again and
redeem yourself and if you fail to
redeem yourself
then hey it's deload time and you did
all you could right
point two and this is for the extra hard
training people
actually start out at a lower rpe at the
beginning of this not fucking nine or
ten
just kidding start our p10
show us all how tough you are and stay
weak forever
i've been dr mike i'll see you next week
for the next video in the series
you
