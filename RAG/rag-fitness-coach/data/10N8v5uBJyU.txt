you do not have to do specialization
routines and as a matter of fact if you
want all around to be as jacked as
possible do not do specialization
routines cuz you could have recovered if
someone's like yeah man really focusing
on hams and and glutes this mle cycle
you're like okay so quads are't
maintenance yep quads are maintenance
like okay do you have the energy to
train your quads hard like yeah fuck
yeah you think you could recover oh
absolutely so why are you back buring
them like oh no specialization I heard
some kind of program heard that's good
for you it's not good because you're not
at that systemic cap if you're not
getting close to systemic limits
specialization is a fucking waste of
your time straight up
