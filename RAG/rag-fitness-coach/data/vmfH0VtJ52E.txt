hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
breaking through strength plateaus video
number five
building strength versus testing
strength
this is a juicy one i sure hope it gets
the views likes and shares not because
of monetization
money is for the feeble it's the
attention i like i like when people say
my god dr mike i loved your last video i
read every comment oh my god it fills me
with a joy that borders on the sexual i
bet you didn't want to hear that but you
might want to hear this
classic plateaued lifter complaint that
i've seen like i don't know a trillion
times
lifter's like hey man i'm not getting
any stronger and your response may be
like well how do you know i say well you
know i i'm testing my one rep max
i can't say that without laughing i'm
testing my 100 max once a week and it's
not been going up and you say well like
you know what uh what kind of training
have you been doing and they're like
i work up to my one rep max
you're like right right that's the
testing what about the training they're
like that's the training also
oh boy then we have a bit of a situation
here's the thing
testing your 1rm
does not make you much stronger
okay it just mostly shows off if other
stuff before then has made you stronger
and the thing is you get stronger by
training for strength not showing off
this is
a little different but not so different
from someone doing like posing
in the mirror at the gym and you're like
hey practicing for a show or just
working on posing off season like nah
man i'm training like
training for what they're like to get
bigger because the big guys they do this
and this grows muscle you're like oh
actually no it just shows the muscle off
now truth be told if you generate a good
deal of tension like this you can grow
some muscle if you're really weak and
really a beginner but she whiz you know
it's not really what
moves the needle a tongue just the same
way or much the same way in strength
training
one rm attempts don't really do much as
far as stimulus they do a little bit but
there are better ways to get stimulus
we'll talk about that in a bit
they do however come with a pretty big
fatigue cost
psychologically they're real fatigue
gaming real talk a 1rm is like
you got to do that shit
you got to get your nuts together in a
sack and zip that up and fucking go
you don't lose it one does not simply
actually funny story my wife and i um
i'll be more accurate i'm making my wife
watch lord of the rings trilogy with me
slowly over several weekends the
marathon thing was out of the question
and i actually got to see the one does
not simply walk into mordor thing and i
was like oh my god i haven't seen this
in years and this is this has been memed
more times than people have probably
seen lord of the rings so in any case
one does not simply want to rm like
you've got to get your shit together and
that's going to cost you psychologically
and if you're not doing them with any
bit of arousal you're really not one rem
testing and all you just do it a bunch
of singles and that has its own
downsides
especially this is the case if you have
a do or die mentality which many people
who test one arms often that's kind of
what they're getting off on right but
it's fun when you're gaining but it's
also really fatiguing now here's a real
big problem when you're testing on rms
and they're not going up or they're
going down
it's really fatiguing because the
psychological fatigue is magnified by
your feelings of failure right
this is a problem because the fatigue
adds to your program i guess in this
case you don't have much of the rest of
your program but even if you do normal
programming monday through thursday and
then saturday do all your testing
instead of doing that you're summing a
lot of fatigue you could just have been
training the amount of fatigue cost you
have to that
could have been filled up with actual
training that works it's like if you're
trying to gain weight eating and you
know shitload of your meals are like
broccoli and cauliflower rice someone's
like wouldn't they be better like actual
high calorie food you're like well
technically broccoli and cauliflower
rice have calories like yeah technically
but they sure as hell shut down your
ability to eat way more than the amount
of calories you're getting in compared
to the other foods like rice pasta etc
it's just
it's not that there's anything wrong
with eating those things and yeah they
are nominally helping you raise your
calories but at what expense that's the
thing one rm testing has a big expense
it's not the end of the world
but you could be doing better and if
you're plateauing
you need to be doing better because
clearly the shit you're doing is not
working so kind of in other
words you don't
optimally get better by testing you get
better by training
and by analogy
like if you want to be good at math you
don't get better at math by doing math
tests over and over you actually have to
study math
which if you like test taking and it's
fun
your boy loves that shit shit back in
high school i was a baller test taker
college dude
and uh i had no friends have i mentioned
that to you that's why i was good at
tests they were my friends
look taking tests to sweet you learn
some things but you really got to study
and that's how you improve your ability
to actually take the tests what ends up
happening is the gyms across the country
right now a lot of people are training
quote unquote for strength but they're
really just testing themselves all the
time and there's not a whole lot of
training happening if you're one of
these people
and it's a pretty common problem then
you may be experiencing a plateau
how do you get yourself into this kind
of stupid situation well a lot of people
start out as beginners and as a beginner
just testing your strength is such a big
relative stimulus to what you're used to
you make really really good gains
uh and also you're too weak to fatigue
yourself much like someone's like yeah
man fucking hit another winner rem on
squats 145 pounds baby woo and you're
like word up you know do you feel any
fatigue like no way like well i also
don't feel fatigued when i do fucking
behind the next skull crusher standing
with a fucking 145 you know 145 is not
that big of a deal i actually get
stronger and stronger get into squatting
225 275 for max it starts beating you up
a little more and because you're not a
beginner anymore you don't get that big
stimulus and all of a sudden the
stimulus to fatigue ratio is all wrong
and that could cause you to get into
a plateau so if
you continue to train over time testing
starts out as decent training and
incrementally falls to where it's really
shitty training so if you're doing
testing often
stop
to quote
the karen's of social media can you just
like
not i mean you just like stop uh
i love it that's how i read those
comments i think that's an accurate
reading so
instead of testing i got you one better
do three to four months
of training with multiple sets of
roughly three to six reps percent
right slowly increase how much weight
you're using every session or every
other session by five to ten pounds here
and there
on your sets of three to six
maybe even some assistance work you
don't even have to do that
use deals and recovery sessions when you
feel a bit beat up and you can't go and
repeat this cycle for a few months
this will actually cause the strength
gains because the volume is finally high
enough to provide a stimulus you
essentially just get more practice
and
after this you know several month period
take a month to practice sets of one to
three a peaking phase basically
then test your maxes
and very likely you'll have gotten a lot
stronger so your problem was that you
were testing and not training enough now
that you're mostly training and only
testing at the end gee you know looks
like you had no problem at all now
this requires patience
coming from a world in which you test
all the time to a world in which you
test once every i don't know five months
or something four months
uh that's rough so do you have to do
that no maybe start testing once every
other week once every three weeks and
just fill in the other time with high
quality training if you really can't
just pull your way cold turkey from
actually testing all the time
it requires patience and patience is a
virtue you've probably heard that your
whole life hopefully
during the time that you're doing this
training you won't be able to tell if
your arms are going up and that could
make you skittish oh i better test
don't do that don't do that why because
you're not fucking 10 years old 10 year
olds watching this i really apologize
first point second point if you're ten
go ask mom and dad to turn this off turn
on youtube kids or whatever barney the
dinosaur i don't know if that's the
thing still when i was growing up your
boy was watching that shit
uh don't watch this channel if you're
ten i don't even know what kind of shit
you'll learn you'll have an interesting
vocabulary highly intellectual
vocabulary into swearing in obscene ways
so you're not 10 which is to say you
don't need constant gratification okay
if you tell me straight face we needed a
gym okay man i gotta test every week
otherwise i get demotivated i'm going to
do one of these like
world's longest blink versus usual my
fucking blank ticks that i do anyway
you'll get both damn it so
come on you're in this for the long haul
you want results you got to put in the
work that's like eating a bite of food
and be like fuck fucking my big measure
my biceps what the fuck is wrong with
you finish the food finish 10 meals
over the week finish 80 meals over
whatever multiple months and then
measure your biceps and then maybe
you'll have something to it so
gaining strength and testing strength
are really quite different and the more
advanced you get and the more likely you
are hip plateaus
the more likely you are to hit plateaus
then the more different they really are
and
if your plateau is a testing problem and
not a gaining problem your solution is
super simple
you start to train to gain you do that
for months and you may very well like
the outcome of the tests when they're
relatively infrequent give you time to
train and time to get stronger
folks i'll see you next week for the
next video in the series you had better
be stronger and if even one of you
tests their 1rm in the following week
i'm not releasing the video we'll just
put up a black screen and say somebody
lied
see you next week
you
