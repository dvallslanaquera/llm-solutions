don't drop your fats too low you need
them for hormone production for
testosterone production you have more
drive to train more sex drive which is
just fun and also more actual chemical
drive by directly by testosterone to
keep muscle on your body huge Factor so
cutting your fat like crazy usually
isn't worth it if you're at about 0.3
grams per pound per day which if you
weigh 200 pounds that's like 60 grams of
fat per day for example anything lower
than that probably not worth the
trade-off
