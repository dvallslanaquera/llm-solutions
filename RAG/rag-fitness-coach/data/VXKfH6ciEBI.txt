hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
spiritization
welcome back to the targeting the muscle
series today's episode is on the lat
pulldown if you have trouble
feeling your lats
getting your lats hit experiencing lat
soreness all that stuff growing your
lats stimulating your lats with a lat
pull down we have some tips and tricks
for you to maybe get to feel that muscle
a little bit more help you target that
muscle stimulate the lats and get an
enormous back that inconveniences you at
every turn
let's take a look at our first tip
all right tip number one
is to play around with the kind of grips
that you're taking
there are a lot of options
super common question we get is what's
the ideal grip for the lat pull down in
order to simulate the lats or various
other parts of the back to be completely
honest with you there is no possible
answer it's just not the way the system
of knowledge works because people are
built differently there can be no
correct answer right it's like saying
what's the ideal size spoon to eat with
unless you're brian shaw and your six
foot whatever the fucking thousand
pounds might need a bigger spoon than a
baby who can't even pick up brian shaw's
spoon same way here we have a lot of
options let me use my height deficiency
and by the way for those of you asking
i'm four foot eleven and a half
how do i get up to this thing well
hi
hi oh my god i can see the wild
what are the options
super wide absolutely a fine grip
especially if it feels okay on your
shoulder
standard wide grip which is usually on
the crease
a grip just in here and you guessed it
every single fist or even two finger
increment on the way in up until you're
over here and then it's narrow grip and
this is a perfectly viable grip so all
of these grips will change the movement
slightly for example
if
you're gripping ultra wide
and we're doing a lat pull down at the
very bottom you might not be able to
arch anymore you might have to roll your
shoulders over a little bit
to touch
whereas
if you have a more narrow grip you might
be able to pull down and stay strict the
entire time so just a heads up
when
you are experimenting with different
grips
it will change the feel of the movement
will change the mechanics but that's a
good thing because if one of these isn't
seemingly hitting your lats all that
well there's pretty decent chance that
one of them will how do you best
implement these play around one day
and find which one really feels
seemingly the best
minimum or no joint pain in the
shoulders elbows wrists and one in which
you can really feel your back
contracting and expanding
once you find that variant or several to
use in a program that lasts one to two
months
use it use it use it repeatedly because
as you use it week in and week out you
actually are able to micro adjust make
corrections and really groove into it if
after you know one or two months of
using it you take a deload you're like
oh that felt really great i'm gonna keep
it great you got yourself a fine
exercise however if you didn't love it
try another variation preferably a
pretty different one
for another few weeks give it justice as
long as it feels good on the test give
it a few weeks
i've had situations where i've tried a
variation i tried a grip i didn't love
it it felt okay
after a few weeks i loved it it worked
great so don't just say uh it feels
weird this time find something that
feels decent try it try it for a while
then try something else and after a
while you'll probably have a collection
of lat pull-down grips that work really
well for you
all right folks
next tip
is another series of techniques for you
to try
there's no one right way to do a pull
down some people prefer one some prefer
the other and there's actually a
spectrum of options in between
one of the ways maybe the classic way
is to pull the bar straight down and
touch right around your clavicles right
at the base of your neck nothing wrong
with a great option another way to do
pull downs is actually to touch
somewhere along your sternum just below
your pecs and of course everything in
between is also a valid answer
which one of these is better for lats no
clue you could be built a little
differently than some other people and
the answer is completely different it
could be all the correct answers could
be none the correct answer but if you
don't know about it you might have
written off the lat pulldown is not a
great exercise if you've only been
touching the clavicles
try a mesocycle two you know four to
eight weeks of training where you go to
the sternum every single time and you
may find that that's better and vice
versa
[Music]
next option you should try both to see
which one that uh you seem to get a
better stimulus from
one option is to stay completely upright
and pulling the bar down so you stay
upright you don't lean back
touch come back up
touch come back up notice there's no
leaning nothing like that the other
option
which i personally prefer
is
before i start pulling i'll lean back a
ton it's not a momentum thing where i'm
doing this it's not to lift more weight
i lean back a little bit and all of a
sudden
this arc here
versus a straight up and down feels like
it hits my back better
so i'm slightly lean back
i touch and here's the important thing
you still want a big stretch at the top
so i would recommend leaning forward at
the top to get a big stretch reaching up
with your hands lean back
pull
lean forward lean back and pull versus
stay straight up
and just do lat pull downs just like
that again
there's no correct answer try both
see which one you seem to get a better
stimulus from
[Music]
next tip
feel free to use a bunch of different
attachments
there's not just the straight bar i've
got a sampling here there's way more
attachments than that i'm actually
trying to build an attachment collection
but we got the mag grip
shade over here um
you basically put your hands in like
this like that and of course pull
sometimes for some people it feels
amazing and they report that with these
kinds of grips they can really feel
their back in their lats much better
than with a straight bar totally fine
you can use that for a while and again
we're not looking for the forever
correct answer we're looking for the
correct answer for the next
mesocycle of training next 48 weeks of
heart training then a deload and then
you can use it again or switch to
something else here's a cool one you
won't see in many places
non-rotating bar it just happens to be
colored red
blood i bought it off a vampire so in
any case here's the thing
you plug it in like this
notice there's no rotation so if you put
your versa grips or straps in
it locks and that way if your grip is
limiting factor on pull downs and you're
just like fuck i can't get the shit to
work right my forms always pump up and
even on a regular pull uh down bar it's
a rotating bar so even if you have
reversa grip sometimes it starts to slip
away if you try this bar notice thin and
non-rotating holy fucking shit with a
lot of these bars you can feel like your
grip is stapled in and then it's all
back which is two things one you get
more reps
limited now by your lats instead of your
forearms and two if your grip isn't a
thing you have to think about anymore if
it's locked in with straps or versa
grips or chalk then all you have to do
is think about your back which is great
because you get a better mind muscle
connection lastly just as a sampling
this is not only the three correct
answers oh no what
fuck this is
how it works
i know basic anatomy
don't put your dick in here
you know
bad things will happen or do and fun
things will happen never can tell this
is cool because these are independently
rotating and you can pull them all sorts
of wacky ways you can use this for
rolling as well it's a neat bar
i got it i used it like for one mezzo
and i was like
yeah
that was neat
in any case
cornucopia of grips try them all some of
them
will make you
think oh i'm wasting my time the
straight bars better totally cool
some of them you don't know which ones
you'll use them and you'll be like holy
fucking shit i wrote lap pulldowns off
entirely but with this grip
i'm a fucking i might as well be part of
the machine and then all of a sudden you
have a new friend
[Music]
last tip here for lat pull downs if you
have trouble feeling lats trouble
stimulating trouble targeting what you
can do is try to control the eccentric a
little bit better so what i see a lot
and this happens and some people it
works for them is they'll do lat pull
downs boom
boom just like a machine totally fine if
you struggle with stimulating your lats
what you could do is come down nice and
quick but then on the way back up you
may want to slow the eccentric really
control it and really feel your elbows
traveling up in an arc only restrained
by your lats
touch and then
slow and let your elbows arc and then
touch him and slow
it's gonna want
to bounce right off your chest slow it
down immediately even below your chin
control and then you're good to go all
right that's all the tips we have so far
to help you feel your lats and your back
a little bit more during lat pull downs
