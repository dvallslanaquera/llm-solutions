welcome back guys in this video i'm
going to show you how to do a side
tricep pose so first turn sideways
spike your left calf
and then bend your knees and push your
right knee inwards so you can reveal
more hamstring size and definition like
this
then interlock your hands with your left
hand underneath and your right ankle
over it
grab your hands
extend your elbow so you can reveal more
tricep of your adult definition
and once you're here
puff up your chest a little bit arch
your lower back
and then exhale the air to reveal some
added definition
and then twist your upper body over
without twisting your lower body
so you can reveal more of your v-taper
and overall
create a nicer taper with the illusion
of broader shoulders taking small
breaths you can also do a vacuum side
tricep in which you take a big breath
into your chest and make your waist
appear as small as possible
like this
