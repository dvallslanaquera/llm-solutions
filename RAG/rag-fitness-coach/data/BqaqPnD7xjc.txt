somebody talked to me
what's up guys dr mike here saturday am
mass building back workout today is a
vertical pull emphasis we're going to be
doing probably some sort of assisted
pull-up
or reps then we're going to be doing
hopefully we can get in
to some kind of interesting pull-down
variation you don't find at most gyms
hopefully the prime pull-down which is
an awesome force curve we'll talk about
that in a bit
and then some kind of machine row three
exercises three to four sets each
good to go and then later today we're
going to be doing again shoulders biceps
and forearms
oh and yeah i'm next to my lambo no big
deal yeah it's mine
red i love that color because it reminds
me of blood and
shit like that because i'm tough um word
up yo
whatever sound lambo makes my lambo
lamborghini insurance does not pay for
itself i have 10 lamborghinis i wasn't
lying
[Music]
hey folks exercise number one assisted
pull-up
why assisted since we're all strong
enough to do pull-ups it's so
we can develop a better mind muscle
connection specifically with a pulling
musculature like the lats
number one number two to get more
repetitions through sometimes a larger
range of motion
so there's nothing magical about the
sister pull up and if you can do and get
great workouts
out of regular pull-ups which we often
still do all the time absolutely go for
it
but this system pull-up can be an
interesting tool to maximize sfr
and get more strict repetitions we'll
start with this exercise and we'll move
on from there three to four sets that's
10 to 20 reps let's do it
[Applause]
[Music]
they made a machine for resting between
sets of heavy compound movements
oh this is awesome and you can kick your
leg up too
[Music]
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
all right folks more pull-down volume
slightly less resistance still in the 10
to 20 rep range but we're more fatigued
i'm gonna use the prime pull down today
to wear your machine
highly effective here's why at the very
top
unlike most vac machines and free weight
back training the machine loads you
significantly at the bottom
closer to here it loads you less which
matches the force curve
of your actual vertical pulley movement
super super well
so you get a really high quality
contraction here tons of tension
and all the way through instead of one
end being really disproportionate to the
other
a lot of people would say hey you should
do band assisted pull-ups
because you can do more reps it's less
weight unfortunately the band literally
flips the force curve
backwards from what is optimal so the
band makes
easier at the top where it should be
harder and it makes it harder at the
bottom
where it should be much easier the prime
pull down fix this problem
if you have a chance to use one do it
the stimulus to fatigue ratio for this
thing is
unbelievable you gotta try to believe it
but we're gonna do
three or four sets see how we feel let's
get after
don't flash it me
um
oh
hi dr mike here we are doing
a prime seated row for our third
movement here today
for am session on saturday uh this is
after what the fuck do we do
assistant pull-ups and prime pull-downs
so this is to kind of text the backs a
little more
and yeah let's get to it i've been
replaced
[Applause]
[Applause]
uh
[Music]
oh
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
rice
[Music]
so
all right folks that was the back
workout
three or four sets of assisted pull-ups
three or four sets of pull-downs
essentially
and then three or four sets of machine
rows could have done free weight rows
could have done barbell rows
a lot of times we do just one of those
freeway barbell rows a week like you did
this week
and because our like training and our
back training taxes the lumbar area so
much and the spinal erector so much
that a lot of times we opt for a machine
row a little bit less taxation
especially in the lower lumbar area
so that's the workout this is workout
number nine of 10 workouts of the week
saturday am we're going to come back
later today in the pm
and hit the last of three shoulder
biceps and forearm training sessions
we are tired we are beat up it's how you
should feel at the end of a training
week
we get sunday off we'll feel much better
get into the next week of training and
or if it's your peak week you get into
deload
see you in a few
you
