there's just so much garbage information
out there in the youtube fitness space
these days
and you really do need to be careful
where you're getting your advice from
because it really can make the
difference between
success and failure so these are six
guys that you can trust
for quality content without the bs
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today we're going to switch gears
a bit
i've done a handful of critique style
videos over the past few months where
i've been
breaking down different pieces of
misleading content and
some scammy products to help you guys
stay on the proper path toward your
fitness goals
and to help you save money at the same
time and the response to those videos
has been
overwhelmingly positive probably 95
positive overall
so i'm really glad that you guys are
enjoying those videos and that you're
getting
solid value from them however there's
always a small portion of the audience
who
uh really aren't a fan of that style of
content saying things like
you know you're just a hater or stop
trying to tear people down quit being so
negative or whatever else
[Music]
and the truth is that yeah i definitely
am a hater
when it comes to blatant misinformation
and to content creators who take
advantage of their audience
by selling them overpriced shitty
products that don't actually work
we also like to use one tablespoon of
bell carnitine
it helps to convert fat to your energy
great stuff guys
i absolutely do hate that stuff and i
also know that pointing it out
genuinely helps people and so that's why
i do it uh but that said i'm definitely
not a hater
in the typical way that that term is
used i don't hate on anybody just for
the sake of it
i'm just calling things as i see them
you know if i think something is bad
then i'll say it's bad
but if i think it's good i'll also say
it's good and there are a handful of
fitness youtubers out there
who i do think are good who i think are
honest and legit and give
solid information and who i genuinely do
want to see succeed
because they're making a positive impact
so that's what this video is about today
i'm going to list off six other fitness
youtubers who i personally think
fall into that category and who i would
be comfortable recommending to you
now before i jump into it keep in mind
that this doesn't necessarily mean that
i agree with every single thing every
one of these guys says
um i probably agree with like 95 plus of
it but there are always going to be
at least small points of disagreement no
matter what because no two people are
exactly the same
that's totally normal also these are
just six people that i'm mentioning
today
there are obviously others out there as
well who are also putting up quality
content but these are just
six that i'm aware of and who came to
mind and lastly
yes everyone on this list happens to be
male that doesn't mean that i don't
think
there are high quality female fitness
youtubers out there as well
but the people who generally make the
same type of content that i also make
and the type of content that i would
naturally follow they just tend to be
male 1
you're saying that women aren't
intelligent enough no i didn't say that
at all
if you're new to the channel then hit
that subscribe button below and turn on
notifications to stay up to date on all
of my future content
and let's jump into it six legit fitness
youtubers in no
particular order first on the list is
mario thomas now i've followed mero's
content for
uh probably the last five years or so
and he consistently puts out high
quality
practical no [ __ ] advice i really
don't have a single criticism
that i can think of when it comes to
mario's content his stuff leans a bit
more toward the fat loss side of things
and he just really has a thorough
understanding of what truly matters
when it comes to helping someone reach
their fitness goals you're not going to
find any gimmicks or nonsense on his
channel
it's all centered around creating the
proper habits the proper lifestyle
change
and the proper overall mindset that you
need to get to your goal physique and to
maintain it for the long run that's
another thing
that mario is big on it's not just about
getting to a certain goal but also about
how to realistically maintain it for
life
there's so many channels out there
trying to give you all these special
little hacks and
breakthrough fat loss tips you know the
90 of things that
might make up 10 of your overall results
or might even have no effect at all
whereas with mario you're getting the
information that you truly need to hear
and that's going to be responsible for
the vast majority of
your results so mario thomas is legit
and i have zero hesitation
in recommending his content the second
youtuber on the list
is lane norton aka bio lane i mean if
you want to talk about ogs in the
fitness industry
lane is definitely one of them i don't
know exactly when he started but he's
been putting out online fitness content
at least since the early 2000s i'm 34
now
and i started lifting when i was 13. and
before youtube or instagram or any of
that stuff
the way that people interacted was
through bodybuilding message boards and
i remember asking layne questions
um and getting advice from him all the
way back when i was like 14 or 15 years
old and he was
probably like 18 or 19. so this guy has
been around the block
he's got a phd in nutritional science
he's a champion power lifter he's
competed in natural bodybuilding
and he has contributed a ton to the
fitness industry over the years
very knowledgeable guy very rational
logical thinker which i'm a fan of
and someone you can definitely count on
to tell things like they are
he's definitely a bit of a polarizing
character you know he deals with a lot
of criticism because of how outspoken he
is about things
but it's pretty obvious to me that lane
is not a hateful person
he just cares about things being
accurate and like myself he really hates
seeing people
being misled he's very active in calling
out misinformation
and he's pretty ruthless in the process
which i have no issue with whatsoever
the school of greatness apparently
[ __ ] idiot can also sub
in for greatness people especially lie
when they have
[ __ ] to sell i bet he's going to
talk some nonsense about the
mitochondria and try to sound
smart when in reality he's a [ __ ]
idiot
but he talks absolute horseshit
wow that's a lot of marketing [ __ ] right
in there
that means [ __ ] all all this [ __ ] i've
seen before
not impressed i've come to the
conclusion that some turds
just will not flush uh blatant scammers
don't deserve any mercy as far as i'm
concerned
um and yeah as much as some people might
think that lane is a negative person
uh the truth is that he's a very
positive force in terms of bringing
truth to the fitness industry and when i
listen to lane i know that i'm listening
to a real person
giving their real thoughts and not just
some other dime a dozen
fitness industry muppet what's going on
guys so lane gets a big thumbs up from
me
the third fitness youtuber on the list
is ben carpenter
the majority of ben's following is
actually over on instagram but he does
have a youtube channel as well and he
does put out videos consistently
uh so he still qualifies for this list
ben is another guy that i've known about
for
probably around five years or so and
someone who consistently puts
out evidence-based well-thought-out
[ __ ] free
content he talks about the stuff that
you don't necessarily want to hear
because he's not promoting
quick fixes or any of that garbage but
it's the stuff that you actually
need to hear and the stuff that's going
to truly make an impact on your results
he dispels a lot of harmful nutrition
myths he also goes into the mindset side
of things
and gives some very helpful advice in
that area he mixes humor into his
content and i personally find his
sort of dry sarcastic sense of humor
pretty entertaining
so i'm going to show you a very simple
tip to increase the results you get from
your upper body workouts
this is how most people would do their
dumbbell cups and of course this is
absolutely fine
however from spending years observing
the biggest people in the gym
i've noticed a strong correlation of how
muscular they are
and how close to the mirror they train
so we're going to do exactly the same
curl but just
right up right up against the mirror
just like that and this is what i like
to call the alternative anabolic window
hypothesis so
this zone here right in front of the
mirror
that's where you need to live if you
want to get the best muscle building
results
he goes over actual studies and analyzes
the findings in a way that people can
understand
he does commentary on the fitness
industry as a whole and he also isn't
afraid to call out [ __ ] either which
he does on a pretty regular basis
and he just seems to me like a genuine
down-to-earth guy
who really cares about his audience and
who wants to give them the best
information possible
and he's pretty [ __ ] strong at
pull-ups too
[Music]

instagrammer who i am very comfortable
recommending

it really helps get the video out there
so that even more people can get the
accurate information they need
to improve their health and fitness i
really appreciate the support
now moving on number four on the list of
legit fitness youtubers
is steve shaw now i've known about steve
shaw for quite a while
but i never really watched a ton of his
videos um i would just kind of come
across them every now and then
but recently i really took a closer look
at his channel and went through a bunch
of his videos and i just found myself
nodding in agreement over and over and
over again his advice is more so focused
on the lifting end of things and on
overall
muscle growth and strength development
and there's just so much lame
gimmicky advice out there when it comes
to this subject things that move people
away from the fundamentals and into the
territory of just
aimlessly [ __ ] around and wasting
their time on a bunch of [ __ ] that
really doesn't matter you know super
fancy exercise variations
fluffy pump style bodybuilding training
obsessing over little details that you
really don't need to be worrying about
and steve's content is a firm wake-up
call to bring you back to reality
stop [ __ ] around stop jacking off
stop whacking off and get your ass to
the gym
you need to be consistent you need to
stop missing workouts and you need to
you need to really focus on plus ones
adding reps
and adding weight we all know that
progressive overload is king isolation
exercises
will never be as good as compound
movements big bodybuilding type of
lifters
um will say i don't train for strength
but they're still stronger way stronger
than the average individual
all the different workout types all the
different approaches and training
schemes you'll find basic
standard pillars of success that's what
i try to boil everyone down to
okay progressive overload on the basic
compound movements training hard
proper form consistency just like
everyone that i've mentioned so far on
this list
steve is giving you the information you
actually need without all the
unnecessary bells and whistles
just an all-around no [ __ ] guy which
in an industry absolutely overflowing
with
endless piles of steaming stinky
[ __ ]
this is the kind of content that we need
more of so steve shaw another fitness
youtuber that i would recommend
and speaking of avoiding unnecessary
gimmicks and fluff advice
if you do want to grab a free program
that includes a step-by-step workout
routine
caloric starting point based on your
goals with a sample meal plan
and recommended science-based
supplements as well make sure to visit
shawnell.com
custom after this video is done fill out
the form on that page and i'll get back
to you in a few
days with a free plan that you can get
started on all right the fifth fitness
youtuber on the list
is jeffrey verity schofield now jeffrey
is a newer fitness youtuber
he's been making videos for less than a
year so his subscriber base is not quite
as large as some of the others
but don't be fooled by that because if
there is one thing that i can guarantee
you
it's that someone's subscriber count is
not a reliable indicator of their
knowledge base
in fact some of the very worst fitness
channels on youtube
are the ones with the most subscribers
because what mostly dictates
someone's subscriber count is
marketability not their actual
knowledge and jeffrey actually does have
a pretty significant online fitness
following anyway
but it's mostly over on the q a site
quora whereas content has something like
50
million views at this point jeffrey is
another guy that you can trust
for honest practical lifting and
nutrition info and if you follow his
advice
you simply cannot go wrong he posts a
lot of his own lifting footage if that's
something you enjoy watching
he does critique style videos as well
and he's always very accurate with the
assessments that he makes
he mixes in humor so that his videos are
both informative and entertaining
and i fully expect to see his channel
take off over the coming months and
years
so jeffrey verity schofield definitely
one of the good guys
and finally number six on the list um if
you're looking for down-to-earth
science-based fitness information for
natural lifters without any crazy
in-your-face hype then i would highly
recommend checking out brad
castleberry i might say of anyone on
this list he probably gives the most
valuable advice
that's what it's about all day long
and i really think that you should go
ahead and follow just [ __ ] with you
number six is the doc himself greg
doucette now i'm sure most of you are
already familiar with greg
um he's got one of the fastest growing
fitness channels on youtube
and he's definitely a character i hate
it
i read it i'm like my brother don't
comment don't write them back and i'm
like
how do i do this i care so much about
telling them they're morons
the only way that you can track your
calories is to eat the same thing every
day
do i give a [ __ ] if my balls shrink a
zito
i don't care about having small balls it
makes your dick
look bigger if anything it's a bonus now
i would say that greg's videos kind of
walk the line between
information slash entertainment his
advice is definitely
beginner based which is fine because
most people watching youtube fitness
content are beginners
and even greg himself has said that he
purposely keeps things really simple
for that reason it's not because he
doesn't have the more advanced knowledge
but i think that he just intentionally
keeps it basic and purposely hammers the
fundamentals
so pushing yourself intensely in the gym
you know training harder than last time
which is basically just
another way of saying progressive
overload uh focusing on overall calorie
balance and then setting your diet up in
the most enjoyable and sustainable way
possible
maintaining realistic expectations about
what is naturally obtainable
and the main reason why i would put greg
on this list is because
he has such a large outreach and he
calls out so much [ __ ] in the
industry
um he puts out videos almost every
single day and so i just think that he's
a very
positive force in terms of helping to
clean things up and to steer people away
from all the misleading advice out there
the number of people out there who would
have fallen for garbage advice from
some fake charlatan youtuber but then
they didn't because they saw one of
greg's videos
that's probably a very high number of
people and so i appreciate greg's
content for that reason uh plus i just
find him to be pretty entertaining
personally i watch his stuff mostly for
entertainment value but if you are a
novice trainee then you'll definitely
learn
some valuable information as well so
there you have it guys
