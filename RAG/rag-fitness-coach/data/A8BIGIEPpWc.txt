[Music]
phillip harbison npc super heavyweight
bodybuilder mike izertel
fake youtube lifting doctor bser i would
say a swear word but youtube algorithm
says we can't swear in the intro so what
we can do in the intro is tell you about
our humongous back workout for phillips
humongous back we are going to be doing
crazy stuff
super bodybuilding back workout i'll
introduce you to the next exercise in a
split second let's go watch phillips
back below up out of his body with his
lats and tear his major hitting people
in the face in the gym blood everywhere
it's going to be amazing let's do it
[Music]
first exercise is something interesting
for you folks to consider doing yourself
is a little quirky we're going to be
doing a bent over row to the chest right
to the nipple line yes i said nipple
and
we're going to be supersetting that so
after a set of that real close to
failure phillips going to put the weight
down readjust real quick not rest a long
time and then do regular bent rows which
are easier with the same weight to the
tummy so it's road to chest superset of
bent row you've seen isb pro jared
feather do these it's an amazing
exercise it jacks your back up in a
special special way let's get started
yep
stable steady
all arms yep that's it
relax
settle down go
bent row set up big chest butt up
back right there yes go
one touch gently
two point that chest to this guy the
whole fucking time yes three let's get
eight
four no swinging no fucking bullshit
five good let's go
six two more you gotta ride that
eccentric down slow yes one last one go
and slow
very good now we're fucking rolling
[Applause]
good god that's not the kind of bad
grandma can see and
like process she's going to be like
nothing this old thing
tight back chest up the whole time
stay completely upright there you go
there you go
beautiful one pull it higher even
phillip bass he weighs like 260 pounds
lean 260 at like 6'3
he's using
pounds for this exercise for sets of
like 10 to 20 reps what if your lower
back hurts if you're really systemically
fatigued if you can't if your legs are
still super sore and you can't do super
heavy bent rows this superset allows you
to keep the weight really light but
because it focuses so much on the right
parts of the back it allows you to have
that light load still exert a huge
stimulative effect now of course after a
few weeks you'd be up over 135 into like
135 to 165 range but that's still
nothing compared to what he regularly
bent rows it's an awesome way to lower
systemic fatigue that doesn't mean it's
the answer but it's a really decent
option for you to think about in your
own training
one slow
no hinging
two that was good two more get your shit
together arch your back before you go
go
one slow
all back slow and that's it
dude good stuff good stuff
got an upper back pump
a little bit a little bit of a pump very
good
very good all right that's it for this
one
[Music]
fuck you scott
dr mike falls off of whatever
news at 11.
holy shit
he's so tall pull downs another super
set for you guys to try at home we're
going to be doing a really lat focus
superset first exercise is a lat pull
down touching right below the nipple
line really really gets your lash
through full range of motion great peak
contraction
as soon as you're done with that we go
into a slightly mechanically
advantageous position of pulling back
and ideally the target is the clavicle
but you may not have the flexibility
philip just got too much muscle in his
back to do that so as long as you get
just below your chin you're good to go
that doesn't mean you start swinging
around that means you pull as low as you
can but it's close to your face the bar
the whole time so set number one is here
set number two is here let's get it done
touch go
yes one more one more go
yep
[Music]
you're good let's get five
five
to the chin
one excellent
two beautiful
three big stretch slow yes

oh you got a few more philip let's go
two more two more do you want to go or
not

two stop nodding no one start nodding
yes not yes let's go let's go let's go
you ready you're ready four more
one yes
two come on
three
all the way
yes good that's it that's it that's it
good stuff
all right tall guy can you take this off
and put it on here
[Music]
so straight arm lat pull downs
you make the straight arms and you pull
down with your lats
now i have a couple pointers but
generally speaking you want to make sure
you get a real big stretch at the top
gently come all the way down and you're
going to want to do a mind muscle
connection where you pull with your lats
do your arms have to be straight or can
slightly vent work both are totally fine
do whichever is more comfortable
whichever lets you get the most number
of reps and actually connect with your
back musculature
sets of 10 to 20 here let's get to it
14 time to get tough
[Music]
15 yes open up for it open up big
[Music]
16 four more
bonus round time let's go
one
work with me
go
to resist
go
three resist so you guys will notice
that in some of these sets what i'm
doing is i'm pressing down on the weight
hard during philips eccentric phase
that's because on the eccentric phase
you can produce more force do more
damage and probably trigger more growth
if the forces are higher and in this
setup it's really easy for us to do
essentially accentuated eccentric
loading is that a sustainable strategy
yes it's difficult to do because an
individual can't really grade the same
force all the time so you'll have to
track all of your other back exercise
progress and just pepper this in and
hope it's not you know something that's
super super variable good training
stimulus don't worry about tracking this
force right down all your reps but it's
going to be off a little bit also a
great thing to do every now and again at
the very tail end of a mesocycle last
workout like this where we push it
really really all the way it's a great
strategy nothing magical just something
to try a lot of other exercises like
dumbbells and stuff i mean you really
can't do this because guys will ask you
to sort of pick it up on the way up and
do forced reps this isn't exactly forced
reps all the concentrics he does by
himself the eccentrics are the ones that
are super super loaded allowing us a
really good combination of both worlds
one
good technique slow
two
slow
three go go go slow slow slow slow
that's it and one fun drops at one point
drops it just for fun just for fun fuck
it ten go
smooth not slow normal speed one normal
normal normal speed go
two pump em out there you go
three
four six more good technique
five
six
[Music]
seven no fucking swinging still seven
seven good
eight careful on that fucking swinging
nine and one
[Music]
why not noises you have a blooper reel
just annoying i make
strange animal noises nine sets of back
not bad this is something you'd probably
do twice a week if you want a really
huge back
and uh how was it it was tough it was a
lot of tough super sex yeah a lot of
pump yeah a lot of pump uh want to hit a
rear double for us or your last spread
look at that fancy posing
good shit
folks see you next time for the next
workout
finger guns
