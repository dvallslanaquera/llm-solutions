hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
as usual as most likely
that's why i'm on here folks today we
are going to make the case
against full range of motion training
for hypertrophy
what but hold on it's that april fools
what the hell am i doing talking shit
about full range for hypertrophy holy
crap the world is coming to a
fucking end but hold on let's get into
the meat potatoes because i promise
i can explain myself first of all
full range of motion is still the
default best way to train
let's think about why point number one
research just shows that
well sort of like nine out of 10 times
it just beats partials
when you compare directly partials to
full rom there's like uh one or two
studies that shows
partials are as good or better and then
probably like eight studies that show
the other way
alright so if i was a gambling man and
you were doing all partials and i'd say
yeah you know have you looked at the
research
i probably wouldn't bet on you growing
as much muscle as you could with full
range of motion so
your empirical evidence is very very
good the range of motion
when it's uh full versus partial is just
better for hypertrophy
now that's not just empirical evidence
and we sort of don't have any idea
why that would happen we expect it to
happen based on
lots of research back theoretical
mechanisms such as
stretch under load okay so tension
imposed under
stretch seems to cause in some ways an
independent hypertrophic mechanism
than just tension by itself so there may
be something distressing muscles at long
muscle lengths
that is hypertrophic which is very good
because that's you know full range of
motion does a whole lot of that
and when you go through a full range of
motion versus partial you're likely to
activate and thus stimulate the growth
of more fibers
like if you just train like this there's
some muscle fibers that don't really
turn on much or at all
um and they might not get a ton of
stimulus but if you go all the way up
and down
you're probably likely to activate more
muscle fibers perhaps still not all of
them optimally but more of them
and thus get more hypertrophy so not
it's not just that we have research that
says look
most of the time full range is better we
also have theory that says look we
probably expect it to be better and when
we find that it's better
it makes a whole lot of sense right
number three
and this one is interesting because a
lot of people will say well yeah full
ramen theory but to me it doesn't apply
because partials for me are better
myself and a couple of folks that i
train with jared feather particularly
we're always really skeptical when
people say that because from an
experiential perspective at least as
us and most the folks we've ever trained
or
associated with a report you know
experientially the stimulus to fatigue
ratio is often much better for higher
range of motion
than lower range of motion executions of
exercises
oftentimes greatly so what do we mean by
that well the perception of tension
under load is usually insane
when you do a high range of motion
people say like oh man i really feel my
quads during squats and they're doing
halfway down you're like
why don't you try all the way down and
at the bottom of a high bar squat there
dude i feel like my quads are going to
rip off of my body like ah
okay sweet so check the tension deep
stretch in the packs you
really crush your pecs and if you just
do flies like this yeah you feel tension
in them but it's nothing to write home
about
the burn when you do full range of
motion leg presses
each rep takes like three fucking
seconds it fries you
this burn the entire time it's awful at
least as good as with partials
probably better the pump anytime we have
folks transition to more full range of
motion
they just get a better pump in many
cases and it's just like this
wild pump like holy crap i can't even
move anything you know
full range of motion has an incredible
effect on that at least as good as
partials often better
and disruption case closed you want to
mess yourself up really deliver that
stimulus
there's no way to do it better than full
range of motion if you do stiff-legged
deadlifts and you stop halfway to where
you should yeah
if you do enough of them you'll get sore
you do full range of motion stuff like a
deadlift where you're
stretching under load the hamstrings at
the very bottom position
oh my god you do two or three sets of
those you won't be able to walk
as a matter of fact a gentleman actually
just got back to me on the calf training
video that we did and he's like hey i
tried all your stuff which is a lot of
it is just
preaching full range of motion he's like
i didn't think it worked but then after
three days my soreness peaked and now i
can't walk like
tada right i talk about three-day doms i
mean some serious disruption occurring
that's not always a great thing
but if you train with full range of
motion you actually have to do fewer
reps and fewer sets to get the same
degree of disruption as if you train
with partials in some way partials
almost protect you
against receiving damage and probably
receiving a great deal of stimulus as
well
on the fatigue side of stimulus to
fatigue so we covered the stimulus side
on the fatigue side
you get much lower joint and connective
tissue fatigue in most cases
will full range of motions partials mess
up your joints why
because you have to use so much more
weight to get to the same rep ranges
full range of motion done properly is
you should be really really good on the
joints
and a lot of people when they see you
going all the way down your squats they
see you going all the way down in your
benches they see you locking out tricep
extensions
they say shit like oh but that's really
bad for your joints now mind you they're
saying that with zero data
and actually zero theoretical rationale
what they're doing is uh the economist
thomas soul would describe as a notion
which is like an idea in their head that
hasn't been vetted thought out or
anything
without that bad free joints right like
why nick shaw the
co-founder of rp and i were training
once in a gym back when we were early
20s and nick shaw was doing
olympic style super deep squats and this
guy comes up to him and he goes
isn't that like bad for your knees and
nick's like oh
maybe why do you think and the guy just
literally all he says is he just goes
like this
he makes this with his hands he goes
well
and nick's like what do you mean the
guy's like i don't know man i just
thought that
you know and that was all he had like
somebody told him it was bad and they
just
repeated it joints are designed to go
through a full range of motion
and joints will become progressively
more irritated if your technique is
wrong
and or if you load them very heavily all
the time and one of those is a guarantee
if you don't go through a full range of
motion you still want to train hard so
it's probably better for joint
connectivity that's certainly been the
case with most of our clients
and most of the people we've talked to
what about the rp like rating of
perceived position how hard is training
well on the one hand four range of
motion is fucking hard because you have
to go all the way down in squats nobody
wants to do that right that's as a
quintessential
example makes training harder but on the
other hand you have to use less weight
and the failure point is very obvious
like when you go to failure four range
of motion you're just like
that's it right so in some cases i think
that the rpe
that balances out yeah you use more
weight uh but you know
or less weight for full range of motion
but at the same time it's less
comfortable so i think it's probably
about even rpe
and probably equivalent systemic fatigue
yes you do a
greater displacement and thus the
systemic fatigue is higher because the
physical work you're doing
is generally higher you would think but
then it's actually the same amount of
work you end up doing because you have
to jack up the load so much
and jacking up the load does have a real
profound effect on systemic fatigue
increasing
so partial range of motion is probably
pretty similar on
rpe and systemic fatigue to full range
of motion but it probably exerts more
fatigue on joint
connective tissue so on the balance in
many many many cases
most cases for sure nearly all the
stimulus to fatigue ratio is better for
fuller ranges of motion so that's
another reason why full rom
is the default that you go to when you
start a new exercise whatever
because you're using less load and
because when you go through a full range
of motion with less load you're often
more stable and less likely to commit a
big technical error
the injury risk is probably less likely
with lower weights okay i've known a lot
of people who have squatted their entire
lives and all their joints are fine
because they've been doing proper
olympic weightlifting style squats and i
know lots of folks that have been doing
squats completely wrong with partial
ranges of motion tons of knee wrapping
and they end up saying oh squats hurt my
knees okay
so i'm skeptical and this is not a
research vetted finding
but i suspect this is why i say likely i
personally suspect that there's less
injury risk
both acute and chronic with the lower
weights used in full range of motion and
remember there's nothing
about full range of motion that
increases injury risk as long as you're
staying with an emotion
that that doesn't like super challenge
your connective tissues like you're not
pulling your elbow out of your
shoulder out of your socket then you're
good to go your body was in fact
designed to do that that includes
locking out your knees on leg presses
for example
lastly one of the benefits and reasons
for the default nature of full range of
motion
is that tracking is very easy with full
range of motion because full rom almost
always means standard rom
full rom in a pull up could mean pulling
up above your chin and then to a dead
hang
which is very easy to tell if you got
nine reps or ten reps or where you
failed
it's very easy to keep track if you do
partials on the bench for example
actually let's just stick to pull ups if
you do partials like
you sort of do pull-ups like in this
range right here and you say okay i did
nine pull-ups with a ten pounds hanging
off me
and the next week you want to beat that
pr how do you know what you're beating
because like the range of motion could
just be subtly different right and then
you're like well i did like eight this
time it was 15 pounds but my range of
motion was
a little bit bigger you're just guessing
the really great thing about full range
of motion is in most cases for most
exercises
full range of motion because it is full
means it's also standardized and that
means
it's very very easy for tracking so not
only is fluorine motion better at
stimulating muscle growth in many cases
not only does it stimulate less fatigue
but in addition that it's easier to
track and probably less injurious
boy oh boy is that a really really big
argument for fluorine emotion which is
why it's the default which is why you
should almost always do it but
there are at least four reasons why
we could move away from full range of
motion in some cases so let's examine
them and here is the case against full
range of motion
for specific cases number one you need
your training not exactly for
hypertrophy
you're using hypertrophy training but
you're training for specific lift
strength for example the power lifting
squat
if your power lifter working on
hypertrophy you can do full squats and
full hack squats online presses that's
probably a great
part for most of your cycle but some of
the hypertrophy work
could be squats to power lifting depth
because you want as specific of a
hypertrophy carryover
and for strength the full range of
motion is better really
makes much less sense for strength and
specificity
right for strength you train to where
you need now in in
interestingly enough there's probably a
little bit of a strength benefit from
doing more range of motion than less
on average a lot of that because you
gain muscle and boost your strength even
more
and it's more mechanical work it's more
challenge for your body
but fundamentally like if you're a power
lifter and you need to squat to depth
squatting much lower to depth is
increasingly a less valid argument
the lower you go so if your low bar
squat is something you can use for sets
of five to ten for hypertrophy and a
power lifting cycle it doesn't bother
you
i would probably just do it just below
parallel exactly how you need
so because people say like well i'm a
power lifter
should i hack squat leg press and high
bar squat all the way
to the bottom and my answer there is not
necessarily right so if i see a power
lifter who competes and meets
training his quads and when he does
hypertrophy workforce quads he only does
like for example leg presses to just
below parallel
then i'm like well okay that's fine
right i don't have a huge problem with
that
but if you're a bodybuilder you call
yourself a bodybuilder you've never
competed in powerlifting you don't plan
on competing in powerlifting
and you're cutting leg presses like that
i'm going to be very interested as to
why you're doing that and we'll get to
that very interesting part in just a
little bit
number two the target muscle in your
exercise of choice
is not the limiting factor to the
exercise thus it does not itself
approach close to failure and get
maximal stimulation
if and when you do full range of motion
so for example
if you're doing gee what's a really good
example of this
dips for your chest some people love to
lean into their dips with a slightly
wider grip
and do dips for lower chest they're an
excellent lower chest exercise
if you do them full range and lock out
your elbows every time
it turns into way more of a tricep
exercise than you want it to be
your pecs may never actually reach local
failure you may
fail at every set or get close to fail
and when you have to stop rir2 or
something
because your triceps are at rir2 your
pecs might be an rir5
and every time you stop because of your
triceps your packs are like
are we training it what the hell's going
on this is one long warm-up but
if you modify the dips to where instead
of coming out and locking out every time
every time you come up you just short of
lockout just short of lockout
then all of a sudden the pecs are
limiting factor it's a great chest
exercise
if that's the case then this is a very
good time
when partials are probably better than
full range of motion because
we don't want to turn full rom into a
religion the rom bro
why you cutting bro like if i ever
posted a video of dips on my instagram
and i wasn't locking out fully no less
than one trillion people would comment
like what the hell doctor mike i thought
you
loved full rom well i i love full rom
but i'm not
in love with full rom oh my god once
full rom was at my apartment and she was
like what are we and i'm like
listen baby i mean i think you're great
you know all the conversations are
fucking downhill after that but on a
serious note we're not religious about
full rom
we're not we know it's better in most
cases
because it has the higher sfr because
it's safer so on and so forth
when those things are clearly not the
case and partials are better objectively
we choose the objectively better choice
it just happens to be pretty rare right
so if your target muscle is not the
limiting factor and whatever it is
you're doing
usually change in exercise you should
have both full range of motion and the
target muscle learning factor
but if you knowingly choose a good
exercise with a really great sfr it's
okay to cut partial range of motion
as long as you're being honest with
yourself so there it is
point number three and this is a really
big one
if the stimulus to fatigue ratio of a
partial version of a lift
is just better higher than it is of a
full lift
then you should probably do the partial
at least consider it for example the
tension
to the target muscle is greater the burn
is greater when you're doing higher ups
the pump is better with partials
and the disruption is just absolutely
gnarly some people when they leg press
that last little bit of leg press
locking out is just kind of
doesn't do a whole lot and if they for
most of their sets
leg press to like 90 percent of lockout
and then come back down like all of
these things are just better
they get more sore their pumps are
gnarlier their burns are crazy the
tension perception of the quads is
awesome
then you know i would have i'd be
hard-pressed to be like why don't you
lock out your leg press
there's nothing wrong with locking it
out but if you get just better workout
not lock it out
that's probably a good thing and you
should probably consider doing that
in addition sometimes when people lock
out uh especially under
certain circumstances they may have like
a bum shoulder
uh for example my training partner
charlie sometimes his shoulder his left
shoulder hurts hilariously
sometimes my right shoulder hurts so
like if you put us together and then
copy to split us in half we'd be one
person with perfect shoulders and one
person with just dilapidated shoulders
but what ends up happening is sometimes
his shoulder my shoulder
will get really irritated on like the
upper part of pressing so a lot of times
what charlie does is he presses almost
to lock out and back down
i would never be like dude full run what
the fuck is wrong with you i would be
like dude why are you
not locking out he'd be like my shoulder
really hurts if i lock out it hurts
worse and worse every time i do that
well
well gee that's not good because on sfr
the joint stress thing skyrockets and
all of a sudden your stimulus to fatigue
ratio
just isn't that great in addition you
know rpe and systemic fatigue those
don't usually
change between lockout or not lockout
it's the joint stress that we're really
worried about so if you have an exercise
on which
partials of some kind just score better
on sfr then the partial wins and that's
the one that you probably use
it's rare that's that little third many
point sub point there
it's just not very common okay nine
times out of ten people are like i feel
it better this way it's like shut the
fuck up
you just don't want to train hard you
don't want to do for range of motion
because it's humbling so you have to use
less weight we'll get to that in a bit
but if it's honestly happening
it's a thing and it's a valid reason to
use partial ranges of motion
number four is when you have
complementary exercises in your program
so for example if i see someone during a
pushing workout let's say chest and
triceps
they're doing bench with no lockout for
pecs because they say they feel better
in their pecs that way and it doesn't
hurt their elbows sweet
i go okay i'm skeptical but we'll see
what else they do if
later they do partials from pins
full lockouts on close grip bench to
really hit the tricep and really tense
that lockout
and it hits the inner pecs a little bit
more because your arms are closer
together
but it's to pins so you're uh easier
it's easier for you to track it because
sometimes if you just do close grip
bench not to pins
like i don't know where i'm stopping it
starts to be hard to track but if you
drop it to pins and then press
and then pins and then press sometimes
you guys see that my chair is rocking up
and down
uh sometimes well you can say you can't
really accuse them of much
of saying well you're missing out on the
lockout in that bench like yeah i do
that later as a different exercise
okay you're missing out on the stretch
and the tension on the pecs they're like
yeah i just did that first like hmm
okay so it's really like you're doing
one very specific exercise and then
another very specific exercise
and when they overlap you get a complete
picture that's totally fine
that is absolutely fine someone could
ask
why not just do full range of motion on
both of those
and not worry about having to do
complimentary exercises just like
someone
says you know they get their protein
from beans and rice they're
complementary
and you could say why don't you just eat
chicken and not have to eat the beans
and rice and worry about
combining the right amounts but then
they would have to have another good
reason right which goes back to usually
number three
someone can say look when i do bench
without lockouts
for my packs it's better better sfr when
i do close grip bench
without uh going all the way down it's
better sfr and you say okay well that's
a valid reason and because you have
complementary exercises
we're not missing anything because if
someone says look it's better sfr
if i never go down all the way for any
of my chest and tricep work
it's like yeah okay i can believe you
but you might still be missing
some motor unit activation and the lower
part that the stretch has to happen
somewhere
but the point of point number four is
that if you cover
all the bases of all the functions of
the muscle the stretch and the peak
contraction
then much less of a sin and probably
totally fine to do
especially if you can track it really
well and number five
so i said there's four points here is
really just an explanation of the
previous four points if the majority of
your exercises and your program
are full range of motion and in if
it's not the majority but many full
range of motion and lots of
complementary ones that is you
whatever muscle you do you target both
the stretch and the contracted position
and everything in the middle
with complementary exercises then
any of these uh ones above are are okay
right like if you're gonna critique
someone's training you know you
probably won't have to critique them
that much if the rest of the program
because for example
if i'm watching a bodybuilder train like
dr mike what do you think of xyz
bodybuilder guys training i think it's
interesting but i think he does some
weird stuff
i'll watch the videos i watch him do
full squats full leg presses
and then leg extensions uh only like the
top
third because he says it really burns
the shit out of his quads now look like
if he was doing everything in the top
third i'd be like dude this guy's a
fucking moron
but if he's doing super deep squat super
duty black presses first of all he's
covering all the bases of stretch
and interestingly enough neither of
those exercises really tenses the quads
in a top extended position and and
doesn't tense the part of the quads that
have flexes the hip which leg extensions
do
so all of a sudden i'm like okay his leg
extension isn't a general quad exercise
that's not how he sees it
he sees an exercise specifically
designed to hit that part of the quads
that function of the quads
and if he says it has a better sfr he's
covering all his other bases because
it's mostly full range of motion
training he does anyway
so he's good to go i'm going to have no
problem with that training whatsoever
if i was this coach or if he was like oh
dr mike i've seen your youtube videos
you're a fucking scientist
what do you think about my training can
be like i would at least be like why
don't you do your leg extensions a bit
deeper and see how that feels
but if he's like yeah you know i used to
do that and it hurts my knees and also i
don't feel as much a pump in my quads
and i'd be like look
uh you know that's your truth and uh you
do you
but that is under the auspices of
with under the assumption that he is
still doing the majority of his training
with full range of motion and or
complementary range of motion
so there you go now what do we do about
all this because we have two competing
ideas first full range of motion is
great
second here's where it's bad how do we
synthesize this into really really good
training practice that makes sense
four part recommendation number one you
just
every exercise you do first you assume
it's gonna be full range of motion
until what is it innocent until proven
guilty right
assume for range of motion until you
have a really good reason not to do full
range of motion
now assess the sfr of every exercise
and especially once you're high-level
intermediate
more of an advanced lifter you can begin
to experiment with controlled
standardized as often as possible which
means like you measure the distance and
you know it's the same every time
partial lifting that you suspect will be
better in sfr
how do you do that you do bench presses
right and you notice
that the top part of the bench just
really feels like it's for triceps
you're doing them for pecs and you
honestly feel like tension is being
lifted off the packs and it's just a
waste of your time
so you it's not randomly that you go oh
partials might be better you're like
yeah man i feel like if i just stop at
the 90
pressing point it could actually be
better for my pecs as far as better
stimulus to fatigue ratio
and then try try that in a mesocycle at
least in a session
and if it delivers an sfr boost
use it but if it doesn't you'd be like
fuck that right i've done exercises like
oh i think this would be better as a
partial i'll try the partial i'm like
right and then other exercises to try as
a partial like holy crap i'm never doing
the full range of motion of this again
well
not never again you should try it again
to see if maybe some technique
adjustments to get the best of both
worlds
but assess sfr see if it works and if it
doesn't toss it out for a while and if
it does integrate it that doesn't mean
you need to be actively looking to
shorten your range of motion
because there has to be a suspicion
right like there has to be like
man i really feel like this part of the
exercise just doesn't help me much at
all
right it doesn't help me target the
muscle i want if that's the suspicion
feel free to try it especially if you're
intermediate or advanced
when you are intermediate advanced your
program will look like
mostly full range of motion moves but
some partials
will have benefits for inclusion
including mid-range partials
there may be some folks for whom
dumbbell pressing is best in a mid-range
under some conditions especially to
drive metabolites or something like that
mid-range partials are very very tough
to keep track of but you may have a way
of executing them
that is a little bit standardized or you
track all of your other chest work you
just add a set every time to this
mid-range thing or you go all the way to
failure
or something like that right you don't
need to track every single thing in your
program just the main basics
so if that's the case that's the case
but your program
should still be mostly based in full
range movements because it probably work
best
and the last thing i'll say is this
if and when you do partials for
hypertrophy
there had better be a good reason for it
so if someone asks you
why are you doing that okay you could
say my elbows hurt
that's a good reason you could say i get
a better pump this way and better
tension and stretch and all this other
stuff
sweet or you could say like i feel like
this exercise is really a little bit
better for my
triceps but i do tons of other exercises
where i go full range of motion so it's
not
a concern for me that's a good reason
right bad reasons
include the most common reasons for
doing partials folks by the way
9 out of 10 times you see a guy in the
gym doing partials they don't have any
of those good reasons they have the
following three bad reasons and many
others
one laziness like to quote my friend
michael zandelovich why would i want to
squat
that low i see people squatting low what
is it down there that i need so badly
right and you know when you put enough
weight on the squat you're like and if i
just cut the little
why would i go with you know it looks
painful it looks terrible why am i going
down there so a lot of times it's
laziness
a lot of times it's pain avoidance full
range of motion that's fucking painful
you know you're when your quads are
pumped and full of lactic acid
taking a deep stretch in a leg press is
awful
god awful flies terrible maybe you could
just have less pain and do partial
not a good reason and lastly by far the
most common reason that people do
partials
and the wrong reason is weight on the
bar ego
okay true full range of motion training
will
fucking humble you because you're not
nearly as strong as you think when you
have to do full range of motion it's
better for you in almost every single
way in almost every case
but it just doesn't feel like you can
slap five plates on the squat like you
used to be able to
somebody comes around they show you full
range and all of a sudden you're a 315
pound for rep squatter or you used to
tell people
you know five wheels bro well guess what
if you're in the gym
to grow muscle you do what it takes to
grow muscle not what it takes to make
you feel good in the moment yeah you're
in the gym to feel good but that's a
byproduct of you growing muscle
plus you don't want to become jacked and
you really have to examine what the hell
it is you want out of this life if being
jacked is not
among your top priorities folks thank
you so much for tuning in
get out there load a thousand pounds on
the leg press and do
1 8 partials see you next time
you
