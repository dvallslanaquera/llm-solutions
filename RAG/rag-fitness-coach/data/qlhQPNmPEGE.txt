do you see this right
here yes all you have to do is put your
hand on the tree anchored connected
grounded into the Earth guys grounding
is the biggest nonsense of all time it's
a literal makeb belief hippie
but I guess nowadays hippies come from
Texas and use a bunch of steroids that
are colored red who knew 2024 is a weird
time you can anchor connect in ground
into the tree that's grounded into the
Earth why don't you just touch the
skyscraper that's also grounded into the
Earth you stupid and guess what
that tree is probably not grounded into
the Earth it's grounded into that little
plot that stores its roots cuz it's five
floors of concrete beneath that too
motherucker maybe if it works through
your shoes and through a tree it can
work through concrete as well and also
it doesn't have to work because
grounding is not based in physics
reality it's just a
totaling lie I was going to say it's a
scheme but there's no upside to the
scheme at these schemes get you paid
grounding is just nonsense make
belief
