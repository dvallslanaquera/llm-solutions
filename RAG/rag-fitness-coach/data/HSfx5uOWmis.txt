hey folks it's dr mike for renaissance
periodization welcome back it's our
bullshit series i think i swore in the
first 30 seconds hopefully the algorithm
doesn't catch that
here's the deal today's topic
is gluten
and no gluten itself isn't bullshit but
what is it gluten is actually you know
it sounds scary and i'm sure you've
heard a lot about it before
is a type of protein found in wheat
that's it
what i thought it was toxic and coming
after our children here's the thing
gluten found in wheat
it is perfectly natural and there's not
some scary chemical additive made in a
big factory with the skull and
crossbones on the front of the factory
in a chemical sign and white on nuclear
radiation warning you know where diet
coke is made it's not of that it's
actually completely natural and found in
wheat and here's the thing to cut this
bs myth a bit of slack gluten
sensitivity is absolutely real formally
it's called celiac disease it affects
between one and two percent of western
populations
and
there is a potential though a very small
one for non-celiac gluten sensitivity to
be real now so far as far as i know none
of the larger studies have ever caught
this and a few of the larger more
well-controlled studies have actually
showed that most of the people if not
all
that think they have non-celiac gluten
sensitivity actually don't phenomenally
brilliant way they got to this idea is
they would give people food with either
gluten or not in it randomized and even
the researchers didn't know which food
had it was pre-labeled
and they would give them the food they
would eat it and then they would say oh
you know i'm definitely having a bad
reaction it's gluten and it turns out
that the people who said they had gluten
sensitivities
just as often said that the food without
gluten made them feel weird as the food
with gluten oftentimes real funny the
people that really said they had a
gluten sensitivity would eat the food
with gluten and they'd be like that was
great and they're gluten free right i
got absolutely of course
and uh nothing happened that's rough
that's a rough take if that's that's
really the case
then perhaps it's not a thing now that
could be a thing but it would be small
small thing would be rare on the order
of esra celiac potentially even rare
so that's the reality
how do you know if you have gluten
sensitivity or more formally and more
easily diagnosable because it's a
confirmed real thing how do you know if
you have celiac disease well here's the
thing
even a small amount of wheat product
tends to bloat you up like crazy like a
not funny amount of bloating
and it can give you unreal discomfort
real bubbly guts and in many cases it
leads to the runs aka diarrhea
that's a nasty nasty thing
people with celiac disease aren't like
yeah man if i have too much gluten it's
bad news lol they're like if i have
gluten this is bad things for many hours
afterwards i have to eat a purposeful
regimented strict diet with no gluten
now here's why i'm a little bit
one tiny reservation i have about making
this video
i have a few friends who have celiac
disease and they're really great people
and before they used to be very very
restricted in the kinds of products they
could eat because tons of stuff has weed
in it
ever since the big gluten scare that
started in like the late 2010s or sorry
the late 2000s into the 2010s and beyond
so many for lack of a better term cairns
thought they were gluten intolerant
there's this entire cottage industry
quite large of gluten-free stuff popped
up and my friends were all much happier
because they're like i can eat bread and
wraps and all this other crazy shit it's
now gluten-free because everyone's
scared they have celiac disease even
though they don't don't tell them so
sorry guys that you know truth comes
first uh i i do think some of the
gluten-free products are still you know
one to two percent is a very large
market and when you're exclusively
marketing to those people especially
with services like amazon and geez you
can buy all the gluten-free stuff in the
world so that's not really a problem
anymore which is a great thing
but
this whole group of people that think
they're intolerant of gluten and aren't
a lot of times they have a few
complaints some of these complaints make
actually no internal sense here's the
case in point
a lot of complaints with gluten and
people saying hey
i think i'm i'm going to drop gluten
from my diet i think i'm allergic to
gluten i think i'm sensitive to it
because i've just been eating all this
like pasta and stuff like that and i've
been gaining a bunch of weight hold on a
second
if you have celiac disease
you are less able to process both the
gluten and most of the other stuff that
was in your gi tract at the same time
which is why you flush all of it out
nasty like barely digested diarrhea
sorry i know sorry if you're eating
you're your fault now
and
this leads to nutrient malabsorption
this actually endangers the health of
non-managed celiac patients so that we
actually
the result if you have a gluten
sensitivity and you eat gluten still is
you will lose a profound amount of
tissue over time
amount of tissue that risks muscle mass
it risks your health so if you're gluten
sensitive and that's leading you to gain
weight
that and puzzle pieces don't fit
right it's like people same idea i'm
sure i'll make a video of this
eventually people are taking digestive
enzymes to try to lose weight if you
digest your food less
it goes through without being absorbed
you gain less weight if you digest your
food really well you gain all the weight
like if i see someone who weighs 600
pounds my last thing i think about them
is oh gee whiz you know they must have
digestive troubles they don't have 99
problems and they do have 99 problems
digestive trouble is not one of them so
with gluten it works the same way
people with actual gluten intolerance
lose weight from consuming gluten way
too much weight not the healthy kind so
if you're gaining weight you think you
have a gluten intolerance
one is at best not the cause of the
other
more than likely you're just fine with
gluten a lot of these stories and sort
of point number five in the slides a lot
of these stories uh come to us through
clients and folks in the fitness space
that'll say things like yeah man i think
i think gluten's all wrong for me like
oh how do you know like well
you know i was having pizza with the
kids and the husband last night and it
just got so bloated i got you
how much much did you eat like you know
it's friday night
go on
i had a few breadsticks
and a slice of pizza
after nine other slices of pizza and an
amount of breadsticks i stopped counting
oh i see you had 3 000 calories in one
meal and then you complained of bloating
and discomfort how strange right so a
lot of times this gluten business just
completely washes away
if you eat a very healthy very
well-balanced diet and you're still
wheat products only are really sensitive
to them that's something to look into
but that's almost no one and i literally
mean almost no one for the vast majority
of population for this reason for all
these reasons
cutting out gluten is just a gigantic
waste of effort for nothing you could be
eating delicious wheat there's tons of
stuff that's great that's made of wheat
including oh wait i only have to say one
thing pasta
pasta is like the final boss you can't
defeat there's no answer to pasta
because pasta is the best thing that has
ever been
rice yes rice is also good
but pasta
you know what i'm saying when you get
pasta on your plate at a restaurant
that's like the fucking kraken coming
out of the ocean that scene and uh
it's gonna say remember the titans a
slightly different movie clash of the
titans the new one which is sweet sweet
uh you know motherfucker took him like
10 minutes to even get out of the
fucking water that's how big he was
that's how scared you should be of how
amazing pasta is so if gluten is keeping
you the fuck away from pasta i don't
even know what to why come back to us
come back to us because thinking that
you have a gluten intolerance when you
actually don't is bullshit
see you guys next time
you
