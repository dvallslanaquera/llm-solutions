Dr pack here with Dr Milo wolf as you
can see from the no strip we just got in
a fight with 25 people who dared to
question their research how lengthen
partials and guy shot him from his car
probably those guys that are running
away haters but we are here with my good
pal friend and we outside the Mecha gyms
AKA generic commercial gy here in the UK
to take you through the most scientific
workout ever aka the full stack method
workout what does that mean I'll show
you inside the gym let's get
it all right guys straight in the lab
for the most science-based workout ever
the full stack method so what we're
going to do is go to literally every
stack loaded machine and try to rep out
the full stack for as many full and
partial reps as we have if we can not
rep the full stack we'll go slightly
lower now based on the latest meta
analysis by toal published in 2027 the
full stack method is a great and fun way
to get competitive with your male
counterpart or female counterpart train
CL to failure have a bit of fun and it's
pretty easy to just progress from one
session to the other cuz you're
literally using the full stack let's get
it and based on actual met analysis
we'll be trying to get at least five
reps per set if you get under five reps
per set the set isn't quite as effective
for hypertrophy so five partials five
full reps whatever we can get we will
get we'll go pretty close to failure
with a full stack every time it's just a
fun way to get effective training in
when you're not feeling it or when
you're trying to train with a Trad for
now and don't have to worry about oh am
I lifting enough load just do the full
stack get something in coms off and you
also have certain dominance in your
local gym so Mr cameraman will also show
you the surprised faces indeed of the
innocent bystanders watching us murder
these weights the thumbnail will go
crazy let's
do obviously you want to do some form of
warmup at least at the beginning of the
session or when you're warming up for
like let's say legs after doing Upp body
but after we're done like with ch first
and we move to the next offer bing
machine it may be that we won't need to
warm up as much so a couple of sets here
ready for the full stack and let's see
who's going to get more refs and whether
we can actually do the full stack the
real question is will we be able to get
the full stack done on every single
machine cuz I know for some machines up
here that are going to be challenging
say the least yeah at least let's find
enough all right guys this is it machine
number one one full stack let's
gock how many full stack that was 6 and
1/2 seven okay yeah okay I'm going to
get four no no you're going to get it
let's
see
easy I'm predicting eight or
nine he's good
nice
easy wasn't happening
there first stack repped chest machine
mugged onto what do you want triceps or
biceps Works your triceps triceps let's
do it second exercise pre- your tricep
extension full stock not a good machine
I'm too tall for it and how it goes
easy
extreme an absolute low back exercise
[Music]
have you ever seen somebody's tricep
[Music]
asleep let's
go eight traps felted all my abs yeah
phenomenal the full stack method
baby control
Ecentric
control nice
more control on the E entric let's
go there you go
control Ecentric let's
go beat me on this one horrible machine
maybe one of the worst machines in the
G nice machine though because you can
just full stack it time efficient you
get a set in and you're out every
machine is nice in that sense you know
the full stack method let's go all right
full stack let's see how many I get
aiming for at least five I'm saying
eight I'm saying like six I'm believing
that I believe in my brother let's
see
oh two easy look at that stack dancing
bro
easy and lengthen Parts as well do what
you preach oh
wow yeah after I do some full reps I
cannot get more length and partials like
most people can get a few length and
partial at the end of a hard set how do
you feel about losing all those gains
during that set the YouTube haters will
come after me after this video saying
look at that he's been doing four rang
of motion all this
time all right right full Stu
[Music]
control the East centry
here there you go all the
way
nice very nice let's go at least two
more
for
Greece gree crying right now 2008 all
over again 2008 all over again
nice mugged we are what two out of three
three on three let's
go next up we have one of those machines
where for most people you can full stack
it pretty easily this is one we commonly
do with a good doct pack and we often
get what like we can get we'll see on a
good day we can get some Reps for sure
let's see how we do let's
see what's interesting though is that I
never remember the actual numbers so
like this now says 91 kilos which we
could never remember no not even PhD in
sport Science doesn't mean you can count
you feel me that yeah cuz you know PhD
sport times online university they phds
but like when you see 91 you'd assume
who you can curl 60 with a like an easy
bar for reps which I don't think we can
I think we can 60 yeah I've curled 60 in
the past not strict strict but reason
strict okay but not 90 yeah not 9 no
chance three your CS it's
true all right let's do I'll
count zero no no no no still zero
I hope the viewers appreciate just how
many full range of motion repetitions
I've been doing throughout this just to
keep it consistent and so no one can
call me out for just doing partials and
therefore it doesn't count doing full
stack Let's do let's
do easy
one
2
3
four five
five six even full four
reps
eight all right let the pars begin
now nine nice partial as well that
F had to make up for that um that was
the hypertrophy yeah yeah plus 10%
exactly it was I about to say made up
for the minus 10% with a thck all
right Q motivational Montage I got eight
right huh I got eight eight yeah how bad
do you want it that's true I got to get
10 now Q male Eagle dude let's see two
excuses I train arms 3 days ago my
favorite pu out my inse security
three all the way let's go control these
pause
four right [ __ ] let's go five all the
way beautiful all the way down
control six all right control it let's
gool control
pause there we
go
okay look at that face the face of the
full sack method where you get fat bald
and you have a nasal strip nice though
you beat me here my first
W stick machines some are great some not
so much on this one to actually get a
stretch I'm going to be bending over
quite a bit most people can dip a lot
lower than this machine allows you to so
to make it even harder on
ourselves let's do
this if you don't have someone touching
your inner chest for example you have
someone touching in your chest when
doing flies how are you supposed to
train your chest is this here oh go are
you got to train tricep now the brain is
is remembering now thank
you all right see the dip thanks for
trying but you just got
mugged by Dr
Wolf m
push push push push push
push absolute takeoff I think the back
is heavier than me which without a seat
belt makes it pretty hard to stabilize
how much this stack it's 921 and it
feels heavier than me although I am in
fact heav than now I'm about my CH so
all right who needs wrists anyways am I
right
one more control more
control three bend over
more there you go
no four and over even
more
five there you go six
seven horrible nice though something
something but a bit of a hip flexor
exercise just to stay in position so
even for me where I'm 10 kilos heavier
wolf here Dr Wolf and shorter as
well I only yeah that
there that was okay like who designs
this like don't they test these cuz this
is Matrix right yeah this comes with the
seat belt so I'm not sure why they I
think I'm pretty sure it does like at
the one at um the gym Shout Out The Gym
better chain than pure gy does come with
a seat belt why remove
it I think we have met our match we
haven't tried yet but we're what 545 now
646 something we beat every machine this
is the converging shoulder press machine
AK the shoulder brush machine I doubt
we're going to be able to even move the
full stack we shall try though if we can
move the full stack we'll do one set
failure with a heavyweight just because
we walk the walk am I right
science let's go let's go let's
go
partials that's two reps three counted
or five okay five pounds I had a good
fight though it was it was a good fight
if I was a bit fresher I maybe could
have got fresh and
frustrated all
right avenge
me I must MOG the machine for my Fallen
brother very difficult though cuz our
shoulder strength is pretty much the
same and my shoulder is not the best
shoulder but I'm doing more range of
motion huh cuz I'm taller I started the
rep lower relatively shall I go lower no
you need to go higher higher should I go
higher go go one Higher yeah just one
setting so it's adjusting there you
go no chance and the shoulder is crying
we have been
beaten take a picture of the machine
this is the machine that beat
us check this out
I mean come on bro it's like we were
born yesterday God God this we can do
full stack and two different
exercises combo oh that's true watch it
happen
15 easy
four
five am I losing the bet again my friend
partials
now yes we all know you quit yeah again
the machine loses and we win all right
cheating the set up already
[Music]
let's bent arms
bro all right Branch
[Music]
[Applause]
Wen no strip doesn't count
bend your elbows even
more nice more than five machine
humiliated we have M the entire
commercial gym all I'm saying is
exercise variation important for
hypertrophy so why not just do all
machines for one set every set you know
I think outside the box put the bottle
on
deep all right let's see
God did easy oh what wanted a
citation you wanted some water yeah sure
oh yeah it's time to try the uh the rear
D look it's upside down notice the
weight oh yeah the last one is nobody
has even been to those depths
before until an Austrian Belgian and a
Greek SL British on paper all right
let's try this let's do no chance I'm
getting it but let's you're getting
you're getting it I'll try the cheat
grip is that the cheat grip no it's
worse but just just just give yourself
just go here so you can push against the
thing okay all right I
believe
jeret yeah that's not even mov it's
counting it's counting that was one long
one isometric at long muscle lengths
hypertrophy optimized there's nine
studies at the moment inde unpublished
plus 12 that I just made up adding up to
a total of 36 don't question math
this is for the
team for all of us like
this he's done
it two more let's go make the set
count last
one for
sence go hold it I shall hold
I cool all right am I doing are we
allowing spinal extension are we being
strict like whatever you do is going to
be strict enough do whatever you
like
obviously some range of
motion there's no chance if I cannot see
he's allergic to anything yeah
nice oh l
partials it counts bre three pass the
pass the thing pass it pass it pass the
yellow
thing all
right five reps martials achieved
hypertrophy maximize 10% extra you're
welcome very go
basically the same basically the
same this is one of those actually
impressive machines if you can full
stack it the Matrix L full down my
specialty but insert code we're deep in
the session sleep deprived but let's see
just Channel everything you've got the
haters are on the other
side yep that's not happening here's
your citation that's one
that's one [ __ ] imp
partial why Matrix light full down time
to meet your
makeup nice three more let's go
got two more
partials let's go last
one that counted as a draw Against the
Machine nice four
reps are you ready for the real
situation now are we doing that as well
yeah yeah hey we have to one rev is a
win yeah I'm not getting one Rev
let's go my love one RM
row look at that counts
B something take off you could argue
that was
something straps are for
losers who want to maximize
hypertrophy only thing I'm
maximizing is this machine
all right no
no nice stay out press don't need for
there go that's
it all right this is a personal favorite
it's a shitty machine but I can't be
asked to set the cable
sometimes all right is that the full
stack yeah
a it's this
easy proved my point it's been emotional
lateral raise you got
mugged after all of this uh full stack
mugging he didn't say what will happen
if he doesn't get 12 though will he be
sad let's see
three
four
five six
easy
seven once you look at that it's eight
reps
nine
10 15 11
easy full real control Ecentric I'm not
getting 121 get it now rest PA that's
done more do you hate yourself are you
not making enough money is the last time
you had sex yesterday night with
yourself well then I have the exercise
for you the leg extension ladies and
gentlemen okay stock no warm
up you think we're playing here leg
extension I don't even train legs my leg
training this week has been a single on
squats a single on
deadlifts literally losing muscle
no oh wow this is so effective for my
quads right
now I don't even train
legs it's super easy
though do you feel it mostly in your
knees no I feel it
full stack wed and the knee oh wow I
cannot breathe anymore back on ah
oxygen let's
see 20
reps with control
[Music]
that's for a good
story except I'll be done in like 2
seconds let's do
it how many n and a half five all right
full stack this is why let's go BR you
you should not leg pressure
more let's
go that's enough let's see it Milo
easy once you get in
moving
easy easy
five yeah sh is heavy look at that
length and bias there all the load is
there pausing in the the stretch
position more hypertrophy other
busws people hanging themselves right
now about length and portals for the
millionth time it's my job let's go to
Bristol to do
this nice though that's a solid
rep
two it counts trust me
might as well go some muscle kill me
okay let's
do hey almost touched let's go second
one hey good rep though let's
go two more got I reached the
M I hate SE Leos SE is so much nicer
though is it shout out my way colleagues
2022 seated versus L like call hamstring
study boom more hamstring
P let's
do
hey this is for the this is for that guy
that try to take a stop at my own leg
extensions we're curling your assisted
leg press 1 RM here big
man
oh
sure ah
this is St method baby
my is it I think
so all right all the way down let's go
there we go all the way back up control
all the way
down it
counts in Greek we have an expression
that says these ours these words as
in end of the session I
tried we got closer as friends and as
lovers the rumors are true cool Cales CS
that's it doctors no there is no Cals
actually the cal machine is broken shout
out Omar Yu nice where abs and then ab
ab downstairs let's quickly do this cuz
it's right here full stack no warm-ups
let's do one quick warm up cuz I'm
little
[ __ ] let's do one warm up I think this
is easily
mogg no stress whatsoever if I do this
machine properly I can do like a thir
those stack really I'm not going to do
it properly cuz otherwise I'm properly
so if you're actually trying to train
ABS you would focus on spinal flexion
and
extension and therefore you go kind of
like hyperextend your
spine the only way oh okay and do this
it didn't look as bad as I thought all
righty we stack it that is it we
rolling absolutely Grizzly it right
now are we going to lose huh are we
losing straight into it confus it confus
I have to EXT on that's okay where do I
put this here yeah just punch
down wow okay okay Vindication
Vindication let's
go could be this something some C if you
put it down it's going to be fa B easier
yeah no no no chance oh wow going let me
take the mic
off wow can't even move
it it's
jammed this might just be the hardest
machine in the gym that was extreme I've
never done this that's crazy I know and
doing it properly it's even horrible
respect for even doing the partial then
I know hell but keep in mind I
do cable crunches and obviously deadlift
heavy and squat somewhat heavy
frequently but wow has hard that was
hard man all right let's do it I'm going
to do the full
stock see how this goes
okay that's pretty easy
actually maybe I should have done the
usual full
one okay how was it that's all right the
peak contraction is the hardest part i'
see so the most important part of
course maybe I cannot do
it do we need some ad doct
training you can do
it ah easy actually yeah those get
easier where do he going now yeah I
don't know it was maybe because I
didn't done the warm
up this is what Squad and deadlift get
you
ah nice MOG not even a challenge all
right full
bled wow this feels awful the end of the
session as well the perfect
ending this happy
ending
sh I feel it all on my tailb here I'm
not sure why you why this is training my
tailbone right now but it's feeling you
can and you will tail boning
okay man relax with the authoritarian
government uh army recruit uh slogan
there all right [ __ ] let's do
it let's end the session the only way
deserves to be ended
mogged Grizzly reps Let's
Do
Lord I feel it here motion looks very
funny yeah that's why I said the grizzly
reps
check out map.com check sign up to be
notified when we make least tap please
proceed when we make a little money it
would be nice to make like a like a Milo
doll where you where you tap it and then
goes there's 25 studies on that and by
then there a 6 million
studies there you have it the full stack
method obviously if we're being serious
I'd recommend not
the full body YOLO fistic session as we
did but occasional meet up with your
friends want to play around with a few
machines go to failure full stacking
give it a go
[Music]
