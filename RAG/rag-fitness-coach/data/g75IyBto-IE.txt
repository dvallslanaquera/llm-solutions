so yesterday we trained with the first
ever men's physique mr olympia
mark anthony um he is actually
sort of on his little road to redemption
to competing again he's going to do a
classic physique debut
and i believe in november of 2021 he
contacted me shortly after
uh we i did nationals and i turned pro
he's actually commentating the show
and he reached out to me and asked if he
could come train with me and uh
mike dr mike isratel and we ended up
integrating a bunch of techniques
and and sparing a lot of his injuries
for him so he was telling about his
injury history and
how he had to work around it so it's
been really cool to be hands on with
mark and and see what works and what
doesn't
we've reduced a lot of axial loading
we've slowed down a lot of z centrics
fall into motion
good pauses so we went through a full
push session with mark
it'd be cool to you know see what he can
do with his legs maybe later on in this
little road to redemption thing but uh
this is all just really leading up to
mark's class of physique pro debut
and uh he was kind enough to get on film
with us
so tune in enjoy the rest of the video
and mike is going to
uh talk about the exercise selection
what he's doing rar
everything like that as we go through
the video
hey folks dr mike here i'm the hyper
sexy spotter in the back
watching mark's technique first exercise
here is smith machine bench
why smith machine no particular reason
just a cool variation
we're trying to get mark to focus on
lifting his chest up
towards the bar at the bottom and
pressing
all the way through the range of motion
notice his eccentric is
very controlled and he's gently pausing
every single time and no magic here it's
just a safe way to train it's effective
it allows you to count reps it allows
you to approach the right repetitions in
reserve
keep track of everything and add a
little bit of weight all reps
every single workout he is two reps in
reserve here
allegedly i don't know if we get it
right but we're trying our best
so next exercise is the high incline
dumbbell press
to put a great deal of emphasis on the
upper pecs
not so much or barely at all on the
lower pecs a ton on the front delts of
course and plenty on the triceps
great overall pushing movements you guys
can see me trying to get into the frame
to seem relevant because i have actually
no idea what's going on
turns out one of the better ways to do
this exercise is to make sure you get
nice and wide
to really open up your chest you're
trying to expose your upper chest
to stimulus which means a big stretch
and a big contraction at the top
notice slow on the eccentric doesn't
matter exactly where you touch down
not a ton do what's comfy but also what
makes you feel like you're working your
upper chest
a lot which can be very different from
lifting as much weight as possible
for as many reps get the feel right the
technique right and then
worry about weight and reps afterwards
two ir here let's see how mark does
he's really not interested in jared
pushing him along i think we all know
that mark always has a few more reps in
the tank there's some stranger
approaches us
probably to try to get free stuff
strange t-shirt is wearing and that's it
next up higher rep range i think the rep
range for this was like something around
20 reps you can tell us not a ton of
weight this is like a
a chest press machine we've been using
another one at another gym
we uh chose rather we're convinced to
come to this
fit club las vegas to do this it was
definitely an interesting place
interesting lighting i definitely didn't
have the fakest ass
in there and i was like one of the
fewest followed people it's an
influencer gym
in any case nice place you can see mark
is trying to get a
big big stretch at the bottom holding at
the bottom just a tiny bit to really
push that stretch in
ideally as flexibility allows you want
to try to descend below the level of
your chest
for that extra deep stretch yes it is a
somewhat closer grip
that doesn't necessarily mean the
triceps are working a ton more and it
doesn't mean the chest is working less
sometimes on machines like this a closer
grip gets you such a big stretch at the
bottom
that the chest ends up still working a
ton and notice this is a push workout
not necessarily just chest so we do want
some tricep involvement
mark did a really good job he really
pushed on that one it's a lot of times
very tough
to figure out what your rir is if you
don't have reps to match
from a similar machine which is one of
the reasons why i recommend using the
shame the same machine
week two weeks a week but if you're at a
different gym try your honest to god
vest
all right bicep curls on the machine
we're doing mile rep so we have a total
of 20 reps to hit
but it's probably something like his g
12 or 13 rm
on the actual machine so we did like 10
then we did like four then we did like
four so on and so forth
taking oh five to ten second breaks
between these little mini sets that's
what my reps are
really tough to do takes a lot of focus
and you can tell from his face
something's going on
very good training strategy to now and
again even consistently
as long as you progress properly always
always always as you approach failure
multiple times
make sure your technique is good we
never count reps towards the total
in which we're sacrificing our technique
you would think
that on a machine bicep curl you could
cheat the technique or you couldn't
cheat the technique rather because it's
fixed in
oh you sure as hell can i'm sure you
guys have seen that before notice
the general aura of the gym is still a
pleasant pink
and i have the skin tone of a newborn
piglet
[Music]
[Music]
machine lateral raises mom did them
grandma did them and mark anthony is
absolutely doing them super successfully
all the way to the top you can go to any
degree but probably
breaking that parallel is a good idea
otherwise you're probably just
half-romming it
and then notice he's squeezing the
eccentric all the way down
a lot of people get to the top of a
lateral raise and they think yay success
and they just let whatever weight
they're using dumbbells whatever machine
fall down
control the way up and then control slow
on the way down for maximum gains

if you're not masturbating with a high
enough volume intensity or frequency you
may want to do this exercise that mark
is doing here to
beef up your farms so when people look
at you in the street they go now there's
a guy that jacks off
a lot also notice off to the side of the
screen
how big my calves are getting holy crap
anyway back to the exercise mark is
doing a good job
these can be real easy to cheat notice
he's rolling all the way down to his
fingers at the end
all the way up for a big curl and quick
pause at the top
this is not about impressing anyone if
you don't feel this
big pump big contraction you're totally
wasting your time
he is a former olympian and he's using
the 35s
so your bitch ass well you could be
stronger than i don't know but in most
cases
35s 40s 50s those are heavy heavy
dumbbells for this movement
only do what makes sense only do what
you can get
a good stimulus out of and ideally you
have someone
over the top of you too lazy to stand
leaning over a bench
it looks kind of like an m1 abrams tank
and a triceratops had sex
also you're good god there's a lot of
pink in the background
and it's mark wearing pink or red we'll
never know because the coloring in this
gym
is like an 80s disco anyway folks that's
the last exercise
and mark is suffering painfully but it's
all for the purpose
of again getting the world's biggest
form so people think
that you're a masturbation addict peace
you
