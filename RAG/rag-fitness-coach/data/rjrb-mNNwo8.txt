paw it's like a it's like a tip drill
except not related to nelly or whatever
that means
it's a great that's a great thing google
that shit make sure mom's not around
it's x-rated sort of let's just start
working out shut up dr mike
[Music]
all right folks curls incline curls
charlie's gonna be doing seated curls
because his elbows bother him a little
bit doing inclines
my rep match which means whatever
number we get first like one or two reps
away from failed we are going to try to
match that with every single set
afterwards i'm doing four sets the guys
are doing like three
and uh yep so it's going to be like
night you know i'm gonna be doing like
18 or 19 reps then after a second set is
18 to 19 reps again maybe one or two
rest pauses in there three or four
seconds at a time what does that mean
watch hammer or normal so you can uh do
whatever's comfy i would say not hammer
uh at the top yeah at the bottom is fine
if you want but at the top regular
unilateral two bilateral bilaterals both
the same time
[Music]
yes except come up higher higher
oh oh so move my elbows
like that yes
big stretch at the bottom
and all the way up yeah very good
and it'll probably help if you get your
legs as close together as possible for
two reasons
uh one is you know dumbbell clear easy
yeah
and two is uh
you're married man close your legs
hey charlie come over here and look at
my veins come here
look at my veins look at my veins
charlie
you're so happy
who cares about veins when you got 40
pounders instead of 30s you pip squeak
[Music]
it's fun to see his hands hanging off
the bench too
because what the hamstrings are just
hanging oh
you can't see him from here
you look at your hamstrings shortly
your shoulders and hamstrings
most
important synergists yeah yeah
good shit charlie
yay
lead the first set
yeah you gotta look at the cameras and
do that
[Music]
hello
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that's good
that's really good
so juji we're doing something called my
rep match
so
rep match yeah
so you have another three sets left of
biceps you did 15 reps correct yeah you
can take little rest breaks that are
three or four seconds long dress pause
you correct but you have to get another
three sets of 15 reps
i kind of fucked myself then you did
that's why i didn't tell you before
it'll be a great bicep workout that's
why we're here
[Music]
[Music]
that's gonna be fun for you too
[Music]
all the technique
that's all shit everybody just should
have set mine honestly
so you can see the real shit
a real technique
i'm sorry mike you need help with that
i can hold it up for you
you let go of the bite now
[Music]
no
hey that's cool and all don't ever
fucking touch jared again though
i didn't touch him i touched his hoodie
continue i'm touching you so i get to
touch him one more time oh yes okay
but it matters where it matters where
let's go jared you don't have to flex
your calves but it's okay it looks good
see i'm making it funnier for you so you
don't do as many reps it makes it easier
downstream otherwise yeah yeah he's not
here for easy baby
[Music]
that was nice dismount by the way oh
good job great
this is a great exercise for everybody
at home watching this
yeah you can look at me it's good
because it's like
if this is the only exercise you get
and you only get three sets
how would you do them
to get the maximum pump
like this
basically like this now you get some
warm-up sets you know but
[Music]
breathe
relax
deep breaths good
[Music]
all right

big moves
so your calves are going to get freaking
huge if you flex them on every exercise
how do you think they got big goodness
god what look at this show them show
them show them
oh
jesus
this feels so good
[Music]
ah
don't you wish you could just put the
camera down and come out here and take a
pee
i bet you gotta pee too
sound a waterfall make you want to pee
[Music]
laterals here super rom style
a little bit more forward a little bit
more back doesn't really matter much as
far as muscle activation to any
meaningful degree but it can feel much
better to do one of the other so do
whatever it does on your shoulders
and here we're doing my rep match sets
so
i'm personally going to be doing four
sets
the first one is whatever reps i get
last week i got 18 so the goal this time
is 19. and then the other three sets are
19 but with as many rest breaks as
needed
brutality
