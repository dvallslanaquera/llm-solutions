hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization the last
and final video of healthy eating made
simple
number eight living in balance
the last video we covered how to execute
a maintenance phase
to maintain our lost weight after a
dedicated weight loss diet to become a
little bit more healthier
now we're presented essentially with two
possible options
choice number one is after we finish the
maintenance phase we're stabilized
physiologically psychologically if
needed or
desired we can do another round of fat
loss dieting
per video number six instructions
totally fine and then another
maintenance phase
and then the choice is presented again
choice number two however
if we're at a body weight and a body
size we like and is in the healthy range
we can enjoy our new healthier body
weight for a long time to come
with no immediate plans of weight loss
ahead there is no correct choice here
both are totally fine having a chat with
your medical doctor with your primary
care physician is probably a good idea
after the last maintenance phase you've
done
to see which way the doctor thinks you
may need to go so if you start at 350
pounds and i are down at
290 maybe a few more fat loss phases
weight loss phases
are in your future maybe not now but
maybe at some point you know if you
started at
170 and you're now down at one you know
45
gee you know if you're of certain height
most tights probably
there's no impetus health wise for you
to lose any more weight and maybe that's
not the choice for you now
we already know choice number one which
is to lose more weight works
really well you just repeat videos
number six and seven from the series
back to back
until you're at a weight you like now
let's take a look at choice number two
which is enjoying the new healthier body
weight for a long time to come
and we call that living in balance okay
that term is you know very
general terms and what does that
actually mean it sounds nice it sounds
very hippy-dippy
so what are we balancing specifically
with here's four
sort of recommendations of how to do
this properly
first living in balance living means a
long
term means doing consistent and
fun physical activity you can keep doing
for a long time
sustainable right now resistance
training in some ways highly recommended
but not mandatory
but if you can keep doing this it's a
huge boost to your health
and a great way to stabilize your body
weight and prevent it
from slowly scooting up on you number
two you eat a predominantly healthy diet
with all the stuff you've learned in the
series
videos one through five extensively
describe what that actually looks like
if you need the review number three
you're living in balance not as a robot
so some whatever meals here and there
are totally fine they can be a little
bit junky or a lot junky
they can just be more of the healthy
good stuff no problem either way you
slice it
you can track macros for those meals if
you really like
but if you don't track macros no big
deal at all it's totally a personal
choice
now during this phase you might check
your body weight maybe only every two
weeks or so
and if it's a bit on the high side let's
say you got 245 pounds
and then after you know two weeks it's
still around 145 two weeks is still
wrong 45 and you sort of go on holiday
vacation
cruise ship so on and so forth you come
back and it's 148.
yeah it's a little high for me what you
do is you just switch
to a little bit less junk mostly healthy
foods really sort of tighten your intake
up a little bit for a couple of weeks
check it again and rock on as usual if
it's back under or within that range no
problem
right so it's sort of an auto correcting
thing
losing a significant amount of weight
requires really a lot of effort
bringing weight just back down from it
rising is super easy
so remember that you don't have to do a
dedicated months long fat loss diet if
you've gained three or four pounds
you just have to rein it in make it a
little less junky maybe reduce the fats
and carbs just a tad
in a couple weeks you'll be back to
normal and you can reintroduce all that
fun stuff that you like to eat
now if you feel great and if your
clothes are fitting well
you don't have to check body weight at
all if you don't want to people go years
without checking their body weight
because when they're physically active
and eating mostly healthy
they check in they're like oh weird i
lost another five pounds because i
started
mountain biking or something so it's not
absolutely not the case
that if you don't check your body weight
it's magically gonna creep up on you
it's the actions that determine the body
weight
if you're eating healthy if you're
highly physically active and you feel
like
you weigh the same amount because you
know look in the mirror and you see how
your clothes fit you feels fine you
don't ever have to check your body
weight you don't have to be obsessed
with that stuff at all now on the other
hand
it's totally fine to check your body but
if you don't want as long as you have a
healthy relationship with it
it's just a tool to tell you something
it's not a religion
now the big thing is to keep that core
habit
of a high level of physical activity a
consistent one
and fundamentally eating well if you
have to have a meal and it's not a
celebratory meal or a super fun meal for
some reason
and you reach for the good stuff and you
already know how to do that from the
other series you know how to build a
meal
then that is along with physical
activity that's going to 90
uh 95 times out of a hundred just keep
you at a healthy weight
and at your healthiest for essentially
infinity right
if you're on average every time you
reach for a meal
you reach for crap and physical activity
is something you never
really got married to and you hate it
and you always fall off the wagon you're
going to continue to struggle it's these
core values of high physical activity
and fundamentally good eating doesn't
mean everything you eat is good but
mostly
that's what's going to keep you in the
game if you do that you're nearly
guaranteed
awesome health for decades to come
here's the thing
at the end of the day life is for living
if you need to lose some weight get it
done
using videos number six and video number
seven from this series
and then live it up in a normal awesome
balanced way
no value judgments give this some
thought if you'd like some more
information
we have a book called understanding
healthy eating it's on the rp website
it'll be linked in the description below
and you can learn a ton more about the
details of everything you learn through
this series and
if you want an app that helps you plan
and execute
and coaches you through a really healthy
intake to lose some fat or to gain some
muscle whatever
the rp diet app available on the google
play store
and itunes super good idea i helped sort
of design that app so of course i'm a
big fan of it you don't have to use it
there's tons of other great tools
we also have the simple diet templates
on the rp website you can print them up
put them on your fridge they're really
easy to read so if you're more old
school give that some thought
folks three cheers to your long-term
health and i'll see you for the next
