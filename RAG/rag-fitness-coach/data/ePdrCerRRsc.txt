repetition tempo is probably one of the
least thought about variables in a
muscle building program
repetition temper refers to the duration
you perform the various muscle actions
in an exercise as a random example
you could perform an exercise with a
three second eccentric phase
zero second isometric and a one second
concentric phase
i recently came across research
exploring if repetition tempo
could impact regional muscle growth in
other words
could different repetition tempos
produce different growth on parts of a
muscle
this could make sense it's possible that
performing an exercise with a faster
or slower tempo could activate different
regions of a muscle more so than others
resulting in different regional
hypertrophy indeed
erp and colleagues compared heavy
parallel back squat training
using a 75 to 90 one rep max load
throughout the study
to jump parallel back squat training
using a 30
watermax load for a regional growth of
the quadriceps muscles
the jump parallel back squats were
performed very far from muscular failure
meaning they were just explosive jumping
repetitions whereas the repetitions for
the heavy parallel back squat
would have been substantially slower as
they were training closer to muscular
failure
heavy parallel back squat training
produced greater upper region growth of
the vastus lateralis
and vastus intermedius compared to jump
parallel back squat training
however jump parallel back squat
training resulted in greater lower
region growth of the vastus lateralis
and vastus intermedius given range of
motion was controlled between the groups
they both squatted to parallel
repetition speed was probably the reason
for these differences in regional growth
now this study did compare strength
hypertrophy style training
to power style training what about the
use of different repetition tempos
in typical strength slash hypertrophy
training programs
denis and colleagues split 44 untrained
women
into one of four groups a five second
concentric
one second eccentric group a one second
concentric
five second eccentric group a
three-second concentric
three-second eccentric group or a
control group
the control group of course did not
train
and experienced no gains so we won't
mention them any further
the three training groups performed the
knee extension
for sets of six reps with a fifty
percent warner max
load and 180 seconds of rest between
sets
three times per week for ten weeks weeks
one
and two had the subjects perform three
sets per session
weeks three and four four sets per
session and weeks five to ten
five sets per session the five second
concentric
one second eccentric group performs a
knee extension with a five second
concentric phase
and a one second eccentric phase with a
one second concentric
five second eccentric group performs a
knee extension with a one second
concentric phase
and a five second eccentric phase
the three second concentric three second
eccentric group
performs a knee extension with a three
second concentric phase
and a three second eccentric phase
the cross-sectional area of the rectus
femoris vastus medialis
vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius
was measured at 30 50
and 70 of the thigh length
at fifty percent of the thigh length for
the rectus femoris
the five second concentric one second
eccentric group
and one second concentric five second
eccentric group both experienced similar
but statistically greater increases
versus the 3 second concentric
3 second eccentric group there were no
other statistically significant
differences
however looking at the overall data
there potentially could be some other
practically meaningful differences
at seventy percent of the thigh length
for the rectus femoris
increases seem to favor the three second
concentric three second eccentric group
versus the other two groups
at thirty percent of the thigh length of
the vastus lateralis
increases seem to favor the five second
concentric one second eccentric group
versus the other two groups at thirty
percent of the thigh length for the
vastus intermedius
increases seem to favor the one second
concentric five
eccentric group versus the other two
groups
at fifty percent of the thigh length of
the vastus medialis
increases seem to favor the three-second
concentric three-second eccentric group
versus the one-second concentric
5-second eccentric group
finally at 70 percent of the thigh
length of the vastus medialis
increases also seem to favor the
three-second concentric
three-second eccentric group versus the
one-second concentric
five-second eccentric group it is
important to note that as these
differences were not statistically
significant
we should be cautious here the observed
percentage differences
may just be sampling error nonetheless
given there was one statistically
significant difference between groups
this study does suggest different
repetition tempos can produce different
regional growth
a noteworthy limitation of this study
was all three groups trained the knee
extension
with sets of six reps using a fifty
percent wanna max load
due to the differences in repetition
tempo between groups
they would not have been training in
equal proximity to muscular failure
during typical exercises such as the
knee extension
you are limited by your concentric
strength with all else equal
so the reps unload as was the case with
all three groups
prolonging the concentric phase would
make the exercise more difficult
therefore the five-second concentric one
second eccentric group
would have been training the closest to
failure followed by the three second
concentric
three second eccentric group and then
the one second concentric
five second eccentric group this could
have confounded the results
perhaps some of the potential
differences between groups were actually
a result of differences in fatigue
however remember at fifty percent of the
thigh length for the rectus femoris
increases were statistically greater for
the five second concentric
one second eccentric group and one
second concentric
five second eccentric group versus the
three second concentric
three second eccentric group the five
second concentric
one second eccentric group and one
second concentric
five second eccentric group would have
been experiencing different levels of
fatigue
yet they experienced similar hypertrophy
at this region
and both greater than the 3 second
concentric 3 second eccentric group
indicating fatigue was probably not a
factor here
rather it seems repetition temper was
the reason
let's move on to another study by
pearson and colleagues
13 well-trained men with at least three
years of training experience
and could squat an average of two times
body weight had one leg assigned to a
fast eccentric condition
and their other leg assigned to a slow
eccentric condition
they trained each leg on the unilateral
leg extension
twice per week for eight weeks the leg
assigned to the fast eccentric condition
performs the exercise with a one second
concentric
and one second eccentric duration the
leg assigned to the slow eccentric
condition
also performed the exercise with a one
second concentric
but they used a three second eccentric
duration
from weeks one to four three sets with
an eight to ten rep max load
was used for each leg per session from
weeks five to eight
four sets with an 8 to 10 rare max load
was used for each leg
per session as a note they alternated
which leg was trained first each session
thickness of the anterior thigh which
included the rectus femoris and vastus
medialis muscles
was measured for both legs at 40 percent
and 60
of the thigh length increases at 40
percent of the anterior thigh
was similar between both the fast
eccentric condition
and slow eccentric condition however
increases at 60 of the anterior thigh
was statistically greater for the fast
eccentric condition
therefore this study suggests that one
second eccentric duration on the knee
extension
preferentially stimulates the vastus
medialis and rectus femoris at 60
of the thigh length supporting the idea
different repetition tempos
may induce different regional growth
to sum up we do indeed have some
evidence different repetition tempos
can influence regional muscle growth
that said
only two of them evaluated repetition
tempo during standard strength slash
hypertrophy training styles
so it isn't overwhelming evidence
however
if you were to use a variety of
repetition tempos in your training
program
at the very least muscle growth should
not be harmed
a meta-analysis by schoenfeld and
colleagues found that so long as reps
were performed too
or close to muscular failure probably at
least two to three reps away from
failure
repetition durations ranging from 0.5
seconds
to 8 seconds produces similar whole
muscle growth
and at best as we've seen different
repetition tempos may induce different
regional growth
resulting in more uniform muscle
hypertrophy i think this is quite an
interesting area
i hope more research eventually comes
out here if it does happen
i definitely plan to make updated videos
