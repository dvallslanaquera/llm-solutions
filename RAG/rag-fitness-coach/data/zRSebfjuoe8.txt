oh mama mia it's good to be back dr
james dr mike it's the weekly webinar
you got questions most of the time we
have answers dr mike how's it going
we have attempts and answers that's for
sure and we try
it's there's an effort put into it all
right
first stop oh crap
you good yeah
gill hair may what the f
i'm not god damn it can you screen share
yours
i closed mine uh uh
screen share
i always got to check to see if my horn
tabs are
loaded or not of course they wouldn't be
why would they be
can you see the screen yeah we're good
okey dokey guilherme
says or asks hey docs how to program for
hamstrings mobility slash flexibility my
mobility is so bad i can't even move
the barbell to my knees and sldls james
said that stretching
followed by weighted training with full
rom and exercise i guess i'll deals good
mornings
back extensions and bent over rows are a
good idea but how do i program for
flexibility
what frequency rep ranges work better
how much volume and stretching and
weight training how many
rir thanks docs james
all you my friend yeah so gil jeremy um
so i think there might be a little bit
of confusion so first off
the weight training stuff you just do
that as you normally would so we're not
going to do anything necessarily
differently
in terms of sets frequencies volumes rar
that's all normal and then those are
just particularly good exercises that
really emphasize the range of motion in
like the hamstrings and that hip hinge
movement
so that's just a good a good choice in
terms of like
increasing your flexibility over time
with a lotus stretch so
from that we say okay just do that
normally you don't have to do anything
crazy with that
usually what we recommend with
flexibility is more of a kind of a
frequency stimulus
less on the um like super intense and
super voluminous stimuli right
so with flexibility this is one where it
definitely tends to benefit from
frequent exposures
and has a really really rapid
deconditioning rate meaning like if you
don't do it then it just goes away
really fast so usually what we recommend
if for somebody who's really trying to
become more flexible more mobile
any combination of those you might want
to choose an ex more extended
active warm-up than what you normally
would do and this is a good time to
incorporate some dynamic stretches so
not stretch and hold
but stretch through full range of motion
kind of like your your high kicks your
toe touches kind of stuff so
do your normal warm-up and maybe add
somewhere between i would say five to
ten minutes of just
active uh dynamic stretching as part of
your warm-up before you move into your
actual
training activities then you can go and
do your training which is going to if
you pick movements like the ones listed
in your question
those are great those are going to start
slowly but surely
having that loaded stretch and
increasing your flexibility of the
actual
muscle tissue over time not just your
tolerance to it but the actual
pliability of the tissue so that's
really good and then in your
kind of down time i recommend adding
anywhere between you know like
five to 15 minutes of static stretching
you know i would say four to five times
per week and this isn't something that's
meant to be done
excruciatingly painfully it's not meant
to be like
a super big part of your day this is
something like stretch and hold for 30
seconds
per repetition take a break do a couple
reps maybe pick another movement rinse
and repeat the same thing
go from anywhere between you know i
would say 10 minutes is usually a good
place to start
and if you do that four or five times a
week between like the active warm-up
the choosing the range of motion
emphasize movements and then having a
static stretching kind of routine
somewhere throughout the day
you will notice your flexibility
increasing rapidly though the key here
is to do it consistently and don't just
fall off the wagon
excellent excellent answer
all right do you want are you going to
bring it up john james or do you want me
to just keep
i had i can i can bring it back i cl i
had something i didn't want to share up
so i closed it
oh no worries that's half of imagine
half the time what am i even doing ah
i'm scatterbrained right now
okay i'm gonna pull it up if you want to
do the the next one in the meantime
totally so i'm gonna highlight it
and then i'm going to screenshare it
oh thanks for annihilating it
who has stolen our rp logo thanks a lot
we'll be filing a claim against you it's
okay his used to be just my face
so he's moved on to more general cyborg
style the borg style acquisition
he says hey docs i'm really starting to
coach myself increasingly better since i
read the book awesome
one question though for a person who is
not planning to compete
how to plan a whole block of training is
there an optimal mass
cut to mass ratio of months of the year
say i start messing around 12
body fat up until 17 and then cut to
roughly 10 afterward for a better p
ratio then do a mass mini cut
at a second mass to uh 15 to 17 percent
again
that should take up around 17 months
with maintenance phases
is this too much yearly stress on my
body shifting uh
[Music]
by shifting weight so much no i don't
think it's like as long as you're
massing slowly
and you're cutting at the you know
rapidly but not excessively
don't cut faster than one percent body
weight per week mass no faster than half
a percent of body weight per week
something like 0.25 to a half percent
make sure to take maintenance phases
when you have high fatigue
and you're good to go and it's just that
cyclical process um
you can throw mini cuts in there if you
want a pretty good outline of like
long-term periodization
the mini cup manual has a really good
one in there in addition to that
um the renaissance diet 2.0 has a good
little talk about it
other than that it's pretty
straightforward so uh
that's it yeah it's you you sound just
fine uh
some new updates to literature and
interpretations especially by eric
trexler
the p ratio pie doesn't change much or
at all anywhere i would say between 10
and
uh 20 is my best guess just not much
difference
so where you choose to end your mass
is really more of like how lean do you
want to be on average
um you can go as high as 20 in the low
20 and just totally fine
i would go any higher because you get
like permanent fat deposits that fuck up
your skin
fill with water when you're trying to
lose fat and fucks you up but
you can from from 10 to 17 is or 15 to
17
that's a long time of massing so that's
really good
if there's nothing wrong with that at
all yeah good answer and it's also kind
of reinforces
like you don't have to be fat phobic
when you mask like you can get up to
like
you know kind of chunky and still be
having pretty
pretty good gains which is great um i
actually had a point that i was going to
bring up but that got me distracted
oh right so the question was like if it
was too stressful so typically for most
people
that kind of regiment as mike said is
pretty much right on point in terms of
like physical stressors really the
i think the dividing line for most
people was the psychological stressors
of having to go through that much rigor
and fuss with your training and diet
stuff all the time some people just need
a little bit of a break and as mike said
you take maintenance phases and some
active rest when you
are starting to feel the wear and tear a
little bit you go from there so i would
say monitor your psychological stress
like see how much
um the diet and training stuff is
interfering with your lifestyle and if
you find that the
compromise is becoming too great just
take a break from it every now and again
that's great henrik
anderson pulled up here now henrik
anderson is
next got it
so he asks question about per session
maximum adaptive volume
for synergistic muscles like biceps
during back training
what happens to the per session maximum
adaptive volume if i were to do
12 sets of back what about biceps i
can't train my biceps this workout
without exceeding per session mav
can't i train my biceps workout but
exceeding prescription med
uh and then he says edit super quick
question
um well just one question at a time
hendrix i'll answer your first one
um so
the thing about back training and biceps
we just take the average back exercise
each set of back may contribute
something like a third or a fourth of a
typical set
of hypertrophy stimulus to your biceps
versus a direct bicep curl
so you could do like four sets of
pull-ups and you could do one
set of bicep curls and it would be
roughly the same
hypertrophy to your biceps something
like that because
you know back workout isn't directly
stimulative to your biceps
it is also usually not limiting factored
by your biceps
so like your back tends to give out
first especially at the very length and
position when you're stretching your
lats like
your biceps are fine your lats give out
um so being that that's the case
after 12 sets of back you may be in a
position where you have roughly three
sets of biceps stimulus
is that your maximum adaptive volume
probably not
you know you could do another several
sets of biceps and get close to what is
your mav it could be your mev
which is why if someone trains back
pretty hard and pretty frequently
sometimes they can get away with minimal
or no bicep training and still keep
their bicep size
but if you want your biceps to advance
then
you may want to do a few sets of biceps
after that now i do
there is a problem with your sort of
ineffective a systemic fatigue
by then so what you might actually want
to do
is come in another time during the week
another session and train biceps more
fresh so they get higher quality
stimulus
and then you could say well what about
all that the bicep work that i get from
back doesn't it kind of
um over the week still sum up it
absolutely does which is
basically sums up low quality work and
plenty of fatigue for your biceps
so if you really want the biggest biceps
possible the question is should you back
off on back training and the answer is
absolutely you should because
back training makes your biceps tired
and doesn't grow them nearly as much set
percent fatigue for fatigue than it
could
so if you really want the biggest biceps
you could possibly get but you weren't
worried about your back so much for the
short term
you should absolutely do not much back
training and do a lot of biceps training
so that's my best answer james yeah that
was really good and then i'm just gonna
go a slightly different route but more
or less the same answer as dr mike here
um
i think this is one of those things
where you can be overly rigid and overly
mathematical with your pre-planning
approach where you go okay
is it a third for every back is that my
what's my mav
the answer is set progression algorithm
right do those things
see what the pump is see what the
disruption is see what the mind muscle
connection is
go from there right so what you might
find is that um
your set progression algorithm for
biceps might be distinctly different on
different movements throughout the week
when you train them separately so you
might find like when you start with
biceps
you your sessions go a little bit
differently than when you start with
back
and that's perfectly fine and so that
set progression algorithm will help you
get
generally at least pretty damn close to
your mav every single time regardless
regardless of whether or not you're
carrying a little pre-fatigue from some
of the other work that you're doing
so it's kind of hard to say like is it x
y or z like how many sets should i do
you just that's when auto regulation
just takes over and you have to just
kind of take some of your pre-planning
and say this gets me in the right
general vicinity auto regulation gets me
exactly kind of where i want to be and
the way that you use that in this case
is the set progression algorithm that we
talk about boom
excellent yeah because you could do
eight sets of back
and then one set of biceps after and be
like dude toast
like they're already pretty fucked up
and pumped now just one set later i'm
done
or you could do eight sets of back and
find that it takes you six sets of
biceps to get the job done because
you're so systemically fatigued
you can even get a good bicep workout
and then you're like man i should
probably just split these up
or you do eight sets of back and then
just four sets of biceps later your
biceps are toast everything's good to go
so there's kind of three general options
that could fall into
like james said you just have to watch
the algorithm uh are you
getting all of the pumps and burn and
everything else that you need if not
you have to adjust by training in a
different sequence or doing more or less
volume
folks there's a reason why we write
these things down
yeah so then you can go and do them read
that it's in the book
bam how about that this is the best part
about after we release a new book
product because then we can just say hey
read the book
it's like the most shameless of
shameless plugs
yeah like we actually wrote a whole book
about that um all right
so um
harsh panoir got it
there he is so harsh pawnwa
asks what the fuck where am i oh there i
am
hello docs i hope you're doing well i
wanted to know for someone interested
solely in building muscle strength
how important is increasing flexibility
slash mobility
um and improving posture for that matter
given the person's current flexibility
mobility are not extremely bad
so really simple answer for me and i'll
james take
the floor is you should start training
as well as you can as soon as possible
for strength and hypertrophy
and then slowly over time if and as your
your mobility flexibility and posture
get in the way of you getting as much as
you can out of the movements or start to
hurt you to some extent
then you need to slowly and marginally
put work in to making them
as good as they need to be to free you
to be able to have high
sfr movements as long as you can have
high sfr movements
you don't need to work on them any more
than that so for example my squat
i can maintain a completely tight lower
back and go all the way down
i don't need any more flexibility
because it would be completely
superfluous and giant waste of my time
if you can't squat all the way down your
back tends to round then you should
still squat as deep as you can
for as long as you can squat that deep
but over time have a plan developed
similar to the one james just described
for um
for guillerme our first question asker
you should have some kind of plan like
that to get a little bit more mobile and
flexible
posture is mostly fucking giant bullshit
myth
uh people that are hypochondriacs like
to spread james
take it away yeah so dr mike nailed it
the key word here is
need right so if you grew up like mike
and i did in like the 80s and 90s
you might be under the impression that
running is the cure for all
ales right and we know that that's
really not quite as true as we used to
think and
at the current time it seems to be that
flexibility and mobility is that same
kind of notion where all of your
problems
stem from a lack of flexibility or
mobility dr mike and i
and i tend to think that that is also
not true you have to prove that there is
a need and that need means that
your flexibility mobility or postural
limitations are holding you back from
performance that you could otherwise
achieve
and so what we find in for strength in
particular
how much flexibility mobility do you
need not much
i mean as much is enough enough to do
the movements that you want to train
which
most strength movements not a ton so
that's easy
um posture there's pretty much no better
way to
generate good posture than strength
training i can't really think of a
better way frankly so that one's just
right out the window
and then you move into things like
hypertrophy training and then as mike
said
really the only case that you would make
for any of those
is can if i improve my flexibility
mobility can i generate higher sfrs on
some of the movements
perfect example is kind of like
guillerme asked about the stiff leg of
deadlifts and good mornings
i probably could get a lot more out of
these movements if i was just a little
bit more flexible i could do a little
further range of motion right
now you have presented a case where you
said there is a potential need
or at least improvement to my training
by adding this in and i can make a case
for
doing it but if you say um kind of at
the end of the question you say given
the person's current flexibility
mobility is not extremely bad
well then to me that sounds like there's
not a need for it so why not focus your
attention on the hypertrophy training
and or the strength training that you're
doing instead until a need arises
boom
that was really good what is such a
we're good at
that is such a command i tell you what
unfortunately this question
answer will be lost in the algorithms of
youtube but it's fun we're gonna
keep getting all the time up i've got a
video coming out real soon on the rp
channel on this channel huh um that's
directly talks about like
do you need mobility for hyperscreen
work and it'll answer all that stuff in
detail
but like it's something that james how
long have you and i've been doing
seminars
it's like every time it's asked and it's
it's almost like people think there's
this thing that is like
they're doing wrong and it's really
keeping them back and like see that if
you pro bodybuilder like yeah like
he got a mobility program broke up his
adhesions and now he's 280 with veins
like
that is not how it works at all and
people just think it is
i've uh so i'm a big fan of the michael
bisping podcast and
one of the ads that they have now is the
kelly sterett app
which is like the mobility coach app
sure
man so crazy right and like i said like
um we're at a time
for yeah so i can think of a couple
three distinct and actually one of them
is still kind of lingering around so
running was like the fix all in the 90s
yep you just run to get in shape
right it doesn't matter what kind of
shape yep exactly you got to run then it
was core
training and core training is still kind
of lingering around a little bit but
people are kind of at least
key into the fact that it's not a fix
everything kind of thing but the
flexibility and mobility training is
kind of the current thing right now
where
it's just a blanket assumption right and
i don't want to sound like conspiracy
like
trumpistan kind of person but there's
like a there's like a
a media the media puts out this idea
that this is what you need to do to fix
all your problems and they make a
blanket statement and they just
there's really no evidence to suggest
that most of that is true now there are
instances where
that can be true and can be useful but
they just kind of put it out there like
of course your problem is flexibility
mobility duh
don't you know you're like okay i'm not
sure about that actually no
um real quick off topic but on
one of your passions dude how about
fucking michael chandler huh
oh man what a great pay-per-view i i was
really furious so like i don't know if
anyone else has this problem but
i love the fact that i'm gonna get to
michael chandler but i have a side rant
about that
so once they switched over to espn plus
it's great that you can order the stuff
on the platform and you can watch the
replays but for whatever fucking reason
every time you order it
you go through about 20 to 30 minutes of
rigmarole before you can
watch it just won't it just won't work
it just like has all these errors and it
just won't work
so ours always pops up with errors and
then it still works it's like this
program did not register we click okay
and then it just shows up we're like
yeah it's like log in buy the
pay-per-view i'm like i bought the paper
but i did
um so today like on this last one i
bought it really early i was like i
don't want to fuck with this 30 minutes
so i'm going to buy it like at the
beginning of the day so whatever
process has to happen should be done
mine wouldn't stream for the first hour
so i missed the first like two
this is after i've been watching the
prelims too so i'm like give me a
fucking break i've been watching it now
i gotta take a break
uh anyways but yeah michael chandler
really good um
and uh the other the main of the main
event was really interesting too
connor just was just not prepared for
those uh low calf kicks and uh
set as much in the press fight
conference it's so funny because point
like
um he was a victim of the ascendancy of
conor
where like that was unstoppable cotter
that was mystical connor he ran through
everyone that was good
without a fucking scratch and you could
say like oh man those are two different
categories of fighter
but the combat sport evolves people
change people's strategies develop
and then and it doesn't just fucking
shut them down you could still see like
when conor was really reaching
and he would connect you were like oh
any one of those shots could put you
down
like a couple times really oh yeah but
but he fucking didn't
and now like the mystique that conor
used to have
man a lot of that's gone like
when he was undefeated or whatever not
he was never checking undefeated but
like
when he had beaten everyone and then
taken both title belts
he was like like who's gonna who's conor
gonna fuck up next
you know yeah and now conor scene is a
kind of a middle of the road
upper echelon fighter where it's like a
conor mcgregor yeah he's a stoppable guy
plenty of people have stopped him it's
like what
that's crazy i know i'm always hard so i
i i was really hesitant to bet against
conor
because he always just seems to pull out
pull the rabbit out of his hat and win
uh i actually put down money on poirier
this time because the odds were so good
and i was glad about that but to me it
kind of felt like
um bisping and uh chael were arguing
about this to me it just seemed like he
was a little out of the loop like maybe
just due to inactivity
because i felt like you could you could
see him every time he got kicked he said
that too
he was kind of like oh like this is
weird like my leg's not conditioned for
that and he tried to check a couple of
the kicks but you can tell like the
checks weren't very good
because he was still able to get around
and hit the meat of the leg and every
time he was hitting on the leg
he was just kind of like uh and i feel
like if you were
training out like a big team like att
for example that's just something that
would come up
periodically in your training and i
think he's probably just
kind of doing his own thing and maybe
not doing a lot of
like team training stuff like that and
that's fine but i feel like you're just
kind of out of the loop like like you
said
there was a time where he was crushing
everybody everybody else got better he
stayed the same and
isn't up to date on the things that are
going on that's how i saw that at least
100 he actually said as much after the
fight i'm sure you remember the
interview where he was like yeah you
know
to be a fighter you gotta fight and i
gotta fight more so i'll be fighting
again later this year because he had
like been absent for a while and
like sort of showed i'm always skeptical
i'm not skeptical of like
i'm not cynical i'm i'm just interested
in is like is that the case or
has the sport left you behind or are you
regressing you know what i mean like
sometimes people like we've seen
fighters come out at their actual
technical best
and get beat because everyone else is so
much better like what did
um that brazilian dude do wrong against
um fuck's the guy from new zealand's
name israel out of sonia
like nothing he's he's just just a
dominant fighter
like it is not like when i was around he
was off like maybe he wasn't off maybe i
decided really is that good
uh it's gonna be a super interesting
fight him versus uh like
uh whatever what the fuck is his polish
guy's name oh jan blhovich yambohovich
because like
yan this is that's a bigger people and
arasana
can use his unreal athleticism to win
for sure
but also well hobohovich has that
one-shot
killer power not like that one shot like
the brazilian guy needs a couple shots
to put you down and one really good shot
to put you down
the polish dude can just glance you
and fuck you up i mean his fight for the
championship i was like dude he's losing
and then he touched the guy once
the guy collapsed and it was like oh
fuck
that's hard that's hard to to adjust
your to abilities to
and he's a legit light heavyweight
whereas arasana is not even a legit
middleweight he usually doesn't even
have to cut for middleweight you know
what i mean so he's going to be
way undersized in that fight yeah um
i think if conor gets the rubber match
immediately he's going to
he'll win he'll win the third one
because he'll adjust his training style
quickly enough and get on the right the
right path i think
he'd win the rubber match if they did it
like within you know six months or so
interesting i wonder if they do yeah um
all right
next question some online project
oh i think i saw that just above that
actually yeah there we go
dr mike has mentioned having training
partners for quite a while how does one
have training that is individualized in
what is effective movement-wise
while also training with someone do you
switch off uh for exercise then come
back together what about training with a
female who's a different height or and
strength
further context um i train their gen pop
gym and equipment is not as readily
available as i was like this ends up
being a tall order procure two squat
racks
my wife and i train or for working
together loading and unloading the
weights results and more junk volume it
simply
sucks i wonder if you guys have any
solutions to this with all your
different gyms you've gone to and types
of different people you've trained with
so the way like jared and i do it or
charlie and i do it is
we when we design a mesocycle we convene
and choose exercises we have a
negotiation he's like okay you really
like this one back machine
i hate it but we both think this other
back machine is just fine
let's do that i'm like okay sweet
because i'm not going to be training
with him forever
and we just pick something that uh plan
we both like sometimes we can't
concede because there's just like way
too much of a difference
uh and then we just go our separate ways
so a lot of times jared and i will do
the first two exercises together
and it will just go our separate ways
for a third and like if the machines are
close together
we'll still like joke with each other
between them and i'll watch this
technique you'll watch mine
but if they're at the other gym we just
pretend we don't have a training partner
for those you know
um at the end of the day that really is
a process that kind of has to happen
with any training partner you have
you're going to want to do as much shit
together as makes sense and no more than
that
um and as far as i think it's a little
bit of a different question what to do
with you and your wife
so when my wife and i are training
together um i just stare at her ass
mostly make loud comments
um but like you know we're really just
training in the same place my wife just
walked out of the uh she's home early
for some reason
um she's got like red marks on her hands
i think she's been
she's been hitting people on the street
using the house for
recover from police extraction um
typical tuesday but uh you know usually
when we're training together quote
unquote we're just training at the same
gym
we arrive together and a lot of times
we'll be like all right honey i'll see
you in about an hour or just come float
by the squat rack when you're done and
she just floats by when she's done
the thing is like she fucking super
knows what she's doing doesn't need my
ass for shit
to tell her how to lift weights she's
great on her own like she lifted weights
before she ever met me
you know when i croak in about five
years from drug abuse no doubt she'll
continue lifting then
and uh so that's the thing if you have
someone you're really like taking under
your wing
that becomes a little bit tough and it's
gonna have to be some trade-offs
you might have to squat another rack
height i think
james you might have some other examples
i think um
taking plates off and putting them back
on is not a big deal
what is a bigger deal is like rack
height like if james and i squat
together
either he has to bend down a foot and a
half or i have to like shoulder press
the shit out
it just doesn't work so in that case we
really do
show up to the gym as if when james and
i have trained together shitload
traveling
we should kind of show up to the gym as
just friends like i do with my wife
james goes to do this workout i do mine
and when we can do some movements
together we do but when we can't like
we'll even wait for two squat racks
at the same time like i'm not like oh
james will let me work in like no
working in is a bad idea for both of us
so james isn't there by himself it's not
like i showed up with him i'm gonna
fucking stick with him
and vice versa so uh it sometimes you
just have to set up your own shit it
might mean that you take a little bit
more time
but taking more time is usually better
than
having dog shit training i think uh
james oh yeah no i totally agree with
you
and actually a really good example the
last time one of the last times we
trained together
and this came up on one of the webinars
but we were in thailand and mike was
like let's do this leg workout together
and i was like okay cool
normally i i'm guilty of like being very
independent so normally like mike said
when we go to the gym together we just
go as friends and i
i am the anti-social one where i'm like
i have my own things to do i'm gonna go
do it
metal in headphones right that's just me
right like mike's more of those social
like let's train together i'm more of
the like i'm doing my own thing but
we're on vacation together so i was like
yeah okay let's do it
and uh one of the things mike wanted to
do is hamstring curls and i train at
home i don't have a hamstring curl
machine i haven't done hamstring curl in
like two years right
mike's like i'm gonna do four or five
sets of this and i was like like i'm
gonna do like
one set see how it goes two tops and
then i'm just gonna wait for you to
finish and then we'll go and do
something else together and so in that
case it was like i know that my
basically mrv at that point is two sets
of this just because it's a movement
that is really good for me and i haven't
done it in a long time so i don't want
to push it too hard
mike's been using those in the mix for a
while he's gonna have to do a bunch to
get the right stimulus
so i'll wait for him and then we'll go
do something else together and i'll just
you know
check my emails or something in the
meantime but yeah it's i think those
things are all
really good i think um taking the
weights on and off is
i really i wouldn't call that junk
volume per se unless like it prevents
you from doing your shoulder or bicep
workouts in that case you could make a
case for it honestly i
even if you said that i'd be like bro
come on like most people are conditioned
enough
to to take weights on and off pretty
yeah i will say training with a female
oftentimes what you can do is you can
have her do two sets for every one of
your sets
you have to take weight off less and
also she's going to be recovered so fast
that for her it's not a problem to do a
set
rest a minute do a set that's three
total minutes you can take three minutes
between sets and just have fucking
really great sets
um and it also share movies probably
higher than yours she has to do six sets
of squats you have to do four well
that's perfect because if she does
doubles
uh then you basically finish at the same
time so there's a few workarounds but
don't feel the idea that you need to be
married or joined at the hip in the gym
like it's cool to let the person float
off and
if you're coaching them too you got to
wonder what the trade-offs are but maybe
you could just coach them for a few
weeks and then
later do your workout or do your workout
another time then eventually when they
know enough you can come to the gym
together
yeah one thing that i've done with
success in the past with mel is um
she'll just put whatever weight she's
using on and that'll be the inside
weights and then i'll just try and put
whatever i can on the outside so i can
just take mine on and off
and not have to do a whole switcheroo
every time so if i can get away with
like
okay i just got to put a 45 and a 25 on
top of whatever she's using perfect
i'm good like boom yeah fuck sliding all
the shit off and then putting on new
weight that's bullshit
yeah all right
furious dan a bit of a ways down
as a fucking anime female character i
got
so furious so furious
dan says assuming calories and macros
are constant i.e ignoring
satiety and palatability hypothesis
uh what elevates clean whole food diet
over an absurd example of cheeseburgers
ice cream multivitamins with respect
high perch for your fat loss
well one thing is that there are a bunch
of preservatives
uh and stuff like that in super
processed food that's probably not great
for your health in the long term
there's also probably phytochemicals and
various other nutrients
including fiber in plant-based foods and
in
lean meats etc that are actually very
good for your health especially the long
term
other than that like if you manage to
ignoring the satiety and palatability is
tough
but let's say we take you for for you
know to say okay fine
within respect to aperture fat loss long
term it's a bad idea for health but
as far as like in 12 weeks can you rig a
diet
of cheeseburgers ice cream protein
shakes and multivitamins
and get pretty much the same fat loss
results yeah
yeah you can because calories and macros
are king and then everything else is a
tiny percentage
our analysis of the of the literature in
most of our rp work for
body composition which is summarizing
the renaissance diet 2.0 book
shows that food quality food composition
which is exactly what you're asking
about
maybe accounts for as much as five
percent of the variance
between diet results with equated macros
and calories
and timing and supplements and because
you mentioned multivitamins you've taken
care of
pretty much all those and we're assuming
the timing is the same
it's a tiny almost undetectable
difference in the short term in the long
term it's a stupid fucking idea
um but yeah really in in it's it's funny
because
we did of course the proper literature
reviews to show that that was supported
in the evidence but
one of the things that all of us who
wrote the renaissance diet
have come to writing it we came with a
huge experience of
seeing high-level athletes being around
them and coaching them
you got to realize like football players
that play for the nfl
eat pure junk as 90 of their diet
and they're some of the best shape in
the world it cannot be
that the composition of your food has
this huge effect
on your performance fat loss and muscle
because there are too many counter
examples
um usain bolt his pre
one of his gold medal meals was chicken
nuggets from mcdonald's which i'm sure
the ceo of mcdonald's when he found out
was like yes
karen pack the boat we're going on
vacation but like
uh you know it really is true that
you know food composition is really a
long-term
thing and in the short term you can get
crazy shit done by eating pure junk in
the right amounts
i wish it weren't so we've had pushback
james i don't know
if you remember people like food
composition is only five percent like
yes for performance and fat loss and
they're like what about health because
this is not a book about health but i
do understand what you're saying in our
book about health it's like 20
it's a big deal uh but that's over the
long term uh
and that's just what it is yeah really
great response um i know
my wife dr mel was doing her game
changers critique and she's been doing
quite a bit of
an extensive literature review on
plant-based and otherwise
and you know she would tell me
ultimately it's
one of those kind of broad strokes but
like a diet that is rich in
plants generally is better than one in
terms of health outcomes that is not
in a diet that is really really high in
processed foods
is generally worse than a diet that is
not
so it's one of those things where it's
probably a good idea for your health to
not have a you know a super saturated
amount of
junk food in there and it's probably a
pretty good idea to eat things that are
plant-based to some degree
like fruits and vegetables and grains
and stuff like that
exactly all right
tomare
[Music]
is it possible because of a hard
workouts the sleep quality of that day
will be poor
it's my second week of my mezzo so
probably not over trained try to keep to
ir but i woke up
um like two times in the middle of the
night and fell asleep felt awful so
first of all
just on a scientific reasoning basis you
don't want a reason from
one a sample size of one it could be a
trillion things including just
randomness
but if you worked super hard and
really disrupted your nervous system
uh with an unreal effort in a really
really hard workout
especially if that work goes very close
to bedtime you can
absolutely disrupt your sleep i just
don't know if you can clear that off of
this one
james yeah like mike said there's too
many potential variables
usually the most obvious one with sleep
and exercise is if you were exercising
too close to bedtime and having a hard
time falling asleep
really doesn't tend to manifest as
obviously unless you're overreaching
in terms of like having sleep
disturbances in the middle of the night
it's one of those more like
i just can't fall asleep because i'm
still amped up from working out that's
usually what you run into so
i would say check your sleep hygiene
kind of the normal boxes like
when did you have when did you cut off
your caffeine like did you have a wind
down routine you're trying to go to
sleep at the same time
the same wake-up times stuff like that
is probably going to be more telling
than
how hard you worked out um it could be
related not to say that it couldn't have
been that
but i would say there's a million things
and that one's probably not a huge
probability
yeah sorry i said probably and then
probability in the same sentence so
i would say a low low probability
candidate on a very large list of things
yeah all right next up
is well my screen's doing crazy shit
chris arnold
with that with a k oh chris
got it yeah it's a chris angel with the
two essence that's so fun
sexy of all the men i wouldn't let have
sex with me he's not on that list
[Laughter]
his his stunts are cool i think they're
fun yeah that's nice
yeah um chris arnold says
sadly i need to have some shoulder
surgery partial
thickness tear of the subscapularis with
bicep tendon subluxation into the tear
ooh no shit about that that sounds like
pieces of stuff or not
places where they're supposed to be what
are some questions you would ask
to screen a prospective physical
therapist to ensure that they are a good
fit for someone who wants to return to
an athletic lifestyle uh
james is a real expert here so let me
just say one quick thing um
[Music]
you could just straight up ask them like
do you have experience returning
athletes to play and how big of a
priority is that
because a lot of physical therapists
will be like um yeah like
i do i've worked with athletes before
you don't want that answer
you do not want that answer and they'll
say yeah like you know return to
performance is good
but like maybe you you know we'll see
or whatever if you really want a serious
sports physical therapist the way they
answer that question is like yeah
i work with tons of athletes and as a
therapist my priority number one
is to get you back into play and they
may even say as soon as possible or
they'll say
i don't rush because i want to do a good
job but we want you back to full
capacity because i understand this is a
big part of your life
if they even articulate that you're
probably pretty good hands
um if they don't and they're like um
yeah sports
that's cool uh have some experience they
usually won't
they're not stupid enough to deny
themselves business by being like i
really just don't care if you do sports
again um just my job is to
get you to be able to use your arm if
they say that then for sure they're not
your fucking
uh candidate but a lot of times you can
just straight up ask them and they
if the answer is very convincing you're
good to go if it's not i would probably
choose another person james yeah i have
mixed feelings about this one i've been
kind of going back and forth on my mind
so like on the one hand
the physical therapist job is to get you
back to normal function right
so if they're good at that you will
seamlessly transition over to your
athletic stuff once your normal function
has returned and that really is you
that's on youtube
that's on you right exactly um on the
other hand
it is true that there are some who are
more focused on like getting you back to
like long-term adls versus like
long-term
you know maybe more moderate term back
to athletic lifestyle
so this is something though that is
usually pretty obvious if you call
or go on their websites you can usually
get a pretty good idea of the clientele
that they typically work with
my my my inclination is a little bit
more towards the the former than the
latter though i mean like what you want
is somebody to fix the problem
right and then getting back to athletic
lifestyle is kind of on you to
do their recommendations and not be a
knucklehead when you're trying to
transition once you get clearance to do
incrementally harder more athletic
things to not be a knucklehead right
and to follow their instructions so i
actually think like
the reputation as a physical therapist
should probably be
the the biggest factor like if they
generally have really good reviews on
google and all those other things and
if you get a referral from someone you
know it said hey i had you know knee
surgery and this person was really good
i think that you should go with them
i think that holds a lot more weight
because i think
return to athletic lifestyle the error
is not
because of physical therapists it's
because of people being stupid
right your boy included that's why i'm
saying that i was that guy when i did my
knee surgery i was the guy who was like
i want to get back to rugby as soon as
possible
guess who didn't get back to rugby as
soon as possible because they were
stupid
me not because of the physical therapist
right so that's why i'm more inclined to
think like
find a good physical therapist and then
go from there at that point
yeah yeah because you're you're more
likely to make an error than they are
you know right like
for sure all right
gustavo leia gomez oh it's got two
he has a question that doesn't get a
shitload of upvotes but i think it's an
important thing to answer
so we're not going to be uh super uh
perseverative on it but
he says there's something i really want
to know in regards to the male physique
template which is what we have an rp is
something you could buy and it's a
training template for a hybrid program
why proximity to failure increases is
volume increases at the same time
wouldn't it be unsustainable for most
people to do lots of
assets to failure in the fourth week
so uh yes
and actually king in the north did
exactly the right thing
uh and uh uh adriana's pont excellent
responses from these guys
they said the last week doesn't need to
be sustainable because this last week
and i have one more modifier to that uh
volume doesn't increase at the same time
failure proximity necessarily has to
increase
it it's coded right into the towns
volume is completely auto regulated you
can do the same volume the entire time
you could
lower your volume as you progress that
is entirely up
to the regulatory approach that you
apply
so if you feel recovered and you feel
like you can train more
and you rate that accordingly it'll
program you with more volume
if you feel like you have more than
enough volume you're rated accordingly
it won't give you any more volume
so the volume is all based on what your
body's responses are so if your body
responses are yes more volume is good
then yes volume increases as well as
failure proximity which
if you're running a temple correctly
just gives you better workouts
but if there's such a thing as too much
falling you can easily avoid it by not
rating
volume to increase when you know it
shouldn't be increased that's it
yeah i agree really good answer
uh all right and then uh second to last
andrew atkinson got it which is a very
british
name atchison
in it you fucking cunt oh hey
they all complain that i do the wrong
accent and they're all the same fucking
people to me so
fuck them just kidding i love you both
all right
andrew says hi doc's have a question
related to hip hinge movements
whatever doing this such as stiff-legged
deads or good mornings i feel tension
burn and stretch in the hamstring which
is good
but also equally or more so in my lower
back
and lower back tends to be limiting
factor around my hands do you think this
could be a technique issue i'm not very
flexible but do standardized reps
or is this normal as they are compound
movements for the posterior chain
soreness wise my lower back seems to
feel it more the next day than
hamstrings as opposed to hamstrings
uh on isolation like curls
they get more sore not sure if this was
missed last week with a lot of the
upvotes hopefully
a lot this week um either way uh thanks
as always for the great content so
i think it's a relatively easy answer
it's totally fine and totally normal for
your back to be a limiting factor
you should contin continue to train
those movements because they hit your
hamstrings pretty well hit your back
excellently and eventually
your back will hypertrophy get stronger
if you only hit your hams that much
harder and you'll have a fucking ball or
a
set of erectors to show for it um so
that's totally cool but you should make
sure that in the interim
you are still training your hamstrings
between mvp and mrv and not letting the
back limit them
which means maybe uh as you do go heavy
on the good mornings
and stiff legs after normally like if
you could get a maximum stimulus you
would just do your hip hinges and then
just move on to quads or something like
that
maybe in your case since it's just not
hitting your hands enough
you can pepper in one to three sets of a
different kind of leg curl than you do
in the other
part of the week so that both you can
hit your hamstrings and your lower back
gets exposed i didn't want to give you
the advice of pre-exhausting so that
your hands are tired before
because i do want you to push your lower
back strength and size
with these exercises which they're
excellent for you just got to fill in
the blanks and making sure you do a
little bit more hamstring work isolated
after
so that you're not completely missing
out on a good hamstring workout for that
session
yeah really good answer i think um two
so two things i think um it's okay for
that to be sore
it's it's part of the movement right as
mike already said one thing i do find is
that sometimes
when you are still feeling like when you
you get a lot of like noticeable so
i don't say a lot but when you have like
really noticeable soreness in the lower
back
more often than not i do think it's a
technique thing because typically you're
hinging kind of just past the point that
you can maintain the posture and then
actually getting a lot of trunk flexion
as you are rising up into the movement
so what you might consider doing is
modifying your technique a little bit
by just cutting that range of motion
slightly shorter than you normally do
and really trying to focus tension on
the hamstrings for that time being
because i'm guessing what you're doing
is your posture is really
there we go like really good for the
most part and then at some point you
round over and you're doing a big like
trunk extension
as you're coming up on the concentric
part of the movement if that's not the
case
um what you could also consider doing is
just do as many sets until like all this
if you get like a really big lower back
pump let's say like you do two sets of
good mornings and all of a sudden your
lower back's like real
fucking pumped that might be a good time
as mike said to either switch to a ham
curl
or i would say you could even switch to
like a 45 degree back raise since you'll
be really warmed up for that exact
movement pattern
so you can just do as much until you
start to feel like your lower back
taking over and getting big pumps
and then switch to something else like a
45 or a glute ham raise 90 degree back
raise any of those options would be good
as well in addition to like the leg curl
stuff
there you go last stop
man that's even tough for me to say in
russian
god damn he says
coleslaw tell you what
any thoughts on collagen supplements do
they notably improve regeneration
rates for joints or are they mostly
placebo-ish assuming they do work and
someone wouldn't
want to consume them all the time which
training phase in particular would be
best to take them
then he says uh
[Music]
oh here we go he actually transliterated
his name for me in russian
fucking polls kranowski's fucking easy
shit they got eight extra letters in
that motherfucker that don't fucking
pronounce god damn it
what the fuck's that r for god damn it
the z get that z out of here
yeah there's no kranowski that's not
that bad anyway
i'm all i dance you're the man uh ex
excuse our anti-polish sentiment so
um by the way if you ever go i don't
know you you may very well be from
america who knows but if you're ever in
a western country
they're gonna look at your last name and
first name be like
control just like yeah like look guy
you got to fake your name better um
and then he says james's log splitter is
my new hero i shall not develop a
martial arts school of hugging one's
enemies
to their respective deaths from not only
pressure but also unbearable amounts of
love
and forgiveness named the hog splitter
trademark
pending brilliant that's an excellent
martial arts style
yeah the all you have to do is produce
like 60 tons of force and
you'll be really good at it just crush
people um
the literature i've seen on collagen
supplementation
shows that not only does it not do
anything
your body digests the collagen into its
essential
components which are amino acids are
small strings of amino acids it absorbs
it like everything else and the fate of
that protein is almost identical to any
other protein
it is a fine quality not incredible
animal protein
so you're better off just consuming whey
protein because it's probably cheaper
and almost certainly more anabolic
collagen does make up your connective
tissues in large part
however when you consume it everything
about
collagen goes away because it just gets
broken up into individual amino acids
and it doesn't just float through your
interstitial lining and end up in your
blood it has collagen which are also
probably
really bad because your blood would form
a fucking toxic
inflammatory response wouldn't kill you
um
same thing as if you asked like you know
i got like i got growth hormone i drank
all the vials what's gonna happen like
you just pissed away
seven hundred dollars of of growth
hormones effects
from uh essentially just like you got
like
two you got like hey you got like six
grams of protein out of it
uh it's all it's the most expensive
protein you'll ever have um
but yeah i you know if collagen works
way and i don't think it does
injecting it would be what you want to
do and you would need bacteriostatic
water you need ejectable collagen
infractions
they don't even make that they do make
collagen injections for
um your lips plastic surgery uh
but like i don't even i don't even think
intrajoint collagen injections do
anything so
it's one of those like i would i don't
want i guess in some cases it really is
a scam
but it's a real typical fitness
marketing where it's like james remember
the horse mitochondria joke
yeah back in grad school horse tank 5
000 horse tech 5 000 you could have
horse mic
because some guy asked he's like can we
like if we in
like get horse mitochondria would that
make us better at sports like
if you had a manner by which you would
unzip individual muscle cells
insert horse mitochondria into them
prevent the immune system from attacking
said horse mitochondria
and even if all the cytochromes aligned
in the at the environment inside the
human cell was enough like in the
environment of horcell
to actually produce energy and if that
mitochondria was the limiting factor
then yes you would be able to run like a
horse but pretty much none of those
things are true
so you know it's like it's like taking
like a fucking
alien like great a better analogy it's
like taking
like an intel pentium 5 chip and be like
all right can we put this inside a model
t
to make the model t go better you're
like where it doesn't have any
connections to the
chip it doesn't have a computer so like
it's not that's not how you do that so
unfortunately
collagen is like people think about it
and they're like collagen
bone strength connective tissue strength
good if i take it in
some essence of it will end up in my
bones and in my connective tissues it'll
be better for me
unfortunately all that essence as far as
i know is digested
uh into just amino acids so it's real
probably
more expensive way to get protein one of
my favorite old-school uh
scams was the atp supplements that you
see at bodybuilding.com like do you need
energy atp take this pill um
yeah so i like the collagen one too
because in my mind i imagine you're
taking a collagen supplement and there's
like strings of collagen
that are now floating in your
bloodstream and it's like oh acl
pop there it is like just tape it on
there you go acl that's how it works
that's how i like to think of it in my
mind yeah
i'm with dr mike on this one anything
that goes in your mouth
is subject to digestion and at that
point it's just a crap shoot because it
just breaks everything down at that
point
it's kind of like uh you know it's kind
of like when you put something into a
food processor right it's like okay well
i have this like broccoli or this like
celery like you put it in there
it just takes what was a piece of
broccoli or a piece of celery and breaks
it into fine little bits that
it's no longer really broccoli anymore
now it's just little chunks of stuff
yeah and some of its essence gets
conserved maybe some of the flavor
that the texture's gone so like you're
like can you taste the broccoli they're
like i guess
this is what the sisters look like green
paste you know um
specifically it's like if you were
eating broccoli for the fullness effect
of those
huge volumes if you blended it all the
fullness effect is gone
uh so just the same way collagen's
effect
is pronounced when collagen is created
by and integrated into connective
tissues
and it it's not even clear that
enough amino acids are a limiting factor
for that like
well actually and tell you it's not that
it's not clear it's just not the case
like if you quadruple the amount of
protein you have hypothetically allowing
you know your osteo uh class to
uh or sorry your osteoblast to like you
know
build a shitload of bone they don't
build any more bone than normal like
you know if you take a shitload of
growth hormone they might start doing
that but that's not actually raw
material it's a signaling pathway
so just because you have more collagen
even if you could somehow get collagen
into the blood which again would have
its own problems
it's not clear that anything would get
built out of it it's almost like
delivering bricks to a housing building
site where there's no workers like you
can deliver all the fucking bricks you
want no one's putting them in anywhere
so like it's fucking kind of pointless
that's really i think a pretty decent
analogy
yeah totally um was that the last one
that's it
all right well i want to give a shout
out somebody on one of these webinars
recommended the anime jiu jitsu kaizen i
don't remember who it was but whoever
you are out there
great pick awesome show definitely check
it out if you guys are interested
um dr mike let's see what do i got going
on i've been uh working on
a lot of the amazon stuff and so one of
the things that i've started doing is
we're trying to do some of the paperback
print on demand so a bunch of our titles
like the volume landmarks first book
recovering from training nick's book and
a couple other ones now are available on
print on demand so if you guys want
yourself a paperback
there you go you can get it on amazon
boom
dr mike you've got any fun things going
on
all the mass gaining videos are
releasing once a week that we filmed in
orlando

and charlie do
stay tuned for those tons of stuff
coming out on youtube
um that's all i got for now
all right if you guys uh i don't well
you might be able to catch the last
couple days
of this depending on when this gets
posted but right now
nick's book fit for success is on sale
for like
a dollar and understanding healthy
eating is on sale for like
two dollars on the kindle stores so
by the time you're hearing this it might
be towards the end of that promotion i
think but if you want to check those two
out
now's a great time because they're
