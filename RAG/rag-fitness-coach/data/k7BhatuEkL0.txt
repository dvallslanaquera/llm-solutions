stress adapt recover on repeat for well
over a year that's a discipline M the
ice bath the ice is interesting because
if you have to be dynamic for a roll
tomorrow and you can't be stiff and sore
but you're going to be a little stiff
and sore because you had to train today
the ice bath will do two things it'll
really greatly reduce how stiff and sore
you are the next day keeping you Dynamic
but also greatly reduces the effect on
improving your physique and your
strength and your abilities of that last
session that you did so icing is kind of
better for peing especially when things
aren't on track like they're supposed to
be and you really have to cool off
inflammation maybe there was a context
for this but I suspect there probably
wasn't a lot of people think icing is
just like a net benefit it's just like
this goes into this whole lore of
 training where you do like
really exotic tough like ice bats
of course ice bats are good for training
didn't Rocky do it or some like
that ah
