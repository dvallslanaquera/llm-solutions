ethan sipley of hollywood theme he's
been
in boy meets world i think
ball rats yeah holy shit i got one
and of course remember the titans which
i mostly forgot
folks ethan is used to hollywood
workouts will i be able to take my shirt

but now he's in the streets to be more
specific in the streets of las vegas
we're in the streets baby the streets
shit is dangerous out here isn't that
right jared
our neighbors wave at us when they drive
by that shit is fire
garage workout and guess what we're
training
arms let's get into it
[Music]
i've never done an arm i mean i've done
an arm workout yeah we do like you know
some arm stuff at the end of some of the
training blocks but we've
never done it right arm workout no
consistent
i don't know if it feels okay yeah if it
feels like a lot of editing here
quote i don't know how to do this i
thought he worked out you worked out
before
60 65.
65 is like your biological age
what
[Laughter]
ethan spent a lot of his childhood in
the hollywood trailer
jared you grew up in a actual trailer
similar type of trailer do you feel like
that kind of makes you an actor
uh yeah uh first exercise is gonna be
barbell curls ethan just finished his
first massing messy cycle
after we did that entire cut process
that you all saw
uh in men's health and all the other
cool stuff
but uh barbara curls we're in last
mesocycle we're basically just going to
try to increase the load a little bit
from where we were
at the end of that one and then we're
keeping in some more variations that we
had through the process but since this
is like a garage style workout
quarantine style workout
smith's skulls will be replaced with uh
lying skulls of the barbell but
everything's gonna be very similar to
what it was
in the previous block of training
i wasn't on the way up there you go
glue control hand on the way down
breathe out the way up
breathe in maybe a little too late
breathe out stop good
like that shit breathe out good stuff
let me show you so the whole time ethan
on the way up for some
heat contraction there you go now down
from there much better
oh yeah come on big ass chest and up and

[Applause]
come on go go go go good stuff
excellent
yeah definitely definitely
next exercise for ethan is going to be
the incline dumbbell curl
really focused technique is at a premium
set of 10 to 20 reps
technique is huge here if you just hold
the weights around it turns it like any
other bicep movement
if you really stretch it out really go
deep really feel the mind muscle
connection a lot of good stuff happens
and a
videographer guy can we get rid of the
sun fuck
if you can control it and keep your
elbows out here
up twist down slow
every time yes correct supinate really
hard at the top
fuck that's the guy from boy meets world
i'm pretty sure ethan's about to get hit
by a car super hard
squeeze good down slow good

pain slow

beautiful that's it
hey do you have a pump do you feel
pumped oh yeah cool very good
yeah no no that's not it
i don't see your trailer around here
your lazy hollywood motherfucker
this is your first time really training
this structure for a long period of time
so you're gonna be able to put tissue on
for sure
good keep that cadence throughout
momentum at the bottom pure muscle
good look how big is the fucking laser
yeah a big boy
when you're eating spleen everything is
a chest exercise
sorry let's go
a little more stretch a little more
straight all the way down now up squeeze
down
beautiful don't rest at the top so much
let's go you're squeezing at the top not
right squeeze
and then down squeeze
and then down yes
good momentum that was not a squeeze
that was straight bullshit
squeeze squeezing good right here shoot
that one too hard squeeze squeeze
squeeze then down
up squeeze control control slow

slow
slow slow come on up squeeze one
slow slow slow squeeze
two super slow up two seconds
squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze down and
then five eccentric
two three four
five beautiful
that's it for that oh man
that's fun
[Laughter]
all right so skull crusher time we've
finished biceps time for triceps
skull crusher great tricep movement you
need bare essentials of equipment
barbell's good enough
big question about skull crushers is
where to touch some people go
behind their head some people go to the
forehead nose
eyes some people make out with a bar
like myself
some people touch the chin there's a
spectrum
of a skull crusher going all the way
essentially from an overhead extension
all the way to what we call a jm press
which is really just like a press to the
upper chest
which the elbows are tucked in and
there's more tricep activity
where you choose between those two
extremes is entirely up to your own
stimulus to fatigue ratio
what stretches and puts tension through
your triceps more
what hurts your joints less than what
allows you to develop the highest levels
of tension
if you check those three boxes and of
course pump burn so on and so forth
then there could be a lot of right
answers between there there could be
zero and you hate skull crushers and
don't do them
but for most people there'll be one much
more correct answer
of somewhere where they feel like it
feels the best for ethan he likes to do
it to his nose
or to his chin that might not be the
case for you you can sure as hell try it
back here or even to the forehead
it's all about individualization let's
get started and see ethan suffer
forcing that was another way up and down
oh yeah beautiful
that was the whole time the whole time
on the way down too
let's go in in
beautiful
there you go easiest pal
i was in come on vitamin spiderman
oh yeah good far past beautiful spidey
man up and back
fight him invite him in last one more in
in good stuff man
really good there you go
so folks with skull crushers a good tip
here is
not to let the weight become preeminent
over technique it's very easy to get
attached to the numbers and skull
crushers
and start doing more and more and more
and the entire time you let your elbows
drift out you're starting to press the
weight
maybe on the way down you're doing okay
but on the way up you start pressing it
the key is to always check yourself
before you wreck yourself
but on a serious note you really want to
make sure to keep your elbows in on the
way down
and like jared keeps cueing on the way
up as well
are you feeling it in your triceps then
if that's the case
you proceed to progress in loads and
reps so long as your technique is always
good
keep the metals in okay let's go there
you go last one good
elbows let's go ethan
good stuff good
good shit sounds good
very good
for the last exercise with ethan we're
going to be doing a mile rep style
deficit close grip push-up to finish off
the triceps uh we've intro my reps on
this channel millions of times but
basically
we'll be taking him very close to
failure multiple times in one set
he's going to do a few push-ups rest a
good ten seconds five to ten seconds
do a couple more we're going to take him
to failure more often this time in one
set
probably somewhere in the to 20-30 rep
range
maybe go go about that a couple times
all right ethan high quality
every single rep is good butt up in the
air a little bit here you go chest
hit the ground first perfect
full lockout control slower on the way
down yes there you go
those are good
oh yeah
up up up good rest
freeze chair to let you know when it's
time to go again
let's do regular first ready
three or four five here yep
ah beautiful control up
good control come on up
up full extension good knees go
go let's go let's get to 20.
good one chest first control oh yeah
push
good one more you got it
let's go ethan big chest push up up up
up up
up lock it out lock it out lock it out
yep
fuck you guys now we're in the streets
we're not in hollywood anymore baby all
right folks
street style arm workout crushed crushed
pumped you want to do this yourself use
whatever equipment you have
as best as possible always always always
technique first then relative effort in
each set make each set hard
and then toggle how many sets you need
to get it right for you to get you that
excellent hypertrophic stimulus
jared any final thoughts yeah that's
good i would say uh
most people have at-home weights that
are a little bit lighter than what they
can go in the gym
so like you said with controlling and
honestly using tempo
with these types of sessions is a good
idea he was doing some slow easy tricks
on the
incline dumbbell curl things like that
it just kind of helps you to get a
better stimulus that way
that's it folks remember wherever you go
in the world even if it's hollywood keep
the streets in your soul
see you next time
you
