when it comes to training and diet most
of us realize that for the most part
shortcuts either don't exist
or aren't worth taking over the long
term however when it comes to the squat
there are four science-based things you
can start doing right away
that'll have a near immediate impact on
your strength regardless of experience
level now i'm going to skip most of the
basic stuff you've probably already
heard before
like you should squat more frequently
squatting two to three times per week
usually is the sweet spot
you should squat earlier in the workout
when you're fresher and make sure you're
eating enough calories and protein
these are all very important tips but i
want to focus on strategies you may not
have considered before
okay so my first strategy is to prime
your nervous system for a big squat by
using acclimating drills
like walkouts and pin squats now when i
say prime your nervous system there's
nothing spooky going on
you're simply preparing your brain and
nervous system to get used to firing
under heavy loads
this sort of works like when you shoot a
weighted training ball and then the
normal basketball feels much lighter
afterward
so for heavy walkouts load up 95 to 105
percent of your one rep max
walk the weight out brace as you
normally would and then walk it back in
without actually squatting it now if
you're new to walkouts start with weight
you've actually done
first and then work your way up to supra
maximal loads
slightly above your current squat max
and it's smart to set the safeties
higher than usual
just in case and still use a spotter if
you have one and if you hit these once
or twice a month
before your planned squat work for the
day not only will it make those later
sets feel even lighter
it'll get you more confident and
familiarize your upper back and
stabilizers
with what it feels like to support some
heavy weight another variation that's
helpful is the pin squat where you set
the bar on the safety pins at the bottom
and start with a concentric phase this
can be extremely helpful for lifters
myself
included who get intimidated by the fact
that the traditional squat
starts with the lowering phase you can
contrast this with a deadlift where if
you don't lift the weight it just stays
on the ground
no big deal but it's very common for
even experienced lifters to worry that
they'll be able to unrack and lower the
weight just fine
but then get buckled under a failed
positive so by setting the bar up on the
pins
you start the movement with the positive
and finish with the negative
which can eliminate that fear of
lowering the bar and not being able to
get back up
and a cool progression with these is to
set the pins at about half squat depth
and then gradually lower the pin height
over time until you get to parallel
or just below so if you're new to pin
squats i'd recommend starting with
something around 65 to 75 percent of
your one rep max for four to six reps if
doing them to parallel but if you set
the pins higher you can load much closer
to your max and then progressively
lower the pins from there so if your
lack of confidence in your squat is
holding you back
it will help to pick one of these drills
and do it once every couple weeks or so
okay the second strategy is to fine tune
your ideal squat technique
many of us get locked into one way of
squatting simply because it's how we
first learn to squat but you'll be able
to put up bigger numbers
much faster with a simple fine tuning of
three aspects of your form
the bar position your squat depth and
your stance width
we'll start with bar position according
to a pole of my own audience only about
a quarter of you squat low bar
that's despite the fact that most people
are five to ten percent stronger
with the low bar position in fact a 2017
study comparing the two variations
found that the low bar back squat is a
more efficient way of squatting large
loads
however there was an influence of
expertise meaning there may be an
adjustment period for the low bar squat
where you need to get used to the
technique first
before you see the strength boost now in
case you're not sure about the
differences between high bar and low bar
i'll put a table up here that you can
pause and read but the main difference
is that you simply shift the bar down a
couple inches further on your back
that's about it this shift will cause
you to lean slightly more forward as you
squat
but the bar should still travel in a
perfectly straight line
over the middle of your foot also i
thought about this and that pull could
be a bit
skewed because in my squat technique
tuesday video i demo the high bar squat
and i do tend to slightly favor it for
hypertrophy
because it allows you to achieve a
similar muscular stimulus
with lighter loads however if your goal
is to get your squat numbers up
it's a no brainer to at least give
lowbar a try most people
are stronger with it now this also
doesn't mean that you should permanently
switch to low bar exclusively
like me you can use a combination of
high bar and low bar variations
concurrently
squatting low bar for heavy top set work
and high bar for some of the paused
technique and hypertrophy work these
variations should help make you a more
well-rounded lifter anyway
next you want to optimize your squat
depth and when it comes to squat depth
there are two schools of thought that
can both work so it's important to try
out both
and pick the one that works better for
you the first school of thought is to
intentionally cut your depth to just
what's needed for your goal
the thought here is that since less
depth means less range of motion
all else equal you should be able to
move more weight if you limit depth
within reason
so if you're squatting for power lifting
you do need to get the hip crease below
the knee joint
but there's no point in wasting energy
going any deeper than this if your goal
is general strength and size
you only need to go to parallel or just
below parallel and again
going deeper is just wasted energy
however the second school of thought is
that you should squat as
deep as you comfortably can to maximize
the bounce that you get out of the hole
formerly known as the stretch shortening
cycle now as a lifter i personally fall
more in this ladder camp i find that
whenever i squat with the intention of
limiting depth
i actually end up being weaker but as a
coach i do recognize that this is highly
individual
so you should absolutely experiment and
find the ideal depth for you
people with good ankle mobility will
usually squat more by going deeper
and getting the bounce and people with
less ankle mobility will usually squat
more by cutting depth to the minimum
required amount the last aspect of
technique will fine tune is stance width
now if you currently squat with a
shoulder width or just outside shoulder
width stance
next time you squat go about two inches
wider on each side
and flare your toes out slightly more
according to a mammoth of an article by
greg knuckles a wider stance lets you
hit the stretch reflex we just talked
about without going
unnecessarily deep increases adductor
involvement
and makes the lift easier on your back
collectively these things
should allow most people to squat more
weight with a slightly wider stance
however everyone's anthropometry is
different so it might not work for you
still as a lifetime and narrow stance
squatter myself this is something i'm
going to experiment with
over the coming months okay my third
strategy is to learn to use your
training gear better
or consider investing in some if you
don't have any of course you don't need
any gym gear to put up impressive squat
numbers but there are three items with
pretty solid empirical support that i'd
recommend
first a belt now if you already have a
belt it's important to remember that a
belt
isn't a passive tool you're not using it
to get lazy in your bracing
you're wearing it to enable your body to
work harder and smarter
so you'll get a lot more out of your
belt if you actively brace against it by
breathing
down into the belt before you descend as
you push your midsection
out in a 360 degree manner rather than
only inflating your gut from the front
this will create a more solid
rigid column of support reducing energy
leaks during the squat
and don't worry research repeatedly
shows that belts don't actually reduce
core activation
contrary to popular belief if i had to
guess i'd say most people will see about
a 5
boost from wearing a belt especially
once you learn how to use it optimally
so if you currently squat 405 pounds a
good belt
should take you to 425 pretty quickly
knee sleeves are a bit more optional but
seem to work by bunching up behind the
knees
allowing for a bit of extra spring out
of the bottom they also add a feeling of
comfort and stability
which can reduce the perception of
difficulty at the same loads
allowing you to tolerate more volume in
my coaching experience they seem to give
about a two to five percent absolute
strength boost
a figure supported by a brand new study
covered in a recent issue of the mass
research review
lastly using a shoe with a solid sole
will increase stability and force
transfer
much better than a running shoe with a
squishy sole if you're on a limited
budget i'd recommend at least using a
pair of chuck tailors or vans
and if you have limited ankle mobility
and struggle reaching depth
it might be worth investing in a healed
squat shoe although this is more a
matter of personal preference
i'll also leave some recommendations for
all three down below including affiliate
links to some ryze gym gear
if you want to take your squat game up a
notch or two and support my work here on
the channel
in the process alright my fourth and
final strategy is that you need to set
reasonably regular weight prs or rep prs
in your training and how often you
should be setting new personal records
depends entirely on how advanced you are
as a lifter
so we'll break this up into three levels
as a novice or d trained lifter in your
first six months of training
or retraining you should be setting new
prs pretty much every session
in this case you should pick a single
rep target like five reps and simply aim
to add
five pounds to your squat every week if
you were to actually stick to this
every week it'd translate to over a
hundred pounds on your squat in less
than six months
this is called linear single progression
where you're keeping the sets and reps
the same
and just hitting these minimum five
pound prs every week in a linear fashion
once you get to a point where the sets
feel really grindy or you're not able to
maintain good form
while adding weight it's most likely
time to move on to a more advanced
progression
so once you hit the beginner to
intermediate stage you can start using
linear double progression and this can
work also if you're more advanced but
have been
less structured with your programming so
here you'll pick a narrow rep range
say four to five reps and alternate
between adding one rep
and adding some weight from week to week
so for example
in week one you do three sets of four
reps with 200 pounds
in week two you add one rep still with
200 pounds
in week three you add some weight but go
back to four reps
and then in week four you add a rep
again so now you're doing five reps with
205 pounds
so you're still progressing linearly but
weight prs are being set
only every other week now and then once
you reach the intermediate to advanced
stage prs will be less frequent again
and progress will be much less linear
but you still need to set
some kind of pr with some regularity for
continued progress
this can be something as simple as
hitting weight and reps that you've done
before
but with less exertion or with better
technique for example in my intermediate
to advanced power building program
you work up to a near pr weight or an
actual pr weight for a top set every
second week
now exactly how heavy you go is auto
regulated but these sets are meant to
serve as
signposts that you're moving in the
right direction along the way
then at the end of the 10-week program
you perform a max test with the goal of
setting a new pr
so depending on just how advanced you
are this could mean that you're setting
new prs for a given rep count
every other week or simply approaching
prs every other week and then hitting a
new max at the end of the 10 week block
either way the point is that as you get
more advanced you still need to have
these regular
but necessarily less frequent signposts
in your training
confirming that you are in fact still
trending in the right direction okay so
guys if you're looking to put all this
information together into an actionable
routine i recommend checking out my 10
week power building program
on my website if you're an experienced
trainee looking to take your size and
strength gains up a notch
or you can check out my fundamentals
program if you're still in your first
year or two of lifting
my power building program has been
easily my most successful program to
date
and i've never seen so many people add
such impressive numbers to their lifts
in just 10 weeks
and i'll link more info about each of
those programs in the description box
