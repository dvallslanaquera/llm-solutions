don't be a idiot don't take the shit if
it's illegal never ever cheat at sports
always work if you end up being in a
place where it's legal and you're not
cheating in sports work with a very good
coach
[Music]
hey folks dr mike here from sound
superiorization and
ifbb pro jared feather i'm going to say
that every time every time
we are here to answer a very important
question
critical importance societal importance
existential impulse move aside global
warming
are
all pros taking boatloads of gear
this is a claim
you will hear quite often in the forums
and other places
that
if you want to turn pro if you want to
be pro if you want to be a top pro
anything to do with pro bodybuilding
but there is a sub segment
of a sub segment is redundant good god
segment
of folks who will say
to be pro bodybuilder you have to be on
the kitchen sink yeah my favorite is if
i took as much as him i'd look the same
related idea
so
now here's the thing reality is
complicated and nuanced and
almost everyone who speaks about
something has some kind of validity to
their point even if we have to really
reach into the bag of tricks to find out
where that validity is
so let's chat about it and have a
relatively open conversation without
naming names of course
uh
does it really take the kitchen sink to
be pro
to compete pro
to turn pro
to win pro
and how much are the pros really taking
of course you're all literate
scientifically minded people so you know
that there's going to be
you know normally distributed uh sort of
topography of how much you know some
pros take very little most of them take
an average amount some take an extreme
dose could be a power law distribution
it goes like this i don't know jared uh
you know you've worked with tons of
people you've been in the industry for a
while you've had you know once you turn
pro real talk really get into this weird
like fraternity of like other pros just
recognize that you're around like you
they like don't see you until you get an
ipv pro car they're oh and they start
talking to you so you've been privy to a
ton of conversations yeah of course um
top trainers are pros
yeah
yeah yeah youtube sure sure well you
know i'm kind of seen as like less than
are we talking about middle school or
trauma no
reliving pass through my past lives
um all right so first question for you
jared and i'll try to add in some
tidbits of my old bullshit that i don't
know about
are directly are all pros
on a ton and we'll just define a ton
combined orals plus injectables of three
plus grams per week on average for the
year so before that question i'm going
to go ahead and say when we sorry real
quick
uh testosterone replacement therapy is
usually between 100 and 200 milligrams
per week so we're talking about multiple
is less 30 yeah sometimes sometimes less
a multiple of 30 of normal male
testosterone or similar uh anabolic
hormone levels is that really the case
yeah so before we talk about that we'll
talk about um in the other video we
discussed how important genetics are
and but before you understand
if these top guys are taking a lot or
not you have to understand that
genetics also includes uh your affinity
for muscle growth to begin with
your uh affinity to the drugs how well
the drugs uh help you build muscle how
well you can handle them psychologically
is one of the biggest uh
that i've come across now since being in
around a lot of pros
i know so many guys and we've literally
met a couple last year that have dropped
out of shows because of the
psychological burden of what they were
taking what their coach had them take
so that is literally part of the
genetics portion of
of bodybuilding it's how well you handle
this farm just to be clear the
psychological component is
generally speaking anabolic drugs or
anabolic steroids specifically
cause some psychological side effects
it's not a perceptive thing it's not
like all the psychology of dealing with
the fact that you're ruining your health
it's not that it's that the drugs often
increase
aggression and specifically increase
anxiety
in an interesting way the anxiety is
expressed as it's just anywhere you are
at any point in time you just don't want
to be there you just want to be
somewhere else just want life to kind of
just get on with it and it's just a
discomfort at all and it seems that a
lot of the more neurotoxic ones have
that aggressive surprise issue yeah like
triad and stuff like tren yeah
um so you have to understand that first
but
the answer to the question is no because
it's not you can't just say everybody is
on a lot of stuff
um generally when you look at somebody
and you see
like really great shape um super great
muscle bellies they're really jacked
they can handle farm a little better you
see guys that are pros that don't
actually like exactly have that shape
generally they're on a bit more so like
the guys who are just like
uh bowling balls who
don't don't necessarily have super
amazing muscle bellies um
i have you know quite a few of them run
a bit more because you want to be a pro
you want to be a damn pro like there's a
lot of a lot of guys out of new york
that i know that have taken quite a bit
so what you're saying is if you don't
have the muscle valid genetics to
step up with that a lot of the guys that
don't have great shape genetics will be
like well i have to compete somehow so
it's going to be through just raw size
and leanness so they have a propensity
to believe that to so then they take
more drugs sure because they'll hear
what their counterparts are taking and
then they'll be like oh so i have to
take more than that because this guy's
just going to beat me because i don't
have the gifts right so that's why it's
like that it's not just random and
psychological but
um so the answer is no you know a lot of
guys
that are at the top talked quite a few
and um
they'll be on less than some of the
national competitor guys um those guys
have been chasing the pro card for 10 15
years and
never got it and they just think more is
better and i have to do more more more
and uh in my experience those guys take
more than everyone yeah for sure for
sure um when you are going to be a top
guy you you kind of know when you start
sure you know whenever you cross over
and you have been training for about a
year on stuff it's like that guy's gonna
be something he's gonna be somewhere and
those are the same guys that generally
respond really well um as far as growing
muscle goes
to the pharmacology so
actually the top top guys are not
necessarily always taking the most
interesting yeah are there guys in the
open ifue ranks
that are taking less than a gram total
per week on average um
i i could probably say this because
he talks about it openly
that on youtube yeah then that's cool
and on instagram and everything so uh
there are guys who promote a lot of
safer use models i'm gonna go and say
that uh joe jeffrey from physique
collective john jewett who i'm going to
talk about and a few other guys they
promote these safer use models you can't
say safe use models because it's never
going to be this it's not inherently
safe
safe for use models it's like driving a
car right exactly
you're never going to be fully safe
so they promote basically these
milligram per kilogram dosages that are
a lot less than what you would
traditionally see in a lot of the open
guys john dude is a 212 pro so he's not
necessarily open but
he's an ipv probably but he's taking
fourth at the olympia i believe
and i think sixth sixth he didn't get
fourth uh two three years ago i think it
was six maybe it was six john i don't
know maybe we're both wrong
or something else
he's a very high level 212 pro
he
um
into his show i believe talked about a
podcast on youtube with joe a physique
collective george jeffrey um being under
a gram like 700 milligrams into the his
last couple of competitions whoa and
that he's currently doing the same thing
he's not even above gram right now
so i saw that on instagram yeah
so
there are guys and and you know that
also has to do with timing if you're
massing sometimes they're on lower
dosages if you're really close to a show
that's usually when like most of the
stuff's in there you include the orals
you include somebody some people do ais
you include all this other shit um
so that's usually when you see them on
the most and even then john was saying
you know he was under a gram so it's
like it's very impressive for being one
of the best in the world and in person
he looks absolutely absurd insane yeah
humongous hamstrings are fucking three
hamstrings yeah
it's wild
well a lot of the open guys i'm not go
i would feel pretty confident saying
none of the open guys are under a gram
or at least very few right they're all
over fucking 240 on stage you know it's
just they're huge they're huge people
and a certain milligram holds on to a
certain pers like kilogram of muscle
tissue it's just how it works so unless
you were like a
a 6'4 offensive linemen and you already
had quite a bit of fucking muscle to
begin with and you decided to get lean
like i believe docile carver was that
way yeah he was like a lineman before
yeah and yeah and uh so what college was
he at i forgot i can't remember but
somewhere in tennessee but yeah that's
what it looks like when i fucking a
college football athlete uh dies down to
be a bodybuilder they're just humongous
all around so
but
short of that
it takes some grams yeah it'll it'll
take you know a bit cool
next related topic
classic guys
men's physique guys
some different models there with use
yeah yeah quite a bit i mean so we're
talking men's physique
five years ago i could rant on men's
physique for a while we're talking men's
physique five years ago when they uh
were actually mixed physique and they
weren't bigger than the classic guys
like they are now
um
they i know guys that turn pro naturally
actually i coached the guy the term pro
naturally
and then didn't have to take stuff till
later on because the qual you know
prerequisites for for how good a men's
physique guy is was you know beachbody
ready steve cook type of people right
guys not that big yeah it's not that big
um you know mark anthony the first ever
ipp pro was substantially smaller than
the guys now who are turning uh or first
sorry first ever mr olympia and miss
physique was substantially smaller than
the guys now like they're bigger than
classic physique guys because they don't
have a weight capture i've seen some of
these guys backstage and i'm like i know
i always think they're classic guys i'm
like well i'm fucked yeah i'm going to
combat guy's immense physique yeah it's
wild man um
and you know a lot of those guys it's
the same way with all of them um
some of them are on quite little some of
them are quite a bit
it's just how it is
and then
okay so last question here
do
pros typically just stay on all the time
and blast and cruise
what fraction of them come off
completely for how long and is that
similar for men's physique and classics
so thankfully um there's a you know a
lot of intelligent people out there who
are talking about these safer use models
and they're just people who are
pretty well uh educated on the topic of
pharmacology so it's it's awesome that
those guys are out there
there's always been this sort of you
know blast and cruise mentality in there
um there's been like pct which is like
hcg and some other shit that people get
on just so they can be on more drugs and
not come off drugs they're basically
putting in different types of drugs so
they feel like they're doing something
great for their health and it's not
necessarily better health phase right
health face um
so a lot of these guys are on for the
duration of a show prep and i have seen
a lot of these guys do show prep
multiple shows in a row at this point
even the open guys like last year were a
few guys who made fucking huge runs and
you don't come off during that time um
you can come off of specific compounds
that might be more deleterious to the
health like trend like it's more
neurotoxic
and then you add them back in when you
get closer to the next show come off a
little bit but you're still pretty high
in the pharmacology
so
when it comes to that
a lot of those open guys they're
probably staying on longer they're doing
more
than the men's physique guys the classic
guys on average it's just how it is
again a certain milligram of farm holds
on to a certain kilogram of muscle
tissue it's just the way it works
so if you
are men's physique and you're always on
shit probably cut that out if you're
classic physique you're always on shit
cut that out a lot of the open guys
they're just on forever so they're doing
blast in the cruise with btrt uh which
is generally from joe this is not our
condition for me uh go watch joe
physique collectively he would say you
know three to five milligrams per
kilogram is a good uh
running
dose for those guys for their cruise
phases yeah so
um but yeah most of the guys are on all
the time they commit
it takes a lot anything about uh insulin
growth hormone etc uh any any sort of
insight you have from what the pros are
actually using i'll just say you're
seeing it a lot more in the open guys um
we're getting our advice currently from
joe he doesn't like about six but we've
heard people go
astronomical so what's the reference to
growth hormone dosages uh human natural
production is somewhere between oh
around two ius per day
um and then so the real business dose
for getting shit done is anything above
that
six ius per day
transforms the fuck out of you
um
i will say i have heard of numerous pros
in the eighteen plus
range quite a bit and i mean uh and this
is again this is on youtube so uh
jp
uh has admitted jordan p is it peterson
or peter's peter jordan
yeah
jp has been on uh 100 units of insulin
by the way uh
if you if you shoot 10 units of insulin
you can eat 300 grams of carbs in one
meal and then two hours later you're as
hungry as if you've never eaten
a lot yeah
so hundreds a lot and then like over 20
ius of growth 20 hours of growth hormone
so that'll do something yeah i mean he
attributes that to blowing out his waist
so yeah which may be
not wrong right
right
okay a lot of these guys have taken
quite a bit uh again
even him he's uh coming over to the
safety use models which is cool yeah
that's great so he gets promoted
as well now which is good
very cool so sort of a recap
some classic physique guys some men's
physique guys are on quite little yeah
so and maybe are on
off most of the year or some of the year
and then just kind of pre-contest for
the last 16 weeks or whatever just
really get into it
and then open guys open ifp pros
probably on most of the year
many of them never come off and just go
to trt
and
then when they do go
a lot of the guys are in the one to
three gram per week range yeah and
many though not the majority are
probably in the three plus range yeah
what is the highest realistic dose that
you've seen from people that aren't just
like
not something you see in a reddit sub
thread what do you mean realistic like
you have good evidence to think that
they actually took that much
we both know that story well why don't
you tell the story and keep the person
out of it yeah for sure we
know
a man who was sending emails to his good
friend and that friend showed us the
emails and
uh
was it
15
15 15 or 20 per week it's 23. 23 grams
total
was what the
basically he was inquiring to his friend
he was like hey is this a lot this is
what my coach wants me to do what do you
think
and the friend saw and was like what the
fuck and it was 23 grams total i don't
know where you put that so a syringe is
is like three milliliters okay
um most of the dosages of farm i've only
seen 500 milligrams uh a test is one but
that's the only thing i've ever seen
that's test 500 is the only 500
milligram that i'm aware of and that's
fif that's a gram and a half 1.5 one
needle and you need 23.
you know it's like that's like where do
you put all that 15 needles a week where
do you put it all i have no of that just
that it baffles the mind yeah so that is
highly unusual very new uh but there's
probably more than a handful of people
taking that are only eight plus three
five five to twenty yeah
yeah there's quite a bit
interesting interesting well
if you guys like this kind of crap
let us know in the comments yeah if you
have any questions that maybe you are
curious to have jared back on to talk
about more insightful stuff about pros
and what they're really doing
you know like um we don't super enjoy
talking about this kind of stuff because
most of you are natural
we really just you know prefer to deal
with that and
most of you are here for nutrition and
training and not drug stuff
but jared and i do have a
a knack for having an annoyance at
secrecy yeah and at uh opacity like
there's this mystique of what are the
guys really using
and
i i know a lot of pros have flat out
lied about they were using in order to
try to not
influence young people to do as much
right um
i believe dorian yates said he'd never
taken over a gram right before which
maybe nobody believes uh maybe it's true
it's just a five percent maybe one
percent maybe half a percent chance
that's true
um but i get where he's coming from
because if you tell people like look
yeah i took three and a half grams you
know some 16 year old kid somewhere in
england or some shit is going to be like
let's do it yeah um
so just to recap this is for
informational entertainment purposes
okay
don't be a fucking idiot don't take the
shit if it's illegal never ever cheat at
sports
always work if you end up being in a
place where it's legal and you're not
cheating in sports work with a very good
coach some of the kind of doctors
some of the guys i listed like always go
for the guys who are preaching these
safer use models
chavez rodriguez is a good one joe
jeffrey
john jewett in his own right um
many others
just kind of know stuff and we'll keep
you safer than not
and uh if you're interested about all
this other stuff we have a bunch of
other videos
about
pharmacology and bodybuilding about how
much muscle you can expect to gain about
how it interacts with diet and training
give those a look
don't dump shit see you next time
you
