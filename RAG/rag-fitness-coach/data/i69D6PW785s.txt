hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
can vegeta kill superman and batman at
the same time
yes the answer is yes if you disagree
with that
it's okay to be wrong we all come around
eventually
folks here's the deal we'd love to talk
dragon ball z for
a long time but instead we're going to
talk about the stimulus to fatigue ratio
i have a lot of videos and a lot of
writing all over the internet about this
this is a more quick video kind of like
a user's guide
simple straightforward stuff to figure
out what the stimulus to fatigue ratio
is
and how you can best use it to enhance
your gains in hypertrophy in the gym
let's get right into it so
today we're going to talk about
basically having
specific goals in growth training to
make sure that they're
lined up accurately we're going to talk
about how to estimate the stimulus of
muscle growth when you're training
because directly measuring it requires
muscle biopsy and all this other crazy
stuff you're never going to do
we're going to talk about estimating
fatigue how much does training beat you
up
we're going to talk about the stimulus
to fatigue ratio itself and how it folds
out of that
and we're going to talk about exercise
selection and technique and how they can
change the stimulus to fatigue ratio
and lastly about how you can personalize
your own training to get the most
out of it so in
growth training in training for
hypertrophy for muscle size
our goal with pretty much every exercise
is to stimulate the target muscles to
grow
that's it we just want to turn on the
cellular growth pathways and the target
muscles and that's
exactly why we train when we're training
growth it's not a mystery right
now that means that when you do an
exercise
especially as you get to be an
intermediate and advanced level lifter
you're not so much doing the exercise to
just move the weight
or just get it done you're doing the
exercise
to actually target a specific muscle or
muscles usually
one muscle is really the main focus per
exercise to get it to grow
and that probably means that muscle
should somehow
feel being targeted okay
so you want as much stimulus as possible
going to the target muscle
but also you want as little fatigue as
possible
what is fatigue fundamentally it's kind
of two things in hypertrophy training
you get a high degree of fatigue if your
joints and connective tissues are
bothered a lot
by a certain method of training or a
certain exercise right you're doing
squats your quads feel great feel like
they're getting a great stimulus
but your knees hurt and they hurt more
and they hurt more and they hurt more
not the greatest thing in the world
certainly not very sustainable for a
long time even if you get some
short-term growth
fatigue can also be systemic systemic
fatigue comes from a lot of
places and has a lot of sources but what
it does is it impedes your ability to
train hard later
not just for the local muscle but for
the rest of your body as well
and a lot of times systemic fatigue
stems from exercises that take a lot of
effort to do
for what you get out of it especially
psychological effort we'll get to that
in a bit so
what you want to do is maximize stimulus
and minimize
fatigue in essentially every exercise
and every method of training that you do
because that will bring you the best
results just maxing stimulus is great
but then it doesn't concern itself with
a fatigue and it becomes unsustainable
just minimizing fatigue is great if you
want to never accumulate any fatigue but
you may never grow
right so we need both high stimulus and
as low fatigue as possible
how do we estimate these things in the
real world because the end of the day
yeah theoretically good clap slow clap
professor mike
that's nice but how do we actually in
the gym figure these things out it turns
out we have some good hints
so estimating the stimulus there are
roughly three
proxy measurements we can use to guess
pretty decently that an execution of a
certain exercise in a certain
way a certain amount of or type of
training has a pretty decent
hypertrophy stimulus to the target
muscle
the there's three boxes basically and
the more you boxes you check off
and the more bold the checks are the
more clearly
happening these things are the more
likely it is that you're causing not
just
muscle growth at all but higher degrees
of muscle growth per any unit of doing
that kind of training so number one and
these are not an order of importance we
need all three
ideally all of them but a few is a good
start
number one mind muscle connection we
don't just mean like oh yeah i have a
bicep i can feel it moving
that's not a mind muscle connection in
the role of hypertrophy training
in hypertrophy training the mind muscle
connection is either you perceive
a ton of tension throughput through the
target muscle
or you have a high degree of lactate
burn in the target muscle the first one
happens usually with the heavier loading
range just sets a 5
to 15 and then the burn happens usually
in the 15 to 30
rep range but sometimes in that 10 to 20
range you can get a good degree of both
here's the deal if you perceive for
example your training biceps
and you perceive a high degree of
tension through your biceps as you're
curling
that's a good sign that means you're
using your bicep if your bicep is
generating tension
that is a huge part of what causes
hypertrophy and
if your bicep for high reps is
generating a ton of lactic acid
that means that it's being used and
that's also a good thing it's like a
lactic acid accumulation sort of a
measurement
of how much tension you've accumulated
over time which is a really high rep
effort
both are very good where does this leave
us well
if you're getting a lot of tension and
you're getting a lot of burn that's
probably a good sign
but the opposite is also true if you
don't really feel
much tension or much burn in the target
muscle it might be a poor stimulus
for example let's say you're doing curls
in a new way one of your buddy showed
you
and you're feeling tons of tension in
your forearms and even like in your
front delts
and not a ton on your bicep and when you
get close to failure for high reps your
forearms are
on fire your front delts are on fire but
your biceps aren't burning
that's probably not a good sign so if
your friend is like hey what do you
think great bicep exercise you could be
like yeah you know
definitely great forearm exercise maybe
even front delt exercise
i can't be confident that it's a great
bicep exercise no matter
how it looks biomechanically because at
a technical level
if you don't feel a ton of tension
through something maybe you're onto
something maybe not sometimes you can't
perceive tension super well but still
being generated
but if you don't get a super high burn
in something for higher reps and
something else that's a burn
that something else is probably closer
to its own muscular failure like your
forearms are closer to their muscular
failure than biceps
so when you stop the set you could have
stopped at forearm failure like your
forearms just can't work anymore to grip
and to
do their own flexion but your biceps the
local actual bicep muscle
might be three or five reps away from
failure it was just beginning its hard
work that would be stimulative and thus
it doesn't get
a good show so we want as much of a burn
and as much tension perception
as possible that's number one number two
the pump
it's very good if an exercise for a
muscle group
gives you a good robust pump with just a
few sets that's usually a good sign
and this is nothing like rocket science
you guys know this you do some kind of
new chest dumbbell press exercise and
two sets and you're like holy crap my
chest is blowing up
that's really just not a bad thing
remember the pump itself at a
mechanistic level probably causes
hypertrophy
and it's a symptom of the fact that
you've been really generating a ton of
tension
for lots of reps and generating
metabolites all those cause hypertrophy
and they also cause the pump
having a pump is great that's a good
thing to check off and the opposite is
true as well if you don't
have a big pump after doing lots of sets
of an exercise or a different technique
it just might not be the greatest
exercise in the world like if someone's
like bro i got this chest doctor site
it's going to annihilate you
five sets later they're like you pumped
up you're like not really
right or if there's a pump in your
biceps and front delts but not in your
pecs
maybe the chest isn't the biggest target
of that exercise right
last one is muscle disruption so
an exercise that is robustly stimulative
should leave the target muscle
feeling some combination of the
following weaker
right much weaker usually after numerous
working sets
not working properly right lunges hit
your glutes like crazy and if you
haven't done lunges for a while
you try your second or third set of
lunges your glutes start to misfire
and stretch a cramp like holy crap
something's going on or if you have a
huge pump in your chest after cable fly
drop set you you flex your packs like i
can't even
feel my pecs anymore like something
they're hugely pumped but also just like
this is i'm totally out of touch like do
i even have pecs anymore like
something probably happened to them and
that something is probably a lot of
tension through foot metabolites and
pump
all of which are really really good and
there can be some soreness it can be
soreness just
a couple of hours after they feel sort
of tight and stiff it can be delayed
onset soreness that can take a couple of
days to heal
anything in between isn't so much good
or bad it's a sign that you probably did
something productive with the muscle now
the soreness part especially
there can be too much of a good thing
too much stimulus
creates way too much damage and makes
you sore for a real long time so
soreness isn't like as much of it as we
can get
but i'll put it to you this way and this
is the the red text here
the the sort of corollary of this the
opposite is
if your muscles don't feel affected by
the training for example you did like 10
sets of chest and you got no
soreness at all man maybe that exercise
or your nutritional status or your grips
or whatever
your technique is just not the most
hypertrophic thing in the world but if
you do like
three sets of stiff-legged deadlifts and
you get sore for a week and a half
that's probably too much but look 99
problems but a stimulus is not one of
them
clearly you're doing some stuff to your
hamstrings it's just easier
to go and say okay great i figured out a
great exercise let me do half of the
working sets
and be super out of my way rather than
doing like six sets of something and
being like
i guess nothing happens so another way
to measure this is like
uh it's super easy for something like
legs if you do a really crazy quad
workout a really hard quad workout
something you think is stimulative
and you could just hop skip out of the
gym afterwards did you really train legs
though
maybe is it stimulative sure you did
some work i'm sure it's somewhat
stimulative
but a really really good leg workout one
that is maximally stimulative or just
very stimulative you're gonna feel
interesting walking around
walking downstairs it's gonna feel funny
you might be crampy you might feel weak
those are generally things that are good
that there can be too much of a good
thing but if you don't have them at all
and you're not making progress in the
gym you sort of know why
and that's too little stimulus so these
are three
stimulus check marks right mind muscle
connection tension feeling in the muscle
burn feeling in the muscle get a pump
from not a ton of work or some reason
while of work
and your muscle gets messed up both in
its physical abilities
in its perceptive abilities and probably
or rather it's perception of like
something's wrong
it can be crampy and then it potentially
can develop some kind of soreness those
are all if they're happening if all
three are happening
again 99 problems but stimulus is not
one of them you're probably you could be
maybe
you're not training frequently enough
maybe you're not eating well
but the session itself is hard and it's
probably hard enough to grow
if you're getting two out of the three
yeah you're probably doing just fine
you'll probably grow but maybe not
optimally if you're getting one out of
the three
eyes a betting man wouldn't bet that
you're growing muscle but you could be
you could prove me wrong
if you're getting zero out of the three
gee you're like you're gonna grow muscle
by shear accident at that point if at
all and i wouldn't bet on it so we want
as much of these things
generally speaking the more the better
unless we're talking about soreness and
then some is definitely better
than none because you at least know
what's going on you're doing something
to the muscle
but stimulus is not enough let's talk
about fatigue so
what's the deal with fatigue we have
three just to keep it simple three proxy
stimuli
or sorry three proxies measurements in
the gym in the real world of fatigue
first one is joint and connective tissue
fatigue
so after training during training and
after training
your joints involved in the muscle
training should feel pretty good
okay so how do you score poorly on joint
connective tissue fatigue
you do like a set of smith machine
incline bench and every time your elbows
are like ow
ow ow ow three sets later you're like uh
uh your training partner's like set for
you like nope i'm done for the week i
can't even
properly please myself anymore if you
catch my drift because the elbow has to
bend usually
unless anyway here's the deal folks if
your joints are killing you
during an exercise that's usually not a
good thing
right maybe you can make some
adjustments maybe some other things can
change but generally speaking that means
it's a high degree of fatigue and it
doesn't just have to be during it can be
after
you could feel hunky-dory doing hack
squats because you're warmed up and
you're psyched up and
when you're warmed up and psyched up
actually your perception of pain
decreases that's on purpose it's part of
the fight-or-flight response
so but like a day later or 12 hours
later
your knees could be real bad like oh my
god holy shit the
hack squats really messed me up that's
not necessarily a great thing if you can
find a way to hack squat or find another
exercise that doesn't do that to your
knees
that's better right so if an exercise
wrecks your joints to connective tissues
it probably is creating high fatigue
which is not a good thing right
next one is rating of perceived exertion
this one's a little tough it's a little
nuanced
for the stimulus that you're getting the
easier the exercise is the better
and i have an interesting illustration
from uh geared powerlifting which almost
nobody does anymore but bear with me
in geared powerlifting you put on a
bench press shirt for example
and you touch to a couple of boards or
something like that it takes an
unbelievable amount of effort to unrack
like 700 pounds
and touch to like a two board okay it
takes
everything in you to psych up because
unless you're like remembering
terrible trauma from your childhood the
bar doesn't even come off the rack that
you gotta try like
like that grit you do a set of three
and racket okay question how hard did
you have to try
holy crap you had to wake up demons okay
how much of a hypertrophy stimulus did
you get i mean did you get a pump
no did you perceive tension on the
target muscle maybe but like really
you're just thinking about survival
right do you do you get any kind of
soreness in the muscle like a deep
soreness a day later no you just usually
get joint soreness because such a small
range of motion was such a heavy amount
of weight
so at the end of the day the rating of
perceived exertion was massive
the return was really small so the rpe
the higher it is the worse
we're not saying you don't try and
training of course you try
but if you find techniques and exercises
on which
for how much you try you get a huge
stimulus that's great
right putting another way if you can
just coast through a session and still
get messed up
holy crap you guys ever traveled
somewhere to another gym or your gym
ordered a new grip attachment or
something like that or you figured out a
new exercise
you get on a hack squat machine and
you're doing like three plates usually
you do four or five
and with three plates you're like oh my
god my quads and this huge
pump going on and tons of metabolism
like this is the easiest pump i've ever
gotten that's what we mean by rpe
stimulus is awesome
just not trying that hard listen you can
always try harder and when you try
harder on these exercises
you get an even better response but
remember there's only so much
psychological effort you physically
have to give over the course of a set a
session
and a whole week even a whole month of
training so if your training is so
awesome
that it requires you a little bit of
psychological uh
sort of amping up a little bit of your
sort of burning or psychological fuel to
get good training
but you can always do more but like
we'll take the easier training if it's
possible we're not saying choose the
easy movements
we're saying choose the easier movements
that still give you a good result so
there's something to be there and if
there's a movement that requires you to
just get
crazy in your own head move heaven and
earth and you honestly can't say it's
growing muscle
why in god's name are you doing it maybe
you should change the movement change
the technique
so on and so forth lastly there is
strength decline in unused muscles
real good measure of systemic fatigue so
the rating of perceived exertion
the higher it is sort of the worse if
you're not getting a good stimulus
that is a proxy for what causes systemic
fatigue
the strength decline in unused muscles
is our third index
of fatigue that's what sort of measures
how much systemic fatigue you have what
does that mean
if you do a crazy crazy workout
of deadlifts and then afterwards you go
and do overhead tricep extensions
how are you going to hit a pr and
triceps no you're going to be half
dead you're going to lift like 60
percent of usual weight reps and sets
and be like oh my god and someone's
going to be
you really hit your triceps right you're
like i don't think so man
my soul is done i can't even push hard
against the bar i just need to get out
of here
on the other hand if you did a whole
bunch of barbell bent rows
maybe a similar stimulus for many parts
of the back that the deadlift has
but afterwards can you do overhead
tricep extensions which involve
basically none of the same muscles
well yeah and you could probably hit a
good pr on it too and feel just fine
so if an exercise or a training method
toasts you like
your whole body it's going to really
interfere with other muscles
growing and that's not a great thing if
an exercise toasts
one specific part that you want it to
toast and leaves everything else the
hell alone for the most part
that's awesome because there's not as
much spillover of fatigue into the
system
and that way you can continue to train
other muscles productively so
an ideal fatigue exercise just on the
fatigue scale not the stimulus scale
is one that beats up your joints and
connective tissues either not at all or
very little
it is not very difficult to pull off and
you don't have to move heaven on earth
with your mind to try to do it and
it leaves you pretty fresh for all the
other muscles you want to train now
clearly it's going to be messing up that
target muscle for sure
but it's going to leave everything else
alone if we combine that
with us an exercise or if we take an
exercise which has all those features
but also one which has a high degree of
stimulus
holy crap are we on to something really
really good
so that's something really really good
is the sfr
the stimulus to fatigue ratio it's
probably the most important variable
in exercise selection for hypertrophy
training and maybe just exercise
selection for everything
here's the thing the higher the stimulus
and the lower the fatigue
the better okay for example if your
stimulus is low
and fatigue is really high that sucks
good example is doing quarter squats for
quads quarter squats you use like 700
pounds
and it crushes your spine rounds your
back it hurts your hips it hurts your
knees
it's super hard to psych up for because
the bar won't move unless you like
really lose your mind
and what do you get out of it someone's
like hey you quarter squatted 700 for
five
you're like yep i'm the man like okay
did you feel the tension in your quads
no no i just felt it in my knees and
sole okay
did you get a burn your quads no how's
your quad pump i don't have one
really okay so far so bad
right and then a day later be like do
your quads really sore not really
back in the day i was like 19 years old
i did like a set of like
nine with 685 or something like that in
the eighth squat
mega fucking stupid okay out of pin like
rack
out of pins and everything i was so
proud of myself because i was fucking 19
years old and i wasn't very smart 19
year old so
i was like man i didn't know anything
about training i was like man that's
going to be a great stimulus and i still
remember that to this day
i was expecting my quads to really get
sore because they had before from other
training that was
more full range of motion better
exercise selection and the next day
it was the only time my life was
actually happened to me my knee joints
were physically sore
and nothing else my quads were all
untouched
my knees were sore i was like hmm you
know hamster running in the wheel in
that brain like
maybe i'm an idiot right not a good
thing
not a good thing okay so quarter squats
a terrible
example and a lot of partial range of
motion exercises same idea
not great stimulus super high fatigue
bad bad deal right
what if fatigue is pretty high but the
stimulus is also very high that's
actually pretty decent
and sometimes if the stimulus the raw
stimulus we call it just the stimulus
itself if that's really high
you can justify that to break plateaus
and put on slabs of muscle especially if
you can take a lot of fatigue you're a
beginner you have a lot of time your
recovery is really good
so something like uh deep high bar
squats nobody's gonna tell you squats
don't mess you up
right they could be okay for your joints
but they really take a lot of effort and
they cause a lot of systemic fatigue
um but the stimulus is crazy right so
there's still you know the
in the quarter squats the fatigues like
this the stimulus is like this total
shit
in the full depth squat the fatigue is
probably less but the stimulus is up
here so that's really really good
then we can have another situation where
both sort of come down
which is also okay it's just usually not
as time efficient so that's
not a very high stimulus but fatigue is
also very low for me for a long time and
it's sort of changing because i'm
changing my technique a little bit
but and this is just an example for me
this is not dogma at all
you have other exercises i'm sure that
affects you with this for me it's been
cable rose for a long time
i get in a cable roll i do stuff i do
the cable roll you guys have seen my
videos i do
really good technique i think on
everything full range of motion and all
that shit
and i still feel a thing and i could do
like six sets of cable rows back in the
day and i'm just like
and someone's like you're back pumped
i'm like no like it's a heart exercise
i'm like no
i can do this in my sleep and it just
doesn't do anything right this is the
worst thing in the world because the
worst thing in the world is really high
fatigue like quarter squats and shitty
stimulus
this is like the stimulus is shitty but
the fatigue is also really low so it's
like you know just not super time
efficient it's definitely better
to have a high fatigue and high stimulus
because there's something justifying it
right then a low of both but the high
fatigue and low stimulus that's the
worst one of all what's the best one of
all duh
low fatigue super high stimulus so
that's awesome
for me for example full range of motion
pull-ups
even assisted pull-ups for sets of like
10 to 15 reps on a good assist to pull
up machine where you can pull really
high
and then control eccentric on the way
down oh my god
it tears my lats into bits
and i feel so golden afterwards i am
tired at all i could do another whole
back workout after that
huge pump huge soreness huge everything
it doesn't beat up my joints
i don't even have to try that hard it's
awesome if you have exercises that are
more like that that leave you feeling
very stimulated but very low fatigue
those are the ones to choose more often
than not
which brings us to this next slide on
exercise selection and technique
when choosing exercises to do choose the
higher sfr ones how do you know which
ones are higher sfr
folks have asked me is there a list of
high sfr exercise no because this
entirely individual
it's what you get a pump from what you
get muscle disruption from
what you perceive tension from and what
affects your joints
in the best possible or least bad
possible way not me there's tons of
differences so there's no gold standard
you just have to try it i know that
sucks but you're in the gym anyway doing
stuff
and you like to do different exercises
so every two months or every few weeks
when you change exercises
note how stimulative the exercise is
note how fatiguing it is and sort of
keep a
backlog in your mind sometimes you can
write the stuff down too but honestly
you're going to know
especially if you like training and you
do it pretty often you're going to know
what messes you up really well
without taxing your joints and being the
hardest thing in the world to do
and you're going to know what it does
the opposite of that which is a shitty
exercise which you probably won't do for
long so definitely make a note of this
for yourself
and the more stimulus you get
and the less fatigue so first of all
highest of our exercise is great because
they just stimulate you more
right but there's another golden nugget
by stimulating a ton and not adding a
lot of fatigue
if you have the time remember
your biggest cap as an advanced lifter
on how much
you can train is going to be your
fatigue hits your mrv maximum recovery
volume
and you can't do any more training you
have to de-load if
your stimulus is really high from an
exercise but your fatigue is really low
yes you can stop and that's great and
you've got a great stimulus great
but if you have the time and the energy
so on and so forth
you can do even more sets of that
exercise that session or spread over
more sessions and so on and so forth
and you can raise the stimulus really
high now the fatigue will start to creep
up
but once the fatigue hits the top hits
your mrv your stimulus is huge
so not only can you get a great workout
you can fit in a doubly grate
more working out into the same fatigue
area under the curve awesome amazing
right it's like um eating a super it's
like eating potato chips
not only do chips taste great but they
don't fill you up at all so you can keep
having great taste and keep eating two
bags of shit
that's really bad for you as far as
weight gain but if you want as much food
pleasure as possible
you're not going to broccoli you know
broccoli first of all each piece doesn't
taste great and second of all three
pieces later you're full
right this is like potato chips the
stimulus to fatigue ratio style are like
incredible taste
per unit but also you can double and
double and double and triple
and slowly you get full slowly the
fatigue builds up
same kind of idea right now when
you're doing an exercise so it's not
just about choosing do exercises you're
like all right
hack squats are great sfr for me leg
press is not so much maybe totally okay
so maybe you have squat a little bit
more than your leg press
but per exercise you can fine tune your
stimulus to fatigue ratio
increase it by fine-tuning your
technique what does that look like it
looks like a bunch of stuff for example
you can alter your grip width bench like
this bench like this bench like that
you can alter grip direction on pull
downs do you grab like this do you grab
underhand
do you grab overhand do you grab one of
those weird like sort of neutral ones or
the ones that rotate right
those different grips and positions can
absolutely change the stimulus to
fatigue ratio
you should be experimenting with with
them to find the ones that get you the
best now remember
there's not usually like one correct
answer you'll have like three or four
variations of an exercise that are
awesome
and then three or four variations
they're like and then three or four
they're like no bueno
just stick to mostly those three or four
that are awesome that's it that's
super super easy another one is stance
position
uh width and foot direction do you put
your feet like this on the leg press do
you put them like that
do you put them like that do you put
them up on the platform down on the
platform so on and so forth
all of that stuff is very personal and
there's some general recommendations if
you watch our technique videos on here
you'll see those but generally speaking
you know there's a lot
of room for individual adjustment to see
which one
produces the most tension in your quads
for example produces the biggest burn
and so on and so forth while minimizing
joint pain or joint discomfort so on and
so forth right
range of motion sometimes if you for
example do flies and your range of
motions here like you don't get a big
pump a big stretch and nothing happens
i don't know my muscle connection sucks
then you get the bright idea to go so
deep
that you're essentially unlocking you're
locking out your
elbows at the bottom and it's just all
biceps and you're like okay that's not
chess so range of motion can be too low
that can be too high but finally you get
something nice in the middle and
it's all packs beautiful right so range
of motion can also be tailored
to maximize stimulus to fatigue ratio
movement of the bar
right some exercises you pull up some
exercises you pull up and back
deadlifts are a good example upright
rows upright rows do you pull this way
or do you pull with your elbows back
well who knows which one has the higher
stimulus to fatigue ratio
cadence right some exercises you could
think suck
but when you slow down the reps they
feel super great you're like man try
some push downs blow and i see you doing
them you're doing this crap
all right but all of a sudden you take
three seconds on the eccentric lock
three seconds in the eccentric lock and
after a set close to failure like oh my
god my triceps and my elbows feel great
awesome it could also work the other way
around some exercises you're doing too
slow you don't really feel it you really
put on the pump and go a little faster
and all of a sudden it works super great
so there's
tons and many many others of these to
using your own training to experiment
with so you can individualize
at the end of the day this goes to
personalize your own training
and that for your clients as well
to make it as good as possible we made
the exercise technique videos that are
on every week on rp and they will be for
a while on the youtube
we made these technique videos to help
you right
and the thing is the guidelines apply to
a bunch of people
but they don't apply to everyone okay
watch these videos and take from them
what you can
general ideas and suggestions but you
gotta personalize the rest
right if a technique that i for example
didn't illustrate in the video
but you changed it a little bit if that
technique is stimulative for you
it is low fatiguing for you then it's
correct for you
do it people ask me like should i do
ladder raises like this
or like that or like that and i'm like
which one do you feel your side belts
the most
and which one hurts your shoulders the
least they're like this one like there's
your answer
right it's not rocket science but it
requires a lot of perception
and requires you not just to be a dumb
animal doing shit but perceiving what's
actually going on and it's not super
complicated
stuff it just takes a little bit of
diligence right
be open-minded and you can change
as your body adapts and changes for
example you used to love smith machine
close
grip inclines but your chest got bigger
your front delts got bigger even your
traps got bigger and now you feel too
bound up
you might have to open up the grip a
little bit and then it feels good again
don't assume
that the same technique is always going
to be the best for you techniques also
get stale
so sometimes you trade off a technique
just because you've been using it for a
long time
as used the same technique for a long
time especially if using too much
same exercise too the stimulus tends to
sort of decline and the fatigue tends to
go up so the stimulus to fatigue ratio
tends to
fall off which is a natural idea of why
variation is a very very good thing for
more details
we have more advanced videos on the
subject they're going to be coming on
youtube they're currently on rp plus as
of the writing of this video rplus is
also currently free so go sign up for
that
folks no dogma take as much out of this
as you can
nothing more all we're concerned with is
your results
folks catch you later and if you are big
batman and superman fan
honestly so am i but vegeta is king
