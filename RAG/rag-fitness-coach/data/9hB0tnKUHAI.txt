chicken broccoli
rice that's how i got big that's how
you're gonna get big
and i'm gonna teach you how i make it
with today's episode of dr
mike's kitchen folks welcome let's get
started
[Music]
some of you may not know this but i did
in fact attend
and graduate with honors from one of
france's premier
culinary academies my french continental
cuisine education
prepared me to make this very dish i'm
making now so
if some of you are having trouble
keeping up with this recipe the
complexity the layers the aroma is
getting tough
hey it's your first time but it's not
mine because i'm a award-winning
chef
from france what does one actually put
into a meal of chicken
rice and broccoli you will be surprised
to know
that a true culinary artist such as
myself goes
above and beyond first of all of course
trifecta my sponsor i use only their
chicken
because it's the finest actually real
talk it's pretty damn good
cutting the chicken first we cut the
package open
then we take one and a half chicken
breasts which is roughly the amount of
protein that i need for this meal
and then we cut them up into little bits
artistically carefully with respect and
mindfulness of where the food came from
you may grab your chicken like a wild
animal throwing it carelessly into the
bowl
i stab it precisely with the scissors to
prepare the cutting process
mortals buy regular broccoli and cut it
themselves i get
pre-cut broccoli slaw chad wesley smith
famous powerlifting coach and exquisite
athlete himself recommended this
there's a reason that
weighs like 350 broccoli slaw
there is a technique to putting in the
broccoli to make sure it layers
finely over the chicken which when the
cooking process occurs
the chicken's aromas and flavors embed
into the broccoli
you guys ready for this artistry
organic pre-made because i don't really
cook
white rice why organic i don't let
chemicals touch my body
come on fam with the rice same idea as
the broccoli we want a
fine evenly distributed layer that means
the way we're going to be applying the
rice
is in a semi-circular fashion
alternating applications to make sure
that everything is filled
and that layer is smooth and roughly the
same thickness
all the way around have you ever been to
san francisco
there's one food you must eat if you're
ever there
it's riceroni the san francisco treat
now you may say it's a corporatized
bs product full of god knows what and i
agree
but it's delicious has low fat high
carbs and those little baby little
noodle things because it's a roni
it's not just rice this is what takes
regular eating push this up a notch
advanced eating how do you prepare
riceroni
now if you're a simpleton fool with no
classical training in cuisine like
myself
you would merely read the instructions
on the back i did no such thing
i took out all of the powdered flavor
let it simmer in its own pan and
cooked the pasta and rice separately
which i also separated
and then reintroduced them all at a
broil can i show you all this
unfortunately i can because a lot of
it's a trade secret but i did it earlier
so now we have it ready
check this out follow me
[Music]
perfect the riceroni
we're going to leave aside for a second
because it's already warm but the rest
of this
isn't quite cooked how would you
normally prepare this you may put it
into a pan you may fry
they saute it you might even air fry it
or
soothe these whatever that is
i don't know
put in the bag whatever anyway
folks
it's the year 2021 there's robots
delivering your packages
we're going to use modern technology i'm
a lifelong learner
in world war ii when i attended culinary
school they didn't teach me the
because the technology straight-up
didn't exist
check out this machine fam you ready
yeah modern technology is amazing
three minutes and 30 seconds later your
meal is almost done
microwave rays go top to bottom
so the rice actually is the most
resistant to heat it needs the most of
them
the broccoli second and the chicken last
if you put the chicken on the bottom
you get an even heating process if you
put the rice on the bottom and you use
the microwave which is the ultimate
chef's tool
then your chicken will
be overcooked and dry but your
rice might even be cold
simpleton
[Music]
two steps left three for being technical
step number one introduce the
rice-a-roni
again the mixing is essential
a real chef doesn't share all their
secrets but
youtube you know i love you guys i'm
gonna share them all
how do you get that extra extra flavor
that oh
that what makes grandma just drop her
spoon hopefully not having a cardiac
event but in shockest oh
the misha this a food at this is so good
yes my gram is actually italian
or russian it is seasoned salt i could
tell you how much to put on
honestly i don't even count it
i can feel connected to the food i know
when it's enough
i know when it's just right
probably watched a couple cooking shows
before and you know that food
presentation is
everything as they say or at least half
the equation because a food can be tasty
but the presentation really brings out
the colors the textures it really
pre-warms the palette
for the kind of expression you want to
impart as really a culinary artist now
that is what i like to call sophomoric c
plus
 real chefs know that in order
to bring out the
perfect taste which it's all about you
need to make
every food you can a homogenous
mixture of nothing that looks like dog
food
[Music]
i don't teach you this in american
culinary school folks
we made an amazing meal didn't we but
what about dessert
now this is my post-workout meal i don't
get dessert but later at night
i get the ultimate dessert of all casein
protein pudding
i'm gonna make it right now for you guys
i'm gonna leave it in the fridge it
hardens
it cools it's delicious let's get
started
three step process folks now careful
attention
because these are quite complex first we
get 50 grams
of casein protein dymatize is a fine
brand
it's whatever jared buys and i steal
from him
[Music]
step two add water
carefully you can always add more water
but you can't take water away
so be ginger about it
and now we mix oh
god does that look good or what
delicious perfection
who needs moose who needs ice cream
now quick story my wife actually likes
some of the powder chunks still in there
but since i'm not a wild
animal i mix it to a fine even puree
i'm gonna try some right now don't tell
my nutritionist
it's so good
[Music]
it's time to consume this wonderful
meal that has approximately 55 grams of
protein 190 grams of carbohydrate
and roughly 10 grams of fat those are
the real macros by the way no
let's see what i've concocted
it's just right
the broccoli crunches
the chicken sizzles
the rice dances and sings folks
i'm a genius no no
you weren't educated in marseille is
that france
got to be right and that's okay
you're not gonna make your food as well
as i do
that's okay you can be inspired by
greatness
just because you're not michael jordan
doesn't mean you can't play a little
basketball and do a little
dribble a little behind the back type
 just the same way
do your very best with this cuisine that
i've presented to you
and when you're eating it be proud
the picture on that season salt's the
closest i'll ever get to being a chef
oh you cut it right in there
ready
smells like burnt yes that's how food
smells
rabb that sounds french right
 art i'm done
