hey folks dr mike isratel back for
renaissance periodization fat loss
dieting made simple video number six
finally finally
purposefully creating a calorie deficit
so hold up we've had five videos so far
what is it that we were talking about in
these five quick review
we sorted out food portions food types
and meals
we're now counting macros on a stable
plan we know what to eat and when
we know pretty much how
much we're eating and maybe we're not
specifically trying to hit certain
amounts of things
especially calories we're just eating to
hunger but we're very well aware because
we're very good at tracking and planning
how much we're eating no not anything
nothing purposeful yet but we're
very very aware of the situation and of
course we know how much water to drink
or fluids to drink
and what kind of supplements we take and
which ones to avoid all from the last
lectures
now this whole process sounds like we do
it instantly
but because we recommended that you sort
of start easy and do maybe one or two of
these things at a time to first learn
you know about how to track your
calories and macros then start eating a
little healthier
then start planning distinct meals so on
and so forth this process for some folks
of getting just to hear from just eating
whatever
can take months okay and that's okay
because of two reasons
first getting used to the approach is
unbelievably important
because if you take this approach with a
calorie deficit it can be
so tough all at the same time to both
learn the new stuff
and impose a calorie deficit failure is
super high but if you learn the new
stuff and get really used to it first
then imposing the calorie deficit is
just kind of like a minor detail
relatively speaking and you have a much
higher chance of success secondly just
from doing all these things
especially eating mostly healthy foods
and eating to hunger not stuffing
yourself
because healthy foods are so much more
filling than junkier foods and we're
eating more healthy foods a lot of time
people will start to lose a ton of
weight and fat
during this sort of onboarding period so
yeah it may take months
but you look at your body weight and
you're like okay three months later i'm
ready to start imposing a calorie
deficit officially
but i'm already down like 15 pounds this
is crazy and i feel
100 fine because i haven't been trying
to do anything i've been pushing my body
in any way of just eating healthier with
a bit more of a regimented schedule
now for many people it will take that
long
months plural for some people it may
only take a few days or a few weeks
especially if they're used to dieting
already so if you know how macros work
and all this other stuff
you're just kind of reviewing this stuff
and you want a real good shot at just a
real good diet you've done tons of diets
before this stuff is pretty simple it
can take you a few days or weeks and
then you're ready
biggest take home from here is don't
rush only start imposing a willful
deficit
when you know you're in a good place and
you know how your body
for lack of a better term how you feel
with the whole process
if eating in this regimented manner is
pretty much second nature to you you're
going to start
if it still feels weird and awkward and
like oh what am i doing and your
trouble measuring and all this other
stuff give it some more time don't
impose a deficit right away because the
deficit
makes everything harder and i do mean
everything all about your life
including your diet so here we go now
once you're used to it once you're here
ready to go you're ready to go
and purposefully try to lose fat two of
the most powerful weapons you have to
this extent
are a caloric reduction via diet of
course which we'll learn how to do here
and a regular weight training and or
activity of any kind that burns fat
retains and builds muscle those two
things
calorie production by diet and regular
exercise are the magic ingredients that
power
all the fat loss all right and the goal
here
will be to lose somewhere between half a
percent and one percent body weight per
week
for somewhere between six to 12 weeks on
purpose until we stop that fat loss
process
to give our body a chance to get a break
to recover to re-sensitize to normalize
potentially we'd have lost all the
weight we wanted but if we have weight
to lose more
then we wait until this whole process
cools down and then we try again
so our first run at a fat loss phase is
going to be between
half a percent and one percent of body
weight per week and between six to 12
weeks now that's generally
for beginners we recommend something
like close to half a percent per week
nice and easy and something like six to
nine week diet for the first try
for more advanced folks which this is
not their first rodeo multiple diets in
very successfully by the way you're not
advanced if you've failed a bunch of
diets you're only advancing you
succeeded
those folks can push up to one percent a
week
which is a lot like if you're 200 pounds
that's two pounds a week that you're
losing
and for nine to 12 weeks and potentially
that's a huge change
and you only graduate to earning the you
know you always have the right to do it
you only graduate to a high probability
of success if you've been successful
with less aggressive diets before
big huge point here they give no bonus
points anywhere in life
for you trying some that's too hard
for you and failing out miserably
when you're gonna try something try the
easy version first if you do really well
success and then maybe you can go harder
later or maybe not i just do mostly easy
diets all the time i just do enough of
them to get to where i need to go
now what about calorie cuts roughly
speaking
very approximate thermodynamics here
from tons of research
is that if you cut 500 calories per day
out of your diet that generally results
in about
one pound of tissue loss hopefully
mostly fat per week
if you cut about 750 calories out of
your diet per day
right so if you're eating 27.50 and you
go to 2000 that's going to at least for
some time
lead to something like a pound and a
half lost per week
and lastly if you are creating a 1 000
calorie deficit from your baseline
maintenance diet
then you're gonna be losing something
like two pounds per week all right
those are just the rough numbers and
then the big question
is how big of a calorie cut should
you make okay to reach your
body weight goals that you want because
you said you have to lose between point
five
and one percent per week how does that
translate to calories it's real simple
you're going to want first thing is your
current body weight
then your weight loss goal per week as a
percent
right then you're going to multiply the
first thing
your body weight by the percent as a
fraction or sorry the percent as a
decimal
and then you're going to multiply that
by 500 calories
what what kind of einstein are we
on super easy example and you can
absolutely just pause the video right
now right after this
look at the screen and the the example
right below tells you exactly how this
works so here i'll just talk through the
example real quick
your current body weight say 150 pounds
so it's 150 pounds multiplied by point
zero zero five
which is point five percent and that's
point seven five pounds
per week of weight loss which is cool
and to generate that we multiply that by
500
stop four and we get 375 daily calorie
deficit
it's that easy so if you weigh 150
pounds and you want to lose
0.5 percent per week you have to create
a deficit
of 375 calories so how do we go about
creating that deficit
first huge point you want to create as
much of that deficit as possible
just by adding physical activity it's
not as long as you're not it's not
taking too much time you're not super
run down
if you can be more active and burn more
calories just by walking or
cycling or anything else you like to do
you can get one of those calorie
trackers
and i use a step tracker and if you can
do there's all these awesome stuff
calculations online for how many steps
cost how many calories based on your
body weight
run the numbers get more steps get more
activity and if you chop off a big part
of that
here's the thing you you lose just as
much fat as you otherwise would
but you get to eat a very similar amount
of food so you want to eat as much food
as possible because that's going to make
you
not super hungry later it's just much
more sustainable also physical activity
burns almost exclusively fat it barely
risks muscle if you take food out of
your diet it risks a little bit more
muscle
and it's super healthy for you so it's
just awesome all around
right it's super healthy super easy less
hunger all that
now the remainder that you just want to
cut from your diet because if you can't
just like exercise more indefinitely
especially if you have a big deficit
you know 750 cal deficit a day you know
adding that in cardio is kind of insane
right especially repeatedly
so what you want to do is cut the rest
out
from your fats okay so you have let's
say 375 and now we have just 200
calories left to cut because at 175
we're doing more activities we
we have 200 calories we want to take
that and cut out however many grams of
fat
right fat is nine calories per gram
we're going to cut out
as many of those fats as we need to take
other
to take care of all the rest of that 200
calories so from our diet
now that's a very good sensible advice
until we get to 0.3 grams per pound
of fats per day so if you're 200 pounds
if you drop below 60 grams of fat per
day
the bad hormonal stuff tends to happen
we don't want to do that
so if we reach our bottom fat limit but
we still have calories to cut
we take the rest out from carbs and we
never touch protein
that's it it's that simple do as much
activity as you can
whatever's left after the increase in
activity personal preference cut from
fats
if you get to point three whatever's
left from fats cut from carbs
done you're done super super super super
simple
now it is super simple especially in the
short term but
maintaining the deficit can be a little
bit difficult your body
might some people's bodies adapt a lot
some not so much but
in general on average bodies adapt to an
imposed deficit
and sometimes they slow down how much
activity you're doing your body
temperature can decline your metabolism
can decline a little bit
your food consumption pattern change or
your actually how much you're actually
eating is a little bit higher than what
you think
all this stuff your body is trying to
get you to not lose weight that's how we
have to have youtube videos to tell you
how to lose weight
this is your body from millions of years
of evolution is designed to try to fight
it
so you may get to a situation where for
more than two weeks in a row
you're not hitting your body weight loss
goal like if your goal is like a pound a
week
and last week you lost 0.8 and this week
you lost 0.6 pounds
on average uh you're not you're not
going to hit your goal that you want at
the end of the diet so then
what you should do is take 250 calories
remove it from your diet and or increase
activity usually by this point your
activity is pretty high
just gonna remove 250 calories from a
combination of fats and carbs
and then voila
that 250 extra is going to push you a
little bit ahead you'll probably start
to lose faster
if two weeks later you're still not
losing at the speed you want or there's
another correction you take away 250
again
and that's just how it works that's it
right
now this video
that we just did gave you the formula
essentially to lose weight
safely and effectively in a six to 12
week amount of time
right now you did have to do some math
and some calculations for some
adjustments
cool thing shameless plug the
renaissance periodization diet coach app
the rp diet coach app which is available
on your itunes store and google play
does this all of this for you it even
plans all of your meals out
and you never have to make any changes
or do any math
when you're not on track you just have
to type into the app how much you want
to lose and by when
and every few weeks the app will be like
hey uh you should probably eat a little
less
uh if you want to lose weight do you
want us to change your diet you say yes
hell yeah keep me on my goal
you click yes and it automatically
changes your diet you don't have to know
anything you just do what it says and
you lose all the weight you want
okay super shameless plug it's 15 a
month super cheap
do you have to get it no hell no you can
do all this by yourself but if you don't
want to the app can help but if not just
use this video and you'll be absolutely
golden
it's easy especially with the rp diet
app but definitely by yourself as well
to plan out to do this right because
none of this is hard
intellectually hard however practically
getting it done
has a few major impediments lots of
people start diets
very few people finish diet successfully
so in the next video
we're going to talk about the very
common known difficulties in dieting
and give you some good tips to weave
around them so you can get all the way
to your successful end of your diet goal
folks we'll see for the next video
next week
you
