[Music]
one more Jared I'm gonna go a little
higher here we go contract this one hard
all the way more Jared more Jared one
more Jared oh
my God ow
[Music]
YouTube what's up I'm Dr Mike from
Renaissance periodization this is Jared
for the ifb pro explained his partial
nudity shortly this is our main man Mr
Andy who is an expert
newbie assisted coach when he reaches
out to activate your muscles electrodes
come out literally of his hands and you
get shocked and parts if you feel
terrible but parts of you feel quite
nice fill in the blanks we are giving
this a shot we have another video on the
channel explaining the upsides and
potential downsides of such a device
I'll ramble about that in just a little
bit where we're seeing if we can add a
little bit of stimulus to Mr Jared
feathers back he has trouble feeling his
back he's trouble connecting mind muscle
connection with those muscles the most
out of his whole body so we're gonna try
to see if this can make a difference and
if he can really feed a little bit more
and he's going to be Mr torture chamber
guy doing the knob and making sure Jared
feels all the right feelings Andy uh
thank you for doing this no problem dude
is there an amount of money I can pay
you to hurt him more
um
you know what I know I'd be happy to do
it for free for free excellent let's
hurt Jared oh that was fast let's do it
now
any area of your back that you want to
specifically like any spot that you have
trouble getting or activating or
anything like that are you pretty good
okay where I just touched you said okay
I'm gonna pad that up then too
so I'll get here and then I'll get uh
I normally do two on the lats
two on the Erectors but since we're
doing mainly you want to do that two
lats two Erectors okay that's cool
oh yes Jared's not wearing underwear I
was waiting for this moment I was hoping
it's always a crap shoot when I'm
patting people up I'm like are they
wearing underwear and I pray to God
they're not
all right I never run away guys
I'm just taking some weight out of the
wires does that make sense yeah I guess
yeah so they're just not hanging yeah
that's cool the key to uh key to being a
great newbie practitioner is wire
management okay it's very underrated
these days yeah if anybody pisses me off
I can just really crunch look at that
Christmas tree coming out without even
trying and he stops trying to get that
shit on my balls
[Music]
[Applause]
workout today first exercise is the
latch prayer AKA straight arm lap pull
down gonna be doing sets of 10 to 20
reps here Jared's technique is going to
be Immaculate and hopefully the Newbie
can electroshock the muscles to get a
little bit more stimulus to those lats
and muscles of the upper and middle back
then Jared could conventionally actually
engage by himself we'll see what Jared
says hopefully some good stuff happens
probably about four sets here let's get
into it
four
three
oh yeah
two
one more Jared I'm gonna go a little
higher here we go contract this one hard
all the way more Jared more Jared one
more Jared
yes
slow
beautiful
holy fuck
wow
oh my God you feel it
that's one way to put it good stop
I'm just touching I know we make fun of
touching the muscle I'm only touching
Jared just because with out of any body
part that's really lumpy the back is so
lumpy that normally I like to put a
really tight compression t-shirt that
way you can just put the pads on and
roll with it and not touch it but where
you know because we want to show how the
back Contracting with the pads so since
he has so many lumps in his back the
pads can get like scrunched so that's
why I'm kind of I'm not feeling the
muscle I'm just making sure the pads are
all flat all right so what's the deal
with these electric stem devices and
training it seems a little hokey and I
totally agree it seems that way and it
actually could be but it might not the
electro stim devices are interesting
because they allow a greater degree of
muscle contraction to occur for any
volitional stimulus that your brain and
spinal cord send down what does that
mean it could potentially potentially
maybe offer us some theoretical
advantages one is because a lot of the
stimulation for the muscle to contract
at least some of it at least more of it
comes from the stem machine itself we
might be in a position where we can do
the same amount of stimulus to the
muscle same amount of muscle contraction
concentric any Centric with a smaller
amount of central systemic nervous
system Drive which means your systemic
fatigue how tired you feel after trying
really hard might be lower for the same
or greater amount of muscular stimulus
that's very interesting there's another
potential benefit where sometimes you
feel like okay I'm doing lap pull Downs
I don't really know what's going on back
there people are really well connected
so their backs can feel the muscles and
even marginally activate some muscles
more than others for other folks like
Jared it's tough to feel the back and
maybe that stimulus independent of your
own abilities can let you feel the
muscles out and then summate your own
Central Drive into it so that it
basically enhances your mind muscle
connection super open-minded here today
supporting your thinking hats and uh
um start thinking 11.
stop 12.
let's go
beautiful
it's good right fucking intense it's
intense right yeah you'll probably
notice like you know the volume will
have to drop oh no 100 I'm already like
like your four working sets will be like
two or three for sure yeah watching them
train people
and training him
using this machine
they actually significantly reduce the
amount of total working sets they can do
because they do have such a better mind
muscle connection but he's been so
diligent
with teaching people really good
technique and I've helped Dandy with
this technique a whole bunch and uh I
think his mrv probably got cut in half
after like I came in and he started
hooking himself up to the machine it was
like two sets on a leg press and have a
crazy fucking quad pump just because of
this so it's pretty cool
but you got to have that already I'm
actually gonna switch the polarity so if
you see we have black pads
black pads are the main pads or the
strong and they send the strongest
signal but what I can do is I can switch
the polarity send a stronger signal to
the red pads still getting a signal to
Black pad say we're hitting the Erectors
and I pad up just the Erectors on the on
the red pads and we're doing a lad
exercise with the back pads once we're
once we're focused on the Erectors I can
send a stronger signal to the Erectors
just from switching the polarity to the
red so we're gonna switch this up and
you're gonna feel it it's not going to
feel as comfortable but you'll feel the
difference okay he's not here for
Comfort man
it feels like actual shocks yeah yeah
everyone's kind of it's like vibrating
my tissue really why don't you feel like
actually shutting up and lifting Mike
coming from you that's hysterical
eight
beautiful Jared
10.
11.
we'll go 12. squeeze try to drive the
driver one more Jared bonus round one
more
try yes slow as if another
oh yeah yeah people know like
I'm like a fucking
technique strickler
this feels like it's giving me something
to work against honestly
it almost keeps my technique even more
strict which is I know that's hard for
me
because it's already so fucking perfect
half man half amazing so maybe we should
take this for Mike's shitty fucking lat
pull down he'd really benefit
[Music]
three sets of lap prayers are done now
it is time for some lat pull Downs
overhand grip Jared is going to do sets
of 10 to 20 again really focusing on the
Mind muscle connection ton of relative
effort close to failure and uh we'll see
how it goes movie time
three
four
five
six well
[Music]
13. okay good I think it's stuck really
quick this would be good for me too like
I have clients including yourself that
use this
this will give me a good idea of just
how
much volume is taking a fucking slap to
the face that's why I really wanted you
to try it man and obviously you know I I
wanted there's three sets here as well
it's gonna be fucking done yeah
we all good
cool man go ahead one
two
looking Jack Jerry if you want to try a
machine like this and you want to use it
to its best possible Advantage first you
bring great technique to Target the
muscle you try to maximize the Mind
muscle Connection by feeling the muscle
do its thing
and you have to bring a ton of relative
effort every set close to failure really
crushing it and grinding it and trying
hard why
because if you don't have a lot of good
technique mind muscle connection and a
relative effort these are all things
that maximize muscle contraction
throughput anyway but if you're gonna
take it easy on those things and then
have the movie make up the difference
then it's really doing work you could
have done yourself would you want a 20
or 30 000 machine like this to do is get
you to that next level
oh
good stuff
I'm back
more beautiful
[Music]
oh there you go
what a drop off
yeah God damn yeah I literally have the
biggest back bump I've ever had in my
life six sets sounds like an endorsement
this is crazy I think you're paid by big
electrics yeah big Andy's been Big Andy
paying me I slipped them I slipped them
500 bucks before the
before we start filming
look at me I'm a freak
[Music]
last exercise is going to be three sets
of machine rows for the machine
and uh this is gonna get the whole back
working and uh we'll see what Jared has
to say so far he's thinking it's blowing
us back up huge pump maybe that is a
little bit of the placebo effect but
maybe it's a little bit of the stem
effect maybe it's a lot a bit of uh both
are either who knows what's going on
that's too rows shut up Mike but I think
what he'll notice is like maybe like
after the second session of this I'll
have a better connection you'll get the
if you talk to Kiara no Kiara just told
me about that Char was like now she
doesn't use it anymore because she's
doing prep she's like I couldn't really
get that that connection with my lats
but we did four workouts back to back
and she's like my connection is night
and day yeah because you can learn the
stuff for later taking the ones here and
putting them on my records is smart you
put those on your fucking bicep dude all
the time animal I would never do that
wow
I think this is a big connection on my
biceps this feels like a bicep on my
back I think the arms and the quads and
the cat calves are the best damn fuck
whoa yep yeah hit the yeah bottom it out
13.
slow eccentric there
Forte milk it yes
15. good
six four left
seven
eighteen
boom
one last one coming up big one
as if another
Big Stretch
shit yeah oh
my fucking god 14.
[Music]
assistant
yes what do you think two more
seventeen
big slow hell yes all the way drive it
beautiful
[Music]
damn training with Bob's and Van Jean
today oh
good shit good shit
he says he's doing something good
oh he's got another set look at how tiny
his back is
actually looking really huge right now
TBH
you got one more set Jerry good to go oh
my master cycle yeah this is more like
12 sets yeah but you'll you'll go back
to training her back without the machine
later and we all
right as rain
11 four more
well
13.
14. two more Jared finish up strong
fuck yeah
all right folks that's the workout Andy
thank you so much for helping Jared out
thank you for having me Jared what are
you thinking uh of the biggest
background I've ever had
probably not a joke in the recent memory
for sure
um
definitely helps with like mind muscle
connection big time
uh push a lot of metabolites just
because the stimulus is constantly going
through the muscle
uh
I might use it every now and again
honestly
this uh oh I won't say that to with too
much confidence based on one session but
this is definitely fucking crazy so the
verdict is worth a try worth a try
absolutely yeah there you go it's fair
all right folks if you're in the Las
Vegas area
Andy 100 does train people with this
thing and uh if you tip him an extra
hundred dollars it doesn't have to go on
your muscles and that's the last thing
I'll say yeah I'll see you guys later
