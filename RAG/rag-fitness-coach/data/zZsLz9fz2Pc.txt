this meeting is being recorded it still
psychs me out i'm not used to it
folks weekly q a is back
dr james dr mike we got a little off
schedule but now we're back baby dr mike
how's it going
it's good man i can't wait to dig into
our first person's questions
me too i got some i got some love and
some hate for wearing that uh
queensland jersey last week but i'm glad
to see we had so many
australian fans and rugby fans in
general yeah
aussies we're with you oy
all right shall we bring up our first
caller
let's do it david
be
okay so david says
hey doc what do you think about using
the greasing the groove method as a tool
for recovery
basically some people claim doing a few
sets every day of for example push-ups
and pull-ups far from failure we get
blood flowing through the muscles and
thus
helps beat up recovery also in what
effect would greasing the groove have on
volume landmarks
should i be concerned about lowering my
motorcycle volume if i plan on using
this method
they can advance much love from
machiadonia
oh it is done isn't it it is david
almost
nice so
where do we start from here let me give
my leia land
james and you can you can give your
stick so sounds good
you know it's like from uh uh greasing
the groove probably does two things if
you do it very low volume and low
intensity it can actually enhance
recovery
uh that's a marginal effect it's not
huge probably enhances your day-to-day
recovery week-to-week recovery
at the expense of long-term months style
joint
stuff so some balance to play with that
but i would say if you have to get
somewhere real quick
then you practice very often sometimes
you practice loaded sometimes on load
so it can do that in addition because
it's practice it probably makes you
nervous system way better at the
movement
so you actually increase your numbers on
the bench press or
let's say you do more numbers on
push-ups and pull-ups because your
technique is better because you're more
well-practiced at it
you can coordinate nervous system better
i would say there's a small window in
which that all works really well
and then it's very easy to go off the
other side where you just do too much
and then you're not recovering very well
so what i would say
is uh there should be pulsatility to
your training anyway
so i would say give a really good
overloading stimulus it might take you
three days to recover
between day you're one and three you
could go in and do just do very very
unchallenging work for technique
essentially
that way you get sort of the best of all
worlds i wouldn't do this all the time
because it does wear on your joints it
does psychologically stress you a lot
it's just
so you know there's a situation where
you uh you essentially get
psychologically bored
with the same kind of training gee whiz
grease in the groove makes that real
happen real fast
so what i would say is greasing the
groove is a great method for
uh what you could say is sort of a
concentrated loading mesocycle
where you really put all in for that
fitness characteristic to try to
maximize as much as possible
with the understanding that the next
mesocycle or two measures later you're
going to really back up away from it and
give it time to heal give the joint
structures time to heal
give yourself some novelty in order for
those adaptations to be realistic
after that um and as far as what
volume landmark effects it has it'll
probably increase your mrv substantially
uh you know even integrate it in with
the extra work
because you get so good at recovering
it'll probably lower your maximum
adaptive
uh sorry it'll raise your maximum
adaptive volume so you'll have to do
more volume to get the same gains
but luckily you're doing a lot more so
you're getting very good gains possibly
higher gains for a short period of time
and it really does raise your minimum
effective volume substantially
because if you get really used to doing
something you get real good at it you're
going to need a lot more of it to cause
a change
so it's by no means it's probably the
least efficient way to train
like hey train this all the time
sometimes hard sometimes not and the
benefit is you get marginally better at
it for a month or two
and then it flatlines so it's exactly
what we use
as a temporary strategy to really push
something ahead and then we back off and
do something else
um this there's a special case for this
for specific training modalities which
necessarily require a lot of time
between hard training sessions so like
jiu jitsu or wrestling or kickboxing you
just can't go hard all the time
a hard session fucks you for a certain
number of days between that you can
grease the groove but that's all the
sports train anyway
they just have lighter practices and
they do drilling and stuff like that
it's the same principle as greasing the
groove so
i would say for hypertrophy it offers
almost no benefit
for strength that offers a considerable
benefit in the short term not the long
term
and for sport training it's kind of
something you do all the time james
yeah yeah you did a really good job
there i'm going to revisit some of those
points because uh
they're worth discussing a bit more um
so greasing the groove
there's definitely like a hint of truth
to this right and this is something that
we've talked about in our recovery
strategies talks
where doing some light training can
actually definitely improve your
recovery
however this is taking that idea a
little bit too far right so in this case
using that like essentially everyday
style of
doing some type of movement what you're
doing is eliminating the potential for
having really really overloading
training on some of those days
and just taking a very very minimal if
if not totally ineffective training
stimulus every day so
one of the problems you run into with
this method is kind of
a lot of junk volume right where you are
maybe feeling pretty good but you're
also just not training that hard you're
not really making
any progress just because you don't have
that pulsatility as dr mike said so in
this case
you're sacrificing some of those days
that could be like really really good
and stimulative
for a lot of instances of maybe mev or
even less training in many cases so
in that regard it's maybe not as good
for hypertrophy
one thing that i think which doctor
might kind of touch down at the end
there
where this is really helpful is in sport
training specifically for
developing skills and tactics so the
reason
why we wouldn't necessarily want to do
it for something like strength or
hypertrophy all the time
as dr mike said you might get a quick
short-term benefit but in the long term
you start to accrue more adaptive
resistance because you're repeating the
same stimulus more frequently than you
otherwise would so
basically you'll start pla you'll see
rapid gains and then you'll plateau out
really really fast and then you need to
vary more often
go for it james real quick just to put
on your point a lot of the guys that
advocate greece in the groove not all of
them not all of them not
meant as an insult they're like sort of
intermediate slash beginner
intermediates
that have done it for a month and
they're like you guys you guys my bench
went up by 50 pounds and it's true it
really does happen
where are those guys the world
championships where are they they don't
exist
because they go from 350 to 400 squat
asap
and then they stay 400 410 400 410 like
the regular rest of us and if they try
to grease the groove again
they end up having hurt knees and hurt
back and you're like oh shit i actually
can't swap this off then long term
so it ends up being like it's almost the
same path to the same place
you just get there faster and pay a
little bit of a risk
of cost of going and doing too much and
having your joints get fucked up so
concentrated loading is the best way to
think about this necessarily short-term
strategy sorry james
i just had to say that because a lot of
people are like we see the groove's
incredible it works for me it's
like you know you look at the guys
youtube and it's like some 13 year old
kid like what up let me know when you
show up to worlds and beat everyone
yeah it's the same thing with like small
love like small off put so much like
on my squat but then i died um yes you
know same idea
and then kind of just to wrap it up like
i think in the areas of sports skills
and tactics it's very useful but here's
the kind of catcher on that
in that those things as you do them so
frequently they tend to improve
really i would say not rapidly but
steadily so although you might be doing
kind of the same things
you are getting incrementally better at
them whether it's technically
or kind of in terms of how sharp you are
meaning like your reactive or predictive
ability
or your ability to integrate those
skills into new tactics that you are
still learning and refining
so you kind of have some variability
into that built in because you're doing
it so frequently
you're making steady progress and you're
able to start doing incrementally more
challenging things
over time that's sport training anyone
who's ever done sports before knows oh
yeah like
when i first came to rugby practice i
was learning how to pass and catch the
ball
next thing i knew i was running and
passing and catching the ball next thing
i knew there was a i was playing against
the defender
that's that that's exactly that right so
no brainer there
but for kind of training underlying
fitness characteristics
as dr mike already laid out you know
maybe not the best way to go about it in
that case kind of
concentrated loading and or like just
having pulsatility in your program gets
that same effect
without compromising the adaptive
potential of that train
beautiful next up is forest nash
of forest nash fitness we've got a lot
of votes on his
all right well done forest says hi docs
what would you say is a realistic ratio
of muscle
mass to fat mass someone might gain or
moderate caloric surplus gaining 0.25
percent of body weight per week for
example
assuming they manage the training
nutrition recovery pretty well how much
would the ratio
uh change for a beginner intermediate or
advanced trainee with average genetics
convert various ratios to around like 50
50 muscle to fats
25 muscles 75 percent fat by interested
to hear your take on the subject yes i
totally understand if the idea
uh it's not productive to focus too much
on expectations of progress
rather just do the best we can let the
results fall where they may but this is
a question i get from clients sometimes
and i would like to be able to give
more informed answer even it's just a
ballpark estimate many thanks for all
the great content so the first thing i'm
going to say is we're going to take
beginners and we're just going to throw
them right out of the discussion
the next group people are going to take
out of discussion is people that use
drugs or using more drugs than usual
guys will say like hey man gain 20
pounds fucking last prep like sweet you
went from four i used to eight i use
with your growth hormone it's not it's
not neat trick you know everyone knows
how to do that well
everyone uh everyone's an exaggeration
but you know the pertinent people that
can do that can do that okay so there's
there's not much to say there
however for sort of the average folks
who are drug free and sort of
intermediate
you know advanced i don't want to talk
about advanced because it's even more
depressing but you know let's just
stick to sort of drug-free intermediates
uh i'll throw some numbers out these are
guesses
wild guesses but they're informed
guesses because james and i have been
around the block
i'm gonna throw my guesses out i'm gonna
caveat them and then james will let us
know what he thinks about my guesses and
see
maybe it's different now remember
there's a huge variance here so some
people gain much less than this some
people gain much more
and and it's totally fine and so again
but to your point forest you're very
good at saying that look like i don't
even know if this is useful people just
keep fucking asking you
so one of its you know sort of the
reasons it's not as useful is because
it's a huge variance anyway so it's kind
of like yeah like
you know how much does a car cost in
america i don't know like anywhere
between
fifteen thousand and seven hundred
thousand dollars like
somewhere there's an average but it's
not gonna really say much so okay so
here's the deal
um i think if you're getting 50 50
muscles of fat
you're doing real well for yourself
that's real well for yourself and
up to as low as 25 muscle 75 fat is
really just fine you're doing great
okay 50 50 is real good right so if we
take a look at
point two five percent of body weight
per week uh then
let's say we take that out for a month
that's one percent per month
and then let's take that up for four
months that's four percent body weight
and let's say you weigh 200 pounds
that's what eight pounds
right so 200 pounds over the course of
four months if you gain
four pounds of muscle that's really good
that's really good you might be able to
sandwich two of those in a year eight
pounds of muscle in a year is
real good and if you gain only half of
that still
two pounds and then four pounds in a
year so four pounds of muscle in a year
is real good stuff that's kind of what
the average immediate is going to gain
anyway
that's just like bar for the course so i
would say if you're doing something like
oh man 95 to 5 or 90 to 10
yeah you know again code totally
realistic that could just be you
but uh you know if that really is the
case then james and i were your coaches
we would zoom in on what you're doing
wrong first
because we would assume maybe you're
doing something wrong but maybe that's
just your genetics and that's how the
cookie crumbles
if you claimed that you got 100 or 75 25
in favor of muscle the fat would be
highly skeptical but then we'd look into
it if that was true we'd be like we'll
get you just a great genetic responder
you did a lot of the right stuff
so i would say 50 50 to 75 25
somewhere where many people will land i
can't say most i don't have statistical
data back that up but i see a lot of
people
so if you're doing 50 50 i would be
super happy and if i was doing
25 75 i'd be like yeah this is great you
know things are going really well
what i would really really advocate
people not to do is expect
100 or fall for the the main gaining
maintaining myth that you could just
keep the same body fat percentage for
years
and just add on muscle really fast like
that means you're you know gaining like
you know that's probably like a 75 25
ratio or something right so
you know yes it's okay to gain fat a
substantial amount of fat and even if
you gain half at or
three three quarters fat once you diet
that off there could be a lot of muscle
there
and that's totally fine totally to be
expected uh james
i'm glad so i was like okay pick numbers
before dr mike starts talking and let's
see if we were on the same page and we
were so i was saying
in my mind i was thinking like a median
value for like
not particularly good or like less good
would be like
35 65 right so we were seemingly pretty
much in the same
mindset and 50 50 is definitely doable
but it's like definitely that probably
the upper end of
the pace that i've experienced with
myself or my clients like
like like mike said if you're if you're
claiming more than 50 i'd feel like
maybe maybe not but definitely like
between that 50 and 25 so i would i was
going with a median of like 35 to 65 is
kind of what i would expect unless they
were like
um like my friend steve who's just like
as slow twitch beanpole as it gets he's
my best bud in the world but he's been
lifting for a couple years and
he's just a slow gainer right and then
you just look at that person you can you
just know like okay i can
doesn't take a sports scientist to tell
you that this is a slow twitch kind of
kind of person and they're not maybe not
going to be at that 25
75 mark maybe they'll be a little bit
less than that but that's to be expected
at that point
yeah we'll take anything we can get at
that point yeah exactly
okie dokie moving on to henrik anderson
you son of a bitch henrik
come on ah too many control ah get out
of here
are you fucking kidding me
there we go boom
can any of the following things listed
below be harmful or unhealthy so first
of all yes
everything can be harmful i was going to
say all of those are unhealthy
yeah but we'll we'll simplify for you
hendrick we'll say like uh
are they very likely and do we really
need to take a lot of uh caveats to make
sure they're not
harmful it's like saying can brushing
your teeth result in death actually yes
can skydiving result in death like well
yeah you really should be pretty careful
about skydiving
brushing your teeth you really gotta try
to get killed right so um
and he says what about not fully
developed physical individuals
such as myself we'll focus on that for
the discussion we won't talk about
regular people
so 16 years old um all right so
systemic and or local overreaching is uh
so i'll do my first and james will do
his
hopefully i don't get too much wrong um
systemic and or local overreaching is
probably a very minor concern you'd have
to really fuck up to get yourself
you know in some kind of trouble um you
know the way we really see that is
more like heat deaths you know and
american football we don't really see
much obviously
rhabdo is possible but you really gotta
try and be super stupid about it
massing uh i was very unlikely to be
harmful and healthy especially if you're
actually messing and not just eating
cookies and getting up to 350 playing
playstation
i would call that massing so massive is
actually very healthy for young folks
cutting can be potentially uh sort of
unhealthy
especially if you get very lean for very
long you try to really reduce your body
weight
like i know some people who in wrestling
basically gained almost no weight in
high school
uh because they were trying to make the
same wrestling class all the time that's
really fucking stupid
it absolutely will impact the degree of
your neural development to some extent
most that catches up maybe not all of it
um definitely impacts your adult height
and can give you unique bone conditions
and all sorts of problems later
i do not like cutting very much for
anyone under the age of 18. i'm really
not a big fan of it i think the best
that you just answer a question no one
asked um
everyone nothing dr mike answers
question
um my favorite response to that mean you
know when they say like nobody and then
there's a colon that's nothing said
i'd be like well actually nobody didn't
say anything so why are you including
that just say what you want to say
stupid motherfucker you don't know
nobody doesn't isn't even paying
attention in any case
cutting my formal opinion on cutting is
if you are over fat at age under 18
what you should be doing is eating
healthy and taking lots of physical
activity you don't look at the scale
you just do that and if that results in
weight loss cool if it results in you
just maintaining weight and then your
body growing into the rest of the weight
as you grow and hide in muscularity
that's even better so at purposeful
attempts to lose weight
really just not a great idea for people
under the age of 18. once you're 18 or
over and
it's really just to do whatever the fuck
you are constant body weight
fluctuations always gaining or cutting
if that doesn't involve really nasty
cuts like if you gain 15 pounds and you
cut 10 gain 15 cut 10.
it's totally fine totally fine mild
caloric restriction has absolutely no
harmful effects on individuals your age
but really nasty and pervasive
restriction absolutely does
uh that's that's all i got on that james
what do you think how did i do i thought
you did great so i'm kind of going to
piggyback off of dr mike's sentiment and
really i feel like
most um most people under 18 really
shouldn't be doing
really formal dieting right it's more
about like developing like mike said
good healthy eating habits and kind of
if you have some if you're somebody who
is
maybe getting scouted for you know
potentially playing like d1 sports or
something
that's something you can tackle as you
get into your collegiate years but if
you are
like middle school high school age you
would have a really hard time convincing
me that anybody who is otherwise healthy
needs to think about massing or cutting
at that point
learning healthy eating habits getting a
good relationship with exercise
hydration
your body weight things like that and
going from there so
that being said the other one that kind
of comes to mind here is systemic and
local overreaching and i don't think
it's i mean all of these things are kind
of inherently unhealthy it's maybe not
in your
always in your best interest to do but i
think that level of training
is also unnecessary for somebody at that
age group because you were effectively a
beginner unless you started lifting
weights when you were like 12 which
pretty much nobody does so at that point
like the
the pushing your body to the point of
overreaching is very likely
unnecessary and could actually be
counterproductive in many cases so as
somebody who is you know i would say
adolescent or teenage years learning
about lifting and getting into lifting
you should be leaving a little bit on
the table and that is probably in your
best interest not only for performing
well if you're
doing like high school athletics but
also in terms of just maintaining
some of that adaptive potential that you
want over time and not burning yourself
out unnecessarily
so that by the time you get to college
or adult age like you already have like
fucking knee and back and hip issues
like you don't want that
so um i would say masking and cutting
kind of
unnecessary systemic and or local
overreaching
unnecessary and then that basically
eliminates the bottom one anyway so
kind of the idea of being train hard
learn about the techniques learn about
the methodology of
methodology of training excuse me learn
how to eat healthy
and monitor your body weight and kind of
go from there once you get into more
competitive athletic endeavors then you
can start dabbling in those things as an
adult but
pre i would and it's kind of arbitrary
in some ways right you're saying like
what's the difference between 18 and 17
well it's two you know it's one year
it's it's somewhat arbitrary but i do
think that it is a good kind of
vague landmark that we can use we say
like 18s
and adults you can make your own
decisions at that point 16 you're still
developing i mean frankly you're still
developing
into your 20s in many cases so i think a
lot of those things are unnecessary
altogether
totally
next up is rhino
say what rhy
[Music]
got it dear doctors
did the cute lady next to me at the
mirror see that i took the 12 kilogram
dumbbells for my laterals
instead of the 10 kilogram dumbbells
rhino
i can make this much more particular of
an answer she didn't just
see you do it she didn't want
to feel you do it but she did she was
hit with a wave
a la women's reaction to elvis presley
and his prime
i forgot where i was i forgot what my
name was
i can't feel my legs i want to give
myself
over to this megalith of a man and
just have him set me straight just be
with me
can i smell a part of your clothing just
leave me a piece of your clothing and
just be on
with what you're gonna do in this life
whenever i meet my husband eventually
and have children
i can have my little rag of your
clothing and some kind of tiny little
like dresser and i take it out every now
and again
and i just smell like oh my god oh my
god oh my god real ultimate manhood
exists and now i know that it does
because of 12 kilogram dumbbells
especially if you kind of were like
walking over to the tents and did one of
these like
and then you did the 12s instead and hit
reps at the same rir
my god because she's been watching you
the week before she knew what your rar
was she's like yeah but it's a technique
and a whole solid
and she's like oh my god oh my god it is
i can't believe i did that
i would propose marriage to this man but
i don't feel myself worthy
you may actually not be getting laid
because women
aren't feeling like they're up to the
challenge nobody really likes to get you
know
shot down you know so she's just like
i'm just going to be on my merry way
living my mortal life here in the
presence of a god
that's the sad part about gym life as a
man where you think like yeah once i get
buffed
all the ladies are going to be all over
me but what happens in actuality
all the dudes everyone's like wow great
job bro you're dead what's your mrv for
delts god damn
i like the oddly technical question
all right next up is full
just type in plastic james i'm not
reading this plastic
plastics j91 that sounds like some kind
of jet fuel firm
yeah it does from an exotic fighter so
yeah like
actually i got to look him up myself oh
you've got him pulled up okay
he says hey docs mike you've talked
recently about how the different cardio
modalities can interfere with lifting i
do a lot of walking
basically discovered in my
cardiovascular endurance is really poor
since i don't regularly engage in more
intensive cardio modalities do you have
any advice for how someone might
improve their cardiovascular endurance
while native mining
managing interference so what i'm going
to say for james is answering the
question of how poor your endurance
really is how you know that why that's
relevant
i'm sure james has a lot to say about
that but let me just give you two really
cool videos to try
um that will give you a lot of insight
on this because we do already actually
have these videos out
and they answer a shitload of your
question and probably more
so one thing you want to google is
preventing muscle uh loss on a cut
colon cardio strategies rp video tons of
stuff on there
and then another one just called lifting
versus cardio these are all rp videos
they're all recorded relatively a short
time ago
and they really talk about the
trade-offs and especially the
cutting one tells you look if you don't
want to lose muscle here's how you go
about cutting on cardio
like it really just answers your
question directly almost
if you want more cardiovascular
endurance
you'll see in the two videos that
there's a spectrum more endurance also
demands all sorts of
things from you less endurance demands
less and interferes with lifting less
so you just have to slide that scale a
little bit over and just try to keep the
impact really low
so my my just off the cuff
recommendation if you are going to watch
those videos later
is i would just do lots of either um
difficult swimming
or elliptical work because both are very
very little impact if any
and they really systemically target your
cardiovascular endurance and i would do
them relatively far away from your
lifting
uh in such a way that it doesn't even
impact recovery right after
an adaptation right after nor does it
make you tired and impact the magnitude
of sleeping that's right before
uh that's my my concern there james what
do you think
yes you kind of hit it on the head right
at the the preface of that question
which is
how do you know you know that your
cardio is not you know appropriate and
why do you want it to be
better and so to me if i kind of
contextualize that that makes me think
that
something in your daily life makes you
feel like you're out of shape
that's my guess otherwise like you're
just doing cardio for its own sake so if
you're just sitting around thinking like
i need more cardio
the question really is is like do you
need more cardio and if the answer is
like well no i just want more cardio
and that's fine too then you can
actually train for cardio but just know
ahead of time and
this is going to be well covered in
those videos dr mike mentioned there's
just trade-offs that you have to make at
that point because you can't just train
everything
and expect not one of those assets
excuse me one of those
training variables to budge a little bit
right so that's why we have the volume
landmarks to kind of dial those in and
say if i add
cardio that means i got to take away
from lifting at least a little bit
and that's how we kind of balance those
things out but i'm guessing that there's
probably something in your life that
you're doing
maybe it's going upstairs or walking to
work or doing
yard work or something that makes you
feel like you're out of shape and in
those cases what i have found
is that sometimes just doing more of
that stuff whatever it is that you feel
like you suck at actually it's just a
very fine alternative to doing more
structured cardio
if the purpose is not specifically like
endurance training for something
specific like if you want to be able to
run a long distance well
there's there's not really any way
around it you got to go do some running
but if you just want to not feel like a
fat piece of shit when you take off the
garbage
you can essentially do kind of like i i
hate saying this but it's kind of like a
mini strong man type activities around
the house like that's what i do out here
in montana
i got all these goddamn logs i gotta cut
all of the time i do basically
lumberjack strongman all the time and
that's my cardio i just treat it as my
cardio
get my heart rate up a little bit and
does it interfere with my lifting sure
but at the same time i've recognized
that that is a trade-off because i'm
doing quote-unquote some kind of cardio
activity
and that's what i use it for and then
when i go and actually have to do it
if i uh because we like for example we
cut like eight trees down recently and
had to get rid of all those goddamn logs
i don't feel like a fat piece of shit
because it's just part of my normal
routine so
i would say you might be able to kind of
contextualize any of those activities
where maybe you feel bad and maybe it's
something as simple as walking or going
up and down stairs like
just do a little bit more of that every
week and see if you get better at it
maybe you can wear a weighted vest
when you walk or when you do a light
weighted vest
don't don't put on like a 70 pound best
put on like a 10 pound vest
go from there and just do stuff like
that again keep in mind like if it's
just for
feeling better with your activities of
daily living it's one thing if it's
training for endurance in a specific
modality that's just a different thing
and then there's different trade-offs
with both of those
also be less fat that always helps
it helps huge um
all right next up tired of writing just
phenomenal science fiction novels daniel
brown
daniel asks us a question about being a
personal trainer
all right yes daniel says hey doc i'm a
personal trainer i'm often limited doing
one-hour
training sessions with clients how would
you go about increasing volume for
clients over a measure with a limited
time thanks well fundamentally you
really can't
unless you want to trade off something
else and so there's one way to do them
it's normally when you start with
clients a lot of your sessions involve
technique learning that's not very
stimulative and then some stimulative
sets
as you go weeks and months with the same
client you end up having less technique
learning and more like hey like you're
warmed up let's fucking crush it because
you already know how to do good
technique
so that is a sort of automatic way to
increase the volume but of course it
doesn't last
uh if someone's a if you're training
someone for years they know all the
exercises already and we need to learn
technique
their volume is now primarily dependent
on how long they'd be in the gym and how
many sessions they have what you can do
is you can talk to the clients and say
look like you told me you want a big
chest and big arms they're like yes
you only come in twice a week which is a
lot of time for us to work but
you can benefit from three times a week
i can physically make it bigger now if
it's worth the extra hundred dollars
a week to you great if it's not then i
just want you to know you understand the
tradeoffs right
and then all of a sudden you're like
okay great it's like when you go to the
dentist you're like hey do i need to
brush my teeth after every meal he's
like yeah let me tell people that
no but at least brushing once a day and
if you don't even if you brush
like once every other day or something
at least floss for the love of god
but they'll give you a spectrum of like
shit you can do and how much you can get
out of it so
you want your clients to understand that
like yes more is better but it's not
necessarily better for their
level of trade-off and at the end of
that as long as you're not resting
excessively between
exercises something as long as you're
not blabbing uh that's a great way to
increase volume is blab less uh then
you're kind of uh impinged on that
that's it you just have to do as good of
a job as you can
and if you still want really great
results for a specific muscle group you
got to prioritize that muscle group
you got to make sure to put it at the
beginning of every workout and hit it
every single workout
let's say you train twice or three times
a week if your client wants a big back
it's back first
three times a week uh different kinds of
back movements hard and then you know
all the other stuff is
kind of more maintenance and that's just
an inherent limitation
uh james yeah that's really good and
then sometimes like
you know you might have clients who
maybe just can't afford to take multiple
uh other sessions with you throughout
the weekend so one thing i used to do
when i was personal training was just be
like
how do you feel about like what we've
been doing do you have a good grasp on
kind of how things generally work and
like could you
just come in a third day per week and
maybe hit like the chest press machine
and the tricep machine
and then just do that on your own is
that like feasible for you and more
often than not
people will say oh yeah like i feel
pretty good like if you say can you come
in and do squats and deadlifts they'll
go
no i'm not doing that by myself right
but if you say like can you just do this
thing that's pretty easy like
like a pull down or chest press any of
the kind of basic machines and they have
a feel for things like
rir and how many reps that they should
be kind of shooting for and if they have
kind of a grasp of what you've been
doing with them then you can just say
hey why don't you come in this third
time this week or maybe a fourth time
and just do some of these basic things
and you don't have to have me with you
because like you don't need me here to
do cable curls or tricep push downs and
stuff like that
totally james that's a really good point
i just want to just real quick on it
if you give your clients the option of
doing work on their own
versus making them come in and charging
them they're going to really buy into
you a lot of the times because they're
going to be like oh my god like
like these guys it doesn't want money he
just wants me to get results they'll
they'll
you'll get incredible results they'll
refer like 50 trillion clients to you
and then you'll be rich like legit like
we back when nick shawn and i did
personal training before we started rp
we gave all of our clients a talk and if
they wanted it we gave them stuff to do
outside of the gym
and we said you only need to come in and
see us two to two to three times a week
you could be training five times a week
and crushing it will just give you some
many goals to accomplish
some of them were like nah you know i'm
just better off just doing it with you
and some of them had some degree of
success
getting on it so this thing yeah
yeah totally all right next up is
lorenzo
vroelk that's i would say yeah
hilariously enough in russia that last
name would just be funny just sounds
funny
lorenzo always makes me think of lorenzo
llamas like oh yeah
like look i'm straight as an arrow you
know but if
renzolas came at me i'd be like look
i've got all sorts of confusing thoughts
in my head i'm
trying to recite christian verses uh
just do the right thing do the right
thing do the right thing
don't make out with lorenzo llamas i
keep telling myself
don't don't make it don't make out with
him he's sitting he's like sitting next
to you on a plane you're like don't
worry he's like
this is really big and i sure hope he
doesn't try anything and i like don't do
it again just don't let it happen again
he's like jesus christ have i hooked up
with this guy before
like oh hi sir do you he seems like you
recognize me like god don't talk to me
i'm thinking out with you
i loved all the movies you were in and
the series i loved uh hercules
um what was that other one where that
native american gentleman had the hummer
um oh fuck that's gonna bother me now
yeah well we're all of them we're not
going to go down this route i'm just
going to google it right now
lorenzo lorenzo llamas american actor
it's great thank you imdb uh let's see
what is he known for imdb
imdb time to be come on come on
he's known for all right so hold on
he's uh his father was argentinian and
his mother was american of norwegian
descent of course he's the ultimate
human of course
um oh he's been doing a lot of shit
lately that sucks
i'm trying to scroll down to the earlier
shit that was relevant he's been in shit
this entire time good god uh
now i'm gonna look this up when we sign
off invasion america what the fuck
renegade that's what it was
oh yes yes
god damn the 90s was a wild time wild
time
all right all right lorenzo rolick asks
calf raises is it better to do them all
standing all them sitting a mix
or does it not matter i was under the
impression that doing them in a sitting
position
places the gastroc in a position of
active insufficiency correct it's
targeting more of the soleus
but how useful is targeting the soleus
when it does the gastroc that makes your
calves look so juicy
so it kind of depends what your calves
are shaped like sometimes guys will have
really big gastrocs at the top but then
like no soleus so it just goes
like that and then it kind of looks like
you have like a shank down there like
robot legs
which is like a cool look a lot of
people want a lot of gastroc development
and at least some soleus development
good news you get a bit of both
when you do calves in various rep ranges
um if you
really want to dot all your eyes and
cross all your t's you may do like once
or twice
a week uh just for a few cents do seated
calves just to really get the soleus i
would highly highly highly recommend
doing it for higher ups because there's
predominantly slow twitch muscle
probably doesn't you know it grows fine
from a lot of load but you probably grow
well with higher reps and get much less
fatigue um and uh but i never do
and uh i think my my calves have been
going really well
almost no bodybuilders do most of the
time when people deceited calves
it's because they want to use a lot of
weight on something with a really
partial range of motion and sort of
check the box of having
done calves and they get to sit down
doing it the problem is the gastroc gets
almost entirely uh no activity and then
you don't actually grow big calves like
that so yeah almost all standing
you want to dot the eyes to cross the
t's with sitting you can i would do a
very small amount of it because it gets
hit with standing anyway
yeah and that's the thing they've shown
in some pretty interesting kind of emg
studies now emg is not perfect but
if you do kind of standing or we'll say
mostly straight-legged kind of uh calf
variations you hit the gastroc really
hard
and you hit the soleus pretty darn hard
too maybe not as
ideally as if you did like a soleus
specific bent knee version
but you get enough just spill over on
both of them that's kind of
a very efficient way to train calves
with a straight relatively straight leg
it's like there's not really any
incentive to do it any other way
unless just for having some extra
variation or you have just really shitty
soleus muscles
yep all right next up
is to quote the devil from south park
chris chris
he had kind of like a mini list
so
it was like so bad that satan thought he
was too much he's like jesus christ
what's wrong with you he's like i love
it here
dude their like love triangle was so
funny
oh yeah the triangle so much as yeah
like he just kept murdering satan's
boyfriend
that's right and they like realized that
because he wasn't hell he couldn't
murder him he would just come back but
like morally it was still bad
this guy again he's where was i gonna go
hell he's like
i guess you're right dude south park's
amazing
all right that's probably one of my
favorite all-time quotes is when
uh they were that ritalin episode where
everyone had quote-unquote add yes
and then the christine aguilera monsters
were just like a random thing you'd get
as a side effect
and she literally comes up and karma was
like what the hell and she's like he's
like
she didn't really have anything to say
this is like get out of here christina
aguilera monster
imagine being christian aguilera in that
tv if i was like that was me
i was like oh it's a doctor mike monster
i was like i would have been laughing
for like five years straight
what an honor yeah christina aguilera
looks like she's been
outside against her will for too long
jesus christ james that's a hell of an
endorsement
i will say though bitch can sing yeah
holy shit i'm saying her ass off yeah
she's her and uh lady gaga are like oh
professional level
i'm a lady gaga fan yeah could easily be
like in
fucking opera but like could hear that
all that bullshit that vibrato the range
all that shit it was like britney spears
is a fine singer
but mostly you know just does the
hormone thing which is you know
excuse me oh
like yeah can we do this song but with
less sex the whole production crew is
like uh yeah that's not really uh
she was like the disturbed of pop music
with those fucking noises
disturbed what an honor yeah i mean
they're
basically the same all right
chris fraith says dox what do you think
for the first mess of a block
uh doing only sets of five to 10 and 10
to 20 for certain muscle groups would
you be missing out on optimal
hypertrophy gains
would that be offset by a greater
potentiating effect once you include
or introduce sets of 10 20 30 in the
next mezzo thanks a lot appreciate all
the great info
you guys put out i think that's totally
fine the only thing i would really be
worried about is exercises that like
their sfr
or muscle groups where their sfrs are so
good in the 20 to 30 and so shit and
anything else
that you're like trying to do five to 10
10 to 20 years like this sucks why am i
just doing shitty training
um it's like somebody told you like oh
you only train quads in the two to three
rep range and the next
meso you'll be able to go in the five to
fifteen and you're like well i'm just
gonna guess i'm not gonna grow quads for
this now
time and i might get hurt so there are
some some rare exceptions but some
exercises just
uh some muscle groups just don't not
much happens even in the 10 to 20 range
on the you know 15 to 20 range you get
some good stuff but you're like man i
swear when i go into 20 30 it just blows
my shit up then yeah like if you don't
have any replacements i would make sure
to include some of that
that's the deal yeah and that's kind of
like so like if you read the hypertrophy
book we kind of recommend
having a little bit of everything in
each phase but again it's largely a
matter of
sfr so are you leaving anything on the
table by not doing the 20 30
depends on if 20 to 30 hits the best sfr
for certain muscles right then you
definitely are and it's like well why
are you doing that
well i need to do sets of six for my
calves like okay
have fun with that that's going to be
really great really good example
100 so you know it's um it kind of
depends it's hard to say yes or no
that's why we said like you have a
little spattering of each and then maybe
shift it
shift the emphasis of those ranges
across your mesocycles
and then you take that that kind of
broad notion
and then you say well which are the best
sfrs for my particular
muscles and situations and then you may
be biased even more
in that direction per permeso cycle so
it's only leaving something on the table
if you're just
deliberately taking the worst shittiest
rep ranges for your muscle groups
so just don't do that yeah
next up is andrew attkisson
andrew action
got it he says hi ducks what are your
thoughts on starting cut more
aggressively say one percent rate loss
even more plausibly or possibly for a
few weeks then slowly
slowing down the rate of loss by upping
calories slightly
what are the pros and cons of that and
how would you advise for this
uh thanks uh thank you so much as ever
well so first andrew i think it could be
a fine idea in some situations
um almost all bodybuilding props look
like this
uh you lose a little bit quickly at
first you don't want to lose real fast
at first because it just sums up a lot
of fatigue
um but you may lose more quickly at
first especially if it doesn't require
pushing the system too hard
so if you're like losing fast at first
it requires like heaven and earth
efforts and you're getting super hungry
and super tired early don't do that
but if you're losing fast and you're
like wow just i don't even know i'm not
even hungry i have plenty of energy
just keep doing that until it exhausts
itself what i wouldn't do
is slow down the rate of loss by upping
calories slightly but i think what
happened was the
rate of loss will slow itself down just
in metabolic adaptation and 50 other
mechanisms
and then you might just not cut calories
as aggressive as you would to keep the
one percent
but either leave them to keep a point
five percent or something or cut them
just a little to keep point five
so i would say the rate of loss could
look like this right and that's totally
fine
um is it better than linear there's
probably some ups and downs
one thing i would say is um for you
personally this
could be a fine idea for regular fitness
clients uh personal training clients
diet clients online folks
i'd say like a linear approach is really
good because it allows people to
contextualize what's going on really
well
and it's uh not a second order
complexity problem where they're like
how am i doing and you're like well
check your line and it's a fucking like
fucking exponential curve and they're
like
i guess i'm below the line that's good
you're like yeah they're like this is
not very intuitive it's like so
i was losing a pound a week last week
like is that too much now should i slow
down it's like god damn it
like it just lose a fucking pound every
week for 12 weeks and you'll be good
right you'll die it's a little easier
when you start a little harder when you
stop
but for for someone like you who clearly
knows what they're doing i think it's
totally fine
just don't cut so aggressively at first
um that it feels aggressive if it feels
aggressive at first you're making a big
mistake it should feel easy
if that is or super fast then that's
totally fine and then later you could
just not be as aggressive with the
cutting i'm sure as hell would introduce
more calories later
because that's almost certainly going to
put you up to losing nothing with a
metabolic adaptation james
yeah yeah very very good there dr mike
and i think for somebody like you andrew
the way that this manifests is like you
start a cut after you had been doing
maintenance or whatever for a minute
and maybe you reduce cows and you start
adding like maybe 20 minutes of cardio
per day
and all of a sudden you know like you
just start dropping weight and like mike
said maybe you just like wow i don't
feel it at all
and it's just like enough of a lifestyle
change where you're actually dropping
weight at a pretty high rate not really
feeling any wear and tear that's good
that eventually will slow down and then
you kind of go from there and decide
what you want to do
for your clients and people who are kind
of new
very often the case is like you get them
eating more healthy
just right off the bat and getting more
fruits and whole grains and less
sabaro and macas right and that's sabaro
james babaro is like oh my lord
let me get a reports strong new york new
york city
new york city shithole tourist spots and
airports is the only legal place
tomorrow can exist in america
i've never seen a single organic
american person randomly
say like hey you guys want to hit up
sabaro like you get punched in the face
but that's like you know they work
somewhere like
in the mall and they're like let me go
up to the food court get a fucking
strong bowl for lunch you know
so they start cutting that shit out and
they might see
really really rapid weight loss one from
just like deep loading because they're
eating just
garbage all the time and two maybe
because their diet is just getting so
tidy
so in that case it's good but um i think
like dr mike said
for them to contextualize what they're
doing and kind of see how it works it's
kind
of better just to have like a slow
steady pace for the most part
so a lot of the times i kind of use i'll
use like the first week or two
as kind of a buffering period where it's
kind of like i don't want to say hands
up in the air but like
don't put too much stock in whatever
happens in the first week or two of a
diet whether you've
changed the diet and added cardio or you
have a new person who's never dieted
before
usually give it a week or two and then
start making more more of the
challenging decisions because it's
normal to have
kind of a roller coaster look the first
when you make
major lifestyle changes
okay last for today is
right don't james don't move that dial
oh wth
is that cream that sounds like um
like a hentai person who watches hentai
nonsense james no one of our youtube
users watch enti
we know i said that wrong all of our
youtube users watching that's exclusive
our base is exclusively hentai watchers
i wanna
like there's probably some kind of
correlation you could draw
where the the degree to which a person
says they don't watch hentai is directly
proportional on average to how much they
actually watch
like you ask a typical person like hey
you watch hentai porn the average guy
who like sees it once a month would be
like yeah for sure it's just sweet
and you get to like a real incel and
you're like do you watch untie pointers
of course not depraved i'm not a
degenerate i only have sex with
with blonde shit for tall women
consensually in my hair
you're like oh you only watch half time
you said harem i know you watch hentai
now you blew it
for sure you have not seen a man even in
cartoon form have sex aluminum years
it's all been octopus tentacles all the
way down it's always octopus technical
100 so like there is a separate um you
know like sub genre of anime which is
like
harem anime which is where you have like
of course there is it's like uh you have
the like the the normal protagonist
who's like a 13 year old boy and all
these fucking hot chicks are falling
head over heels for him all the time and
he's like oh these girls are like always
in my business and i'm like oh so and
it's a that's what gave him a that's
what gave that guy away you you use the
word that's in another context
yeah sorry harem guy yeah you don't
actually have a hair
um all right here's the deal
uh he says hi docs what is the effect of
rest times on hypertrophy
i understand it has longer rest times
for example two minutes percent all else
equal result in more operation because
they allow for
uh more ups percent and less growth and
that's more volume
however i was listening back to previous
webinar where mike talked about
effective reps where he said something
like rest times don't matter
that much because while shorter rest
time means lower total volumes
would you be doing more effective reps
and so the stimulus is similar
so is this correct that resting two
minutes between sets and say getting 40
reps total over x number of sets is
roughly similar
in terms of your virtual feed arresting
30 seconds three sets and getting 25
reps over the same number of sets rar
load etc being the same
if not how big is the difference between
the two actually we have it
literally it's one of the very rare
times in sports science where this is
not caveat it's not new
nuance at all you're very very um
confident in this assertion
if the limit to the set
is the muscle itself there is profoundly
little if not
zero relevant uh differences in
hypertrophy
okay per per set percent the rep numbers
and stuff get really weird you just
count hard sets it makes it all
better because it equalizes a lot of
stuff so what do i what do i mean
so james and i have developed uh james
myself and jared have developed a four
factor rest time model
and if you weren't such a fucking in
great what the fuck is that cream
you have read our fucking book god damn
it yeah
how dare you no how dare you ask us
these stupid fucking questions um no but
as a serious note the book super
explains the shit out of this and
there's multiple youtube videos we have
an rp which like literally just type in
like
four factor rest model is retell or some
shit it'll come up so
here's the deal what makes a set
effective for the next uh
next time when you start doing them what
has to come calm down between cents
first of all you have to make sure the
cardiovascular system isn't limiting
like if you're about to do another set
of squats for quads and you're still
like
then you're clearly going to stop the
next set now because your quads fail
because your lungs have run out of
fucking ability to expel carbon dioxide
and then you're just going to throw up
all over yourself for active weight it's
not going to be a good set
another consideration is what about
other muscles like if you're about to
squat but your lower back is still
killing you like from
lactic acid pump in the lower back
clearly you may not be able to push your
quads all the way to the maximum
abilities
another consideration is your uh nervous
system recovery
and the best way to estimate this is
like do you feel real strong again you
know like sort of like core feeling like
it's fucking get the shit
i fucking wheel myself over the weight
versus like right after you do a set of
hard dumbbell presses you look at the
dumbbells you're like how did i even
lift those to begin with like
they've defeated me after a few minutes
you're like nah i got the shit right and
there's an honesty there that has to be
broached but
you you know when you're on you know
when you're off you have to feel odd if
you feel still exhausted
you're not going to be able to have the
systemic drive to recruit all the muscle
fibers that you want
you'll nominally do sets and reps but
not uh you know those sets will be
pretty low quality because a lot of the
fastest switch motor units which will
cover the most or
which require the most neural oof to
actually activate you won't have that
neural load so you don't even
sort of turn them on to begin with and
lastly is the local muscle itself
recover for you to do at least
like at least five reps percent right
because those are sort of the more
effective reps of the
last five anyway and anything it's been
shown that
hard sets of five reps or less work
really well or sorry five reps or more
work really well
five reps are elastic it's just not
enough stimulus percent so
here's an example if you do calf raises
and
you finish and then 10 seconds later
there's no more lactic acid in your
calves you feel super fucking strong
again
you never got out of breath because it's
fucking calf raises and there literally
is no other synergist muscle
you're good to go every 10 seconds and
those sets will be equivalent to if you
rest much longer
and in some cases even better because
they summate more metabolites and they
give you a bigger pump
you guys might notice like if you rest
two minutes between calf raise sets like
not a lot happens you never
really get a pump you're like i don't
know what i'm doing here it's like
resting 10 minutes between each set of
rows like
are you warming up again or something uh
but if you if you condense it and then
you check all the factors then you're
good to go
for squatting checking all the factors
might take four or five minutes between
sets and if you condense it anymore
more sets doesn't need more growth it
means the same amount of growth has
fewer sets with longer rest times
the kind of hilarious answer to this is
like the best way to put it is
it's a good to rest as long as you need
and has no additional benefit in resting
more
but if you rest not as long as you need
there's a real big cost so rushing is a
stupid idea
but taking your sweet fucking time only
pays dividends until it checks the four
boxes
and after that it's by no means clear
pays any dividends at all very similar
hilariously
uh thing has been found with most test
takers in the iq literature
and in the um literature on just test
performance
is if you condense a test and they get a
time pressure test people start doing
worse
uh on average because it's just not
enough time to think shit through and if
you give a lot of tests a certain amount
of time
almost everyone they either get the
answers or they don't and just you never
ever see those people in class who stay
like to the very end of the class and
look looking at the same question like
motherfucker you're not going to
reinvent you're not getting science
equations in your own fucking head
answer say you just clearly did study or
you're just not smart enough to answer
this question
like it is you give it a good hard think
and then it's over right so same idea
with training get it in rest just enough
time get it done
and resting anymore really just profits
you nothing
yeah 100 agree and that's another
another way in which hypertrophy
training is very kind of flexible
where you know like other things like
strength training and kind of sport
specific training
or tend to be a little more rigid and
like just to contextualize this a little
bit let's say you were doing hypertrophy
training
for sport maybe you were trying to get
more muscular for powerlifting or for
football or something like that
that is the rare instance where you
might justify taking longer rest times
simply for just the pure every single
rep of every single set is as forceful
or and as powerful as you can make it
but again like
what's the impact of that on hypertrophy
probably not
a ton if any it's more of how much of
that is going to transfer into strength
and power performance later on are you
able to shift kind of the force velocity
curve over a little bit across like
sub-maximal loads and then hopefully
that translates into more maximal loads
but that's like the only time where it
really makes
any fucking difference the rest of the
time it's very forgiving and
just like we've talked about with like
exercise orders and prioritizations and
intensity loading zones like hypertrophy
is really forgiving in this regard you
just have to check a few simple boxes
and that's the stuff that mike
already mentioned so don't overthink
this resting this is what kind of
it drives me nuts a little bit sometimes
because people are like okay what's the
difference between
90 seconds and two minutes of rest it's
like what could
it doesn't matter all that matters is
how you feel about this exercise at this
very moment
it doesn't matter what the actual number
is you just go from there
can you really pour it on and get great
like forceful muscle contractions
is the muscle the limiting factor if
anything else is the manufacturer it's
not great if the muscle isn't any factor
really you're kind of there you know
like you're there
yeah so don't overthink the rest things
too much like i think it's one of those
like
more often than not you can kind of
intuit when you need to go
or uh and then setting like restrictive
rest times at that point just serve some
external purpose like for me i actually
do set restrictive rest time not
restricted but like i set like a hard
like three minutes or two minutes that's
just because i got shit to do and i
can't spend two hours in the gym and
that's a trade-off
could i be getting maybe better results
if i did something else sure but again
you make trade-offs based on your
lifestyle
as it's the teeniest tiniest differences
potentially none
teeny tiny i remember when i was in the
the wrestling
locker room when i was in ninth grade
and the word teeny tiny
phrase came up a lot whenever i took my
clothes off i don't know why maybe i was
a skinny kid
just it's just just just dude talk in
the locker room this guy's having fun
just uh just guys
messing around getting out of that
shower and whipping with the towel
you know what's funny is like a lot of
straight dudes on like social media
do that whole like bro talk with like
yeah fucking steak needs to be rare
brother
like i love my harley and fucking pepper
and salt on a steak and fucking yeah i
love sex you know like
just guys joking around calling each
other names and like
to the rest of us that are straight it's
all i just like oh right on you proved
yourself you were man
17 years ago and now you consistently
have to tell yourself that every day
slow clap
but dude if i was fucking gay and into
dudes dudes i would follow
every single one of those people can you
imagine like like you and i are the
girls can you imagine that girl being
like oh my god just doing girl stuff
haha like yeah hell yeah like what else
like show me your girl life
it's just funny like the guys who are
doing like the i'm a fucking straight
guy like
you are a gay man magnet the more that
shit you do
which is oh hey maybe it's a sequel it's
a secret strategy because maybe the
guy's secretly gay and they're like if i
come off super fucking straight and bro
like
in come the gay requests and i fulfill
man
it's so true the the like um the like
masculine virtue signaling stuff drives
me
nuts like we get it yours it's hot to
gay guys so
yeah i think i think i don't know i
think it's just like we're mad they're
even like rolling their eyes like jesus
we're like sensitive to it because we're
all we're both men so we see it we're
like dude get out of here but it is kind
of annoying when they're like
i like to blend up cigars in my
smoothies because i'm so fucking manly
[Laughter]
i've served in every war since vietnam
like i have 300 dogs and none of them
sit on the couch
but they all hate no no none of them
love me but they all respect and fear me
you're like dude your thoughts sound
like they suck
well it's like people who okay which is
like fun time with mike and james now
people who get dogs that are like
dangerous and required in order amount
of training to keep like from choking
children to death with their teeth
oh my god it's like yeah i've got a
fucking czechoslovakian shepherd
he's a fucking psycho i gotta make sure
he gets 900 worth of fucking
education a week from the police academy
otherwise they'll turn on me
i'd understand any of that that's a
feral dog yeah like
who's benefiting from this like are you
are you like showing off how much money
you have to piss away at dog training
yo not to talk shit but uh so crystal
and i have started to watch religiously
i would say the greatest show you've
ever recommended to me which is law man
by steven seagal
oh yes so good it's so good
they have steven vision where he like
zooms in on some guy carrying a gun and
you're like steven saw it and it's all
like
like high def color where all the other
stupid cops missed him
but he's exactly that person in this
respect where he has like he just bought
two dogs
and they hate each other because they're
both like super psycho shepherds of some
kind like they're designed to kill
people
and like he can't even train themselves
he has to outsource the training
and then the guy trains him how to train
his dogs so that they don't kill people
and they're like
he's like these dogs have one primary
purpose to protect my family like from
what
themselves if you can just get rid of
those dogs your family's gonna be way
safer
fuck my dogs have three skills looking
cute
doing death prone activities and shriek
shrieking out of anxiety
all they do is like like fall off a
cliff that's like
that's all they do they're cute and just
i mean
they are not winning any darwin awards
anytime soon let's just put that out
there yeah
crystal and i were hanging out with uh
uh joe sullivan and and brie terry who
just like he's super elite power left
jersey and vegas and good friends of
ours
and debris brought her bulldog bruno
who's a frenchie but he's the size of an
english for some reason oh
oh my god that's a huge friendship he's
huge and he literally came
he played with us for a sec and then he
went to the corner of the room
and just stared into the corner for no
reason for five minutes he turned away
from everyone
holy shit unbelievable this dog is just
useless in
every capacity and and then he actually
he can jack off so he's like rubbing his
own dick with his paw and then he
switches pause because he gets tired
it's tired incredible
too much lactate on this one gotta go
switch that's my that's my low bar for
what is a good dog like is the dog happy
like yeah i think so like great
good enough does he know tricks whatever
like what tricks is it
james your dogs must know some tricks by
now right yeah no they're
so the thing is like my dogs are they're
smart and they can they learn shit
really quick
they just are like really anxious so
like you could just be sitting there and
nothing's happening and they're like
[Laughter]
just like what what is happening they
just shriek and freak
out for no reason and that's what i want
a dog that has panic attacks do you feel
sane by comparison
yeah i mean they're sweet dogs and i
love them very much but yeah they're
like
like we can't take them anywhere because
their shriek is so deafening and like
physically hurt it causes me physical
pain when they do it
you know what i mean it's just that that
that frequent i'm like i'm gonna go deaf
when i'm 50 because of these fucking
dogs i swear to god at least they're
trying to kill your children
no they don't that's the thing they
don't have a mean bone in their body
like
they they panic because they like watch
to
like um endocytosis with you like they
want to become
fucking one with you because they love
you so much and if you don't let them
they shriek and panic
what would they do if you actually let
them run towards the deer on your
property
oh they've already done it they just
take off they so some moyas have one of
the worst
wanderlust scores meaning they will just
fucking go and leave like
so everybody in my neighborhood has all
these great dogs that are so well
trained they're off the leash and they
just come
like mine will come if i call them but
if there's like a fucking deer or
something in the yard
they will just they'll just run for like
three miles they're not hunting they're
trying to play with the deer
i think they're curious about it and
then they're chasing it and then they
they
they won't they don't want to kill it
but they are curious and then they'll
the deer will fucking outrun them like
it's nothing
and then they'll just be like sweet
let's go let's go adventure look
new things i haven't seen exactly it's
happened where they've like run
um like like a mile down the road i had
to get the side by side and like chase
them down

i'm that guy whenever we have to bring
our dog somewhere
