when you train hard and create micro
tears in your muscle fibers you've
created the primary stimulus for muscle
hypertrophy your body will repair the
micro tears and ultimately create a
bigger and stronger muscle
how many times do you think you've heard
this
chances are a lot these two videos with
a combined net 40 million views both
suggest micro tears are the primary
stimulus for muscle hypertrophy
if this is true
the implication is you'd want to
consistently train in a way that
produces high levels of muscle damage if
you don't you're leaving gains on the
table
however
what if we actually examine the
literature on the stimuli behind muscle
hypertrophy is damage the primary
stimulus for gains or is it something
else
well
let's go ahead and summarize the current
literature
[Music]
people have suggested micro tears drive
muscle hypertrophy based on a few
different arguments
when muscles get damaged immune cells
called neutrophils travel to the
location of damage primarily removing
cellular debris
but neutrophils also produce reactive
oxygen species and reactive oxygen
species have been theorized to promote
muscle hypertrophy potentially via
increasing activation of the mapk
signaling pathway a pathway that
ultimately increases protein synthesis
and thus muscle size
moreover another immune cell called
macrophages are also believed to produce
something called myokines
and myokines are small proteins that may
also promote muscle hypertrophy
aside from these immune cells
muscle damage can also cause the buildup
of fluid and proteins at the site of
damage resulting in cell swelling
this swelling puts pressure on various
things in the muscle fiber and it's
thought the cell sees this as a threat
to its integrity
subsequently resulting in protein
synthesis increases while protein
breakdown decreases
ultimately leading to an increase in
muscle size
the final main reason behind why people
have speculated damage stripes
hypertrophy relates to eccentric only
training
during your normal exercises notice how
you're challenged significantly more
during the lifting termed concentric
phase
versus the lowering terms eccentric
phase
eccentric only training is where
specialized machine or some equipment
overloads and challenges you during only
the eccentric phase
this type of training produces
substantially more damage than normal or
concentric only training
and eccentric training has been proposed
to produce more hypertrophy in the long
term
thus perhaps the greater damage with
eccentric only training causes the
greater long-term muscle hypertrophy
so
the immune cell response cell swelling
and eccentric only training are all
lines of evidence that suggest damage
may be important for muscle hypertrophy
but does this conclusively mean damage
drives hypertrophy no
[Music]
regarding the immune cell and cell
swelling arguments though suggesting a
potential avenue between damage and
hypertrophy it's just a mechanistic
discussion it isn't sufficient to prove
more damaging training produces more
long-term hypertrophy moreover although
we noted reactive oxygen species may
play a role in increasing mapk signaling
it is also believed to have anti-muscle
growth effects making its overall role
in muscle hypertrophy far from crystal
clear
with eccentric only training some may
suggest this is direct evidence more
damage leads to more hypertrophy
however this does not seem to be true
the idea eccentric only training
produces more hypertrophy comes from
older research conducted before 2010
since then more research has come out
and the whole body of evidence fails to
demonstrate eccentric only training is
superior
quoting a 2017 review study we conclude
that when matched for either maximum
load or work similar increases in muscle
size is found between eccentric and
concentric resisted training
interestingly eccentric only training
despite similar overall muscle size
increases may be able to produce a
different type of hypertrophy versus
concentric and normal training but will
save this fascinating finding for
another video
progressing on we have some solid data
that seriously questions the importance
of damage for hypertrophy
a 2011 study out of the usa by flynn and
colleagues assigned 14 untrained men
into a pre-trained or naive group
the naive group performed eccentric
exercise on a leg cycle ergometer for 20
minutes at a somewhat hard exertion
level measured using a subjective scale
three times a week for eight weeks
the pre-trained group did the same thing
but they had a three-week ramp-up phase
before the eight weeks where they
gradually acclimatized themselves to the
training program
due to this acclimatization phase
they ended up experiencing little
amounts of damage across the training
weeks whereas the naive group
experienced much higher damage levels
across the training weeks
yet hypertrophy of the quadriceps ended
up being comparable between both groups
now the naive group did on average c 1
greater gains but this might just be due
to random chance and not the actual
training regime as it was not
statistically significant
another 2016 study out of brazil by
damask and colleagues further indicates
damage isn't related to hypertrophy
they found after untrained individuals
performed a single training session
myofibular protein synthesis was of
course increased afterwards
however
this increase in my fibular protein
synthesis did not correlate with muscle
hypertrophy
rather it seems it was directed towards
repairing the damage induced by that
single training session
as these same subjects continued
training for some weeks which resulted
in them experiencing less and less
damage as your body produces adaptations
that make you resilient to muscle damage
it was only then the my fibula protein
synthesis increases after training
correlated with muscle hypertrophy
rephrasing all this
this data suggests after an initial
workout that produces much muscle damage
the myofibular protein synthesis
increase afterwards is mainly directed
towards repairing the damage
not increasing muscle size
but after a few weeks of consistent
training which allows the body to
produce adaptations that reduce the
damage experienced
then the myofibrillar protein synthesis
response is strongly directed towards
increasing muscle size
the indirect implication of this study
is excessive damage might actually be
counterproductive for hypertrophy
and indeed a 1999 study out of the usa
similarly indicates this
in fact this study suggests in certain
cases excessive muscle damage causes
muscle loss
they had six men perform five sets of
ten eccentric biceps curls with 110
percent of their concentric one rep max
signs of damage and swelling persisted
for seven days after the session
but after this subsided muscle volume
actually decreased by 10 to what it was
before the study and it remained at the
smaller size for numerous further weeks
this might be because excessive damage
can cause partial or total destruction
of subpopulations of muscle fibers
a few other lines of evidence similarly
imply excessive damage may cause muscle
loss
a final nail in the coffin for the idea
that damage is the primary driver of
hypertrophy is the existence of indirect
evidence finding regimes that produce
more damage do not produce more
hypertrophy
higher rep ranges likely cause more
muscle damage but we now know from
numerous studies higher and lower reps
can produce similar hypertrophy
short rest between sets one minute or
less tends to cause more muscle damage
than resting longer between sets
yet we know with compound exercises at
least resting 2.5 to 3 minutes between
sets produces more hypertrophy than
resting for one minute or less
finally bro split routines where you
cram all your volume for a muscle group
into a single session per week will
cause more muscle damage versus
spreading your volume for a muscle group
across more days per week as done with
full body workouts yet bro splits are
likely not superior for building muscle
[Music]
in summary muscle damage is clearly not
the primary stimulus for hypertrophy so
what is
mechanical tension is likely the primary
hypertrophy stimulus
muscle fibers contain mechanosensors
that can detect tension and then convert
this tension into a signaling event that
leads to myofibrillar protein synthesis
increases
thus
to optimize mechanical tension we'd want
to recruit as many muscle fibers as
possible and expose each fiber to a
decent amount of tension
achieving this is not complicated you'd
want to get to or close to failure with
your repetitions likely at least three
reps away from failure
this is because getting to or close to
failure ensures your effort is high and
the amount of effort you put forth has a
close relationship to the number of
muscle fibers recruited
additionally as you know failure many
muscle fibers will increase their
activation levels
notice how this indicates a wide range
of things can build muscle
so long as you get to or close to
failure a wide range of rep ranges and
rep tempos are going to be similarly
effective
