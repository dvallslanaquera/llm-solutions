and if you're operating under that sort
of misguided notion that it's all about
food selection and calories don't matter
as long as you just eat the right foods
and you follow the right type of diet
then it genuinely could have a negative
impact on your results
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to talk about a very
common misconception
when it comes to the subject of calories
and fat loss
there seems to be a pretty big sort of
backlash nowadays against the notion of
calories in
versus calories out there's a pretty
substantial anti-calorie crowd out there
who will say
that calories in versus calories out is
flawed or even that the whole model
is straight up irrelevant when you're
trying to lose fat
hey everybody now there is some truth to
the general argument that they usually
give to this
which i'll explain in a minute here but
it's still usually based on a
fundamental misunderstanding of what
calories actually are how calorie
deficits
work and what calories in versus
calories out actually

so nowadays there are a lot of people
out there who
just don't like the term calories in
general because they can kind of stir up
images of
obsessive eating behaviors and overly
restrictive dieting and things like that
but in reality calories are just a unit
of energy that's really all a calorie is
it's just a measurement
that describes how much energy there is
in the foods we eat and in the tissues
on
our body and a very common argument that
you'll hear
is that calories in versus calories out
is flawed
or even that it's totally irrelevant
because different foods are going to be
processed differently in the body and
because of that
you can't just look at the calories only
now there
is truth to that yes different foods do
have different effects in the body
500 calories from one food is not
necessarily the same thing
as 500 calories from a different food
and that's because
it's protein content it's fiber
micronutrient composition
where it falls on the satiation index
its calorie to volume ratio
all of those things will have an effect
on how that specific food
acts once it's actually in your body so
yeah the
food quality and macronutrient
composition of a given diet
does play a role in the fat burning
process and you can take five different
2000 calorie diets
and each one could produce differing
results to a certain degree
even though they all contain 2 000
calories however what most people don't
realize
um and this is kind of the main point
here which is somewhat theoretical but
i'll also give you some practical
guidelines after as well but the main
point is that the way
food quality and macronutrients impact
fat loss
is still ultimately a result of how they
affect the
calories in versus calories out equation
and if you don't like the word calories
for some reason then you can just use
the word energy instead just say energy
in versus energy out
when you consume different foods with
different nutritional profiles
your net fat storage and your net fat
loss is being affected
either because those foods cause you to
absorb a differing amount of
total energy or because they cause you
to expend a differing amount of total
energy
energy can't be created or destroyed it
can only change forms
and so when it all comes down to it it's
still a matter of calories in
versus calories out and i'll give you a
few examples of this
protein would be an obvious one protein
has the highest thermic effect of the
three macronutrients
meaning that your body burns more
calories in order to digest it
protein is about 20 to 30 percent tef
carbs are five to ten percent and fats
are
zero to three percent so if you go from
eating a low protein diet up to a higher
protein diet you're actually burning
more calories through digestion so it's
directly affecting
the calories out portion of the equation
um if you're training properly and
consistently
then protein is also going to help you
build muscle and since muscle is more
metabolically active than fat tissue
the more muscle you're carrying the more
calories you're also going to burn at
rest so it's still
calories in versus calories out in that
the protein is literally helping you
burn more calories
satiation is another factor certain
foods are higher on what's called
the satiation index which means that
you'll naturally feel fuller after
eating them so if you eat
higher satiation foods you'll likely end
up consuming fewer total calories
overall
probably without even realizing it
assuming you're not tracking your
calories in detail and so that's
affecting the calories
in the calorie density of foods is a
factor too if you eat foods
that contain fewer calories relative to
their volume so that's generally going
to be
minimally processed whole foods you know
leaner protein sources low-fat dairy
vegetables fruits things like that
the higher food volume will physically
fill your stomach up more and so you'll
end up eating less
and taking in fewer calories overall and
this is where some people get confused
because they'll say you know i didn't
track calories i just focused on eating
clean
and i ended up losing fat therefore
calories don't matter and it's all about
food quality but what they don't realize
is that
those higher quality foods are usually
just lower in calories in general and
they're more filling as well
and so the reason why those foods make
fat loss easier is precisely because
they cause you to take in fewer calories
by default
we could also look at micronutrients so
again if you're focusing on minimally
processed
nutrient-dense whole foods that's going
to make sure that all of your vitamin
and mineral needs are being met which is
going to help you maintain an optimal
hormonal environment in your body
it's going to keep your energy and your
strength
levels higher and those things will
affect total calories out
fiber is a factor too when you consume
higher amounts of fiber you
actually absorb fewer calories overall
so again that's affecting calories in
on top of all of those things there's
also the question of specific dietary
approaches for example
we could look at intermittent fasting or
even ketogenic diets both of those diets
once you are
adapted to them they can have uh
significant
appetite suppressing effects now the
research is uh pretty clear so
far that neither one has an inherent fat
burning
advantage but if your hunger is
suppressed as a result of fasting for a
portion of the day
or as a result of following a ketogenic
diet you're naturally going to eat less
and that is going to again affect the
calories
in portion of the equation there's
nothing magical about these diets
they're just methods that can make
maintaining a net calorie deficit easier
and so again this is where people get
mixed up they don't understand
what calories actually are which is just
a measurement of energy and they don't
realize
that the way food selection actually
impacts fat loss
is because of how it affects the total
energy going in versus
the total energy going out so if someone
tries to tell you
that calories don't matter or that
calories in versus calories out is a
myth
uh or that a calorie is not a calorie
you pretty much know right there that
they ultimately
don't truly understand what they're
talking about a calorie deficit is a
mandatory requirement for losing fat
you have to expend more energy than you
take in that's what stimulates your body
to tap into its excess fat stores for
energy and all calories technically are
the same
because a calorie is a fixed unit of
measurement however
not all foods are the same and it is
true that by optimizing your food
selection
and finding the daily eating pattern
that works best for you
in terms of controlling hunger and
maximizing energy and training
performance
that will help to tilt the calorie
balance equation more in your favor but
the overall calorie balance
still rules everything when it all boils
down to it so
the people who preach this sort of
anti-calorie idea
they are correct in the sense that a
food's caloric value on paper
before it goes into your mouth that does
not tell the whole story
since different foods require differing
amounts of energy
to digest they have different fiber and
micronutrient profiles and they affect
hunger levels differently as well
however they are wrong to then take that
and then claim that that means that
calories don't matter or that calories
in versus calories out
is an incorrect model since again it
still boils down to the net energy going
in
versus the net energy going out and in
order to lose fat you still need to
create a calorie deficit
by expending more calories than you take
in
so part of this whole calories in versus
calories out thing
is partly an issue of semantics and it
is partly a genuine misunderstanding of
calories in general
and if you're operating under that sort
of misguided notion that it's all about
food selection and calories don't matter
as long as you just eat the right foods
and you follow the right type of diet
then it genuinely could have a negative
impact on your results
because the key thing to remember is
that food quality
that can only take you so far it only
impacts the energy balance equation to a
limited degree
and it has pretty sharp diminishing
returns as well sure if you're going
from
a really crappy highly processed low
protein
calorie dense diet and then you switch
over to a more unprocessed
higher protein nutrient dense diet yes
that will definitely make a measurable
difference
all on its own and you'll probably start
losing fat without even needing to worry
about tracking calories at all
that doesn't mean that the calories
don't matter it just means that by
default you're going to end up in a
deficit because you'll be eating fewer
calories than you were before
since you'll be fuller and more
satisfied and because your food choices
have essentially been cleaned up a bit
meaning again higher thermic effect more
fiber higher micronutrients
increased energy to work out etc however
once your diet is already decently
optimized in terms of food quality and
especially as you get leaner and leaner
then you are going to need to pay more
attention and you're probably going to
need to start tracking things
in more detail if you want to continue
losing more fat because fat loss does
get harder the leaner
you get once your fat loss stalls which
it inevitably will assuming you're
trying to get reasonably lean
what are you going to do at that point
you know you can't just keep eating
cleaner and cleaner and cleaner
once your diet has all the basics in
place
meaning enough protein so 0.8 to 1 gram
of protein
per pound of body weight daily or higher
if you prefer but that's a good minimum
range
you're focusing on less calorie dense
higher satiation foods you're getting
enough fiber
you're drinking enough water sleeping
properly and you're following a good
well-structured training plan at that
point it really does just come down to
managing
calories in versus calories out on paper
and if you try to dismiss this entirely
and just stick with the idea that
it's all about food selection you could
end up plateaued for a very long period
of time
when all you needed to do was just lower
your calories slightly
and lastly keep in mind as well that
even if calories in versus calories out
is not a perfect model on paper which it
isn't
it doesn't have to be perfect that's the
other thing that people get wrong
they'll say
oh you know you can't perfectly track
your calories in versus calories out
because of all of these different
factors
and therefore the whole model is
completely worthless no
even if it's not perfect it's still
close enough to produce the practical
outcome that you're after it doesn't
need to be perfect it's just a way to
generally gauge what your maintenance
calories are and to gauge that you are
in fact in a calorie deficit
which usually is going to fall somewhere
around let's say 500 calories
below maintenance per day if tracking
calories didn't work and it was just
this chaotic
uh hit or miss approach then
bodybuilders and physique competitors
would all just follow an intuitive
eating approach and they wouldn't be
getting absolutely shredded
by tracking their calories and macros in
detail i don't recommend following those
types of extreme diets
we're getting that lean either but i'm
just using that as an example to
demonstrate the point
so bottom line guys both your calorie
intake on paper and your food selection
play a role in the fat burning process
and they both play a role in
how effectively you're going to be able
to adhere to your diet long term
and food quality definitely matters in
terms of overall health
gym performance muscle growth etc and
you should pay attention to both
factors but if your central goal is to
lose body fat
it ultimately does boil down to
maintaining a calorie deficit by
expending
more energy than you take in that
calorie deficit
is going to be partially impacted by
your food selection and your
macronutrient ratio
but this is only true up to a limited
point and once you have
a primarily whole food nutrient dense
protein sufficient diet in place with
your meals laid out in a way that you
enjoy
most and that you can stick to then
calories in versus calories out is still
the ultimate bottom line no matter what
and that's where your focus needs to be
if you want to continue leaning down
long term if you found this advice
helpful and you want to learn precisely
how to tie this all together as far as
an actual step-by-step
eating plan is concerned so the proper
amount of calories that you need the
macronutrients
recommended food choices and other
