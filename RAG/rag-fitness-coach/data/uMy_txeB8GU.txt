hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization before we get into the
meat and potatoes of this video
i'd like to give you a special gift a
suggestion that becomes a gift
steven seagal you know him as a martial
artist
actual a very good police officer and of
course
a movie star super actor but did you
know that steven seagal
is a prolific musician instead if you
youtube steven seagal music
some of it will come up on youtube and
don't play it around children because
actually quite perverse no joke so
yeah sure watch our video like subscribe
whatever other youtube stuff i have to
say
go watch steven seagal's music videos
and please
comment about what your favorite lyric
was and or your favorite one of his
songs
uh in the comments below but we're
getting ahead of ourselves go enjoy
doing that come back here
for muscle gain dieting made simple
video number six
creating a surplus so so far and all the
videos before this
we've sorted out food portions food
types and meals we're good to go with
that
we're counting macros and we have a
stable meal plan big deal
we know pretty much how much we're
eating which is any time you want to
make changes to that like if you don't
know where you are
you have no idea where you're going and
of course per the last video we know how
much
fluid to take in and what supplements to
take and probably what supplements are
not worth our time
now for some people this entire process
of adjusting and configuring can take
months and there's not a damn thing
wrong with that getting used to this
kind of approach is important
because just starting to do these things
already makes you more muscular
and if you're going to be really
muscular later getting a good hang on
this process is
really really critically important right
if you're training hard this entire time
as you're slowly
counting more of your macros and eating
more protein and spreading onto multiple
meals so on and so forth
you'll just be gaining muscle this
entire time in most cases especially if
you're more of a beginner
and because this is a made simple video
maybe you are more of a beginner but if
you're not there's still pretty
good stuff to learn now for a lot of
folks
probably for the majority will take a
while for some folks especially more
experienced people
this will only take a few weeks and
after a few weeks they'll really have
this really good plan
and it's going to be a maintenance plan
right essentially they've sort of
figured out how many calories to eat and
figure out what foods and all the meals
etc and
after a few weeks they'll be like okay
like i really want to turn this
into not just a good eating plan to
support good training
but a purposeful muscle gain plan and
especially folks have had dieting
experience from before
like if you come to these videos and you
know what macros are you've used
myfitnesspal
gee you know you're overqualified within
a week or two you might be like okay
i've got it what are we doing so on that
note here's what we're doing
now we're ready to purposefully gain
muscle well in other words
alter our diet in such a way that muscle
gain is
the real big central point of what's
going on
the most powerful weapons you have for
muscle growth
are in most cases hard progressive
weight training that gets harder over
time
and a caloric increase okay
because we want to get bigger we need
the calories to do so
okay if you are eating the calories to
maintain a body weight of 170 pounds
there is no way on god's green earth
you're going to get to 190 pounds at
some point
without eating more food it's just
impossible unless you somehow magically
reduce your physical activity a ton
then you get fat and unhealthy you just
got to eat more it's absolutely the best
way
into certain body weights the only way
okay there's
dexter jackson's a perfect example he
started his bodybuilding competitive
career
in the mid 130s so he weighed like 132
or 135 on stage when he first started
i mean he was already eating well and
training and you could say like hey like
just gain your way to to mass bro and
just eat whatever and
you'll be fine don't try to eat food on
purpose he would have finished his
career maybe just by natural
increases in appetite that a company
weighed training maybe at 160 or 170
he finished his career at like 245 on
stage okay
i promise you dexter jackson had to go
through many many episodes of eating
on purpose more than he wanted right how
much more though
you're sure you can eat all the cookies
in the world and then just gain so fast
that you get fat
definitely a bad idea so our best
recommendation and again we can get into
super detail in other videos about why
and all the nuances but in this made
simple video
between 0.25 and 0.5
of your body weight per week is a really
good goal
it offers you enough oomph to really get
you to gain some muscle but not so much
oomph that you get super super fat
and this is probably best done over the
course of about eight to 16 weeks at a
stretch
okay anything less than eight weeks is
like oh gee you know there's a lot of
momentum that develops you probably
at week eight are really starting to
really put on muscle your training is
going well your diet's locked in and
it's kind of stupid to stop
and much after 16 weeks you're probably
pretty fat you maybe need a mini cut or
you're so tired from training so fatigue
you need a maintenance phase lower
volume so on and so forth h is 16 weeks
of course there are exceptions but in
general not a bad place to start
so 0.25 to 0.5 body weight per week so
you know basically if you weigh 200
pounds
that means you gain between half a pound
a week to a pound a week
right nothing crazy but something pretty
notable right
now how do you gain this on pure simple
math
which has tons of nuances tons of
caveats we
want to gain half a pound a week we
increase whatever we're eating at
maintenance
by about 250 calories per day okay every
day for a week and then after that week
mathematically you should have the
average super shotgun target
of half a pound per week if you want to
gain a pound it's 500 calories up
from your baseline diet so you basically
have two choices and sort of anything in
between
so if you want to gain a pound per week
then you need to take your calories and
add 500 to them
right now there is some math involved
because you may not
actually weigh 200 pounds squarely
making all this math super easy or 100
pounds
what if you weigh like 150 or something
in between
well you just need a couple things and
i've demonstrated all the formulas here
for you
you need your current body weight you
need your weight gain uh per week goal
in percent
you just multiply the first by the
second and then you multiply that result
by 500 calories to get how many calories
of surplus you need
in order to actually gain roughly your
first best guess
at the weight that you want to gain so
here's a very easy example
you currently weigh 150 pounds you
weight gain per week goal let's say 0.5
a week you want to be nice and
aggressive
you multiply 150 by 0.005 which is 0.5
and you get point seven five pounds per
week okay that's what you have to be
gaining in order to get your goal
and that point seven five pounds so 0.75
times 500
is 375 daily calories is what you need
to
add to your plan so if you're currently
eating 3000 you need
3 375 in order to have a best guess
of gaining 0.75 pounds per week which is
for your body weight
in this example 0.5 percent and you can
pause the slide
look through it try your own numbers
it's like kind of like you're back in
math class and
10th grade it's like a worksheet plug it
in and then see what you get and if it
looks like
it says i need to eat 3 600 calories you
did it wrong
it'll go only 36 calories you also did
wrong okay but if it's something in the
several hundred calorie mark you're
probably on the right track
now creating a surplus is cool
but as many people will point out to you
calorie is just actually a measurement
of energy specifically it's a
measurement of heat
so how the hell do you add heat to your
diet i mean i guess you could make
things really spicy
i'm not gonna follow you thought i was
gonna take that joke further i'm not i'm
just gonna dump that
that's a garbage joke turn up the heat
in your house i'm done i swear to god
i'm done stand closer to the
pan when you're finding your food in the
kitchen i swear to god that was the last
heat joke
i'll ever make put on sweatshirts but
that's all i'm gonna say
in any case you can't actually eat
calories okay calories are just a
measurement of something
so what do you actually eat well we have
choices protein carbs fats
what do you do how do you add those
calories well generally speaking
you want to add in as much of that as
possible as you can in carbs
because carbs promote really big pumps
which probably make you more jacked and
they're cool to have
they promote a ton of energy to power
really awesome workouts and they
probably have a small
but significant uh direct anabolic and
anti-catabolic effect
so if you eat a high carb diet it
prevents muscle loss at times of the day
or night when you may not have enough
protein to support that
uh or you're really stressed or so on
and so forth and it also probably causes
a little bit muscle gain over time
nothing wrong with fats though so if
you're really tired of eating a whole
lot of carbs because like look
if you bump up your carbs a ton of time
a ton and your fats are the same
the meals start to look weird like it
used to be having like you put a bunch
of rice in a bowl and a
little bit of parmesan cheese or
something a little bit olive oil that
was really really awesome to eat with
chicken it tastes great
but now like you doubled your carbs so
that meal tastes a lot drier and you're
like oh this is really hard to eat
you double them again and you're like i
can't eat this there's way too many
carbs not enough fats the food's all dry
it's crap
i can't go out to eat anymore because no
restaurant has foods that are so high in
carbs so low in fat
so until it becomes inconvenient i would
say push the carbs a little more but
there's nothing wrong with fats
and up until they get at least 2.5 gram
per pound
so if you weigh 200 pounds up until
you're eating 100 grams of fats per day
or more
it's totally fine to add fats and
there's really just almost no downside
right add carbs first then add fats
or add both until you hit that whatever
surplus of let's say in this example
375.
why not add protein at a technical level
could you add protein yes
protein is calories it would totally
work the thing is protein is more
expensive
in almost every case protein is not as
delicious as added carbs or fats
okay when you're dieting for a contest
or something or you're super
hypercaloric you're like man you know
what i could do
just crush more chicken breasts bro if i
could have more casein pudding
that'd be amazing like what the fuck
says that you probably want more carbs
and more fats and probably in
combination with
all the best foods are really high carb
high fat foods some of them have protein
like you know cheeseburgers and some
really don't like donuts
okay so they might as well be more tasty
they might as well be more cheap
and protein is relatively filling
especially sort of clean protein
that has low fat so it's tough to add
protein in the real world and also
pointless
and also here's a really big kicker if
you're already taking in like a gram per
pound of protein like we talked about in
the earlier videos
adding more protein doesn't directly
cause any more anabolism
yeah the calories you add will but
adding protein from
a gram per pound to higher to that 375
extra calories
versus adding that in fats or carbs or a
combination gives you
roughly the same anabolism probably a
little bit better with a higher carb
lower fat
but it offers you no special advantage
above and beyond the calories
so literally if you already have your
protein in and you're making food and
you have like mac and cheese with like
chicken or something
and you're like oh i need more calories
you add in like a quarter of a stick of
butter somebody could be like why don't
you just add in more chicken and you'd
be like that would be
in no way beneficial and in every way
problematic for my games okay unless you
really feel like you need more chicken
and then look i'm not gonna stop you
restart to install the latest windows
update you guys know what's funny i
don't even have wi-fi right now
windows easy bill gates don't activate
my moderna virus chip i don't want to
die i love my family
all right so now now that bill gates is
single
who knows what he's capable of and oh my
god
fuck scotty hamstring cramp
bill got me you guys
please leave this in do not build
bill listen i came at you all wrong fuck
you guys i still have a hamstring crap
oh my god i did high i did my reps of
leg curls earlier today
fuck holy fuck
you guys i fixed the cramp just waited
it out and had some fluids
mr gates i'll be continuing now
check this out i'm using microsoft
powerpoint
yay isn't that nice
all right on a serious note though my
hamstring cramp is 100 legit and super
serious
if you can't consistently get this
increased surplus of food from healthy
foods
it's absolutely okay to
get your bump your weekly average
by having a bit of junk right always
with protein in the meal so if you have
ice cream i would recommend having a
protein shake with it
but a little bit of junk is totally fine
as needed
what is a little bit up to 25 of your
diet can be junk it'd be totally fine
just don't be like half or 75 or
something like that right
it's that easy this whole process is not
that hard now
that's just starting the surplus and
remember
that calculation you made is just your
first guess
at what that actually is however
your body may adapt to that surplus
after a week or two
and or you actually guessed wrong to
begin with because all this is
based on a very rough guess you could
have increased activity by accident or
decreased it
or you know thermogenic effect of food
went up because your you know
your metabolism is adapting so on and so
forth so
you might not gain at all you might lose
weight even after the surplus or you
might
start to gain at a good clip or gain a
little bit
uh more slowly after a while if that's
the case
if you go about two weeks without
gaining as much weight as you planned
per week then what you can do is create
an additional 250 calorie surplus
i could get more mathematical and have
some other kind of fraction or
multiplier to your body weight
if you throw in another 250 it usually
is enough
to really be a good start to a solution
and if next week you still are behind
throw in another 250. some folks have to
do a couple of cycles of this
to really start gaining at the rate they
want and then six to eight weeks later
it still starts to bottom out and you
have to add more food it's just
a part of the process your body adapts
you're also getting physically bigger
you're going to have to do that a few
times no big deal and you do it using
the last
three-step method sort of from the last
slide so when you ask okay 250 calories
and what the answer is again
a combination of carbs and fats bias
towards carbs but to your liking
that's it it's as simple as it is so
next time what are we going to cover
we've given you the formula
unless to gain weight for 8 to 16 weeks
at a consistent
pretty impressive pace shameless plug if
you use the
rp diet app it actually does all these
calculations for you
it automatically adjusts if you're not
gaining fast enough it adjusts actually
every week not just every two
it's off uh really super awesome if you
want to offload the work
no big deal if not there's tons of other
ways and you can do this yourself you
can use myfitnesspal no big deal
now it's easy to plan like this
but sometimes difficulties during the
muscle gain phase arise and we could
even say like
a lot of times expect difficulties and
a lot of people start muscle gain diets
many fewer people finish them
so next time our video is going to cover
some very common difficulties people
experience in muscle gain dieting and
we're going to teach you
ahead of time how to either avoid them
or fix them when they arise
so your probability of actually
finishing your muscle gain diet you've
designed here with these videos
is as high as it can possibly be folks
see you next time for the love of god
by microsoft products because they'll
come get you
