oh my goodness good to be back dr james
dr mike
dr mike's just waiting to grill me with
something i can tell he's got something
up his sleeve
he's gonna put me to shame here is
a riddle what
is weekly but only occurs
once every other week this is the
rp weekly weekly
yes we suck somebody made a comment
on uh one of the things that was like
love the content but this bi-weekly shit
is
bullshit or something like that
james i love your haircut thanks i got
like the mad scientist covino hair going
again it's just all over the fucking
place
i would say you look sexy i think
furthermore i would say that you're the
kind of man that i would meet in a bar
and think geez this guy is trouble
but i want trouble looking for trouble
tonight baby let's get it
let's get into trouble we've gone to
clubs like that before
many many many many i always tried to
flirt with the gay men and the gay clubs
but they always know i'm straight
they have no they see right through us
they see right through us
get out of here oh i've been called
straight meat so many times
you hetero cis male
normative guy yeah
some of those are redundant
[Laughter]
all right shall we shall we shall we yes
let's answer some questions let's do it
first up is henrik anderson by the way
the algorithm did a dog shit job
of uh of organizing these like so
there's going to be some skipped ones
because like
there's a bunch of like ones with 18 up
votes that are like five pages down and
it's like
what's going on here i don't know that's
crazy all right
all right henrik anderson asks how would
you go about massing slash cutting when
calorie expenditure is vastly different
every day
gaining slash cutting usually results in
me gaining body weight too quickly
flash fast by quite a lot i've been
tracking calories for some time now and
i can't seem
to estimate my energy accurately enough
going by weekly averages don't really
help me either as my body weight has to
shift by quite a lot day to day
so the weekly averages should help you
if your body
shifts day to day because it probably
doesn't shift much week to
week so that is something i'd
probably focus on a little bit but
anyway continuing on
do you have any tips or things i should
consider doing
so that can reach my aperture equals as
efficiently as possible thanks a lot
advanced stocks so
i mean just weekly averages and average
weekly macros
i can't really recommend anything better
than that because you say that you're
gaining and cutting usually results of
me gaining body weight too quickly
or i guess losing body weight too
quickly then
now that you know that whatever like uh
surplus you want to impose or deficit
you want to impose just cut that shit
buy a third or cut it in half go from
there and then remember like a lot of
these things
especially with mass gaining happen in a
very long term
and it's okay to be like even in a mild
deficit a few weeks
because you you do have some preparatory
hypertrophy and all this other stuff and
recapping is going on early in the meso
so it's okay to sort of start
on the easy side and then catch your
drift or you can start on the hard side
like let's say you
gain body weight too quickly when you're
massing start at your normal surplus
and then when you've gained like three
pounds in two weeks which is too much
in in your case you could reduce the
surplus by a little bit and then you
sort of know that you're in a good place
so i think the vastly different everyday
calorie expenditures i have a pretty
different
daily calorie expenditure it doesn't
bother me much because i just know that
day to day my body weights are going to
be all kinds of weird shit let me put
this in perspective
i currently weigh roughly on average 241
pounds per
week and i have some days where i wake
up and i'm 247
and some days i'm 237 and other days i'm
236.4 and shit like that
so i mean 23.4 you wake up you're like
okay clearly not in deficit
wake up at 247 and i'm like okay i'm
clearly like the fattest man in the
world
but a lot of that's just water weight
stuff and you know if i eat a lot uh one
day and i have a lot of like junk food
on my cheat day or whatever i have like
like friday and saturday night i
have some cheap foods yeah wake up
heavier it's no big deal but
the weekly average really to solve those
problems for me james
yeah actually kind of it was a nice
segue because what i was going to
recommend heinrich this you might be
factoring in
um sort of like the initial water weight
changes a little too heavily into your
equations so what i might do is um
as you are transitioning from cut to
mass or vice versa
you might actually just kind of do like
a very
what you would normally do and just kind
of let it cruise for one to two weeks
and just let your body weight adjust
because you might just be like a big
water shift person where you
put on a lot of water weight and take a
lot off when you make those transitions
so
maybe give yourself like a one to two
week kind of buffer period
and then start more rigorously looking
at those weekly averages and see if that
helps because
what i'm guessing is you might just be
dumping and taking on a lot of water and
that's causing your
weekly numbers to look like they're
skyrocketing a lot when really you're
just kind of
refilling or draining a little bit as a
result of your dietary changes so
maybe give yourself like a buffer period
for water weight adjustments to
normalize and then see if that helps
that
that is another alternative beautiful
real quick um
hanohido asks
hey docs um i've recently started
noticing some spots on my head where the
hair seems to have thinned out
i've been considering taking finasteride
but what's holding me back is that i
don't want to negatively affect my
natural bodybuilding pursuits
since it messes with the body's dht
levels do you guys know slash have an
opinion on how it might affect
bodybuilding james might i don't
but i will say that you need to find
broderick chavez
chavez's team evil gsp um instagram
page and especially his facebook group
and his
pay site uh where all these questions
will get answered for you because
all this hormone stuff is 100 percent up
his alley but james
unless you have something there to offer
i don't know anything specifically about
finasteride i do
i use rogaine which is a different i
forgot what the chemical name is i
forgot off the top of my head they
actually sell it you can get like the
costco version too which is what i do um
and that
it for me has had no no tangible effect
on anything except help me
keep my hair which is great uh but no no
personal experience or knowledge on
finasteride specifically
yeah the broader chavez team evil gsp
that's the stuff where to find all that
and if you join their facebook group um
a lot of the guys there are so
knowledgeable that you don't even need
broderick to
to weigh in they'll just answer your
questions for free so
yeah solid okey dokey
next up is killer content that's a
little
arrogant right i believe has zero posts
on his youtube which is just funny
even more arrogant yeah got it
all right killer content has a very good
question cutting question would it
conserve my muscle if i stayed near
minimum effective volume and two reps in
reserve every step from the mount cycle
is there benefit from going from media
to mrv
and for rar to zero ir instead so
um i'll i'll say this
so there's an obvious benefit which
we've beaten to
death right over and over it's nice
but i will say this um it's not so
if you could somehow stay at mev
which actually is possible um
and stay at 2ri r much less possible
against that a bit
could you do a fine job yes would you be
missing out on the easy gains and easy
muscle loss low fatigue stuff of being
as low as 4r yes
you would miss out on that so definitely
something to be said there now here's
the problem if you say okay okay
how did you go from four to two sure
but then how do you know you're really a
two r
and how do you know when you're
overreached
you know do you tell yourself okay it's
time to deload when i'm
my match progression system i i i hit a
slightly higher weight or slightly
more reps but i'm 1r now like what how
sure are you is at 1r
how sure are you about that you can't be
sure about it don't worry you don't have
to answer the question the answer is no
we'll answer for you
one of the absolute best reasons
probably the most important reason
that james and i advocate to pretty much
every meso getting to something like
zero ir
is to know that you have given it your
all and to have a
very hard-line quantitative um indicator
that okay your progression is over and
you are officially overreached
because a lot of times things can get
real hard especially on a deficit
you can feel super fucked up and you can
think there's that was one rar
and then you get under your head and all
of a sudden you do five more reps and
you're like oh fuck
i wasn't at two r this entire time so
yeah start at four because those are
super easy gains and super easy muscle
maintenance um
and then progress and progress and
progress slowly
until you hit zero rar or failure
and can no longer progress for sure and
then you know you're giving it your all
and you know you're in the right
overload range because especially on a
cut
general systemic fatigue and just
perception of effort can make it seem
like you're getting weaker or getting
overreached when in fact you're actually
not
so that's a thing um james
yeah and so there there are major
training benefits and potentially diet
benefits from going from me
to mrv and one thing just to consider is
like the goal of
your i think this question ultimately
comes from like a position of like
can i like i feel like i'm being very
diminutive and strong manny but it
sounds very much like
can i just do really easy training
during my cut and that's probably not
going to be
the best it's not going to serve that
mindset's not going to serve you the
best
and i think that there are lots of you
know longitudinal benefits
of doing hard training even under
calorie deficit conditions that will
manifest later on
so i do think that like the the notion
of like okay i'm gonna cut i should try
and just take uh
some really easy trainings probably not
gonna serve you if you have like
long-term training goals anyway because
you basically if you if you're this far
you basically signed up for this shit
for
the rest of your life more or less so
you might as well just get good at it
and the way that you get good at it is
by
going going for it relatively hard and
the other thing is like if you are a
beginner to intermediate which you know
like i would say
90 of people are um you're probably
still going to be getting some kind of
recomposition or some kind of
longitudinal hypertrophy down the road
that might be manifesting later from the
heart training
although the heart training sucks during
your cut it still is serving a greater
purpose down the road that you might not
be aware of in the moment so i do think
it's a good idea do that
yeah next up
alex cahill got it
docs you're legendary love you
motherfuckers
quick question i'm turning 40 and came
to lifting from the bike
although i still commute to work on my
bike my 15 years of super committed
recreational 5 to 6
000 miles per year wow cycling are
behind me and i'm all in on hypertrophy
with thanks to rp absolutely great
results however well thank you so much
uh however once a year i still do a
bicycle camping tour with two buddies
200 or 300 miles over five days
non-negotiable has to happen
because i am sexually involved with my
friends just can't
say that last far we can all read
between the lines nothing wrong with
that by the way
in the weeks james and i have been on a
few camping trips if you know what i
mean
um in the weeks leading up to and
following this year's trip in june
uh and also inside the ride what are the
best practices for minimizing muscle
loss
i eat a ton on the ride and slam plenty
of protein powder but curious if you
have other suggestions
thanks um my best suggestion is probably
a little bit outside of what you may
have thought
i would say but it is schedule
your ride during the first part of your
active rest phase
and just uh i can do it normally and
you'll lose a little bit of muscle
and it'll resensitize you like crazy to
get it back and you'll get all of it
back and then some
psychologically it'll take you away from
uh you know any kind of like monotony
because now you're riding the bike
instead of lifting weights
it's nice it's highly active you can eat
whatever you want i would just say
it's so easy to regain lost muscle if
it's just from several days
trip um i would just say it's not a big
deal at all and just you know eat plenty
of protein don't stuff yourself
um with protein like crazy and don't do
anything insane in training take it at
the beginning of an active rest phase i
think you're fucking golden james
no that was the exact same route i was
gonna go it's so five days
even though it's going to be like a
highly active and potentially catabolic
period it's really just not enough
time to really to make substantial
losses in muscle mass so
as long as you're relatively body weight
stable during that time and like the
week after
i mean i know you're probably going to
drop some water weight and maybe not eat
as best as you could but as long as
you're relatively body weight stable
i really can't imagine you having any
major long-term impacts and like dr mike
already said
you're going to re-sensitize and gain
any lost muscle right back right away
and then you've had an awesome uh active
rest phase where you kind of broke up
the monotony of your normal training
stuff you did something wacky and
hot damn when you come back it's going
to be easy games for a little bit and
you're going to look great so
i would just just not even fuss like dr
mike said don't even fuss with it just
do the trip
enjoy it and the only thing i would say
is like just don't lose a bunch of body
weight and so like
dr mike said like eating plenty of
protein is good but like maybe
don't think i have to over compensate
with protein because your calories are
going to be
your energy expenditure is going to be
so high from doing all that writing you
might just wanted to slam
as much calories as you can and maybe
protein might um you know to a certain
point might just be two setting and you
might be like oh i can't eat any more
and now my body weight's going down so
find a good balance there you know so
obviously
plenty of protein but you also might
rely more on some like liquids goose and
just high calorie stuff at that point
and that's fine as long as your body
weight's not tanking i think you're good
to go
yeah yeah yeah
all right next up is our old friend from
the rp plus days
bastian imani oh it's been a while
it has so he says
greetings docs long time no see it's me
baseem but i have changed my name to
bastian since last dude that's fucking
sweet who the fuck changes your name
that's awesome yeah right on
james if you had to change your name to
something what would it be well i kind
of already did so i used to go by uh
jim or jimmy back in the day well that's
what my family called me because that's
my dad's name and uh
when i got to like the age when i
started working you know you know and
all of my documents say james and
everyone would be like james or jimmy
and i was finally just like just call me
james at this point just
you know because like you go to college
or you go to you work and people want to
know what your name is
it's just easier that was just like just
call me james i don't know
yeah so that that was mine that was mine
there you go or jimbo
jim jimbo over here what do i call you
gmo
jmo that's a good one your australian
nickname oh
so he says uh hope you guys have been
having nice lives so far mine's great
i'm
i'm studying to be a dietitian now and
i'm hoping for an academic career in the
far future that's really awesome
that's really really good to hear either
way on to my question about the rap
slash weight beating or matching
progression system
maybe it's less of a question of more of
me just wanting to juggle some thoughts
with you guys as the saying goes over
here in sweden
yeah so juggling thoughts is pretty cool
and european
but anyway it's no big deal because this
is sweden and nothing's a big deal
still haven't been to sweden been to
scandinavian countries many times but
not sweden
i heard in sweden if they if you look
like you're on steroids they just pull
you aside and like potentially jail you
for suspected steroid use so they can
drug test you
so whoa really is not going to sweden
anytime soon you feel me is that
actually a thing
i believe so i've had people from sweden
tell me that that actually happens
whoa trippy scary uh i like that sweden
has their priorities in order
um yeah like look at this guy
just lifting up to no good um
all right let's see now let's say that i
trained six total sets of quads on
wednesday
of week one i do three sets of leg press
150k
for 15 12 8 followed by three sets of
100 kilogram squats for
10 7 6 all three are i didn't get as
sore as i expected so i increased week
two's wednesday's quad volume
to eight divided equally into leg press
and squats
plan is to decrease my rer to two by
increasing the load of my leg press to
155
the matching week one's reps however the
problem in my head appears when i think
of the squat
would a more appropriate rar
decrease be executed by maintaining
weight and reps for the squat
since one extra set and weight in the
leg press has made me way more disrupted
and pumped than last time
so at a relative and absolute level my
squats are already harder than
the last time by the mechanism being
more disrupted from the leg press
the last week without a necessary rer
decrease
by rep or load therefore while matching
both weight and rupture from last week's
squats
in this context lead to a two rir or
would you still recommend an increase
just in case my counter argument is that
uh would be that generally my fitness
levels still increase
enough to warrant extra loading or extra
reps in the squats
irrespective of how harder it is to
squat after week two's leg press
compared to week one so
great question and i have actually a
very easy straightforward answer you
just gotta try and see
and what you do is you get through the
first four leg press sets
as you intimated 155 kilos great great
idea
you hit roughly one rir and everything
and you're like oh that's really great
that's what i wanted
and then the when the squats come up you
warm up
and you see how you feel if you feel
like fucking golden you're like oh fuck
it let's just increase the load on the
squats too because clearly my fitness
adaptations are pretty fast
if your warm-ups go man you're like holy
fuck my quads are fucked up
then go on the easy and safe side in
your first set just make it 100 kilos
for a set of 10 like it was last week
and now once you hit 10 reps
here's what you can do you can sort of
momentarily like for a split second stop
and be like am i at 1r
and you should know yes or i'm really at
zero or man i'm like three or four or i
might get two and if you're a two ir
just two uh
11 just add a rep this is where rep
edition
is such an awesome tool it is an awesome
tool in any other context but like
you already have 100 loaded it's on your
back and you're doing the set
you're gonna auto regulate inside the
set itself because
load regulation just uh regulates
between sets
rapid regulation you can do on the spot
you like stop for a sec lockout you're
like
i can do a couple more this is no big
deal then you go to 11 instead of 10
and then boom and then the next set you
treat as an independent set yes 7 is
roughly your target
but you can go a little higher a little
lower and see how that compares so
and if you think okay wow like 100k was
way too easy
is the right answer to do 105k on the
next two sets
or three sets sure that's totally an
answer you could do one of five for two
sets and you're like oh this is catching
up to me you can go back down to a
hundred
so there's tons and tons of ways uh
different ways to skim this cat two
things one
um at the end of the day you just have
to try
and adjust on the fly to get the closest
you can rer
match or beat as best as you can and
remember it's match or beat so matching
is totally fine
totally fine especially if duh you have
tons of leg presses before of course
you're gonna be more tired
if you match with more leg presses
before you in the squat you're not not
really matching
and you're beating in some sense of like
underlying physiology is is more
adept uh and and two remember when you
skin a cat either way it's
absolutely the worst possible thing for
the cat because you know jesus christ is
getting skinned wow
it's time uh yeah really good answer i
will i would add too that um
the reason why the you know match or
beat system works really well is because
it assumes that the whatever
progressions that you're taking whether
it's reps
load rar or some some combination of all
of those things
are i don't want to say relatively small
but within kind of the ballpark of what
you should be doing
where you're going to find problems in
the subsequent exercise kind of in this
case like okay well if i
pump up my leg press is that really
going to take my squats out of
this or that that's probably an
indicator that your jump was really
large
and maybe you're on track now in terms
of the rep ranges rars and stuff that
you were shooting for but you were
probably
under doing it before which then has
kind of like dissimilar conditions
across
sessions right so the reason why match
or beat works is because the fatigue
conditions
regardless should be pretty similar so
if you do find that you can increase
your
uh let's say you you go up by 10 kilos
in your leg press well that's probably a
good indicator that you've gained some
fitness
and correspondingly you probably gain
fitness on the subsequent exercise as
well
so it should be roughly the same now if
you take like a
50 kilogram jump on your leg press right
and you're like hey
that was too ir great well yeah now your
next exercise is going to be fucked
because it's so
different so match your beat works when
the conditions are pretty much the same
and your progressions are like
you know maybe you increased your reps
by one to two maybe you increased the
load by two and a half to five kilograms
and you went from you know r3 to r2
those those types of progressions if
it's more than that
then you might find that yes in the
subsequent exercises
you might have to reevaluate some of
those things and auto regulate a little
bit
and you can really just keep the if you
do four back exercises in one session
which streams i probably say is too many
but
it can be done your fourth back exercise
may actually have the same load and reps
every single fucking time the entire
meso
but because you increase sets and
decrease rr so much for the first three
exercises
that relatively becomes much more of a
challenge
totally fine to do yep
all right oh sorry and run real quick
theoretically because i think you guys
would be interested in this
uh we hear a common retort of like yeah
but what if you get so tired from your
first few exercises or sets
that you have to like reduce the load
and stuff on the last ones
how does that do the master up that's
one of the reasons that why we train
multiple sessions per week
um and and try not to do any more than
like 10 or 12 cents per session per
muscle group because you're getting so
fucking tired that you're getting weaker
towards the end of your exercises you
have to ask
yourself not just a question of is this
a tracking problem it totally is
the biggest question is this is an
overload problem and it absolutely is
like if you're weaker than ever
because you're so fucking tired why are
you still in the gym what is that you
think you're doing that's literally junk
volume at that point
yeah so you have like the junk volume in
terms of like the within the same
session but you also might be having
like an sfr
issue too where you might say like okay
well this exercise is good deadlift is
the classic example we were like okay
i'm gonna do deadlift and then you can't
do anything else the rest of the session
right like okay well
could i have actually just done three
different exercises and gotten way more
out of it or can i just do deadlifts and
then a bunch of junk volume afterwards
like classic
example all right next up is j
r letter j letter r split
goddess what are your thoughts on a
strength specific lower body
slash hypertrophy specific upper body
routine i have zero desire to grow my
legs
just want to get stronger on squats and
deads and have zero desire to get much
stronger my upper body lifts only one
size
i can say it's pretty good manly
priorities right um
also i would just enjoy training much
more this way any tips on programming
this
man not really you know if you do do
your intelligent programming
um and i would probably include like
deadlifts if you do them i would include
them as lower body at that point
um then you know you could just treat
them as really quite independent
and you just do strength program for
your lower body hypertrophy program for
your upper body and
there's you know there's some systemic
disruption interference but not much
and generally speaking you what you i
would say the number one thing you want
to keep in mind
is um putting your leg stuff
by first and also keeping um
a lot of uh spinal erector work uh in
your upper body like lots of
rolling and stuff from being like the
session before you go do heavy legs
because then your axial abilities your
ability to stay upright
uh and and have a flat back are really
deteriorated
uh so you don't want to do like tons of
event rows monday then go to your
strength
leg workout tuesday if anything you'd
want it the other way around
or take a break and do monday wednesday
or something like that if you're gonna
be doing back
maybe monday you do heavy legs tuesday
you have a push which doesn't really
interfere with
anything and then wednesday you do your
hypertrophy
or sorry hypertrophy push and then once
you do your hypertrophy back work that
way doesn't really interfere with a
whole bunch of stuff
so maybe think of something like that
that's the only real tip i have other
than that
it's totally totally good to go yeah and
like the only the only thing where it
gets
slightly more complicated is if you're
to have to make a decision whether you
basically just want to train your legs
at
mv and do you know relatively
hypertrophy style lifting like five to
ten reps or something like that
or if you actually want to be hitting
like an mev mav4
strength on the legs which is a slightly
more complicated issue because then you
actually have to factor in like
progressions and intensity and things
like that
which is then going to have more
compromise and spill over onto your
upper body lifting as well
so it's just something to think about
it's not a right or wrong thing you
could easily just train your legs
roughly at
mv and you'll have like a really high
state of preparedness and you can make
some very marginal gains and strength
over time which
sounds kind of like what you're you'd be
happy with or if you want to actually
make like tangible gains and strength in
the legs
you might be actually looking at more
like mev levels for strength and then
the
progressions that follow accordingly so
just think about that and think of
the trade-offs that you want to make in
terms of upper body growth and lower
body strength development yeah
all right next up ghostbusters sign
lucas johnson ghostbusters oh
he does have the ghostbusters sign
figured i'd say that's much easier
what are your thoughts on micro loading
for instance add 1.25 pound plates to my
bench on each side every time
i increase weight instead of 2.5 on each
side and i find it helps me maximize
progress
without shocking my body so much that
i'm still sore from my next workout
lucas i think that is a phenomenal idea
the only downside of it is if you train
at a commercial gym you might have to
carry the magnet plates in your bag and
that's kind of fucking annoying you
might forget one at some point then it
got stolen or some shit
but other than that man micro loading is
fucking awesome
if you want some really good articles on
it uh google micro loading metal
hanselmans he has all sorts of really
great recommendations on how to do
things
it's fucking sweet it's not magic and a
lot of times it's just
the realistic amount of load you could
put on the bar so people that are more
advanced
or if you have dumbbells for example
like motherfucking you know
other than adding reps you're not going
from the 15s to the 20s in one fucking
microcycle
you might go from the 15s to the 16.25
to the
17.5s and so on and so forth and that's
actually very rational progression so
it's totally totally fine
and people say like you fucking bust
like just go up another plate
those people are mindless animals yeah
and i actually think the
calling it micro loading it makes it
sound diminutive that's just loading
that's just like a more optimal way of
loading right like
and uh weightlifting is a really great
example of this because they use they
call it
change plates right but they got the
little teeny little you
if you've never been into a
weightlifting gym they have these like
little teeny tiny little plates and put
it on there but
who gives a fuck right the whole point
is to train at the lows that you're
capable of of achieving
of chiefing overload at whatever you're
training right so it's like if you need
one if you just need another one pound
like add one pound
that's fine i don't see why that's even
a question like it's not
not insulting the question er but like
it's not uh it's not a weird thing it's
like if you just need to go up by one
pound go by one pound or two pounds or
whatever i think it's great
yeah you know you call it micro loading
so then people were like oh micro penis
right come on that's lame
you're like what that's good yeah no i
think it's totally fine
yeah there's a lot of weird shit that
people shy away from because it's like
not manly or whatever
i actually know people that um
really only deal in 45s and occasionally
25s
you know like they'll do bench and
they'll just do like if they're feeling
not so good they'll do 350. if they're
feeling great they'll do 365.
if they're feeling dumb they'll do 405.
and it's like you know like don't pat
yourself on the back too hard for being
a fucking moron
yeah i actually have a couple clients
who had like a home gym set up that was
literally like they had like a bar and
like
a forty two forty fives and i was like
oh uh
well we'll we'll figure it out we'll do
something here i don't know something
we're gonna do a lot of repetitions
yeah all right a little bit more of a
controversial question from
our friend fake natty whoever it isn't
actually drug free
weird there's some funny ass names
fabulous toaster
fabulous okay
fake natty got it what are your thoughts
on front squats for hypertrophy i don't
see them performed or even mentioned
much by the rp crew
is it purely a preference thing or do
you actually consider them inferior
for this purpose to other squatting
variations as a side note dr feigenbaum
in one of his recent articles argued
that whether one does high bar lobo or
front squat is almost irrelevant
outside of sports specific context i
suspect he draws a bit too bold of
conclusions from the studies he cites
here
but my lack of knowledge uh unables me
to challenge them in a meaningful way
link to the article below
so i mean so that that last note i mean
that is just completely answered by sfr
at that point right you can just
you can just use that to answer should i
do these exercise variations for
whatever goal sfr boom done like
yeah pretty easy let's expand on that
we'll answer that second question
first and then the first question second
so uh
uh dr feigeman argued that whether one
does high bar low bar fun squats it's
almost irrelevant outside of sports
specific context well
just kidding hypertrophy is a sports
specific context
uh this also upsets me but i'm going to
try to be a little bit more polite than
james is uh losing his mind over there
james i feel you 100 percent i actually
think sport
sport specific is less relevant in those
because you could just say like that's
true
as long as you're doing like a triple
extension or a hip extension knee
extension like
you could that i think it's less
relevant
in that case sure so i think maybe steel
man
jordan's position there dr feigenbaums i
think he's saying like if you do weight
lifting you do high bar
front squat and if you do power lifting
you should do low bar which is
absolutely correct
that is definitely true the thing is in
the sport of bodybuilding
well we care about the hypertrophy sfr a
whole lot and what you have to do is
find which one of those has the highest
sfr which one has
the sfr that is so low that is not even
a candidate for your selection of
exercises
and there could be a lot of right and
wrong answers specifically
um a huge vast number of people
that try to low bar for reps find that
it fatigues the fuck out of their
posterior chain especially their back
it bothers the shit out of their
shoulders or elbows or wrists or hips
you just kind of pick one and the
stimulus to the quads is good
but remember stimulus two fatigue ratio
the fatigue is fucking massive and the
stimulus is like man
it's fine so a lot of times people who
have low bar squatter for a lot
a bit trippy when they switch to high
bar they're like oh my fucking god
nothing hurts anymore and my quads are
getting at least as good of a workout
so that's a huge win that's why
squatting low bar for most people
for hypertrophy pursuits is just not a
good idea because of that so far like
james said
secondly front squats actually we can
answer both these questions at the same
time
the problem with front squats is twofold
in bodybuilding
one is they tend to be a relatively
unstable movement
in the sense that you can't produce very
high repetitive forces because the bar
moves around a lot
and it actually starts to slip off your
shoulders so problem one it's not the
best way to apply high degree of tension
weight lifters do back squats to
strengthen their legs they do front
squats in order to get better at the
front squatting position which is a part
of the sport so even weight lifters
don't use front squats to get legs
stronger or bigger they use high bar
squats for that
otherwise the fuck would they have high
bars fall for so
second problem uh this is not one that
uh involves
um weightlifting because weightlifting
the guys don't ever squat for
you know front squats they don't ever
really do for any more than five reps
which is exactly what
you would never need to um
in bodybuilding hypertrophy work you
will do sets of at least five to ten
often 10 to 15 in the squat
the front squat will choke you to death
if you try to do that it does it
actually in two ways one
if you have a really good rack position
and you're staying upright
it physically chokes you by fucking
pushing into your goddamn airway
second if you don't have a good rack
position and you let your shoulders go
down
it's just to crush your rib cage and you
can't
take in as much air as you want because
you're fucking going like this the whole
time
it's dog shit and a lot of people who
have really pushed themselves in
training
in the quad movements find that they
could just do so much more with the high
bar squad and deliver so much more
stimulus to the quads with so
few other limiting factors than front
squats which is why for
most people not all front squats are
just not that great of a choice which is
takes us back to the idea that all those
three high bar squats for almost
everyone in hypertrophy are just
dominant
yeah very good answer so i think there
are some people that that are just built
in
such a way that front squats is good is
great for them and that's fine
what i have found and this is just my
own anecdote so take it or leave it but
i i think that uh front squats tend to
be great for beginners and intermediates
to some point
but usually once you get strong enough
uh
to the point where you start running
into these problems right that that then
it just becomes less and
less excuse me the sfr goes down over
time so
kind of the the tldr version is like it
works great
until you get strong and then once
you're strong you're like fuck this i
can't like
i just can't train this way anymore same
problem with like deadlifts and stuff
um so i used to do a lot of front squats
myself
until i would find that like doing sets
of like 275
for eight or you know 300 ish would just
be soul crushing
right and i would believe me just i
remember a couple times at temple i did
a front squat workout for my peak week
and i remember i got through my heavy
sets and i was
just instantly overreached and i was
trying to tough guy my way out of it and
i was just like uh nope i'm gonna do my
down sets i had four more down sets to
do and
it was just one of those comical moments
where i went for the down sets and i was
like
i'm literally overreached everywhere
there's nothing i can i can't even do
like a lateral raise at this point i'm
done like for the week i had to i had to
auto-regulate a d-load like so front
squats just one of those that like
uh to a point it's useful and then it i
kind of think around that intermediate
stage the sfr just really starts to tank
absolutely all right
next up is tuomas who has a seagull
as his avatar
let's see oh got it
all right he says hi docs what is your
stance on doing exercises that are
heavily spinal
loading such as squats during the
morning workout i've read about the fact
that after
waking you have more spinal fluid in
your discs that might cause problems
if load were to be added on top of that
should this be taken into consideration
when planning
workouts this is a funny question yeah
james why don't you why don't you start
on this one
um so i you know i don't really have a
ton to comment on that
specifically i think it's more of a
practical issue it's just of like when
are you going to work out when does it
fit your schedule
that's just where you go from that point
on you know there is like
it is documented that people do grow and
shrink a little bit throughout the day
and after you sleep you kind of elongate
out like to a very small
marginal extent like if you've ever and
this you can do this little experiment
for yourself in the car
look at where your rear view mirror
starts and then take you know
at the end of the day or the next day
look at it again and it's usually off a
little bit why because you literally
just moved around just a little bit
so there is some truth to that should
that influence your decision to
do heavy spinal loading no i think if
you're going to work out you're going to
choose to do that or not and when you do
it is dependent on your schedule and you
just go from there i don't think you
have to give this any specific
consideration
yeah sometimes if you wake up in the
morning some people kind of have like a
loose
si joint thing going on lower back feels
kind of loose and it feels weird to load
it
uh warming up really just does away with
most of it but sometimes you might
actually feel a little bit better
training later
other people when they train later their
lower back already has a little bit of
fatigue and kind of
wear and tear from the day and then just
nearly just fatigue and
and then later in the day they don't
feel so good in their lumbar region
and they prefer actually to train early
in the morning i will say that like one
thing i wouldn't do
is go heavy on the axial loading
movements after getting out of a long
car ride or plane ride because sometimes
your back is in an interesting position
mildly inflamed in those relevant areas
and then you majorly inflame them after
with training and then everything goes
to hell
so that's something to keep in mind but
most of the stuff is really obviated
quite well by
um by warming up man i've made that
mistake before
i fucking took myself out of training
heavy for months by fucking
getting out of a nine hour car ride and
then doing heavy squats and i was like i
was convinced
i had herniated disc i didn't but that
shit was irritated as
fuck it was bad and then sometimes you
just feel weak as fuck too you're just
like what is happening today
why do i suck so bad that's just
how it goes good advice
next up is andrew atkinson
man that thing is all over the place
today huh got it crazy
andrew says hi docs how often should one
switch up their split
in other words the order of exercises on
a day or they order
each day goes in the week or the weekly
layout i know it's a good idea to change
exercise variation every few months
whereas they get stale but what about
weekly split also considering things
like frequency etc
how long would you say is enough time to
give things um to assess how well it's
going
thanks as always for the great contact
from your very
english friend last time i made jokes at
his expense for
how english andrew atkinson really was
it is oh man there was a fighter uh this
weekend
davey davey something he had like one of
the most gnarly accents i've ever heard
uh i can't remember his name man but he
got on the mic and you were just like
what what speak english but nobody
understands what you're saying
yeah oh man all right
so really good question here andrew a
couple of things
first to quote
you know the saiyan saga in dragon ball
z
you know the ascension occurs from a
need not a desire
and in that sense you know you have to
have a good reason to change your split
which can include you just bored and
want to change things up
just don't expect any magical results
from that as long as the split you
change to is also
effective foundationally like you're not
doing anything crazy wrong
then you're good to go but really you
have to have a good reason here's an
example of a reason
you were prioritizing your back for a
while and usually train chest and back
on the same days let's say monday and
thursday
so you were doing uh back first and now
after a few months your back growth is
really good
you want to prioritize your chest you
start doing chest first
like that's an example of alternating it
but for a reason
because you want to prioritize your
chest and not your back and also you
could just get really
um like stale of with that kind of split
and maybe you want to change things up
so that's the first thing and then
second it says how long is enough time
to give
things uh a go to assess how well it's
going uh considering things like
frequency etc
i would say you should have an average
frequency that's roughly the same for a
few measures in a row a block is a
really good way to evaluate it
so you do a block of 2x a week a block
of 3x a week
a block of 4x a week see how those go
when you find okay
4x a week is not sustainable for a block
2x a week is great but i can push it a
bit harder 3x seems really awesome
then you may actually end up with your
next block being meso 1 is 2x a week
meso2 is 3x week measure 4 is 4x a week
maybe or not
or you say 4x is just too much anyway so
i go two
three three and then i do my active
raster do my maintenance or something
and then you figure that out but i would
say multiple mesos struck together a
block
really gives you insight on what you
think is working and how well it's
working
yeah really good insight there um i
would say in terms of like weekly
uh layout uh aside from trial and error
like you should you should definitely
play around with things and see what
works well as dr mike was just saying
um but once you find one that works well
for you like for me uh example i do like
the six day split where it's like push
legs pull push legs pull
that works for me and i just always do
that now it'll get a little bit of
variation if i
if i you know uh periodize my frequency
a little bit
but the nuts and bolts are basically the
same or it's like okay i'm gonna do
chest
three days a week mostly in this pattern
with the exception of maybe
one meso i might have a fourth chest day
or something like that i do legs twice a
week maybe a third time per week
you know so it's kind of one of those
things where it's like once you find
what works for you
keep doing it until it stops working for
you because at some point your training
age might dictate that you do make some
changes and you might find that like
okay this is uh
was working really good for me and now i
can't train my legs three times a week
anymore i might have to cut it back down
to two because i've gotten really strong
great there's
as mike said there's the need to
reevaluate your training split
um but if it's working for you like like
i said i've been running the six days
split
years at this point and it gets changed
from time to time because they go on
vacation or
travel for work or take some active rest
or do some frequency periodization but
the gist of it is mostly the same so
there's no no huge incentive to uh if
this is the same goes if it ain't broke
don't fix it
100 yeah all right
last for today we had 11 questions
because the one on uh
finasteride and hair growth james and i
didn't know so we don't count that
yeah or el releasancy
we're mobby
holy shmozao yeah
question here is how much time does it
take to see gains
if you're doing things right a month
preparatory gains with a z
maybe two if you don't see gains in that
time it's time to fix something
what would be the things you would look
for first so we actually have a section
in our hypertrophy book which is highly
recommended of like
things you can do to track your gains
because
seeing gains is sometimes really hard um
it can take like a year for you to see
physical changes in your body
if you're not so used to looking at your
body or if you're pretty advanced
but there are really good proxies one is
and this is the easiest one
rep strength improvement on the
exercises you're doing look if you're
slapping on
an extra 25 pounds a month to your leg
press for three months
motherfucker you're making some gains
it's just not coming out of nowhere
right another one is do you have a gold
body weight and are you
on your way to reaching it if you
weighed 150 pounds to start
six months later you want to weigh 160
or 165
if you're four months in and you weigh
like 157 158 hey you're doing real great
if you're four months in you still weigh
150 and you're no stronger
and you look the same in the mirror gee
you know you got a problem so to answer
your question of how much time does it
take to see gains
depends on the magnitude of the gains
but really within one mesocycle
you should look back on that mezzo and
be like dude that was really productive
at least you should be able to say i got
stronger for reps and then if you can
say that
and you maybe gained a pound or two hey
you're well on your way uh or if you
recompt a little bit you kind of look a
little tighter
but you're stronger for reps that's
really the kicker
so a mess a cycle a mesocycle uh you
know
two one to two months however long your
meso takes you
um especially like after the deload you
should be like notably stronger perhaps
on the same exercises you're like oh
well i couldn't do this last month
then you know you're onto something if
that's not the case
yeah then it's time to fix something
james
yeah really good and i think this kind
of gives credence as to why we put so
much emphasis on performance because
performance tends to
factor in all these different things and
gives you like a very good middle ground
of what's going on
so on the one hand like how long does it
take to see gains well
you might see gains like the next day if
you're relatively untrained because
you're building
neural efficiency you're building work
capacity you're gaining strength
right you're not even really touching
any muscle mass yet but you're still
making performance gains which at the
very least is setting you up for gains
later on right so
maybe you're a slow gainer maybe you're
more of a slow twitch person you're not
going to put on gobs of muscle mass
there's all sorts of different factors
that go into it so you kind of have to
keep in mind like gaining muscle
even under the best case scenarios is
going to take a while it's
for at least for you to notice that
you've gained muscle
whereas performance is something that is
a good indicator of like
underlying changes that are indicative
of things like muscle gain or at the
very least
if you're getting stronger your training
is at least going pretty well so that's
like a good
kind of middle ground where if you if
you've noticed that your performance is
increasing
you're not fucking up right you're not
doing anything very bad
that's kind of like the the good news
there in terms of like how long does it
take to see gains like
you you all have those friends who they
they basically
coach tim coach fucking tim yeah he was
just like
he'll just do like two snatches and eat
a pizza and he looks like four for no
fucking reason
right whereas like your boy over here
spends years and years and years with
gumby man syndrome
and i still don't have arms that are
impressive right it sucks right it's
just
yeah so everybody's a little bit
different um so keep that in mind but
that's why we tend to lean on
performance because if you're getting
stronger
at the very least you're making
neurological changes that could be
potentiating muscle gains but very least
you're making work capacity related
changes
on the muscle that could be leading to
performance gains and in the best case
scenario you're actually getting muscle
so
boom yeah and then
after a few months
especially if you're a beginner your
body should look a little different
now now here's the thing that involves
psychology
rep strength tracking does not body
weight does not
like either 160 or 165 okay you either
got some strength or you didn't
some people look at their body and
they're like i don't feel like i'm
changing and everyone around them is
like dude
you're a fucking animal you've it's
night and day like i don't know i don't
know
and some people are like dude i think
they're like fucking better and you're
like dude you look the fucking same you
might look worse
so the the mirror of course is a good
tool
but complementary to the other things
especially
rep strength changes yeah yeah so like
having some combination of like
objective measures in this case
performance and subjective measures like
how you look in the mirror
it's probably a good place to start boom
that's it sorry i had to move around so
much i uh you're not you're in like a
very seductive pose right now you're
like an evening with dr
mike hello welcome oh mommy
you got like a bottle of wine we just
need like a fire like a flickering fire
light in the background
i could light my bed on fire is that the
same
please don't do that no no please don't
do that it's funny because i
actually this is a rental so that would
be really doubly bad because like sorry
landlord i
kind of lit the room on fire it was for
seduction
and i'm leaving now so don't worry about
that deposit it's fine i know you're
going to keep it i'd like my deposit
back
um anyway that's all i have james
um okay let's see so quick update for me
i uh we're working on
the hypertrophy book audio book uh
acx of course is very cunty with their
feedback so
so scott sent me the files they were of
course specked
to their guidelines and we tried
uploading them today and it was like
not specced to guidelines and scott and
i were both just like
are you fucking kidding me what do we
have to do to get these files uploaded
up
so i'm working on it hopefully that will
be done either today or tomorrow and
then it goes to review
and then next on deck will be dr davis's
book uh open space habit building and
cool same process on that is dr davis
the one that read that
i i read the the text and then mel did
the um
she did like there's a bunch of
worksheets in there about like how to
kind of like plan some of the
habits and goals and and behavior
changes and there's little worksheets so
she did the worksheet walk through and
then we also did like a little q a for
about 45 minutes at the end super yeah
so that one's gonna be fun and
interesting for you guys uh let's see i
think that's about it for me
and i got nothing as usual i'm always
putting out more youtube shit i'm always
working on a bunch of secret projects
um we can't talk about them because the
doctor jen case from rp would kill me if
i did
she's that's actually her job she's good
at killing yeah
um that's it folks
all right folks make sure you guys
subscribe to the rp youtube there's all
sorts of nonsense coming every week
uh and yeah just stay tuned we've got
all sorts of fun content coming out so
you know now that i'm seeing like
because you uh canceled out the
the screenshot and now i'm seeing my own
body like more zoomed in
this is like how like live bear fan
pages
that's what i was thinking too hair the
text this is terrible
this is dr israel's only fans stay stay
tuned we'll
link and link in the bio for only fans
mostly fans
james real talk do you think it would
degrade my professional image
and bring disrepute to rp if i actually
started a
almost exclusively gay centered only
fans
i don't have any problem with it i don't
know if you've saw you've seen lately
but there's been a couple like high
profile case not high profile but
there's been like there was a police
officer
and i think there was like a nurse or
something and they had an only fans and
they found out
what's wrong with that uh do they get
canned or no
i i don't remember what the outcome was
but i think they were considering
canning or there was at least like
quite a bit of repercussions you know
who hasn't only fans
gabby garcia oh
come on so yeah fun fact
everyone's going to be going on reddit
like who's got the gabby leaks let me
see
you know uh james we're not going to
we're going to go offline now to talk
more smack a positive smack
about our proclivities for seeing
interesting physiques naked
uh and and with that we leave you until
the next
bi-weekly webinar that doesn't occur
weekly but is the weekly webinar
that's it see ya
