what we want for most of these Hollywood
and Entertainer folks is to have an
awesome healthy body that looks great
and uh is healthy and strong jumping
around is pretty high fatigue high
impact and it doesn't contribute a ton
to muscle growth because it actually
misses out essentially in the entire
Ecentric phase so box jumps they're fun
they're cool to do with clients I would
say they're very very low on the
effectiveness range so most of the time
we should not be using box jumps in
training folks who are almost
exclusively interested in appearance
