degree of elbow then this is a tip
that's one of those you can try a few
things and see which one works for you
but if you don't know to try them you
might be stuck in a pattern that's not
super great one way to do the elbow
position is to completely lock it out
it's pretty easy to do standardized lock
up with your elbows and do the lateral
raise with elbows completely locked for
some people that makes all the
difference they feel their side delts a
ton for some folks it hurts the elbow it
feels kind of weird so for some folks
they want to keep their elbow just
slightly out of lock locked slightly out
of lock like this and sometimes it can
feel a lot better so play with both and
see which one is best for you
