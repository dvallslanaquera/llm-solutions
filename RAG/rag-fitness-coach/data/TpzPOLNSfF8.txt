all right what's going on guys so in
this video i'm going to be maxing out on
the squat bench press and dead lift now
just to get you guys all up to speed
here
last time i did this i ended up hitting
four plates on the squat so 405 pounds
for six reps
and i was actually really happy with
this now i should clarify that last time
i did an am wrap test
so i just put a fixed weight on the bar
and did that for as many reps as
possible
whereas this time i am going to be doing
a true one rep max test which is more
reliable
so anyway on the bench press i ended up
doing 315 pounds for eight reps
which i was also really happy with and
i'll just play that really quickly for
you guys here in fast motion
and then when it came to the deadlift i
ended up doing 455
pounds for four reps which was the lift
that i think i was most disappointed in
especially at the time so i'm hoping
that i'm going to be able to improve on
that this time around
so i'm hoping that i'm going to be able
to improve on that
so i'm hoping that i'm going to be able
to improve on that she's getting great
games anyway not having to try that hard
you don't achieve greatness from casual
effort
on the grounds of uh you think you're
five six
six inches shorter than me jeff you
gotta work on your legs more you need a
bit of an upper body bro
what oh gotta preserve energy for these
big lifts
jeff should train harder he literally
did a video on it so i'm like boom i'm
watching that video
gotta find the perfect song bro gotta
find the perfect song
protein better safe than sorry
rpe 8.2 people like trainer to failure
because it makes them feel hard
on the way to the gym as a little snack
i love you bro jeff you don't train like
a pig
babe i just had the weirdest dream
wake up jeff it's time to get yoked
[Music]
so get it all right
okay so that was my first max bench
attempt with 370. now for some context i
just finished up the final week of my
new
10-week power building program so it
ends with a max test week
and i'm running the final deload week
here now as i record this and i'm
excited to say that it's finally
available for pre-order on
jeffnipper.com
i know many of you guys know i've been
working on this over the last six months
or so
and i honestly think it's my best work
yet it comes with way more than just a
pdf you also get a custom excel
spreadsheet for tracking your progress
a technique handbook explaining how to
break through sticking points and video
demos from me for every exercise in the
program
and it's going to be 30 off for the two
weeks of pre-order and if you pre-order
you'll get sent a get ready guide
outlining ways that you should prepare
for the program so if you should deload
or test maxes before starting
and then as soon as it launches you'll
get the full power building system
and everything that comes with it so if
you're an intermediate to advanced level
trainee looking to take your size and
strength gains up to the next level
you can sign up for the pre-order at the
first link in the description box down
below
okay so i thought 370 moved pretty well
here but there are two things i'm going
to try to improve on moving forward
the first is keeping my butt down a bit
better it does look like it shoots up a
bit here which wouldn't be legal if i
were to
actually do a power lifting meet um so
i'm going to try to keep my feet a
little bit further forward to prevent
that next time
and i'm also going to work on tightening
up the paws on my chest i would like to
pause
just a bit longer and i'd also like to
sink the bar into my chest a bit less
so when i run back through the program
again i'm going to work on those two
things
but overall for a gym lift i'm really
happy with this and i do think this is
the strongest that my bench has ever
been
so after hitting that 370 i was feeling
great and i felt like i still had a bit
more in the tank and i did want this to
be a true max test
so i decided to bump it up another 15
pounds and go for 3.85
the reason being i wasn't wearing elbow
sleeves for that first max attempt and i
think the sleeves give me at least 5 or
10 pounds
so i figured a 15 pound jump was
actually pretty reasonable but as you
can see
that didn't end up going too well i'm
not sure if i just misgrooved the rep
because the sleeves threw me off
but either way i obviously didn't have
385 in the tank that day
i'm surprised i didn't get it i honestly
like
i think maybe throwing on the sleeves
threw me off because the technique
is like slightly different i guess i'm
somewhere in between
370 and 385. at least i went for it so i
know where i'm at
so people can't say i didn't really
matter
i feel okay though i'm surprised i i i
gotta watch that footage back
i thought i was gonna thought i was
gonna kill it so oh well
room for improvement and i'll just say
that if you are going to go for a bench
pr that you're not 100 sure you can
definitely hit
then i think you should set it up in a
squat rack or somewhere where you can
use safety pins
just in case you end up having to dump
the weight like i did but overall i'd
say i'm super happy with where my bench
is at right now and i do think it'll
continue to go up as i enter a little
bulk here to finish out 2020
so let's take a quick look at how
deadlifts went the next day
[Applause]
let's go
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh steph you're gonna love this
i don't know it's not completely torn
just partially
throughout the like program i ripped
three of these like completely down
to nothing and they finally grew back
and then i just ripped one of them again
anyway i'm happy with this i'm actually
going to leave it here i know
i've got a bit more in the tank but not
much more i could probably do more with
straps because i
start to notice like it might the speed
might look good but when i start to get
that shaking i know i'm getting
real close to my true max without straps
so i'm gonna leave it there for this one
leave a little bit in the tank but i'm
really happy with what is this 520
that's really good i haven't done that
in like five or six years so
really really happy with that not from
the floor anyway let's go get some food
so i ended up stopping at 520 pounds for
the deadlift even though i do think i
could have busted out another 10
maybe 20 pounds if i really wanted to go
all out
and even though some of you guys might
think that looked too easy for me
i'm actually really stoked about this
because this is the most weight that
i've ever deadlifted in an actual
competition
so my previous competition pr was 517
pounds
so i'm above that now with 520 and if
you guys remember from
years back the old channel intro that i
used to have on this channel
was me trying to deadlift 539 pounds
and as you guys know i ended up failing
that at the time but i do think i'm back
in that
all-time pr zone right now so couldn't
be happier about that
and also my back is feeling great at
this point so i think that it's just
smarter for me to leave a bit more in
the tank here
especially since i don't need to know
exactly what my true ceiling is on any
of these lifts to be able to
consistently make progress again
now something i've been really working
on with the deadlift is improving that
lack of control and shakiness that i
tend to see at lockout
some people tend to struggle more off
the floor whereas i tend to struggle
more at lockout as i lose my grip and
hip stability
so that's something i've been working on
by really hammering low block pulls
every other week
i think that's made a big difference for
me and as you can see from the way i'm
holding the bar here at lockout i really
don't think my grip or lockout stability
was a limiting factor on this lift so
i'm really happy to see that as well
okay so let's have a look at how my
squat test went so i started with 455
pounds here which is my new sort of
comfortable benchmark weight that i feel
like i could hit on pretty much any day
so after i hit that for my last warm-up
set i threw on another 10 pounds to
bring it up to 465
and believe it or not this is actually
the first time that i've put this weight
on my back in years
and as you can see it moved extremely
well to the point that
i was actually surprised with it i had
planned to just hit that minimum pr
weight with 465 pounds and stopped there
but i thought it was just a little bit
too easy so i decided i'd go up
another 10 pounds and hit one more rep
with 475
so i set up in the low bar position got
everything nice and tight
unwrapped the bar by thrusting my hips
forward and then the walkout was a bit
shaky and i'll come back to that in a
second
took a big deep breath into my gut as i
pushed out against my belt
nice controlled descent solid depth and
then good speed on the positive
so overall i'm obviously really happy
with this and there are two things that
i've been focusing on lately with my
squat
the first is literally telling myself to
trust my back more
because i do have this tendency to try
to stay as upright as possible because
of the lower back issues that i've had
in the past
but when you squat low bar that can
really throw off your balance and you do
need to get comfortable with allowing a
bit more forward lean
than what you'd want with a high bar
squat now obviously some of you guys
might have the exact opposite problem
you might lean
too far forward on the squat and allow
your chest to sort of cave in
in which case a cue like driving your
back into the bar
might be more helpful for you but for me
i really need to remind myself that it's
okay to have some forward lean
and that my back is strong and i'm
feeling totally fine the other thing is
my walkout is not quite as stable as i'd
like it to be so i've been including
some occasional heavy walkouts just to
prime my nervous system
for what that kind of weight feels like
on my back without actually doing a rep
so i'll just walk something heavy out
and then walk it back in and i've added
a few of those walkouts toward the end
of the new power building program as
well
all right so i wanted to put together a
couple concrete takeaways from these new
pr's so you guys can apply them to your
own training
first i would say one of the biggest
things that i've seen results from on
this training block
is all the focus on technique work i
really feel like i'm in a good groove
now where pretty much
every rep that i do looks pretty much
exactly the same at least on the squat
in the deadlift
i do think my bench still needs a little
bit more technique work and of course
the only way to do that is to include a
reasonable amount of sub-maximal work in
your program
because research consistently shows us
that as you approach failure on a lift
your technique will start to break down
so it's extremely important to include
some sub-maximal relatively lighter
technique work
at least once a week if you want to keep
raising your strength ceiling
without having to go balls to the wall
every time and risk injury or burnout
second this might seem like an obvious
one but outside of the program technique
work i've actually been training really
hard what i've been doing on this
program
is every second week i'll do one heavy
top set for anything from two to eight
reps depending on where i'm at in the
program
where i try to either beat an old rep pr
or set a new pr
for that rep count and then when i run
the program again i'll try to beat the
weight that i did for each of those rep
maxes the first time i went through
again these aren't actually all out
break your back sets
i'm just trying to get close to or hit a
new rep pr somewhere in that
rpe 8 to 9 zone which when you actually
do it
is actually a really hard set and i
think i've seen a lot of strength and
size gains
from that combination of fairly regular
rep maxes and then steady technique work
in between so guys i've got a power
building science explained video on the
way in the next couple weeks describing
all this in a lot more detail so you
guys can stay tuned for that
and if you're interested in running my
new power building program yourself you
