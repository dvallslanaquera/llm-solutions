hey folks dr mike here for rp
plus renaissance periodization and all
those other funny acronyms
hypertrophy concepts and tools lecture
number 16
excessively high frequencies last time
we talked about excessively low
frequencies let's see what's on the menu
for today
first of all we'll talk about why the
fuss why it's possible to have these
frequencies
be excessively high and then we'll talk
about nine specific reasons
why excessive frequency can be a problem
and then lastly we'll talk about how to
sort of synthesize this and make some
recommendations to make sure we're not
doing excessively high frequencies so
why the fuss
first of all doing less volume per
session
but more frequent sessions means you get
about the same muscle growth as you get
with less frequent sessions
but with more volume per session tends
to cancel out for many frequencies
that's not really a good argument for
high frequencies because unless you like
to train a muscle group really often
you could say just you know doing a
couple extra sets while you're already
warmed up etc
is just same amount of growth but it
seems like for short periods of time at
least
one to two mesocycles you could probably
get superior results
better results with higher frequencies
that is both equated for volume and
not equated for volume because with
higher frequencies you can do more
volume so it's a sort of double benefit
however if we take that trend too far
then we run into problems because you
could say gee you know four times a week
training works
well better than two for some amount of
time
eight time a week training should work
great and then you run into a problem of
excessively high frequencies and there
are a couple of reasons
why that's not a really really good
thing
and at some point essentially because
you have to control for per session
volume the volumes are really really low
precession
and the sessions are too frequent what
does that mean how does that happen
let's take a look at those
nine independent downsides
so first one is
post activation potentiation let's say
we were endeavor to do
one working set per session and do
i don't know whatever our mav is 14
sessions per week
twice a day you do one set of chests in
the am one set of chests in the pm
every day for seven days let's say that
was a thing
post activation potentiation is that
after one hard working set
many times you are able to repeat or
exceed your performance on the next
working set
because that working set first one
functioned as both a warm up
and a working set after you've activated
the musculature you get a potentiation
effect
now if you say well that just means
you're not adequately warmed up
sure but then if you're training with
high frequencies and you warm up a lot
you're spending a whole lot of time in
the gym that you might not need to be
just to do one working set so you might
as well do two working sets at that
point
but if you can do two working sets one
functions as a work set and a warm up
and the next one is just as good of a
set you get just as many reps so on and
so forth and
maybe even recruit more fast rich muscle
fibers which a lot of times happens
with post activation potentiation then
maybe all of a sudden for the literal
same amount of time investment you do
two working sets versus
one working set with a bunch of warm-ups
and if you could do two working sets
like that
maybe you could just do three working
sets and the potentiation effect
probably lasts that long
and the third set maybe is not as high
quality but still really high quality
we'll get to other reasons why it's a
good idea to do that third set
with the very least of someone saying
let's just do one set and then leave the
gym
probably doing two sets spending the
same amount of time getting more
hypertrophy a little less warming up a
little bit more work
is probably wise and when you start
doing two sets per session
uh you know might be a little bit more
fatigue and maybe you can't do 14
sessions anymore
maybe you can only do seven sessions
right so there's an automatic argument
for excessively high frequencies being
not so great
that it your first set potentiates at
least the second and to some extent even
the third set of performance
you end up putting three really high
quality sets back to back to back
and you're off to a really good start so
it's sort of like when you're in the gym
you might as well stay in the gym for a
while which means you there's a certain
minimum volume per session that you
should accumulate because it's just
really really efficient
and then after that you could go home
and still have a very high frequency
but if you cut it off before then like
instead of doing three or four sets per
muscle group per session
if you just do one you may be doing such
a high frequency that it's going to be
needless to do that at the very least
right number two
total work versus faster fiber stimulus
this one's on shaky ground
if it has an effect it's probably a very
small effect but we still have to
consider them
so in any set you do as you get closer
to failure especially when it's a set of
let's say
10 to 20 roughly 15 reps let's just use
15.
15 reps let's just keep it simple to say
to failure we know
by the effect of reps concept the last
five reps of that set are probably the
most hypertrophic
it doesn't mean the first 10 or not but
it certainly means the first five of
those 15
is not super hypertrophic because the
faster fibers aren't very super active
yet
they are active to some extent but not
maximally and so they don't get real
much and they're the ones that grow the
most
you know so reps number five through ten
they're very hypertrophic and
10 through 15 is super hypertrophic and
more than that i mean
it's one of those up like this it's not
like that right
but generally speaking your last five
reps are gonna be your sort of higher
quality reps
if you just do one set every single time
you come to the gym and you leave
let's say it's a set of 15 you have
essentially you could describe roughly
10
lead-in reps that don't cause a ton of
hypertrophy not your best hypertrophy
and you have five reps in that set that
cause your best hypertrophy well
what if you did a set like that and then
you did your next set after a good
amount of rest
now since the first step was to failure
and you rested a normal amount of time
maybe instead of 15 reps you got 10 reps
on this nexus that's still a very
hypertrophic set
but it turns out that instead of
you know 10 lead in reps i remember the
last five reps are the most hypertrophic
in a set of 10
you now have five lead in reps and five
maximally hypertrophic reps so the
amount of faster fiber stimulus or
relative to total work done
is better right imagine
we do using more extreme examples sets
of 30 reps
the first 25 reps are more lead-in than
the best hypertrophy that if you allowed
yourself to do multiple sets you would
fatigue in such a way
that the last five reps would be a
bigger fraction of each
set coming up to a set of 30 the last
five reps are only one-sixth of that
instead of 40 they're only
one-fourth of that more right or i said
four good guy instead of 20
than one-fourth of that in a set of 10
they're half as half your reps are the
highest quality most
uh growth causing reps so there's
something to that idea
that and it's especially one of these
things where it's the local fatigue
that's sort of causing this
that as you do more and more sets yes
the hypertrophy
from each set additively declines but
remember the same thing happens for
adding frequency to your program
so that's a canceled out argument
altogether but while it declines
it declines a little maybe less fast
than we would think right
and in that case we are able to have
more faster fiber stimulus
relative to total stimulus thus your
stimulus to fatigue ratio
may actually be pretty decent for more
than just one set
right your stimulus to fatigue ratio on
the second set might be pretty similar
to what it was
uh on the first set and thus it might be
worth it to stick around to do another
set and maybe another one and maybe
another so instead of just doing one set
per session
maybe because our faster fiber stimulus
relative to total work
same concept that goes exactly into mile
reps maybe we could have a slightly
better result if we stick around
and use that local fatigue to our
advantage to get into that best
hypertrophy zone for more fractions of
those sets
maybe right number three
mind muscle connection potentiation this
one's super straightforward
your first set often feels like fucking
weird dog shit you don't know if your
biceps are activated you just kind of
lift the weight yeah you get a bunch of
reps who knows what muscles are involved
but if you zoom in on the per the
specific muscle as you do more and more
sets to a point
we calculated rp or calculated estimate
that at roughly five to seven sets
uh at least in the same exercise
your uh at least in the first three sets
and probably three or four
your mind muscle connection improves
with every single set and
you have no doubt experienced this first
set of leg presses feels kind of strange
when you get good you
got a lot of wraps but like you're just
sort of feeling the groove towards the
last couple wraps
then the next set you're really grooving
it you're warmed up super well you feel
a ton of tension through your quads
and not a ton of fatigue because you've
gotten your stance right and everything
you can feel it super well
and then the next set you just total
nuclear disaster it's awesome
and then if you keep doing sets after
three or four sure
the um mind muscle connection can drop
off and it can be like you're just doing
work again maybe it's time to move away
to another exercise or maybe even stop
the session but there's a mind
muscle uh the potentiation thing
where your first set might be your most
hypertrophic
it just has to be because it just fills
in the bar the highest and
the rest is up to the other sets to take
of potential hypertrophy
there might be a thing where because
mind muscle connection improves a little
bit with every set for a few number of
sets
that if you were to just leave after one
set or even two sets
you would be leaving these super high
quality sets on the table
and then every time you come back and do
another session remember your mind
muscle connection's not that great you
have to re-warm up
this is a little bit canceled out by the
fact that if you train more frequently
your technique gets better
but then again if you train really
frequently your technique can degrade
from just overexposure so there's a
balance there
where it's like you know the expression
in for penny and for a pound
if you're in for one set of working set
you might as well do another at least
one probably two or three more because
that mind muscle improves set to set
there's some benefit there
to keep going it at least mitigates the
stimulus to fatigue ratio
loss you would expect with sets over and
over and over again
next one is technical potentiation this
one's super simple super related to my
muscle connection
your first set of squats your toes might
have been pointed out a little too much
okay everyone makes that mistake every
now and again or too forward
but on your second set like if you only
do one set per session your frequency is
that high 14 sessions per week
you only do once that per session you're
like fuck okay next session i'm going to
remember to point them out you get to
the next session as fucking hours later
you're like
where did i have my feet right who the
fuck knows right and your
quads might have shifted to fluid volume
to the last session you might have eaten
the meal so on and so forth so now
you it might actually be a different
foot position to get your best feel
but if you do multiple sets of the same
exercise or the same muscle group
you can alter the technique to where
your third
second third fourth sets are
incrementally better and better and
better technique you settle
into the technique even for that day or
just for that exercise always because
you know okay the first set technique
was
meh but i can turn my feet in a little
bit you turn your feet in your seconds
that's awesome you're like oh you know
what
if i move my heels up a little bit i
think i can get an even better feel
and that third set it's fucking gravy
and that fourth set you've already
figured all these things out you've paid
that cost you might as well do a fourth
set because it's going to be an awesome
set it might not be any better than the
third
but you're grooving right it's like just
learning how to sort of ride your bike a
little bit
and your dad's like all right time to go
have dinner you're like uh
i'm for balancing for the first time let
me at least get this high quality work
in so i don't have to relearn balancing
tomorrow so on and so forth right so
when you're in the groove
don't fuck with the groove this covers
actually a lot of these
right definitely something there
especially with technique
cell swelling and metabolites they may
very well be
especially for more advanced lifters a
certain amount of
threshold involved in self-swelling
metabolites whereby if the muscle cell
that's used to being uh uh swelled
and has already milked out the minimum
hypertrophy for minimum swelling
it may be the effect that if you have
minimum swelling for the kind of pump
you get from one or two sets
they might actually at some point cause
no additive hypertrophy for especially
more advanced lifters
and that only a great degree of swelling
causes any incremental detection of
hypertrophy
same idea for metabolites a certain
summation of metabolites in the cell
may if some maximal vary some maximal
cause no added growth or very very
little added growth
and then just going that extra number of
sets gets the metabolites to really sum
up to where you have notable or much
larger degrees of hypertrophy
it's kind of like a you know if i in for
a penny in for a pound right
and and more than that it's kind of like
you know
if you are gonna make something an
effort to train
you have to make a minimum effort at
some point or things
don't just don't happen uh easy analogy
here is kind of um
getting a massage how come five minute
massages are really rare
and maybe you can have like 20 of them
per day well one of the big things
in the literature truth be told the only
thing that massage has a benefit on it's
a huge benefit is
a recovery and that's from relaxation
right but like how many people can
really relax from a five minute massage
i don't know about you guys i don't get
massages very often
but when i do five minutes it's kind of
you just kind of like okay okay okay
stop thinking about work
just blah listen that stupid meditation
music they play just kidding sort of
and and then you really like 15 20
minutes later
you're really relaxed and that's when
the relaxation
starts to happen and starts to affect
you the
getting relaxed doesn't really get you
anything it's just to prep for the
process
once you are relaxed then it's great so
i got a massage session of 30 minutes an
hour that is like you know 20 minutes
or 40 minutes of meat and potatoes
relaxation
that's awesome in a similar way it might
be
that cell swallowing metabolites which
do contribute to hypertrophy though not
exclusively uh it might be that up until
you get a good
amount of both salsa metabolites you're
really just priming the pump
and if you pry the pump private pump
then leave there might not be as much
growth maybe no growth there for
advanced folks
so there is such a thing as you know you
do one set of
of chest press and someone's like are
you
pumped you're like no not yet one set
doesn't get pumped and you're like all
right
super crazy burn in there and you have
trouble flexing your muscle like
no not at all uh let's leave and then
come back five hours later and do
another
set of chest presses right so then we
can't really check the boxes uh
as much or maybe at all of cell
swallowing metabolites actually causing
an effect on growth
so maybe if we're going to do one set
maybe we could do two three and even
four we get
really robust self-swelling effect
really robust metabolite effect for sure
we've put in a ton of tension
and then maybe it's a really really good
thing maybe so that's something to
consider
point number six is one of those that's
not so debatable it's just
very very clear it's a clear win for
lower frequency
if you try with a very high frequency
you will be doing a whole lot of warming
up
one of the easiest ways to explain this
is if you do
only one warm-up set which is ridiculous
most people do more let's say only one
only one warm-up set in one working set
then your week can be categorized as a
one-to-one ratio of warm-up to work so
that's one half of the time that you
were in the gym
assuming both sets take about as much
time which both sides really usually do
um
you spend half your fucking time warming
up okay
okay what if you
take one more upset still but do two
working sets
you have a two to one ratio now that's
so much better than a one-to-one ratio
of working out to warming up
if you're like most people you trade
with at least two or three working sets
per session more like three or four
you know that's a three or four to one
ratio of working out to warming up
you're mostly working up
but honestly think about it from a real
world perspective if
you want maximum efficiency time
efficiency of your training
and half of your training is spent
warming up good god
and and there's another priming the pump
effect there or the in in for a penny in
for a pound effect
what's a quickie you're warmed up
already you've done one set now you're
really warmed up
going back to point number one as
opposed to activation potentiation
and why not do another set uh
it's not going to be as productive as
the first set maybe by a very small
amount but holy crap it improves your
efficiency like crazy
something to be said for something
absolutely to be sad
next one another non-debatable one or
of course it's debatable but it's pretty
highly convincing
point number seven joint and connective
tissue versus muscle recovery time
course
discordance that's a lot of sciency talk
for if you train with very high
frequencies the muscles tend to recover
a little bit faster than joints
connective tissues
tendons ligaments aponeurosis etc and
what ends up happening is
for some time that means you get great
muscle growth but then you run
run on dry land and you end up getting
in a real overreach scenario with your
connective tissues
and your joints and then it's not
sustainable
so this isn't to say so much that high
frequency training is a bad idea
all the time or sorry some of the time
it's a bad idea all the time because
eventually you won't be able to recover
in a sustainable fashion
because most bodybuilders don't alter
the frequencies on purpose they just
want one sort of dependable frequency
many bodybuilders default to one or two
sessions per week per muscle group
because
those cannot possibly uh in any real
sense
lead to a connective tissues becoming a
limiting factor problem
but if you're you know training four or
six times a week for muscle
that may not be sustainable for the
connective tissues for nearly as long as
it's sustainable for the muscles
and you might perennial run into really
really big problems right so that's
definitely something to consider
maybe not from saying high frequencies
are bad or there's such a thing as too
high frequency but
certainly such a thing is too high a
frequency for too long at a time
number eight local versus systemic
fatigue ratio you have a certain amount
of work to do
let's say you're training chest and back
this is the example we're going to be
using in the book
you can let's say do four sets per
session that's what you do and you do it
multiple times a week
chest and back if you do four sets of
back
four sets of chest next time four sets
of back next time after that four sets
of chest
it's just chest or back for four sets in
a row
you get same a certain amount of
systemic fatigue at the end of that
session
but you get uh a lot of local fatigue
because you train the same muscle over
and over local fatigue accumulates
remember local fatigue eventually is bad
but local fatigue via
cell swelling metabolites maybe some
fiber type stuff
also causes you to have a little bit of
hypertrophy so it's both hypertrophic
and antihypertrophic okay so
your local systemic fatigue ratio in the
last two sets of chest
or back like four sets of chest or four
sets of back in the last two sets of
both of those
your local fatigue is here your systemic
fatigue is here so the ratio is like one
to one
not terrible right some of that causes
growth and systemic fatigue
low fatigue causes some growth system of
fatigue doesn't cause any growth at all
all that what if you start doing a
situation
where every workout is mixed right
higher frequency per muscle group double
the frequency
every workout is two sets of chest two
sets of back or two sets of back two
sets of chest
for those last two sets of whatever it
is let's say back
the systemic fatigue of those last two
sets is the same because chest and back
contribute roughly the same systemic
fatigue
but the local fatigue in those first two
sets could be almost zero to start out
by the end of the two sets
pretty low because you're essentially
after two sets of chests coming to back
tired systemically tired and now your
systemic
inhibition of growth is pretty high but
your local fatigue contribution to
growth is very low
so the systemic to local fatigue ratio
shifts in favor of the systemic
and now you're just training tired a lot
if you're going to train tired
you might as well be tired from the
local muscle itself because that kind of
tiredness
also makes you grow but if you mix and
match too much and you do too much whole
body training let's say where you every
single session you do every single
muscle group you have
six days a week you do six you know
quads every day glutes every day blah
blah blah
you end up having that towards the end
of those workouts the systemic fatigue
is massive but the local fatigue is
relatively small because you didn't have
a chance to accumulate it
which means it's more junk volume than
if you concentrated
on every single muscle getting its due
diligence and then leaving the gym
or fewer muscles being stuck in together
right
that's a bit of a technical one so feel
free to rewind and re-listen again and
there's other
contexts in which i describe this it's a
very theoretical thing but it almost
certainly happens
and it's something to think about right
you want the muscle to be trashed
not to do two sets of pull downs after
you've done a bunch of benching and
someone's like hey man those you really
feel those on your back you're like
no because i'm too tired from bench but
if you're too tired from bent rows
then those sets of pull downs are giving
you an even bigger pump now which
you don't have to build from scratch so
definitely something to consider
lastly excessive systemic fatigue this
is a very interesting one
if you train with a very high frequency
you are actually able to raise your per
session volumes pretty considerably
to the point where overall weekly volume
can get crazy high i've tried this
myself
where my training partners and i have
tried to train with 12 sessions per week
total not per muscle group but that
meant four per muscle group training
sessions every time
the volume we could end up doing was so
high it exceeded our systemic mrv and we
just couldn't survive
so if you say to yourself man if i do
really high frequency quad training
and glue training in hamstring training
six days a week
i can get a net total greater amount of
sets done per week and grow
100 can you survive that systemically
doing a leg day every single day maybe
not if you're advanced
definitely not right so sometimes
super high frequencies per muscle end up
allowing you to do so much work that
they take you over your systemic mrv
it's just something to be aware of which
is to say not
chasing high frequencies blindly as the
golden thing that's going to get you all
the gains you have to put it in context
not going blind so with that let's focus
on the recommendations
here they are if a muscle
isn't sore and performance is back up
over baseline
you can train asap no problem in the
last
lecture we said you should train soon
and not dilly dally too much
to make sure your frequencies aren't too
low to make sure your frequencies aren't
too high it's definitely not a problem
if you train asap no big deal so if
you're not sore and your performance is
back to baseline you can train no
worries
but at the same time if you do
so high frequency of training that
in order to squish that much frequency
into your week you're reducing your per
session volume to less than three to
four sets per muscle group per session
at the very least from an efficiency
perspective and almost certainly from a
connective tissue perspective
you're just not doing the best job you
could be right and for mind muscle and
there's a couple other ones that all sum
up to
saying at least this the benefit
of training with frequencies so high
that you can only do one or two sets per
session
is probably at least no higher and maybe
a little lower
than a frequency that allows you to
train at least three to four cents per
session
so then why would you do one or two it
causes all these problems
it's really really inefficient and you
don't have to do it
at the very least and in the best case
it might actually be a little worse
so the super super take home point here
is if you're designing a frequency of
training
and you sort of know your mrv you know
how long it takes you to recover you say
okay i want to train quads four days a
week
but at least one of those days is gonna
have to be like just one or two sets of
quads
just condense consolidate and do three
quads a week
where at least you do three or four sets
per session and in that case
you're getting amazing workouts maybe
the best
and not going excessively into high
frequencies in a sort of programmatic
fashion
you end up having to lose efficiency on
the other end right
it's kind of like programming yourself
to eat 12 meals per day instead of six
uh what's the benefit of 12 meals
there's probably no big downside but
there's no additional benefit beyond six
and there's a huge convenience cost very
very similar to training frequency
right um most muscles can recover from
three plus sets
at least three times a week some even
higher five to six but
some muscles cannot recover as quickly
and can't even do three times a week in
advanced athletes that are very strong
hamstrings chest and quads often can
only be trained hard twice a week
because anything else is overkill that's
absolutely a thing
um and you know yeah you can train them
more times
by making each session one or two sets
and then you wonder why you're doing
that especially with muscles that
require a lot of warm-up that turns into
a ton of work
if you're training if you're very strong
400 plus pounds squatter
you're training quads you know four or
five times a week
that's a whole shitload of warming up
where if you just train them two or
three times a week
the warming up isn't nearly as excessive
because once you're warm you can just
keep doing work sets and even when you
change exercises you just need to
minimally warm up or not at all where it
just makes a whole lot more sense from a
time efficiency perspective
right definitely something to think
about so you don't want to
just assume that every muscle can do 3x
or 4x or 5x
you got to go muscle by muscle and
lastly when shooting for very high
frequencies
keep in mind the connective tissue
recovery problems
and only do this for one or two mesos at
a time
really push super high frequencies that
you know are costing your connective
tissues it's okay to do
for one or two minutes at a time and
then go back to lower frequencies or
intermediate frequencies for a while
let your connective tissues and joints
and so on and forth recover
and then you can make another push into
higher frequencies
give that some thought folks see you
next time for the next lecture
