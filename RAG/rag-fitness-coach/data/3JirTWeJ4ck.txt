don't rush only start imposing a willful
deficit when you know you're in a good
place and you know how your body for
lack of a better term how you feel with
the whole process if eating in this
regimented manner is pretty much second
nature to you you're going to start if
it still feels weird and awkward and
like oh what am I doing and you're
trouble measuring and all this other
stuff give it some more time don't
impose a deficit right away because the
deficit makes everything harder and I do
mean everything all about your life
including your diet
