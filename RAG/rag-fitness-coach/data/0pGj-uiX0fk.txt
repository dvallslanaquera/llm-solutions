Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here with
another Muscle In Minutes Q&A where I give
quick, to the point answers to your fitness
questions.
So, today’s question is, what are the best
foods out there to eat to naturally boost
your testosterone levels.
So my advice here is just to recognize the
fact that optimizing your natural testosterone
levels is really not going to be determined
by whether you specifically eat oysters or
nuts or avocado, but instead it’s going
to be determined by your overall diet and
your overall lifestyle as a whole.
You’ll find a lot of articles online that
list things like “10 super-foods that boost
your testosterone” or something along those
lines, but really that just sort of misses
the big picture.
The truth is that there really aren’t any
“special” food items out there that are
going to magically make a big measurable difference
to your testosterone levels on their own,
and instead I really would recommend that
you just focus on the more basic, overall
factors, so, make sure that you’re getting
enough fat in your diet, this is a really
important one, so somewhere between 20-30%
of your total calories and definitely no lower
than 15%, you want to make sure that you’re
getting enough protein so somewhere around
1 gram per pound of body weight daily, that
you’re getting a good restful sleep each
night, that you’re training intensely in
the gym on a consistent basis, that you’re
managing stress levels effectively, and that
you’re getting enough of certain vitamins
and minerals, specifically vitamin D, zinc
and magnesium which is a topic that I addressed
in a previous video and I'll link in the description
box below.
Eating certain food sources might help out
simply because they might be higher in fat
and protein content which might help to bring
your daily totals into the proper range if
they’re currently too low, but assuming
that your overall macronutrient intake is
properly structured at the outset, then going
out of your way to consume a higher amount
of red meat or egg yolks that's really not
going to magically boost your testosterone
levels into an above-normal range, and also
keep in mind that if your testosterone levels
are already within the normal range to begin
with, then there’s not a lot you can do
aside from actual anabolic steroid use to
further raise those levels high enough in
order to positively impact muscle growth or
gym performance anyway.
