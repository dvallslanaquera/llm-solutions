I got to control the out of my
Ecentric I got to make sure every rep is
the exact same whenever it starts to get
hard you lean into that pain and
you make sure that you're going pretty
close to failure when you're training
and really man that's just like the key
to all this consistency and leaning into
the pain and training very close
to Bellard and whenever you start
getting away from that and you're just
jerking the weight around and you
grow a little less optimally it's not
going to be as good so it's finding what
exercises and what stances and widths
for you allow you to get into those four
ranges lotion from there you then start
working your back bridge
