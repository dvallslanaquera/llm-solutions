oh it's good to be back dr james dr mike
here on youtube answering your very
interesting but sometimes ridiculous
questions dr mike how's it going
we only picked the ridiculous ones
wouldn't that be fucked up if we pick
like the worst possible questions
i thought that's what sports scientist
was for that's right
you know we only pick questions of
massive internal contradiction
so yeah oh man i forgot to tell you
before we started i've been getting
like people making fake profiles on
instagrams and you know like when you
check your messages and you get like a
weird message
message requests i've been getting the
same guy who's keeps making different
fake accounts
trying to say like dr james i heard you
say this thing that clearly i didn't i
never said
um and he's trying to argue with me and
i just have been deleting them and he
just keeps making new fake accounts
totally nuts and then it's like hey you
didn't respond to my other message
using a different account like which
which message oh which one
yes you're not well zero posts
follows 100 you know like following
one yeah you know you want a troll
account have fun but don't expect people
to treat you like a human you're a troll
you'd be treated like a troll
yeah it's a fake ass profile anyway
you ready i'm ready let's do it
six five one two chris
god damn it six five one two chris
got it says hey docs
uh we know that full rom is important
five percent outcomes
there therefore are exercises like
dumbbell lateral raises where there's
very little tension to no tension on the
target muscle through part of the range
of motion
less good for hypertrophy outcomes
essentially as there's some minimum
amount of tension required through the
entire range of motion to maximize
hypertrophy
that's a very very good question i
actually dive into this
in a video that uh i
believe maybe out already on rp but give
it a look
um no it's not out we recorded it though
um
the thing is we're so far ahead in
recordings that there's like months
ahead of where the videos release
but um i believe the video hasn't been
out yet but it will
it's going to get into the nuances of
like force curves
and how much you should pay attention to
that and the easy answer is
if you have a choice between two
exercises you always pick the best sfr
exercise kind of give a shit what the
fuck biomechanic says you can't feel
your delts and there's no pump
disruption soreness etc then just
fucking i don't know like
biomechanics is is oftentimes very
different person to person in the sense
that you know
the way you're actually moving the
muscles you actually activate so on and
so forth
may not be the ones that are predicted
to do so in a very very simple
junior level free body diagram so that
being said sfr always wins or almost
always wins
however you will notice that you
probably get better sfrs with
exercises in which the muscle is active
through
more range of motion so if you have two
exercises you want to try and you don't
know the sfr and you're like i need an
effective delt builder i don't have a
mesocycle to figure out which sfr
probably try the ones where the force is
applied
more of the time so just on the shear
estimate numbers like that
something like a free motion cable cross
lateral
where you do this right and the it's a
cable so the force is
essentially the same the entire time on
paper looks really good compared to a
freeway dumbbell
lateral raise in reality it usually ends
up being very similar
because you'll notice there's something
i could i don't know what it is
might be momentum or something like that
there's something to free weights that
seems to just give really ball or so far
as compared to machines even on a
technical level
the machine seemed to be better um just
seems to fuck you up a lot and it seems
to be a good thing too many people swear
by free weights
uh for it i think all be myth so at the
end of the day yeah so far matters
but look if you can change an exercise
to have to cover more range of motion
that's great so my the exercise that i
done recently the super rom laterals if
you have healthy shoulders and they
don't bother you
notice like typical laterals you would
stop at 90 degrees which means only like
the top 45 degrees is really plenty of
tension
in superram laterals you actually get
the top 45 degrees and then the above
that 45 degrees right
so ends up being 90 degrees of pretty
good tension
for you know that movement so that's
pretty sweet
then again and this is why i made this
this whole video on this topic for later
when you're not applying a ton of
tension on that muscle that muscle is
actually resting
so then every rep turns into a little
bit of a rest pause which can actually
hit your faster switch fibers really
well
they don't just get fatigued they go
hard then they rest they go hard then
they rest
and as long as it's not a tiny tiny
force curve where they're active turning
into mostly an isometric
that rest ability for them to rest
during the rep while other muscles take
over
might actually give like a rest pause
kind of effect and
somewhat make up for their their
qualities on the uh
force curve so yes oh so number one look
for the best sfr
whatever force curve criteria number two
within similar estimated sfrs or you
just don't know
yeah more range of motion applied to the
muscle is usually
better but they usually doesn't mean
always so don't take that too far and
there are ways in which other factors
the exercise
can make up for that james yeah that was
a really good answer so this is a hard
one not to just go into like
intellectual masturbation but you know
and and like force curves and whatnot
but just just to keep in mind and just a
really simple example with like a
lateral raise or something like that
it is true you might not be keeping a
lot of tension on those target muscles
throughout the whole range
but alternatively when they do
uh activate and have a lot of tension
running through it might just be hitting
a really good swap
of that muscle itself so even if it's
not ideal through the full range of
motion
when it is being targeted it's being
targeted very well and
kind of with the delts it's kind of a
funny conundrum where you say like well
that doesn't seem like
a great movement for the delts well it's
like okay well what's your next options
you got like upright rows
overhead presses which then you're
making basically an sfr trade-off
between the other kind of
um synergistic muscles and compound
movements that you're making whereas
you know with the isolation exercise it
might not be
ideal all the way through but it might
actually hit that muscle really well and
the trade-offs might be really good
when you factor in like just hitting a
sufficient volume for mev volumes and
stuff like that
another thing to think about too is like
different muscles will respond to that
same idea in different ways where
something like a bicep curl
might get a ton of loaded stretch and
muscle growth stimulus from the very
bottom of a range you know whereas uh
the lateral rays you kind of see that
mid-range being kind of like the golden
zone for that movement so they're all a
little bit different
because they might be responding to
different force curves different muscle
mechanics
different stretch tension relationships
it's a really good question it's not
something that can be
always answered with like a blanket um
statement but i think what dr mike said
was a great jumping off point for
most muscles so don't give it too much
thought unless it's
just you barely get any activation at
all because it's such a partial
and the real big one is if the sfr sucks
especially the raw stimulus magnitude
you're like i know this is supposed to
be five shoulders i don't feel a fucking
thing
play with your technique but sometimes
the exercise just sucks and like so i
hate to keep using this example
but we always do and might as well keep
it going um mike and i always differ in
like our
quad stimulus with the knee extension
machine right and so you might be like
oh well
the knee extension like you're only
getting like roughly 90 degrees
could it be that great for the quads
well i don't know it leaves me pretty
fucking crippled
when i'm doing it so for me like i feel
pretty good about that you know what i
mean so you don't want to just use that
as your only marker there's definitely
other markers you're going to be looking
for for sfr and mev indicators
so as long as you're kind of in the
ballpark with all those things it
probably doesn't matter a ton
next up is muhammad nader
i think that one was close to the top i
remember the name
got it varying rate of loss within a fat
loss phase hey docs do you guys think
it's a good idea to have different rates
of
fat loss throughout one fat loss phase
for a 12-week maintenance to lose 10 of
my body weight i'm 17 to 20 percent body
fat
and we know we can lose more of a start
because we have more fat and less diet
fatigue
and we okay so so real quick just real
quick and i know james is thinking the
same thing
yes you can but you can also run real
fast at the beginning of the marathon
and get tired and not finish the race
yeah you can sprint the beginning of
marathon you can't really sprint at the
end
because you're tired but you got to pace
yourself so
good thoughts great thoughts but let's
see if we can't peel them apart a little
bit
and then it says we also know being
aggressive with the diet for a short
period doesn't risk muscle loss again
it's not a short period you gotta have
12 weeks after that motherfucker and if
you already redline the shit
what are you going to do so for example
losing 1.5
per week for the first four weeks then
going slower and losing 0.5 per week for
the next eight weeks
the length of the phase of total weight
loss is similar to what you guys
recommend but it's non-linear just want
to know what to expect to decide to go
with it
thank you for the informative content
well uh muhammad thank you so much for
tuning in and
actually very very great question what i
tend to find is a
uh the rule that works best is a
two-point rule for
fat loss uh and this actually is a rule
you can apply
in a slightly modified manner to a lot
of processes
rule one the total amount of stress on
the system
is uh dictated into
almost entirely almost entirely by the
total magnitude of change you're going
for
so if you say what's harder a five-week
diet where i lose
10 pounds or a 10-week diet where i lose
10 pounds well
probably about the same difficulty
because one just crams it in one spreads
it out right like
that's the thing right so um you know
it's like saying
you know if uh what's difficult here
we're applying this rule to travel
um what's more difficult uh straight
flight to singapore that takes fucking
18 hours in the air
or a stopover in hawaii that four hours
you get to eat at a hawaiian restaurant
come back get on the plane it's nine and
nine or whatever but four hours in the
middle
who gets it's about the same difficulty
it's just a different kind of difficulty
nobody's going to tell you like
18 hour flight's just easy as fuck you
get in and it's one shot
and and on the other hand no one's going
to tell you look look when you fly two
nine hour flights back to back and you
sit in an airport for four hours it's
the easiest thing in the world like
they're both pretty fucked up just in
their own separate ways
and then you start to zone into what is
it really that makes flights hard it's
the fucking magnitude man it's how far
you're fucking going right
you decide to take like you know elon
musk's trip to mars is short of like
light speed travel that motherfucker is
going to tire you out you feel that's
just going to be real far away it's
going to take a real long time
so when people want to lose five pounds
they go should i take my time with it or
should i
lose it quick james i'm gonna probably
answer like it doesn't matter it's just
five pounds you want to lose 15 pounds
yeah you can do it faster but it's not a
good idea okay that's rule one rule two
or sub rule two
is there are maximum limits we don't
want to exceed because they cause
exponential rises in fatigue
and exponential decays and effectiveness
and efficiency
efficiency and increase the costs of the
dieting
that are non-linear so because we're
assuming like you know if
if you diet for 10 weeks or five weeks
if you're like this or like that
like it's all within the bounds of like
not insane
but you can get into the bounds where
it's completely insane
and per our renaissance diet book
really for for diets that aim to seek to
reduce 10
of your body weight which is fucking
napoleonic that's a serious diet
we really have seen a ton of clients we
mean thousands
if we count the rpe diet app hundreds of
thousands people
try the one percent or greater fat loss
it is just not fucking sustainable
it it some people can pull it off you
don't want to give yourself the benefit
of the doubt of some
you want to be like i'm this is almost
certainly going to work you know some
motherfucker went into exploring and
talking about himself and got back are
you getting
a fucking sled with three dogs probably
not right but a bunch of people go on
cruise ships and they come back fine
you know going to cruise ship is a
little safer so when you're saying
you're going to go 1.5
per week for the first four weeks if it
ended at four weeks golden
totally fine that's a mini cut baller
right even that's fast for a mini cut we
say many cut up to 1.25 but yeah fuck it
you know we get our blessing four weeks
1.5 whatever fucking
you lose a little bit of muscle you gain
some on the back end no big deal 1.5
is gonna leave you so fucked up after
four weeks what the fuck are you gonna
do for six weeks
you you've accumulated so much diet
fatigue and remember you're still
dieting which means your diet won't fall
at best it'll remain the same but
actually it'll just keep going it just
won't increase as
bad so it's kind of like they're taking
your engine on the air airliner and say
okay we can go 600 miles an hour fine
let's go to 700
and you burn the engine out and then you
reduce back to 500 you're like we could
just coast from here like we're not
coasting we're falling out of the
fucking sky
our engine's done you should have never
taken it to 700 for an hour because it's
fucking burned out
so that's where my thinking is james
what did i get wrong i don't think you
got anything wrong this is kind of like
the classic um beginner mistake
uh which is just biting off more than
you can chew and we see this in a
variety of different fitness and diet
stuff people want to have the
advanced training program right off the
get-go like homie you're a fucking
beginner like you don't need an advanced
training program you don't want an
advanced training program either you
just don't know it yet
uh same thing with this diet stuff like
you want to take the easiest gains that
you can
one thing that we see with people who
push these really high rates is they
usually have to really starve themselves
to death which is just like
you're gonna you're gonna be done in six
weeks whether you chose to or not
and or they pick a really uh egregious
amount of cardio which i found and some
people
can tolerate lots of cardio i'll just
cardio my way out of this right and so
then at that point you're also not
training for your physique anymore
you're just training to be a cardio
bunny
and i mean that like in a respectful way
but when you think about it's like okay
well you're doing one to two hours of
cardio per day are you
trying to be a bodybuilder or are you
trying to be a professional race walker
you know what i mean
and then the other problem you run into
with doing all that cardio is that you
actually become incredibly economical at
the cardio itself and so it has to keep
getting harder and harder and harder to
a ridiculous point where the idea was
you were supposed to take a little bit
of um you know energy intake restriction
a little bit of cardio and it's not that
bad and you're making great progress
right now
you're burnt out already from dieting
and you're having to set the fucking
incline on the treadmill of 15 and you
have to wear a weighted vest and you
have to do it for an hour
oh my god this is this is a classic
disaster just waiting to happen so
uh there aren't there are people i have
trained who
did something like that successfully but
they knew ahead of time that that was
the level of expectation that they were
walking into right they knew that it was
going to suck
and it had a finite ending point it was
not something where they were gonna go
oh i'll try 10 weeks and maybe i'll do
15 weeks if i'm really feeling good
that's kind of what one of my normal
one-on-one interactions is no it was
like we're doing this for
six weeks end of story no
no other choice right and that was that
was okay but anyone who tries to do that
with the expectation of going like 10 12
15 weeks homie
crash and bird so our you know our
recommendation is just like
take the easy gains there's reasons why
we set some of those upper and lower
recommendations some of it's facing
science some of it's based on our
experience
and we think those are really good take
the easy gains while you can't eat as
much
losses easy losses yeah sorry wrong
phrasing to eat as much food as you can
for as long as you can right this is one
of the other things you see people just
like cut their food right away and it's
like well where do you go now like
you know and that's why people like you
want to get to the end of a diet last
three weeks
and be like i gotta push now but i'm
okay to push i'm okay to survive three
years
versus like time to push and you're like
i'm fucking almost i have been pushing
this whole time what do you mean i got
nothing
now is there a technical agreement for
perhaps within that
0.25 to 1 loss going a little faster at
the front end there is but there are
just as many arguments against it
so it's not clear to myself i don't know
if it's clear to james
of even if there should be some some
kind of curvilinear behavior
inside though that window it's not
immediately apparent to me that that's
the case
maybe a little bit but maybe not i also
find that that level of precision is
just not achievable
totally totally it's like so it's kind
of like 2.67
i'm setting 1.5 this and then i'm
backing down it's like dude
just set a reasonable average pace and
roll with it just i mean like are you
gonna are you telling so
what you're telling me when you say
those things is that you are monitoring
your body weight and you're adjusting
your calories based on the changes that
you're seeing week to week and then at
some point
you're going to say well i had a change
that was working at 1.5 and now i'm
going to change my diet somewhere along
this point to get to 1.2 like
it's not going to happen come on it's a
good thought like i'm not hating on the
question
but maybe it's true it's probably just
not going to flesh out that way in
practice
dr mike i have to check on my dogs very
quickly i'll promise i'll be
right back i heard mysterious noises so
i'm just gonna peek my head around the
corner and i'll be right back
i'll just wait and scott will edit this
out yeah or you can just keep going and
i'll pick up where
i'll keep going yeah i'll start the
answer hit it
all right our next question is
from michalis
frangoo oh spicy indeed
he says according to traditional linear
periodization model volume decreases are
accompanied by intensity increase
throughout the training cycle
on the other hand oh james is back james
i'll just uh let's just do this from the
top because this is super easy you
missed almost nothing
uh michaelis frangoo
that sounds like a fancy cheese wait how
do you spell that
m-i-c-h-a
alice-friend go fuck a friend gu
farnguni you fucking fuck
tell me this guy was in like godfather 3
or something i hope so
according to the you know what's funny
is my sister was watching the sopranos
once and i was balls deep into a diet
i'm like i can't do this there's too
much delicious food on here man oh yeah
because tony's always eating i'm like
fuck this i can't
yeah it's gross watching him eat
sometimes too but like when you're super
hungry it's like
what a lucky asshole yeah uh all right
uh michalis frangoo says according to
the traditional linear improvisation
model volume decreases are accompanied
by intensity increases throughout the
training cycle
on the other hand dr mike's and others
metastatic design hypertrophy has the
athlete increasing volume as a cycle to
mesocycle
how do these two approaches compare in
their hypertrophy inducing potential of
why
in general i see this conflict in s
oriented exercise programs for example
notice how in this article mma athlete
is subjected to higher total workloads
as he
leads towards the competition on the
other hand it is common and he puts a
link
it is common in weightlifting to have
the athlete dramatically reduce volume
in favor of intensity leading up to
competition as an example what am i
missing here thanks doctor
so if you don't mind i'll since i was
yeah delinquent there for
for a second so there's two kind of
things i just want to tackle right off
the bat so
when you say traditional linear
periodization model
those models are not actually linear
they just assume
kind of like a steady increase in
intensity and deep
and or so i should say this other way
around a well no that's true
a steady increase in the intensity and
or specificity of training
which would come with corresponding
changes in volume to manage because you
can't survive that
yes right and so it's it's linear in
like a very superficial sense but none
of those things are truly linear
even the traditional periodization
models are um
undulating in many different ways but
for the sake of
you know conceptualizing these things
they're often described as linear so
just keep that in mind
it's not necessarily like a very cut and
dry intensity goes up volume goes down
they're kind of flexing and we see
average changes over time and that is
true
um so in this case you're actually
comparing and contrasting kind of some
of the hypertrophy stuff
with like a traditional sports and snc
model right and this is
yeah our strength um here we have the
fundamental
specificity problem of what it is what
is it that you're training for
right and so those traditional face
potentiation models work really well
for things like strength power speed
endurance and developing sports skills
and tactics and they've been tested and
worked really really well
that same model doesn't necessarily
apply very well to hypertrophy and
actually in hypertrophy training we see
almost kind of i don't want to say the
reverse but
kind of a very diverging path where some
of the things are similar
but we actually kind of go in almost the
opposite direction where it seems to
actually benefit the athlete
to to do their hypertrophy training
early on
as heavy as they can and as time goes by
increase the volume and decrease the
intensity to some degree across
mesocycles which is kind of the opposite
of preparing for sport competition so
it's not necessarily that these things
are not in line it's that they're just
constrained by specificity and in this
case the specificity of training for
hypertrophy or
we'll just call you know physique
training just diverges significantly
from strength and power sport at one
point and that's all that's really
it's not like it's not they don't they
don't jive the same principles apply
they just apply in different contexts
that's it hypertrophy has a requisite
range of intensities but volume within
that range is the main driver and
determinant so we drive the volume over
time
keeping the intensity good uh sometimes
even lowering it
whereas on the other hand strength and
sport performance
is mostly intensity mediated with a
range of effective volumes
so we end up peaking for intensity and
pushing intensity ahead
and then having to adjust volume after
that um
that that's really what it is it's no
different than if you want to go and get
dinner and a dessert
like depending on which one you want
more you eat less of the other and you
say look okay i noticed you ate a ton of
pasta here but you only had a cookie
after what's the deal with that because
last time i saw
you just eat a little bit of potatoes
and meat and had a huge cheesecake well
like well i just wanted to peek with the
dessert because i really wanted a
cheesecake like there's no right way to
do it
it's what do you want at the end if you
want to be strong at the end don't drive
up your volume a ton because that causes
great hypertrophy but it doesn't cause a
lot of
right there and then strength if you
want to be strong at the end you can't
be smashing yourself fatigue-wise with a
ton of volume
you got to start peaking and really just
revealing lower higher preparedness with
with higher
uh intensities that's it so totally
and it's kind of like if you guys have
ever watched any of bob ross's uh shows
you know he always makes the comment of
like nature doesn't run in straight
lines right so
when we say something is linear it's
conceptually linear it's not literally
linear right because that's that's not a
sustainable program at that point right
where
one thing always goes up it just cannot
there's a breaking point whether it's
volume intensity
duration like it doesn't matter so um
just keep that in mind all of those
things are meant to just um
be progressive like dr mike said and i
think they're called linear for the sake
of conceptualizing them to a large
audience yeah
some dude norris is up next
ah
[Music]
all right he says okay doc i finally
thought of a question that isn't just
answered by sfr
when i ask it in my head are you good
james i'm still
control effing my way through i'll find
it
where are you some dude dildo
oh it's sum ah
psalm 41 there we go
[Music]
okay docs i finally thought of a
question that isn't just answered by sfr
when i ask it in my head fundamentally
has to do with the part of the
motorcycle progression debate
i was thinking about starting strength
and
thought that the best i guess the
starting strengths program we'll see you
guys
program that's right i thought the best
way to describe it would be to say each
lift has its own progression slash
microcycle length
since it has progressed within the week
so my question is what is the merit of
using microcycle lengths other than one
week
in order to match or close closer match
the rate of adaptation
that's my question i'll write a bunch of
spillover thoughts mostly reasons why it
might not work in the comments you're
welcome to read them or not also for
everyone feel free to throw in your two
cents so
uh in the comments he actually doesn't
say much more he says some big cons too
much longer micro second links like two
weeks or something
said accumulated fatigue might catch up
to you before we really pick up steam
during meso
it would take like four weeks to add two
reps to every
lift another con to longer for mouth
cycles is that they require the use of
more variation
good point shorter amount of second
lengths would have less variation but
result in more repetitive joint
connective shoot damage also very good
point
i think these are worth consideration
but not necessarily damning since
decisions are made at the margin i love
the decisions made at the margin part
here let me give you my take here
microcycle
design is interesting of how long a
micro cycle is but you have to look at
the details of the microcycle
if my microcycle is squat squat squat
monday wednesday friday
you can say it's a one-week microcycle
but it's really a two-day microcycle in
some big sense because you fucking just
watch my squat
and how you progress loads and volumes
and intensities and when you recycle
to the same set rep etc scheme can be
multiple times a week or it can be once
a week and
how much progression you make can also
be adjusted so let's say you only squat
once every two weeks maybe you can put
10 pounds on the bar each time
but if you squat once a week maybe you
put five pounds on the barge time and
then the sra dynamics cancel out
they because you're just adjusting how
much you're doing so if anyone tells you
of the following microcycle length
you could adjust the contents of the
microcycle to really adapt
quite well to a variety of links and
here's what this comes down to
is fundamentally if james and i had to
have sort of a gun to our head
the ultimate microcycle length might be
something like four days
like uh kind of a push a legs a pull
throw some other smaller
muscle groups in there have one day like
a half day of rest yeah yeah
exactly and then again right it look but
here's the thing
that also is interesting i i used to for
years
i trained on a five day microcycle but
what it ended up doing
is like sometimes it's sunday and you're
doing legs sometimes
it's tuesday and you're doing legs and
yes
what ends up happening is like you can't
have as reliable of a schedule
um sometimes the gyms are weird hours
sometimes there's different people using
different machines
so for example like sometimes when you
train a really big body part or really
small one or something or one that's
really
uh tough to train you either wake up and
you prefer to have like at least two
meals in you before you go
or you're really vomiting you prefer no
meals at all well like let's say you
train legs
on saturday waking up and just going to
train likes is the easiest thing in the
world
but let's say you train legs now lex is
on a thursday but like you have
advanced statistics class in your
master's program at 7 00 am
so you can't just like wake up at 5 30
not eat anything sit through the whole
class
basically pass out from hypoglycemia and
then go at 9 30 and go fucking hit a
training session you're going to have to
eat
and then you're going to be god damn it
i have to train legs but if you just
look at your week
because the human calendar repeats every
week you can put workouts in the best
possible places relative to the rest of
your schedule
and it solves a ton of problems it's
super simple it's super easy here's
another one real quick while i'm
on the thought there's machines you
really like to use so for example if you
have a hack squat or a squat setup or a
power lifter
you need your setup at your gym to get
the best results so maybe you train
monday tuesday
thursday friday or something like that
because you know you're at home now on a
weekend you might go with your
girlfriend or wife or boyfriend or
whatever
like to the shore and have a good time
and if it's biceps and chest you can
just go to a fucking
gym and just fucking blast it whatever
but like if it's your maximum effort
squat day
you're not going to some random gym in
new jersey and doing that shit you might
not find a rack
it might be a weird mirror in front of
your act you fucking hate the mirror
because you know what i mean like
irregularity is really good which is why
a seven-day microcycle is not ideal but
it's good enough
and because it comports with a human
schedule it wins
a lot james yeah or the fact that you
are in new jersey just catches up to you
and crushes damn it
damn it yeah the thing is like
consistency overrides everything
in this case even optimality in many
instances so the
ability to track things and adjust
accordingly the auto regulation factor
really just negates the idea of trying
to optimize
like things down to such a nitty-gritty
level because you can always adjust
right and other sports and activities
like track and field is kind of renowned
for having unusual micro cycle programs
like they'll do like nine days
um do you need to do that no can you do
that yes
might it actually be better on an
individual basis to do that to some
extent
maybe maybe there might i could see
instances where
at least some of the time that might be
better but i think more often than not
most of the time because
everyone operates on the the normal
weekly monthly schedule
falling in line with that allows you to
have the most consistent and predictable
training outcomes which allows you to
track and auto regulate the most
effectively and if you can do that
you basically can wipe out any issues
that you have that come up so
how can you auto regulate if like if
your
if your training conditions are so
vastly different like dr mike described
or some days you have the squat rack all
to yourself you go when you want other
times you have school you have life you
have family maybe your dogs
continue to shit in the nice house that
you bought with your wife and it drives
you insane
you know oddly specific oddly specific
oh i can't wait to see oh
i don't want to go down this road mike
sorry but it kind of fits in
how many people are going to be like so
and so won the election
i'm not training today too stressed
go train it'll de-stress you joe rogan
had great advice on his instead he's
like go train go train
it'll feel great just go do it i have to
admit i
it's stupid of me but i can't help but
check my phone
every so often to see what the live
updates are because some states have
been going like blue and red back and
forth sometimes the margins like big and
small
it's fun to watch i don't know it's
interesting it's fun
yeah folks stay calm keep training
all righty next up
kiara m c i a r
n kieran that's probably
got it all right he says hi docs i was
wondering what your opinion was on
isometric exercises like farmer's walks
and suitcase carry static holes and
dragon flags
i enjoy these exercises but i've heard
some people say that isometrics don't
build muscle and i would like to know if
i'm wasting my time by doing them so
there's a couple of animal models in
which they tested isometrics versus
concentric versus eccentrics and what
they found
is there's some unique hypertrophy is
activated by all three of those
so the ultimate training program
probably stimulates all three and a lot
of times isometrics get taken care of by
pauses and stuff like that between your
lifts or
under heavy load like if you pause at
the bottom of the bench it takes care of
that pretty well
isometrics just by themselves
when you do a movement and you only do
the asymmetric component like a farmer's
walk
especially when coming with a high
degree of axial loading
like loading through the spine they're
pretty hypertrophic the problem is the
fatigue they generate especially
systemic is
really big and the stimulus to fatigue
ratio ends up not being that great
so for example if you ask uh
how do i put this politely regular
fitness gym bros that are just getting
into exercise and really pumped about it
and reading all kinds of books and
puzzle tuts lean shit
they'll be like oh my god the best way
to build traps
is farmers walks and and carries loaded
carries looks trauma they have few traps
and they're like
they've hacked the system they look at
almost all the best bodybuilders they
never ever fucking ever do that shit in
a million years
how do they build traps one is they
usually a lot of times they don't even
train traps by themselves because traps
get so much work from dealt and back
work and even lego work when you just
still fucking deadlifts and stuff like
that
but also when they do train traps a lot
of times shrugs it's just dumbbell
shrugs and sometimes barbell shrugs a
lot of time machine and cable shrugs
because at the end of the day if you
stand in place you don't have to
generate the fatigue of moving around or
the injury risk so
there's better also if you do the
concentric eccentric and isometric
you get a ball or stimulus without
having to use nearly as much weight as
an eccentric only lift
so if you really have to come down to it
are
these muscles are these uh isometrics oh
pretty good at building muscle yeah
very good at building muscle is it worth
the fatigue if you're fatigue
constrained
fuck no almost no cases so if you've got
serious aspirations to be a hypertrophy
uh triathlete physique athlete maybe
you're getting ready for a show or
getting serious on your uh getting
serious on your muscle gain phase
and you asked james and i like hey can i
can i do like farmer's watch should i do
farmer's walks we're gonna be like dude
save that shit for cardio and for not
dying don't fucking do it but if you're
like
a person who just likes to work out you
like being jacked and you don't really
have a realistic fatigue constraint nor
any like really intense goals like if
you're building your own airplane
and you want to put a mini bar in it
nobody's going to be like you're an
idiot but you're fine it's your airplane
leisure go swim around if you're
building a stealth bomber you put a mini
bar in it people can be we see the
mission is constrained to this
and you're putting in shit that doesn't
make any goddamn sense so if you're
mission constrained
don't do these things unless you're a
strong man uh
and but if you're not mission
constrained if you have plenty of
fatigue you just like to have fun and
get big traps fucking do them enjoy them
they're great
i think you guys caught dr mike on a
good day because i think on
a different day he would have been like
that's fucking stupid stupid fucking
idiot
asshole uh so i'm gonna go that route
today i think those are um
i think dr mike's his point is well
received they uh those things can't
isometrics can be a good stimulus to a
point and that's usually kind of
once you hit that late beginner early
intermediate stage where they really
just don't do much for you anymore
i think for our conversation purposes
we're usually talking about people who
are at least intermediate and beyond
and i think for those people doing
things like farmer's walks and static
holes are largely just a huge waste of
time
whatever you're getting out of it you're
paying a much huger cost and that's what
dr mike was saying about the sfr ratio
um some of the like the dragon flag is
one that you can actually do
as a full movement some people call it a
candlestick some people call it a
dragonflag you can actually do that one
as a full
full round movement um you do get a lot
of
benefit indirectly from some isometric
training for example like when you do
squats and deadlifts you actually train
quite a bit of your midsection largely
isometrically not totally isometrically
but largely isometrically
so there are some big benefits to doing
that but for the most part like if if
if you had you know somebody who was an
aspiring bodybuilder they were maybe
like a late intermediate and they were
like i need my abs to be bigger and pop
more should i just stick with these
isometrics from the squats and stuff and
say yeah maybe you probably should do
some more direct ab training at some
point probably in your benefit if it was
like a lagging muscle group
um so i think don't waste your time with
that stuff this is where
there's kind of like a weird
intersection whereas people want
to be jacked but they also don't want to
let go of the idea of feeling athletic
or
doing fun novel things right and those
other two like the latter two of like
feeling athletic and doing fun novel
things that's fine we've all been there
i experience it all the time you're like
why all my whole life is just picking
things up and putting things down isn't
there more
existential crisis right you want but
you just gotta settle in and just say
like if i want to be the most jacked guy
that i can be
probably picking things up and putting
them down in a controlled way it's
probably the best way to go about it
if i want to be like a montana mountain
man yeah
i can do plenty of log carries and
farmers walks and pick up shit around my
yard and that would probably enhance my
quality of life in some ways but it's
probably not going to help make me
more jacked yeah perfect
next up our great friend from lithuania
mantas philippe witches he always has a
whole bunch of your questions mantis
gets upvoted man this motherfucker
he asked a question which we are going
to unleash cunt james on
and i'll unleash cunt mic on it first
montas you know
you are boy nothing's personal we're
just having some fun
um always have the best questions so
let's get into it
what numbers do you think most people
are capable to achieve on squat
mentioned deadlift
would that be close to those of an
average power lifter so i'll say a
couple of things
i have a lot of thoughts here i know see
james is already pissed so
we i'm gonna give you the answer a
question with a question thing because
you know what do pseudo-intellectuals
like me do is
that shit like that right so first of
all we got to define what you mean most
do you mean males or females i know cop
out you almost certainly need males but
when you say most do you mean most
people in the world most people of young
adult age most people who train for 10
years in their young adult years
properly or remotely properly or do you
mean most
like human males on planet earth do you
mean all of the
different races and sub-races of people
or do you mean mostly caucasians and
people of west africa and asian ancestry
residing in europe and north america
cause like
look this you're probably european and
we're north american
and like that's how we think about
people you know if i took you to like
some fucking tiny little village in
ecuador some shit where everyone's four
foot two
like a 95 pound bench press would be the
fucking world record or some shit
you would be like what but these people
are so tiny like not everyone's brian
shaw right this huge genetic diversity
so you know and then if i took you to
nigeria you know the average lifting
numbers after proper training would be
some shit that you were like is this u.s
is this usap all nationals the fuck is
going on right so
how about your variation harrisburg
pennsylvania
exactly just like people
white people with nothing to live for
except iron steel it's great
so uh so here's the deal i will give you
i will however give you
uh an answer um and first is there's a
second party question would be close to
those of an average power lifter no
be considerably far behind and i'll give
you the answer and i'll tell you why
but i'll do it reverse order why
powerlifter average powerlifter is a
huge selection effect
a lot of people try powerlifting and
after six months the ones with very
little talent for it usually just move
on to some other shit
almost all power lifters who compete um
are pretty fucking good compared to
regular people you may think you may see
a guy bench press 315 at a meet weighing
220
and you're like really you're competing
with 15 bench when you weigh 220
and you think like okay that's not
competitive power lifter standard you
know
220 if you're benching anything under
400 you're not really in the
conversation about like wow you're
really strong
in a power lifting circle but like how
many guys at your gym bench press 315
three and a three or two of them weigh
260
and it's you've got one guy there that
can do that like it's really exceptional
so um what numbers do you think most
people are capable of achieving and
squatting so
i'm going to assume this is with several
years of training not like 10 in a
decent effort i'm going to take this is
the average
earth male of average earth meal body
weight and
one of the ways i noticed i've trained
to shit a lot of people in person i've
trained a ton of people in new york's
financial
district um people of all races ages etc
and what i found is going to be kind of
interesting okay
i think that many people probably most
of like a guy who weighs 150 to 165
who's in his 30s with several years of
dedicated training
can squat over 225 can
bench over 185 just over 185
and can pull three plates most people
most males can probably work up to that
after several years of dedicated
training with an average body weight
that's not that high so average power
lifter fucking not even close
you guys have to understand the
following youtube and instagram and your
own gym
perverts our idea of what is normal
somebody squatting a male an adult human
squatting 315 he's a fucking really
strong person
now oh sure he's not james often
squatting four or five for reps but
james hoffman would say themselves an
awful example
no right but i was unfortunate because
james it just
castigated me for me james doesn't think
he's strong right but like compared to
the average
male james is so fucking strong and i'm
like inexplicable
and like you know or one of the little
bridges is like god among men
but we all think like oh little bridge
only squatted 850 at this meet that's
pedestrian like
what right so yeah if you squat 225 as
an adult male after several years
you're doing real well for yourself look
around your gym
how many of these motherfuckers that
train squat 225 to depth
that weigh under 180 pounds it's not
that many
because most of them don't train it but
if they did i think the 225 185
3 15-ish 300 pounds i think is
attainable for most people i would say
this
if you weigh between 150 and 175 and
you're an adult male and you have plenty
of food and you're in your 20s or 30s
and you've trained for
several years two to four years and you
haven't squatted 225 bench 185
and pulled roughly 300 your genetics
probably suck if you're assuming you're
doing things decently like
you just have shitty genetics and most
people could do what you do
james that was interesting so like yeah
i have a hard time because like you said
the selection bias problem where uh
you're looking at people you generally
will look at people
in the exercise realm of things whether
they're power lifters or people who are
just in fitness
right but what the reality is is like
especially like here in north america i
know other places don't have the same
problem that we do
but most people are fat and like way too
fat like way
fat diabetic fat cardiovascular disease
fat
so you ask somebody like what do you
think they can do like homie they're
gonna that
they're trying not to die at this point
like bench 185 get the fuck out of here
right
so it's kind of hard for me to put
numbers on that i think
i don't know i kind of feel like i don't
think you're wrong but i feel like those
were ambitious numbers when you think
about like the average walmart person
right this person you see
on a fucking scooter assuming they got
their shit together oh
right for sure but then like you know
i'll put this way there's tons of
healthy people walking around in china
and you get these chinese motherfuckers
lifting they sprout like motherfucker
you know like so
yeah i think it kind of matched up at
birth too right
like i said it's right for sure a male
between
150 and 175 pounds youngish healthy like
that's what
anything most people that's what i'm
restricting to yeah james
totally agreed most people human people
oh my fucking god like a third of them
are children they can't fucking do that
you know so totally totally but yeah
it's hard to say if you and i are on the
same spectrum of like it's not nearly as
impressive as you think
totally i totally agree with that yeah
and it's maybe mom just next time if you
want to maybe reform that question
because that one was really broad
and i appreciate what you were getting
at but it's like mike said it's hard to
answer that because there's so much
difference
right you have imagine like the like uh
even
even within like athletic populations
you might have somebody like lebron
james like
who's really great at basketball do you
think he's benching like 400
500 pounds like probably not he's like a
superstar athlete though so what does
that mean it's like ah it doesn't matter
because it's called contextual it's all
like
you could ask the same question of like
could the average person
do do create a painting that's just as
good as like a professional painter
like i don't know just the average
run-of-the-mill professional who gets
contracted to paint like the inside of
an office building
like the answer is by fuck no probably
not yeah it's it's a
it's a contextual thing like there's so
many things that go into it interest
skill level
uh it's hard to answer so i like the
question but i can't give
a better answer than mike did
pico rodriguez our man pico is up again
here you go oh are you gonna watch
contender series tonight
uh i didn't wasn't planning on i don't
even know what that is
oh is that like ufc thing yeah it's like
the uh
in lieu of the ultimate fighter they
have this other feeder show that's cool
yeah i gotta start getting into that
shit is there anyone good really
interesting
uh they're all kind of have their own
little back stories interesting but
they're all like
they're like they're people kind of like
like will like they're they're like
doing really well on the regional
circuit trying to get up into like
the the big make sense will is going to
be fighting on tv in a few weeks
i know he's fighting an lfa that's a big
deal that's crazy that's a real big deal
yeah all right pico says from what i
understand
better pumps disruption slash soreness
and my muscle connection mean a better
stimulus for hypertrophy
i get all those things when resting
one minute and not two to three minutes
especially with single joint exercises
why is that and why are we recommending
rest two to three minutes between sets
if one minute gives me better indicators
of spurious stimulus so
i'm not sure who exactly is recommending
two to three minutes of rest i certainly
uh the four the four part rest guideline
that we've published
at rp is i think a lot better if you're
really good to go and everything's
recovered and you hit it again
um be careful about
what you conclude as disruption and
soreness because if you get really
really fatigued then do you actually get
more doms later
does the muscle experience a much more
profound disruption later
sometimes resting longer between sets
like resting shorter you feel fucked up
but then 15 minutes later you hop skip
out of the gym you feel fine
but if you take your time between sets
you hit the deep fast wish muscle fibers
then you're like oh my god i'm really
really really fucked up but at the end
of the day
for some single joint exercises for some
muscle groups
resting two or three minutes like you
kind of lose your pump and metabolite
sequestration might not occur
anymore muscle activation might kind of
decline because you're sort of resting
so long that your muscles are like i
guess we're cool now we're not doing
this anymore
which is why rest time should always be
individualized and that's sometimes yeah
for some people one minute
is if it gives you better indications of
stimulus don't over value the pump over
everything else remember it's all in
context
and how much tension you're able to
generate so if you get a really ball or
pump
but you've done like half of the
mechanical work especially you know
your sets have been cut in half reps
wise even if a ball or pump you got to
be like all right i've been doing a lot
less work and i know mechanical tension
like force induced via work is a real
big thing that's got to be a part of it
too
so but the proxy variables absolutely
matter
and if you get them really well and you
can get in a ton of mechanical tension
better at one minute rest than two to
three there's a good chance you're
either gonna be growing the same from
one or two to three except faster
like or as to say more efficiently
because you don't have to spend hours at
the gym
or you may even grow better so uh yeah
that's the deal
yeah and so just piggybacking off to dr
mike's point sometimes taking short rest
can give you
what we would call a type one error
which is a false positive because
taking a short rest just is more prone
for you to have like a metabolite effect
where you just get like a really big
pump and a big burn and you're like oh
yeah i'm really feeling it now
yeah but you might as dr mike said you
might be doing a lot less work or a lot
less quality of work than you actually
think you are so sometimes taking the
short rest can be really good and really
beneficial and sometimes it can maybe
feel like it's doing something that it
actually is not
right so performance tracking is really
helpful in that case um
playing with different rest times but
you also just might be a more on the
slow torch side of things and you might
just recover really quickly in between
sets and you're good to go and actually
waiting two to three is actually like
mike said approaching that cooldown
period for you where it's like
i'm not doing anything time to go into
recovery right so if you find that like
maybe historically you have gravitated
towards more endurance type activities
then yeah that might
kind of at least partially confirm it
you're maybe on the more slow twitch
side of things and
maybe can just do less rest and be
totally fine you don't have to do two to
three minutes
i would say sorry yeah i've never been
back up a little bit okay
you know i would say if you're doing
compound movements such as squats like
presses bench presses things like that
and you are having the same result now i
know you said single joint so
i'm just reaching out to that next level
you said single joint
uh but if you're having that same
relationship on some of those other
movements and you're like one minute
rest is all i need
i would strongly kind of look at that
and say like okay something seems a
little funny like
any even if you're more slow twitch like
most people squats two to three minutes
pretty good rest longer to ski if your
performance really improves and that's a
really good thing
yeah if it's like one minute i would say
you're probably
whatever you're doing is under
stimulating in terms of either load or
sfr
or some combination of both
eruption 89. here's our next question
after sexual very sexual eruption 89.
eruption 89 says or asks rather
what is your current recommendation for
adjusting calories and massing
well can you still hear me james yep yep
sorry i hit something on my headphones
uh in the nutritional muscle gain
lectures you suggest using a band of
0.25
which is close enough for weekly changes
in bodyweight versus targeting
making 10 to 20 changes outside of that
however the rpdi 2.0 you describe the
process of waiting
for three weeks and then adjusting
calories precisely by subtracting the
observed weight
from the target weight and multiplying
by 300 and oh
3 500 divided by seven is one more
optimal this is a rule where
the theoretical optimality is completely
eclipsed by the real world applicability
and just eat a little bit more food to
keep gaining is the best answer that
works
um which one is more optimal is
difficult to decide one is a little
simpler than the other
so the stuff in the nutrition for muscle
gain is really simple if i had to try to
describe on video
the mathematical process that you read
in the rp die 2.0 book i would lose
almost everyone
including myself so if you really want
something that i can
put my money behind an app algorithm
perhaps
then the rp divorce 2.0 is the best
that's
optimal but you will find that in
practical purposes it almost never
deviates from
the recommendation i made for nutrition
for muscle gain lectures so
at the end of the day man what's going
to happen is your body is going to look
like this and you'll be like i think i'm
getting a little too slow and i'm going
to add like 250 calories
but that's really not how it goes
yeah and a lot of the questions of
optimality should
i think people often just neglect like
the lifestyle
factors that go into that like what is
optimal is like what you can do and do
well and do consistently right
there is like what is on pen and paper
maybe best practice
and then there is like kind of what is
most like realistic
expectation in the real world and then
somewhere in between there is like
what compromises are you willing to give
to have the best results
in both of those realms right and so
that's kind of like what optimal is it's
like
i have a lifestyle i have some realistic
limitations as to how much fuss i can
put into this but i want to get
incrementally better at tracking these
things
what is the kind of the intersection
there that is best for
me specifically that's what optimal is
yeah
oh it's one of my pet peeves is when
people like badger you about optimal and
you actually give them the time of day
and you
extensively give them the theoretical
trade-offs and then their next instagram
post is like eating a cookie and they're
like time to cheat and you're like
yeah yeah or or you you you give them
all the information they're like but
i've been doing it this way so i'm gonna
keep doing it like okay
great cool okay thanks for wasting both
of our times yep
all right our next question asker is
mike with the most amazing how he got
this name
one and only oh there's so many mics oh
i found it there it is boom that was
easy
mike asks the question we're going to
tear shreds mike we love you
we love you in advance and nothing
personal but here we go
roughly how many sets of rows will
equate to one set of devops rusty most
magnitude a couple of things
one depends on which muscle you're
talking about rosting most magnitude to
the upper traps middle traps lower traps
spinal erectors
rhomboids terra's major lats rear belts
glutes tons of muscles there that the
deadlift hits and the row hits so
it's gonna have to be a difference so
just to put it in
in perspective uh on average uh
just a raw super crazy raw average which
i will get to in a second is fucking
meaningless
um for something like mid traps it's
probably one to one
if not like actually one set of deadlift
is like 1.5 sets of rows
uh for something like lats it's like
seven to one
where you have to do seven sets of
deadlift to get one
rows worth of stimulus for the lats
because the lats are
very just static stabilizer pretty much
and uh maybe dynamic stabilizer
depending how you think of it in
deadlifts i would switch to stiff legged
deadlifts at that point that can be yeah
for sure like you know as long if you're
not like trying to really keep your arms
into your knees you're letting gravity
do that and
gee your lats are barely active and even
when they are it's like mostly isometric
so
that has to be considered but also at
the end of the day remember that
stimulus to fatigation and the raw
stimulus magnitude
how much tension you're perceiving how
much burn you're perceiving how much of
a pump you're getting and how much
disruption you get in the target muscle
x number of sets of deadlifts for you
will give you the same amount of raw
stimulus magnitude the average of all
three of those sub indices
as an x number of set of rows deadlifts
rose deadlifts
it's different for people some people do
a set of conventional deadlifts and
their whole back blows up
some people do a set of conventional
deadlifts and like they do a set of back
rows their whole back blows up so the
one person can be three to one in one
direction one person could be three to
one or more in the other direction so
mike at the end of the day
this is only dating you can get from
your own training so do
plenty deadlifts see how sore your back
gets in various places how big of a pump
etc and be like yeah you know four sets
of deadlifts really fucking
lights up my traps and then do bent rows
uh a mesocyclolate or something you know
it takes like six sets of that rose to
light up my traps like it does
uh four sets of deadlifts and then you
know there's a four six conversion for
the traps
and again this whole conversion bullshit
um
it doesn't fucking add up to shit you'll
never use any of these numbers get in
the gym
pick your exercises auto regulate to hit
the fucking ghetto
uh minimum effective volume landmarks
you know are you getting pumps are you
getting burns
are you getting tension are you getting
fucking disruption and soreness etc
and if you are start where it's low work
up to when it's high deload repeat
that's it
like and at the end of the day someone
asks you like hey we think of deadlifts
versus bent rows
why the fuck are they versus each other
whenever you start deadlifts make sure
you're doing enough of them to hit the
muscles
do a little bit more each time deload
try them again or switch to rows and
start again
now you'll know roughly how many to
start at
but you don't even have to know that
because set to set to set
so you have no idea how many barrels
it's going to take to blow up your traps
like deadlifts did because you haven't
done bent rows in years or ever
the thing is what tells you that is as
you do your first set of bent rows
your traps get a certain amount of pump
and someone just blow a lot or like you
know disruption
and then after another set they get a
certain amount of more disruption
and more pump and so on and so forth and
more tension perception
and more of a burn and at some point the
number of sets you do that gets you the
deadlift equivalent
can be just purely auto regulated you're
like all right three sets of rows and my
shit is fucked up i'm done
like you wouldn't be like well it should
be six to one and you do another six
sets
of bent rows and you can't move your
traps for a week right so it's it's all
auto regulation is something that really
beats the shit out of all this an
individualization capstone
so your question can't be reliably
answered because there's so many
different muscle groups involved
and it's going to change and it's going
to be super individual to you
yeah very good answer mike um so just
mike just i'll give you kind of the tldr
version of what mike said is um you know
for
from beginners you might actually see
you know like some kind of uh
calculation that you could
you could make in terms of like how many
deadlifts translate to
actual back training work but that's
nonsense because beginners just grow
from everything
and once you become an intermediate you
have to actually be doing direct muscle
training to really perpetuate any
further gains right
so at that point you can't be doing this
like halves these quarters ease seventh
disease bullshit in order to make gains
in muscle or if you do it's just such a
shitty trade-off that you never make any
progress right
so the idea here is like you train bent
rows
for your upper back muscles right at
that point you train deadlifts for like
your glutes
your legs and maybe to your spinal
erectors at some point they have a
distinct purpose rather than like a
broad overreaching purpose
uh you could if you haven't figured this
out you could kind of rephrase the
question and i think you'll see
our point is you could say roughly how
many
sets of rows translate to
uh sets of deadlifts for your glutes
you'd be like what
i mean but that's basically the same
question right where it's like
well it doesn't really train the glutes
all that well once you're kind of like
an intermediate
so why would you do it that way that
doesn't make sense same thing in the
other direction so
at that point once you're at that
intermediate stage or beyond you're not
really trying to just
calculate a whole bunch of partials and
summate them you're really trying to
stimulate
your muscles through direct training
methods as best you can and tracking
those numbers and
kind of the partials just kind of fall
wherever they do and just do your best
at managing them
last up king in the north oh game of
thrones
nope king in the north
got it all right oh my i see numbers
oh so many numbers oh
oh king of the north says studies show
that the average human
can't properly synthesize more than 40
grams of protein at once but this
conflicts a bit with your recommendation
of three to five meals for individuals
with high protein demands
so notice it doesn't conflict at all on
pure semantic rounds
because individual type protein demands
are not the average human
i could just stop answering this
question at this point and it would be
sufficient
yeah and just just king of the north
just fyi so like the 40 grams
roughly good guideline but we also know
that that is variable for
with different conditions like fasting
and stuff like that so
and that's for people that weigh like
165. exactly like muscle size
weight body weight bmi brian shaw can
synthesize a whole lot more protein and
process it properly than 40 fucking
grams per meal i can guarantee you that
so that's like a look at an elephant and
sink oh it's 20 grams per meal that's it
exactly so it's like a good rough rough
guideline but it's not an
end all be all by any means uh and then
he says
200 220 pro protein requires five to six
meals a day if they have to be capped at
40 grams of protein i'm comfortable
eating 50
to 70 grams of protein at once but i'm
curious
about whether or how much better i'm off
um forcing myself to eat five to six
less satisfying meals per day i'm also
pretty intermediate with potentially
potential just slowly grow
this concern as i add muscle of the year
so my recommendation of three to five
meals per day
is uh really just a very general
recommendation i've made
more recommendations for more serious
athletes that's uh in all the rp diet
books etc that's four to seven meals per
day
so all of a sudden that is closed i
think if you're making a very serious
run at maximum hypertrophy or maximum
muscle retention while fat loss is
occurring
anything less than four meals a day is
not a good idea brad schoenfeld's review
literature on that would agree as well
then he goes uh have there been any
studies done on an individual with a
higher demand for protein higher body
weight for martial protein maintain one
gram per pound can synthesize more
protein once to by the extent that i
know known
but we also know now from some really
good research it's just one study but
it's
very interesting that older individuals
can actually
make use of more protein at a time than
younger individuals like they can
actually
get an increase in muscle growth up to
70 grams of protein in this particular
study
versus younger individuals who capped
off between 40 and 50.
the absolute amount of muscle growth is
less than the older people
but it seems for them adding an extra
protein does actually help them with
younger people that's not the rate
limiting step
so uh there already we have uh
uh knowledge that in individuals that
are older more protein per meal can be
beneficial
and look i bet good fucking money the
gigantic fucking people that need 220
hundred
uh 200 to 220 grams of protein or people
like brian shaw size they need 400 a day
look he's not eating 25 gram protein
meals he's not an undergrad study he's
gonna need
more um so no there haven't been
intricate studies i just wouldn't bet
um the counter factual here and then he
says in addition to the higher body mass
taller individuals have longer digestive
systems
due to body proportioning and so that's
not always true
uh because a lot of times tall people
have shorter sitting heights relatively
and absolutely they're similar sitting
heights so for example james and i have
a very similar length
torso he just has longer legs than me um
you can also have more
uh some substances dissolved in the
blood at once uh
medical doctors told me it's an issue
with dosing some medications yeah so
like when you're brian shaw's size
like whatever 40 grams gets through
digestive system whenever it goes into
the muscle
sorry it goes in the bloodstream the
amino acid concentration in the
bloodstream
is not as high when brian shaw's
bloodstream is fucking enormous
40 grams of protein isn't going as far
he probably needs to eat 80 something
like that
and he said i have no idea if an order
of responsible protein synthesis would
be overwhelmed by receiving too much
protein once it's not overwhelmed but
just at some point your muscles aren't
um there's an organ responsible protein
synthesis that is muscle tissue locally
by the way
uh and yeah they can only take up so
much in you so much but that's highly
variable based on for example how much
muscle there is like i'll put you this
way
if you train only your balance yeah
right if you train only your biceps you
eat 30 grams of protein
that might maximize the hypertrophy at
your biceps because the amino acids go
into the blood the biceps are
particularly receptive because they just
trained and they absorb it
if you change your whole fucking body or
your quads and your chest at the same
time
that same 30 grams of protein ends up
being much it's like inviting five kids
to your five orphans to your house on
thanksgiving versus 15. if you have the
same amount of food the orphans don't
get as much food
like it's just it's just a pure fact of
just mathematics right so
yeah you do need to alter protein intake
based on your body size based on how
much
you're training so on and so forth and
know the human body can't absorb and
utilize in some of the situations much
more than 40 grams of protein
it's nice though that this like um the
meme of x grams of protein is up to 40.
it used to be people based on the old
studies remember dreams are coming up
for school 20 25 because it was not on
untrained
undergraduates uh it was like oh they're
anything more than 20. and
this is the absolute absolute worst part
of exercise versus sports science and
abuse
of exercise science was you had exercise
scientists phd is saying
yeah anything more than 20 grams of
protein is just a stupid idea
because insert study i'm like you
untrained
fucking hack shut the fuck up you're
insulting our whole field
this is why bros don't take you
seriously because you see wrong shit
based on undergrads and think it
external validity is just gone
so anyway pet peeve but yeah no you can
absorb and can utilize more protein
under certain circumstances and yes
eating four plus meals a day
is probably better for optimality
optimality than eating three meals a
days
yeah i absolutely agree and again just
keep in mind king of the north this is
still like a contentious area of
research we're actually not
entirely sure so people have produced
different numbers as mike said it used
to be like 20 25.
now we're seeing some up to 40 but we
also know that there's different factors
at play we know that things like
when the last how many times you eat per
day seems to play a role how the
distance between those meals which kind
of ties into meal frequency as well
the size of the individual seems to at
least
anecdotally play a role muscle mass
things like that so
it's not necessarily a cut and dry thing
where we just say this is the hard cap
it's something where we we use the
general recommendations of like try and
get roughly you know one ish gram per
pound per day split into however many
meals
suits your fancy and go from there and
that's probably pretty spot on
and maybe it's a bit of an overestimate
but the good news is even if it is an
overestimate
it's not like that protein is poisoning
you in any way right most of it just
gets
processed to other bodily functions or
gets excreted out in your poop done
no big deal yep yep uh that's 100
and also a lot of times just gets burned
off for energy and we already know you
can't really get poisoned from protein
unless you have some weird fucked up
kidney thing
so if you eat a little bit more just air
on the side of a little tiny bit more
you're good to go yeah was that the last
one
that was it man oh my goodness all right
folks
thank you so much for all the questions
dr mike got anything for us before we
sign off
i think uh i think that's about it we
got all kinds of fun videos in the
pipeline so stay tuned
all right guys make sure you subscribe
oh uh nick shaw's book i think was
released or is
god gonna be gonna gotta be so close so
close
i've been getting like the amazon
notification so i suspected it was
released but it must be like it must be
right on the rig
i link i'll link the fuck out of it when
it gets released i'm sure you want to
yeah i definitely will so guys stay
tuned for that i
got my first round of feedback from dr
jake reed on the book that i'm working
on so i'm going to work on integrating
his comments and moving on from there
that's all i got so folks make sure you
subscribe
we'll see you next time thanks for
submitting those great questions we will
talk to you later
peace
