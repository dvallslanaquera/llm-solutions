hey folks dr michael retalia for
renaissance periodization using
performance to regulate your training
volume
we already know how to do it from two
weeks ago's videos of using the pump
we know how to do it from last week's
video of using muscle disruption
now exercise performance and its ability
to help us auto regulate volume
so i'm going to talk about what within
accumulation phase performances
and why we should care a little bit
technical we'll explain why we're going
to talk about using performance as a
partial tool to inform volume
manipulations and of course
we're going to use performance to
actually auto regulate volume
raising or lowering the amount of
training we're doing week to week to
week to make sure we get our best
hypertrophy
outcomes so here's the deal what the
hell is within accumulation performance
why do we care
accumulation phase is week one all the
way to whatever week four
six eight whatever before your deload
okay
the change in performance how many sets
or so how many reps
and loads you're getting per set is that
performance change within the
accumulation so like week one compared
to week two do we three week four week
five etc
not between mesoaccumulation or sorry
between meso performance which is like
okay
my pr and this mesocycle was this and
then d load in the next mesocycle what's
my pr
that's different so here we're talking
about just within a single accumulation
phase
how does our performance essentially our
rep strength how does our rep strength
change throughout and how quickly it
changes how it changes can help us
inform
what we should do with our training
volume now the performance
is complex because at least two factors
feed into how you perform every single
time one
is of course fitness which means maybe
your muscle size is increasing
it should be so you're getting higher
performances from that maybe you're
metabolically getting better at doing
the lift
and you know there's more oxygen or
wastes are leaving faster you can get
more reps that way a little bit more
load same reps
and of course neural and technical
abilities like your nervous system can
be
really figuring out how to do the lift
your technique improves all of a sudden
your performance is going up
that's what makes performance go up what
leads performance to go down or pulls it
down or from any one
point is fatigue that accumulates
throughout the mesocycle eventually to
unsustainable levels but yeah you get
tired too not all that tiredness goes
away by the next session
so while you are getting better fatigue
is pulling you down in
between those two factors is how
performance is determined
now ideally in an intelligently designed
program
you want to scale performance to reps in
reserve so each week
when you start with roughly three reps
in reserve each week you should have a
rough
reps in reserve goal so for example just
as
an example you can you know week one is
three reps in reserve goal
week two is two reps in reserve then one
rep then zero then deload
or you can stretch them out more and
have three three so week one and week
two or both three
week three and week four both two and
then two weeks or one two weeks or zero
and then you de-load something like that
but just generally it should progress
from three all the way to zero okay and
during that time each week you should
have kind of a pre-planned
goal of how many reps or how much weight
to add every single session or every
single week rather
so you say okay i'm gonna go from three
or zero ir
and during that time i'm gonna add like
five pounds every time or a rep every
time or two and a half pounds plus or up
so on and so forth right
the ultimate goal of a really solid
accumulation phase a real
messi cycle you look back on you're like
man i did great
is you hit your maximum recoverable
volume
right you're up to your volumes you
can't possibly sustain
and the same week in which you also plan
to hit your
zero rar lift so not only do you go all
the way to failure
but you do it with such high volume that
next week you can't repeat it because it
can easily be the other way around where
you can go to failure for like three
weeks in a row
and still not hit your mrv if your
volume is low enough so you can still
match the same performance
or even increase your performance
ideally what we want is that same week
to be the end week which means you're at
your mrv and zero
are at the same time peak week it's a
terrible time but it lets you know you
put everything you possibly could into
your hypertrophy training
deload because you deserve it and you
need it and then you restart the
progression again so
this is the universe in which we're
going to be speaking about how to track
performance
given that we're doing all this
we have to consider you know how we're
going to change volume
right so why do we care
why do we care about this if you add
volume
way too quickly you're going to reach
your mrv
way before you are attempting to do it
right if you don't increase your volume
quickly enough
you can go weeks and weeks training all
the way to failure which is probably
suboptimal with stimulus to fatigue
ratio
but not hit your mrv because you're just
training too little
right in order to stay on track and have
the best mezzo possible
you want some kind of intermediate level
of volume adjustment so that your volume
isn't too high it's not too low
it's slowly rising and then it peaks at
the same time as you get
zero reps in reserve and you've had a
nice long time
at least three weeks possibly more like
four or more
to train consecutively right so that's
the deal
now this performance so we're going to
be tracking performance and trying to
change volume based on how we perform
every session
it's not a complete tool there's lots of
erroneous stuff that can happen here
it's only a partial tool it can't tell
you for sure
if you're stimulating muscle growth it
can't tell you how much muscle growth
and other signs have to be used
like the pump or like disruption but it
can be an important indicator
let's find out how it works the
two things we need for this to work is
set quality you have to have good
technique
and you have to be pushing it hard if
you're not doing that then how the hell
can you tell
if you're supposed to be adding volume
or subtracting it or maybe just focusing
on better set quality
can leave you you know with half the
volume that you should have planned
before
right four amazing sets of leg press can
be the same hypertrophic stimulus as
eight shitty sets of leg press
you don't wanna be doing eight sets and
be like i guess i gotta do 10 next week
because i barely got sore my performance
is really
way too easy you don't want to do that
so quality first
and minimal load progression has to be
in place or rep progression
or both which is to say the goal should
be
to add at least like one rep every
session or some load to the working sets
or some combination of both every single
week so you have to be pushing it the
entire time
if that's the case how do we auto
regulate performance
uh or sorry auto regulate volume based
on performance
okay if in order to have
a challenging workout sufficiently
challenging
from one week to another in another way
in other words in order to hit your
rough
rir target you need to increase the
amount of load or the amount of reps by
a ton
one thing we can tell is that you
probably didn't accumulate a whole lot
of fatigue in the week before
which is another way of saying there's a
chance your volume was too low
so let's say you normally train with
like five or six sets
of a shoulder press you do two sets of
shoulder press in the first week or
let's say one
and then next week you've got to like
add way more weight to the bar or more
reps than you were expecting
because otherwise it's just not anywhere
close they are it's not challenging
well it's not challenging because one
fucking set didn't hardly do shit it
didn't make you fatigued at all
that's good but also it's just one set
so it probably
didn't cost a lot of hypertrophy if you
want to like hit many pr's week after
week after week and have them be
meaningless
and cause you some good neural gains but
no actual size gains just keep the
volume super low that's how power
lifters train and they're super fucking
strong for their size
but there's a reason they're not the
most jacked people in the world and if
they want to become
the most jack people when powerless
transition to bodybuilders they do more
volume
which makes them tired more often which
means they can't hit these crazy pr's
all the time
but they can hit the small ones and get
amazing work because the volume's high
enough so if you're way over performing
week to week to week in other words if
like this week is way
you hit all your targets way too easy or
in order for you to actually hit your
targets
successfully you have to put way more
weight or do more way more reps
you can be not positive but you can at
least suspect
that the week before you fucking didn't
do enough right your fatigue is not high
enough and that's why that's happened
if performance is on track okay the reps
in reserve
you plan to load progression and
reprogression you hit exactly the rar
that you probably thought you wanted so
for example
first week is three r you do a good
amount of volume next week you do same
amount of volume or maybe a little more
or something
and you do one rep more on each set and
five times more in each set and you hit
exactly like
we're somewhere between two and three r
you're fucking golden
don't touch anything that's probably the
same amount of volume is going to do
good you may under some conditions
be able to increase the volume just a
little bit by one set but not by much
because you're on track don't break the
shit that works you're on track it's all
going really well
on the other hand if
you have to violate your rar goal in
order to match your numbers
okay and we do nrp recommend
that you stick to your number so like if
you squat at 200 for sets of 10 last
week
this week is 205 for sets of 10 or sets
of 11 or whatever you had planned
don't just like make it easier because
no i have to hit r2 rar is real tough to
guess
but plan progressions are really easy to
follow follow your plan progression
and if following it you know your rer is
lower than it was supposed to be
man that means up to that point you've
had a lot of volume
and probably the week before was a fuck
load of volume it fatigued you
and it made that goal harder to reach
than it should have been
a lot of other stuff can be wrong which
is why this is only a partial tool
but if you have a week in which you
barely struggle to hit your numbers and
like you kind of hit them but your rirs
were a little lower than you wanted and
you've got more weeks of training to do
almost certainly do not increase the
volume either keep the volume the same
or potentially reduce it a little bit
lastly
if you actually reach failure and
underperform so for example
you did a 100 pounds for 10 reps last
week but a fuck load of sets of 10.
you get so fatigued that this week at
105 pounds i mean you're expecting for
equivalency
at least nine reps you get seven reps
at 105 and then the bar falls on you and
you're like fuck that's it that's
failure
right if you truly underperform you're
pretty much
at by definition at mrv and especially
if that repeats in another session later
in the week
you need to execute some sort of
recovery strategy asap that may be a
recovery session
recovery half week and if you if you
youtube google all these that we've got
videos on them
um or a deload okay that means you just
pushed it way too hard
here's the fucked up thing about fatigue
it accumulates and once it's there
you just gotta deal with it right making
a mess is a lot easier than cleaning up
the mess
so volume progressions should by
definition almost be conservative
like if you think you can go up by two
sets but maybe one just go up by one
because if you get into this situation
uh for point d here
and it's too much man you can't just be
like i'll just do less volume next week
well no you're already over
mrv your fatigue is sky high next week
you won't hit a pr
then after that you won't hit a pr
you're just in the shitty dead zone of
being way too tired to do anything
you have to back away you have to deload
which takes time away from super
productive
maximally productive hypertrophy
training so if you're a point a
not bad but you need to up the ante
probably do a little more volume next
week
if you're at point b fucking golden
don't touch anything if you're at point
c
you really sleep a ton really eat super
well this next week
definitely don't increase your volume
and potentially when you're increasing
your load or reps increase them very
little next week because you're on that
fine line you're on that edge and maybe
consider actually reducing your volume a
little bit
so that you don't wash yourself and
fatigue too soon so for example
if you reach point c and it's week
number two and you want to go for four
weeks
you don't just have to think about week
three you have to think about week four
two
so if you did six sets of let's say
curls and now you're at point c
in week three so in week three is you
did six sets of curls in week two
and now it's week three how many sets
should you do like if you do six
you may actually overreach right there
and then week four is a fucking wash
because you won't be able to hit your
performance goals
so maybe yeah if you eat a lot of sleep
a lot whatever and really not up you can
do six definitely don't do seven or
eight sets
but there's some logic to doing like
four or five
you do four or five and week three and
then you get good good uh prs
you you break your records on how many
reps you did or how much weight or both
and then week four you go back up to six
and then
really spill it because it doesn't
matter weak force last week anyway so
again playing the conservative game
almost always pays off right
that's it for using performance again
just very general and mostly works at
the extremes
in the next video we'll talk about how
to combine pump
disruption and performance indicators to
start now really painting a much clearer
picture of your training volume
and really helping you make much better
decisions about whether to stay the
course
in number of sets you do next week
increase or decrease
see you next time
