dude unreal celebrities take
[Music]
note hey folks Dr Mike here for RP
strength I've been a professor of sport
and action science for some time I'm a
competitive bodybuilder and Brazilian
jutu Grappler and I've been well talking
smack about other people's workout
routines for quite some time on this
channel we've had a lot of big names
pass through but there is only one big
name that we really never got a chance
to critique it's the biggest name of
them all that's right you the viewer our
wonderful audience we asked you answered
you submitted a ton of videos of your
lifting and now we're going to critique
you guys it's just viewers that
submitted their videos some of these
should be interesting some of them
should be fun some of them should be
terribly atrocious and here comes my
Preamble it's all jokes all the way down
the line so don't you go getting
offended all for the laws and if you get
offended I don't know do we have a legal
department Scotts video guy I'm sure we
do JK all freedom of speech anyway let's
see if we can uh get some good critiques
going I'll try to get a little bit of
information and confirm what is good uh
critique what maybe can be improved and
again it's all jokes so when I start
talking that it's all fun you're in
on the joke 3 two one
action
ah okay so the first thing I can tell is
the feet are not planted on the ground
and that means that overall force Power
production and motor unit muscle
recruitment is going to be substantially
lower than it could be which means if uh
this fine gentleman and look a little
closer had his feet planted then he
would probably be get better getting
better results now he may be suffering
from a terrible syndrome that afflicts
afflicts even folks such as myself short
King disease many times my little tiny D
dangly feet uh don't even reach uh the
bottom of the the floor from the bench
and then you just kind of had to do what
you got to do but if you can tuck them
under the bench if you can solidify your
feet in any kind of way that's going to
be really good also you guys probably
knew this already but right now I sit in
this chair my feet are not touching the
ground and you know what it feels like
it feels Grand I'm like Peter Pan except
I'm also not around to be no yeah Peter
Pan wasn't allowed to be around children
I don't think um what a weird guy he's a
chronologically 40 but still 10 I look
like I'm 80 but I'm the height of a
10-year-old anyway let's see what else
is going on here full range of motion
ental
control chest stays nice and high I
can't that the legs are so distracting
they're just doing the dangling uh and
they're doing the dangling cuz they're
adjusting for body position but
unfortunately that means you're losing
some power production and some uh
decreased ability to contract all of the
muscles and thus you do miss out on some
hypertrophy leaving your legs up like
that if you ever see someone bench
pressing with their knees in the air
it's not the best way to train but the
rest of this movement gets very very
high
marks
Scott what is this okay so at this point
I'm just hoping he doesn't get hurt or
if he's real serious about this I'm
really hoping he gets hurt so we got a
unicycle is that what you call it yeah I
actually have a patent for unicycle that
has no
seat but it does have a handle that goes
up a variety of attachable inserts are
purchasable for an extra charge the
unicycle that you can really connect
with I mean like this
is dumber than when I was a kid just
stupid as rocks thing to do point one
point two this is impressive as if I
tried this Not only would I fall on my
ass and kill myself but also I don't
know if I'm so strong that even if I had
the balance requisite dialed in I could
do meaningful reps withing a plate on a
side dude most people in the gym
legitimately cannot do this shoulder
press seated in a chair and this mother
is doing full ROM presses on a unicycle
if that's not a flex I don't know what
is ladies if this man has a I'd be
running right now out of the door to
find him is that AE is that can we say
that Scott or is that making the other
cut anyway typically guys have ladies
just letting you
know I can already tell Scott you can
let me know if uh if I'm wrong here this
guy is going to do brutal and he's
here for the pain that's exactly why I
picked him you nailed it oh man how did
I know brutal how did I know first of
all very few people with that foot
stance will use the belt squat if you're
using a belt Squad with that foot stance
you've been on team full ROM too many
goddamn times and you're masochist
another thing is his knees are coming
forward across his toes you know
somebody's in the
[Music]
pain dude the rebirth
unreal unreal and you know he wants it
cuz he's at it again most people
including myself after that rap would be
like that smoke a cigarette just leave
the gym I smoke in the gym really this
guy wants the pain and he is going to be
getting more and more jacked he's
already jacked I don't want to be like a
you're pling jacked you don't need to do
this to yourself his response would
probably be like ah and I just run away
scared good God this guy's my
hero that pause that pause at the bottom
Scott this is a lot more fun than
reviewing celebrities yeah I sure hope
this video does well so we can do a few
more of these they be like celebrities
take note simal lamro PT I assume he's
Brazilian uh or at least Portuguese this
guy's the man I would follow him if you
want to know what
trueing I don't know what this is the
slowness the depth the pause the
technique the intensity guys this is all
the engineers that make the app and all
the people at RP and Jared and Mike and
Crystal and Scott the video guy we all
jump on top of ourselves and we launch
one thing into the atmosphere as a
representation for everything good we've
ever done it's that guy doing that
exercise right now
[Music]
holy no no okay we
rack
a gold standard ladies take your
ass probably to Brazil it's nice there
anyway this man has
a find it right
now holy
 Viking Hill certainly is a man that
does not need others for pleasure if I
could get in that position I'd never
leave the house and it looks like he's
at home which makes a lot of sense
no
whoa I want this guy to be on social
media like famous and and someone's
like what are your favorite go-to
triceps movements he's like well um my
favorite movement is a little tough to
pull off like is that cuz you need a lot
of strength he's like yeah that too let
me demonstrate people are like oh I see
also he's looking directly into the
camera I now feel that I have a personal
relationship with Mr Viking Hill and
um man I uh it's a good relationship
too he touched his head on the ground
holy if this guy is not training
for the give yourself
championships of the world I have no
idea what he's doing with his life if
someone was like all right I have a
billion dollars Mike and I'm like okay
what do I do for it I'm getting my lip
gloss going they're like do that I'm
like there are many different variations
of Del raises oh do we have a narration
this one is yeah it's instructional
thank you Zach
each one hitting the front side and rear
delts great front delt exercise one of
the best you guys will see he's turning
his palms up exposing the vector of the
front delt it's a super crazy full range
of motion love love love around the
world primarily hit the side delts false
they hit primarily the front delts
that's because you turn the Palms up if
you turn the Palms down you guys will
notice all of a sudden the vector is
more side delt if you turn the Palms up
it's much more front delt you can just
see it right there front do contrac take
your sets to or near to failure great
advice and this is why I rarely count my
reps my body lets me know when I'm
finished yeah that's not a bad way to go
about it however your body isn't
directly talking to you it gets filtered
through your mind and if you have 14
reps from last week this week your body
quote unquote which is your mind might
just out on you and say yeah 12
that's close to failure and that's maybe
all you quote unquote had but if you
anchor your expectation and the fact
that it was 14 last time and I must get
15 this time using the RP hypertrophy
app there is no avoiding hard training
if you want to grow but if you want to
grow the most your training needs to be
hard and smart RP hypertrophy app will
make sure you're progressing on track
monitoring and adjusting your workout at
all times so for all that work you're
doing you can be sure you're getting the
best results
then you have a goal to hit and maybe
you'll fall short but you probably won't
if you periodize correctly like you can
through the rophy app then what's going
to happen is you're going to have a
landmark to hit and you will push your
body to hit that Landmark 14 this time
15 next time 16 the time after that
that's the kind of progression if you
just stop by feel your hardcore as like
Zach Smithy probably is going to work
great for you this mother trying at 110%
if you're having an off day if you you
know your your wife talked to you again
about look like if you don't get that
job promotion I'm going to leave you
Scott my wife's not around is she she
already left oh
God if you you know have something else
on your mind busy day kids wife family
work etc etc uh something like the rpop
app to keep track of your reps and give
you a little bit of a goal to shoot for
every time could be a really wise move
now again uh folks like back they may
benefit from other features of the app
but they don't need the push because
they're well quite by his face I can
tell he's psychotic in the best way
possible but uh for many of us yeah it's
a good idea to know where you're going
with this
stuff oh my
f holy that
is clavicles to Bar pull-ups Scott to
video guy does that look like underhand
to you yeah holy ball sack
this literally stopped playing
around probably years ago cuz this is
some serious ass
 oh yeah he cental control dead
hang oh my God these are
killer holy I mean we're on rep
number six or some here this is
freaky 80s lifting lady just left like
99.999% of all women behind in pull-ups
there's just no contest this is absurd
this is showing off this is like
Superman kicking a child across
Metropolis this is wild it's
outrageous and she's doing the bedroom
she comes out of the bedroom all pumped
up and exhausted the kids are like what
are you doing in there Mom she's like oh
yeah your dad's on a business trip mom's
working out later they recall that event
when they're like 18 and they're like
yeah some guy definitely crawled out of
the window the other way after mom came
out I know for a fact that's true turns
out nope she just had a rack for p set
up in her room I love
it holy fing this is still
happening and she's still controlling
the
Ecentric this is
grotesque no
way oh get out of here oh get out of
here she's going to milk it you're
 kidding me dude this is straight
up like Wonder Woman type this is
like this is wild Scott how many times
you seen this in the gym zero how many
times you seen this with professional
like lifters that we train also zero
this is wild this is in its own category
' 80s lifting lady you're doing the
goddamn thing all right M this guy
wanted do to roast
so we're sure about this volunteer to be
roasted how Okay Peter
McQueen everything I'm saying is all
love it's all a joke okay he was very
self-deprecating amazing

don't need to roast you cuz mother
you've been around roasted food long
enough look at the size of that gut
Jesus Christ you got a goddamn baby in
there you want to roast something take
the roast duck out of that ass and eat
it again like fat you probably would
godamn it is that Scott that what we
want he's like he seems like he's a good

a British name and the English humor is
the best in the world I I again Pete we
all boys you feel me my got a big my
gut's biger than that so you know you
bit you're but a child to me right he's

time if you guys want to see more of
this video with unrated content and a
bunch more other videos we publish every

Scott how many Politically Incorrect
references am I allowed to make here see
how the first one goes I would say uh
typically I would say ladies RJ's the
man and clearly he's earning that
so look him up but then I heard a
feemale in the
back I was going to say maybe that's his
girlfriend I don't know maybe it's just
a random girl that recording his phone
then I was also going to say about
something the fact that young black
males typically don't restrict
themselves to one woman which is just
true when you got swag you got to spread
it around let's see if we get banned for
that one RJ get that you're the man
