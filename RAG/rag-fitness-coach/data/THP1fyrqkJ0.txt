before I start pulling I'll lean back a
ton it's not a momentum thing where I'm
doing this it's not to lift more weight
I lean back a little bit and all of a
sudden this Arc here versus a straight
up and down feels like it hits my back
better so I'm slightly lean back I touch
and here's the important thing you still
want a big stretch at the top so I would
recommend leaning forward at the top to
get a big stretch reaching up with your
hands Lean Back pull Lean Forward lean
back and pull versus stay straight
up and just do lat pull Downs just like
that again there's no correct answer try
both see which one you seem to get a
better stimulus from
