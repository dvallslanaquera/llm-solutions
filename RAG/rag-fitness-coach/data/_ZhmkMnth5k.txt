hey folks
dr mike isrtel here for renaissance
periodization
hypertrophy concepts and tools lecture
number eleven quantitative exercise
selection using the four index
approach to hypertrophy training let's
take a look at what we have today
so we're gonna ask a big question
and then we're actually gonna answer it
today of are their best exercises
this is a super common question asked
all around social media
in gyms across the world what's the best
exercise what are the best exercises for
chest back legs arms you name it
then we're going to talk about in more
detail what we're actually asking when
we mean that
what does best mean we're going to talk
about effectiveness which we'll define
very very strategically
we're going to talk about efficiency
we're going to try to quantify
effectiveness of exercises we're going
to try to quantify the efficiency of
exercise
we're even going to attempt to combine
the two to find exercises that are most
effective
and efficient at the same time as you
can see that's sort of leading to what
maybe a best exercise would be
and then we're going to talk about the
sort of landscape that emerges from
that quantification and then we're going
to talk about a quick summary
of everything and some implications that
are really really really important
this lecture i don't want to say the
other lectures in the series are not
very important of course there are i
made them
right uh this is super duper important
stuff because
the concepts that come from here and you
might have heard of them before
the sfr stimulus fatigue ratio is the
big concept derived here and of course a
couple of related others
these are concepts that are going to
carry through in a big way through a
huge swath of training some of the most
important concepts
that we have in hypertrophy training so
let's get
right into it are there best exercises
some people say no that it's all
individual which is not entirely wrong
but
somewhat wrong right because we can then
ask
okay fine it's all individual but what
makes something a best exercise
for an individual certainly an
individual says i like hack squats
versus leg presses they must have some
reasoning to it
even if it's well they feel better what
specifically do you mean
feel how do they feel better do you feel
more of a muscle stimulus less joint
pain
something like that there's always a
level to dig deeper and seeing
it's all individual and stop thinking
about it doesn't really do us a whole
lot of good right
it's as if we say like you know what's
your favorite type of cuisine
and maybe there's no answer that's
correct for all people people have their
different types of cuisine you know like
japanese food or chinese food
like you know uh mexican food but you
know a really good culinary expert a
chef
can actually dig in to what you like
about japanese food
maybe you like the panko crust that they
use maybe you like the soy sauce that
they use
and they can take other cuisines and
make them more japanese-like or
serve you japanese food of the type you
really like it turns out maybe you
didn't like all japanese food you just
liked a couple of different ingredients
right
so there's always a little bit more than
just a general swath of well it's just
all individual well it's individual for
some reasons
let's find out what those reasons are
right
so really when it comes down to it the
best exercises can be quantified in a
way it doesn't mean it's easy but
theoretically
they're probably the ones that grow the
most muscle right especially over the
long term
but when we're talking about the long
term we also have to realize that
exercises that grow a lot of muscle in
the short term but cause a ton of
fatigue
are maybe not sustainable so now we're
maybe saying exercises that grow a lot
of muscle but also are long-term
sustainable which means just don't
produce a disproportionate amount of
fatigue
at the same time maybe that is getting
to
really really what it means to be a
better exercise but then we have a
question of efficiency
right maybe if you do a really good
exercise but it's just for your quads
your attitudes don't get hit at all your
glutes don't hit it all
your hamstrings don't get hit at all
your lower back doesn't get hit at all
maybe if there's one exercise
to do a very good but not perfect job at
hitting your quads and all those other
muscles it's so efficient it saves you
so much time
that you can spend more time elsewhere
you can spend more time recovering and
you can even do higher volumes in the
gym for all of those muscles because it
just doesn't take as much
maybe efficiency has to be a part of the
conversation
right so maybe an exercise is super
duper effective this is kind of just not
not worth the time like for example
you could say you know what's the most
effective way of you know making
uh figurines that you can collect and
say well the most efficient you know the
most effective way
is to have an artist custom make every
single one it takes one week for
figurine
okay it costs like 900 okay i guess
that's effective but what about if we
want to like have a lot of people have
these figurines for a low price
well then you're interested in
efficiency right and a stamping machine
might be able to
get like 90 of the quality in there but
like five dollars per figurine
we can't just say oh the stamping
machine that's not the most effective
way to make figurines uh
we're kind of getting away from what
effective means and i think efficiency
has to be part of the discussion so
we're for sure going to touch on that
so really there's no controversy all of
these things qualify for what a good
exercise is
it's what fits the individual what's
stimulating the most muscle growth it's
what's
causing the least fatigue cost per unit
of muscle stimulated
and probably what doesn't take forever
and is rather efficient if we can get
all those in the conversation
that's all things to consider right it
almost like if you talk about what's the
best computer to buy
with some someone says well it's all
about the monitor it's all about the
graphics card it's all about the
uh the hard disk capacity well maybe
it's all those right and if we talk
about all those we can say well you know
this computer
has sort of the best mix of all three
it's a good candidate for at least a
really good computer so if you recommend
one to someone maybe doesn't know
computers a whole lot
you're gonna be like hey this is random
or this is the worst very good computer
and we can get more specific
if need be and don't you worry we will
so
three specific quantities from that
discussion
can be melted down to talk about
a given exercise three specific
quantities concern us
number one is how much muscle per
working set can an exercise stimulate
the growth
of can it grow right we term this from
now on the raw stimulus magnitude of the
exercise
we don't care about how much fatigue it
causes we don't care about how long it
takes
how much muscle per working set doesn't
grow important question
okay raw stimulus magnitude is a lot to
say so we'll say rsm
for short number two question about an
exercise
how much fatigue does it generate in
relationship to its stimulus
that metric is the stimulus to fatigue
ratio
okay stimulus on top fatigue on bottom
so it's a good stimulus raw stimulus
this is an rsm on top
if it's really high great but so long as
fatigue is pretty low
and the lower fatigue is without
dragging the stimulus down higher
stimulus the lower the fatigue
the better the ratio that's the stimulus
to fatigue ratio that's the sfr
hugely important in hypertrophy training
because as you can probably tell
if you get a really great stimulus and
you get really low fatigue not only are
you growing muscle all the damn time but
you can do it sustainably for weeks and
weeks and weeks and months and months
and months
holy crap does that add up that's almost
in a way
pretty close to the gold standard of
hypertrophy training is finding high
stimulus to fatigue ratio exercises and
training methods
lastly because not everyone's interested
in raw stimulus magnitude
not everyone's actually interested in
fatigue if you have folks
that are looking for the best exercise
to fit their daily routine and they only
have two or three hours a week to train
or even less
they might be concerned with how long
things take so our third is how much
time does it take to reach a total
amount of stimulus
we want this much muscle growth stimulus
how do we pick exercises that take the
least amount of time to hit it
okay stimulus to time ratio or str for
short
can also be called the efficiency ratio
or just the efficiency of the exercise
very very specific when people say oh
man that technique is really efficient
they usually mean something else they
actually probably mean it has a high
stimulus to fatigue ratio
our mark of efficiency is the same as
efficiency in almost every other
metric which is process output versus
time that's it
right so if you can get a huge quad
stimulus in like five minutes
versus like 15 the efficiency the str is
clearly higher right so those
are our three quantities or three
proxies that really really really
concern us
right now for now we've just said
okay we have this thing called a raw
stimulus magnitude
and it's supposed to tell us about how
much growth of
exercise or technique can generate
per set but how do we you know how do we
know that what do we mean by growth
of course we can't really measure it
directly because that would be crazy and
super impractical so we have to use
proxies
right proxies that use general
indicators of growth they're absolutely
not perfect
but they can give us a really big hint
as to what's going on
there are three of them that we're super
concerned about
these are three proxies of growth
stimulus let's go through them
one by one the first growth stimulus
proxy
in training this is something we're
perceiving is what we can term the mind
muscle connection
now the mind muscle connection in the
hypertrophy context does not mean
you feel your bicep feeling your bicep
has
nothing to do with how much your bicep
grows because watch this
do i feel my bicep contracting yeah hell
yeah i do i can even like
really focus on it be like wow i feel
the stretch and the contraction is this
growing muscle course not because
there's no load
there's no stimulus being imposed it's
just feeling the muscle work
so a lot of people abuse the mind muscle
connection so to speak or misinterpret
it
and they'll use exercise in which they
can really feel a muscle but there's not
a ton of stimulus
not a ton of overload being imposed on
that muscle how do we tell it's overload
while also feeling the muscle that's
mind-muscle connection it's composed of
basically two
factors that based on the rep range
you're doing
one is more dominant than the heavy
ranges one tends to be more dominant in
the lighter ranges in the heavy ranges
a high mind muscle connection means that
you are perceiving a high degree of
tension through put through the target
muscle
so for example if you're doing curls
hard sets of eight
right and you feel a ton of tension in
your forearms but someone says like yeah
you feel that in your biceps you're like
i gotta be honest i don't the raw
stimulus magnitude at least on that
metric one of three
to the biceps not as great as it could
be but if you do some kind of curl
variant when you feel the tension
pulling and ripping your bicep every
single rep gee whiz
that's probably causing some growth
right because tension is a huge
probably the biggest stimulator of
growth if you feel high tension in your
target muscle
that's a good thing remember you don't
have to necessarily feel
attention to the target muscle which
could mean that the target muscle is not
being exposed as much as it can
for example if someone tells you hey
this way of doing lunges is really great
for your glutes
but you feel a ton of pull and pressure
in your quads and nothing in your glutes
maybe it's good for your glutes on some
other metrics but maybe
it has left something to be desired
here's the thing
when you move into the higher rep ranges
sets of 10 to 20 and especially 20 to 30
gee you know you don't really perceive a
ton of mind altering ripping tension
through the muscle because the weight's
never that heavy
you might perceive it a little bit more
towards the end of a set but by then
you're tired
it's just not enough load however
if the target muscle is actually being
contracted it is almost certainly going
to generate a lactic acid burn
especially as you get close to failure
which is where you're supposed to be
training anyway
so especially in sets of 20 to 30 reps
and to some extent in the 10 to 20 range
the mind muscle connection is when
you're doing the exercise and getting
close to failure
are you getting a lactic acid burn or
whatever metabolites are occurring
lactic acid being the primary one are
you getting a painful
physical burn in the target muscle
itself
again with a curling allergy if you're
doing high rep curls and you feel a huge
burn
in your forearms but nothing in your
biceps not great
but if you switch grips from straight
bar to easy bar all of a sudden you feel
a
huge burn in your biceps towards the end
of a set of 20 reps
man that's a pretty good sign now is
it's not tension
versus a burn both usually happen at the
same time especially if you look at the
middle
range okay if you take the 10 to 20 rep
range
are you going to get a pump or sorry are
you going to get tension perceived yeah
plenty not a ton but
plenty you're going to notice are you
going to get a burn
in that target muscle yeah almost
certainly not as bad of burn as you get
with 25
reps but still something noticeable you
get sort of 50 50 mix in that 10 to 20
range
if you move into the 5 to 10 rep range
you get mostly tension not a ton of burn
no problem because the tension's higher
burns lower on average
still the same sum of stimulus and if
you move into the lighter ranges the 20
to 30 rep range
your burn is crazy your tension's not as
high again they sum to roughly the same
amount
okay so that's number one
mind muscle connection some combination
tension perceived
through the target muscle not just in
general and
uh some amount of burn okay the more the
merrier on both
next up number two is do you get a pump
okay a pump
first of all is has been shown to
directly
cause hypertrophy via the cell swelling
effect but also
a pump is usually going to occur when
you've had a lot of metabolites move
through the muscle when you generate a
ton of tension you get reactive
hyperemia
which is blood flow back into the muscle
more than what was in and fluid flow
more than what was in before
you get all those things and they're
sort of both direct indicators a pump
uh of growth and indirect indicators
that something happened that probably
will also cause growth
the bigger your pumps per set number
probably the more growth you have
everything else being equal
right so if you do peck flies with a new
machine and after four sets someone's
like you got a peck pump and you're like
eh right it might not be the greatest
machine or place you put your hands for
you or rep range or whatever
but if you do a new chest fly machine
and after two sets you're like oh my god
my chest is gonna fall off my body right
then
gee that's probably a really good thing
some folks will say
well pumps are more likely to be caused
by higher upsets
there might be some truth to that but
not as much as you would think
folks that have muscles that are
predominantly faster twitch
actually get their best pumps from
relatively low reps
people at a real real fast twitch in the
triceps for example
sets of eight skull crushers a close
grip bench giving this huge pump
sets of 25 kind of give them this
diffuse tired feeling
that just they kind of feel like zone
was zonked out right
it's almost like if folks with an
average fiber type sort of 50 50 fast
slow
if you went on like a two mile run would
you get a crazy quad pump
no right you quads just feel kind of
tired and strung out
people who are very fast which muscles
usually feel like that in those muscles
when the reps are really really high so
does a pump on average
accumulate over higher rep sets yeah to
some extent so it's a better indicator
for higher rep sets
for sure don't worry we have that high
tension to indicate with lower upsets
but in general it occurs at a variety of
rep ranges especially
based on what fiber type you have or
fraction of fiber type
number three so so far we got mind
muscle connection we got pump
lastly we have muscle disruption
which can be proxied by three relatively
different things
uh real nuanced discussion here but it's
important because this is remember
advanced concepts and tools so we're
getting real super in-depth
the first kind of detector of muscle
disruption
is perturbation which basically means
something is not right with your muscles
if you are truly overloading and pushing
muscles to the limit
things will get displaced structures
will get damaged that damage might not
itself cause growth but it sure as heck
is a good correlate of you doing a real
good job of stimulating
perturbation can present itself in both
a sensation right like you you flex your
bicep and you're like this sounds
off someone's like why is something off
you're like i just did eight sets of ten
curls
i just feel my biceps feel strange don't
feel normal
another way to put this is if you do
something you thought was really
stimulative
to your biceps and after you know five
sets or whatever that someone's like how
do your biceps feel like
100 fine did you really grow a ton or
set a lot of growth into motion probably
not right but if you're like oh i don't
i don't know man something feels off
you've been perturbed another really
super easy example of this
is walking up and down stairs after a
super crazy quad workout that's easily
the most obvious example
um you try to go down the stairs and go
your legs are shaking
they're just not working right that's
probably a good sign that they got
totally stimulated i'll put you this way
if you want your best quad workout ever
and someone's like i got it bro
do this workout it's on bosu balls weird
cables and they're like your quads are
smashed
i guess i believe you and they're like
alright see you later bro you gotta walk
down two flights of stairs
and you just hop skip down flights of
stairs and your quads feel fine
you did not get your best quad workout
ever best quad workout ever
remember don't do this all the time
because it's gonna cause too much
chronic damage
is when you don't know if you're gonna
make it down the stairs every step you
take your quads sort of shake and sort
of contract sort of don't they might
cramp up
right that is perturbation that means
you did something
very related but not the same thing is
local fatigue
right the target muscle itself is a very
tired
which is not a perceptive thing it's a
performance there so for example if
someone's like hey man i have this
crazy crazy hamstring thing to try this
new exercise
you do the new exercise for like plenty
of sets and then you go and hit a pr
right after on hamstring curls
and i gotta be honest man your
hamstrings were not stimulated because
stimulus that is overloading makes you
fatigued
locally at the target muscle which isn't
a bad thing it's just part of the
process
so if you detect no local fatigue
because your performance isn't down
i don't know if you have the chest
workout of your life
okay and then someone say hey try doing
a set of push-ups and after three
push-ups you're like
you fall you're like my chest isn't
working clearly your push-up strength is
down
locally because of the pecs your pecs
probably got hit
all right so that's another factor we're
going to use and then lastly
soreness right and soreness doesn't have
to be delayed onset muscle soreness
it could be anything from like things
feel sort of tight and weird kind of an
extension of the perturbation effect for
a few hours after training
to things a little bit sore like later
that evening or the day after
all the way to three or four day doms
now
dom's is not necessarily a great great
great thing if it's taken to an extreme
because we we have a really good
suspicion through plenty of literature
now
that an excessive amount of muscle
damage actually costs you growth because
your body's so busy fixing itself it
doesn't even get a chance to grow
so there is that so it's not like the
more the merrier even with all of these
right but a certain amount of these have
to be checkmarked right
so the more you get of all these the
higher the stimulus is
likely to be there is such a thing as
too much stimulus because of too much
damage etc
but within a really wide range the more
the better
right so if you do an exercise that
causes a
ton of tension through your target
muscle let's say
you're training your glutes this new a
new hip thrust variation causes a ton of
tension in your goose
holy crap my glutes are feeling like
they're gonna pop right and then when
you switch to higher reps it's a crazy
glute burn and you're like ah
you're running around like your ass is
on fire you get a huge glute pump out of
it
and like you try walking down the stairs
later your glutes are sort of cramping
misfiring though but i did something and
like you can barely get out of your car
so clearly your glute strength is down
and then you get sore for two or three
days after in your glutes
gee you know it's really hard to say
that that's not a very effective
exercise
especially if you did very few sets of
it and if you continue to feel like that
through weeks and weeks of training
you're probably well on your way
versus right and this is how to use this
uh growth stimulus proxy this raw
stimulus magnitude
that what i just described is probably
higher stimulus magnitude because it
checks all the three boxes pretty well
what about uh a low ross stimulus
magnitude someone said hey listen i got
this
you know glute exercise for you to try
it's super novel it's super awesome and
maybe it's super complicated it looks
like an s
m dungeon setup you're like wow okay
this person knows what he's doing
i've paid less for snm you know so
leave that in so you know
after after um
you know you try their like weird glute
contraption thing that they invented
um you know during the set and right
after
there's not really a ton of tension
being put through your glutes and maybe
even worse
you feel a lot of tension in your calves
and your hamstrings you're like
okay like i'm getting work done but i
think it's with my calves and hamstrings
there's no burn that you can tell on
your glutes but again your calves are
really burning from this weird hip
extension thing they're having you do
i think i'm doing this wrong no no trust
me everything's fine
you don't really get a glute pump like
your glute's pumped and you're like nope
can't tell
and then there's no perturbation your
glutes feel just fine you can hop skip
just fine after the workout is over
you hop skip in and out of your car as a
matter of fact you do some squats after
you come close to hitting a squat pr and
you're like that's not supposed to
happen if my glutes are really
messed up and uh the day later they call
you
i don't know why they call you your home
but you pick up your your home landline
phone from 1982
and you're like hello and like that's
your glute trainer and you're like hey
what's up guy
and they're like are your are you glutes
sore and you're like no actually they're
not
right those are the opposite of check
boxes
right and uh if we had to rank this on a
scale you know which
exercise would you use the one that
really messed you up and really did all
those things that we talked about just
earlier
or this one you know i wouldn't go with
this one right so there's absolutely
something to these
growth proxies they're not perfect but
boy are they better than nothing
next we got raw stimulus great we got
the three component model
now a three component model of fatigue
how do we figure out a fatigue well per
exercise
if your joints and connective tissues
hurt
or are disrupted basically feel strange
or hurt over time or
increase how much pain you experience
over time either rep to rep
set to set exercise to exercise
or over the weeks that you do the
exercise not great
right so if you do a hack squat for
example and it's a weird machine that
you're like i wonder if this would be
great for my quads
even if your quads are getting a big hit
if your knees are really hurt like not
in a good way
and then the second time you do it they
hurt even more and then between
the time the second and third time they
hurt like at night when you're sleeping
and then by the third time you can
barely use any weight because your knees
are popping open
man that's just not really great that's
a lot of local fatigue exactly where you
don't want it which is joints and
connective tissues right
second point how much perceived effort
do you have to put out percent
for example if you're doing some kind of
pec fly
which has a real easy setup you guys
know those machines that just groove
with you
right you you squeeze you know the
handles you pull it in
and you get a great pump all that stuff
tons of raw stimulus magnitude
but to be honest like when you approach
failure because it's just your packs
you're like oh
and then you uh you can't do it you've
reached through failure but someone's
like man is that tough you're like
i get a great pump i really feel an apex
i can't say i'm like emotionally have to
like
really just psych up versus someone's
like hey man
you got to try this new thing for your
pecs they give you like a bench
with a bench shirt and bands and chains
why not and it's 500 pounds on the bar
plus 200 bands and chains but the
shirt's gonna save you so you take the
weight out it just takes you everything
to unrack it
you're gonna go down and then you're
gonna use everything you can to come up
and it's super super hard
and you do a couple sets of that you're
fried you literally like it's all 10 rpe
and then at the end of that someone's
like so like how much of a pec pump do
you have you're like
none right how much tension did you feel
in your packs i have no idea where i
felt that tissue i was just trying not
to die
man you know from bodybuilding
perspective keeping fatigue low
probably not the best idea which is why
now an exercise like that may be great
for something like equipped power
lifting
here's the real big kicker equipped
power lifters when they get done with
their shirted pressing with bands and
chains
when they want extra pack hypertrophy
work they don't just do more shirt or
pressing of bands and chains because
intuitively they know it's got a crappy
stimulus to fatigue ratio
too much fatigue what they're going to
do is they're going to switch to doing
some pack flies or some raw bench or
some weighted push-ups or some dips
something that hits the pecs pretty well
but doesn't cause a lot of fatigue so
we're not saying you're not supposed to
be trying we're saying
per unit of stimulus especially if you
don't have to
bleed out onto the floor and dry your
brain
trying and if you can get an awesome
stimulus without trying that hard
if you try super hard because there's
always a time to go balls to the wall
you'll get even more of a stimulus right
so per
unit of stimulus how much perceived
exertion is there
the lower the better right per unit of
signals
lastly this is direct measure it's
actually completely objective
is a measurement of true systemic
fatigue
systemic fatigue local fatigue is like
i'm training biceps how tired are my
biceps easy to measure because you just
measure your bicep strength after
workout you're like well apparently
really fucked up which is really good
right because local fatigue is
stimulative to some extent and certainly
indicative of stimulus to the target
muscle
systemic fatigue not at all right
systemic fatigue is fatigue that
generally bleeds into other training
and it hurts your other training it
hurts your other adaptive responses like
if you ride your biceps and there's a
ton of systemic fatigue and now it's
time to train triceps your triceps
training is going to be limited because
you're so tired you won't actually be
able to activate
the target muscle and push it to its
limits nearly as much as possible
right how do we measure this well it
turns out it's really objectively easy
to measure
how much strength fall off does this
exercise cause in unused muscles
for example if you have
a set up for your traps right
and you have two setups one is you have
like you figured out a dumbbell trap
contraption
where you you use the 70s in each hand
full range of motion big squeeze big
stretch your traps get
blown out and then after you go do calf
raises
you just have to do calves that day you
hit a bunch of calf raised prs you feel
great nothing's fine but it's not a ton
of systemic fatigue
right after the you know the shrugs you
don't feel
super fucked up or anything everything
feels fine right
on the other hand maybe you got another
idea about training traps
and you decided you were gonna load a
barbell up and do like you know
the funky pigeon dance where you mostly
just move your neck and not your
shoulders a lot
you have to load 800 pounds on the bar
you barely get it off the ground
funky pigeon for a while and then you go
do calves and you're so your spine has
been compressed so much
it took you so much gusto to physically
lift the bar
that now your calf training if you guys
ever do a really hard session of
anything
and then you have to do a smaller muscle
group after and you're like uh i don't
even know if i'm alive enough to do this
you do calves after that one and your
calf performance is down significantly
which means that the trap work you just
did systemically bled into everything
including your calves limiting their
performance which is
not a good thing ideally an exercise for
a local muscle
should minimally affect other muscles so
that all that stimulus we're putting in
all that disruption is to that muscle to
make it grow
any of the other stuff that bleeds out
and affects the performance of unused
muscles
yeah sometimes we have to pay the cost
but the min the
smaller the cost the better which is why
folks like high level bodybuilders
usually do
lots of leg presses maybe squats after
leg presses lots of leg extensions
because those do a very decent job of
stimulating the quads but they don't
have a ton of systemic carry over
whereas you figure man why don't they
just lift as much weight as possible and
do something like low bar squats for
their quads
low bar squats are great quad builders
the problem is they systemically fatigue
so many other muscles and just spill
over into everything
that if you're supposed to train quads
again later that week you might not be
able to because the fatigue is too high
so systemic
takes a while to bring down and also you
might train hamstrings after quads just
have nothing left
right if you do a bunch of leg
extensions and a bunch of hack squats
you may go to leg curls and feel 100
fine and do a great workout if you do a
ton of low bar squatting
you might get to leg curls just die
right on the machine right because your
performance is down so much you might
not be able to
really zap your hamstrings so the less
joint and connective tissue disruption
we have per unit of volume usually
percent
how much psychological arousal we have
to have the rating of perceived exertion
the lower the better
and how much performance falloff do we
have the lower the better
if all of those are low while the
stimulus is high raw stimulus we're off
to a
real real real good start
lastly on this line of thinking
determining time requirements because
remember we have effectiveness
we have the from a perspective of raw
stimulus magnitude
we have the fatigue perspective which we
just covered and now we have to cover
the efficiency perspective which means
how much time does it take to do the
exercise this is actually super super
simple
brush right through it first question
there's three here as well
how long does the exercise take to warm
up and set up for okay
if you come to the gym and you want to
blast your chest and you're training
with one of your clients
your client has 30 minutes you're not
going to set up this crazy bands and
chains
cable linked attachment in the middle of
the gym it takes you an hour
to set up to you know really really
stupid to do
right you want to er push-ups right like
warm up
with you know partial push-ups and then
get right into full range push-ups that
warm-up takes 30 seconds okay versus
like a ton of crazy setup
things that take a long time to warm up
for maybe also not the greatest dia from
an efficiency perspective
if you have to do like four or five warm
up sets for something man you know maybe
pick another exercise which just doesn't
require that much warming up
it's throwing that out there absolutely
real world concern
second concern how many muscle groups
does the exercise overload or come close
to overloading
right gives meaningful stimulator volume
to at the same time
right if you have a regular this is one
of my absolute biggest pet peeves
for folks that have been following my my
work and my youtube stuff for a long
time you know i've touched on this
before but either by analogy or just by
pure rant
um you have someone who is like a 45
year old business woman
and she's being trained by a personal
trainer who knows fuck all and
he's got her doing you know she's got 35
minutes during her lunch hour three
times a week to train with him
and he's got her doing like cable iso
lateral rear delt
exercise are you kidding me if you're a
pro bodybuilder
and the judge has said look you really
need to bring up your adults and your
fatigue is already crazy high levels you
can barely put in any kind of
overloading work
then you do that exercise because you
need your rear adults to come up
at a very small fatigue price if you're
a person with super limited time and you
want to train most of your body
that exercise is such a huge waste of
time is it trains the teeniest tiniest
of one muscle at a time
they literally reared out them folks
that size is like the size of a thumb
there you are spending five minutes
doing one side at a time which is itself
ridiculous right
we can do better something like a face
pull
for that same person still cable okay so
we're not like throwing away the cable
station
face pull with the rope takes care of
the rear delts to some extent the cytos
the traps the biceps and all the other
forearm flexors and even your grip
and it does all of that with two arms at
a time slashing the time at least in
half
and putting in a bunch of extra muscle
groups compound
basics almost always win this
battle because they train so many muscle
groups at the same time
if i see folks in the gym and they're
regular folks with a limited time and
they're doing anything other
than if the very most basic isolations
like a barbell curl or tricep extension
but mostly compound moves i get real
irritated
not for real but as a joke because gee
they're written real
ripped off you know someone who's you
know in their 40s or 50s trying to stay
in shape
busy family life busy career life and
then we're doing
iso lateral calf extensions unreal waste
of time
right you could be doing squats with a
slight jump at the top get
calves quads glutes everything be out of
the gym in 20 minutes
one of the group of people that do this
really well is actually crossfit and the
other fitness sports
gyms like that that make you go through
a circuit of mostly compound
exercises it's a huge workout in a
totally limited time
compounds win this battle now lastly
was the question of how long the average
set takes which most sets take
about the same amount of time and this
includes the rest time after each
average set
so if you're doing something like sumo
deadlifts
the setup not the setting up the bar but
the setup for the set can take some time
that counts on a set time because you
gotta find your feet real precisely
find your hands real precisely you do
stop and start reps that takes a long
time it's a long set
and then you have to rest a real long
time between sets because your technique
is going to break down if you don't with
deadlifts
maybe that's not the greatest exercise
in the world as far as
saving time if you run into the gym and
you have very low amount of time
and you've got to do something like that
maybe sumo squats are a little bit
better
because you can sort of do them more
quickly the setup's not as precise
because all you have to do is put the
bar on your back and step out relatively
wide there doesn't need to be this
perfection involved
because with sumo deadlifting if you get
your feet wrong a little bit especially
if you're more advanced
it throws off the entire movement with
sumo squatting and you kind of body
adjust a little bit more
and then maybe the rest time doesn't
have to be as long because you know if
you're still tired from squatting you
can still do pretty decent squats it
doesn't automatically break down your
technique
squatting is sort of like the exercise
folds you into the right technique
eight times out of ten if you're
relatively advanced if you're dead
lifting and you start way too early your
lower back goes and everything else goes
to shit afterwards right
so we have to keep in mind to keep the
exercises relatively simple
and maybe use exercises that don't take
a long time to rest another good
comparison
is super arch powerlifting style bench
press you take some time to execute set
up for and do and you have to rest a
while because your back has to de-cramp
versus like a weighted deep push-up
rather similar pectoral and tricep
stimulus right same muscles are getting
stimulated front delts as well
but g you know after a 30 or 45 seconds
of rest between deep push-ups you can go
again and have a really great productive
set
because you're not limited by other
muscles such as lower back so on and so
forth so all these things count
and if you factor all them in it tells
you how long you're going to be at the
gym and if you have a certain raw
stimulus magnitude that's this
if your time commitment shrinks that's a
good thing because look if you have an
hour in the gym you could just do more
stuff and add it in
or if you're one of these people that
the less time you spend in the gym the
better because you have so many other
priorities in life
if you find all the exercises that have
the fewest time requirements while
having a good raw stimulus magnitude
then you can end up cutting your routine
from 45 minutes a day four days a week
to 30 minutes a day four days a week and
you've got that much more time to do
other stuff in your life
so visually we can rate this on
a ranking scale so a stimulus right
determining raw stimulus magnitude is
really straightforward
we have one two and three my muscle pump
and muscle disruption
and we have a rating scale of zero one
two and three
you can make these up yourself okay all
that managers are consistent
zero means you basically just didn't
register anything on any of these right
so someone's like hey what was your mind
muscle connection to your biceps
on squats you're like zero okay great
squats are not
good for the biceps right versus three
could be like you did some kind of easy
bar
and every single rep feels like your
biceps were being torn apart
as a whole muscle wow okay
super high tension or the bird was like
cataclysmic and you drop the bar like
you guys know when your biceps are
burning you have no idea where to put
them because you actually can't put them
anywhere they're attached to your body
right that would be a three and then one
and two or somewhere in between those
right
pump effect zero is you do an exercise
for multiple sets and you get no pump in
the target muscle
three is you look like uh the michelin
man you're like oh my god i can't move
my pecs you can't brush your teeth
because you can't reach your mouth
really really good sign there and then
muscle reception a zero
is literally you get no loss there's no
perturbation you get no loss of
performance whatsoever and you get
no soreness at all just as far as you
can tell nothing happened right
if someone gave you one of those men in
black memory zappers after you did
a bicep workout with a zero rating you
know you wake up a day later and then be
like did you train your biceps you'd be
like
i don't i don't think so right versus
imagine if you got a number three style
workout muscle reception
and you got alien you know uh men and
black zapped with your memory you wake
up the next day and be like what the
hell happened to me you're like oh
fuck my biceps i can't even brush my
teeth like clearly something happened
right
so there's that zero to three scale and
one and two are in between
rate as honestly as you can if you rate
various exercises for the same muscle
group
you might see that some of them are just
better than others here's a really cool
tip but i'm going to repeat a couple
more times
you don't have to do all this math
necessarily just keep it in mind to
yourself
just have an awareness of what this is
if someone says hey
do you know do you get a better raw
stimulus from barbell curls generally
or this machine curl over there you know
if you're like i don't know
maybe you should think about it more
maybe you should do an actual ranking
system
next up sfr so all we do is we take the
stimulus and then we divide it
by fatigue as you can see fatigue rank
the same way on a zero to three scale
so joint and connective tissue
disruption you know
for these the lower the better right so
if joint connective tissue disruption is
zero that means that nothing happened to
your joints connective tissues you could
even tell
you're like man this leg press i could
let breasts forever and it wouldn't feel
a thing in my knees or my hips
that's awesome right versus three is
like every time i do the leg press every
rep feels worse and worse i literally
feel like i'm training my knees instead
of my quads and i'm not training them in
a good way
bad news right because as you get the
higher numbers here
you'll notice it's a fraction if you get
low stimulus numbers right we're adding
all these together by the way
with stimulus you get a three on the
mind muscle you get three on the pump
you get a three and a muscle disruption
that's a sum total of
nine you just write nine in that new
numerator
right and then fatigue if you get threes
on all of them that's a nine in the
denominator that would be a ranking of
one
one's not great one's like sort of
average it means you're about the same
stimulus as fatigue
what you want is the higher numbers like
ideally you get something like a three
that would be incredible
right so three on top one on bottom like
way more stimulus than fatigue that's
really great you really want to stay
away
from exercises or technique variations
that are the opposite leave you one
third
one on top three on bottom that means
you're getting one unit of stimulus
with three units of fatigue you can't
compare them directly but it's bad news
right bad news the higher the number on
top the lower the number on the bottom
the better right uh moving on as there
was rpe
right if you feel like you basically
exerted no effort uh then it's a zero if
it took you literally life and limb
to not literally figuratively life in
limb to complete the set or number of
sets then that's probably a three
one and two or in between and of course
unused uh strength fall off
you know if you do this crazy bicep
workout and then you go to triceps and
you literally experience no strength
whatsoever
that's really great that's a zero and if
the three is like
you can be you like it looks like you
recessed four years of your training
career
if you do this bicep stuff before
triceps you're like oh great my triceps
basically don't work anymore
i used to do extensions with 100 pounds
for a sets of 10. now i'm doing it with
50
right huge unused falloff huge systemic
fatigue
really really bad news you run these
numbers that gets you your stimulus to
fatigue ratio
remember the higher the numerator
numerator the lower the denominator
the better not really any rocket science
there
and same idea with the str stimulus on
top
time on the bottom and again we do this
ranking system you don't actually have
to measure time but you can
warm-ups if the warm-ups you could
basically just show up to the gym and
start doing
the exercise that's a zero if it takes
like a crazy amount of warming up that's
a three
it's all individual right but an example
is i trained with
chad russell smith a number of times and
uh back when he was a super high level
competitive power lifter
he would warm up uh to squat roughly 800
pounds in training
but he would usually just add a 45 and
he would take like three or four minutes
between each set the sword of god we
were there for 45 minutes before he hit
his first working set like
gee whiz that's a lot of warming up if
chad wanted to blast his quad super
quick
uh he wouldn't do all he basically
wouldn't do do a heavy squat he'd
probably start on a leg extension
do working sets all the way up to a
higher weight and then get in a leg
press and blast it they would be
very very short time right muscle groups
uh zero muscle group this is a little
bit confusing because remember we want
time to be short
a rank zero is like an exercise that
hits a ton of your muscle groups all at
the same time maybe all of them
rank zero would be like uh a clean
to squat to squat back up to a press
something like that like it hits like
90 of your muscles in your body like
holy crap that's really good
a three i got an example earlier from
the three
stupid tricep extension people do with
the one arm cable
that's a three it's terrible it takes
forever
because it hits one tiny muscle group at
the same time the only way to do worse
is like you're like take a little mini
dumbbell and you curl it on your pinky
you're like i'm doing pinky curls
next step bro i'm going to do this ring
finger and middle finger et cetera
ridiculous right and then lastly the set
and restoration
right a zero would be something like you
could hop skip between sets for example
push-ups to pull ups push-ups to pull
ups a very little
rest right or something like a even
better example is
you do calf raises and then you do
forearm curls right after calf raises
form curls
basically no interference neither one of
them makes you breathe hard there's
almost no systemic cost
literally the rest time is zero and the
set duration's super short because
they're really low amplitude movements
or on the other hand a three
would be like an equipped squatting
setup where people have to put your
squat suit on you put it on the straps
you got to take it out of a motto you
got to have three spotters all of them
have to congregate at you at some point
as soon as you rack the weight after you
have to take your knee wraps off which
takes forever you
put them on first which takes a long
time unstrap or suit so on and so forth
right so if someone said hey do you ever
do any equipped squatting
with your regular clients you'd be like
what are you out of your mind we'd do
one set and it would run out of time
right
so that's the str really really
straightforward and you can do these
calculations on your own
now we can hypothetically
combine effect and efficiency and get
something that
we won't talk about a ton called the
sftr
the stimulus to fatigue and time ratio
it sounds super fancy but it's really
just combining sfr and str
stimulus on top same as usual and then
you get
fatigue and time on the bottom right you
just add up fatigue and time
stimulus on top and then all of a sudden
you have the situation where you're
ranking
uh something uh really really you know
at the end of the day it integrates how
much training you're getting as far as
training response stimulus
and with as little fatigue and as little
time as possible
the big upside with sftr is if something
if an exercise in your arsenal has a
really high sftr
it's probably just a really good
exercise but on the other hand
it's not always time to do high sftr
because sometimes
sfr is more important because you have
lots of time
and sometimes str is more important
because you're so low on time
you might actually not be as concerned
with a huge stimulus or low fatigue
as you just are with minimizing that
time required
on that note we go to the next slide
which is the sftr
landscape okay we have this graph here
it looks super complicated i promise
it's not here's how to read this
we have the y-axis that's asking us how
high our mrv is our maximum recoverable
volume which is really
how much stimulus how much training can
we take
and the x-axis is asking us how much
time
we have to train okay if you have
someone
who is a crazy high mrv like they don't
really need to be worried about fatigue
because they basically can't train up to
how much fatigue they can't tolerate
anyway
and they can train a lot right they have
a lot of time to train
maybe exercises with the highest raw
stimulus magnitudes are the best for
them
right hard gainers with lots of free
time for example like if you're a
college student you got a lot of free
time
but you know your gains don't come super
easy to you you need to do the exercises
that are the highest rating most
magnitudes because someone say well but
they cost too much fatigue who cares
i've never
hit my mrv i just need stuff to grow me
so
these kinds of folks might do like lots
of deadlifts
for back for example because like are
deadlifts
great for back as far as stimulus to
fatigue ratio no because they're super
fatiguing
really high raw stimulus though
especially for spinal erectors traps and
rhomboids
uh and on that note you know if you have
the time because deadlifts take a long
time
and if you have the mrv they're a great
back builder they're just not a great
back builder if you're
really short on time or if your mrv is
limited right
then we move down into the next quadrant
below
if your mrv isn't super high right or
you're able to reach it readily
it means you can't just be pissing away
fatigue all the time but you can train a
while
you want to look for exercises that have
a higher stimulus to fatigue ratios
right
uh competitive bodybuilders are perfect
example they have tons of time to train
but they're so so big and strong
so close to their limits that they can't
exactly just piss away fatigue all the
time
right so in that case we have to pick
the highest so fire exercise which is
you know you see bodybuilders doing lots
of like leg curls and leg
extensions leg process and you think man
they could get in and out of the gym way
quicker if they just did like stiff
legged nelson squats right but they
would be paying a huge fatigue cost for
that
time they have fatigue tolerance they
don't right
then we go up to the top left quadrant
high mrv or you're no risk of reaching
it a lot of times because you can't
dedicate the training time and low
amount of time that you could train
busy professional right then you want
high sdr exercises that rank high on the
sdr index
something like a crossfitter right not a
competitive crossfitter but someone who
does crossfit
uh you know two or three days a week
they're automatically going to be going
to high sdr movements they're not doing
single cable extensions across but i
promise you that
because people there have no problem
recovering from training a lot of times
because they can't do enough training to
recover
but really they just don't have a ton of
time right lastly
default you want to pick high
sftr exercises anyway but where sftr
really plays a big role is
if your mrv is not very high you're very
limited
and you're limited on time everything
constrained
the cream rises to the top the highest
sftr exercises
win that but remember there are some
good exercises through all of this
depending on the situation you're in so
if you want the best effect period the
most muscle grown
period for any given session just go
with a high raw stimulus
someone says look you need a bigger back
period you're like well i never get
fatigued i have a ton of time
you're going to dead lift and row until
you're broken all right then you'll have
a really big back
if you want the best effect but your
fatigue is a limiting factor a real
world factor you're big you're strong
your recovery is limited
high sfr is where to go most of the
folks listening to this lecture
probably are in that situation which is
why sfr is such a huge concept and such
an important tool
if you want the best effect but your
time is a limiting factor and you're not
so concerned about fatigue anymore we
are concerned
about efficiency and you have the
highest str exercises
as your age remember a lot of times
these are different exercises the best
str exercise for the quads
might not be the best slr exercise for
quad so it's situation specific
for you for your clients and for
everyone in between
another really cool thing just lastly on
the str is you can improve your sdr by
not actually focusing on the exercise
selection itself but other variables
as well for example compound antagonist
supersets
you got regular clients in the gym you
want them to work as much as possible
with a limited time what you can do is
they can do a set of push-ups
rest no time at all do a set of
pull-downs right because they're
antagonist muscles the local muscles
aren't tired from the pushing that are
used for the pulling
then they get a little tired
systemically you give them 30 seconds
and then you cycle back through that
it heats huge swaths of muscle pretty
well
but in a really really short time so
compound antagonist supersets are
something i think that
most i mean this most regular folks in
the personal training community
should be doing most of their training
with compound antagonist supersense
absolutely drives me up the wall when
people are doing bodybuilding routines
for folks to train two or three times a
day
tons of rest between sets tons of
isolations really really really stupid
right also for folks
that have limited time sometimes
maximizing the work to rest
ratios uh are probably a good idea
and these are generally seen at a lower
loading zones that is to say higher rep
ranges so
if you do sets of five in order for them
to be effective sets of five for most
people
you're going to rest quite a bit between
sets a lot of stimulus per set but you
need a lot of rest you don't just brush
that's
five but if you're doing sets of 15 to
30
reps same amount of general hypertrophy
per set but you might be able to take a
30 second break between them and go and
go and go
so when folks come in and you want them
to train
get as big of a stimulus as possible in
the shortest time as possible highest
sdr
not only are you going to be going for
the exercises to let you get there but
you're going to be using them in
compound attack in a superset fashion
and you're going to be doing probably
higher reps does this sound like
something to you
yeah crossfit right they got it figured
out on this end you know maybe not
directly all of crossfit because some of
the stuff they're just trying to get
better at different activities but
a lot of what you're going to be doing
as a personal trainer to save time and
have a huge stimulus
is going to look like crossfit like
something like it a lot of work
high rep ranges the right exercises and
very little rest between sets
compound antagonists can do that super
well right
at the end of the day it's probably
worth figuring out which exercises for
you and your clients or the highest sftr
but just the best of all worlds and
really only stray from them for good
reasons
so those are your core exercises but if
the client says let's i don't have a lot
of time today
you know you go more to the direction of
efficiency and away from sfr and if a
client's like hey i've got like five
days to train with you this week
i really want to blast my biceps or
whatever you know efficiency takes a
back seat
and sfr takes a front row seat but at
the end of the day sftr
hard to beat when it's best on
everything and another way of thinking
about is this
maybe you don't want to so much collect
good sftr exercises
is you want to excise bad sftr exercises
um i'll give you a really good example
one legged stance bosu ball cable
tricep extension okay takes a ton of
time to set up a ton of time to teach
you gotta like each set takes a ton of
time because they do a wrap and they're
like
oh you gotta fix that and then do
another rub oh so not only is the
stimulus crappy
but the fatigue is pretty high because
they have to really try and it's just
like super exhausting
to have to stand on one leg there's
nothing to do with tricep growth by the
way and it's super exhausting mentally
because you got to focus a lot like
really takes a lot out of you which
clients misinterpret as effect it's not
and at the same time you know it takes
forever to set up forever to do
so it's just the worst right so instead
of maybe collecting these golden
exercises because lots of exercises are
good sfdr
for sure you should look at some
exercises or types of exercises be like
this is the worst sftrs
i really have to be pressed to include
these at
all lastly summing
all of this up hard gainers with high
mrvs
what should they do if they have lots of
free time high astral stimulus exercises
almost always bodybuilders
why do they do this specific technique
and isolation work usually to maximize
sfr whether they know it
uh you know explicitly or not why do
crossfitters do lots of antagonist
compound supersets to maximize str
got a limited time in the gym gotta hit
it hard and
when you're constrained on time and
recovery the highest sftr exercise is
the best and conversely
low sftr exercises are just generally a
stupid idea
to begin with whatever you want out of
your program you got to choose the
exercises and training methods
that get you there there is no best
exercise but there are a group of best
exercises
for your specific needs and your
specific situation and
lastly huge point and the last point
this series of concepts for example the
sfr
applies to all methods and techniques
you can literally take two training
methods
rep schemes set schemes um loading
schemes
warm-up styles arrangements of exercises
and rank the two of them on sfr against
each other
find out which one's better techniques
leg pressing with your feet like this
versus like this for you is going to
have a different stimulus and fatigue
ratio because it's going to hit your
quads more or less
it's going to hurt your joints more or
less right or disrupt them to some
extent
it's not just exercises all of training
essentially
can be ranked on sfr str and raw
stimulus
you don't have to formalize these
concepts you don't have to do math give
them some thought though and just be
aware of it with both yourself and your
clients
are we causing a robust stimulus are we
paying too high of a fatigue cost or are
we doing a good job
making sure the fatigue is low and when
we're time constrained are we making
sure to pick the right exercises
and the right methods to make sure our
time is spent in a very efficient manner
folks do some thinking about this one
thanks so much for tuning in we'll see
you next time
