[Music]
youtube
this is zane this is jake they are both
in the realm of 700 to 800 pound raw
squatters
that ain't me
but these gentlemen are not used to
bodybuilding work and they're not used
to reps how not you stood are they we're
going to find out because we're going to
train quads we are going to do hack
squats and then we're going to do belt
squats and we're going to do the maya
rep style high reps
vomiting blood regret you guys ready
ready i'm gonna be let's do it boom
[Music]
even lower and take a nice one second
pause at the bottom it's gonna feel
weird on your knees for a bit and then
it's gonna feel better
this is gonna be hard
this
yeah
i can tell hack squats these guys are
seven 800 pound squatters they almost
never do machines just free weight and
the way they squat they load their
glutes a ton they load their adductors a
ton and they load their quads a lot not
as much as the hack squat does so we're
gonna see that they're not using a ton
of weight and also ps they never really
go over sets of like five to ten this is
going to be sets of 10 to 20. the
brutality begins
now

problem so now we are gonna do belt
squats and that's gonna be fun probably
three maybe four sets here high reps my
reps belt spots are ideal for my reps
because there's almost no loading on the
spine which means if you get tired you
can simply hang out for a sec and then
go again quad focused these guys are
used to the belt squat unlike the hack
squat we'll see what happens let's do it
