hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization nutrition
myths series video number five
the best diet juicy
let's get into it we're going to talk
about the claim that there is such thing
as best diet what exactly claim is
why it's wrong what grains of truth
there might be to something like that
and then of course best practices so you
actually learn something instead of just
hear me talk smack
so the claim of the best diet is that
there is one
optimal diet for everyone and it's
usually very specific
and it's going to hack your body for the
best possible results
of course you'll need to buy my new york
times bestseller book
to really learn about the diet it's
19.99 but come on now we're all pretty
wealthy by historical standards
here's the thing though big pharma big
business
big beef is going to try to stop you
from learning the truth
so be a brave warrior of this new world
and buy my book
because they're the secret diet magic
diet the serendipitous diet the
synergistic diet
that makes you whole it cures all the
diseases
it makes you lean and jacked and adds
body fat if you want
it does everything great all you need to
do is buy my book
this stuff happens all the damn time
watch
random episodes of dr oz or oprah and
there's another motherfucker on there
with that diet book that's hacking
everything
right and it can sure seem appealing
because look a lot of you guys have
watched this channel
your hardcore fitness folks you already
know it's bullshit here's the thing we
all started somewhere
and regular people that need an answer
to like how the hell do i eat so i'm
healthier and leaner etc and look better
uh you know when someone says especially
someone phd after their name or md
doctor this person that elite athlete
when they say like look i've got the
blueprint for this ultimate diet
that's tempting you're like holy shit
but here's the answer right like if
if bill gates says like hey i've got
this amazing computer program that'll
help you organize all your files
you're not like bullshit that's a it's a
it's a scam
like you're like yeah that's great like
microsoft windows it's amazing
it's giving us like a you know second
renaissance of civilization
awesome but in the diet world sometimes
there are good solutions
sometimes there aren't and a lot of
times it's bs but it's really really
tempting bs so
why is this wrong couldn't there be an
optimal diet for everyone well here's
the thing diets depend on fundamental
principles like calorie bounds
nutrient allocation macro ratio so on
and so forth
and these principles can be applied in a
very wide effective range
people say how much protein do i need
well it depends on who you are
and even if you're a competitive
bodybuilder there's a pretty big range
there that's okay there's a low end and
a high end and a lot
of room in between so if someone says i
have a perfect diet eat this much
protein
automatically they're missing a lot of
nuance in which you're like what if i
eat 90 of that
like that's actually totally cool what
if you eat 110
that's totally fine too and all of a
sudden like so there is no perfect diet
there's a range of principles that as
they intersect there's a really big venn
diagram circle in the middle that
includes all the good stuff about
dieting
and turns out there's a lot of right
answers and that's really the reality
right in addition to that that's just
general
depending on situations diets can alter
significantly and then in that local
area of application can become the best
or better diets
but they're not universally better right
like you guys know from
maybe playing like uh shoot em video
games or whatever like
you could say what's the best gun in
this video game to use is it the sniper
rifle
is the grenade launcher or is it like
the knife like well
you know if you're in a super dark
hallway that's super cramped like the
knife is better than either one of those
two because if you shoot off the grenade
launcher or you just blow up and the
sniper rifle you can't aim
from a thousand feet on a perch the
sniper rifle is the best and when you
have like tanks and crazy zombies coming
at you and they're 50 feet away the
grenade launcher so it's not actually an
answer to the question of what's the
best gun on the video game
but like if someone who doesn't play
video games sits down with you and
you're a super gamer and they're like
what's the best gun you're like uh
it depends on where you are just the
same way with dieting for example
individuals okay some people are
involved in different activities
some people are different sizes
different shapes different food
tolerances depending on the individual
dietary recommendations can absolutely
change so if you write that stupid new
york times bestseller book of like this
is the exact diet
some of this is just not going to be
right depending on who you are right
imagine describing the best diet for
ronnie coleman
and you're 120 pound 45 year old
housewife reading it you're like oh
interesting 400 grams of protein a day
on it and all of a sudden you're like
what the hell am i doing right
different needs different needs at
different times or like the best massing
diet is not the best cutting diet
they can't both possibly be the same
best diet there's one of them radically
different calories in another
special situations like if you have
celiac disease or something like that
if you're allergic to a bunch of stuff
you can't possibly eat this diet that
people say is amazing
right and magnitude of goals like the
best diet for someone with
aspirations to become world's strongest
man except they weigh 270 pounds is the
diet that takes them sort of more or
less on a wiggling path
to 400 but that's not the best diet for
an endurance athlete that weighs 170 it
needs to weigh 145 right so all of a
sudden
all the stuff with different situations
goes out the window and there is no real
best diet
in addition and this is a really really
big point adherence is massive
in the real world there is the
hypothetical of what a best diet could
supply you
nutrients wise timing wise if you did it
and to the extent that you did it
and then that real world also has the
consideration of
to what extent will you do it okay so
if i give you the world's fastest car
but it requires a race car driver's
ability to understand how to actually
use well
you're better off with like a ford
mustang or something that you're like oh
i stick shift and i
actually know how to do this and you can
actually go 120 in that car versus if i
give you a super exotic race car
you go up to 140 and you're like holy
shit and you just crash the thing
because you have no idea how to operate
right so adherence the ability to stick
to something and actually use it
varies and some people do better with
some kinds of diets than others
some people adhere better to high carbs
some do better with low carbs some two
meals a day some
six meals a day some people love to eat
diets with lots of raw fruits and
veggies and some people it just doesn't
go down they look at a piece of broccoli
and they're like crap can i saute this
because i'm not eating
if the optimal diet causes you poor
adherence it's no longer the optimal
diet in real life so you can't really
tell someone like no this is the right
diet but
if you're not going to do it it's not
going to work yeah sure that goes as far
as it does
it doesn't go far enough a real optimal
diet
takes into account what is possible what
is able
right like if aliens give us a gift of
optimal technology
from their own society and it's this
rubik's cube bullshit that we can't
figure out
well aliens aren't that smart because
optimal would be like to actually
improve our society now if it was a
rubik's cube shit that came up and had
an easy menu of like improve society
reduce crime that would be sweet but it
actually has to be usable
so anytime you give someone diet advice
and you think you know the optimal diet
make sure you figure out what is
probably going to be something they do
and then the optimal turns into the
realistic interns to actually affecting
them
in a beneficial way versus just like
well if you could do it it would be
amazing
right now there are grains of truth to
where this idea comes from
there are definitely extremes of dieting
which probably suck
or fairly suboptimal for almost everyone
for example
ultra low carb forever is needlessly
restrictive it causes cravings
it screws up your social life it's
probably not a good idea to do
for almost everyone there are exceptions
to these and if you want to comment on
youtube that you're an exception
go to town but remember the exceptions
are fine for most people ultra low carb
is stupid
carnivore diet it just seems like
randomly taking food groups out for no
reason
probably not a great idea for most
people insufficient
diets with insufficient protein or
micronutrients or something like that
so if you're a fruitarian you only eat
fruit you're taking in 10 grams of
protein a day
bad news but there's not really a
universe in which that diet is a good
idea for anyone in the long term
and then other weird dietary things like
um
eating ten times a day like some diets
are like you gotta eat every two hours
like which
you but you don't actually gotta eat
every two hours it's really more like
a real high pressure situation of a
competitive bodybuilder maybe every four
or you could make an argument that four
is better than five in that situation
and then
there are some caveats there that maybe
even that's too extreme but if someone
tells it like you have to eat ten times
a day really small portions they're just
wasting your time
right so there's diet extremes which are
no good which means that when you tell
someone here's the optimal diet
if your optimal diet is general enough
it just exists in that universe of
things that are all pretty good ideas
and outside of that there are definitely
distinct bad ideas right
and staying away from these extremes
probably
gives a lot of the best diets a lot of
common ground for example
most of the best diets or the ones that
work well in real populations
have plenty of whole foods those whole
foods are super healthy and super great
they just have all these pluses and very
few minuses
lots of veggies fruits grains lean
proteins most of the diets that work
really well are built
core into those at least some of those
uh and very
uh not so many foods outside of that
realm
diets emphasize healthy fats okay
they're really really good and a lot of
the best diets have healthy fats
emphasized
moderate meal timing which is to say not
like one meal a day which most people
can't sustain and not like 10 meals a
day which most people can't sustain but
like you know
a diet that is two to two to five meals
per day for most people is something
they're going to be able to do maybe
even two to four
and diets with similar daily meal
patterns so basically like
it's not like one day you eat once at 2
pm and the next day you eat 10 times
and the other day you just randomly eat
and if it's your macros usually diets
which have a distinct like hey in the
morning you wake up and after x amount
of time you generally eat
and you generally eat a lunch and then a
dinner and then a late night snack
the human body loves consistency
especially with food and sleep
so diets that are regular are usually
better than not so if you have
this as a universe of good dieting most
of these practices float in there and
there are there are diets in there
without these practices but they're few
and far between so we say there's no
such thing
as the optimal diet that's totally true
but there is such a thing as a better
diet and a worse diet
and a lot of the better diets tend to
look pretty similar so
just the same way as you could say
there's no such thing as the optimal
nfl football player because you have
different positions and stuff like that
different physiques
that's true but if you're like no
offense by the way i'm really short
if you're like five one and 120 pounds
it's not
you're not really in that universe of
the diverse of good football player
okay and if you're like seven foot three
and 130 pounds you're definitely not in
that universe you're just gonna get
broken in half
so while it's not true to say there is
an optimal football player physique
there is a distinct range of physiques
which are really good at football and
there's definitely some outsides there
that
just probably aren't that good right so
what do we
do with all this how do we take all this
and actually put it into practice
when you're choosing your own diet it
can be an exploratory process over long
a period of time of choosing diets with
those
good diet features that we talked about
earlier so
from the grains of truth like diets that
are higher in protein
uh lots of healthy fats lots of
unprocessed ingredients you can pick and
choose and make your own diet from those
good inclusion points
and all of a sudden you have a really
really good thing going right so
yeah you should be focusing on the
grains of truth that are kind of more or
less universal for all diets
hell shameless plug you can even try the
rp diet we have the rp diet coach app
or you can read the book and make your
own diet it's totally cool
now i need money folks i need to buy a
lamborghini on my old lamborghini it's
just like you know who has a 1990s lambo
anymore i live in vegas i gotta have the
finest pay me money
but on a serious note totally kidding um
only if you like you can check out the
app
it's not magic other diets work super
great give it a shot if not no big deal
um and here's the deal app no app
whatever always keep an open mind
focus on principles of dieting like am i
meeting my macros is my calorie balance
good am i fundamentally eating healthy
foods
versus names and exactitudes be like
well this this zany
crazy diet that just came out and dr
what's his name says it's great and has
exactly this ratio of foods
that kind of stuff stay away from
because that's almost certainly bullshit
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
time
