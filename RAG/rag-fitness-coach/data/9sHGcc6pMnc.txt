hey folks
dr mike israel here lecture three
in muscle gain nutrition timing
food composition and supplements sounds
like a lot of stuff to put in one
lecture
it's actually not a terrible amount
because basic nutrition has this all
covered already
this is more specifically as to how this
stuff is altered in the muscle gain
sphere
so what are we going to be talking about
today well we're going to be talking
about nutrient timing
basics for muscle gain uh how we're
supposed to think about muscle gain
nutrient timing it's
actually a little bit different than fat
loss and a little bit different than
maintenance not much
then we're gonna talk about protein
composition for muscle gain
carb composition for muscle gain that
what kinds of carbs you should be eating
fat composition for muscle gain muscle
gaining supplements
hydration for muscle gains that's more
of a sentence than it is a slide
and that's that so let's get right into
it
nutrient timing basics for muscle gain
super important points
point number one
fractional breakdown rate is what makes
us lose muscle and we know that's a
normal part of the turnover process
but if it's needlessly elevated that's
not good because remember the balance of
fractional synthesis
has to be higher or as much higher as
possible than fractional breakdown
so anytime that fbr fractional breakdown
rate is elevated we're not such big fans
of this
so we're not definitely going to try not
to go really long time without eating
anything
because that's how you lose muscle there
was a fad a couple months ago actually
called anabolic fasting
folks it doesn't make any damn sense so
enough about that
next time here's the deal fractional
synthetic rate
is actually internally measured rate of
muscle growth
in the actual muscle itself and
it actually can rise by itself with no
food present
because then amino acids are shuttled
from other places usually other skeletal
muscles that don't have such high fsr
curves
so basically the muscles you're not
currently experiencing a lot of turnover
in maybe let's say you trained legs
days ago and you trained arms yesterday
uh
the muscles in your legs will actually
be broken down amino sent into the
bloodstream to supply the higher fsr
curves for muscle
well that's when fsr is elevated but not
being supplied by aminos
from the gastrointestinal tract in other
words when you're not eating
and there's not amino acids coming from
the gi tract relatively regularly
your body is still going to grow muscle
so to speak but it's going to grow some
muscles at the expense of others
it's a zero-sum game it's actually
negative some game right because it's
not a perfectly efficient process
so in other words what we're talking
about here is anytime fsr is elevated
or there's the potential to grow muscle
we're going to want to supply that
process with the amino acids
from the gastrointestinal tract
otherwise we're just not going to get
very far
so that's two points so far in favor of
the idea that we need to like sort of
consider timing at least to some extent
so just eat food is not good enough
advice another point
there's a concept called the leucine
threshold and here's what it is if
you're not familiar with it
a certain amount of the amino acid
leucine seems to
possibly need to be present in a single
meal
for that meal to be able to so
cause signal for muscle protein
synthesis to be as high as possible
right and the leucine thresholds per
body weight but you know there's some
standard
measures it's not difficult to figure
out but essentially
you're going to have to have a real good
bolus of high quality protein in every
meal
right and that might have to happen
relatively regularly for you to max out
anabolism an
interesting implication of that is that
potentially if you eat a little bit of
protein all the time you never get this
bump in leucine high enough to go over
the threshold
you might not grow as much muscle as
possible we're going to talk about later
how that's a little bit
uh unlikely to be very powerful in fact
um
and well we'll just cover it now here's
the deal the leucine threshold has a
couple of decent studies to support it
in
just real simple models where they give
folks like a whey protein shake and if
it's not big enough in size it doesn't
seem to trigger much muscle growth well
that's in a very isolated condition of
you not eating around the clock
what happens let's say if you just even
just four meals per day but they're
hypercaloric meals right so their
hypercaloric day
you kind of have amino acids slow down
in their digestion
and their absorption of the gi tract by
carbs by fats by fibers
by a lot of protein itself and the meals
sort of
bleed into each other in a sense that
you're always getting an almost
even secretion of nutrients from the
gastrointestinal tract into the
bloodstream so it kind of violates the
leucine threshold by itself because you
never have this huge spike
of leucine or anything else in the
bloodstream if you eat like a normal
person trying to gain weight you're not
drinking like a whey protein shake every
six hours or something like that
so if the leucine threshold was super
powerful you wouldn't expect a ton of
muscle growth in
normal eating of you know four to six
meals per day of lots of food
the thing is you do actually get that
effect so the leucine threshold
is a very interesting idea that
potentially has some merit to it we're
not going to put a ton of stock into it
it does however
have some potential so it is worth
mentioning all right
so if we take all these things together
we want to make sure fractional
breakdown rate doesn't excess if we want
to supply fsr curves and we might want
to give the leucine threshold some
thought
anything under four meals per day just
simply doesn't take full advantage of
gain potential people ask
can i eat three meals a day and
gain maximum amount of muscle
maximum no a lot sure but especially if
you're advanced
it just leaves too many fractional break
uh
breakdown windows open it doesn't fully
supply fsr and it has some losing
threshold problems as well
on the other hand if you're eating more
than seven times per day
it's probably overkill because you get
no added benefit
at four at four to six meals a day we're
already filling all of the fbr
gaps pretty much and we're supplying all
the fsr
opportunities and uh the leucine
threshold thing actually becomes
potentially a problem with seven meals a
day because your intake is so
smooth that it's never over the leucine
threshold not a ton of stock in that
part
but seven meals per day even if it might
not be slightly sub-optimal which it
could be
it's certainly like pointless right so
like you know if you want to eat eight
meals a day you can
but i think a lot of folks especially in
bodybuilding talk themselves into
thinking that meal frequency is like an
infinitely good thing
remember there are no infinitely good
things so you know i eat every three
hours that's good man if i eat every two
hours it'll be great well it turns out
there's damn near no difference between
the two
and whatever difference there might be
actually might be in the negative
slightly so
definitely a seven as a top cut off i'll
put you this way if someone's eating
more than seven meals a day they have
better have a really really good reason
for it right
so easy take-home point four to seven
recommended meals per day
is uh is the take-home uh that's it
that's just uh so if you're again trying
to gain muscle
and you're eating less than four meals
or greater than seven meals per day
especially less than four meals per day
you're going to be running into some
trouble right now
the number of meals per day doesn't
answer the question of how we should
spread the meals technically there's all
sorts of nutrient timing
and this is one of them is how do you
spread the meals right
is it like you know if someone has a
meal at 8 a.m a meal at 9 p.m a meal at
10 p.m
or sorry you know at 10 a.m so on and so
forth every
hour and then doesn't eat for 16 hours
but sort of technically
you know four or five meals per day if
you have them in the first four or five
hours well
we want a roughly even spread of meals
for for best effects why because we want
to make sure we fill in all those
fractional breakdown rate gaps
and supply the fractional synthetic rate
gaps right or the
fractional synthetic grade opportunities
you know if you're
really supplying all that stuff and the
first eight hours of the day
within 16 hours of the day you just
don't eat it all all we're going to do
is we're going to take out like a
highlighter and
circle this incredibly high fractional
breakdown rate you have
and then circle that same area be like
where is the amino acids coming for the
fractional synthetic rate curves that
are
on at that time you're just not going to
be able to answer that question right a
lot of times
you know folks that are real big
advocates in sort of all situations of
intermittent fasting
i think it's extremes we'll say when you
got you've got fast and you've got to
eat
you say well when we're fasting for 16
hours i mean how is that maximizing
muscle growth they'll say well it is
trust me and then you're like well let's
just get more technical
how is it supplying the fbr curve fsr
curve and they just really can't answer
those questions
they almost never do they just call you
a shill or something i don't even know
i don't talk to people who weigh less
than 120 pounds i'm just kidding folks
that's a terrible joke
i don't talk to anyone at all because i
have no friends so
what about per nutrient we know it's
evenly spread meals
but are all the meals the same for
protein the answer is pretty much yes
so you don't want to have a meal usually
that has like 80 grams of protein
and then a meal later 10 grams of
protein right those technically are two
meals right they might have some carbs
and fats in them but here's the problem
at 80 grams of protein for the average
sized individual it definitely
bloods fractional breakdown rate almost
completely it definitely supplies any
fsr you need but it
has like 40 grams of protein extra above
that that does what well protein
when it's not going to fbr curves or fsr
curves
anywhere in the body just gets oxidized
it just gets used for energy and then
you're like all right so i just
pissed away like 40 grams of my daily
protein intake on just literally nothing
your body just burns it off right
remember there is no storage form of
protein in the body so then
what's better well so so what's bad
about the 10 gram situation well you
know four hours later you eat a meal
with 10 grams of protein
10 grams not enough to fully mute fbr or
not enough to prevent muscle protein
breakdown greatly not enough to supply
fractional synthetic rate curves
uh gee that's like that's really not
good right that's not really a meal you
can call it a meal but it's not anabolic
and it's true sense
so if we take the the you know the a the
10 and the 80
and we just do two meals of 45 boy we
the both meals check
all the boxes and don't check any of the
boxes we don't need to be checking so
we're maximizing protein efficiency
which is why protein should be spread
roughly evenly between each meal
carbs carbs are not the same when there
is a storage form of carbohydrate in the
body there's actually several there's
blood glucose there's liver glycogen and
there's muscle glycogen at least and
there's other couple smaller ways
so carbs can actually be timed in
relation to training
so carbs pre-workout are important
because it's been shown time and time
again that pre-workout carbohydrates
potentiate high levels of performance
it tops off glycogen stores and what
that does is it makes the workout
literally more anabolic right triggers
more muscle growth which is
awesome right so you don't want to
especially in muscle gaining have a a
low carb or no carb pre-workout meal
it's not a very good use
um of your you know maximizing anabolic
potential
carbs during the workout on a fat loss
diet they could potentially be
important because they're anti-catabolic
and they provide a lot of energy
especially for harder workouts that are
over an hour long
the thing is when you're on a surplus
especially when you're eating a higher
carbohydrate diet like we covered in the
last lecture
man you know a pre-workout 150 grams of
carbs or something two hours before you
train or
you know something you know even 70 or
80 for someone that's smaller
boy that's just going to give you carbs
for hours on end
and if you start the workout with
basically full glycogen stores you
probably just don't
need an intro workout shake nearly that
bad it's
fine to have one but it's not a make or
break it sort of thing
because you're also preview next point
is
going to be smashing post workout carbs
so you do tons of pre-workout tons of
post-workout like unless your workout
takes like three hours
you probably shouldn't you just don't
need intra-workout carbs now the thing
is
can you have them totally to make you
feel better absolutely is that a fine
way if your gi tract can handle it
for you to smash in more carbs through
the day absolutely easy liquid carbs
but it's not something like you know
you're someone who's gaining mass is
struggling you look at them and you go
you got
you got an intra-workout carb shake and
they're like no you're like
there's your fucking problem that's
you're doing wrong that's almost
certainly not it because
there's so much carb saturation it
spills right over into the workout
absolutely
now what about fats the recommendation
here is to keep them low around the
workout window
that is inconvenient especially in
pre-workout right
because we got a lot of fats to eat
potentially and just a lot of food
why the hell is it we're surplus right
why are we saying keep fats away from
stuff
geez we're supposed to be eating all the
time what happened well the thing is
if you have a lot of fats in your
pre-workout
fats are more difficult to digest they
make everything
in the meal digest slower
and what that can potentially do and
they take longer to digest right
what that can potentially do is you ate
a meal usually
three hours before but then you
multiplied the amount of fat in the meal
by three right so it went from 15 grams
of fat
100 grams of carbs 50 grams of protein
to all that uh 50 grams of protein 100
grams of carbs that's 45 grams of fat
let's say
all of a sudden your meal is normally
pretty well digested by the time you
start training three hours later it's
not even close to half way digested
and you have a ton of food in the gi
tract the thing is
your body is pretty good at prioritizing
and when it loses a lot of blood from
the gi tract and goes to the working
muscles
it's going to go oh yeah we basically
have rotting food in the gi tract
because nothing's happening to it
we can't take the nutrients away
digestion slows down like crazy a lot of
times you'll get real
nasty stomach upset and if you push it
further you'll just throw up
right so all of a sudden if you eat too
much especially too many fats
pre-workout
you can put yourself in a situation
where your performance is hampered
and then i'll remember you know you're
trying to eat the food not throw it up
you know
throwing up calories don't count towards
muscle building so it's a really bad
deal
especially on a surplus as a concern
look on a fat loss diet
especially deep into the diet you're so
depleted you're so hungry you could eat
half a pizza and go work out and the
pizza will just burn
right through you'll probably feel great
when you're super stuffed and i mean
days worth of food backed up
on a mass gaining diet it's real tough
to eat a lot before you train and
fats especially all the culprit here
probably try to minimize them
in order to supply uh the fractional
breakdown rate curve
and fsr curve throughout night time
uh we need to be ideally having at least
part of the night uh supply of amino
acids
how do we do that well a high protein
meal in the evening
and preferably slow digesting we'll get
into that slow digesting part in food
composition so that's definitely another
check mark
all right so that is nutrient timing
basics
pretty straightforward stuff let's move
on to
protein composition basics for muscle
gain
so really what kind of protein should we
be eating to try to maximize muscle
remember
food composition accounts for roughly
five percent of the difference in muscle
gains it's really really small stuff
we're talking about here but listen
you know you don't watch a lecture or
take a course on muscle gain nutrition
without wanting the nitty gritty kind of
stuff that can make a difference in
higher level athletes
warren hardgainer so here's all the good
stuff right
first point higher quality proteins
right and they can be ranked in a
variety of indices and it's very very
easy to find this information
protein quality usually is composed of
how much
more are the like the ratio of amino
acids in a protein
how similar are they to the ones in your
body specifically in muscle
and how easily are they digested and how
completely are they digested
so like if you're consuming protein
that's like super awesome and
potentially makes you jack but your body
can only digest half of it
gee that's not a very high quality
protein on the other hand if you consume
a protein
that is pretty you know all of it's
digested but the amino acids got like
way up like a ton of methionine and just
very little leucine
that doesn't tend to trigger anabolism
as much and remember we need a good
spectrum of amino acids roughly even
amounts
of most of them especially ones that
reflect muscle tissue to get the best
effect
so those two elements combined usually
form what's called protein quality
proteins higher in protein quality are
generally better for gaining muscle
especially if you have a diet
that biases you way away from higher
quality proteins then you're going to
feel the effect to some extent
what does that mean well the highest
quality proteins tend to be uh
dairy proteins uh whey protein is a
great example of that but milk proteins
of all kinds are excellent quality
and egg proteins are just plain old
superior they're just really really good
right they used to rank protein quality
on a 0 to 100 scale and 100 was scaled
on the egg
right the egg white was 100 equality
that was the high score you could get
until they really tested whey protein
and they realized it scores better than
100
it actually digests better and supplies
better anabolism
uh so that protein quality is actually
like 10304
right bonus points so dairy whey egg
really really good stuff and the thing
is
if we're getting real picky almost all
meats
including fish and poultry they score in
the high 90s
right so like it was just excellent
excellent protein quality for meats
on the plant side soy seitan
and mycoprotein microprotein's a pretty
recent addition it's actually a fungal
protein
they actually score really high in the
90s and they're very complete proteins
and they're
very very uh really pretty good um not
quite as great as meats and dairies but
really really splitting hairs there
they're really really awesome choices
there are some other complete proteins
like quinoa that come from grains
and various complementary proteins like
beans and rice together
that vegans of vegetarians tend to eat
they don't score super great on protein
quality
they're okay but nothing to write home
about and then there are incomplete
plant proteins which don't offer you all
the amino acids you need which is why
they're called incomplete
and they're usually very poorly digested
so for example
if memory serves the protein gluten
everyone's favorite right it comes in
from wheat
you know gluten actually has a
a protein digestibility and amino acid
score of like
25 or something or 25
which basically means that if you eat
like 100 grams of gluten which if you're
gluten sensitive you'll probably die
um just kidding maybe you will i have
actually no idea uh you're gonna have
really upset stomach so uh you know if
you eat 100 grams of protein let's say
from bread
right because you know bread has like
it's five grams of protein per slice in
some of these breads
oh sweet protein you don't quite count
that the same way if you're really
trying to get jacked
because if you eat like 100 grams of
that stuff really like
something like half of it just straight
up doesn't digest just goes right
through you
and something like half of that whatever
you do digest just won't end up in
muscle tissue at all because it's such
such asymmetrical levels of amino acids
so basically
we're not going to rely on plant
proteins a ton if we want our best
results right
but what happens if we are a vegan or of
someone who just doesn't eat a whole lot
of animal protein
super morally defensible positions
really awesome it's great for the
environment all that stuff what do you
do
well if you're vegan vegetarian or eat
very little animal pro
protein you want to take your macros
remember we said about a gram of protein
is good uh you probably want to eat more
like 1.5 grams of protein per pound per
day
is that harder for people that are
vegans and vegetarians because
they don't have super readily available
protein sources like meats and dairy
yeah it totally is harder but if you're
on a mission for mass
you got to do what it takes so higher
protein intake number two
and and a good way to do number one is
to supplement
with a high quality powdered protein
there's a variety of vegan vegetarian
protein powders
that are engineered to be composed of
relatively high quality protein that's
much more easy to digest
it's sort of ultra filtered and it's
much
higher quality and people say well you
know i don't want to take supplements
well you know
the vegan vegetarian diet is a very
artificial diet because most humans are
not vegan vegetarian they're really sort
of
designed to be vegan vegetarian they're
designed in some cases to consume animal
products to boost their protein intake
and what you're doing as a vegan
vegetarian is living an artificial
lifestyle that's actually
very good for your health and probably
very good for the planet and super good
for animal suffering so you're gonna
have to go out of your way a little bit
and do some other artificial stuff to
make up for it
and one of those is to supplement with a
high quality protein powder which can
also still be vegan a vegetarian
um it just had you know people say like
well i want to be a vegan okay
perfect i want to get jacked okay sweet
uphill battle but you got it and like
but i don't want to take any supplements
it's like gee you know you're really
just you know
sticking into yourself at that point and
you know
even if you do or don't do all these
other things you want to eat as much of
the complete high quality vegan protein
as you can so mico protein
plenty of soy all that good stuff quinoa
even don't just um
sort of rely on a beans and rice combo
to get you all the protein you need
uh as a vegan vegetarian or a low meat
eater because it's just
you know yeah you can do it but it's not
going to be best for muscle gain and
here's
another concern if you don't supplement
especially
or eat these really high quality sources
the amount of plant protein you'll have
to eat
to counteract the poor digestibility and
absorption is going to have to be like 2
to 2.5 grams per day
at that level of protein first of all
your gi tract is going to be having all
sorts of fun with just the protein alone
but also because you're taking it from
plant sources your fiber levels can get
so high
you more or less just turn into a human
volcano but upside down
if you can figure out what i mean by
that so it's not great i would really
recommend supplementing and
doing what it takes to make sure you
still get high levels of protein
all right number two
nutrient of importance macro is carbs so
how do we do carbs uh with muscle gain
well we know that we have to eat a lot
of carbs probably
um where should those carbs come from
well it's pretty much a fact that
veggies fruits and whole grains
are the best for health
here are some downsides though for mass
gaining downsides not totally right off
but some trade-offs
veggies fruits and whole grains are
really filling which makes them almost
ideal for fat loss because they keep you
full while
limiting your calories but from us again
g you know if you're let's say a 200
pound
athlete you're consuming 300 grams
of carbs per day you can do it all in
veggies and fruits
in whole grains and not bad and i would
be super awesome and you'd be super
healthy and be super fun
you start to push into the 600 gram of
carb per day range and above
man it's tough to just stuff yourself
with that much food first of all second
of all
on a hypercaloric diet with a high level
of carbohydrate
you might be getting into levels of
fiber if you choose to eat mostly
veggies fruits and whole grains
that is actually potentially not super
healthy
because the at certain levels of fiber
the fiber actually
pulls as many nutrients as it takes in
into your gi tract
even more so you actually you're not
going to be malnutrition but you might
not get the best nutrient absorption
and boy oh boy the human volcano bad as
ever right you already poop a whole lot
when you're mass gaining
if you insist on eating fruits veggies
and whole grains exclusively
and your carbs really start to pile on
if you can even eat that many carbs
you're going to be looking at a real
real nasty gi tract situation right
so i think a consideration here is to
give some thought to just doing a base
of fruits vegetables and whole grains
but consider filling in some carbs when
needed especially when your appetite
gives out
of less fibrous products when you're on
a surplus when you're trying to gain
muscle mass
for example potatoes potatoes have
almost no fiber in them and
they're not exactly super nutrient dense
and they got some nutrients in there but
they're pretty easy to smash down a
whole lot of mashed potatoes right or
just baked potatoes a pretty easy way to
go
white rice right white rice has a bad
rep for not being brown rice and you
know you can only
get in touch with mother gaia her
earthly goddessness
goddessness hood godhood if you um
you know eat only brown rice and if you
order white rice sushi people will judge
you but there's a brown rice menu and
they look at you they think you're
healthy
like there's brown rice if you want
you're like i'm on vacation damn it
right so people think oh brown rice
that's what bodybuilders eat that's what
health people eat
white rice is super nutritious super
healthy is not a damn thing wrong with
it
and also is a lot easier to smash a
whole lot of white rice part
because it has lower fiber you know you
eat 600 grams a day of brown rice
your toilet will be serving overtime
this is technically a
i think you know like a war crime
against your toilet
and certainly other parts of your
anatomy so um
white rice is totally a fine way to go
cream of wheat
some breads are we telling you to eat
like a cotton candy
no but you might want to ease up on the
fiber a bit and listen you don't have to
take my advice give it a shot
and take in all the five recan um call
me in the morning
so to speak or um yeah give
give that a shot and you'll quickly
realize that sort of the
attempt to eat a super healthy on paper
diet
might might backfire a little bit on a
surplus right
so uh and you know this there's this
idea of being married to a class of
healthy carb source
um at rp you know a bunch of folks have
bought our nutritional products and and
a lot of the nutritional products are
sort of template based or
app-based and they really kind of tell
you okay so here's like super healthy
foods you can eat
because most people don't eat enough
super healthy foods and super high fiber
foods right and
a lot of the products recommend a bunch
of veggies with every single meal
which because most of our customers are
fat loss customers right
and even the muscle gain customers a lot
of them are folks that are they weigh
120 pounds and they want to gain up to
130 it's not exactly shovels of food
that they have to eat to do that
they can continue to eat all these
fruits veggies and whole grains be just
fine
um but we don't want to be ideologically
married to the idea that there's
certain good foods and these bad foods
there's foods to do certain jobs and
foods to do other jobs
and if you have to eat 900 grams of
carbs a day you're not going to do it
in pears and and broccoli and quinoa you
you might but
you know the the corners will find you
exploded at your office one day and
would be a really close casket funeral
right but if you try some cream of wheat
some white rice and potatoes thrown in
the mix not everything
could be good so it pays to be
open-minded not just be like sort of
like oh no
so brown rice is healthy i never eat
white rice it's absolutely not how it
works
right especially another really good tip
for carbs
is in the workout window you probably
want faster adjusting carbs
just to get them in get them assimilated
and keep pounding in carbs because
you've got a lot of carbs to eat for
example
in your intro workout shake of course
you're going to have something like
gatorade or dextro super fast adjusting
but after you train you might not want
to put in like you know brown rice
avocado and stuff it's going to take a
while to get all stuff absorbed
maybe a better idea right after training
is some some uh
some cereal right a lot of cereals are
pretty fast digesting and you know like
checks or pops i gotta have my pops
is that the one yes addiction based
commercials
so you know some of those cereals are
really awesome because they're
relatively
um high in uh
really fast digesting carbohydrate you
can smash a ton of them in remember uh
skim milk especially is very insulin
urgent it actually
makes you secrete a little bit more
insulin than the carbs it brings in so
it's kind of like
getting a huge bang for your buck so
maybe take a whey protein shake
put it aside get some cereal milk a big
bowl smash that down that's a really
good start as opposed to just eating
sort of classic healthy
food all the time all right
that's carbs what about fats
well essential omegas
right the fats you can't make by
yourself
uh are essential right essential omegas
are essential meme
and um what you can do is on a mass
gaining diet this is a little bit more
important on a fat loss diet because you
tend to miss some nutrients there
you can absolutely consider taking an
epa dha supplement
or you eat fish like twice a week or
more totally cool
you know if on a mass gain you got a
couple sushi holidays when you go to all
you can eat sushi
buffet a couple times a week that takes
more than care of all that stuff but
it's something to consider
do you need to worry about saturated fat
and take out a muscle gain phase
probably not because just through like
regular animal consumption
um you'll get enough saturated fat so
it's almost not ever a problem right if
you're vegan a vegetarian you might want
to consider you know
some coconut oil and macadamia nuts and
stuff like that you'll get so many of
those fats from those sources it's
really not hard to get saturated fats in
a surplus i wouldn't worry about it
especially if you're an omnivore then
you know gee
just eating any kind of meat whatsoever
gives you almost certainly enough
saturated fat so it's not really a
problem
so this begs the question if essential
fats are
a very small amount like we covered in
the last lecture and
saturated fats are super easy to get in
okay then
we still need more fats where should
these discretionary fats come from
to fill in our fat requirement
monounsaturated sources probably the
candidate number one
examples here nuts nut butters olive oil
canola oil avocado etc things like that
right here's the thing monosaturated
fats have been directly studied
numerous times and they actually just is
all the one of these studies is they
just literally have the same food
and they replace uh the saturated fat
with monounsaturated fat for some of the
groups and not others
some of the individuals and others
monounsaturated fat
high fat diet does a couple of really
really awesome things
right um it actually
has an effect on lean body mass which is
really really impressive
it raises lean body mass it prevents a
rise in fat mass
as fast as you would expect and it does
all kinds of really good stuff
too uh talk about that later um it can
actually reduce uh systemic inflammation
and things like that which is really
awesome
so um if you opt for higher fat eating
especially
right if you're doing a mixed mass
instead of a high carb mass
let's say you know 400 grams of carbs
and 150 fats a day
then definitely consider monos because
it's going to be the healthiest way to
get in fats
and probably the one that's going to
have the best effect on your body
composition
all right supplements time for us to
just push
all the rp supplements in the world get
them now
use discount code rp dr mike
50 i don't know it's 50 cent discount
code that's the only one they gave me
let's take a look
whey protein these aren't necessarily
ranked in order by the way but they're
muscle building supplements worth notion
whey protein is great it's really
anabolic it's really high quality it
works great in workout shakes
is whey protein some kind of magical
thing that just makes you jack no
you have to have enough total protein
during the day that's that's way more
important than the kind but whey protein
is a great way to build up to that
especially
for workout shakes when you can't
exactly eat a piece of meat i suppose
you could eat a piece of meat at a gym
people will think you're strange and
your constant quest
to increase your friends list from zero
to plus zero
will be hampered no less if you start
eating raw steak at the gym
whey protein is great i remember when i
was like 16 years old my parents got
me after a lot of begging a whey protein
supplement
which was i believe chalk was the number
one ingredient
and uh it was i used it i thought it had
pharmacological effects
i used it like two scoops a day and i
was like this is going to change stuff
but
i didn't realize that i could have just
gotten all that uh protein from
from various other product products and
i just had to
take the way around the workout window
oops so it's not magical but it is
fairly effective creatine creatine's
great mass building supplement it really
builds muscle mass
gives you really cool pumps it helps
with recovery a bunch of other stuff
it's probably healthy for you
two and a half grams of creatine
monohydrate per 100 pounds body weight
so if you weigh you know 200 pounds
that's 5 grams of creatine per day
timing's not important you can put it in
your workout shake for convenience days
you don't work out you can just have it
in the morning
i do the old creatine spoonful creatine
spoon to the face
wash down with water been taking
supplements so long i really don't care
you know you really care in the early
days how they go down after a while
just harden up you know you you merely
started taking creatine
i was born in it i don't know that makes
any sense bathtub of creatine
i do that doesn't make sense as soon as
i was born my
my baby body was dipped into powdered
creatine but like like
some kind of punch key or something on
both sides and we get everything i'll
have an achilles heel
you guys know a story about achilles
where they dip him in and it's that's
why his achilles
is the because that's where they grabbed
him why didn't they just dig get him on
his head and dip him again
you know i'm saying i'm just solving
problems for you guys greek mythology
whole busted i was covered in creatine
at birth so i'm actually immortal i'm
like achilles achilles you can consider
this a call out
so whenever you want to do this ghee
nogi i don't care in any case
creatine it works here's the cool thing
about creatine
cool to some people scary for others it
causes a roughly
five to ten pound gain in body water
over about a week when you first start
taking it
if you're a real non-responder low
responder you don't see much weight gain
maybe two pounds
if you're a crazy responder i know one
person individually who gains 10 to 12
pounds every time they start taking
creatine they just like blow up like a
puffer fish
it's not subcutaneous water so you don't
like face doesn't get puffy
your muscles get puffy which is really
sweet it's not sweet if you're not
expecting it
and it's not sweet if you're trying to
attract body weight so if you're trying
to track body weight and we'll talk all
about body weight track in a later
lecture
make sure you're easy with the creatine
know that you're taking it know that the
first week isn't something are you going
to be
examining your weight after the first
week creatine is loaded
then you can start tracking your body
weight it's going to start to make sense
casein protein number three great for
meal replacement great for
protein at night again not magical just
another tool in the toolbox
glycemic workout carbs really great on
mass uh because you know especially for
your shake
intro and post man you know you're sure
as heck not going to be eating food
because you're going to be
so pumped and your gi tract going to be
like i'm not interested in any food it's
very very vomiting on muscle gain phases
so a great a glycemic intra-workout
shake something like gatorade etc really
really
good good stuff really comes in handy
multivitamin just to check the boxes
the thing is you're going to be eating
um tons of healthy food anyway and tons
of food in general you're probably not
going to be deficient on a
muscle gain phase multivitamin is
probably a little bit more important on
a fat loss phase but i would just
take a multivitamin maybe half of
multivitamin year round just as a good
insurance policy so to speak
number six gainer shakes
all right mass gain shakes
are awesome we're going to talk about
them more
in adjusting these things later but i'll
just say this
if you get tired of eating if eating
gets really hard and you're not gaining
weight and you still have to eat more
and you're tall you can't dig any more
food
mask any shakes there are a couple
brands especially or types we'll talk
about that are very effective i've used
them to put on tons and tons of weight
without them i would have been totally
useless and
um we'll talk about what macros we're
looking for
and when to take them we're going to do
a lot of that later but here's a little
quick preview
you want a decent amount of protein in
them super high amount of carbohydrate
specifically glycemic carbohydrate
because i adjust super fast and allow
you to eat really cool
soon after if a masking or shake is
super high in fat
you've got your calories and that's nice
but you might as well have eaten pizza
or something like that like if it's a
high fat shake you might as well get
tastier ways of doing that versus buying
a
like a some kind of powder a gnc a lot
of the shakes you can get though are
super low
fat super high carb moderate protein if
they're super glycemic so they go in and
out
real quick and the best time to take
them usually right in that post workout
period
if you get real desperate and you have
to take two of them a day pre-workout
then you take your normal weigh-in
gatorade in the workout and then
post-workout you can take another mass
gainer shake i've been
the two-a-day mass gainer club and it
worked i put i
went all the way up to 265 pounds that's
the only way i could have gotten a 265
short of eating everything in sight
because uh boy it was tough to eat by
that point but it worked and muscle
gains were real so the thing about
gainer shakes
you know a lot of the sort of internet
wisdom is like don't worry about gators
bro just eat real food
yes that's very good advice if you're
already eating real food if you're
already consistent you still can't put
on weight especially if you weigh more
than 200 pounds
mass candy shakes can be a useful tool
too in the toolbox the big mistake with
mass gainer shakes
is when folks um you know they take a
shake and they think it's got like sort
of pharmacological effects like i did it
i took my shake today and mass gainer
the only thing about the mascara shake
that makes any damn sense is it's high
in calories and it can get those
calories in super quickly
um you know if you eat a mass gainer
shake or you take one
and then like you have a slice of pizza
later that day and then you go to sleep
there's like 1200 calories total you're
not gonna gain any mass right it's not a
magical effect it has to be
on top of a lot of real solid food and
it has to be very very consistent
can you take epa and dha subs yeah we
recommended that earlier it's totally
fine
again your chances of not having enough
essential fats during a muscle gain
phase is really low
but it's worth a thought what about
stimulants people say i'm gaining mass
i gotta train hard i gotta take tons of
pre-workout on the plus side you get to
train harder
it's an okay plus side on the downside
stimulants
one of their very predictable effects is
that they lower appetite sometimes
considerably
and when you're taking like you know
ronnie coleman's
cut stack 5.0 fat burner with 900
milligrams of caffeine or something
crazy in it
boy you're going to really not want to
eat especially in that post-workout
period where you really should be eating
right you come home from work out you're
still like someone's like food you're
like i don't even know why people eat
right
not a good thing so stimulants if you
take stimulants pre-workouts and if you
just drink coffee or whatever regularly
your best bet is to do this don't take a
whole lot of stimulants
on your mass gain phase take very little
on your maintenance phase
and then ramp them up as you go through
the cutting phase through the fat loss
phase
muscle gain phase not the time for tons
of stimulants you want to free up
remember you're going to get a ton of
energy anyway from the tons of food and
tons of recovery you're getting
so you might as well just take your
stimulants and save them for one fat
loss
phase when you need them and the
anti-appetite effect
definitely not a good time for
stimulants if you can go without them or
to the extent that you can
what about hydration you need so much
food in a muscle gain phase
that you are going to get thirsty just
from eating that much food um
don't mess it up big time and you'll be
fine right you know people say like
hydration is critical to muscle gain
yeah and so far as it keeps you alive
and not dehydrated
so you know with each meal that you eat
have like a nice big tall glass of water
or calorie free beverage or even calorie
beverage if you really need to gain mass
like skim milk or something
and then boy you'll be hydrated just
fine just watch your urine color urine
volume
and and you'll be just fine no no no
crazy reason to go to
nuts on hydration folks that covers it
for this lecture
next time we are going to do a very very
interesting lecture
about the ranges of muscle gain
rate right how much weight gain you
should uh
have per week per month whatever and how
long that process should be
for optimal results not too long not
long enough so on and so forth
that's lecture four see you next time
you
