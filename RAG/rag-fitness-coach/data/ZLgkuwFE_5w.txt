welcome back to another episode that was
very excited um in today's episode i
want to discuss a few things first up
stimulant use during the end of prep
my struggles faced over the past few
weeks
my perspective mindset regarding prep at
this point
and finally just give you a live update
on how everything's going
first up stimulant use during the end of
prop
so
i think stimulants can be used
effectively during prep
specifically the two main ones i can
think of right now
would be caffeine and nicotine
most people know that caffeine is a
stimulant and you know most people use
caffeine in some form
whether that's coffee energy drinks
supplements pre-workout what have you
now there are a few reasons why caffeine
can be particularly helpful during prep
the first one is it does likely suppress
appetite to a small extent
as do a lot of stimulants
and so during prep when your appetite is
elevated um having caffeine can help you
stay a bit fuller or at least not eat as
much
which given that during prep one of the
biggest obstacles you'll face is
increased hunger increased caffeine
intake dream prep can help
the second benefit would be
caffeine is technically eager
ergogenic which means it improves
performance in a variety of tasks from
endurance tasks to more strength based
like under max tasks
and just overall it seems to improve
performance in a variety of things not
to a
an insane extent but definitely to a
normal stand
this effect might diminish somewhat with
habitual use but there likely still
remains an effect even when it's
consumed pretty habitually
so that's also useful in prep because
during prep when your aim is to maximize
muscle retention or even gain some
muscle
improving performance with an accession
likely could lead to increased stimulus
and thus increased growth overall
finally the third reason why caffeine
can be helpful is it's a stimulant it
increases motivation to train
and that also impacts stuff like in my
experience at least
your motivation to do work so outside of
training outside of
prep itself
your motivation and energy to do other
things like you know do phd work the
coaching walk um
be doing your laundry doing your chores
and that sort of thing that can also hit
and so having caffeine can help you
combat that and overcome that as well
now there are a few potential issues
with caffeine use during prep
the biggest one probably is sleep
if you don't manage timing and dosages
properly
excessive use of caffeine can definitely
interfere with sleep and bad sleep
to any
meaningful extent will likely
counteract or counterbalance
any positive effects you get from
caffeine in the first place and so
timing your caffeine usage properly and
making sure your doses are adequate is
quite important
now in my case i've used caffeine
during the last maybe 12 weeks of prep
before that i didn't really use it much
i think i used 200 milligrams upon
waking right after waking up and that
was
fine didn't didn't feel asleep at all um
and then around 12 weeks out from the
show so around 10 weeks ago now
i started using it twice per day so once
at around 8 30 am when i get up and once
around 3 pm
that's around 9 hours before my bedtime
which
i
think it at least six hours
before your bedtime if you
consume caffeine
much after six hours before you bedtime
you might be risking some more sleep and
at that point i think it's not really
worth it anymore in my case
i take it at 3 p.m which is 9 hours
before my bedtime and that's been fine
now more recently i would say
the past week or two now so really the
last four weeks before the show
so i was already up to 400 milligrams a
day
but recently i've upped it to on some
days as high as 550 um
in the form of an energy drink usually i
take caffeine pills just for convenience
and price as well it just saves money
but recently with my increased appetite
increased cravings for flavor
essentially
having an energy drink before
my am session has been helpful
um
because at this point as i get into
later training is really burdensome
really hard and i can't get excited for
it at all
but yeah so caffeine usage is an
all-time high it's helped with getting
my steps in it's helped with training
itself it's helped with appetite um
but it is very much a matter of timing
it properly i need to time it properly
in relation to my workouts i need time
properly in relation to my sleep
um
and then that brings me to nicotine
nicotine
has somewhat similar effects to caffeine
it's not used as widely as a supplement
if you ignore smoking and vaping the
like
for prep but i think it's kind of
underrated
um
so nicotine also a stimulant
by itself and gum or lozenges like i'm
taking them right now as we speak
they have a very low addiction potential
like it's very rare they get addicted to
nicotine and in fact they're used as a
replacement therapy for people trying to
quit smoking
and if you look at the evidence on
health side effects from nicotine usage
by itself there's essentially nothing
it's quite
safe as far as supplementation goes
now as far as it affects its effects go
the first one would be and i think the
major one is appetite suppression
so from what i understand again i've
discussed this previously but from what
i understand
the appetite suppression effect is
fairly temporary and once you come off
nicotine it rebounds
so it wouldn't be a long-term weight
loss solution but during prep and i
think during the last month of prep or
so it can be quite helpful
now what's worth noting is nicotine has
a very short half-life i think his
half-life is around two hours which
means pretty regular usage throughout
the day is beneficial
and i've used it in one way which i'll
discuss soon
um but i'd say taking it somewhere
between
three and
ten times per day is probably fine
um
three times if hunger is not really an
issue and up to ten times if you don't
get many side effects and it helps you
out and it doesn't fall asleep
second effect is as with caffeine it
does increase motivation stimulate you
which can be helpful for training for
general life as well just everything
essentially
now
the
downside of nicotine
is too full i suppose
like with caffeine if you take it too
close to sleep it counts asleep
um but this is much less book and sudden
caffeine just because
as i said nicotine's half life is around
two hours versus caffeine's half-life
which is like around
i wanna say
three to five hours ish i can't recall
top of my head but it's definitely
longer um which means you can take
nicotine later on in the day and still
be fine
and the second downside is as i
mentioned it's not really a long-term
weight loss solution because
after you discontinue usage it rebounds
your appetite and you regain a bunch of
that weight most likely or at least
makes it hard enough to regain it
so it's useful for prep but not really
useful for weight loss
now the way i've used stimulants during
this prep has been
caffeine once when i wake up at 8 30 am
and then again at 3 pm
200 milligrams both times
and then one more potential caffeine
drink
before my am session um this just helps
me out with
getting me going in the morning uh
getting some steps in
and just generally making sure i get
through a day because at this point as i
get to now
i am struggling uh with prep so
here's some of the stuff i've faced over
the past few weeks
my energy levels are definitely at an
all-time low um
it's very reminiscent of what depression
was like
except i'm also physically more tired
though it's difficult to delineate
what's the pro what sort of
psychologically induced
um
physical tiredness or
what's actual physiological fatigue
and they're
very difficult to distinguish um
regardless prep has me feeling
as tired and fatigued as ever before
um
besides that hunger all-time high i've
had a few days maybe uh
three or four days in a row where
because of how hungry i was i was having
you know
three or four out of my five meals a day
within the fast like four hours after
waking up which that meant for the rest
of the day i had to
survive with like one meal
and that was because i was so hungry in
the morning that i just couldn't
you know wait up wait around until i was
supposed to be the next meal i just had
to get it done i was still able to track
and
stick to my macros as planned but meal
timing was
worse than usual
and
recently that's how i've been using
nicotine mainly
what i'm doing now is i've got these
meal timings planned out like i'm having
my breakfast around 8 30 then i'm having
my second meal post workout after my
session which is around
um
half past 11 then i'm having my third
meal around 1 p.m and so forth
now how i've been using nicotine to
combat this issue of
eating all my meals early in a day and
then not having any calories left for
rest which is sub-optimal from a variety
of
perspectives from maximizing lack of
general punishment to maximizing muscle
protein synthesis to a variety of things
and even hunger management most likely
it's not really a long-term approach
because you know yeah it helps in the
morning but then you get to 5 pm and
you're storing and you have one more
meal it's not helpful
um so i've been using nicotine now is
as soon as i finish a meal
i take a lozenge of nicotine for me a
lozenge takes around an hour to dissolve
fully on mouth
and during that time you're not supposed
to drink or eat so even if only because
of that it's helped me to not eat and to
sort of delay my next meal by at least
an hour or two
um
plus by the time the lozenge is
dissolved nicotine started to hit me and
i'm less hungry
and because nicotine is also a stimulant
it's
helpful in getting me to stay focused on
my work which distracts me from my
hunger
and helps me do work even while i'm deep
into prep and quite fatigued
and so overall
taking nicotine
one two milligram lozenge after each
meal
has helped me with focusing on work
and with hunger management and making
sure i don't have all of my meals in the
morning which is what's been happening
on a few days recently um as far as
caffeine goes i try and make sure i get
my caffeine in
again 8 30 a.m 3 p.m which is around an
hour before my am session and my pm
session respectively
generally speaking guidelines for
caffeine usage or that you should take
it around an hour before your session
and so that works out quite well
um that's part of the reason why i train
at around 9 30 and
4 pm respectively because it gives me a
bunch of time between sessions enough
time to recover but also because it's
not so late that caffeine usage can then
interfere with sleep
so that's how i've been using well more
sirens i love it um that's how i've been
using nicotine and caffeine lately
nicotine primarily as a sort of
hunger management strategy and caffeine
primarily as a okay let's get off my ass
and go train or do my steps
or get me through a day um
so yeah that's how i've been using those
now
i've also faced other struggles like at
this point
i've experienced a lot of the things
that bodybuilders talk about
in interviews and stuff where as an
outsider you might think they're being
dramatic um i was talking about this
with a friend of mine today
as an outsider you might be thinking oh
these
about how bollywood
the end of prep their food focus is huge
they can only think about food they have
no energy
um
they don't want to do anything they just
want to lie down they get out of breath
easily
i before initiating this prep was
struggling to understand
how that was even the case and
whether people were just being dramatic
having gone through it now
not only do i feel like a much better
coach as far as bodybuilding is
concerned just because i've actually
gone through it i've got that level of
experience of
what it's like um
but i also now realize
all this [ __ ] they talk about it's true
you know um
when i go to bed at night for example
i just see food like when i close my
eyes and try and go to bed for the most
part i just see food um
i think about oh this body part's a
little bit fat or
i need to work on this pose or i think
about the competition itself i think
about how many days are left at this
point i'm so deep into prep and
very exhausted that i have like six
different countdowns in my head from
how many days until the show how many
days of hard training are left how many
hard sessions are left how many lower
body sessions left specifically
how many hard days of dieting i have
left before the peak which is a time
when i get to eat a bit more
um
and it's just draining like it's it's
really hard as i said before prep has
been the hardest thing i've ever done
and so
as much as i've been able to i've tried
to
still focus on my phd still focus on
coaching like still focus on everything
else
because a i don't want to waste this
time i don't want prep to consume my
life
and also
focusing on other areas of my life can
help me
manage my hunger manage my thoughts a
little bit
um
but yeah honestly fatigue hunger food
focus body image issues
irritability
sort of depressive like symptoms fatigue
all of those
are an all-time low slash high
and it's
it's been enough um
this brings me to my
perspective mindset regarding prep at
this point
i definitely want to compete again
bodybuilding for another
two to five years um
a lot of natural bodybuilders straight
up don't compete that often because of
how tiring it is and how much of a
strength can place on your life and you
need to be in a really good spot in life
to compete
this is something i've mentioned in an
interview that's coming out soon
um
but since then i've come to realize it
even more
bodybuilding is not a very lifestyle
friendly sport um
can you recreationally bodybuild and get
pre-lean and you know gain some muscle
hell yeah that's quite convenient
you can fit it into your lifestyle
fairly easily
but bodybuilding to show level
is a very different beast and so the
offseason is where it's at as far as
being accommodating towards your
lifestyle and that sort of thing
and so i don't plan on competing again
in bodybuilding for two to five years
um
at this point as i mentioned i've got so
many countdowns in my head so much sort
of stress and anxiety and whatever with
that
i'm really focusing on taking one day at
a time um winning the small battles like
okay
tomorrow is a new day i'm two weeks out
now as of this recording tomorrow's a
new day
what do i have to do tomorrow's a sunday
i'm gonna do my steps i'm gonna do my
posing
and then for the rest of the day i'm
just gonna sit down and do some work
and you know socialize and all that but
the hardest parts by far of my day now
are
getting my steps in
getting my training in
staying somewhat consistent with me
timing and not going over my calories
and
posing posing at this point is also
quite difficult and effortful and so
i'm focusing on taking one thing at a
time
only doing the main things fast doing
them when i have the most energy so
doing my steps training posing
when i have the stimulants acting up
like
in the morning i take caffeine an hour
for my session go train
try and do my posing pretty close to
that so i have the energy to do so and
then when i have less energy i try and
relax or do some work that's less
physically demanding because at this
point the physically demanding walk is
by far the most challenging
um
so yeah my perspective and mindset we're
going for at this point is to
focus as much as i can taking one step
at a time not think far ahead because i
do i get overwhelmed by the challenges
how much time is left the hunger the
sort of
almost hopelessness regarding the end of
prep how difficult it is
and so if i don't focus on it one day at
a time i get overwhelmed and that's not
helpful in that way it's also quite
reminiscent of depression in that when
you're depressed
something that can happen to you and
what it can feel like is that there's no
hope and there's no end in sight
and that way
prep right now does feel like depression
in a sense
finally i want to give a live update um
the rest of my life as i mentioned
before has definitely suffered as a
result of prep
um not so much during the first 10 to 15
weeks but definitely during the last 10
weeks or so prep
i've still been able to do phd work i've
still been able to do coaching work
coaching is going very well uh i've got
more than mine than that before i'm i
think i'm doing a good job with clients
um i'm doing my best
i
increased prices recently because of how
much demand i've had and because i don't
have that much time to dedicate coaching
and so i want to be able to spend enough
time on each client with each client
to
give each client my best service and
really help them out
so coaching is going really well um
i have planned out my christmas now i'm
going back to
london for four days with family uh as a
christmas gathering and then i'm going
back to belgium to brussels for a week
from the 27th of december to the second
which includes my birthday on the 28th
of december i'm turning 22 years old
um
and it's been fun planning that out
i've also been getting more into cooking
i think
because of how much more food focus i've
experienced over the past few weeks
i'm getting increasingly excited to get
more into cooking once prep is over and
so i've ordered a bunch of cooking wire
ingredients and stuff like that and i
want to get a lot more into cooking um
i've already planned out some meals for
a post show going to a sushi all you can
eat going to a brazilian barbecue all
you can eat going to a variety of
dessert places
i've got it planned out um
obviously most of my meals are going to
be you know very satiating very
micronutrient-dense
meals that i'll make myself at home
but then some meals will definitely be
celebration meals and ultimately if i
plan on regaining 45 kilograms in a
matter of a month initially to get back
to more comfortable body fat and to
you know
put out the fire that was
prep um
then having those higher calorie meals
and enjoying myself is very much
necessary both from a psychological
recovery perspective to sort of
reset myself after all the
pain and suffering to be uh dramatic of
prep
and also from a physiological
perspective to regain that weight that i
lost and getting back to a better place
anyways that wraps up this video
i talked about stimulant use my
struggles that i've faced over the past
few weeks my perspective and mindset
regarding prep at this point and i've
given a general life update on
what i've been getting up to how
coaching is going phd work
and stuff like that
for the future i plan on making a lot
more
how should i put it not clickbaity but
more viewer friendly videos
sort of like 20 second videos about
posing
tutorials or
uh 10 000 calorie challenges or just
like day in the life type of videos i'm
going to try and make some content
that's more long form like the ones i've
been making now with contest prep series
and then some more
accessible less time intensive for the
viewer videos
and yeah more production heavy as well
i'm considering hiring a videographer
and or editor in the future to make that
easier because i don't have that much
time and so
provided income is that to fund it i'll
definitely look into doing that at some
point
anyways that was about it if you enjoyed

i am now two weeks out so stay tuned and
i'll see you again in the next one
