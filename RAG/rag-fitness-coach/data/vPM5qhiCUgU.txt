gather around everyone
hey folks dr mike here charlie john
jarrod feather team full rom
we are training
push but we start with cavs i know gotta
get the cabs going gotta fit him in
somewhere so we're gonna start with
calves on the leg press then we're going
to move into incline smith machine
then
milo reps of cable push downs and then
finally the cambered bar bench press ooh
we i'll talk a whole lot more about each
exercise when we get there let's get it
started i hate kids
kev's is the worst
it's calf raised time
arsenal leg press is amazing and also
doubles
as a calf raise so that's really cool
we are going to do oh
about five or six sets
pretty short rest breaks here for cavs
jared's going to do a set and a half
because his calf mrv is super low
and
yep full range of motion nice little
pauses at the bottom full extension get
the calves done nothing to do with our
push workout just got to train cavs at
some point
and uh here we go uh train cabs is so
much fun
look it's so dynamic and exciting and
you get a pump
where you don't want one
this machine sucks for calves
this is exactly like last prep
where i got anger the cat machines are
sucking
oh i hate this machine
yeah there's really cavs it's like
i mean the we had good calf filming
yesterday or last time because it was
actually like
naked calves and cool positions but this
we're all keeping sweatpants on except
for jared there you go you get that shit
you can put a little thought bubble with
charlie and you just put my calves in
there
it's like sweet
they're so fast twitch i gotta do lower
reps
so i do one leg
so since i'm going to the open
i can actually put
mass on my calves and forearms again
i had to stop training both of them
in my glutes and my quads for two months
this is a classic weight cut off
it was terrible
[Music]
ah
mike's the other one who's tried during
halfway yeah you know who has bigger
cows though you know what i'm saying
mike's are actually pretty big he might
have bigger cats
mine are just really balled up you know
and then i wear these high socks
[Music]
the pushing part of the workout begins
calves are done incline smith machine
press
sets of oh roughly 10 to 15 reps
everyone's auto regulating their load
um let's see how it goes
why smith machine just another tool in
the toolbox it works really well
and takes care of the stability aspect
for you so you can push not better than
free weights probably not much worse
maybe not worse at all
always slowly centric controlled
pause all the way up full range of
motion let's do it
[Music]
[Music]
today's workout is of course
push
chest and triceps and the front delts
that inevitably get in their easy fellas
easy in addition to the workout we're
gonna chat about more contest
bodybuilding stuff is contest
bodybuilding series here's the question
for today during your prep do you think
about how you look on stage do you think
about what placings you might get do you
think about your competitors
do you get excited as the show draws
near do you get nervous maybe a
combination of both
talk us through it
jared all my list is gonna be terrible
cool
well this isn't necessarily for advice
we're here mostly
to talk candidly and maybe something
will be learned from that but we give
instructional videos all the time let's
just talk openly i
have always coached myself i'm seemingly
very objective and stoic through prep
doesn't bother me much
so looking at the competitors doesn't
bother me thinking about me on stage
doesn't bother me but this is all
probably stuff that would be opposite to
advice to most people especially
first-time competitors or people who are
pretty new like stop worrying about
everybody else
stop worrying about your placing all you
can do is do your best and show up to
the show and if your best is the best
that day you get cool trophies if
somebody who's been competing for 10
years and they're they're on their way
to a national show shows up and they're
in shape they're probably getting first
and there's some politics involved and
all kinds of stuff involved so it's like
just do your best
do your best show up
and have fun that's it but like me i
love i love the other shit i love like
ooh this guy looks really good he seems
to like hit his front double like this
so if i have to stand next to him i can
do this instead and make him look small
or i can do this instead my shape would
look better than his like i look at all
the pictures of the guys and i'll even
like follow them and i'll comment on
their shit like dude you look fucking
awesome like she has like an inclusive
victory yes yeah dude it's awesome like
i love that kind of shit it's we can all
push each other 100 man charlie yeah the
whole social media thing
i feel like
i try to take on somewhat of a similar
person
yeah carlos thomas jr he looks like a
fucking freak go check him out on
instagram
he's a freak uh justin cheer or i think
that's how you say his last name yeah he
looks like phenomenal too um but yeah i
think it's all you know
fun to kind of chit chat about kind of
you know upcoming competition even
though they're your competition but
you know you're there to kind of just
improve on your
welfare do the best right yeah
physically competing against them it's
not mma where you have to punch a
motherfucker exactly right it's all in
the judge's hands for sure and you know
um
if you're gonna stress that out about
all that stuff you know i don't think
it's quite
helpful
[Music]
there you go
damn son big as hell
[Music]
hey guys
finally got me a director's chair
for adult films also the gym push downs
here's the deal
three sets but
it's mile reps on the first set
we do a straight set one to fail
zero rir something like that last week
for a few of us
good god charlie's triceps are fucked up
first set straight set get as many as
you can one from fail
the second two sets you need the same
total number of reps let's say we get 20
reps in the first set it's 20 in the
second and the third you won't be able
to do that because you're fatigued so
you take my rep rest breaks maybe take a
break or two three to five seconds
within each of those sets to get up to
the sum total of whatever you did your
first set
uh this is a really helpful thing i
found with isolation movements
curls push downs stuff like that
a lot of times like i was doing push
downs my triceps are hyper responsive to
volume i would do push downs and do five
six sets there's not a whole lot going
on there's just so few approaches to
failure with this just with three sets
we can get
seven or eight approaches to failure
very close and the stimulus is
mind-boggling give it a shot we're gonna
go hit it right now
hmm
[Music]
uh
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
let's go jared
[Music]
lock him out baby
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
is that good for youtube
the tongue
all right folks
just a few sets left cambered bar bench
triceps are super pretty exhausted so
this is going to be a movement that's
usually really nailing the pecs now it's
going to be a bit more even a lot of
packs a lot of triceps camber bar bench
is an interesting thing where if you do
it properly and go super deep like
you're supposed to the only goddamn
point of the thing
is you get actually two sticking points
you get one just above the start of the
press then you get one at lockout it's
such a huge trip if you ever have a
chance to buy one of these it's not that
expensive of a bar
if you get a chance to be at a gym to
use one use it for rows use it for bench
press
really pause at the bottom and stretch
for a little bit push all the way up
phenomenal remember
tension with stretch is a huge
hypertrophic stimulus this is the bar
for that going to be doing sets about 10
to 15. here we go just two sets for me a
few sets for the guys and we're all done
[Music]
i
almost never look at my competition
because a lot of times especially in
masters which i'm competing in now you
have no idea who's going to show up i
don't know any of these people i meet
them backstage and we chill and also
it's it's logically unbelievably
pointless to figure out who your
competition is because you're going to
bring your best anyway and they're going
to sort you anyway so if you get off on
it like
charlie great but if it's something that
draws you into a more nervous mindset
you can i promise you have no idea who's
showing up and you you'll probably look
better and you have a higher probability
of winning because you didn't know who's
showing up so if you don't take it well
you never have to pay attention to
anything and your competitors and stuff
like that
now i have mixed emotions about as the
show date nears
i have a very fraught history that's
less fraught recently with peaking
peaking for me is difficult my body
doesn't cooperate like with most people
saying
um i've taken the advice of other
coaches before and it has led to ruinous
results and them being like oh that's
weird um so a very very difficult body
to figure out peaking wise
uh so
in the back of my head on my worst days
is me doubting that i'll ever look like
i want to look on stage because i could
be super lean i could be super jacked
but i'll fuck up the peak like always
and then i'll look like shit and i'll
have to make some kind of instagram post
oh i got this and people will say things
that they're mean and very good faith
like oh i kind of wished you looked
better and you looked so much better a
week ago and blah blah blah and that
shit is painful as fuck to see because
you just pissed away like fucking months
of your life
showing up and doing nothing
and uh so to me it's always a little bit
of a mixed emotion but
a cool plus side for me is because i'm
so used to public speaking and being all
fucking insta-famous and shit being a
professor
walking onto the stage a lot of people
are nervous to get onto a stage i
literally have to think so far back in
my life where i was last nervous
speaking or presenting in front of
people that i'll walk on front of the
stage if they said like hey
just do new division you get your pro
card if you just like show us your dick
right now 400 people would be like is
this legal and they'd be like well yes
here we go you know your boy's not
particularly well in doubt i could give
a fuck
jerry you had this before there's like a
little beef backstage your guys are like
charlie you've seen that shit backstage
i want i want to hear your story in just
a second but also like i'm probably one
of the only guys backstage in a
bodybuilding tournament who's like a jiu
jitsu brown belt and we're all covered
in oil which really does actually
benefit me a ton so like if shit was to
go down i'd be like you motherfuckers
pick the wrong day
so and also like i'm super jovial i make
jokes different backs it's very
confusing so i'll be in a line to go up
on stage and i'm like hey you guys blah
blah and they're like some guy's giggle
and some guys you're like man it's just
fucking hardcore so i'm just having a
good time so as soon as we get to the
show it's all gravy it's just a few
weeks before i tend to get a little bit
into my head but i'm working on that you
know
doing better all the time
[Music]
you'll see that i'm not doing the same
last movement
as jared and mike
that's because this whole prep this
whole macro cycle for me
um i haven't been really doing any
free weight pressing so
i started warming up on that
and it felt a little bit unstable
and it did feel
a little weirdness in my shoulders
um
in any other situation
i'd probably keep warming up
see if it alleviates itself as it warms
up but
we're so close to our show right now so
um to throw in
these variables
and chance any type of injury
for
um
the sake of doing a movement
uh probably not smart especially since
it's such a novel movement for me
uh compared to my whole microcycle
and i've been doing a press
very similar to this one
back in my home gym
so we decided to kind of stick with this
i just did a set right now i got an
amazing pump
so i think the choice was sound
charlie tell us about this backstage
situation let's leave the show out and
let's leave the people out there
similar to what you experienced so i was
in the back having a great time you know
talking with all these super heavies and
then the heavies are in front of me and
waiting to go up and we got it you know
it's like hey guys you ready to go to
war brothers
take you down
blood iron tears whatever you were
saying yeah i'll say that afterwards
everyone's giggling right and then uh
the one guy he he's like
yep i mean like you know it really came
down to him you know i could take you
all off he was serious he was 100
serious he's like nice to be you know
i'll play defensive line back in high
school whoa
look at that that's a cool fighting crew
i was like
i looked at everyone else and just like
it was really awkward especially like
15 seconds after he wasn't doing so well
up up there in his head no he needed to
say that to feel the compton did he take
first place in the show
no you did
no you did
right
you won that one
all right folks that's the workout for
today hopefully you enjoyed be sure as
hell did big pumps all around feeling
pretty good
join us next week
for legs uh oh legs round two
charlie how do you feel
about legs are today today got a really
good pump today uh they're pretty good
yeah definitely camber bars one of my
favorite exercises so that was fun yeah
nice little treat awesome
love it see you guys
