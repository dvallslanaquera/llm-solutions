oh it's a good job
ah that was great james what great stuff
that was awful
god i'm still in 2020 mode folks it's 20
21.
it's good to be back that's what i was
trying to get out but i couldn't
fuck we're off to a rough start
something got out not what i wanted
folks welcome back weekly webinar dr
mike dr james we're apart this time but
we're still
together spiritually sexually sometimes
i don't know where this is going why
don't we answer questions yes to all
first question comes in from zenith
the tv maker yeah dude remember stop
making tvs start asking our personal
questions
oh yeah oh yeah oh 52 likes or uploads
yes he
really wanted to know why does lifting
weights burn so few calories i thought
repairing muscle damage healing muscle
soreness replenishing fuel stores like
glycogen and creatine over caloric
expenditure similar to cardio
uh that caloric expenditure okay
that and sometimes workouts can raise
your heart rate leave you out of breath
and sweating but it seems that it's not
even close to burning as much calories
as brisk walk
and it thanks for your time friendly
russian bull and manlier paul bunyan
that was very flattering so the easiest
thing
easiest way to answer this question is
the following two-part answer from me
physically displacing objects is
considerably more energetically
laborious than performing
microscopic chemical reactions which is
why
moving around costs much more energy
than like having to heal something or
something like that which is an
intricate process
it doesn't move a huge volume of energy
around it just has to happen slowly
because it's very intricate
part one part two when you're doing
cardio it's
it's depending on the nomenclature you
use or the taxonomy use
it's called a cyclic activity which is
lifting weights is acyclic
um the easiest way to answer that's part
two is if you track the amount of time
you're actually lifting weights
it's very little it may be i know that
sounds scary
it may be 20 minutes per two hour
workout
okay and then it's like yeah for those
20 minutes you burned a shitload of
calories
but you sat around for the rest of the
time so if aliens
watch like a weightlifting team it'd be
like so what do you guys think they're
doing like well they're mostly sitting
like
that's true they are mostly sitting but
they're getting more fit from sitting
right exactly they're like these are the
sitting team again you're like yes it's
the city
so because they do way more sitting than
weightlifting they're like occasionally
this weightlifting thing but that seems
uninteresting because it's not the
majority of the time so
uh in cardio you keep moving and
movement costs a huge amount of energy
uh this is illustrated in something like
transportation even this is not
applicable not just to human systems
the amount of energy it takes to move a
plane full of people
from london to new york is fucking
ridiculous
and i think last i checked it's
mathematically
more energy than 100 efficient solar
panels the size of a plane
could absorb from the sun so like
solar-powered flight
in an airliner is physically impossible
like you just need higher density fuel
so uh so that that really is the answer
uh and i wish
i wish it weren't so because it wouldn't
be great if you could lift weights four
times a week and burn thousands of
calories it's just not the case james
yeah and this is actually pretty well
documented in exercise science for most
high intensity types of exercise
including like high intensity cardio and
weights would fall into the same general
idea of just like high intensity
intermittent exercise
and what you find is that yeah you do
actually have a big energy output you're
just not doing that much total
exercise as dr mike said and one thing
to keep in mind tying into your question
and this is really well demonstrated if
you look at the high intensity interval
training
research the actual amount of energy
that you burn while you're
working out is like not that much it's
okay
but you actually do get a substantial
amount afterwards which they typically
don't measure in resistance training
stuff at all
so what we find is that if you do
something like a hit style program
you burn some calories while you work
out but you actually are still burning a
lot of calories
after you work out as you are kind of
coming down and as a result of some of
the recovery adaptive systems
just from using more energy to recover
from the increased disruption of that
intense exercise so yeah it is that is
true to some extent and some of that you
would see
later and wouldn't be measured like in a
study of like okay here's how many
calories you burn during a weight
training
session because all that's measuring is
from start to finish of the session not
kind of the downstream
things that happen later on so there are
downstream things but as dr mike said
they just don't account for that much
count that meant that that many calories
compared to just doing like steady state
exercise so
it is there and i would encourage you if
you're really interested in that topic
look at the uh
uh metabolic and calorie stuff on high
intensity interval training and you'll
see
kind of what we're talking about because
that does exist so what you're thinking
is right on track in terms of like
weight training fucks you up a lot more
why doesn't it burn more calories it
does later
just not while you're doing it and it
doesn't burn as many as you think
because healing just doesn't require as
much energy
as physically moving uh think about this
way
when you take your arm and you lift it
like this you've moved every molecule in
your arm
like a huge distance when you're healing
tissues most of the molecules there
aren't being power to go anywhere it's
just a few little small intricate ones
and it's tiny tissues so at the end of
the day like
it's just not like a great example is
like
like how long how much energy does it
take
for mechanics to fix a plane once it's
landed versus how much does it take to
fly a plane
fuck but all they have to do is turn on
the lights in the warehouse and power
their little drills like it's just
really not that much
whereas an airplane flying you guys are
hearing the engine when you're on the
plane
wow that's for eight hours it does that
like yeah it's way more
way more so all right next up is
heinrich anderson from
somewhere in the norse oh does he
address his naming no he doesn't we'll
see if he can keep making fun of his
name for no good goddamn reason
he gets pissed and addresses how you
actually pronounce it so
he says as mike has stated many times
every mesocyclone should start at med
for most muscle groups i agree however
some muscle groups never get sore
and tolerate very high volumes for
example doubts in most
cases more volume equals oh sorry for
example dels
in most cases more volume equals more
muscle growth therefore my question is
why not start the mesocycle above mev
and end at mrv
as opposed to going from mev to mrv
because uh oh
he goes edit another commentator at hay
now replied with you start an mvv to get
some easy games with a little effort
relative to others
he goes yes i've heard dr mike mentioned
this before but mike also says that
muscle grows x amount after every
workout
so doesn't more volume equal more growth
well more volume can equal more growth
to a point but you also have to
include the fatigue cost it's not just
what you grow this session
is how much fatigue does this session
contribute to the next one and how many
sessions can you string in a row
that are growing something so if you
start it close to med
and go to mav average and then go all
the way to mrv
you're getting the entire spectrum of
really good growth and you're not
eliminating the bottom part which is
arguably the one with the best stimulus
to fatigue ratio
now it's not the one with the best total
yield but you
definitely can't just scratch it off the
list without really explaining some shit
james and i always say if you start
above mev you'd have to have a real good
reason to do that
so if you are training your shoulders
with a relatively low volume you can
keep doing it for weeks and weeks
without accumulating a whole lot of
fatigue and you're growing the whole
time
why the fuck would you not do that it's
also really low injury risk
that's something else you have to
integrate is you could look back at your
entire training career
and you say okay i have three major
shoulder injuries and someone's like you
know if you trained from mev
instead of from the mid midway all the
way up you would have only have two
injuries but god damn that would cost me
a lot less one of the jury took me out
for two years
so at the end of the day you can start
at
you know sort of the midway point but
then it's difficult for you to answer
the question of
why aren't you getting the easy gains
that's a tough question to answer
and actually i wanted to revisit point
number two that dr mike was making about
injuries there and i think a lot of
people just assume that because you know
mav
is this like pretty big gap of scores
that you could be training at
potentially
they just think like well why not just
jump right into that one of the problems
you run into is that your muscles might
not be conditioned to tolerate what were
your mav volumes before
and that's the problem that you run into
right so you might be thinking like oh
man
doing 12 sets per week at mev is lame i
was doing like 24
sets you know earlier why don't i just
jump in at like 20. it's like because
you're not used to doing 20 sets yet
you got to build up to that that's an
easy way the most predictable way
of giving yourself an injury or at the
very least prematurely overreaching a
certain muscle group or even
systemically if it's a big muscle group
hands down huge changes in your training
loads are
that is that is the path to victory if
your goal is to be injured
excellent much
unfortunately many people don't think
that through all right diy
kevin got it
but i really don't like this question
because no i know
yeah okay we'll see what goes with the
path to nowhere
question am i genetically ungifted yes
i'm just
um in the brain
i've heard people say i've heard you say
that any stimulus for us beginners is
adequate to grow muscle yes some muscle
all right i'm a beginner male i train
four or six times a week
full body squat bench double photo press
rows with an adequate volume 10 or 20
subscribers a week
and anywhere from four to zero rep range
between six to 15 and decent form
i'm eating one gram per pound of body
weight uh
and mostly clean foods i've been gaining
weight too currently 190
pounds the last year i've added 10 to 20
to my lifts
but i'm still tiny and weak estimate 1rm
140 pounds bench 170 pound squat 160
deadlifts why am i not seeing the newbie
gains
that you mentioned in your videos i'm
constantly trying to optimize my
workouts
and nutrition to fix any issues that i
might be making according to your videos
it shouldn't be this difficult to grow
as a beginner i know i shouldn't compare
myself to others but it's really
demotivating seeing other people put on
size who don't train as often who have
pathetic form
and generally don't put as much effort
or thought in their workouts could it be
that i just won the lottery for crap
genetics or do you think i'm overlooking
something
so uh we actually have a really simple
answer for you in
the hypertrophy made simple series
there's like an
eight point troubleshooting guide it's
one of the last videos
go look at that and make sure you've got
all that shit squared away
another thing is go get your regular
blood work done which you should be
doing once a year anyway i think is a
normal healthy human that works good
like you could be fucking a knee they
can really not know it and your doctor
gives you an iron supplement all of a
sudden you're gone four weeks later
so outside of those two things that come
to mind for me quickly
i will say something sort of on a
perspective of
individual psychology here um you said i
know i should compare myself to others
and you could have stopped there
um look man we can all make that
comparison
like and i'll go off a little around
here like people ask me like oh you know
you're this and that brainy asshole you
fucking you're on special sports
supplements too
how come you're not as big as this pro
i'll go listen to this pro
well that pro couldn't fucking barely
tie his fucking shoes he's that dumb
i could fucking learn everything he
knows and then learn 10 times more just
to make fun of him for it
but unfortunately don't have as good of
genetics as the best people in the world
so you know i have pretty good muscle
biology genetics i'm pretty jacked
but i could compare myself to a bunch of
people like jared feather my roommate
included
and feel shitty about myself and the
real question is what is at the end of
that road
of sort of negative comparisons there's
nothing there there's nothing there
because there's nothing to do
if you compare yourself to someone uh
and you could actionably do something to
fix the problem
and the problem is worth it to you and
it's worth the trade-offs then there's
something to do
but we unfortunately crispr the genetic
altering technique is
pretty rough still doesn't work all that
great certainly that landscape has not
been
very well trotted out uh to enhance your
muscle growth genetics
so for now you really just yeah you
don't really have
a recourse so it's kind of fucking
pointless to even think like do you ever
think that maybe you're not as good
looking as other people
you know me i i tend to be as a rather
intelligent individual
you know if i listen to ray kurzweil
talk i feel stupid i could feel bad
about that all the time
you know you're almost never going to be
the smartest guy the strongest guy the
best looking guy
you know how they got another one for
you kevin how big is your dick you know
there's a pretty good chance that like
you have a bigger dick than me and
you've pulled your pants off in front of
wheeling girls before they're like damn
that's what's up and i've pulled my
pants down in front of willingly girls
like oh you know we'll try to work with
this you know what i'm saying we'll try
to accommodate you
little bitch like who knows you never
know who's got what and who's got
you may be a very kind hard working
awesome person
which is fucking awesome being around
people like oh kevin i guess
i wish everyone was like kevin where's
that guy who's in the gym jacked as a
fucking
mentally ill asshole who's a piece of
shit and everyone wants them dead
you know there's so much more to this
shit you've got the genetics you've got
all you can do is try your best if we
were to say that if we were to
you did try quote unquote everything or
all the troubleshooting stuff
do you have pretty shit genetics yeah
they're fucking not the greatest
do we know how much better you can get
over the long term no
when i started lifting i was a hundred
pounds
i i benched 55 pounds on the incline
barbell press
for 10 reps and failed i was one of the
weakest people in my entire class
now i'm for sure the strongest person
probably ever graduated my high school
and like like you know all this fucking
muscle shit and
it's just because i kept getting
stronger over a long time there was
never a time when i was like oh wow i
have great genetics
it just kept going you don't know if
you're one of those people because the
mechanisms to
get your initial conditions going are a
little bit different different enough
than the mechanisms by which you
actually improve
that you don't know so what i would say
is you say you're training uh you know
for like what what do you say
beginner i say go a couple more years
and see how it comes along
you may find yourself in a position in a
couple years where you're like way
stronger
have a fucking ball or looking body and
you're like man i think fucking god
didn't quit or some stupid shit like
that or you have a couple years you may
find that like
a friend invites you running long
distance and you're like
all of a sudden you like are basically
an elite cross country level on your
third try and you're like oh shit i was
designed for endurance you can quit all
this lifting bullshit
you go have awesome fun and be
recognized for being a ball endurance
athlete
matter of fact james and i went to
school there were some other phd
students that were also
um around they were in a different
program but they were ethiopian
and i watched an ethiopian dude who was
145 pounds staple himself
with 135 in the bench over and over he
could not bench 135 pounds
right but he told me that he never gets
tired when he runs
i'm like what he's like one of the top
ranked guys in the world in the 5 000 10
000.
maybe you're that guy so yeah you're as
it seems your gen x might not be great
go make sure you do really checking off
all the lists
give it a couple more years couple more
months at least couple more years and
see if you're still progressing
progress is the name of the game and if
you don't like how you're progressing or
you stall out way early
you can always think about doing some
other shit and just lift for health two
to three times a week
and uh not worry so much about dumb shit
that you're maybe not cut out for you
know you don't
see me going to death poetry jams and
writing you know uh
you know all kinds of shit um that's
outside of my scope because i'm just not
fucking good at it so
no big deal yeah that was really good so
dr mike and i tend to not like this
question because the
the end game as we already said is
ultimately like what are you going to do
even if you have shitty genetics you're
going to keep training and just doing
your best because that's all you can do
right
you can't really change what the
genetics that you have so a couple
things just to keep in mind also
i mean adding 10 to 20 percent on your
lifts
is good i don't know what world you live
in where that's not good
uh yeah that's solid progress right
right i mean
that that will never happen to me ever
again within a year for sure
ever unless you're not used to this
unless i just pick i pick an exercise
that i have never
ever done before right and i just like
happened to get really good at it but
that's not like
me getting beefier that's just me
getting better at skill the skill of
doing the exercise
or pick up a needle you've never done
before you who
folks don't want to go down that road
but so just keep that in mind right like
10 to 20
is like within the realm of beginner
gains that's pretty good like that's
fine within a year yeah that's solid
um and then again like we already beat
this one to death but
the only reason why you might ask this
question of like
do i have bad genetics for this activity
is simply just the opportunity cost of
doing the activity right
could you potentially be putting your
efforts into something else
that you're good at that brings you joy
and satisfaction and maybe toning down
how much lifting you're doing
as mike said you could just back off and
do it for health like maintaining your
strength your muscle mass your bone and
joint health
and then doing something else maybe
you're good at soccer endurance
rugby kickboxing pick something else go
for it right that's the reason why you
ask this question not so you can feel
shitty about your efforts and what other
people everyone else is doing right so
keep that in mind do your best if you
find that it's not the opportunity cost
is not worth it based on the results
that you're getting
then find something else that's fun to
do yeah
yeah 100 charles austin's up next
got it do you ever find that some of
your lyft numbers are staying the same
or getting slightly worse for but your
pump
progress in the mirror and mind muscle
connection are all skyrocketing
i'm guessing my technique is just
improving over time so i'm performing
weight
with much better technique um pump
progress in the mirror
and my muscle connection all
skyrocketing i've never gotten
um slightly worse i have gotten slightly
worse by
notably willfully altering my technique
for better sfr that takes numbers off
i think yeah so the james the troubling
thing about his way of saying it is
he says i'm guessing my technique is
just improving you probably remember
that
uh you know my question to you charles
is do you remember
eccentric do you remember trying to go
down a little deeper do you remember
trying to take a closer or wider stance
you know that kind of stuff
should be like some things at least
someone consciously you know what i mean
yeah though like to this point like so
if your numbers are if you're lifting
numbers like the weight and or reps that
you're getting
are kind of staying roughly the same or
maybe even going down but you do find
like all those other indices are going
up like you're getting better pumps
um better mind muscle connections you're
probably
maybe not but probably individualizing
your technique in a more efficacious way
increasing your sfr
that's a good thing right and i can
definitely say that that has happened to
me especially like
i used to be like a butt squatter to the
max and it's taken a long time for me to
build up my quads to the point where i
can be more of a quad squatter
and as a result you know my squad i
could squat a lot if i sit
did like a fucking west side you know
squat and then my numbers all have been
going down over time but my quads have
been getting
bigger as a result right that's
trade-off that you make um so if if
we're interpreting it
in that way then yeah that is something
that can happen but i think to dr mike's
point
you don't want to just assume that that
is happening either you want to document
like what changes did i make did i try
and control the eccentric did i take a
slightly different stance was i
moving my knees a little bit further out
this time like you don't want to just
assume that you're
improving your sfr though i would say
science
science point to yes yeah james can you
give me one second to ask jared a few
questions about our
tran plans for training and i'll just be
right back okay do you want me to move
on or just want to pause for a second uh
you just pause for a second we'll get
scott to clip this out or something or
if not it'll just be awkward for a
second give me a give me one second
that's fine we're just gonna be awkward
for a sec
so while dr mike's dealing with some
other stuff
hopefully you guys are enjoying the
hypertrophy book i know we've gotten a
lot of good feedback on it and i'm glad
a lot of
people seem to be enjoying it would love
to hear any of your guys's comments so
like a fun fact for whatever reason
we don't see a lot of if you guys are
leaving reviews we don't see them for
like a couple weeks
i don't know why that's the case but
that's the case for the website so i am
really curious to see what people
thought about the hypertrophy book so
i'd be loved to see if you guys want to
leave some comments just saying like hey
these are things that i liked or hey
these are things that were confusing or
maybe incomplete thoughts
that we need to get wrapped up would
love to hear it and then if you guys
aren't aware
dr davis actually just released a book
on
habit building which i think you should
all check out um she's obviously
my wife dr wife uh it's some of it it
relates to exercise but it's not a book
directly about you know like exercise
and nutrition it's more about like if
you have
behaviors and habits that you're trying
to develop what are like the
evidence-based ways
of doing so so if that's something that
tickles your fancy especially
now that we're in the new year and i'm
sure you've all probably set some new
year's resolutions that would be a good
one to check out
as well uh i forgot what the name of it
is i want to say it's like
evidence-based habit building
getting shit done either way it's on the
rp website so check that out
i was also just looking through our
fucking youtube channel
did you guys notice that there's like 30
videos in between the last two webinars
that we did that's
insane looks like dr mike's back i was
just saying uh
i was scrolling through looking for the
last webinar because we skipped a week
and there was like 30 videos in between
the last webinar
that we did what the fuck off to a crazy
start
and i made sure i made some shameless
plugs in the meantime
oh sweet yeah perfect all right now it's
time for riley to make a shameless plug
all right riley asks how to determine
the stimulus to fatigue ratio of
movement when the pump intention feels
great for
those little to no soreness the
following day this happens with certain
pressing movements for me and of course
with small muscle groups like delts and
biceps and even triceps sometimes
and with progression being so small
anyways on those muscle groups it's hard
to tell if movements are actually
progressing or if i need to change them
thank you well progression should be
really easy to tell because you can
progress by at least a rep or at least
two and a half pounds or something
every week or other week so the
progression thing should actually be
guys remember you don't need to add 20
pounds per week to your lift to see if
it's progressing or not
like one of my pet peeves and riley not
that you're doing this james you and i
say that a lot one of my pet peeves not
that you're doing this person's actually
doing this
is when people are like aren't compounds
better because you can progress on them
more like what the fuck who the fuck
don't do that like
i mean physically you can add more
weight sure but like relative progress
to the lift
like can be done on any lift so you you
can detect progression on small lifts
it's not a big deal
and determining the sfr there's if you
look at our
newly published which i'm sure james
already have the ability to plug
hypertrophy book
there's literally like a formula for
calculating sfr and there's free youtube
videos
on rpe youtube of how to calculate sffr
and you just rank your pump rank your
attention and
you do rank your soreness but if the
soreness is ranked at very low
that's how you rank it and if you have
another exercise that gives you decent
pump
tension and high soreness you rank it as
well and then you see how it all ends up
in the wash and the numbers compare and
then you maybe have two equivalent
exercise
one gets you a shitload of soreness but
without a ton of tension perception
one gets you not much soreness but with
a ton of tension perception
and then you sort of stay with the
roughly equivalent sfr and i'll use one
one mesocyclone on the other
we're really looking for sfrs is the big
the big differences like if you have an
exercise that really does
shitty pumps shitty tension no soreness
it's a fucking dog shit exercise
probably
but uh or you know you're doing it wrong
or yeah if you have one that has great
pump great tension and great soreness
then you got a fucking winner right so
uh you can't compare it just one third
of the index it's kind of like saying
you know how do i value a card for
resale if it is really shitty
like um rims uh but the rest of it's
good like well you just integrate the
value of the shitty rims of the cards
you
will be 25 000 but now it's 20. you know
if you have another card with great rims
but shit everything else maybe it's also
20 000 but the rims are you know 10 000
or something and then the rest of the
car is shit so it
it's just all part of a bigger equation
with three other valuable
variables james yeah that was really
good so i think
dr mike hit a really good point there
and you're looking for the big
differences so like when when mike was
talking the thing that first came to my
mind was like okay if i'm looking at the
sfr of like a hamstring or posterior
chain exercise what we're looking for is
like the difference between like a
reverse hyper and an
sldl right that's something where you
can go oh
wow that was a big difference the sldl
and i'm gonna go on a limb here and say
i think for most people
is gonna be the better choice than like
something like a reverse hyper right
not like okay what was my lateral raise
versus my thumbs down lateral raise
versus my 45 degree lateral
like that's that's fine you can do that
kind of nitpick but it's probably going
to be
roughly equivalent more often than not
so focus on like those big changes where
you can really notice
big differences in tension pump and even
soreness to some extent
that's what you want to keep an eye out
for not the like whoa i felt it a little
bit more here
but i didn't really get sort but this
one i got a little bit sorted with
that's like yeah don't worry another
thing about sfr is like the main ways we
use it is twofold
one don't do shitty sfr exercises or
alter your technique to make sure
they're not shitty
so just good sfr is good enough because
you have very
variation it just gets you in the
rotation like you don't have to find the
best exercise because it's not the best
forever another one takes over
and two you use sfr to try to improve
the per exercise sfr
given that you were getting certain
pumps tension and soreness try to get
better pump attention so
from the same amount of volume while
turning your technique your cadence
your grips so on and so forth and then
the sfr is super useful but if you want
like an exact
like if someone's a car right what's
better so far for you is it hybrid squat
or
leg press you're like oh i don't know
who gives a shit are they both good yes
are you trying to make both of them
better yes you're fucking gold you know
solid yeah all right winning the
uh the today's award for the most jewish
name
podcast yaakov
okay can i tangent really quick so i was
i've been doing a lot of the amazon
stuff for rp and
uh one of the funny things they they
have this like reoccurring restriction
if you're trying to do like a paperback
print they
it just like every time you you click on
anything regarding the paperback it's
like
no yiddish you cannot be anything in
yiddish
i don't know what the hell kind of
fucking racism is that shit i know every
time you
everything i keep clicking and i keep
getting this notification that's like
make sure it's not in yiddish and i'm
like god okay i got it boss this one guy
trying to publish in yiddish and they're
like i hate this guy
yeah all right jacob rosne
says what is the best way to get back to
training after an injury pike certified
surgical intervention and prolonged
rehab for example rotator cuff repair
also during the rehab process is there
any truth to the cross education whereby
continuing
unilateral training on the unaffected
side maintain strength on the
uninjured side even though there will be
uneven hypertrophic changes james this
is all you buddy
yeah so first and foremost getting back
to training after an injury
especially if you needed surgery first
thing
don't be a dumbass and think that you
know better than your physical therapist
do the physical therapy for the love of
god
just do it and this is coming from a guy
who blew his acl
and had the same ego problem that i just
said not to do and guess what it cost me
a lot of time and i had two
vastly different shaped legs for a very
long time which is not a great way to
pick up chicks
awful second of all i believe actually i
think dr mike did a really good
video might correct me if i'm wrong uh
you actually did a video on
rehabbing from injury where you walked
through um like doing the higher
rp strength podcast and it is available
on youtube
okay so check that one out because i
think mike beats it to death
um and we've talked about this a couple
different times so you know first step
do the pt once your physical therapist
gives you the go-ahead to start doing
resistance training stuff they will tell
you exactly what you're supposed to do
once they cut you loose right then you
can start following dr mike's
recommendations which you can find in
that podcast
but it generally involves going from
like higher repetition slow controlled
movements usually single joint kind of
stuff
and then working your way across the
intensity spectrum of
load and exercises that are more
challenging
over time until you're close to getting
back to normal over the course of
several months maybe upwards of a year
there is a
cross-education effects um and there's
actually some really interesting stuff
on this i was looking into this when i
was working on the book that i'm working
on
uh where the cross-education
not can only can not only help keep some
of the strength in whatever
muscles that you're having a hard time
yeah from a neurological standpoint so
it keeps like the
the actual neurological characteristics
of strength at least to some degree
but to a lesser degree it actually can
also
maintain some of your muscle mass when
combined with um
uh non-physical practice so when you're
actually doing there's a
uh what's fuck what's it called mike
what's it called when you you're doing
mental practice
uh i usually ask you that question
visualization
visualization training yeah when you're
doing visualization training along with
cross
uh you like training the other side
somewhat normally
um it does seem to have an effect of not
only preserving strength but actually
preserving a small
albeit a small amount of you're
definitely going to atrophy to some
degree but you'll have to feed less
if you actually do visualization
training and do cross-education
there's no i don't want to call it
cross-education training all that is is
just training the other side of your
body that still works normally
um but yes that is a thing however that
is a very small thing in comparison to
doing
physical therapy so do that first
um yaakov
will tell you the name of the video you
should go search it is podcast episode
15
developing your comeback plan after
injurious doctor israel and it's on the
clinical
athlete youtube page oh perfect yeah
that's right up here
all right jacob kowal
going from jewish to polish yeah
same name actually literally the same
name it's like jose and joe oh wow that
is oh
that didn't even notice that can you
briefly talk about program
imperialization for street lifting yo
motherfucker we in the streets
am i the old fuddy daddy here who
doesn't know what that is
yep luckily he explained it is that all
it is it's just one
day is that all it is it's like it pull
ups chin up
um uh i don't know what when our wonder
i'm squat
i don't know what the hell that is do
they do this like in a like a power
lifting type competition
i know it says street but i'm thinking
like you got a fucking squat squat rack
set up somewhere what the swat
is is a misnomer
but maybe not so i was thinking of like
street like you know when people do like
the crazy street performances where
they're like hanging
you know perpendicular on trees and
light posts and stuff that's what i
first thought but now i'm like
that's what i thought it was i gotta
look up what street lifting is but we'll
take
him at his word one arm pull up chin up
yo what are you gonna do we got these
squat racks up in the streets
yeah i'm trying to work on my 1rm dog i
can't tell if he
is he he says one around but i can't
tell if he means like
a rep max effort or if he really means
one repetition max because one rep max
makes it sounds like power lifting
more or less just with different
activities yeah so it's pull up chain up
dip
that's actually kind of cool squat and
uh want to run bar
muscle up jesus that's a fucking
dangerous thing to do
but goodbye uh rotator cuffs i'm just
kidding i
probably woke up to that um if it's too
bright on a question that maybe james
could do an episode for it this is a
niche sport no one in the sports science
talks about james
you can always do that if you want but
if you fucking if i can find
if i can find this i'll do an episode on
it yeah
so e real easy beginning part of a
question it's going to be
program periodization that's almost
identical to that for
something like powerlifting it's one
around here powerlifting imperialization
can just be called one around
periodization it would be almost the
same
the thing is like aside from the muscle
up most of these are not the most
dynamic movements
ever and then frankly like the muscle up
in the chin up is going to have a lot of
carry over nah i'm not saying they're
the same but
and dip celeb
i mean so really like most of these are
pretty static in terms of like they're
done with if
if we're interpreting it as written uh
heavy load done really slow
and even the muscle up is gonna be a
little bit more dynamic but you can't be
that dynamic at one rep max
so uh the periodization is really easy
because you don't have to do any power
or explosive tribe training it's
literally just maximal strength training
power lifting training
just substitute the these lifts instead
of the power list that's really it
yeah that's really good all right vasil
nice i wouldn't have any with the rp
logo it used to be a picture of my fat
face back when i was younger and now
it's the rp logo thanks for confusing
everyone i see
you've earned the title of fanboy of the
year
no blowjobs come without supplements or
something yeah
good god seal actually has a very good
question he says
asks rather does play cost him
controversy but here we go after reading
dr helm's muscle and strength pyramid
and doctor israel tells anne hoffman's
hypertrophy book and jared and ml good
um i hate being a fucking muscle
celebrity anyway
um love it you love it yeah james i love
the shit out of it
um there seems to be a myriad of
differences between the two approaches
uh now dr helms suggests for hypertrophy
that only weight increases be made
weekly for compound movements
while dropping a rep percent
from the first to the final week in
order to meet the target
rir and only rep increases for isolation
movements
all volume is held constant while on the
other hand we know rp's approach
with volume and meso cycle progression
is in this case
one more right than the other or does dr
helms approach more cater to strength
progression because volume load
on compounds has decreased each week
substantially so it's definitely more
catered to strength progression i'll
give you that
is one more right than the other well we
certainly think we're more right
um for about five percent of that for
the other 95
is just two ways of hitting a
progression that results in basically
the same thing as
training pretty hard a little bit harder
um on average over time and making sure
that you're always challenging yourself
in a progressive manner
there's a lot of ways to skin a cat and
every single one of those uh pretty much
make the cat miserable and useless
afterwards
wow skinless cat
but uh most of this is just down to like
eric will just give an example and a lot
of the stuff rp does is really just an
example there's many many ways to
approach it that just
couldn't concern themselves in the
general principle
on applications we do differ from the
3dmj folks
significant in the fact that we do um
open ourselves to the possibility of
altering
set numbers for a mesocycle and if
you're curious about an in-depth
discussion of that
just go find myself brian miner eric
helms jared feather discussing on steve
hall survive stronger podcast
um set progression uh we're not set
progression
and that's four hours or some shit of uh
really in-depth nuance the end of the
day none of us really know for sure
if set progression is better than static
sets we think it probably is better
they think it might not be justified
over complicating things not sure who's
right
tons of mutual respect both ways why
don't you read the book read their books
think about it in your head which one
seems to make the most sense for you
try them both don't do extreme versions
of either one
and then you see what you think yeah i
think dr mike's right on that one so i
don't mind saying that i think ours is
is more correct
the thing is like you can get great
results from increasing things like
intensity
but at the same time you can also start
getting false positives where you might
be thinking
uh you're looking at your numbers
mesodermeso week to week and you're like
man i'm getting a lot of progression
and that's cool right but what are you
actually progressing
in right are you just getting stronger
which is cool
but are you getting more jacked like
sometimes some of the best blocks that
you'll ever have in hypertrophy training
you might not see your numbers go up a
ton until you do a re-sensitization
cycle and all of a sudden it's like chew
why well it's because your fatigue
fitness balance
is has been diminished as a result of
all the volume that you've been doing so
you're
growing new fitness in this case
strength as a result of you gaining
muscle mass over time it's currently
masked by all the fatigue that you have
from doing all the hard training and all
of a sudden
but there's actually a in the
hypertrophy book
there's a great example graph and i
don't remember which chapter it's in
but there's a graph where we should kind
of show and i uh
i don't want to say an idealized but we
kind of said like here's an example of
what
progressing in performance kind of looks
like across several mesocycles and
here's one
of progressing in volume and what you
find is that the end performance like if
performance is something that you're
really interested in looking at
both of them kind of end on the same
general note except in one
case you're way more jacked than the
other one
in theory um so check that out if you
haven't checked that out
i personally don't think there's a a ton
of debate here in terms of uh because
you can look at things like even just
from a very simple like work capacity
standpoint like your work capacity
starts low and goes up like
there's a huge incentive to start low
and build up as per your work capacity
can tolerate right then and there that's
a really easy
just kind of segue into why you might
even have a volume progression at all
why because you can't do ten sets right
now you can only do two but
later after a couple months now you can
do 10 sets why not
totally all right jr is up next
got it i can't see jr without thinking
about jr from wwe
like the guy who stroked out with a
cowboy hat like oh my god
you sick some bitch oh hellfire
brimstone stone cold
phone call uh all i can think of is like
a little wayne song
where he's like i'm the bird man and or
you're the bird man and i'm the j
aura which i think means junior uh
yeah why are you listening to a little
wayne what's this self-answering
question because shit is dope straight
mad fire son i just didn't think that
was your cup of tea
yeah back in the day it's like a high
school memory all right
question hypothetically and say you're
connected to shame rv is 18 to 20 sets
of 2 r
but 10 sets at 0 rer
i feel like we've answered this before
right now i think we talked about it
i think we had a similar question yeah
10 sets of zero rer
i've no oh i did you and i just talked
about it because i saw it previewed ten
sets at zero rer i've noticed that a
failure we given at moderate volumes
could jack me up
well after a deload week what are your
thoughts on the hybrid routine below so
i can still benefit from rp style
training
five week bezo week one twelve seven
four fourteen
we didn't answer it on video we just
answered it ranting to each other
um and unless we're redoing this whole
webinar
which is no way that's possible i hope
he might have reposted the question
maybe um 14 sets
16 sets 18 sets at four three two one
rar and then ten sets of zero er
this way you get the benefits of
increasing volume and testing true
failure once on his own
without crippling yourself for weeks to
come by the way the connective tissue
issues were never a problem until i got
into my late 30s and 40s
the other options never go to zero or
irr but i'm the absolute worst with
guesstimating or i arm
i need true failure at least once a meso
open disgustion so my best suggestion is
don't go to truth failure because it
just seems that the stimulus the fatigue
ratio is fucking dog shit for you
in that case just make sure you're
getting stronger over time you don't
have to worry about the going through
failure because you're challenging
yourself with more and more loads
like if you used to squat 300 and i
squat 350 for the same reps it doesn't
matter if you're going to true failure
or not because you know
you know the shit is grinding and it's
pretty tough and you're making gains
fuck it
if you really have like basically a 50
reduction
in sfr it's difficult for james and i to
suggest that
is worth it you just what is it i'll put
it this way
uh just a comical way of answering your
question what is it you think you're
getting out of zero rir
that's worth such a massive reduction of
stimulus to fatigue ratio
not to mention the the set reduction
that he has to take in order to do that
right so we're going from 12
14 16 18 and then 10 sets at zero rar
that's a really big drop in sets it is
wildly unlikely that the hypertrophic
outcome is going to be equivalent in 18
cents at 1r
is not the equivalent hypertrophy 10
cents a zero r under almost any
circumstance
it's wildly wildly overwhelmingly likely
that uh it's gonna be like one and a
half times the growth at least
and so you don't have to grind it just
you should just never go to failure is
my absolute best answer
if you do choose to go to failure your
method is absolutely really good
because you're attending to the fact
that there's a certain amount of fatigue
you just don't want to accumulate
because if you did do 20 sets at zero r
you'd be crippled four weeks and that
would be
really the stupidest thing so i think
yours is the second best answer
i would give um you may disagree uh you
may be correct
but i would say that the best answer is
just to do
uh week five 20 sets again at one rer
try to keep out
one more rep here and there or maybe a
two and a half more
pounds on the bar or something and then
just he load repeat
i don't think it's worth it to go to
zero r as long as you're progressing
but also consider maybe changing your
exercises it sounds like
your sfr choices it from whatever you're
doing is just shitty in terms of you
like you shouldn't have this
massive connective tissue limitation for
really for any i mean
sure people are going to have like i
know for me like elbows are kind of a
touchy one
depending on what i'm doing everybody's
got their own thing but i mean if it's
just like a consistent problem for you i
would say re-evaluate the sfr of the
movements that you're choosing and then
the techniques that you're doing within
those movements because you might just
be
making bad choices you might just be
like doing something that fucks you up
needlessly
for example maybe you are doing kind of
like elbows tucked in on your bench kind
of like a strengthy kind of bench and
that just fucks your elbows up really
bad
whereas if you just mixed in like some
wide grip pressing or maybe some pec
flies or cable flies
you're going to get a great stimulus and
your elbows don't get fucked up as much
like those are things definitely worth
entertaining
yeah super
last question of the day thomas lee
thomas lee tommy lee yeah if thomas lee
in a middle name he would for sure be
like a guy who tried to assassinate the
president
all right thomas please there you go
jesus he's a great actor
a generational actor oh yeah thomas he
asks what does it mean if i'm able to
match performance but relative effort
increases in doing so
no increase in volume from previous
micro for example 10 reps of 2
200 pounds last week it's theorem but
this week 10 reps
at 200 pounds is one rir if i'm
understanding correctly
this isn't a drop of performance it's
not a formal drop in performance correct
but does the fact that the same work was
harder or mean that i'm slightly above
him or if
it doesn't it's not conclusive enough
but it probably means
either having an off day or holding a
lot of fatigue this actually performance
increase since i did the same work
carrying more fatigue it might be and
this is what's fucked up the fitness
fatigue paradigm is confusing
and it's a little bit of like like a
quantum black box schroedinger's cat
sort of situation that
the analysis itself is disruptive to the
system
so your best bet is to do a third week
and see if you can go up again
up actually not again for the first time
and see if you can continue aprs and
here's why
james and i overwhelmingly recommend the
match
or beat rep progression and set
progression system which is again you
can
just youtube that what i just said and
it'll come up with an rp
video explaining that we do proactive
increases
in either one or two reps at a time or
two and a half to ten pounds on the bar
you try to match your reps
or the load but the other reps or load
whichever ones you're not
uh matching you try to increase you try
mini pr every single micro cycle
when you cannot do that anymore it is a
performance
um plateau and you can be certain that
your fatigue is too high and then
like if the plateau repeats itself or it
goes down and you underperform then you
can be like okay i'm over my mrv
for sure if you don't push the pace if
you try to repeat the same efforts
it's tough to tell what's going on is it
the fatigue rising is it really the
underlying system is it really doing
better well almost certainly the fatigue
is rising it's highly unlikely you're
losing fitness right
so relatively speaking that performance
is not as impressive in the second week
as it was in the first
but you could crinkle your mind up into
a fucking trash can
thinking what is what how is how how do
we
you know what do i take from this
because there is inherent uncertainty
into that system
you can remove all the uncertainty in
the world by starting it like roughly
3rir
and just adding weight and no reps until
you cannot continue to progress and then
deal and repeat
because everything in that window has a
little bit of flux to mystery and we
can't quite tell what's going on
until one of two things one just the
beginning we know it's roughly three or
four ir we know we're in a good place we
know it's low fatigue
and at the end we know when we can't
keep going anymore um
that's that's really that's really kind
of it you know it's it's like
if you have like a an experimental plane
that tests
which the highest altitude it could go
to you can say well the first flight
you know it started to ring all these
you know error bells at ninety thousand
feet and the second flight
it started ringing up at 80 but the
controller felt more solid than it was
at 80 last time so
here's the thing if you have a great
ejection capsule a huge assumption
just keep going until you fucking can't
go and then you'll know what the fucking
top altitude is
speculation especially when you get
close to the top
can be going either way you don't get a
lot out of james
yeah really good answer and so i'm going
to give another answer but i totally
agree with the
like the match or beat system that's my
go-to as dr mike said so that's always
what i would recommend just to just to
give a little other
uh suggestion so one thing that you can
also do i mean like considering that
you can have a really good training
session even if like
let's say you are kind of not really
sure you're in the same situation maybe
you say okay
i'm gonna go up to 205 and just kind of
see what happens and maybe you get like
nine eight seven instead of like
ten nine eight does that mean that you
had a really bad session
no you probably had objectively still a
pretty good hypertrophy training session
are you necessarily overreached
no you just increase the weight and
maybe you're carrying a little systemic
fatigue
you can still actually have a really
really great session even if you don't
always
match or beat especially if you increase
the load anyway right
so as long as like for example if we're
using the 5 to 10 rep range like
anything within five to ten reps is
probably pretty good in terms of the
session now
if you put you know get up to 210 and
you do one set
at nine okay so that was less than ten
maybe not great but it's still kind of
in the ballpark the next one is like
five the next one is four
right now that's more of a sign that you
might have actually been overreaching on
whatever you were doing before maybe
your fatigue state's not great
but as you add weight and you don't
always match your beat but you're still
in the goal rep range and objectively
things feel pretty good still good pumps
still good mind muscle and you're not
getting crippling soreness the next time
you're probably okay yep this is just
one of those things like you don't
necessarily want to
it's good to be thoughtful but you don't
necessarily want to get into that
schrodinger's box situation where you're
like i can't tell
if i'm do if i'm good or not like if
you're not good
you'll know yeah in in
one training cycle we're not good okay
fine just don't repeat the same problem
over and over if you have a training
system which consistently leads to not
good things
you can just overreach over each overage
stop doing it
there's no nuance there for you because
that's obvious you whatever it is you're
doing is not enough
stimulus or too much fatigue or
something like that not enough nutrition
so find something that works
fundamentally well crank it
and over time you should be hitting mini
pr's here and there
um that's why james and i are always
baffled not baffled baffled in laurel
says if we don't really know how to
answer
of questions like hey like i've been
doing everything right but i'm not
making progress what do i do
it's almost like um like a quite a
question of hey jared
what is that philosophical thing where
shit answers itself um
fuck's that call say what i guess
circular reasoning
tautology tautology it answers itself
it's like
well if you're doing everything right
and you're still not making progress
you're done like so the other things is
maybe that's all you have genetically or
you're not actually doing everything
right
um so the answer to that question can be
answered itself it was like okay
what i'm doing isn't working let me
reevaluate
to see if i can change some things
because i think a lot of people have an
attachment
to certain ways of lifting and like this
has to be the answer like um
a bunch of questions were like i'm doing
between 10 and 20 sets for my dells and
they won't grow
what am i doing wrong like have you
tried five to ten sets but well that's
not enough like how do you know
uh have you tried 20 to 30 cents like
well that's too much how do you know
and they could have good answers to how
do they know but they usually don't and
then we get an email later or like a
youtube comment later like hey guys i
took your advice
six months later i have five to ten sets
per for my deadlifts and they're growing
like crazy i was just overdoing it and
it's like ta-da
so just do your best um and don't get
caught up in the weeds too much
uh performance uh will end up in the
long term telling you what you need to
be doing
totally agreed was that it for today
that's it all right folks it was fun
getting back with you guys hope
everyone's having a good start to the
new year there's
already been some crazy shit going down
so i hope everybody's staying
safe and healthy and hopefully people
are getting vaccines if they want to get
vaccines and
everybody's rolling out the new year
happy and healthy that's my wish
dr mike any any closing thoughts any fun
announcements
uh no fun announcements because it's
2021 there will be no fun
the new world order of i don't even know
what joke to make
sjws and pedophiles and hard right
conservative trump nut jobs have all
allied into this like
death star of hate
the rest of us just want to go to work
and play with our loved ones and
families
yes all right folks well great questions
this week thanks for interacting with us

youtube channel i mean even within the
last two weeks there was like 30 fucking
videos
