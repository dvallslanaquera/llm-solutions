folks welcome back it's the weekly
webinar i'm dr
james he's dr mike how's it going mike
i'm well how are you i'm doing good it's
kind of weird out here so you know it's
winter time
and we're far enough north where the sun
never really like goes up into the sky
just like hangs low so every room in the
house i'm like blinded i was trying to
get like set up
for the weather you can see the sun's
like blaring in on me so apologies
in advance if it's a little goofy on the
light side my house the sun just like is
is just ever present in the winter time
so i'm just trying to figure out a good
spot
fuck yeah all right
shall we yeah let's get to it a
or a minus rather
let's see come on control f a
minus like this
yeah except capital a there we go
boom a minus asks what's the best way to
log
slash write down your training to
improve on next week
do prescribe rir and rep range and write
your reps down
if so how do you plan your progression
for next week
so you can go to a video on the rp
strength youtube
called the wrap the the match or beat
wrapped
weight system right uh just google that
google progression
uh or like uh you know progression
formula progress formula and there's a
whole video about
how we recommend doing it or just one of
the options
basically you start out your first micro
cycle with a target rep range
and an rir and you just hit whatever
reps you're going to hit
and then the next week you try to
either use a slightly heavier weight and
get the same reps
or one or two more reps percent to
target
either the same ir or one rir lower so
if you did three rar in week one
you can try try to target three rar
again or even target two if you like
so for people that like long
progressions they can target the same
rar twice and then get like an eight
week or more
meso out of it for people that like
shorter progressions they can target
uh four uh sorry sorry they can target
the next one so it's r3 then two then
one then zero
um so that's probably the best way to do
it and then
when you have the rar target
you probably want to beat something by a
little bit of weight and or repetition
and if you notice that on that set once
you did it you're like okay that was
like rr6
then add a rep or two on the next set
versus the last time you did it or add a
little bit of load
and then try to over the multiple sets
get as close to the rr target that you
actually want
if you can't perform the reps without
going too low of an rar
still perform them and then the rir will
be way too low you'll be very fatigued
but you will at least illustrate to
yourself that your performance is
objectively
not improving or very fast you can
always recover and recycle after that
so we we say is we don't like to get
into the
weeds of you know i did 225 for 10
last week 3r this week i did 3 rir also
but it wasn't feeling as good so i just
did 225 for 9 reps that kind of stuff
psychologically can get away from you
and it can
make you give you an easy path to avoid
really really big meaningful prs
so what we would usually say is if you
did 225 for 10 last time
230 for 10 this time or 225 for 11
and if you really have to dip into the
rr to beat that
that's okay keep going next week might
be better but if next week's not better
and you fail to perform then you can do
a mini half week deload and then
reduce some fatigue and then next time
try to guess your rir better that's
probably how i'm doing james yeah really
good and um just on the other side of
the question you know a lot of people
ask us about like what programs or
logging tools should you be using for
this stuff like guys i've been using
like a pen and paper
and or like my phone when we're
traveling and it's one of those things
like if you're spending more time
fussing about how to set up your
training program and like an elaborate
spreadsheet or program like you're
spending way too much time on that and
not enough time probably training hard
the thing is like if you know how long
your mesocycles generally will go now
granted there might be some exceptions
depending on what you're doing
but if you know that for the most part
you're running four and ones you know
that you're probably going to be doing
something like a 3
2 2 1 in terms of rir you know you're
going to have some target rep ranges
per muscle or per exercise and then you
just kind of run it from there you can
either choose to increase the number of
reps that you get
within the same kind of or close rr
constrictions or
if you find that you are exceeding or on
the very top end of your goal rep range
consistently you can always add load and
that's an easy way of auto regulating it
i think you can be more nitpicky about
these things but what i think uh
i think people often come with that
question with the excuse of like how do
i make this as needlessly complicated as
possible so i can spend less time
actually focusing on what i'm supposed
to be focusing on which is just getting
in there and lifting hearts so don't
make it
you know it's one of these paralysis by
analysis situations it's
once you have the general patterns and
granted these programs can be helpful
for you
in determining some of these general
patterns but we're assuming that most of
you guys are at least kind of
intermediates and have a pretty good
idea of what's what you're doing
more often than not and if that's the
case just log how much weight you got
what the reps you got
and go from there you don't really need
to do a whole lot more than that
excellent answer up next is omkar
ranne oh nice and easy right there
would it be a good idea to do incline
presses after a shoulder press during a
push day
i've heard that the front else would
already be taxed and a flat press would
be a better idea than
incline it it kind of depends on what
you want out of that but if you do a
shoulder press first you're
automatically doesn't matter what you do
after prioritizing front belts anyway
and then if you do an incline press they
again get hit really really hard and
there could be a situation where your
pecs can
work pretty hard to make up the
difference but since systemic fatigue is
a little higher by then they probably
won't see the same
really good activity so uh you know you
will have
predominantly another front delt
exercise um
if front delts are your priority then
and your
upper pecs are something you want to
keep on the back burner and your lower
packs are also something you want to
keep on the back burner but your upper
backs are a little bit more important
doing shoulder press first and incline
second is totally great
if front delts are not your priority and
pecs are your priority
yeah i wouldn't do shoulder press first
that would be kind of weird
and if you wanted to prioritize mid and
lower pec sort of as well as
your front delts you can do shoulder
press heavy first
but then absolutely i would do something
like a flat press or some
flat decline flies decline dips where
the front delts really aren't very
active at all and it's mostly packs
yeah and one other situation you can run
into if you're deciding to do the
shoulder press and then the incline
press is that your delts
can become the limiting factor on the
performance of your chest movement which
is really just a shitty situation to
find yourself in
now that might be different depending on
your technique and your anthropometry
some people might not run into that
issue
i know for myself i for sure would run
into that issue where if i did heavy
shoulder presses and then tried to
incline bench my shoulders would just
crap out and my chest would be like this
was stupid why did we do this
why did you just do that incline bench
first whereas like the reverse i could
probably pull off just fine
so it's going to be a little bit
different from person to person but you
don't want the you know you want the
limiting factor on any given exercise to
be the muscle that you're targeting not
the other you know assistance uh muscles
so keep that in mind
next up zachary fiesel
cach there we go
i'm getting crushed with fatigue over
training before reaching the end of my
mesocycle
what are order of hierarchy of
modifications to make to the meso
to make the meso more survivable
potential solutions
programming additional rest days
decreasing frequency so
real quick uh this is covered explicitly
in the recovering from training book by
the way there's actually like a
a little there's an infographic that
literally has a hierarchy of what you
need to do in this situation
for sure well let's let's try to get a
little bit going here and then
if uh zachary if you want any more
insight then that's absolutely the book
to look at for you
uh potential solutions programming
additional rest days
decreasing frequency adding fewer reps
per week
uh i.e hard to stop
hard stop of one to two additional reps
no matter what may not actually lead to
decrease of r week to week
if adapting slash getting stronger so
that's not a good idea
shortening mezzo length currently at
four to one uh three to one significant
reduction in training
yes but it probably is equivalent in
terms of results or pretty close
slowing weekly set editions so i'll just
actually just talk about these as they
come
let's see program additional rest days
is totally fine
uh especially if you are training often
and the oftenness of the training is
burdensome so if you ever have the idea
in like week three
you look at your weekly schedule like
fuck i have so much training to do
and it's not that you look at the
training and you're like that's not a
lot of training but it's going to be
really hard
because if like you train for it four
times a week and each session is high
quality and super fucking hard and then
you're fucked up
reducing from there is not a good idea
but if you're trying to train like six
or eight times a week
maybe reducing is fine um which you can
also do which you didn't mention
is do priority deep priority uh so you
can train half your body really hard and
the other half kind of
having about on a back burner and then
even with more uh training days you just
aren't
really fucking up your whole body as
much and you know pay the cost fatigue
wise like that as a matter of fact
when someone reaches a state where they
can't get through their normal
cycle james and i sort of that's our
official cutoff of when you should start
considering specialization phases
priority phases and to put it another
way
if you come and tell james and i that
you've never run into systemic fatigue
ever
and you say should i do a specialization
phase we're going to be like not really
because you can probably just keep
growing all your muscles at the same
time
no big deal right um adding fewer reps
per week
remember we want quality first so you
add only as many reps per week as hits
your rr targets
so that's not really a negotiable um i
it is negotiable in like a cutting phase
under some extreme circumstances we're
making really notable trade-offs for
progress
but uh uh in favor of fatigue management
but look like if you want fatigue
management to be number one just to do
an arbitrary muscle length that's
fucking stupid so don't fuck with the
repetitions
um let's see shortening mezzo length you
can do that's totally fine but there are
other ways around of course that's your
like
line of last resort there slow slowing
weekly said editions
you don't want to slow weekly set
additions remember weekly stead edition
should always never
be auto regulator are you getting good
pumps are you getting disruption are you
healing on time
if the answer is yes don't add any sense
but if you are doing a certain number of
sets and you're like man i could be
recovering from like fucking way more
than this then it's time to start adding
sets
and how many do you add is enough to
start challenging yourself again to
where you're at you know
pushing your limits of recovery which is
you know you're getting all programs so
slowly weekly set additions is something
you can do again there's like
repetitions
on a cutting phase where just getting
through a long message cycle and
maintenance volume is priority
but for you for hyper uh normal hyper
females i wouldn't fuck with those i
would just auto regulate them
and then starting at lower starting set
volume is not a good idea because you
have to do whatever is your med or your
best approximate um
you know something james and i hate
seeing is so like hey notice you're
starting with three sets of quads
why do you start with three and they're
like well if i start with
five i can only go three weeks and then
i have to dealer like i got you
just three stimulate you they're like no
it feels like a warm up and then next
week's four
also warm up but like okay so for two
weeks you're not growing
you're training what the fuck are you
doing like
get in get out dealer when you have to
so
i would say the number one advice is
read the
book that we have on recovery from
training and it has much better
description
but i would say that first consider
specialization phases
if that doesn't remediate consider
additional rest days
um and just on the training end because
you can sleep and eat more and all this
will fix itself
and then only after that uh
should you consider shortening mezzo
length and then all these other things
unless you're pushing it way too hard
which you could be if you're pushing
appropriately hard adding reps
adding load appropriately hard adding
sets appropriately hard then you just
don't fuck with that because that's
that's the quality of what makes your
program
actually cause gauge instead of just
being able to say i did four weeks of
something
uh congratulations nobody gives a shit
i'll say this three weeks of high
quality training followed by a deload
beats the shit out of four weeks of low
quality training
any fucking time uh james yeah i liked
your responses i'm actually gonna go a
slightly different route because i think
zachary what you you're you're kind of
putting the cart before the horse so to
speak which means you're
fussing over the details before you've
really hammered down the basics
so when whenever you're having a
situation where you're kind of
prematurely
dealing with fatigue or overreaching
it's it really is a simple matter which
is you're just doing too much
right your volume landmarks are not in
order period that's just how that's just
the way it goes and that's the first
problem that you have to fix so all
these other things are basically ways of
like
how can i keep my fucked up basics and
circumvent the problem right and it's
just
it's just gonna end up leading back to
the same problems ultimately these are
things that you can do
but are not gonna have the effect that
you want because they're not powerful
enough to fix the bigger problem which
is that you're just doing too much so at
some point
you're going to have to reevaluate your
mevs and your mrvs and that's going to
be step one
right from there you can play around
with things like frequency and stuff
like that
what i would say is re-evaluate mev
re-evaluate your mrvs
and then also start looking at the sfr
of the exercises that you are choosing
you might just find that you are doing
things that are just wiping you out the
classic example for like an intermediate
lifter is like somebody who deadlifts a
lot you might just find like i just
can't do dead lifts anymore because they
just wipe me out and i can't
continue this week to week and that's
fine so
go back look at your basics go back look
at the exercises that you're choosing
and you might find that you're just
doing a lot of movement training and
garbage balling because the exercises
that you have picked are really just not
that stimulative for the muscles and
things that you're trying to train so
another example would be like if you
have really shitty bench press and
you're like well i'm doing
20 sets of chest per week and it just is
this kind of like nonsense right that's
that's just garbage at that point if you
have a really good
technique on your bench press or a
really good uh variation on the bench
press that is really good for you maybe
it's close grip bench
and you can dial in that close grip
bench to the point where you only need
two or three sets for an meb
that's what you want that also has a
downstream effect on your systemic
fatigue every week because you're doing
less sets to get the same amount of
robust growth stimulus
ta-da right those are like the big ones
that i would say i think like looking at
things like
should i be adding more reps it's like
you're already doing too many reps
that's the problem it doesn't matter
what you add weeks week at that point so
go back
and look at that basic stuff first i
think this is one of those instances
where you're looking at
the finer details before you've
addressed the core issues
okay next we have
notepad okay
did you find him i got oh you did uh
what is the intro warsaw packed beef
behind dr mike's persistent refusal to
credit any form of stifling and deadlift
to the romanians it's easy um the
romanians did not invent the romanian
deadlift they were using an exercise
that people in america had been using
for
generations and they came over and they
did a seminar and they were doing their
stuff like a deadlifts like they were
which many people in america already did
and then a couple of fucking retards in
attendance at the seminar were like hey
that's a real
weird way to do them even though people
have done them for a long time
and they're like they started the thing
well it was a romanian style romanian
deadlift and then they just
kept saying that and all of a sudden
people like
to say things like romanian deadlift
because it makes it exotic
um just regular stuff like a deadlift
isn't sexy
um also the romanian deadlift
uh or whatever you have
is the only proper way to do a
stiff-legged deadlift
um there are people who say that there's
multiple types of stiff-legged deadlifts
there aren't there's just one it is to
target your hamstrings and posterior
chain
you keep your knees just slightly bent
you hinge at the hip you keep your back
straight
you go down until you feel a deep
painful stretch and you come back up
that's it that's stuff like a deadlift
now do you start it from the ground or
touch to the ground do you start off
from a rack
that you know bench pressing from
your chest pausing at the chest or not
is still bench pressing it's just a
slight variant of bench pressing
so a lot of people think these are
different exercises and then there's
power lifters that try to do a
stiff-legged deadlift by
essentially almost locking out their
knees arounding their back and picking
up the weight
and i think they're just training wrong
they're just gigantic voided-up monsters
that do whatever they want which is
fine it's probably not a good idea for
you to do so there really is only the
stiff-legged deadlift
and it has some variations snatch grip
for example is a fine variation we don't
have to call it a different exercise
uh you know pull-ups have like 18
different variations of grip
and cadence and all the stuff we just
fucking call them pull-ups so yeah it's
not a romanian deadlift it's a fucking
stuff like a deadlift and the romanians
do it too
yeah i agree with dr mike so i've had
some colleagues in the past
try to differentiate the stiff legged
and the romanian as like the stiff
legged is your leg is
largely fully extended with a slight
bend the romanian
is a more pronounced bend which takes
the tension off the hamstring and puts
it on the glutes right i think that's
unique just exercise yeah exactly so i
think it's a needless differentiation
because it ends up just being a shitty
glute exercise
where you could just be doing a whole
bunch i would say like you could even
just do lunges at that point and get a
way better glute stimulus jesus christ
um so i think it's like a needless level
of differentiation
and if you're like i don't know i'm
trying to like
put this into words but like that's like
a needless
amount of technique variation on one
movement i don't
i don't see what the point of like
having that in your tool kit is if you
can already do a really good stiff
legged deadlift so
take it or leave it but i think it's
stupid yeah 100
next up is montes
pilipuches consistent deliverer of
excellent questions
it wasn't just luke wasn't yeah for sure
he was not a fluke
how can the stimulus-to-fatigue ratio of
various athletic events be determined
endurance running jumping
strength skill training the most
fundamental way
is it's actually very easy to measure
fatigue by performance reduction and
perceptive measure so that's easy now
the stimulus
is how uh
is often measured by performance as well
but it can be measured by how much
performance yield
something gives you uh and it can also
be measured by
how difficult it is and how far it
pushes your physiological systems
so for example just a really stupid
example just to illustrate a really
ridiculous example illustrate the point
if i have you do a slow long slow
distance
in heels okay literally like woman's
heels but they're they're rigged so that
they don't break
you would get an unbelievable amount of
knee pain and ankle pain and probably
break something
running for several miles like that and
then i could ask you like okay did you
get a huge crazy burn in your lungs
did you feel like your body systems were
really being pushed to the limit you're
like no my fucking ankles hurt okay
really low stimulus to fatigue ratio
that doesn't mean you have to even
measure performance yield
because you knew you wouldn't you
weren't even training hard
now the best thing was to fatigue ratios
are usually the ones which allow the
best in training performance yield
and detection of disruption of necessary
symptom systems
while at the same time keeping fatigue
low so if you give you really excellent
running shoes
and i design a program of interval
training for you and you do half hour of
uphill intervals
running you're gonna be fucked up like
your lungs are gonna be
burning you're gonna be pushing yourself
like crazy hitting pr's
if you measure power output and wattage
and stuff like that it's gonna be off
the charts you're going to be having
this unbelievable workout at the
during the workout but like how are your
joints connective tissues but actually
they're quite fine
and even though i'm there's a lot of
systemic fatigue for me having to try
hard
i'm comfortable in these shoes i love
the path that we're running on
and i'm super motivated to get this
workout done so i just i don't feel like
crushed psychologically or something
like 25 miles straight would crush me
uh right so a lot of times shorter
workouts end up having higher stimulus
to fatigue ratios
um with jumping you know are you getting
really good trajectories are you getting
really good technique and are you
hitting
multiple high jumps in the same session
and is feel his stuff feeling good do
your knees hurt
for strength uh i actually have a
breakdown of this on a graduate course
will be posted to youtube soon
but basically like are you producing
really high forces are you feeling the
groove
you guys know how few low bar squats
you're really grooved in it feels like
you're not even trying and you're
squatting 405 up and down you're like oh
my god you don't even know where the
power's coming from
someone's like what muscle is it working
like i don't know the fucking core
some kind of hip shit it's just i
breathe in and i feel so fucking tight
and you're grooving in there's no
misgrooving the deadlift bar never goes
away from you never comes too close to
you
when you're doing that and you're
registering the highest possible
uh you know performance and training or
very high performances that's a really
good stimulus you're just knocking out
of the park and of course fatigue is the
same
joint connective tissue rp stuff like
that skill training is a bit tougher
but you can sort of lean stimulus to
fatigue ratio based on of course how
fatiguing it is
but also uh you know part of fatigue
there is psychological fatigue is
frustration
if you have someone design a skill
training program for you that's just
frustrating and you
aren't able to harness the skills and
improve on them that's a shitty sfr
and you won't keep training very long
like that so for skill training do you
have
your is your skill training set up one
that progressively makes you better at
the skill
or feel more masterful at the skill as
the training session progresses
do you leave the training session and
you guys that have trained martial arts
for example or weightlifting know what
this is like
james you train rugby you know what this
is like you leave a really good
productive skill session and be like
dude i fucking know
more shit like i'm able to do more
things fluidly and dynamically
my emotions are better that's a great
stimulus whereas if you have a technique
session where you're like i don't know
things were yelled at me i sort of did
things i'm really tired my ankles hurt
that's a really crappy stimulus to
fatigue ratio james
yeah so i'm actually going to go a
slightly different route so it's
interesting
that you brought up like the skills idea
and really what we find is that's not so
much an issue of sfr
so much as like is the activity actually
scaled to your abilities and i actually
have made like an auto regulation
checklist for coaches
for skills and tactics activities based
on a couple different criteria and as
mike was saying like
when you're doing skill practice
sometimes you do get into a flow state
sometimes you do feel like oh this is
going so well
right that's because you are engaged you
have like a certain level of arousal
and you're able to hit your flow state
because the doses and intensities
are such that it's slightly above what
you're used to doing but within your
capability of doing right that's the
idea there so
the sports it's kind of hard to express
these things in terms of stimulus to
fatigue ratio monte so i really like
your question
i've been thinking about this a lot
lately because i've been working on my
other book
and one of the things that you run into
is ultimately it's what dr mike said
right is
the stimulus to fatigue ratio for all
activities is how much do you get out of
it relative to how much you put into it
the problem with sporting activities as
compared to bodybuilding is because
they're constrained by specificity so
for example
if you have to do a 5k and you just
happen to be a really good
marathon runner your best performances
are at like marathon level pace
but 5k pace sucks dick for you
are you gonna have really good sfr
training for a 5k
probably not why because it just doesn't
suit you well
now in bodybuilding you could just pick
something else and just say like this
sucks it doesn't work that well for me
but in this case you're constrained by
the actual sporting events that you're
trying to do
similarly you could say like okay i have
a basketball player they need to be able
to jump and dunk and rebound and to all
that stuff
well you can have them do all the broad
jumps and like single leg
sideways jumps in the world but
ultimately they have to jump
up straight up in the air and if they're
not good at it or if doing straight up
in the air jumps
doesn't tickle their pickle too bad
because that's what you got to do in
basketball so
ultimately you kind of have this problem
where there are things that are people
are better suited to doing
right and that could include sporting
activities unfortunately you have to
look at the outcome measurements you say
like well this is what you actually need
to do for basketball
right which is for example let's use the
example of jumping like what's going to
make you jumping
being strong being powerful and being
good at the actual
action of jumping like you have to train
those things there's only so much wiggle
room
to achieve those things within the
athlete right now you might say
well you could get strong doing high bar
squats low bar squats front squats
yes that's an example of where you could
look at the sfr
of an activity and the payout that
you're going to get from it but you're
still heavily constrained in that regard
so
i'm still thinking on this issue because
i think it's an interesting question
the biggest roadblock that you're going
to run into is the actual performance
outcome goals which is going to
constrain
whatever it is that you're trying to do
in training so it's a good question
and i really enjoyed it yeah yeah yeah
next up is greg proctor
[Music]
greg proctor
oh got it
greg proctor says asks rather
i'm so used to saying says because a lot
of our questions are just people saying
stuff
yeah or rp plus people just say things
and it's like sweet that is
sweet that you said that are grippers
like captain of crush a waste of time
is there any benefits any other benefits
uh developing crush grip just getting
better at the gripper bigger forms yes
sport performance or real world benefits
yes most of the time in the gym we are
generally improving
our support grip yeah some extent do
they complement each other yes
maybe getting better crushing you know
the barbell can aid in support of other
stuff yes
we'd like to hear your thoughts thanks
so basically like it's a dynamic way of
training your forearms
which is super great in addition to form
curls
gripping uh with a big range of motion
again you start out nice and wide and
close and crunch for a second
nice and wide close and crunch that can
be a really powerful hypertrophy
stimulus
and general grip strengthening stimulus
so like you know
while in wrestling for example a lot of
the strength is isometric as you express
it
you build most of your strength in the
gym for wrestling dynamically with
weightlifting movements and barbell
movements
so just the same way even if you just
want an isometric crushing grip
doing repetitions on the gripper is
going to get you bigger forms and a
whole lot of that grip that transfers to
a lot of stuff
and remember that reps
are the way to build a lot of people
make this big mistake
they'll use the gripper only as a tester
or they'll after a whole session of
something else they'll use the gripper
and they'll
but yeah i close the number one two or
three times in each hand and i'm out how
the fuck
do you expect results when you do two or
three reps of something
for a workout once a week or your
fucking mind train it two to four times
a week
maybe you can train it fresh because
it's easy to train fresh you don't even
need to go to the gym
and do sets of whatever the sfr is best
whatever the pump is best for
hypertrophy and for strength so that's a
five to ten
so that here's what a set of five looks
like on a gripper you have the gripper
you go
one controlled eccentric
two controlled eccentric three just like
that you do five to ten
it's gonna fuck your ass up and it's
gonna improve a ton of stuff
treat your grip training like you train
normal training treat the gripper like
you treat
any other bodybuilding machine period
yeah totally agree and the thing with
them like you said you do train your
grip a lot during training but
there is just kind of a plateauing
effect there where your grip is only
going to get so much stronger after
years and years and years of doing
regular training and at that point like
the amount of grip strength you gained
per time spent doing other things
it's just piss-poor and if you want to
improve your grip strength from that
point on you're going to have to move on
to doing direct grip training as mike
said
that usually comes from doing
repetitions of either forearm training
or in this case like the crusher
uh all of those are great options but
you can't expect
that you can train it differently and
get the same results like uh you know
a lot of people think that's the same
thing about apps like and i think i
largely blame
the arnold's modern uh encyclopedia of
bodybuilding because he stopped a whole
lot of bullshit in there about training
abs twice a day and this and that
and it's like uh yeah that's that's cute
but
ultimately all of your muscles respond
in largely and i say when i say largely
i'm meaning
virtually the same way with some kind of
differences in fiber typing and stuff
like that but ultimately
most muscles respond in the same way to
training so you would treat your
forearms or your abs
just like any other muscle group yeah
abraham lincoln what
rise from your grave
got him all right
how big is the difference in gaining
cutting and maintaining weight over a
strength block
on long-term progress or strength goals
here are some assumptions
right here's some assumptions for these
scenarios assume in all cases that the
recommended maintenance phase has been
completed following um
a massing phase and i've only gained 500
body weight during the massing phase
this is
also assuming that all three cases you
want to get back to a similar body fat
level as pre mass body fat before doing
another massive phase
so a cut will have to happen at some
point in all cases does it make sense
for long-term progress to cut before
starting a strength block
cutting during the strength block or
waiting until after a strength block to
cut again
in the case of the hypocaloric strength
block uh
you would take the recommended month of
maintenance calories after the mass just
like the couple for a strength block
or maybe a bonus scenario you just spend
your first four or six weeks of the
strength block i saw galoreca and the
remaining let's say roughly six or so
weeks hypocaloric
then finish off any fat loss after the
cycle uh
before massing again so uh abraham
mr lincoln rather president lincoln
yeah show some respect yeah for real how
dare i
um i'm going to say this it's going to
be meant with all due respect
this is not a character so we have to
say that relatively often
um there are there's a conflation of two
goals here
one is uh bodybuilding style training
and one is strength training
you have to figure out which one you
want more of
and then we can help you with your
question
generally speaking for all applications
strength blocks during fat loss are a
bad idea so just don't do it
if you have to do it do it as slow as
possible and remember you fucked up
having to do it a big part of strength
even more than hypertrophy is being able
to sequence progressively harder
workouts and having a really good uh
preparedness the entire time but the
preparedness you need to
to get high quality bodybuilding
workouts is not very high like right now
i'm at the tail end of our cut i go to
the gym and i just like yell at the
weights and
just do reps and it's fine but also
staying on my body with strength
you don't show up and you're like oh i'm
feeling kind of beat up let's do lap
pull downs instead of pull ups no no
you have to do low bar squat and you
have to do 505 pounds because last week
you did 4.95
like it has to go for five reps that has
to
adds up to where you had better be
fucking eating on the other hand
surplus during a straining phase is
often not a great idea in the long term
because it results in too much fat
accrual just get fat now your strength
block will go fucking amazing
if you're hypercaloric during you you'll
get the best strength gains of your life
however you'll also be a fat piece of
shit afterwards and you'll have to spend
time not gaining strength and reducing
the fat also
some of the strength gains you'll get
will just be from anatomical differences
like your chest will thicken from body
fat your bench will go up it doesn't
really evaluate your
it doesn't fundamentally may not
actually have improved your pushing
strength
as soon as you lose the fat it goes back
down and leaving you uh with at least a
lack of conclusion about what worked and
what didn't
so we highly highly recommended rp
strength
and maintenance go like peas and carrots
like jenny
free heroin and forrest gump and then
and then significantly after heroin uh
not tumultuous 70s jenny she doesn't go
well with anybody
i'm biting my tongue there was many
jokes i wanted to make but easy james
yes
so okay so uh peas and carrots
maintenance and strength
that's the fucking best way to go if
you're massing
of hypertrophy training if you're
cutting hypertrophy training
that's the best we can give to you now
the way you're sequencing your blocks
i can't tell if strength is number one
priority or not so for example
you gained five to ten percent body
weight during a massing phase
okay and then you're saying uh i'm going
to want to cut this body fat off well if
you're truly strength oriented
you kind of don't give a shit you gain
some muscle and some fat
and then for months and months and
months you can just do blocks of
strength eating fucking gnarly strong
and there's going to be some recap there
too at the end of that process when you
have the strength
then you could be like okay i'm in like
an interesting body fat situation how do
i get rid of it and then the answer is
probably like a six to eight week
hypertrophy
uh mesocycle or block and then you get
rid of all the body fat during that time
and then you thread back into strength
you regain all of your lost neural
strength and technique over a period of
two months
and then you're lean and strong and then
you can do a peeking phase or you can do
another mass phase or whatever
um so because of the way you said this
abraham i may be misjudging you and
absolutely my apologies if i did it
seems like as soon as you're getting fat
here or
fatter you're like yeah yeah strength
good i have to do that but i really got
to get this fat off if that's how you're
thinking that's 100 plants i think
then you're really doing more
bodybuilding stuff and then you don't
need to do any strength phases
you can just do a hypertrophy phase
right then after you gain the shit
so your hypertrophy to gain re-sensitize
hypertrophy to lose
then you're back at a lean amount of uh
or a lean situation and then you can
start training for strength if you so
choose
it's just one of those like if your
number one concern after gaining mass is
that you got fat
you're not a strength athlete uh if you
are a strength athlete then that just
comes with the game you have to plan to
get rid of it you can get rid of it up
front but you're probably better off
getting rid of it later after you've
milked a shitload out of that new body
james
yeah those are all really good points
and just another thing too is kind of
what's
contributing to our confusing uh
perspective
is if you are a strength athlete you are
most likely a weight class
sport athlete and so gaining like 10 of
your body weight at any given time would
indicate
you're you're not really taking your
weight class very seriously so there is
that idea of like
just getting bigger and stronger over
time and maybe you're not concerned
about competing in a weight class but
then like what is the
what is the goal if it is strength
because usually if it's strength it
means you're doing powerlifting
weightlifting
maybe strongman but most likely
powerlifting or weightlifting and those
are weight class and yada yada so yeah
it's just
not entirely sure where you're going it
sounds like you're going more of a
bodybuilding route and you just also
want to be strong as a bonus and that's
a totally fine thing to do but you do
have to kind of pick one
um next up
heinrich anderson wait hold on
how do you pronounce this name right
here can you see this
oh shit i clicked on it fuck no
god damn it find abraham again and it'll
it'll pop up
yes this guy's name
uh let me zoom in on your screen so i
can actually read it
so my best guess i'm not so good at the
slavic pronunciations because they got
weird shit going on but from if i was
russian and i know a little bit of the
slavic stuff
uh ismar uh
oh very nice very nice
that looks that looks right to me i have
no we got all those weird little tilde
c bullshits yeah i'm not gonna bitch
because in russia we have a whole
fucking alphabet
all right who is that next one uh henrik
anderson
han rick
james how well do you remember um
[Music]
rik
there we go got him uh how old do you
remember
uh die hard the first one
not that well
there was an uh one of the terrorist
name was heinrich and he had the
detonators
uh that's when i was first introduced to
uh the actor who was in uh what the fuck
is his name
love actually cast uh i could have just
done diehard cast
uh uh
alan rickman oh yeah yeah and alan
rickman
is such a good actor that like other
people acting is like an insult to the
man like
if he was still alive and they were like
hey you want to do a movie without
recording you're like
absolutely not worthy of you guys out of
your fucking minds okay a real actor
yeah anyway all right henrik anderson
says how come my reps drop about 20
for every set even though i rest for a
long time i usually do alternating sets
between antagonistic muscle groups
backwards two and a half minutes chest
rest repeat in total five to six minutes
of rest for the muscle itself
i thought to myself i probably just have
fast push muscle fibers but the same
time the last three or four reps of most
exercises are grinders no cheating
perform breakdowns
what is going on here thanks a lot in
advance what's going on here is fatigue
fatigue comes from a variety of sources
not just the type of muscle fiber you
have
there is central nervous system fatigue
peripheral nervous system fatigue
cytokine mediated fatigue there is
intramuscular energy stored fatigue
there is intramuscular um metabolite
uh generation so for example you could
have metabolites like processes of
muscle contraction or
sorry the um the waste products the
muscle contraction literally clogging up
the space between the neuron that talks
to your muscle and tells it to fire
and the actual muscle which is bullshit
i mean so the fraction of times the
actual shit goes through oh hold on a
sec
deliberate
my cleaning people up here you guys like
that spanish
collegiate level high school level below
high school level
all right uh so in any case you can
literally have
a situation in which you have like
problems with the nerve talking to the
muscle
which is another thing that happens when
you get really close to failure on a
related note
people think that muscle activation
radically skyrockets as you approach
failure in a single set that's actually
not
true brett knuckles had a really good
explanation on the stronger by science
podcast about how that works
um basically your muscles get tired
everything gets fucked up right the more
that you get into
uh the situation and then and then what
that leads to is it's just fatigue
so it is there's there's like 10 at
least 10 known sources of fatigue
um here's another one real quick james i
can't believe i missed this one you run
out of creatine phosphate
and that shit takes like a long time to
buffer back to normal
uh glycogen every set you do there's
less glycogen left over
so your body's really good about
detecting glycogen and kind of capping
off it like yeah you should like
let's not perform just as hard as you
just did so all of that stuff the entire
system gets frayed gets frayed gets
uh my best analogy here is i've been
watching a lot of world war two
documentaries is imagine you sent
a fully staffed fully supplied division
into combat
and they won and they come back now
imagine that the the course of resupply
takes the full resupply would be two
weeks that means you replace all the
broken tracks on the vehicles
you get all the food now the food comes
in a couple hours broken tracks on
vehicles two weeks
right and then a week later you're asked
to go fight another battle again what is
your performance gonna be like well you
know two of our tanks are out
we have 12 total tanks now we have 10
and someone could be like what the fuck
you guys just see we got two weeks why
aren't you at full strength
there's some shit just takes fucking a
long time and believe it or not battle
really fucks shit up so say you know and
if you rest a very little time that's
like not being able to resupply for food
or for sleep oh sorry one sec
uh james please take over whatever i
missed but basically you get tired and
there's nothing wrong with that
yeah yeah i think dr mike hit it pretty
much on the head there so especially
when you're doing the reciprocal kind of
antagonist style supersets
one of the problems that you can run
into is you start running into like
cardiovascular or systemic fatigue
spillover which just starts capping
everything so
one of the things that we know is like
the more kind of cardiovascularly
challenging
you make any given exercise or session
or activity
the more likely it's going to start
having systemic fatigue limitations and
that's just the way it goes
so you might actually be resting like
what would otherwise be adequately long
per muscle group so you said like you're
roughly about five minutes per muscle
for the actual whether it's chest or
it's back like that ends up getting five
minutes of rest per set
that's true but you're doing all this
other bullshit at the same time so as
dr mike mentioned there's a lot of
different sources of fatigue one of them
is just the cardio and systemic fatigue
spillover from doing a lot of things in
a short amount of time so at that point
you basically have a really high
training density
which is going to tax again the central
system is a little bit harder like your
cardio
your ability and willingness to make
actual efforts because your rir is
creeping up a little bit more and more
just because of
all the other stuff you got going on and
that's normal i wouldn't really sweat it
too much but the more dense the training
is per unit of time
the more fatigue that it's going to
generate and then the more the reps are
going to drop off that's just
completely normal i wouldn't sweat it at
all guys imagine what
would happen if it if you noticed that
didn't happen to you
because a lot of people come in with the
default assumption
that you shouldn't be getting tired
between sets what the fuck
can you guys imagine doing a set of 10
in the squat super hard racking a bit
all right then another set of 10 okay
then another set
fucking five hours later you're still
doing sets of ten you're like oh my
fucking god i have super powers
i don't get tired how the fuck would
that work
and a lot of times i think james like
culturally what really conflates this
problem
is the three by ten three by five four
by ten type of split
but that necessarily means your rir
is much higher in the first sets than it
is in the last
so your rar4 on the first set of 10 is
r1 on the last set if it's the same load
so don't assume the normality of
straight sets because that's abnormal
that is artificial that is literally
caricatured out of thin air by people
who just wanted some kind of constancy
true same rir multiple sets you will get
tired there's no damn thing fucking
wrong with that period
yeah i forgot who asked this was it
heinrich who has this one yeah
so heinrich like i would say this is a
perfectly fine way to train for most
people because they might have time
constraints and they just got to get in
and out as
efficiently as they can if somebody who
is not necessarily constrained by time
and you want to be like the most
buff physique guy that you can be
probably not the best way to train
though still not terrible um just
because you are going to start to see
performance drop-offs that you would
otherwise not see if you just did a set
and just took the rest that you needed
for that muscle only and then hit it
again so
i'm guessing you're doing it because you
have like an hour lunch break and this
is how when you train and you got to get
as much training in as you can
if that's the case that's perfectly fine
keep doing what you're doing
i'm lee 888 i am l e
e and then the mark of the beast plus 2
122 iml
sorry i clicked everything except for
what i needed to there we go got it
for glutes should my wife focus more on
sumo deadlifts and hip thrusts
or conventional and atg squats
uh or conventional deadlifts i think he
means squats
asking for her i think i already know
the answer but she never listens to me
emily you don't have a fucking
wife you're on youtube dog you're
married to nobody your hand's not your
wife
get the fuck out of here that's like
every now and again people try to razz
me on instagram
all in good fun they're like whoa doctor
mike you're posting glute shots my
girlfriend was looking at my phone like
what girlfriend get out of here get out
of here
all right you got me um but i'm stealing
your girl
with my glutes that's right that's right
she's like oh my god who's this
um here's the deal the shitty rp
canned answer is the best sfr exercises
win
which is great yeah it's a great answer
flesh questions
she just uh ask your wife where she's
feeling them which exercises give her
the best tension in the glutes
which ones give her the best burn in the
glutes which ones give her the best pump
in the glutes and which ones
feel like they're disrupting her glutes
a lot so for example i think james and i
are on a similar page here but i'll just
speak for myself and see how james feels
about him
four hip thrusts mechanistic or so
mechanically they're really good for a
lot of people
a lot of people swear by them and i
believe that they work because they have
to work mechanically it's high
involvement of glutes
when i do them i've done them for
multiple mesocycles before
my stimulus proxies just suck like i
don't i sort of feel some tension in my
glutes not a ton
only at the very peak um it takes a lot
for me to feel a burn in my glutes but
but then like
the fronts and tops of my quads are
burning so it's kind of not even a
limiting factor
uh as far as pump like i get a little
bit of a pump my glutes nothing super
crazy like it's fine but it takes
a lot of sense to get the pump and then
i really just never get sore from it so
the disruption is just
seemingly like almost absent it doesn't
even feel that weak afterwards so i'm
like okay i don't know what's going on
now
i do a few sets of walking lunges with
weight and my shift
fucked up beyond recognition unreal
tension in the glutes the entire time
crazy burning the glutes to where i'm
like dying
enormous pump where you feel like a
fucking like horse back there
and then the disruption is so profound
that it actually
catches me at what james and i call
perturbation like your muscle's broken
there's something
wrong with it like it's not dom's you're
not sore yet it's like five minutes
after and you have trouble getting up
out of a chair
and your glutes are going they like have
benign fasciculation you're like
something's wrong something was
stimulated something was targeted
so for me lunges are the top of the
fucking pile for this but that may not
be the case with your wife
some people get really great glute
workouts from conventional deadlifting
and astrograph squatting
some people get just incomparable shit
from sumo deadlifts and hip thrusts
you got to try them all and you got to
get your wife to give you sfr proxies
and of course fatigue like which one
hurts your joints and so on and so forth
which one feels really really hard
i'll say this conventional deadlifts
feel really hard they don't hit your
glutes all that well usually because the
range of motion isn't that great
sumo deadlifts especially deficit sumo
deadlifts
uh are just an excellent exercise for
the glutes because they do give you that
range of motion
and it's a compound lift and the sfr is
usually just higher
so uh the perceived exertion is not that
high because
it's not that much weight in your hands
but it's a crazy long range of motion so
you you're not on the axial loading
isn't nuts you know james like when you
pull on a conventional device if you're
like where do you feel i don't know it's
just heavy like i'm getting really tired
my spine hurts
i think there's blood in my body but
then you do sumo deficit poles
and if you do them for sets of like you
know five to ten even
no one rep is like the end of the world
but you're like man this range of motion
is killer my glutes are fucked up but
your spine feels fine like that's kind
of what you wanted on my perch if you
move
which actually dovetails into our next
question about save that for after
james's commentary james what do you
think
yeah so the short version like our mike
hardy said is uh it's always
sfr i would say just based on my
experience
like 75 of people my go-to
for glute specific stuff would be like
lunges uh
sumo deadlifts and the hip thrusts but
that doesn't mean it's the end-all
be-all
some people respond differently but
those would definitely be like if i was
to start somewhere
that's where i would start if i wanted
to have like a really heavy glute
emphasized mesocycle
start with those go from there
last stop is lean gains
oh mean gains
oh what this is is that
he's got an icon a mosquito i can't it
looks like it's a guy with like a middle
finger sticking
up i can't tell i always think of lean
gains
he's got some good comments on other
videos i always think of him as a
mosquito
so that's what he gets maybe he is
mosquito i can't tell
all right lean gains asks how would you
structure sumo deadlifts into a
hypertrophy program
i really like them and want them to be
my main quad and glute
uh on leg days they will never be quad
and glute because they're dogs you're
quite exercise so you gotta
we'll just throw that one away for you
what was that called that rick and morty
pulling off that band-aid early
yeah um are they as
are they as fatiguing as conventional to
a point where they can affect workouts
yes and should i use other stuff maybe
or can they be considered hypertrophy
exercise well so here's the thing they
can for sure be considered a purchase
exercise
but just like a goku explained about the
super saiyan ascension it has to come
from a need not a desire
same thing from stimulus to fatigue
ratio look i want to do fucking dildo
presses but there's nowhere in my
program where they have a good sfr
slash they don't target muscles that i
need so i
i won't do them and lean gains again all
with all due respect
we've all been down this road before um
trying to rig your hypothermia program
to justify doing certain exercises
is got the car literally the cart before
the horse
like the horse is bad at pushing the
cart just have them pull it
your hypertrophy program logic should be
pulling the exercises along
you don't smash an exercise up front
regard i got to do this how do i fuck
the rest of my hypertrophy program now
look if you were a client of ours paying
client you know you said look this is
non-negotiable i have to have this
we could work a hybrid program around it
we'll tell you right now how we would do
that
we would almost certainly tell you to
try to do deficit sumo deadlifts
uh because the range of motion and the
activation of the glutes at the bottom
is super great
we'd have to do them in sets of 5 to 10
or 10 to 15 reps we'd have to do them
um probably in a real bodybuilding
context after
some sets of lunges and hip thrusts so
that your glutes are really pre-fatigued
you don't have to use as much weight
and then you would do that ideally only
once a week maybe twice a week with
different rep ranges but really you
would limit that pretty significantly
because it's super fucking taxing anyway
and then the rest of your work would
come from other stuff so that's how
that's the answer to your exact question
but i think the better answer i'm sure
james a little more to say about this is
can you justify putting in exercises and
rigging the rest of your programmer yeah
you can totally we're all human and
sometimes just want to fucking have fun
with an exercise you like
but be careful because that road does
lead you to good and bad places
it just you don't want to close your
eyes down that road and take your hands
off the steering wheel and all of a
sudden
end up with a program in which you're
doing a bunch of lifts that you like but
you don't have any results to show for
it and someone's like dude how come your
glutes haven't come up really because
i've been ignoring the good exercises i
know have good sfrs
to do exercises i like come on like that
doesn't make any goddamn sense so
careful yeah i totally agree with dr
mike here and another problem that you
run into with these exercises that you
like
is maybe they do have a good sfr and
that's groovy but then you're like okay
i've really been
been grooving on these these sumo
deadlifts i'm gonna build my next
hypertrophy mesocycle
around it well guess what happens you
know around like week six
of sumo deadlifts that you've now been
doing collectively for several months
because you really enjoyed them
and you just started a new program with
them they've gone flat
ah now what like now you have to
strategically vary them out and you've
built this ridiculous program around
this one exercise because it has so many
different constraints
and now you're really having to juggle a
lot of different things as a result of
having to switch out this one
fucking movement right so it's okay to
do that
but the problem that you get is if it
goes stale on you now you've just made
your whole program around this one
movement
and you're basically having to start
over so that kind of sucks because now
you're not going to be carrying any
momentum
for the rest of your mesocycles because
you're literally having to switch so
many things around and maybe you can
have some things stay largely the same
and that's great
but it's just such a fuss so i would say
uh like mike said again it's putting the
cart before the horse like
pick the things that train what you want
really well and like yeah you can cycle
back to some of those movements that you
like but don't make them
never make one exercise the focal point
of a program even power lifting
you can only pick you have to pick three
you can't pick one
um sorry oh i thought mike was flagging
me down
right you got squat bench and deadlift
at least that's more than one uh
weightlifting you got snatch and clean
and jerk which is really like
i guess a couple different exercises if
you think about it but anyways for
bodybuilding you don't need to be that
constricted i think it's just a big
waste of your time
100 that's it
that's all 10. okay so we've got some
some good news folks again thanks for
your questions
and some bad news uh so i
uh started doing my final pass on the
final version of the hypertrophy book so
i'm hoping to
have any comments hopefully i won't have
any but if anything comes up i'm hoping
to have those by the end of the week
that'd be pretty cool so that's good
news
yep and then after that i do my final
pass and
[Music]
the book is done your final pass at the
same time for time purposes but
yeah yeah it's done almost done which is
great
um anything else mike you got going on
nothing i'm going to talk about until it
happens oh
cryptic i like the double the double
wink
if you guys are gamers i just picked up
subnautica and it's really awesome
highly recommend it's
easy easy way to lose yourself like five
hours at a time it's very immersive
yeah yeah it's just one of those games
you start playing and then you look at
the clock and you're like fuck
i spent all day playing this game jesus
what system is that on
i think it's on a bunch of platforms i'm
playing it on ps4 uh
and it's pretty awesome when does the
ps5 come out it's out
oh are you excited is it getting good
reviews or what
uh it's it's really early on and a lot
of people haven't been able to get their
hands on once so uh but so far most of
the reviews seem like it's really
awesome the the tech is really good
the interfaces are really good there's
not a lot of games out and not a lot of
the games have taken advantage of some
of the new hardware features so like
mike you like this one
one of the features is on the controller
where it has um
the trigger that you know like on the
back of the controller that usually is
used to shoot
for things um it actually has a
different response for different guns so
you can set the tension on the trigger
differently so like a rocket launcher in
a game will have a different trigger
pull than like uh
stuff like that so there's a bunch of
like really wild features out there that
are really interesting but it's again
it's like
it's the hardware but the game
developers have to make software that
takes advantage of the hardware so we'll
see
totally that's crazy so yeah if you guys
are interested in games check that out
i think that's about it for me folks
