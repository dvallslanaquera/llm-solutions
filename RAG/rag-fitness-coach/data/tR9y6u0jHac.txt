because a lot of people ask like what do
I need to be doing in the gym to grow
more and I look him up and down I'm like
motherfucker you built like Harry Potter
how much you eating there's no amount of
training that's going to get you from
120 lb to 150 lb because it's not a
training problem it's a fucking eating
problem and unless you become the most
jacked 120 pounder in the world you got
to eat so the first thing is getting
enough protein roughly a gram per pound
per day really really swell idea cuz if
you eat a lot of food but it's not a lot
of protein you're just going to get
fatter and you be like Dr Mike fuck me
over I'm just a fat piece of shit now
and Kelsey the Android girl from school
still won't face with me that's what she
calls it strange gr per pound per day
