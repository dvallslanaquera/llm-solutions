up rest
breathe ah one by one two sets of one
let's go move
[Music]
it me I'm Dr Mike but you already know
that and y'all M fuckers has been dming
you left and right leave in comments get
will Tennyson on the channel Will's so
great he's my hero his hair is perfect
you guys could have great gy energy
together well good you
succeeded oh my God fellas Hey listen
thank you it's better than I could have
ever imagined it is there's just one
problem we're going to hurt each other
today maybe emotionally definitely
physically it's like day wartime
fellas let's do it
[Music]
[Music]
lying leg curl you guys will see I put
two pads down the reason for this is
that this free motion leg curl machine
is a fine machine there is a way to
enhance it you extend this and what ends
up happening is
your hamstrings at the very bottom get
stretched way more because your hips are
elevated thus the relative angle of this
is deeper and we know from a good amount
of scientific research at this point and
a lot of personal experience that if you
really stretch a muscle under load the
hypertrophic response is just way better
but it also fucks you up way more what
kind of rep range the first set is a
straight set of 19 reps after warm-ups
the second set is however many mini my
rep sets to get to 19 of course to get
to 19 again okay and uh getting to 19 my
PE Officer says that's a very poor
phrasing I should stop using given my
criminal
[Music]
past well you got
[Music]
20 what the
fuck dude if I'm known for anything on
the internet you known for going to
failure man I'm known for quitting early
it turns out I'm not a man I'm a bitch
and that began to hurt me and I dude
that's actually unacceptable I'm
actually disappointed in you you had
like 25 30 even maybe you why fuck 40
why'd you stop the fuck is wrong with
this I don't know if I'm there like MTV
like ashon
Kutcher
what two
more fuck yeah touch that
butt yes two more you got
this yep and one last one good technique
only milk this one out as if you're
going to do another slow control gentle
that's
it now that's trying someone has to do
it fuck I do have an explanation for why
I train High train the app programs me
to hit mini PRS
if I just get the mini PRS I know I'm
not losing muscle I'm probably gaining a
bit and that's all I need could I drain
myself and get a few more reps totally
another thing is this is week two of my
four-week program I don't go close to
failure until week four okay so and the
last thing is is that I've experimented
many times in the past I actually used
to train everything to failure every
workset to concentric failure when I
started going shy of failure I just got
better results don't ever fucking come
in my gym and then something me like
hello
5 to 10 seconds right
yeah three more let's go 17 come on all
the way up touch the
butt come on let's go touch the butt
nice there it is oh yeah slow slow WTH
rest got three more take your time take
your time
we're no no that's totally fine two my
reps is totally great
yep slow and then one last
one boom slow as if you're going to do
another one milk it milk it gentle
touch
perfect oh will how old how old are you
I'm 29 29 a good age for you it's like a
wine yeah
perfect
enough enough seeing the world to be a
little jaded but still some hope in
their eyes at that age once they cross
the 30s they're like dead yeah oh fuck
me weird to walk yeah oh man this is
going to be hell this one you're going
to do you're doing just great fuck you
have like a fridge frame though thank
you yeah that's a big
compliment it's like like no I mean like
you're just like fucking built and like
stocky will said I look like a
refrigerator but like in the best way
possible here's the acting coming into
play nine one more there it is
slow come on
breae
ah okay why you take okay I got these
shirts it says leg don't you notice that
there's some like weird spacing right
here some because as we sweat it's
supposed to spell legendary how are you
supposed to sweat if you're being a
bitch I don't think I am legendary but
we got to get wet and it spell it's
going to spell the rest of oh we'll get
wet we we'll get wet don't you worry
about
that slow control and that's it relax
let's rest long enough to get about four
or five here okay look at that gorgeous
hair Jesus Christ you can touch it if
you
want the hair or just the rest
of
easy yep one more left make it high
quality yes
slow control control and you're
done dude brilliant excellent excellent
going to dab me like oh like that yeah
yeah you know what reassure me that I
did a good job just give you a hug I'm
always weird about like the degree of
touch like me too threw me off
completely like if I'm around females
bitch I ain't touching you for nothing
your boy not going away again um I'm
like a stress ball man just come oh my
God I did hamstrings feel quite awful
which I'm happy about good good yeah
they feel uh they feel like somewhat
stimulated maybe or warmed up
next we are going to do leg
[Music]
presses but what I like to do is warm up
with body weight squats because then we
don't have to put the little plates on
the leg press we could just cook a
pretty decent amount so let's come over
here and we'll go in front of the mirror
together we'll just do buddy squat I
just got to ask real quick what's this
what's going on here oh yes the fuck
well
uh these are just wooden blocks that
elevate myself and my wife she's a short
queen I'm a short King and so this
allows us to use the otherwise
excellently designed Atlantis linear leg
press to get a super deep stretch at the
bottom that's really cute yeah so we
will take whatever stance is similar to
a leg press stance maybe even a little
bit wider and then hands go up or like
this and then you squat super slow and
all the way down now I got something
fucked up I'm going to need to sit on
plates I have no ankle Mobility oh
you're one of
those we have a solution for you what
this is it this is my typical
ready oh what a what a disaster now
we're in business
see yep slow and
controlled pause at the bottom and come
up and do a sum total of about 15 of
these and then that gets our quads nice
and warmed
up to start leg pressing with a bit of a
heavier warmup
my knees are man you're feeling it oh my
knees yeah oh cuz your knees are fucked
up yeah what happened to your knees a
lot of time on them
yeah you want to put your knee sleeves
on for the leg press what you think of
me if I do that I think so little of you
already it just doesn't matter okay
[Music]
yeah
super deep leg presses there's a trick
here it's not much of a trick it's
always trick with you right it's
terrible yeah myor reps and bottom 2/3
only until you need to rest for the myor
so you're going to knock them out come
up two-thirds of the way just when it
starts to get easier you go right back
down slow and controlled with a gentle
pause at the bottom as low as you can go
until the heels like while while the
heels still stay on the pad right
perfectly said
lock rack your Mobility is crazy oh
thanks so much while I'm cheating cuz I
have weightlifting shoes on Wow have you
considered weightlifting shoes I have
them I usually I usually train my legs
and these or socks dude for ankle
Mobility only weightlifting shoes ever
touch my
body let's
go nice one
[Music]
more what that
ouch
hit it slow control do/ thirds down ah
down slow pause up and lock
W good shit
man fuck I wanted 17 so
bad just think fuck only uh oh only two
more of them
fuck I I shouldn't believe in myself as
much as I do it's just hurting me fuck
don't give up on me now I'm not just
fuck
me I think the leg press just did that
for
us down yes slow no rushing these slow
right off the bat slow slow slow push

lot of you left is there all right a
second you know what's fucked up I think
I train legs hard yeah fuck holy
fuck dude that was
dope good shit that was hella dope mad
mad Wicked
dope all right
lunges I'm going to warm up really quick
and then I'll watch your warm-ups just a
six steps you need to warm up after this
uh well yeah so that's actually a really
good question and I will address that on
the video camera after your muscles are
already warmed up and you're on your
later exercises for muscles you've
already warmed up which for us glutes
lower back adors and quads are super
warm I like to do at least one set Jay
Cutler actually had the best term I've
ever heard for this not sport scientist
but nonetheless very opt a feel set you
don't want to get into this with real
weight
and have the first couple reps like oh
my body's getting used to lunges yeah so
this set you can kind of Judge what your
working set going to be to a part of
that absolutely but since the rpop app
already told me what I'm doing I just
have to warm up to it so I take six or
eight nice long lunge steps with just
body weight first couple feel honestly
like total shit next couple feel okay
last couple feel decent and then I get
on this and it's all hunky to 22
repetitions each step is a rep so oh
fuck so 11 11 11 back yeah something
like that I usually do like 12 and 10
and then how many you reps how many STS
sorry fuck I'm going to do two yeah you
should also do too I
agree now you how many one
more nice and easy set it up again you
got this will slow control you're in
charge slow
up go and
Rack you're good
perfect what you get the hang of like my
first few were sketchy and you get the
hang of it gravy it was really fucking
good is this the last set of the day
coming out yes holy shit not a very long
workout wow that's your that's your
thing right short and effective um you
[Music]

done yep slow controlled last one got to
be
good yes walk it
in all right come on back a little
quickly while the quads are still fresh
here's what I want you to do will okay
so you're going to stay right off of
this like that toes pointed out squat
technique you're going to get your hands
up you're going to slowly control the
Ecentric you're going to sit here for
two whole seconds you're going to come
up only 2/3 of the way slowly control
and sit when you can't do that anymore
I'm going eat a common lock breathe for
a bit and then repeat we'll tell you

[Music]
shit for the grham
huh you got to teabag me
man
fuck sorry Mr
Thomson that was fucking dope that was
dope man that shit was fun huh
dude that's fucking
great I love that man so really not that
much exercise selection just three
exercises just three so people think
they have to do like fucking 20 24 sets
for the legs you don't really have to do
I mean they might but this is a hard
enough workout for me to only be able to
recover from twice a week I suspect
based on your current personal
experience is likely similar for you uh
if someone's like can you do this
workout but with you know 10 extra sets
total you'd be like dude what because
you could you could survive it but the
question isn't about what you can
survive it's what you can recover from
for at least twice a week when you train
legs we need get these shirts wet CU I
want to water or
semen whatever you prefer SE is mostly
water anyway isn't it
folks we're juicy oh he's drug free so
he can only get so juicy but I want vein
like that yeah you got to use a lot of
drugs possible for me I mean how much
