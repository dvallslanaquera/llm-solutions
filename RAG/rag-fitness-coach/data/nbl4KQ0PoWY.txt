hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
here we go
you asked for it maybe
we provided it a lower chest priority
specialization growth program we're
going to talk about the theory of why we
should specialize give some really good
recommendations give you a sample
program to try
and hook you up with a few resources to
expand your knowledge further and get
you super jacked lower chest
to fill out the bra of course why else
would you train your lower chest i will
say before starting that
the lower chest isn't something a lot of
people tend to prioritize because
aesthetically upper chest looks kind of
cooler it gives you that upper uh
armor-plating look also just from
regular flat pressing a lot of times
people have pretty dominant lower chests
and their upper chest tend to lag
however in some cases having a bit more
rounding and filling out of the lower
chest especially if you have some loose
skin on there can be aesthetically very
awesome i actually have a weaker lower
chest compared to upper chest this is
pretty pertinent to me but maybe you're
one of these folks and you could get
something out of this program so
first up real quick
why would we want to specialize why not
just train everything normally well
there's really kind of two reasons first
you just want one muscle group to grow
more in relation to the others like
you're obsessed with having a big lower
chest or biceps or shoulders totally
cool reason
and the other reason to specialize even
if you want everything to grow the same
is that if you decrease how much you're
training other muscles
and increase how much you're training
the target muscle it can allow that
target muscle to grow whereas normally
it's so much training overall that
barely anything grows so you grow some
of your body by specializing the other
part stays the same you switch the
priorities where you deprioritize what
you've been growing prioritize
everything else and it goes like this
and that's kind of like
two steps forward zero steps back
you grow overall over time
so you can just train everything
normally
but if you want to prioritize the
development there is a process to follow
and often this question comes up is how
many muscles can i prioritize at the
same time
and the answer is however many you can
recover from systemically prioritization
means you're doing more volume more
frequency maybe even more intensity
for any given muscle than you normally
do if you're a beginner you can kind of
put everything on full blast and just
grow everything all the time if you're
an intermediate sort of almost by
definition you may start to be in a
position where you can't train
everything ultra hard and you have to
take some muscles and put them on the
back burner if you're more advanced you
may only be able to specialize two to
four muscles per any given training
block or mesocycle because if you do any
more than that specialize which means
more than normal the systemic fatigue
will get crazy you won't be able to make
gains so how many muscles can you
specialize the answer is well how many
can you recover from so try specializing
a few muscles and you should find that
that you recover just fine
next time you go to specialization add a
few muscles to that so you try to say
this
next three months i'm going to
specialize in my chest and my back it
goes great no recovery problems they're
saying fucking i'm going to add my arms
in next time you add your arms great
still great progress you add your
shoulders and you're like oh this is a
bit much then you know that maybe just
chest back and arms or maybe just you
know hamstrings calves glutes
prioritize just at the same time and
then when you stop prioritizing one of
those you go and prioritize another and
that way sort of piecemeal you make
awesome gains
all right
the basics of specialization here are
sort of the ingredients that make it
what it is and make it effective
first specificity you want to choose and
there's a lot of these are kind of
no-brainers but we have to cover them
just to make sure we get our bases
covered
specificity we have to choose exercises
modalities like maya wraps straight sets
etc and repetition ranges that
preferentially stimulate the target
muscle for example if you notice that
your lower chest really responsible to
higher ups and doesn't respond to weld
or lower reps and you're telling people
hey i'm doing a specialization a
prioritization cycle for my lower chest
and someone catches you doing real low
reps would be like fuck are you doing
that for i thought you said your chest
responded better to higher reps
that's a good point so specialization a
lot of times
we do for muscles that aren't our
strongest they're actually some of our
weakest like if anything you do makes
your side belts grow you don't need
specialization because they're just
always going to grow
but if your lower packs are kind of a
weak part for you and they seem to
struggle for growth you want to make
sure to put everything you can
all of your checks all your boxes have
to be checked give yourself the biggest
advantage as possible which means
choosing the right exercises modalities
and rep ranges that you really feel are
really awesome for you specialization
phases are not the time to explore like
oh i wonder if this will work that's for
other times specialization is when you
put a pedal to the metal and really put
all of your best weapons ahead like you
know for a fact higher ups work you know
for a fact the decline bench and uh dips
really fuck up your lower chest you
include those because specialization
isn't like oh maybe it'll go or not
you're spending a lot of time really
focusing on a muscle you want to make
sure specificity-wise you're targeting
it as well as possible
to that end on the prioritization front
ideally on most of the days in which you
train a prioritized a specialized muscle
you want to train it first or early in
the program the last thing you want to
do is train a muscle when you're already
tired because then systemic fatigue will
prevent you from really training that
muscle hard for example if you say hello
i'm really prioritizing lower chest
here's what my workout looks like i
start with incline barbell press then an
incline demo press doing a flat bench
press and then i do some decline flies
at the end
someone could be like okay
so the decline flies hit your lower
chest like uh-huh
and you do them when you're the most
tired ah
so the stimulus is the lowest it could
be and you're like
ha
touche sir right if you're really
interested in desserts for example going
out to eating just oh my god i can't
wait for the dessert
you want to go to a dessert place first
because when you're hungriest you
probably have the most ability to taste
the food and really enjoy the fuck out
of it i think if you are like super
excited about dessert and you go have a
huge big regular dinner and then dessert
shows up you might be like
i guess i'm having cheesecake yay i want
to throw up right whatever it is you're
prioritizing you probably want to do
early so a lot of your program is going
to change when you're prioritizing lower
chest you're going to start with a lot
of lower chest work and then everything
else you're doing that day will follow
after it doesn't have to be every day
but most of the days of that program
will look like that next up
frequencies should usually be higher
higher frequency training tends to be
really fatiguing and it's not super
sustainable however it has been shown in
repeat literature reviews to be more
hypertrophic it causes more muscle
growth so if you're normally training
your lower chest twice a week
if you really want to boost it up and
over the next several months get it much
bigger try three times a week again not
sustainable it's not something you'll be
able to do for the rest of your training
career because your lower chest will
fall apart however in the short term
while specializing you may want to do
higher frequency because again that's
putting all of the check boxes checked
that's saying i'm going to put
everything i can into this to make sure
it really really grows
lastly
of the muscles that you're not
specializing in let's say upper pecs are
you going to do the same amount of work
for them as usual well no because in
order for your lower pecs to have as
much stimulus as possible you don't want
to be tired from training all the other
muscles super hard and for them to get
as much recovery as possible you don't
want your body trying to recover
everything else from heart training so
what you can do is consider reducing the
overall volume for other muscle groups
like if you're really prioritizing your
lower chest maybe it's not the greatest
time to prioritize your mid chest and
upper chest keep those at sort of
maintenance volume and really push the
lower chest if you're prioritizing let's
say upper body just as an example you
want to like cool it on your legs a
little bit because if you prioritize
everything unless you're a beginner you
won't be able to do due diligence to the
muscle you're actually prioritizing
secondly
especially you want to consider
reducing synergist volume muscles that
help that target muscle
in many of the exercises you want to
make sure you're not taxing the fuck out
of them on their own time so that
they're not the limiting factors when it
comes to the program for example this is
actually perfect for lower chest
what muscles really help you fuck your
lower chest up well the rest of your
chest for sure and also triceps so for
example if you're really trying to cook
your lower chest but you're doing so
much tricep work throughout the week
that every time you do dips for the
lower packs your triceps fail first
your lower packs are like anyway glad we
could help train the triceps again you
want your triceps fresh so that your
lower chest gets as many high quality
reps as possible goes to its own limits
as much as possible so you're going to
back off on tricep training so if you're
really serious about prioritizing your
lower chest
take your tricep training you don't have
to reduce it to zero reduce it a little
bit if you normally do let's say 15 sets
of triceps per week try to take it down
to like 10. i promise you'll have better
lower chest results in that case
all right so that's the idea that's the
theory let's get to constructing your
actual lower chest priority plan
frequency
give a thought this isn't for everyone
to training with a frequency one
time per week higher for that muscle
group for the lower chest than normal so
for example if usually you do like two
sessions of chest training per week try
three if you usually do three try four
just for a few mesocycles not for
forever right
and of course you're going to be
focusing a few of those sessions if you
train three times a week for chest
probably two of those will really be
focused on lower chest and one of them
on the rest of the chest to also give
your lower chest a break to do really
good work the next week
as far as exercises this is kind of a
no-brainer you don't need phd
biomechanics to figure this out you want
a core of flat pressing but with an arch
and retracted shoulders which exposes
your lower chest really really well you
can absolutely do decline pressing as
well
in the real world decline pressing is
kind of a fucking pain in the ass and
here's why
a lot of gems don't have a decline press
which isn't even that bad of a thing
because it's a fucking kind of useless
exercise if you know how to arch or
retract properly
your lower chest is already a huge
stimulus target and usually the limiting
factor
secondly a lot of times even if you have
one of those machines
you can't unrack it by yourself and you
got to get some asshole from the fucking
gym done racket like hey your name's
your name is tom was it tom he's like
it's bill you're like bill you're the
fucking man can you unwrap this shit for
me because bill doesn't know what you're
doing you're getting stapled with 315
and getting your fucking head cut off is
it when does not simply dump a decline
bench like where are you gonna dump it
just face right there you could try to
play lucky and dump back that way who
the fuck knows you get your forehead cut
off it's kind of fucking scary you can
try to do a dumbbell setup with a
decline bench and one of those ab
machine like
the ab declines i've seen people do that
it's just a lot of work for maybe not a
lot of benefit if you're a fan of
decline pressing if there's a machine
like a hammer strength you can do
decline oh perfect but
a lot of flat pressing if you simply
arch your back and retract your shoulder
blades really does hit the lower chest
super well you may not need direct
decline work for pressing however
decline flies both with dumbbells and
with cables are a swell idea and i would
definitely
consider that
and of course you want to keep some
normal overall chest work even some
incline work in but on the easier days
or towards the end of the sessions first
you want to prioritize flat pressing
decline focused archer retracted and of
course some decline flying as well
set numbers
per session you want to start with
something between two and six sets per
session total for the chest and whatever
gets you a decent pump and this kind of
feels like a bit of a workout and then
over the course of the weeks you go up
as needed to continue to get really
really great stimuli
loading and repetition ranges generally
speaking you want to get the rep ranges
to give you the best stimulus to fatigue
ratios tension pump burn
really tire the muscle out without
hurting your joints or making you feel
like total shit
there's huge individual variation and
even exercise variation like for decline
dumbbell presses sets of five to ten
might be amazing for you but for cable
decline flies or just flies like this
anything you know shy of
anything less than 10 reps might just
feel like you're ripping your shoulders
apart but sets of 15 just fry your lower
pecs so it's on you to pick the rep
ranges that just give you the best
stimulus and the lowest amount of
fatigue
in most cases
you want to construct the session such
that the beginning of the session is the
heaviest work and the lightest work is
safe for later because you can always do
light work very effectively after you do
heavy work the same is not true the
other way around so if sets of five to
ten work well for your lower pecs start
with sets of five to ten and then the
next exercise move on to ten to twenty
twenty to thirty whatever checks the
boxes for stimulus to fatigue
in addition to that lastly
if you have a week let's say monday
wednesday friday you train chest and of
course you get two days off saturday
sunday and then you recycle the program
heavy requires lots of rest it requires
a low fatigue state to really benefit
from so what i would say is try to
structure your week such that the early
part of the week is the heavier and the
latter part of the week is the lighter
so if you have exercises that are great
in the five to ten rep range i would do
those on like monday and wednesday i
wouldn't do them on like wednesday and
friday and if you have exercises that
are really good in the higher rep ranges
i would save those mo more for wednesday
and friday i wouldn't do a whole lot of
them on monday at least not first
because heavy is best done early in the
week you get lots of time to recover
until you have to do heavy again that
next week
all right
progressing through your plan okay so
you build a plan and don't worry we'll
have a sample plan for you in a sec set
numbers if you're no longer sore before
the next time it comes to train lower
pecs
then
and if you're strong again and you get
great performance just add one set to
that prior session so for example if you
train lower chest monday and by the
wednesday after your chest doesn't slow
anymore you have a great workout next
week add a set to whatever monday was so
if you did four sets on monday
training on wednesday everything was
great everything was recovered next time
for monday do five cents
it's that easy if you're still sore or
barely recovered don't add any sets so
if you do four sets and you're all
barely recovered or still a little sore
next monday don't do anything more than
four sets you can't just push progress
through progress only occurs in a
balance of stimulus and recovery so if
you're recovering well you can add the
stimulus if you're recovering just on
time don't add anything if you're not
recovering at all don't add anything
your body will use to it over time
how many reps in reserve generally as
with most hypertrophy programs you start
around three reps shy in the tank and
you add load and reps over time and that
number eventually drips to like one
weapon reserve or even zero reps in
reserve and going to all-out failure if
you fail to match performance two
sessions in a row you're getting weaker
it's time to deload easy easy plan
as far as loading and reps i would say
seek to add
two and a half to five pounds on the bar
or in the dumbbells or in the machine
stack per week and or add one to two
reps every time to that exercise per
week to each set and
you can try to target the rir in
relation to that but really if you just
add two and a half to five pounds and or
one to two reps at some point whatever
reps in reserve you started with let's
say it was three it has to float down to
two and to one and then eventually to
failure
the alternative is you get stronger
forever and then you take over
and you're in charge of the earth which
would be sweet but unlikely
so
what does a sample plan look like
finally your free program awaits
i'm not going to belabor and just read
all the shit off the fucking screen
because there it is and you could just
read yourself pause the video shut me
the fuck up look at that and then clue
back in on pause so sample program again
this isn't dogma you don't have to do it
this way but if you're like man all this
shit sounds really great i don't really
know what it would look like in real
life voila here's a good example and you
can actually use this if you'd like
so monday just a sample program we do
flat barbell press for three sets heavy
and then paused weighted dips
with your feet behind you
so if you're hanging there for dips we
want the feet back this way because that
leverages your chest forward and makes
it more of a chest dip
if you put your feet in front of you
then you can stay very upright and it's
more triceps remember this is lower
chest focus so we want to put our feet
behind us you can cross your feet tuck
them together put them behind you and
then lean forward a little bit chest out
go super deep pause at the bottom and
come back up
beautiful chest exercise
especially targeting the lower packs
so three sets of flat barbell press two
sets
of paused weighted dips excellent notice
the dips are at a higher rep range
because we're tired already
wednesday we start with decline cable
flies it's not like a weird setup or
something you don't need the decline
bench you just do cable flies but
instead of flying like this you just fly
like this you fly down
and after three sets of that you go to
flat machine press and again on the flat
machine press you want to arch and
retract to expose more of your lower
pecs oh that was kind of sexual
i'm feeling myself
friday
scott the video guy thought that was
hilarious back there laughing and
probably touching himself but that would
make it just like every other video who
knows what he's doing back there
friday
quirky thing happens low incline
dumbbell press that means we're pressing
not like this in an incline but like
this why well here's the thing first of
all it's just for three sets yeah that's
not very challenging
and it's low incline which like what the
fuck i thought this was a lower chest
program that doesn't even target the
lower chest aha aha jewish revelation
monday and wednesday we're beating the
fuck up out of our lower chest
friday we want an exercise that still
stimulates it a little bit because a
little bit of stimulus promotes recovery
and of course we need to train the other
parts of our chest we don't want our
upper pecs to shrink during this time
but by making friday very easy and by
hitting the other parts of our chest
we're letting our lower chest recover
like crazy over the weekend so when we
come back monday we're ultra fresh to
fucking hammer that lower chest again
because if we constructed a program that
was monday lower chest wednesday lower
chest friday lower fucking chest again
by the time we get to next monday our
lower chest will be like you fuck you
i'm out i can't do this shit anymore
there's never time for me to recover so
a really good strategy is to hit it
really hard early in midweek
later in the week back up a little bit
train the rest of your chest a little
because remember we're backing off from
most of the chest and then when you come
back to next monday you're fresh you're
ready and you build build build back off
build build build week over week over
week you're getting great lower chest
results
now
that first slide
this one right here is week one
here is a sample potentially of what
your final week pre-deload would look
like maybe you're running a six-week
progression which means week five would
be this last week before a deload
and here's what it could look like folks
do not do this verbatim again we
increase sets in an auto regulatory
fashion if we're recovering and things
are good we add a set if we're
recovering just on time and there's no
room to add anything we don't add
anything and if we're really really
really not recovering we actually take a
set away to make sure we start
recovering again but a lot of people
will add some sets because your body
gets used to shit as you do it more and
and over time you could do more sets
week to week to week not every week
potentially but as your body indicates
that you recovered so you could end up
in the last week with something
like seven sets of barbell press notice
in the first week it was three reps in
reserve that we were doing and now with
zero reps and reserves so basically
taking shit to failure for seven cents
holy fucking shit your lower chest is
fried five sets of dips on wednesday six
sets of decline cable flies four sets of
machine presses low incline dumbbell
press on friday only four sets now we
could be recovered to do way more than
that we started with three and all we
ended with was four that's on purpose
you don't want to increase that friday
sets even if you can because you're
purposefully just having a mini workout
to allow that recovery to occur because
monday you have to get into it again if
we just did like eight sets of dumbbell
presses what the fuck are we gonna do
next monday now the clever of you will
observe that oh no not a sec
next monday after this week is a deload
so fuck it so absolutely
on this monday or so this friday the
last one you can cook yourself it
doesn't fucking matter you can do eight
sets who cares because you'll deload be
fine but all the other weeks it's gonna
be like three sets three sets three sets
four sets four sets deload
or three sets three sets threes has four
sets eight sets deload that's totally
fine but basically the real kicker is
friday you want to be much easier
through the entire routine until maybe
last friday and then you fucking torture
chest take fucking lighters and
i guess that's the nipples are there you
might not want to do that the nipples
tend to hurt if you irritate them
all right
lastly
how long do you do this for just
specialize forever well hold on a sec
there's too little specialization and
too much if you specialize for longer
than like a few months
because remember none of this is
sustainable frequency is higher the
volume is higher
specificity is super direct you can over
train muscles and then they actually
start regressing in size and potentially
getting hurt you don't want any of that
so you want to cap it at around three
mesocycles you know five weeks of hard
training one week of deload and you
repeat that three times two or three
times is an excellent amount of time to
specialize
can you specialize for just one
mesocycle you sure can but i sort of
humbly recommend that you do it for two
or three because one muscle cycle of
gains is sweet but if you can continue
to progress milk everything you can out
of it maybe it's a good idea to do two
or three to really see a visible change
one message cycle of lower chest
prioritization you could look at your
physique and be like
all right it's a little bit bigger but
if you do two or three you'll be like
wow holy crap my lower chest really
improved
you go to the club and that one girl
that never fucking talks to you she's
like hey what's your name you're like
bill
she's like i noticed your lower chest
you're like oh oh god you got super
fucking red face and she's like whatever
loser and she walks off you're like fuck
fuck fuck
i got my lower chest big but i still
can't talk to girls if you want to learn
how to talk to girls don't fucking ask
me i have no idea how it works after
binding club my name is not bill and i
sure as hell have never had a girl
initiate a conversation with me
if you're going method of messing a mess
in a priority phase you can't just train
the same each time you can do the same
exercises however
in many cases you want to actually do
more high rep training as you go
because
as you accumulate fatigue over the mesos
not all falls off grinding sets of 5 to
ten might be easy in the first two
mesocycles but in the last one your
joints might be a little er so you might
want to do some higher rep training so
maybe mostly sets of five to ten in the
first mezzo
more sets of 10 to 20 in the second
mesocycle and even a few sets of 20 to
30 in the last meso to really finish off
on a high note without risking joint
injuries so on and so forth not
mandatory but something cool to think
about
you may want to use some new exercises
each time ideally though you delete and
replace exercises only when the stimulus
to fatigue ratio falls off so for
example if you're doing decline barbell
press and it's fucking amazing the
stimulus is insane your joints feel
incredible
don't fucking get rid of it and you can
ask like what so you want me to decline
press three mesocycles in a row yeah if
it's working well fuck yeah it's like
same idea of like
what should you order a restaurant when
you go to a restaurant like if you have
a regular food that you really love like
let's say the meatball pasta is like oh
perfect if you show up to the restaurant
there's only one question to ask do you
really want the meatball pasta
search your heart of hearts and be like
yes then you fucking order the meatball
boss the only time you don't order is if
you ask yourself do i really want it
and you look at the menu like oh this
other thing looks good then you order
same with exercises if let's say you're
doing machine presses and after two
message cycles you're like i don't know
man that last week fucking blue i'm
tired of these things my fucking
shoulders kind of feel weird on it i'm
not getting big pumps i'm gonna switch
to decline dumbbell presses you make the
switch and it's great get rid of the
machines intro the dumbbells perfect so
ideally while you could sort of
proactively introduce new exercises
the best recommendation is if the
stimulus to fatigue ratio is good you
keep it in
if it starts sliding down on you and you
think oh there's another exercise i'd
like to try which i think will have a
better stimulus to feed ratio than you
replace it on the next message cycle
frequency
generally
you start with lower frequencies and
move up and then you sort of deload and
get away from that specialization so
let's say you want to specialize your
training chest usually twice a week you
go three times a week first message
cycle second mesocycle you still have a
third one left so you're not gonna sort
of cook all your eggs yet you're gonna
go three again in that third mesocycle
try four times a week worst case
scenario you fry your shit out but good
news you don't have to be sustainable
because after you get a break here's
that last part
after ideally you want either a low
volume phase or an active rest phase to
really relax and heal all that stuff
because specialization phases take it
out of you
do you have to take one of these no
but what i would say is for that next
phase after three mesocycles of really
cooking your lower chest
i would say that next meso be an active
rest be at low volume or be in a normal
hypertrophy mental cycle for your lower
chest it should be active rest or low
volume it should be much much less don't
just go back to normal lower chest
training it's going to need a break
because it's been pushed to its limits
and a little bit beyond it's time to
back off for a few weeks heal all the
joints connective tissues the muscles so
that when you want to grow it again it's
healthy it's robust it responds and it's
not going to just break in half
after that
your lower chest has taken a break
you're maybe ready to go again you can
either specialize it again
go back to normal training where you
train everything all the same or
specialize a muscle group that is
completely unrelated that's all up to
you whatever you want to do so can you
specialize muscles back to back to back
a block which is like three mesocycles
in a row can you do back-to-back blocks
no because you should do an active rest
or low volume at least for that muscle
after you do that two to four weeks of
lighter training for that muscle and
much easier training can you do another
specialization block for that muscle
absolutely if your heart desires
all right that's a whole lot of shit
maybe you need some help with a bit more
resources don't worry we've got you
covered
if you're wondering about how some of
these exercises look we have an exercise
video library link right in the
description it's completely free you
click and it's me narrating and jared
feather doing the exercises teaches you
how to do the techniques really well we
even have a muscle group training guide
so the guide for pecs is right below and
actually we're going to link the whole
thing so you have all the muscle guides
click on chest a lot of the lower chest
exercises in there and it really tells
you how to construct a chest program
reps and sets and exercise techniques
and frequencies and all that stuff is
covered it's super awesome it's
completely free by the way
we have also linked the hypertrophy made
simple videos so if you're watching this
you're like sfr what the fuck is that
covered super simply it's actually a
radically simple concept in the
hypertrophy made simple videos which are
also in there
if you're tired of free shit you want to
