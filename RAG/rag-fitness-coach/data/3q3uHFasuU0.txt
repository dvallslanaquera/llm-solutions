we are back folks welcome back weekly
webinar dr mike dr james dr mike's
looking very sith lordy today hope you
guys appreciate him mike how's it going
i'll just answer with the only relevant
thing to say
uh dark side
it seems that it takes him so much
emotional energy to say
the dark sides like to say that phrase
that like you know
fucker like if i was anakin and shit and
this motherfucker was recruiting me
he'd be like giant ass i'd be like you
don't look so good dude
like i don't know if you know obi-wan
yeah he's annoying
his skin looks clear his eyes are open
it just see it's like it's like the
bodybuilder tries to talk him to doing
like five grams of trend
like i don't i don't think i want
anybody you don't want like you haven't
lived too much longer
so maybe not the dark side is all i'm
trying to say
yeah and he's he's like he's in every
fucking movie and he just lives for
eternity like get out of here i'm sick
of your ass palpatine
lives and he's barely alive he's like
right like you've been the same actor
for like
forever you know you couldn't even get a
new actor he's been old this whole time
he literally has been old for two
generations straight
god how fuck is that possible it is kind
of sweet but
also it's like jack lalanne was old in
like the 1920s
he outlived all of us dumbasses yeah for
sure
all right well instead of fuckery why
don't we get on with the show here
that's oh gorilla bow light and original
oh gorilla bow travel i like the travel
one is actually really big
yeah but what what am i going to am
going to take that with me somewhere
like i feel like the light wins the
travel one too but who knows what travel
means
i feel like that's something like if you
put like an australian would give you
endless shit about like yeah nah man
what's that gorilla bow all about
you going to shoot something with it
yeah yeah
everyone in america's got like a bow
don't they
like no everyone in australia is not
crocodile dundee goddammit
all right you ready james i'm ready
travis s
excuse me got it all right
for physique athletes is there any
practical substance to exercises for
quote unquote lower or corner
upper abs my understanding of the
literature is that all the exercises
stimulate the rectus abdominis equally
if from personal experience certain
exercises take all the adequate stimulus
boxes for separate parts of the abs
for example flutter kicks will supply
tension burner disruption and soreness
to my lower abs
but tabletop crunches will do it in the
upper abs uh despite
research says could you over time select
as actually do bias
certain parts of the rectus abdominis
this is completely irrelevant i'm just a
pussy who needs to train harder that may
be true no matter what we conclude here
about the abs
um no uh preferential activation of
various parts of muscles has been well
illustrated for 10 years now
just look up brad schoenfeld's summary
of that research uh
it's absolutely possible to train uh or
activate
some parts of the muscle and more than
others as
it has been demonstrated actually not
just activate but grows called regional
hypertrophy let's look it up
so if you really do feel tension burn
pump disruption etcetera
in your lower abs or more than upper and
with an exercise it's the good money
says
that it's being activated more it's
absolutely a thing um so yeah like while
the best ab exercises are the ones that
just overall stimulate the most like
for example the ab wheel roll out i mean
this just like fuck you up
but if you have exercise the target
lower abs totally just take one quick
thing
don't expect lower ab hypertrophy
to cause a lower ab cool look unless
you're planning on having bigger abs and
or are very lean
probably both so it doesn't remember
spot reduction is still not a thing
so yeah and just keep in mind although
regional hypertrophy
can and does happen it's also an easy
excuse for fuckery what i've found
is that people will be like oh i'm going
to try like arnold did a lot of fuckery
in his uh
book about like oh train the biceps this
part of the biceps for the yeah
it's like yeah some of you don't know
any of that right but um
but like a lot of it is just like okay
if you pick an exercise you're gonna if
it if it's
if it hits a large portion of the muscle
it's gonna you know hit a lot of all the
muscle but it might
target some parts of it regionally but i
find that like um a lot of people will
use
that idea as an excuse to do dumb shit
and be like but i feel it here looks
like it's so dumb
like come on yeah i can hit myself with
a hammer and it will i'll feel it you
know right sure
don't ever trade off gnarly full-on raw
stimulus magnitude or sfr
like people are like mike do you ever do
like the fucking what do you do for your
vastus lateralis i'm like
not shit man i do deep knee bends deep
squats leg press attack squats my quads
grow
all over and there's if i did some weird
shit with my feet turned out when i feel
it a little bit more in one part sure
but i feel it's so much less than the
others it's kind of like
you know like if you're real if you're
really hungry for a big meal
and someone's like here's this really
gingery flavored cookie but it's half a
cookie you're like
i can appreciate some ginger get that
out of a fucking face
give me a real meal of just captain
crunch
i know it's not gingery but i can eat a
whole box you know like
at some point if you're hungry you're
saying you need a lot
i don't know if i paid off too much
quantity for corn core quality i feel
like there's going to be a lot of those
type of analogies going on today
help look at my face captain crunch
somebody's thinking about captain crunch
jared feather right now he's at
nationals i'll be joining him in a day
actually to just bomb around and watch
him turn pro or whatever hopefully
he says he's so lean and dry that he's
had trouble smiling because it hurts his
cheeks as his skin rubs against his
cheek so i was like
huh i was doing cardio earlier today and
i almost did cardio to failure
i like walked really fast from the gym
and then i was walking back
and i was like i'm having trouble
walking i don't am i gonna have to like
sit down and
call an uber it was like really intense
i was like all right at least i know i'm
pushing it
walking to failure is definitely a life
milestone it's a very good
accomplishment
um i saw jared's uh chest picture on
instagram the other day i was like god
damn hell going on in here yeah
all right next up
john m very vanilla named john m
very m is a really really good question
how confident are you that metabolic
training like the metabolite measure and
the mpt template
uh contributes significantly to muscle
gain compared to just running
hypertrophy muscle again
i figured that the expected value of
gains from metabolite meso
minus gains from hypertrophy measurement
under current posterior belief is very
large
it might make sense to skip it for a
trainee
who isn't a big fan of that type of
training i ask since i'm an impression
that tablet stuff is more of a we have
reasons to believe that this might
contribute
it probably doesn't hurt so why not do
it then it definitely helps you
and there's no real consensus atheist
as i believe stands for as far as i know
um
yeah i think you're mostly right on i
will say that the metabolite
you know the whole meso is you don't
have to do a whole mess of it you can
sprinkle it in whatever you want
but a mesocycle of more metabolite work
and less other stuff
and thus consequently lighter work has
some advantages that i think are worth a
mention
so you said like some you're someone
someone's not a big fan of that type of
training
thing is your joints are going to be big
fans of that kind of training
and then the release of monotony from
conventional training
is going to be a big fan of that kind of
training so it's like saying
do i have to do active rest i'm not a
big fan of it i just want to keep
training like yeah you can keep training
if you feel fine and just deload
but activerest has these underlying
benefits that don't express themselves
in the act of doing it
it's a compounding thing that occurs
later so
do you have to do metabolite training no
can you just do conventional rep ranges
absolutely
that is a metabolite meso every now and
again going to give you definitely
robust hypertrophy yes
is it going to destress your joints yes
um
is it going to be a variation that even
though that you might not like it
it really primes you and pumps you
psychologically for regular hardcore
training for months after
totally and because it's two things
effective and
primes you for later training to be more
effective psychologically by just by not
being monogamous
it's like a win-win so maybe you don't
have to do a metabolic phase every
block but every other block or something
throw it in maybe for three or four
weeks
it could be a really good change of pace
that checks every single box and as a
net benefit because it spares your
joints
and and really like um trumps you up
it's kind of like
here's another food analogy james uh
it's like you know if you
are always going out to eat at your
favorite restaurants every weekend
skipping a weekend or two and just
eating at home
it's not as fun but it can really make
you appreciate the fuck out of some
tasty restaurant food later
just make things better overall because
you guys ever been in a situation
where you're going out to eat so much
that someone's like what do you want
cheat meal tonight you're like nothing i
don't
give a shit anymore i've had all the
pizza in the ice cream it's just not
doing
you know what it's supposed to but if
you have some meals at home and it's not
so fun
it still checks all the boxes of getting
you fed and making sure you're
alive and nutrition coming in but then
it like you know a couple weekends later
you're like oh that new thai place is
supposed to be like i'm over the whole
thing so something like that yeah
absolutely and i think one last thing it
fits very nice the metabolite phase fits
very nicely into like a phase
potentiated model for hypertrophy
training
where you might uh start to experience
some stainless from doing kind of the
the meat and potatoes training and it
gives that a little bit of variation
stimulus
and when you're going on through if
you're assuming you're doing some kind
of paired dieting whether it's massing
or
cutting typically as you get further and
further along you start to have more
fatigue relating effects which can
inhibit your ability to lift heavy in
some different ways so
especially on a cut diet it's more
profound so it just kind of fits in and
checks a lot of boxes in a face
potentiated model
in a longitudinal model for hypertrophy
training acutely like you
like you said you could probably do
either one and it's not a huge deal
but when you're actually looking at
training in sequences over the course of
meso de mezzos or blocks to blocks
having that in there does seem to check
a lot of boxes do you have to do it no
is it probably a good idea
yeah yeah yeah very well said
at some point you get to a place where
like i can do another meso
but it can't be conventional heavy
training and then you're like oh
metabolite exists
versus just being like oh it's time for
active rest it's like yeah
but it's not and like and the thing is
like most of us
have been there where you get to a point
where especially if you're dieting
you're like i just can't do sets of
eight anymore like it's just it's
killing me it's literally i have four
weeks left of dieting and i can't just
do active rest
i can do a set of 15 and then maybe like
a metabolite cable curl like i can do
that
and you can probably reap some benefit
from it yeah
next up inti castro
what i
speak american over here boy what you
talking about fuck i swear to god
i n t i space
got it there it is great question james
i want you to
tee off on this after i say my two cents
fatigue and cognitive function how much
would the accumulated fatigue over meso
affect
school performance performance may be
none capability of maximum performance
significant creativity flexibility of
thought
novel ideas and rapid computation that
has to be more accurate than not
significant i deal with this all the
time because my main job is to be
intellectually productive
but then like week four from ezzo i like
spared the computer and i'm like
what the fuck are ideas when i drop my
fatigue and i'm like i wake up in the
middle of the night write shit down i'm
like oh my fucking god i i know
everything
so it's definitely significant uh james
do you have any uh experience and inside
this
i do because of some of the research i
was doing recently on the
volume landmarks for skills and tactics
stuff a lot of it dips into the
learning area and so i had to learn a
lot about learning which is kind of
funny to say
um but it turns out that things like
memory consolidation
and recall are heavily influenced by
fatigue states so you actually do have
a i this is i i got to think of a better
way to state this
in that because you can't do it in
sports science terms it's the wrong
field right but you could you could
phrase it in
the sense of like you have to have a
state of preparedness
mentally to be able to learn consolidate
refine
thoughts and ideas right and if you're
too fatigued you're going to have a
really hard time doing that
and one thing that is kind of
interesting and it's related to learning
and fatigue
is that in many cases if you're trying
to learn something new
and you miss out on your sleep
opportunity maybe you just didn't get
enough sleep or you had a rough night
just didn't sleep the way you wanted to
it's actually in many cases kind of an
all or nothing effect where
you had an opportunity to consolidate
some of the information that was going
on throughout the day
you missed your sleep opportunity and
that's one of the big regulators of
things like memory consolidation
and if you miss it you just kind of have
to start over and try again so literally
like whatever information that you took
in that day
it's not to say it's like you didn't get
any of it but you did not get a
significant portion of it that you
probably would have otherwise have
gotten
and so we see a lot of really
interesting fatigue interactions with
things like your ability to recall
things and some of the things that mike
already mentioned but
even just learning and refining the the
knowledge that you have
heavily influenced and so there's
definitely a case to be made that you
have to have a state of preparedness
i hate that word phrasing but it's it's
the idea is there
to be able to learn effectively so yeah
absolutely is going to interfere at some
point
yep uh
henrik anderson
anderson mr anderson
and i noticed that my lips don't move
nearly as much as they should when i
got him all right he's got three
questions
we usually just say we're gonna answer
one but we'll see
number one
hmm henrik we're going to go to two and
three
so no mike mike didn't like that one
i'll tell you
well here's why uh in within the next
three weeks
based on our content release schedule
and this video was recorded like three
months ago
we have a fucking comprehensive
pre-exhaust video coming out in rp
like it's just gonna answer every
fucking question you have on it so i'm
gonna
punch to that sorry but it's coming and
it's gonna be amazing and
if we take time to answer this it's
going to be like
there's just lots of nuance to answer it
well because there's times when
pre-exhaust actually bad idea
times when it's fine and times when it's
great so i'll punt
on that but let's get to number two here
uh when cutting down for the summer and
staying lean for two to three months you
know to get the ladies
ladies you can tell yourself that's what
you're interested in
um is there anything i should know or do
with training nutrition
when trying to build as much muscle mass
while staying lean
training volumes and so james you're
pissed i'll give you the floor
yeah so henrik so you kind of have don't
do it just cue
conflicting ideas right so cutting down
for the stoma and staying lean
is one thing right and then trying to
build as much muscle mass while staying
lean
is a completely different thing right so
i'm not sure if you're if you're kind of
using those two things in the same idea
or for if we're
excluding them they should be excluded
right so the first one is really simple
right you cut down for the summer
you're gonna take a modest calorie
deficit for two to three months say like
somewhere between 0.5
maybe one percent body weight per week
somewhere in the middle there uh
do your normal training stuff train hard
mev to mrv type training no big deal
um when trying to build as much muscle
while staying lean it's largely the same
song and dance kind of in the opposite
direction however
i kind of feel mike you can you chime in
here and let me know if i'm on point
more often than not when people ask this
question they are really asking like how
do i gain muscle without gaining fat
that's the reason efficiently yeah and
that's the idea is inefficiently so it's
kind of like
if you take a moderate weight gain rate
say let's say about 0.5 percent body
weight per week
you will stay relatively lean as you
gain muscle mass are you leaving maybe a
teeny tiny bit of gains on the table
from not gaining more weight maybe
sure okay but you're also not
accumulating as much fat which allows
you to mask for a longer period of time
and in the long term end up gaining more
muscle uh longitudinally rather than
just the acute short-term picture so if
you insist on gaining
through that time it's as opposed to
just maintaining
if that's fine james gave the first part
of a very good answer
which is just gain on the low end i
would say 0.25
percent per week so that means if you
weigh 200 pounds only shoot for like
half a pound per week of game of game
which means like 12 weeks later you only
weigh six more pounds
you're not the world's fattest man at
the end of that right so first get lean
then through the 12 weeks of summer
literally only gain like five to seven
pounds
and then you'll be fucking pretty lean
the whole time literally
um is it costing you potential muscle
gains maybe
yeah but the second part
is how do you go about actually doing
that so here's one fact that will occur
when you're busy trying to get the
ladies you're going to be doing ice
cream and barbecues and fun things
which means weekends and sometimes even
weekdays there's going to be some eating
which does not comport with that 0.25
so my best advice to you is when you
are not having fun and cheating because
look don't not cheat
the summer especially when you're young
trying to get laid
i mean like fucking love of god just eat
some bullshit
have fun your youth only happens once um
that being said on the days in which
you're not
going out and eating don't jam the food
take like a small deficit
or just maintenance eat higher protein
lower carb lower fat
high volume high low density food tons
of
really good stuff veggies greens shit
like that fruits and then when it's
going to end up happening is most of
your gain
will come from the cheat stuff as far as
surplus weekly
so that you can cheat and still not get
super fat
the way to get fat is to have mostly
every day be a small surplus
and then cheat on top of that on the
weekends say goodbye to that six pounds
that turns into 18 pounds of some shit
and then you get super fat so just
really watch yourself when you're not
partying and then when you're partying
have fun that's probably my best advice
yeah staying active always helps too
yeah
all right number two i think is good
enough for heinrich yeah get out of here
folks one question at a time you should
for sure want them answered
um patrick nori
patrick got it question for jeans oh
oh my during the connective tissue
question from last week
you mentioned about how ever since you
moved you are effectively doing almost
strong man style uh activities on a
daily basis
from when you moved up until now has
that impacted your overall fitness
muscular cardio recovery state
where have you seen improvements in
detriments and how to usually adjust and
adapt
to that uh around your training sessions
to still get the most out of what your
goals are
uh yeah so like i haven't necessarily
figured it out yet i'm still kind of a
work in progress so the one issue that
i've definitely been dealing with
is my um my right forearm extensor
muscle strangely enough i don't know if
it's like a resistance
been jacking off too much dude i don't
know if it's like an inhibition thing or
if it's like
what but there's something about the
shit that i'm doing whether it's the
carrying the logs chopping stuff
gardening caulking some of these checks
in the logs like
my fucking forearm kills me to the point
now where it's starting to radiate down
to wrist pain so i had to change some of
my exercises out which um
were were exacerbating it and that
seemed to help a little bit
it's still kind of bugging me um i
haven't done as much cardio because i
end up just
my knee is so high uh yeah wow that's
great
if now the thing is like i have noticed
that like when i have gone hiking and
stuff
um i have noticed that my cardio has
gone down a little bit
but that's because i was doing so much
cardio training before
and this is what we've got i would mike
and i have talked about this on a couple
webinars where
people say like how much cardio do i
need to be healthy or versus how much do
i need for cardio training like
i get plenty of cardio from my need
activities to be healthy
but because i'm not training for cardio
specifically anymore i've actually
experienced a pretty significant drop
in my cardio when i do activities like
hiking and so that's something i want to
kind of
remedy a little bit because i do i do
enjoy those things and i i want to make
sure
it's not totally painful it's another
thing too is we're at a little higher
altitude out here i think we're
like 3 500 wow that's really high up
yeah it's not not crazy it's not like
you know if you're in like
colorado or something that's definitely
higher but for me i'm very sensitive to
the altitude so like i can
i start feeling that wear and tear
pretty quickly um so one of the things
you just got to think about is kind of
the systemic fatigue factor of whatever
it is that you're doing so
if you're not used to chopping logs
stacking them carrying them and doing
all that shit
it's not the hardest thing in the world
but it is tiring right because it's
heavy and it's just it's basically like
doing
you know farmers walks and you know tire
smashes and all that same shit you see
in my crossfit and strong man gym so
it's exhausting
you uh very likely will have to adjust
some of the training on
things like your arm training shoulder
training uh maybe even
you have to for me i've had to choose
less systemically exhausting exercises
for my legs in particular
that's a big one man yeah so like i do
i'll do like a close dance paw squats is
kind of one of my staples now
i've actually been doing a lot of sissy
squats as like my second quad movement
in the week
and i have shitty quads so that's
actually a good movement for me if
somebody like mike
is too strong for that kind of movement
without really having to weigh like a
200 pound vest or something but for me i
have such long legs and i'm not very
strong in the quads it's actually okay
um so yeah there's just a lot of weird
little little changes um
it's one of those things where it's like
a clearly a trade-off but it's a
trade-off for the lifestyle that i like
to live so
it's it's worth it to me could i be like
more jacked and by not doing that shit
absolutely
but i don't really care why would you be
more jacked if you're choosing not to
live like a lumberjack the entire point
of being jacked is so you can look like
a lumberjack
be alone exactly that was my long-term
long-term periodization right i've done
all that work so i could be a lumberjack
now and live that life
patrick or radowick
another patrick yeah this is like in
search box games
this is like fucking ira convention
oh no patrick o'shaughnessy
this is ireland i
if i could be if i was like immortal
essentially like vegeta like unharmed by
human weapons
one of the many places i would go is
like an ira meetup
because i just want to hear people with
thick irish accents talk about like
liberty from the british empire and just
like yes yes say that shit
and i know that's mostly a scottish
accent you know what i'm saying
but that's further my point i need more
practice with the irish accent how fuck
am i supposed to do that if i'm not
going a secret
dublin meetings i would show up to the
ira meeting like
is this where you get the s p index
funds or is this something else oh it's
a different ira
fuck shit fucking idiot
they'd suspect that you were a spy and
you're like no honestly guys i'm just
here for the accents
this is amazing they shoot you nothing
happens they're like what the fuck
like again i'm not here to make trouble
i could kill all of you i'm immortal i
just want to just keep going with the
meeting
i promise i'm not going to tell i just
love it just do you
pretend i'm not here ignore me um
irish is a tough one to imitate and my
family's irish i have people
my family lives in ireland and even for
me it's hard to quite get it right
whereas like other ones like scottish is
easy for me it's easier to like
make jokes with irish i can't quite get
it the british isles fascinate me
the commonwealth in general uh the
british commonwealth like new zealand
australia
canada uh the uk i
i i would have to say is my favorite
place on earth
it covers a lot of areas it does an
amazing accent except for the canadian
accent which really isn't an accent at
all
they just happen to make up for it by
being model human beings
but almost like too good it's like shut
up you canadian asshole
you think you're better than me accurate
you accurately think you're better than
me
and you're but you're not judging me
which i would at least if you were
judging me
i could hate you like the french are
better than a lot of people but they
know it
you know but the french canadians are
like oh it's okay and you're like no
it's not okay don't be so good
god damn it yeah canada is not too far
from where i live
that's great we're up there what the
fuck is patrick saying oh yeah patrick
rodowick great question question about
scientific methods does telling
subjective
that something is a placebo effect make
that effect smaller in subsequent
measurements in other words
does an awareness of the methods
placebos make it less effective for
example if i have teammates
i think a given recovery method is
awesome and i suspect it is basically an
unfactor
should i bother to disabuse them of
their belief in the method oh two
different questions but two different
questions
uh james will take the second i'll take
the first absolutely
telling subjects the placebo effect as a
placebo
gets rid of probably the entire or most
of the placebo effect
you got to be some weird
to quote riddick what kind of desperate
dick takes a job
like like if someone's like this doesn't
work okay you're like
great it'll help okay so no the placebo
effect is almost entirely washed away if
you tell people it's a placebo
so that's why placebo-controlled studies
uh
like technically but would ethically lie
to people
like they have to in other words you
have to believe that either you don't
know which one the placebo is
or you think both things work or one of
them doesn't really work
so absolutely yes they answer your first
question james
should he disabuse his fellow teammates
of their beliefs i actually want to go
back to the first question because there
are
many documented instances and what mike
said on the whole is very true but there
are instances where you tell someone
that
the ex what they're experiencing is a
placebo effect and it goes on and keeps
working now that's like a
non-statistical portion of most of these
groups
but it does happen which is really funny
those are the best predicts i was
talking about
yeah and that's when i think people when
you you're kind of looking at it more
ideologically than objectively we're
just
like i believe in my heart i want this
to work god damn it
exactly um so for the second question uh
there's there's kind of um
two different trains of thoughts here so
you can sit in like the ivory science
tower and look down on people for doing
things that you know
don't work are stupid and you can tell
them so much
and unfortunately what that does is what
i have found
more harm than good in many cases so you
might liberate them from doing dumb shit
with their free time
but you also might irreparably harm your
relationship with that athlete so
typically in these instances you kind of
evaluate what it is that they're doing
and seeing like what is the cost
effectiveness or what is like the
potential harm that they're doing by
doing it uh and if you find that the
harm is relatively high or that like the
opportunity cost is relatively high
then it's worth having a sit down and
just saying like hey look i know you
really enjoy this but this is really
becoming um a problem in that it's
interfering with things that you could
be doing that could be helping you a lot
or they're spending a lot of money on it
and they're
not that rich um on the other hand if
it's something somewhat innocuous or not
you know
not really taking up much time effort
resources
sometimes it's good just to let them
just keep doing it and then if they want
to come around and ask you about it at a
later time then that's fine then you can
have
a truthful conversation but what i think
most people just need to be aware of
is that if you go around telling people
that what they're doing
something that they believe is working
for them and they honestly in their
heart think that it's making them better
and you go around and say well i know
that that's dumb you should stop doing
it
more likely you're just going to ruin
that relationship with that athlete or
with your trainer or whoever that is
whereas if you just say like hey
you know i think maybe there's some
other things that we can do or if you
just give them some information and say
look
you know i really don't think this is
the best thing but if you really like it
just keep doing it it's fine if you ever
want to talk to me about it again that's
fine
for me if it's like i said if it's
something if i think it's done like
let's just say here's classic example
person gets a one hour massage once per
week
what is the like cost opportunity cost
fatigue cost all the costs of getting a
massage minimal
right like they spent what like 60 bucks
it's an hour once a week
and if anything it actually promotes the
activities that i would otherwise be
recommending that they do right like
relaxing
stepping away from their cell phone you
know having a therapist to some degree
um those are all positive things so if
it's something like that
i would just say like just keep doing it
and if you ever want to ask me about
massage that's great we can talk about
it
if it's something like they're doing two
hours of pool sessions uh every other
day
four times a week yeah that's when it's
like okay this is actually eating up a
significant amount of training and or
recovery time and it's just not spending
50
a week on like some kind of herbs or
some shit you're just yeah
so the kind of the tldr version is like
weigh the pros and cons of whatever it
is that they're doing if it's a huge con
and it's worth bringing up
bring it up to them and let them know
that it's maybe not worth their time and
there are other things that they could
do
if it's relatively low just let them
keep doing it if they want to
ask you about it later that's fine
[Music]
next up the man with a mythical youtube
name mike
oh the mike i suppose he was like
fifth the fifth user to sign up for
youtube
all right in the boxing slash mma world
it is common to hear that you can't
develop on pachanaka power
as it's something you were born with how
true is that doesn't get any stronger
increased power
so let me tell you a couple quick things
before james annihilates this further
the boxing in mma world is filled with
some of the stupidest fucking people
you'll
never have the displeasure of meeting
thank god
don't meet them because they're dumber
in real life than they are on tv and
they're pretty dumb on tv
um a lot of times what passes as wisdom
is just a collection of
retarded things perpetuated by
sequentially retarded people to one
another
so i wouldn't take too much stock into
that so just huge grain of salt
but there is a grain of truth there
where someone's
end limb velocity generation which
depends on a couple of factors
for a few neural ones uh
fiber type and a lot of it is actually
limb length and limb ratio
and limb velocity uh the higher it is
that you can generate the more naka
power you have in addition to that
the actual physical weight of especially
the end
of your uh your limb the physical weight
and size of your fist
plus the velocity which you throw it is
a big factor
and there's also another big big part of
knockout power
which is the degree to which your fist
does not slow down
when it hits somebody in the face the
less it slows down
the more force transfer occurs the more
likely knockout is
because you know tiny tiny weak people
can really put some nasty emblem
velocity on it
but the actual impulse they transmit the
amount of force times time they transmit
into the jaw is really small
as soon as they hit something it goes
like that right which is why like if you
see a 110 pound boxer with unreal hand
speed
you can probably just reach out your
face to it and hit you a couple times
and just do that and then
crush him or whatever so
that being said those are all very
heavily genetically influenced things
however the degree to which you slow
down upon contact
heavily depends on muscular size and
strength which is incredibly alterable
your emblem velocity is not nearly as
alterable but still alterable
uh because of those two things that
multiply to each other especially the
fact that your fist slows down a lot
less if you're really strong
if you become much stronger and if you
gain body weight and put more of your
body
into a punch and you're not much heavier
your ability to alter your knockout
power is huge
and here is the case in point of why
that's true
name me a single heavyweight without
knockout power
they don't exist because they're all
fucking giant and strong
it's not that heavyweights just happen
to have these magic genetics
for knockout power whereas almost 90
percent of all tiny lightweights don't
you know i have no not a doubt in my
mind that if mighty mouse
was scaled up to a heavyweight he would
not ever be motherfuck out
left and right it's not that he doesn't
have knockout genetics he fucking weighs
120 pounds
that's a fixable problem right so if you
like nate diaz
and you're like six two or whatever and
you're 170 if he gained to 230
by training with weights he'd be
knocking motherfuckers out like crazy
but whereas now he that you know yeah
you know most people can take a couple
nate diaz hits to the face and not
really bad and i not most people most
elite fighters with really good chins
but so it is absolutely alterable but
but it is definitely hugely genetic as
well
so yeah you can develop one one punch
knockout power
maybe not develop it but highly highly
increase it
but that's not to say that if especially
if you're constrained to a weight class
if you're in the 120 pound weight class
and you really just have no knockout
power
there's a limited amount of things we
can do with you keeping you in that
weight class that'll make you
there's nothing we can do is going to
make you a knockout artist for sure we
can enhance your punching power
significantly
but a lot of that comes with increasing
strength and increase in mass
so if you go up to 150 oh yeah we can
make a big difference but a lot of times
within the weight class there's only so
much you can do
james yeah that was really good this is
uh where
my sports science degree has made me
some money on a lot of my betting odds
because that's something that's
statistically fucking is that ethical of
course right so
what are the same things that you said
like uh what is the probability of like
a women's
straw weight competitor getting a
knockout in the first bets on that shit
like
yeah knockout like what are you nuts or
even a finish right so like
these are things you can actually you
know look at and see statistically and
look at
populations like you can ufc fightstats
is like a thing you can just go look up
and download and just
play around with the data i've done it a
ton of times and it's how i make a lot
of my bets because you can just look at
some of these things
um but yeah so mike answered it really
well i think he spoke mostly on the
fitness side of things right like can
you get stronger
can you train to be more explosive like
sure a lot of that is
kind of your genetic gift your gift from
your parents or from mother nature but
it is trainable to some degree
i think another thing with the knockout
power and just punching in general
for kickboxing mma those types of sports
there's a huge skill and tactical
component in there as well right
so not only is your you know just
intrinsic physical ability to
wing that arm out there important in
terms of like connecting with somebody
but where you actually are able to place
the shot makes a huge difference right
so you can punch somebody in the nose
all day long and they're not going to
get knocked out right but you hit that
sweet spot right on the chin
and being man did you see the contender
series this week
uh i didn't unfortunately there was a
fucking sick
knockout and it was just the guy threw
one he basically just like feigned left
a little bit
the guy bit on the faint and just went
straight down boom
first punching through knock the guy
just out fucking well that's like the
two ways to get to knockout power
they're not mutually exclusive but the
two illustrations
is francis and ghana versus conor
mcgregor like
god is not known to be a technical guy
he's just fucking enormous and super
fast twitching strong
he just glances at you and you fucking
blow up conor mcgregor's not very strong
not so explosive but he can put it where
he wants it
so yeah that's both play into that
ability
yeah so there's that skill component as
well right and then there's also the
tactics component like it's easy to like
get really good at punching a heavy bag
but it's not easy to hit someone else
who's trying to hit you back
so i think those things are very very
much at play and a lot of people tend to
dismiss those things but like
go ahead do if you can get your bench up
to 500 pounds you might think you have
knockout power go ahead and try and
knock someone out who doesn't want to be
knocked out see what happens
more likely you're going to hit them on
the arm or the head and not knock them
out or you might even just miss all
together
a couple other things to think about in
terms of skills and tactics especially
in a sport like mma
most of the punches being thrown except
for when you start when people really
start sitting down and throwing their
hips into their punches
most of them are thrown sub-maximally
why is that well
if you are just trying to throw your arm
out there as hard as you can
and try and push as far as it will go
what happens
it actually throws you off balance
especially if you miss
right so what most people will probably
will right
and so what most people will do is throw
kind of sub maximal level punches now
sometimes you'll see people really sit
down on it and throw in their whole body
into it right but more often than not
they're throwing stuff max so that they
can get the arm out and then recover
their guard
relatively quickly because if you just
throw the punch out there now you're
completely vulnerable on that side right
for another punch and everyone who's
been punched before
knows that because they've done that
yeah so and if they shake the guy
they can sit down into the next few
punches so the idea being like um
the more consistent the more um
the higher level of consistency that you
have in terms of the power output you
can put out
so you basically write your own let's
just i'm just making numbers up don't
quote me please don't quote me don't say
james said this number
don't just just in a thought experiment
but let's just say
in terms of your max punching power on
average you're throwing out
about 70 percent right and so you can
measure that in terms of like if it's an
impulse measurement or a wattage or
whatever
the idea being you can train so that
that average 70 percent
maybe you can get it up to like 75 or
maybe you stay at 70
but now the force or the power
measurement at 70 percent
has gone up significantly and you can
keep reproducing that same punch over
and over and over again with the pace
that you want
pair that with good skill development
and actually good tactics
that's what's really going to generate
the knockout power so i think people
spend too much time thinking about like
how much do i need to bench to be able
to knock someone out
like motherfucker you need to train
fighting if you want to be able to knock
someone out because they're not just
going to let you punch them especially
if you're somebody who looks like they
can bench 500 pounds they're probably
going to run away
yeah fuck that you know like don't i
think people put too much stock into the
fitness side of things and not into the
skills and tactics side of things so
what was that what did mike tyson say
everyone's got a plan until you get
punched in the mouth
right like there's i think i think that
plays a bigger role because
at the end of the day and like mike i'd
be curious to hear your take on this
i think the training for the fitness
portion a lot of this stuff is
relatively easy it's pretty
straightforward now
we obviously went to school even though
a lot of guys don't do it yeah right so
like
it's i don't want to undermine our own
our own education here but to me that's
kind of like straightforward and not
complicated whereas the other part of
like
how can i get my hand to consistently
land where i wanted to land on someone
who doesn't want it to land there
that's like where the real knockout
power comes from
i love that quote of everyone has a plan
until you get punched in the mouth
and like you fight habib for a round you
come back to your corner like coach i
punched him in the mouth a bunch he
still has a plan
yeah i know you're going to lose man
dude habib's gnarly
his fight against uh geichi um
i remember geisha went back to his
corner and his corner man's just like
what did he say he's like you gotta slow
down engage he was something to the
effect of like
i'm not pushing the pace he is
he keeps coming at me man what am i
supposed to do about that
that's a really sweet like demonstration
too and for me at least
of somebody with like a sport tactics
where it's like
you know exactly what he's gonna do he's
done it to all his opponents right
you have to be able to stop him and it's
like if he's that good at whatever thing
that he's doing that you can't like
yeah game over yeah but it's interesting
because you know it's coming right you
know
you know he's not gonna throw a fucking
spinning roundhouse kick and knock you
out
you know he's just gonna shove you on a
cage drag you down step over
get that arm behind the back and start
punching you yeah or choke you out
yeah crazy
[Applause]
[Music]
got it kino body
ah this is
says you should only do incline bench
press and avoid flat declining dips as
they prevent you
getting a square masculine chest that
looks like a plate of armor which he'd
know nothing about but whatever
which woman adore most women don't care
about chess
this is like he's selling you shit
anyway
um do you agree do those lifts give you
a feminine round chest
by activating the lower packs to high
degree or is it genetics so a muscular
lower chest doesn't look feminine it
looks fucking amazing
it looks like a full plate of armor
instead of half a plate of armor
i actually happen to have a much better
upper chest which is incredibly rare
than lower chest and i've actually
received critiques that are accurate
they're like your lower chest could
actually be bigger
does it take my upper chest is huge my
lower chest is kind of like
so fully developed packs means fully
developed packs now
because most people don't do as much
incline work as they do flat and most
people's lower packs are bigger than
upper packs
yes kinobody has a point that
prioritizing
more of your training to the upper packs
for most people is a good idea
but to do all of it and to do no lower
chest training
is for the birds james
yeah i don't blame you for for asking
those kind of questions i just hate
those kind of questions
and i'm sorry um james uh uh
finish up i'll be right back yeah so um
the reason why i don't like it is
because
um it's just total nonsense right like
what does a feminine round chest even
means like does mean that gives you
breasts like no
and like show me someone who does dips
and bench presses and steps on a stage
that has like a feminine looking
it's just like this is crazy it's just
like somebody who has not like mike said
he's just trying to sell you some shit
that doesn't make
any sense and he's just trying to use
like masculine and feminine as like um
provocative words to try and like get
you to bite down on his idea which has
a lack of substance so for me like
there's
you can get plenty good upper lower mid
all the above chest development from
doing
flat uh mostly flat stuff is it probably
a good idea like mike said to bias some
of yours towards incline work because
most people tend to be a little bit more
lacking in the incline
yeah sure but does that mean you just
abandon all the other ones all together
no i think that's like total nonsense uh
i didn't really know who kino body was
until pretty recently and scott hoon
sent me a couple videos and dude that
guy is
i'm sorry but he is just vomitorium just
awful just a slutatious hoe
awful awful awful so i would take
anything uh that he says with a pretty
good grain of salt because it just seems
like
yo nonsense i called kino body a
slutatious hoe
um that's basically where i left off
yeah yes most most of the stuff he says
is some grain of truth to it
it just likes to layer the bullshit on
top of that and again it's like it's an
easy grab to use like provocative words
like
this makes you look feminine like oh it
makes me look feminine like oh
no yeah it's easy when your argument has
no substance like
all right next up
oh consistent consistently delivers
mantas is the people's champ always gets
uploaded
he asks how significant
he is getting how significant can
i get some slight english thing how
significant is getting hyped
how significant can it improve
performance in various athletic
activities
does it mostly depend on the speed of
the movement and the number of motor
units
involved in it a few days ago i consumed
way more caffeine than usual
set a huge pr on the broad jump so yes
getting hyped
does absolutely increase your explosive
abilities more than something like
endurance abilities for which
if the endurance event is long enough
getting hyped can actually
be a bad thing because then you blow
your load early
but generally speaking for events less
than a minute
in length for sure and up to like five
um
getting hyped works there and it's very
significant
but it's also incredibly fatiguing so
you want to be careful about getting
hyped and training because i think
early part of training early
intermediates realize that if they get
hyped
they can get way bigger pr's and they
start to get hyped and training all the
time
and then they burn out so got to be
careful it does improve performance but
it's something i would save
more for competition than any other time
james
yeah and so i think like getting hyped
is really really good for
um low skill low tactic activities the
problem that you find is that
um when you have a system uh something
like power lifting right but when you
have things that are high skill
or high um like reaction
predictive like your typical kind of
sporting skills combat sport
yeah it tends to be really bad because
it actually takes you to a state of
alertness that's too high for the
activity in question right
and so that can actually be a huge
detriment when you're trying to do
something that requires a lot of skill
and or
tactic but for things that are purely
physical and don't require a lot of
i don't want to say skill but you know
our lowest as much skill yeah low on the
skill totem pole
um getting you know really aroused uh
can help a lot
i usually would not recommend um using
caffeine for that kind of you can i mean
i like to take pre-workout and stuff
like that but um
it's gonna be one of those things like
mike said that has a really severe
fatigue cost so
now you're like artificially inflating
how
hyped you can get because you took a
stimulant right so like
the cost of that is going to be more
than you realize until and you won't
know it until it's over
and that's the thing so you might get
really really hyped and have a great
performance on one or two things and
then all of a sudden you're just
completely wiped out and overreached on
something and that's what sucks and it's
bad enough when you just do it on your
own but then when you artificially
enhance that with like a stimulant
think about like okay like could i have
some great workouts if i took a whole
bunch of meth
like yeah i'd be hyped as fuck but i'd
also be wrecked afterwards right for a
variety of reasons
probably because the workout lasted like
three days um
i'm just kidding on that one but yeah it
definitely definitely works on some like
low skill uh like easy stuff like i
would say jumping like just from a
stationary position
really easy barbell sports yeah minus
weightlifting but
um that kind of stuff yeah for something
else like uh sporting
performance probably not yeah excellent
answer
the last question for today
um
j r j space r
oh my god jr some bitch
you guys are awesome thanks for doing
what you do
what's the worst cheap compliments yeah
compliments for another crew jr i'm just
kidding thanks um all right jr
finishes us off with what is the lowest
mrv you've seen per major
muscle group with your clients um
i'll see you james and i'll have
competition i'll see what outlandish
number we can say i will say
i've had a few people have a true
hamstring mrv
uh this is the end of a meza cycle
i can't do more sets than this and if i
tried i would get fucked up
hamstring mrv of four hard working sets
per week
um two hip hinges and then
two leg curls and they get doms like
insanity and it just never really gets
more work capacity built and they just
can't do anymore
um i remember uh rp plus og daniel jolly
had a true hamstring mrv of like six or
eight
and this is like he was like i'm trying
to train hamstrings three times a week
but it doesn't work
oh i remember to be twice a week i can
only do like three sets of leg curls and
i can't do any more
but danny like the best problem possible
like i wish my quad mrv was four so i
didn't have to fucking suffer as much
so i would say that yeah mrv of four for
hamstrings
i've never seen an mrv lower than that
um i've had some like funny instances
where i've had people basically
overreach with no physical efforts
where they just you just like send them
the program they're like i can't i'm
like too fucked up like did you even
start again they're like no
like we just looked at it and panicked
what happened
mrv like no physical efforts um
that is a thing strangely enough but i'm
trying to think of it like hamstrings is
usually the first one that comes to mind
for most people because it's so low i
have had people
like what ends up what i find ends up
happening is you start to see
like overuse injuries at pre like
seemingly really low levels for example
i have like one client who
um their biceps like most people can
handle some bicep volume right like it's
not the hardest muscle in the world
they won't hit like an mrv in a
performance uh
standpoint so everything looks fine
but there's like somewhere around the
like 20 sets mark
um just starts seeing like overuse
injuries where this person i know could
probably
tolerate like 40 sets now you might say
like well 20 is still really high it's
like yeah if you knew who this person
was that you'd understand they could
probably do like 50 of everything and
you'd be fine
so sometimes you see that kind of stuff
where it seems artificially low
and everything seems fine performance
wise but then they start like getting
weird injuries and stuff like that
that's more often what i see is like uh
not so much a performance so much as
just like they start getting hurt
from stuff i have a similar one i think
you and i have both experienced it too
is that um asynchronicity
of mrv with muscles usually train
as part of a group and one really just
fucks the other ones
um adductors for uh squatting and like
oh i've done that like i could do so
much more quad volume but my addictors
are like no
go fuck yourself and then you have to do
more isolation stuff which is fine it's
a great way around it
but it's almost like like someone's
asked like why don't you just squat for
all your volume because multiple parts
of me would fall apart before my quads
would
i have done so that's a really good low
mr because i've done this mistake and i
haven't learned from it yet which is
really stupid
where i if i take out high bar squats
for a long time and i put them back into
the mix
my adductor is overreach on the first
set and i'm like what is happening to my
adductors
and you just forget like oh i've been
close stance squatting forever no and i
haven't been using them that much they
basically deconditioned
it's a real thing and that's one of the
big reasons why we're such big fans of
cycling volume specifically starting low
specifically if you haven't done an
exercise in a while like
the james and i one of the craziest
things is like people put in a new
exercise
and they're like start with five by ten
like yeah
like try that with lunges if you haven't
done lunges in three months
after two sets your glutes will start to
have benign fasciculations like they'll
just contract by themselves
and then after three sets you're gonna
start cramping physically when you try
to descend
and after four sets you're gonna start
cramping just laying down
and you'll have what uh some of our
friends have uh genuinely termed
uh ioms instant onset muscle soreness
where we're just like oh i'm sore like
right now not like in 12 hours
and like you know because we know
there's a relationship a u-shaped curve
between damage and hypertrophy
don't kid yourself where on that curve
you are if you have fucking ions
you just did way too much and so it's
good better much better to come start
doing one or two sets
especially get the ghetto mev indicators
like do i have a massive pump yes
are my muscles much weaker than when i
started yes like it's time to shut it
down
what more am i gonna do here uh another
stupid food analogy it's like going to
the cheesecake factory you've never been
and like halfway through your meal
you're like i'm sick i should stop
eating
and they're like well no nonsense you go
to a restaurant you know the food they
put in front of you like who the fuck
said that's
there's no rule that says that you take
it to go bag
and you can do that with your workout
too just take your lunches to go no i'm
just kidding just leave them
and then come back next time and do
three sets instead of two and sometimes
people james you ever notice that
clients
and just like even just you and i like
just as people who train
have this like weird thing of like we
think there's like third party watcher
judging us and be like what kind of
person would i be if i only did two sets
of lunges today
like that's not a real workout and it's
like
somebody works yeah like what the fuck
are you talking about like am i pumped
yes am i
gonna be sore yes but you're so freaking
done like i've literally had clients be
like
i only do two sets but i feel like i can
do more i'm like are you pumped
like dude i can barely walk i'm like so
when you say you feel like you can do
more what exactly do you mean and then
they're like well
i just feel like it's it was really like
wussified
workout to write down that i only did
two sets i'm like who's reading your
workouts other than me or you
yeah you should like this like it's like
a
stigma with that but really like if you
if you got what you needed out of two
sets that means like you've been doing
something right
you're winning yeah exactly like whether
it was what you did today or like the
things that led you to today which
only required you to do two sets like
that all that collectively is like
you've been
on point with your training stuff that's
a good thing the other problem is much
worse you're like i've done eight sets
of lunges and i don't feel anything like
yeah often skeptical eyes are like it's
by no means clear what it is you
actually did
i'm in that like meso two area where i'm
up to doing like
six to seven sets per muscle group and
i'm just like ugh this workout's gonna
be
fucking off you look at it with the last
week and you're like
it's gonna be a lot of work out today
and you're like i hope i don't get a
pump on this set and you're like nope
still getting pumped like keep going
like god
damn it set number eight still pumped
like fuck
all right here we go yeah folks that's
it that's
all we have all right that was a good
one okay so folks uh nick shaw's book
is out and about make sure you check
that out i had a chance to read it it's
really really good i think it's called
fit for success if i'm not mistaken
it's on amazon nick shaw is the founder
and ceo of rp and
he's you know been a lifetime athlete
and really like
he's coached a ton of people he doesn't
do that anymore because he runs the
company but
he's also a wildly successful
gazillionaire businessman
and he kind of is in this book sharing
distilled thoughts of what he's come to
a conclusion of
he's done a ton of reading and research
for this book of like
if you are you don't even have to be in
fitness but a lot of people listen to
like your webinar like this you guys
train your own clients
you know you have a fitness business
with even if it's just yourself
and you want to get this fit as possible
yourself and also you want the most
business success
and next book really just talks about
the intersection of those two and it
just lays down like some basic
principles of like just do shit like
this and you'll be successful
and i know it sounds lame you're like
that's a stupid self-help book thing is
stupid sell help books
fucking work it's just most people don't
apply to shit
so you buy his book you apply the shit
and it's like is it going to turn you
into an overnight success fuck no you
got to have talent
and persevere for that but whatever
talent you do have if you persevere and
do the right shit that he says in the
book
don't do a ton of the wrong shit you're
going to do real well for yourself
because like dude i've seen so many
people
have reached out to me over the years
and i'm not even the expert nick is on
the success bullshit
okay i'm trying to get my personal
training thing going i'm trying to be an
online influencer
you know you're super popular how did
you do it and like i see the kind of
shit they
post and the kind of shit they do and
don't do and i'm like you're not
you need to look up some like basic
seven habits of highly effective p like
they'll do the shit where they're like
i'm really grinding and then like half
their posts on instas like
stupid memes and they're like i'm really
bored what should i do guys like what
the fuck the fuck are you bored you
should have an infinite laundry list of
things to
get you to the top of fitness and and
it's just like
if you read this book it's probably not
going to be this huge revelation
but it's going to be like goddammit i
know this shit and it really gets you to
do something about it
and if you want success it's a fucking
great thing to have in your back pocket
yeah not to to lick nick's balls too
much here but um one thing i enjoyed
about the book
is uh despite all those things that mike
already said i think a lot of people one
of the hurdles they'll always say is
like oh i can't like change all these
habits or behaviors because i got all
this other bullshit going on
well read nick's book and tell me about
the bullshit going on in your life
because
nick had to deal with some pretty heavy
stuff and he was very candid about it in
the book so
i don't want to give any spoilers most
of you might already know no it's not a
spoiler because it's on the fucking it's
on the cover it's on the fucking amazon
description i'll just tell it really
quick
nick's wife got cancer during coven 19.
like she's doing chemo and she's like
officially like can't
aggressively fucking die yeah like that
shit is
and and he start he has two children at
home who they don't go to school anymore
because people don't go to school
anymore
and he's got to run this like mega
company while dealing with all that shit
and it's like oh fuck i better know some
shit about how to get shit done
otherwise like
you know yeah like your life might be
tough but god damn i'm just fucking
happy i'm not in that position
like selfishly like holy fuck yeah so

good

feedback from chad sooner or later
doctor mike in the word
there's a street close to where we live
in vegas electric avenue
yes you know that's like a weird
controversial political song it turns
out
i like to think of it as a disco song
um i believe the street name crystal and
i were doing my wife and i were doing
cardio
and uh we passed the street name and
instantly thought of chad
because the street name i believe was
called royal ascot
way and i was like
[Music]
we felt poor just walking by that street
and it was the street it was a street
that's really a driveway that leads into
a gated community
and it's not like a gated community
where there's like digital gates that
swing open
there's one of those little booths where
there's a human being who lets you know
if you can get in
and i was like baby call chad
leslie that's like really a royal ascot
where
like as if an ascot wasn't highbrow
enough a royal ascot
is a shit made of mithril or something i
mean seriously like can you imagine like
telling people where you live
like hey come through the party here's
the address and then like you next text
you sent he's like
you don't have to dress up i know the
street name is called that it's just a
name
don't feel too intimidated just tell the
guy who you're coming it'll let you in
it's not as big of a deal as it sounds
no i'll just put you on the list don't
worry about it
i'll put you on list you have to wear a
tuxedo when i say don't dress up i mean
like in a super
custom tuxedo you gotta rent one because
