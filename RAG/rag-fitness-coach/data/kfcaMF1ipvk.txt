hey folks dr michael vitell here for
renaissance periodization someday i'll
learn how to say my last name
in complete syllables lifting
versus cardio sort of like mothra vs
godzilla
the fight we all wanted to see here it
is
specifically not which one's better
because they're for different things
how do we best combine the two but i'll
give you that trademark
rp value by doing a real deep dive on
the theoretical and practical
underpinnings of how they're different
why they're different what mechanisms
they target and then finally we'll talk
about if you want to do some of both for
certain goals
how do you go about doing it so we're
going to talk about first
lifting and cardio characteristics
because they are quite a bit different
they're not just two
pretty close to the same thing we're
going to talk about the inherent
trade-offs there are
and if you do some amount of lifting
versus some extra amount of cardio what
pluses and minuses exist they're very
very well documented
we're going to talk about cardio
modalities ways of doing cardio like
cycling versus swimming versus
incline walking that are most or least
interfering with lifting
we're going to talk about cardio amounts
how much cardio
causes interference that's notable and
how much doesn't
we're going to talk about cardio timing
to lifting huge super
often asked question and then we're
going to talk about the best cardio for
your goals
be it if you have maximum fat loss as
your goal with muscle retention
or just maximum weight loss because we
actually find two different kinds of
cardio
to be better for one versus the other so
without further ado
lifting and cardio characteristics
lifting
produces very high forces produces a lot
of fatigue
relative to how much work you do makes
you stronger and quite a bit healthier
and of course puts on muscle
grows and retains muscle in a deficit if
a deficit is present
and it burns a decent amount of calories
when you're going really hard with high
volume
but if we were to surmise a stimulus to
fatigue ratio for calorie burning
like how much calorie burning are we
getting for how much fatigue we're
getting out of it
very very poor stimulus to fatigue ratio
for lifting
because like lifting burns quite a bit
of calories not that many nothing to
write home about
but holy shit isn't high fatigue and
lifting messes you up
per calorie like you wouldn't believe on
the other hand cardio is slightly
different
low force outputs generally moderate
level of total fatigue comes out of that
it causes you to become more endurant so
a higher level of endurance and
a lot healthier it's great for your
health it does
risk some muscle loss especially for
well-trained people that got there
through lifting weights
it burns a lot of calories when going
very hard not just
a moderate amount like lifting but
because its fatigue isn't insane
the stimulus to fatigue ratio for
calorie burning for cardio is
excellent right these differences are
going to start to reflect themselves in
recommendations we make later on in this
video
so trade-offs a lot of people
certainly no one watching this video you
guys are too sharp for that
i used to think this as well you do
lifting because it gets you jacked
and then you do cardio because it gets
you leaner and more endurance you could
just do more of both
and they just get you more of both and
voila so a lot of people say hey
should i do cardio in my lifting plan a
lot of people's answer is like yeah of
course it gives you all these cardio
benefits
but it comes with costs and if you're
super into cardio like you're an
endurance athlete
lifting isn't free either they directly
compete on oh at least
seven conceptual levels here they are
first of all time time spent lifting
could be spent doing cardio or vice
versa
if you are a high level endurance
athlete you spend
geez maybe like 30 or 40 hours a week
during endurance training or
doing some kind of endurance training
something like that that could be time
spent
that you could be lifting instead and if
you do invest yourself heavily
into lifting as an address athlete you
could be alternately using that time
to do more cardio instead becoming
better at your sport instead of doing
lifting and becoming
more jacked but not that much better
your sport time is finite doing more
cardio versus more lifting
and this is especially true with people
with real world schedules like you and i
well i sort of have a real world
schedule i live in youtube land we don't
even i'm not a fucking real person
so you know you have five
days a week where you can train and you
have an hour each time because then you
come home and the wife and kids like
they just eat your soul right that's a
pessimistic view of suburban life in
america you have an hour
each day for sure to yourself if you
want to get better at cardio
you know some of the lifting sessions
are going to have to reduce in scope or
they're going to have to go
so it's absolutely a constraint in the
real world as well as theoretically
maximum recoverable volume your
recovery from lifting goes pretty well
until unless you start doing a lot of
cardio
and then that recovery gets shifted to
powering and recovering that cardio
and the same way if you're running at a
very high level competitively if you do
a shitload of lifting
that's recovery that could have
recovered you for more cardio that
you're putting into lifting instead
it absolutely interferes all right which
is
one of the reasons why we don't see
super jacked endurance runners often
because geez that's a lot of recovery
and your body only has so much and you
can't do maximum lifting and maximum
cardio and recover from everything at
the same time
point number three place of interference
acute fatigue
so mrv that's like systemic and chronic
cumulative fatigue
acute fatigue is like especially if you
do cardio before lifting
your lifting is much tougher and much
less productive
on the other hand if you do lifting
before cardio
maybe you can have a good cardio session
especially if it's upper body lifting
and lower body cardio but look if you're
really
competitive you want to run like this 5k
coming up at the best time possible you
don't do legs and go
do cardio after because your fucking
cardio is bullshit your legs are jello
so acute fatigue is absolutely a thing
and that sometimes takes hours and hours
to come down before we can have another
productive
maximally productive workout of that
different type so if you lift it's going
to have to be real far away from cardio
and vice versa if you want really
close to your best results number four
molecular signaling
okay when you do cardio cardio directly
signals
a reduction in muscle growth and
potentially if taken to extremes muscle
loss
in proportion to its weekly total volume
so if you do a lot of cardio you are
impeding your ability to grow muscle
full stop specifically to the local
musculature that you're doing cardio
with
so if you're doing a shit load of
running you probably won't have legs
nearly as big as you could have had
had you just done most lifting in a
minimum amount of cardio or no cardio at
all
number five nutrient competition this is
a big one
a lot of folks like to do their lifting
and then do cardio after in which they
drink their post-workout shake well
guess what a lot of that post-workout
shake isn't going to go to your muscles
that you just got done lifting
let's say your upper body that day what
you're doing cardio
a lot of that shake just fuels the
literal operation of the muscles that
you're using for cardio or once you stop
cardio
for recovering your muscles that just
did cardio there's a recency thing
with muscles and nutrient uptake the
muscles that
worked the most recently that were just
finished working the soonest
they're the ones that are most nutrient
sensitive so if two hours ago you
finished training upper body
but 10 minutes ago you finished training
cardio for lower body and you slam a
carbohydrate and whey protein shake
eventually when that gets absorbed and
uh digested and absorbed
a lot of it's going gonna go to the legs
that just did cardio because they're
probably just more sensitive for
nutrients
and the lifting muscles in the upper
body they'll get plenty but not as much
as they could have
and that's the thing this isn't the
place for absolute statements it's not
like your muscles are just fucking
straight robbed of all the nutrition no
if you have a big enough shake both get
some
but there's a trade-off there where
ideally if you want
maximum muscle recovery you start doing
too much cardio
some of that food is powering the cardio
recovery or power and cardio energy and
it's just not getting to the muscles
where it could be a little bit more
advantageous
wear and tear this is a big one
if you do a shitload of cardio and a
schedule of lifting they all add up to
wear and tear
if you run 20 miles a week
you're just gonna have some knee ankle
and hip issues pop up every now and
again
in lifting that would never have popped
up or would have popped up years later
if ever
if you hadn't been doing that much
mileage someone to follow
is just an awesome resource in general
on social media is a gentleman named
alex viado he's a very very
standout endurance athlete as well as a
really strong lifter
if you want a picture image of someone
that has to deal with these constraints
realistically
he talks about injury management all the
time because he gets injured
or he has to deal with injuries in
lifting that come from cardio
and the other way around and if you just
do one or the other you just don't have
these kinds of concerns nearly as much
lastly fat loss versus muscle loss
okay a lot of lifting gains and retains
a ton of muscle
more cardio usually does mean more fat
loss but at a certain point
it increases muscle loss risk so i don't
want you guys to see
cardio as this like all-powerful sword
of fat loss with no downsides it
absolutely causes tons of fat loss but
it risks
dampening your muscle growth a little
bit if uh taken to
a slightly more extreme and even risking
muscle loss if you're doing a lot of
cardio and you're hypocaloric at the
same time
so it's a trade-off you have to
understand is there
lifting is really good for your muscles
cardio is really really good for fat
loss but it comes with some muscle
downsides so that's something to
remember
we go to final recommendations later all
right
point number three if we're choosing
cardio modalities
okay let's say muscle is super important
to us
most of you folks watching this channel
are probably into being jacked and
strong
but you may have heard about some of the
benefits of cardio specifically for
burning fat
enhancing health so on and so forth
those are all true
but some modalities of cardio some ways
of doing cardio interfere more
with muscle and strength than others and
here just with some examples and you can
sort of interpolate the rest in your own
head
of very common forms of cardio from
least interfering all the way down to
most
interfering modalities the ones at the
top of the list point number one and two
and three
they don't really hurt your lifting all
that much at the bottom of the list
points you know
five six and seven man they really take
it out of your lifting
and using them in the context of you
want muscle to be super important and
your strength is super important
either they need to be used very
judiciously which we'll get to how to do
later
or ideally not at all so here it is neat
not exercise activity thermogenesis just
you moving around
i you will notice have a step tracker on
kind of at all times
it tells me how many steps i'm getting i
have a rough goal of 10 000 steps a day
i'll get to that in a second as to
why that's the goal and i just sort of
walk around move around when i'm on
podcast or something i'll try to walk
around the room
or if i'm on business calls or something
i'll walk around the block i'll do
a cardio quote-unquote but just moving
around adds up
and it's very very very low interference
i mean you've got to walk like fucking
10 miles a day or something for your
legs to start really feeling the burden
on your systemic fatigue to feel the
burden to hurt your lifting
because neat is so sporadic and
interspersed there's never this
big sort of highly catabolic signal of
really hard
exercise it's spread throughout the day
and it's never very high intensity
it's got absolutely the least
interference so if
your muscle is the most worthwhile to
you most of your cardio
if your physical activity other than
lifting will come
from neat from just moving around and
being physically active period
next up as you could probably have
surmised is purposeful walking
on an incline or flat but that results
in
under 120 beats per minute heart rate
okay
north of 120 beats per minute like your
heart's working pretty fucking hard
that's pretty fatiguing
uh it's not that your heart itself gets
fatigued it actually
hardly does that at all because your
heart is the most enduring organ you
have pretty much
um it's that needing to get to an
intensity where your heart has to beat
that much means the local muscles are
working
real hard there's a little bit more
fatigue involved in that but as long as
it's under 120 beats per minute the
fatigue is relatively minimal
not as good as neat but still pretty
damn good so if you have to have extra
formal cardio in your plan
you just don't get enough need because
you mostly just sit in your car or sit
at your desk
this is absolutely the way to go number
three a little bit more interfering
is the elliptical because it's no impact
that's why it's not lower down on this
list
at sub 140 beats per minute so sub 140
that's
you're burning fat like fucking awesome
pace at 135 to 140 beats per minute
heart rate for most people on the
elliptical oh my god
the calorie burning is fucking ludicrous
but because it's not impacting because
it's not a crazy
uh high heart rate the interference is
yeah it's number three
it's getting there but it's not nearly
as high as it could be and as far as
stimulus to fatigue ratio
for how much calorie burning you get
versus fatigue it's still really really
really good highly recommended if you
have real serious fat loss goals
but muscle loss is something you don't
want or want to minimize as much as
possible next up
and this is now number four so we're
sort of on the other end of this list
um or i guess idiot number four sort of
right in the middle
uh sub 160 beats per minute cycling
which is like pretty hard cycling but
not super intense not going over hills
and stuff like that
or hard swimming why swimming because
swimming has basically no impact
whatsoever
you're not hitting the ground all the
time gravity's not a factor but swimming
is pretty fucking hard it uses your
whole body
like you don't get out of a pretty tough
swim being like oh that was easy i'm
gonna go train with weights like your
your arms and legs are noodles at that
point
but because it's uh essentially zero
impact
it's not terrible so it's right there in
the middle of like this is some pretty
fucking intense cardio
it's gonna cost your lifting but like
run of the sort of middle of the road
cost your lifting
now point number five we start getting
into the modalities that really
interfere with lifting
both size and strength jogging high
intensity interval training no matter
what the fuck anybody told you
high intensity interval training causes
a fuck load of fatigue
it causes joint fatigue because a lot of
times it's really pounding on your
joints
and in order to get enough calories with
high intensity interval training
to be burned to significantly affect
your fat loss you're going to have to do
a fuck load of it and that costs you a
shitload of fatigue it is very
interfering
a lot of the studies have caught up and
found that this is now the case it's not
nearly the big fat burner we used to
think maybe 10 years ago
jogging equally it's just not that
fucking great what could be worse you
may you may ask team sport hard training
cause if you play
soccer hard basketball hard still the
way i play sports bro
i'm a fucking competitor you know what
i'm saying jk i suck at all those sports
so basketball soccer etc in team sports
hilariously enough we put things like
mma jiu jitsu boxing so on and so forth
that's tough stuff and you have bouts of
maximal activity
intra spurts with bouts of submaximal
activity all of those drain the living
fuck out of you
they cause tons of connective tissue
disruption it's a big deal okay
if you have a full-time basketball
addiction you're not going to be getting
your biggest all time that you could be
same with soccer so on and so forth
right it's no coincidence that these
folks are not the most jacked people on
the planet
number seven competition-paced endurance
sport
massively interferes at essentially
every level with lifting
which is one of the reasons why the guys
that are the best in the world in
endurance
are fucking tiny and super skinny that
makes sense right
even if they wanted to train which i've
seen them try to do it is hilarious
they just don't gain much muscle without
having to pull back on their volume a
ton so if you're really just sick and
tired of having jacked legs
you got to do competition endurance
sport don't you worry your legs will
surely be not nearly as jacked so
that's to give you guys a really good
perspective here so that you don't pick
a cardio modality and ignorance does
that mean you shouldn't be doing
competition-based endurance or fuck this
shit is fun as fuck it's healthy shit
and it's real world because you get
you know zombie apocalypse i don't know
how many zombies you can bench press off
you but you're
fucking run away from a bunch of them
right i guess that's not really real
world because zombies aren't real or
scientifically possible
sorry to be the one that burst your
bubble if that's the case but in any
case there's nothing wrong with the very
interfering modalities
i just want you guys to know which ones
are more interfering which ones are
least to make intelligent choices so if
you
basketball is super fucking important to
you fucking awesome
just don't be confused why your squat on
ram hasn't gone up in a year
right but if you want to make a run a
competitive bodybuilding and you're
still playing basketball or doing like
jogging
fuck man somebody's gotta talk you out
of that shit i guess that would be me in
this presentation
all right what about amounts of cardio
we figured out modalities but what about
amounts how much cardio is too much
super common question
in my view and this is not just randomly
assigned that's
quite a bit of research behind this so
on and so forth
up to about 10 000 steps a day and
perhaps significantly more many cases
of neat or purposeful activity just
steps
as far as walking fast walking incline
walking can
possibly be a net benefit to strength
and physique in most cases
because it makes you leaner and
healthier and may actually boost your
ability
primarily because those two things to
recover right
so being just generally pretty well
active is probably a good thing and in
some
extreme cases shot putters weight
lifters uh high jumpers that may amount
of cardio me
ultra fiber types just enough to make it
a little bit sub-optimal maybe something
like 5000 steps is best for them
but in general for most of us who want
to be jack mean and strong up to 10 000
steps a day
is fucking awesome boost your health so
on and so forth so
in addition to that something like 300
calories
of pretty hard elliptical work uh most
days of the week totally fine and
anything you know 100 200 300 calories
is all within that realm of a net
benefit keeps you healthy or keeps you
leaner which is fucking sweet
um and even 20 minutes of swimming most
days of the week
so i'll put it to you this way real
world right if someone tells me hey like
i'm having trouble
like putting on mass and strength eating
is not a problem i can gain weight it's
just like a feeling my workouts aren't
as quality
i feel a little bit tired is it the
cardio and i'll be like what do you do
for cardio like you know i swim
i do a swimming workout that's pretty
decent gets me
pretty pumped up for 20 minutes five
days a week is that the issue i'll be
like
nah it's not the fucking issue right now
if they say like i swim for 40 minutes
five days a week i'll be like oh yeah
you know we could swim less and it'll
probably be better
right that if they say they're doing 300
calories of elliptical if they're
getting up to 10 000 or even
uh maybe even up to 15 000 in many cases
steps a day
and 20 minutes of swimming that's really
just not number one concern for high
interference and
within that from zero to that much
cardio
is there's some sort of bell curve shape
there for net benefit for every
individual
we're doing zero cardio could actually
be worse for you than doing somewhere
between
you know zero and ten thousand steps a
day for example so nothing i would ever
worry about doesn't count as interfering
in almost any case
right anything more than that especially
much more
it's just a known trade-off to lifting
like if someone or you know
led hiking troops as a job or something
like that out in uh wyoming wilderness
and they get 30 000 steps a day and
they're like hey look like i train legs
it's just interfering you'd be like well
yeah yeah it is not the end of the world
but yeah it's
of course it's fucking interfering
that's a shitload of steps your legs are
always fatigued
they never have quite enough time to
recover so on and so forth and of course
all those other
uh interference pathways that we talked
about in one of the first slides
in the other modalities so this is just
for elliptical swimming
sort of you know moderate activity
swimming and
walking incline included
pretty much most things in the other
modalities
at any amount starts to trade off in
most cases cycling look if you ride your
bike to working back that's not a
fucking big deal
we're talking about cycling where you're
getting on the bike to accomplish some
kind of performance goal
in that case it's going to start to wear
on your quads and hamstrings a little
bit and it will cost you a little bit
jogging man jogging is just not super
compatible especially with lower body
strength
any amount of jogging is probably going
to take away from that high intensity
interval training bangs the fuck out of
your body not the greatest idea in the
world
if you need it for your sport it's
needed for your sport but to potentiate
lifting it's probably best you do none
of it
you'll notice that essentially almost
zero high-level bodybuilders do any of
these things by the way
not by accident sometimes it is by
accident it's just fucking lazy in this
case they're right
endurance uh sport training duh right if
you want to be the best guy at your work
at the 5k
look at your legs and appreciate the
fuck out of them one last time
until you do your 5k training program
and then get back into squatting and
dump away
endurance running and of course team
support training and this team sports
stuff comes up a lot because some people
like
they love to play soccer with their
buddies or rugby or so on and so forth
or awkwardly you know i've included
boxing and mma and jiu jitsu and that
like yeah it fucking costs and i do uh
jiu jitsu
and i i do it two to four times a week
nowadays i mean doing it only two times
a week generally because i want to
prioritize bodybuilding more
it sucks because juice is really fun but
i'm under no illusions that that's
fucking costing me it costs me
many injuries it costs me a ton of
fatigue and finding another human being
is fucking difficult
especially when their assholes don't
want to cooperate let you just choke
them right so
the shit is it takes it out of you right
and if you say well i only play
basketball
three times a week for 40 minutes like
if you were gunning to win
a show and bodybuilding i would say it's
fucking time to cut that shit out right
if you were like well i really like
basketball
awesome but it's a known trade-off it is
a trade-off there's no free lunch there
all right what about cardio timing to
lifting if you're going to do both
when is it best to do one versus the
other if
cardio is most important to you so if
you're viewing this video as a runner or
a cyclist or something like that
you want to for sure keep lifting as far
away from cardio
in the day essentially as possible
preferably at least four hours
so if you do your main cardio workout at
eight am
to you know one pm two pm maybe
preferably six pm you can do your
lifting or something like that
and you want to lift after cardio never
before so your big workout of the day
needs to be fresh for cardio because
that's your priority you can always lift
later now
you could say well when i lift after
cardio much later
my lifting doesn't go all that great
what a fucking shit but you just told me
cardio is the most important
thing to you that's what you need to
prioritize you can't have the best of
all worlds that's already impossible we
just have to make the trade-offs that we
are capable of within the constraints
now if lifting is most important to you
i
surmise most of you are in this category
watching this video
same thing applies as last time you want
to keep your lifting and cardio as far
apart as possible so i'll tell you this
and i won't
put too fine a point in him but if you
do your lifting and you do your cardio
right after
if there's any way for you to separate
those two and do the cardio much later
do it
if you're a professional bodybuilder
you're lifting your cardio right after
you're doing things not optimally you
should be lifting and then the number
one thing you should do after lifting
is sitting the fuck down and having
recovery food and not stressing for the
next several hours
ideally cardio after lifting not a good
idea not remotely optimal
right now if the cardio
is on the easier side very limited
amount
20 to 30 minutes mostly walking or
incline walking
what you want to do is do your cardio
first if you have to do them together
ideally you spread them apart if you
have to do them together if the cardio
is on an easier side
then you can do cardio ideally before
lifting
because what that does is it actually
warms you up for lifting pretty well
doesn't sap your energy
you have a hard lift right after and
then you get right to recovering and
eating for lifting
on the other hand if the cardio was on
the harder end
you're playing basketball or something
like that well recreational basketball
because
lifting before basketball is going to
make you suck running especially
training upper body and then running
if the actual running or cycling if the
cardio is on the harder end
you want to lift before cardio and not
after because
after basketball or after cycling or
after running
your lifting is gonna be pure dog shit
because you prioritize lifting
this way you can have a great workout
maybe step on a shake during cardio and
have a sort of measured response there
where at least you had a great stimulus
not the greatest recovery in the world
but hey
you had to combine them again ideally
you spread them as far apart in the day
as they can possibly be or within
wreaths
if both are equally important to you
your lifting and cardio are equally
important to you
you want to keep them as far apart in
the day as you can in most
most cases i think i made that point
pretty clearly by now i'll stop
repeating myself
and you want to lift before cardio in
most cases
because lifting performance is higher
threshold higher output
it takes a bigger hit from cardio than
cardio does from lifting
in most cases there are reversals of
that for example in high technique
sports like basketball
if you lift upper body before you play
basketball you're going to suck because
you're going to be butterfingers
in that case do basketball first and
then do your lifting as best as you can
i know it blows ideally take a 10 or 20
minute break if you have the time
get some hydration and you get a little
bit of carbohydrate and then hit it so
more time you can even minutes matter at
that point
but if you for example are doing a
marathon training program or a couch to
5k program or something that's real
important to you
or you're cycling and it's real
important to you lifting first is a good
idea
because if you're tired from lifting you
can still have a pretty good endurance
workout
and a great lifting workout because you
were fresh but if you flip it the other
way around
a lot of times you have very good cardio
workout but your lifting suffers
way more because we're assuming they're
both equally important to you it's a
better balance if you usually do your
lifting first
but ideally you want to highly consider
if they're both
important to you having priority phases
where for several
weeks or months at a time you really
prioritize your cardio lifting goes a
little back burner you maintain all your
muscle not gain
and then a couple uh months later or
weeks later you have another stretch of
weeks or months
where you do a shitload of lifting and
less cardio just keeping in shape
and your lifting of course goes first at
that point so on and so forth
and you do that right the priority
phases can really really let you
push one then push the other push one
push the other and that's a huge
advantage
something to consider if both are
equally important to you
all right so wrapping all of this up
what is the best cardio modality for
your goals
and how do you pull it off if your goal
and there's just a couple of goals here
two really maximum
retention of muscle while losing fat
and maximum pure weight loss you just
fucking need to lose like
30 pounds and you don't really give a
shit about how muscular you are
that's a lot of people if you want
maximum muscle retention with a really
good amount of fat loss
you for sure point number one you want
to do the least interfering cardio
modalities
whichever ones you can pick that are the
least interfering the highest stop on
that list on another slide
that's best all right ideally all of
it's neat maybe some incline walking
the lower you go on that list the worse
it is
next point start with a small amount of
cardio and ease in
okay you don't want to start with like
three hours a day or 20 000 steps a day
when you normally do eight
because you're gonna burn out like crazy
pretty common sense
only add cardio as the diet progresses
if you need to how do you determine if
you need to
if you're on track for your weight loss
goals you're fucking golden don't add
anything
if you're not on track for weight loss
goals you have to do sort of a
bifurcated analysis
you have to look forward to the next
week and say to yourself okay
i need to increase the magnitude of my
deficit because my weight loss is no
longer on track i need to lose weight
faster
if i do more cardio
what will the effect on my total fatigue
be
or if i do the same amount of cardio but
eat less food
what will the total effect on my fatigue
be sometimes the answer of like well
they both evenly suck
there's your answer raise cardio a
little bit drop food a little bit
because they evenly suck
on the other hand you could be in a
position where you're doing a fuckload
of cardio already
and you're actually eating quite a bit
of food and you never really feel hungry
like dude fuck that i'm not gonna do 18
000 steps a day from the current 14
000 i'm doing i'm just going to eat a
little less food because eating less
food's not going to be that big of a
bother it's not going to fatigue me that
much
but like doing more cardio dude fuck
that i'm already at the max of how much
cardio i want to do at this point
then you cut the food on the other hand
if you're doing like
pretty decent amount of cardio but
you're not gonna fucking do more cardio
like push comes to shove
but you look at your food and you're
already kind of not a starvation levels
but you're like dude fuck that i want
every bit of food to stay as long as
possible then you increase the deficit
from cardio alone
and everything in between pretty simple
formula there for you to decide it
remember
it's all a personal choice you just have
to be sort of thoughtful enough
forward thinking enough to be okay next
week this change has to happen
what is the least fatiguing way for me
to engineer this change is some
combination of both or more of one or
all of one or all of the other
right lastly real big recommendation
on this muscle retentive fat loss phase
diet for at most 10
body weight loss uh at one time usually
for at most 12 weeks at a time in a
hypocaloric state
then take a break where you maintain
your lost weight or
lost body fat for two thirds as long at
least as long as the diet was so if you
diet for all the 12 weeks
at least for the next eight weeks don't
do any fat loss dieting
and during that time do no formal cardio
or much less cardio
and don't lose any weight that will
recharge you replenish you so you can do
another fat loss phase later and still
keep your muscle
if you go for 16 20 weeks if you lose
12 or 14 percent of your body weight so
on and so forth
man it's going to lead to some much
higher risk of muscle loss
next and last what if your goal is
maximum weight loss you just fucking
need to lose the weight
you're not a bodybuilder you don't give
a flying fuck you just want to lose
weight
and just not look like kate moss skinny
at the end here's what you do
you want to find the cardio that gives
you the best stimulus to fatigue ratio
that means you can do a fuck load of it
and it doesn't beat you up as much
and not just a lot of cardio physically
you're doing you can burn a lot of
calories with that cardio but it doesn't
mess you up
a lot and a lot of this comes down to
preference as well as physiology and
anatomy
if you really like the elliptical
fucking go ham
if you really like high intensity
interval training just make sure you're
doing not so much of it that your joints
are really paying the price
accumulative wise but you can still do
plenty of it because it's something you
can consistently do so pick the shit you
like
and the stuff that you can burn a lot of
calories with a lot of times that means
you're going to
rotate several modalities it's not about
picking the best it's about having a
good variety
maybe two days of the week you'll go to
the local ymca and you'll swim in the
pool for an hour at a time maybe another
two days a week
you jump on the cycle ergometer or you
take your bike around some trails
and then the rest of the time you do a
high level of meat and some elliptical
boom that's a fucking perfect planet
it's a really good plan because if you
only did cycling your knees might start
to hurt if you only did
swimming your shoulders might start to
hurt but because you combine all of them
you never do enough of one that really
taxes the local structures
much nor does it bore you much so it's
an awesome fresh mix and hey throw in a
couple days of basketball as well
that's awesome as long as it's
sustainable it's not a ton of fatigue it
burns a ton of calories
and super importantly you actually i was
gonna say like doing it at the worst
don't hate doing it the most pick the
shit you hate the least
or love the most any combination of
those works really really great
that being said a couple of extra tips
for you guys trying to lose the most
weight that you can
or within a certain time frame and goal
nothing can outdo
can out cardio a bad diet okay
if you ever look at how many calories
you burn per hour of running or whatever
and you look at the labels of like
typical snack cakes you're like what the
fuck
i can eat one and a half of these
fucking debbie brownie whatever fucking
am i legally allowed to say hostess
cakes they're too big to sue me right
ooh famous last words so you know little
debbie's like apes
you're like what little debbie aren't
you supposed to smooth your pants just
shut the fuck up check out these
brownies i got you're like oh shit girl
you take the brownies and all of a
sudden you're like oh my fuck i just
pissed away 600 calories on those
brownies it's fucking insane
a lot of people folks and i know a lot
of you are super educated in this
in this field and to you it's like an
eye roll why people do this
so many fucking people don't really pay
attention to their diet
and they do hours of cardio and they're
fucking baffled as to why they can't
lose the weight they want to lose
you gotta get your diet sorted i would
say you got to get your diet sorted
before you can fucking start worrying
about cardio
sort out your diet make sure it's mostly
healthy foods
control your portions we have tons of
other stuff on this channel as to how to
do that
and then layer in the cardio because if
you get your if you get your diet right
layering in the cardio you fucking piss
away body weight like you wouldn't
believe
oh my fucking god i'm like that guy from
that movie thinner i'm fucking
disappearing
it was trippy movie right give that some
thought in the comments so
uh if that's the case you're golden but
if you haven't sorted your diet
even with the portion stuff because like
you're like nuts nuts are healthy you
can
put away 2 000 calories and nuts in a
fucking blink of an eye
even my blink of an eye fucking occurs
all the goddamn time right
so it's super easy to get carried away
diet control first
not like rigid control but just don't do
anything crazy mostly healthy foods know
your portions
if you want to do formal counting macros
use the rp diet app totally cool
then lay your cardio don't think that
you can do a shit load of cardio
and it doesn't matter what i eat because
you'll hear shit like that from runners
they're like well i do so much cardio i
can eat whatever and i've seen
a friend of mine who's a runner who's a
nationally ranked 5 000 10 000
meter runner he showed up to a party
with a sleeve of like hostess cupcakes
there's like 12 of them shits in there
he just ate
them throughout the party i was like
dude what the fuck he was like six one
155 pounds ripped to shreds and never
gained a bit of body fat but
for him that works because he does so
much cardio it's basically a fucking day
job
you if you're using cardio to lose
weight probably can't physically do that
much cardio because your body would
break down you're just not that good of
shape i sure as hell not
watch your diet first then think about
cardio because you can't out cardio a
bad diet
if you're really interested in the best
health and the best appearance
try to train with weights at least twice
a week do whole body weight training
twice a week with a sensible program we
have a ton of resources here on how to
do that
if you do that you're going to diet down
all the weight you want to diet down
through multiple phases of that
12 weeks at a time 10 still applies
right
if you do that you'll end up with like a
really awesome lean physique versus
being like
like cocaine model thin not like oh
you're a model people are like oh you're
a model i heard the industry's real
tough
as is clearly evident by your physique
right you don't want to end up like
willem dafoe thin or some shit like that
just his face his body is pretty cool
you wanna probably lift weights it's
healthy
supports bone structure and it gives you
a better shape at the end of it all and
more capable you don't want to lose a
bunch of weight
and to be so fucking skinny or weak
people are like let me get this box for
you you're clearly pathetic
you want to have some muscle cereal a
fucking functional adult right maybe
even more than functional adult
so definitely if your goal and a lot of
people again why am i saying this shit
tons of people do it they're like i lose
weight
i know thermodynamics fuck loads of
cardio very little food
it works you lose a lot of weight at the
end of the day you lose a bunch of
muscle too you might not look as good
as you want and you sure as hell won't
feel as good as you want and
of course same weight goal and diet
break strategy
as above so no more than 10 at a time
take nice long diet breaks to really
heal everything up
before you try it again oh
boy can i talk huh if you like more of
my talking
see you next time for the next video
you
