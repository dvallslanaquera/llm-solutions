press
go don't you nobody said I'm sorry I
accept your apology thank you I would
instead prefer five more reps so you
don't have to be sorry anymore grab the
handle you're alternating between Father
Figure and father figure that's not nice
to you yes shitty older brother all
right same idea ready slow
[Music]
hey folks
I'm Dr Mike
for Renaissance periodization this is
Adam regusia he has a mega cooking
YouTube channel
where he actually Cooks actual food and
he's actually good at it unlike me who's
a French chef trained in France you know
this Continental Cuisine but I'm no good
at anything especially cooking however
I'm okay at making people oh let's say
suffer
colloquial term through resistance
training Gotta Sing for your supper
right you know things have to happen
part one right now Adam is going to be
getting beat up by me in a full body
workout first time on this channel maybe
look at how ready he is one could say
he's ready I
after this
um Adam will push me through the paces
so to speak in the kitchen and we'll
learn how to make a fun recipe that
won't taste like shit because those are
the only kind I can come up with
how are you feeling are you ready to
train
I must break you and you will try right
now
we're gonna warm you up first then we
are going to do a technique a tactic a
strategy so to speak
that works really well for whole body
workouts and that is when we take one
exercise that usually hits quite a few
muscles and we superset it with another
exercise that uses pretty much none of
those same muscles so while you push
yourself super hard in your hamstrings
and glutes and lower back here on the
stiff legged deadlift in a bit we're
going to superset that to chest presses
which means as soon as it runs to flag
of deadlifting you calmly walk over to
the chest press begin to do lots of
those as soon as you're done there maybe
30 seconds rest you come back and hit
this again we're going to do that like
three or four times in a row let you
rest and it will pick another exercise
combo to hit other parts of your body
unrelated Parts after four or five of
these little superset situations your
whole body will be trained fried cooked
so to speak see you could relate to that
ready to serve Scott the camera guy is
way fitter than me I don't like that
can we get somebody else this makes me
uncomfortable Scott wear a fat suit this
is where we flipped the script okay and
we turn the attitude from a leisurely
tone into a business has to get done
okay
no I didn't touch it
chest slow
up three and as if you're gonna do
another Ultra slow and then put the bar
down
beautiful come with me
it's low controlled full touch
that was a bounce no more bouncing do it
again slow pause
go good couple more you got this we're
supposed to be working hard
quality reps only go go go go go go go
go go go go go go go go go go go slow as
if another chest up slow
all the way down touch get out oh yeah
yeah no that was it that was okay well I
heard like a few years ago everybody was
saying oh it's all about the eccentric
it's all about the way back down that
actually builds your muscle way more
than pushing but now I feel like the I
don't people hear people saying that as
often anymore has the research kind of
turned the other direction no no The
Eccentric is importantly like a 60 40
we're at 60 eccentric is good 40
concentric is good but uh so it's not
the end of the world but also I think
maybe the people just go through phases
in exercise science where they like like
to talk about something but then when
they feel like they've been heard they
go on to another thing what's the thing
now where the people are talking about
post in the comments what's the big
thing now yeah what's what's glutes
what's the
glutes have always been huge in my world
well and they are huge in your world and
I've noticed let's go make them bigger
good three more and you're done here
chest chest
one butt back yes
two knees back more butt back and knees
back yes up as if another big chest slow
okay now we're working oh yeah a couple
more all day Adam all day big chest good

yeah we'll give you a drink okay have
you rest and then we'll do our next
great sounds good yes okay
the next superset is going to be leg
press with pull down not really any
muscles involved in those two and it
makes for a great trade-off this is
going to be fun because leg presses are
so fun the pull Downs kind of work as
hitting your back and a bit of a break
we're going to do another three sets of
this and then we'll have one final shall
I say it now I'll say it triple superset
spooky we're actually filming this the
day after Halloween so we've got six
exercises don't you worry about how many
three times two I'm no doctor but I know
what three times two is based on your
math I can tell you're no doctor it's
like that Ronnie Coleman video where

I don't like either of you
either
[Music]
take that YouTuber
cook your way out of that one
motherfucker
foreign
say no cooldowns either can we cool down
we just don't stretch cooldowns are
something you can do if you would like
to be less sore no I don't know I like
I'm enough of a masochist I like this I
like me some Doms yeah
but also it probably reduces adaptations
so cooldowns are inadvisable I knew that
Dr Mike was going to harm me in some way
but you know if you were to like say
like point on the doll where Dr Mike is
going to hurt you
I would not have guessed the particular
places okay
you're not going to be helpful in the
police interview
[Music]
I just I thought you were gonna throw
more weight at me I was like baby weight
but it was
I don't like how it made me feel I think
you did great thank you you feel
I feel wrecked excellent that's crazy
yeah and I thought that I had been like
because I was like super totally out of
shape for several years and then like
about eight months ago I started kind of
ratcheting it back up again
and I thought I was being hard on myself
but no
that shit was hard dude you did really
good you tried hard you maintained your
Technique you bitched a an acceptable
amount oh thank you yes there's
definitely a buffer zone and uh it's
just for the cameras and then now we go
and we
we make tasty food no no I don't promise
the T Words yes we make things gainful
food that lead to gains and we'll see
you in the kitchen as of
so yeah we're gonna we're gonna we're
gonna refuel ourselves
and I'm gonna show you a recipe that I
used to make a lot back when I took my
fitness much more seriously or the other
way of looking at is that I had no
children and therefore I had nothing
more important to do
um but it's something I haven't made in
a while but it's a it's a turkey
meatloaf mini meatloaf that you do in
like a muffin tin and it's fucking gross
but uh you know it'll make you look like
this guy hey and hilariously enough they
used to call me mini meatloaf in high
school let's get in there and buy some
stuff in my opinion asparagus is the
king of vegetables and that's not just
because it's shaped like a phallus
um but mostly but mostly because it's
shaped like a phallus but also it's very
delicious and nutritious and it makes
your pee smell real weird unless you're
one of the like 30 of people who don't
have that Gene and you know the people
who have that Gene their piece still
smells weird they just don't know it oh
that's the worst I know or is it the
best is that like the better way to be
so the bodybuilders always want me to
talk about they want to say how can I
make my chicken breasts taste better
my response buy the thighs now they
don't distinguish between
dark meat and white Meats
my wife and I will not be able to eat
them unless you make them disgustingly
lean okay so 93 7 probably all right
we'll do it although there is like 99
but that's not really food anymore is it
good you might as well just inject amino
acids how is that even possible yeah you
want to make anything taste good the
shortest way there is chipotle peppers
in Adobo sauce dump it in anything is
good so the question is like traditional
Quaker Oats versus instant oats my
understanding is that the processing
they do for the instant oats their
starch damage which raises the glycemic
index considerably
um on the other hand if you're like
a specimen such as yourself you want all
that sugar to hit you really fast right
I don't know let's go with the
traditional okay
let's get a muffin tin and then let's go
to the kitchen
so this is something I used to eat all
the time when I was much fitter than I
am now and it's totally disgusting
you're gonna hate it so uh Step One is
take any vegetable that you like I like
asparagus because I think it tastes good
also it's
um it's small and so it Cooks quickly
so uh the uh the trick for you kids at
home is to uh it comes in a bundle like
like Yay uh is uh remove this remove
this uh oh somewhere that was cool yeah
remove this uh uh whatever the what is
the rubber band rubber band there I
suffer from Aphasia so uh and then don't
remove that one because like basically
once it gets down here you got
um you've got a whole bunch of the like
organic polysaccharides are converting
into uh lignin which is the stuff that
makes wood wood
um and like the you know the older that
the asparagus is then the more Woody the
stems are going to be so basically I
just like leave that on because it holds
that part together and then you can
throw it away more easily we don't want
the Woody stuff I well you want you want
the you want
can't box with this guy he's too good I
am merely going to cut this into teeny
pieces to make it as small as possible
so that you don't notice it as you cram
it down your gullets are we still
talking about the vegetables look at the
entries if there's one thing dogs love
it's asparagus I have generally even you
know in times when I was like eating
like a meathead like Dr Mike I have
endeavored to eat lots of vegetables
just because I always feel way less
terrible yeah it's very good for your
health you know purely for the fiber uh
if nothing else you know so we'll just
let that soften I'm good at that part
how do you know when that's done
it's done okay trade secret then yeah
I mean the other thing about vegetables
is that it's like they
in all seriousness it's like
the cellular Decay that they experience
even after you take them off the heat is
really significant like they keep
softening yeah yeah you know so always
pull your vegetables well before they
are as soft as you want so once you pull
out you continue to go softer now here's
the thing I don't actually want to cook
this yet like I want it to
because if I if I cook it too soon the
whole loaf won't set in a disgusting
little bowling ball that you can take to
work with you right
um so you know I've turned the heat off
and now I'm going to basically just
overwhelm this pan with way more mass
than it could possibly cook if it wanted
to
um and at the same time what I'm doing
is like cooling down the vegetables so
that like
I can handle them and I can toss this
all together and turn it into repulsive
little meatballs it's all about
efficiency here I love the name
repulsive little meatballs again another
High School nickname of mine all right
so if we're like eyeballing macros how
many oats you figure we want in here Dr
Mike
issue here at this point
I'll get in with my hand it'll be fine I
mean yeah that's good yeah all right
that's good Dr Mike has problems with
peppers so we're only gonna put in the
Adobo sauce
but that's fine like all the flavor is
in the Adobo sauce
sprinkles salt
what's this badge no that's crazy I've
never used the spout feature oh okay
yeah good there's a lot of fucking food
here
delicately massage this God I would
never do this it feels so good doesn't
it
oh yeah
all righty there's a complete meal right
there where's that muffin tin
there you go and it's not it's not a
real muffin so you don't have to worry
about it Rising
um so yeah you just you just build that
sucker up as much as you want throw that
fucker in the oven and we'll see what
happens are you sure you want me to do
this come on just throw it in the oven
you can do that can't you uh well let's
find out no okay I can't because there
are at least four distinct choices of
where to throw just put it on the bottom
one there's room
[Music]
you won't know that they're done because
they look good because they won't look
good uh you're going to want to use a
thermometer and uh so I would say go
ahead and do a whole 160 fahrenheit on
these suckers so yeah you wrap that
sucker in aluminum foil take it to the
work fridge throw it at somebody and
throw it at somebody and at least you're
not that guy like reheating fish in the
work fridge you know nobody likes that
guy no nobody liked me um and these
honestly like in all seriousness they
actually are pretty good cold
see
now too much salt but
that's not bad actually
you have to eat it I don't oh he doesn't
okay poor guy
poor guy well do you have bon appetit
poor bodybuilder
um oh God
yeah it's a taste of games my friend
folks I'm not cut out for the kitchen oh
me I'm cut out for
an artistic place of preparing food this
man is he's got his own YouTube channel
that's 10 times bigger than ours where
he does cooking he talks about food
science it's funny it's fun it's
educational you have to learn how to
actually make food that doesn't taste
like shit and you get to learn some food
science as well check him out
his shit is going to be right here if
Scott the video guy remembers to put it
there all here and links in the
description dude thank you so much for
coming down my pleasure if you start
noticing that I'm more jacked in future
videos this is the guy you think
I'm gonna think of the pain he caused me
I'm gonna try to cause myself yes how
would Dr Mike hurt me today replicate
the pain I will replicate that folks
it's been real it's been fun see you
later yeah
[Music]
