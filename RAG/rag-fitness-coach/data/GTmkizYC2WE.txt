hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization strength training made
simple number ten
when and how should you deload during
strength training
so first up maybe we don't need to
deload
all the time there is a situation which
you can use a simpler approach
just for one session at a time if you go
a little bit too far with the fatigue
in that session or for that movement
pattern like for your squat
just your squatter just your deadlift or
just your bench so on and so forth so
from the strength training made simples
last video number nine on progression
every week you add some weight and you
keep reps the same
and you keep sets the same or add them
but generally roughly the same so
going up in weight going up in weight
that gets tough at some point
at some point from that process a
two-part process
just training that hard all the time and
going harder and harder every single
time
the cumulative fatigue will start to get
pretty crazy and you just won't be able
to beat your prior performance anymore
your performance is going to plateau and
even dip down a little bit you're going
to show up one day
and have a bad session which you just
don't hate your plan numbers sometimes
not even close
what do you do well if the rest of your
body feels fine like if this happens on
the bench press
and as we adjust your pushing muscles
that are feeling it systemically you
feel fine like you feel okay your legs
feel recovered you had a great squat
workout yesterday
so on and so forth maybe you don't need
to just take a whole week and deload or
it might be like week three
of a six week progression you're like
i'm not just gonna deload it's just a
problem
for this particular session so here's
what you do since your fatigue in that
session is really high and it probably
accumulated a bit too fast
you got to deal with it somehow what
you're going to do first finish that
session strong
just try to do your best and if it's
really high rpe that's okay just try to
kill it as much as possible
now for the next session of that
muscle group and that movement pattern
so for example if you
train pushing muscles monday and
thursday and your monday didn't go so
hot
finish as strong as you can on monday
then on thursday what you do is you come
in
and you do all the plan sets all the
planned reps you were gonna do
but at one half of the planned weight so
if you had five sets of bench
for sets of five and a hundred pounds
now you do five by five
at fifty pounds what that's super easy
that's the whole point
it brings your fatigue down like crazy
while letting you
work a lot on technique and actually
technical work tends to recover you
sometimes
even better than complete rest what
you'll do is
that session will be super easy and all
the assistance work too you do the same
thing the whole session is easy you
don't want to make up for it on
really hard assistance works if you
finish your benches now you have
dumbbell press usually it sets at eight
okay it's still set to eight but instead
of 50 pound dumbbells now it's 25 pound
dumbbells i know super crazy super easy
the cool thing is you'll be super
recovered after that session the
next session you have which is saying
next monday you do the same number of
planned sets
on reps and weight as you were anyway
because that fatigue is going to be
lower it's probably going to be a great
workout
and then you're back to normal you've
brought the fatigue under control at
least for the next couple of weeks
usually
and you just progress as normal from
there all the sessions and the weeks
after are totally fine
now that can work a few times however
after about three to six weeks on
average if you're training hard with
appropriate volumes and intensities
you're gonna get into a situation where
multiple movement patterns
you're pushing and you're pulling and
you're squatting
and your vertical pulling so on and so
forth they're gonna have needed recovery
sessions you may have already taken them
and you'll get into a situation
in which your whole mind and body system
is just feeling beat up you guys know
what i'm talking about like you wake up
in the morning
for your deadlift workout and you're
like there's parts of you sore you
didn't even think
could be sore and just as far as
motivation to train an overall burden of
the training process you're like holy
crap
i am beat up there's nothing wrong with
that perfectly predictable
actually means you're doing a good job
pushing the pace when that happens
one thing is your a lot of your rpes are
going to be crazy high in order to
continue to progress which means
put a little bit more weight on the bar
and still hit the target reps
your ratings of perceived exertion are
going to be like nines and tens where
they maybe you were hoping for eights
and nines they're just gonna be at the
peak limit
you're gonna be hanging on by a thread
and sometimes even underperforming
right so you show up to the gym you had
uh you know let's say a big deadlift
workout big squat work
squat workout big bench workout and all
three of them went straight to hell
you're done and it's not a recovery
session done you need a lot you've
accumulated a lot of fatigue
you've got to bring it down big time so
what do you do
for one whole week fresh in a week so if
you start to
flutter and things start to go bad and
you know you need to deal a week finish
that current week
strong grind it i know it sucks but you
signed up for this
the next week what you do is for the
first half of that week you do the same
plan sets and reps as usual but
with only 70 percent of the planned
weight right
of last week's weight so if you did you
know
a hundred pounds last week for sets of
five now you're doing 70 pounds
still pretty tough but it's definitely
not at that point where it's
accumulating any more fatigue and some
of the fatigue starts to fall
still decent training but really not
cumulative anymore
fatigue is starting to fall now in the
second half of the week
you're going to go from the same setup
same sets and same reps as your planned
but you're going to drop the load to 50
of what normally is exactly like the
recovery sessions so now you have
half a week of pretty easy sessions not
quite recovery but 70
and then the last half of the week is
all recovery sessions i mean there might
be like
two or three recovery sessions in a row
for everything
and at that point you are going to be so
ready to train
so healed so fatigue reduced towards the
end it's going to be like man you're
going to come into friday workout you're
like i want to smash it i want to smash
it don't
rest wait take saturday off sunday off
next monday
you'll be able to get back into a fresh
new mesocycle of progression
start putting more weight on the bar and
slowly move up and repeat the process
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
time for the next video
