hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization is locking out your joints
safe during weight training
let's give it a little bit of thought
all right so what are some observations
people say shit like bro don't luck out
on
leg press duh hack squat for sure
dumbbell press yep anything doesn't
matter what you lock out on if you post
a video on youtube or instagram or
snapchat or
chatterbait
hope we don't get flagged for that one
uh it doesn't matter someone's going to
come on and tell you you're locking out
and that's hurting the environment al
gore is sad the seals are dying and the
world is going to end and you're immoral
and you're going to die
surprisingly you're not dead yet
and locking out is really bad you're not
supposed to lock out any stuff but the
question arises as to why
not so
some facts hopefully facts
every single joint
that locks out
was drumroll designed by the process of
evolution
to lock out
there's no punch line with that it's
just actually designed to do that it's
not locked out by accident okay
there is definitely no evidence and not
even any rationale that locking out in
normal training will lead to long-term
wear and tear
it just doesn't make any sense you talk
to your average orthopedic specialist
that actually works with athletes and
it's familiarity with training
and you say hey like can i lock out my
like handstand push-ups when i'm a
gymnast they're going to be like
what
like can i do a push-up and actually
lock out i'm going to say
oh yeah yeah
what why does it hurt and you'll say
well no
he's not going to be like well
just just you wait yeah that's not the
highest professional who's who's in the
right doesn't say stuff like that it's
actually just what you're supposed to do
now here's the thing
if it really bothers your joints to lock
out on a specific movement or specific
lift
don't do it okay don't do stuff that
repeatedly hurts
but if it doesn't hurt rock out and lock
out to your heart's content
interestingly if you do lock out over
time it's actually likely to make you
better at lockouts and probably make
your joints stronger
because if you avoid all things that
have even some semblance of risk you
become really fragile and frail and a
wuss and
hashtag all wolves and no sheep i don't
know i'm trying to fit in was that the
thing people say
all right okay fine fine locking out is
healthy over the long term but what
about acute injury risk
what about the following question won't
locking out as the kids say snap your
shit up
yes
if you fall into a very small category
of people
that one lady
you've seen her video on youtube if you
haven't don't watch it
because it's going to disturb living
shit out of you if you have you know
what i'm talking about with that
disturbing shady thing and i know you're
still going to go watch it because
you're like oh whatever it's not going
to disturb me and it's still fucking
haunt your dreams
if you're that lady then you probably
have a highly unusually lacks joints
and
that is a thing that is probably a
congenital condition and most people
just can't do
so
if you're that person
my apologies if you're actually that
person terrible accident but if you have
some kind of condition with really crazy
lacks joints locking out may not be a
good idea something to talk about with
your doctor
or those like two guys on uh youtube
that tried to like press like 2 000
pounds which seemingly like 1700 pounds
more than they could actually leg press
with a full range of motion and they did
it by pushing down on their knees
towards lockout with knee wraps arms
first of all the knee wraps auto
straighten your legs anyway the pushing
literally pushes your knees back the
other way and knee wraps bonus thing if
you've never done equip power lifting
they completely numb your lower body to
any sensations you actually lose almost
all proprioception you don't know if
your knees like this or if your knees
like that you just push especially after
a hard set and then your knees could
fold through you need to push pretty
hard you'd have a weight on there this
thing as much as a fucking car
not your three four or 500 pounds that
you're supposed to be leg pressing with
so if you do the shit properly to begin
with
then
[Music]
shit goes wrong some of you folks that
are uh do the pew pew thing you shoot
for sport or something like that uh you
know people say like well guns are
really dangerous they can get you killed
you gotta really fuck up with a gun to
have it get you killed are you really
really dumb shit so people who are like
intelligent pro gun advocates they know
that when people say guns are really
dangerous they can get you killed just
by accidentally just shoot yourself you
gotta go really out of your way and the
people that get hurt in the gym through
locking out have almost always gone
unbelievably out of their way to
something so morbidly stupid that i
don't know i don't want to say they had
it coming but they had it coming
so
yes if you're those three people we've
got so far yeah sure i'm missing a few
ten people
no you don't have to worry about acute
injury risk from locking out if you
don't have a congenital joint laxity
disorder which you probably don't
if you're using an appropriate load you
can actually handle through a full range
of motion
and if you're not snapping into the
lockout in a velocity you're not used to
you're not well controlling the weight
and you're just doing it with reckless
abandon if you're locking out at a
normal speed or one which you're used to
which could appear quite fast to the
naked eye
then you're totally fine right how many
times have you seen someone pull a bicep
or tear a pack or strain a quad in the
gym you might have seen a few of those
things even those are really rare how
many times have you ever seen someone
completely hyper extend a joint in front
of you
maybe never right mind you
equipped power lifters who have knee
wraps on who have a suit who's
completely annulled to any sensation of
their bodies
they have torn quads torn glutes i know
it's crazy torn adductors everything in
the in the books squatting 1200 pounds
and more
almost no one perhaps no one ever really
like that one guy has ever actually
hyper-extended their knee and folded
back the other way it's incredibly rare
even at loads that you're not even
supposed to be doing as you're a human
being with your own body so people like
that almost never get hurt in that way
with super crazy hyper extension you're
probably safe unless you're going out of
your way to do dumb shit so don't do
dumb shit
now
third problem with locking out okay fine
it doesn't cause long-term injuries
maybe the acute injury risk is wildly
overstated you have to go out of your
way to earn it what about keeping
constant tension on the muscle right
maybe it's not unsafe but is it less
effective it's going all the way almost
to lockout more effective than locking
out because constant tension
can
without resting at lockouts produce uh
more metabolites more muscle activation
and sequester more metabolites in the
muscle basically it doesn't give a
chance for the burn to go away and the
burn is somewhat hypertrophic so there
is something there it can enhance
hypertrophy if you don't lock out right
but
if you rest between reps
technically speaking you're faster more
growth prone fibers your fastest twitch
fibers
they get much more value out of rest
than the slower twitch ones so slower
twitch ones don't grow much anyway or
grow as much
they are endurance fibers they can keep
going they don't need rest right
but every time you lock out and rest for
a little bit your faster fibers get more
recovered and they can really benefit
from that
this locking out in between reps can
actually allow you to do more reps per
set not fewer
it lets you flirt with failure for more
reps
and the area under the curve of how much
total metabolite you sum can actually be
higher this way than just doing one set
and never locking out the entire time it
also lets you capitalize on the end
ranges of motion that you could be
skipping without locking weights out
which grows a little bit of extra muscle
just because it engages parts of that
muscle that might not be engaged a ton
if you're going short on the range of
motion
and thus
at least as good of results can be seen
with full lockouts including several
seconds of rest at each lockout or every
now and again then with constant tension
so constant attention is one of those
things that people just say
constant attention constitution do you
want constitution right hey world
constitution you got phone calls tension
in there what it's a cool thing it works
but non-constant tension works as well
in some cases even better so you're not
losing anything you're not losing
anything at all
you can be free to do with roughly
similar effect
all constant tension lifts that's
totally fine
all full lockout sets every single rep
is locked down and you can even take
half a second between each rep
you can do a set of mini constant
tension reps and then lock out to rest
and then mini constant tension and a
lockout to rest and if you like that
those can be done by a rep style that's
totally fine super effective whatever
you do make sure you're consistent
within the meso cycle so if like week
one for leg press you do constant
tension and you just get like ten eight
six don't next week do like some my rep
breaks because you can get like 18
17 16 reps and you're like oh my god i
got so much stronger no you're resting
longer so whatever kind of rest you
choose whether it's full lockouts uh
full constant tension or some
combination of both make sure it's the
same week to week to week so you can
track your strength better make sure
you're not inappropriately jacking up
volume or load or anything like that so
final recommendations
if you don't like to lock out if none of
this was convincing you don't have to
lock out you're missing out on probably
no gains if any gains at all
and if you're missing out any gains at
all
you need a tiny super theoretical amount
of gains so don't have to lock out no
big deal
if you don't have any good reason not to
lock out and hopefully i've presented a
few
keep locking out to your heart's content
the last thing i'll say
is
if i ever see you in a gym and you lock
out and you hyper extend your both of
your elbows and your upper arm or your
lower arm bones shoot into your skull
and fucking bust into your eyes and you
can't see and now you have stubs for
arms and and and your hands and fucking
forearms are coming out of your eyes oh
my god
i'm gonna be there and it would be like
it's because you watch my video i
fucking lie to you
i told you when snappy shit up but you
did i got you a motherfucker i got you
i'm gonna whisper that shit in your ear
what kind of 5d chest is he playing
60 chess see you next time
you
