if you're training something like biceps
and back it's not true to say that back
has to go first just because it's the
biggest muscle it may be very well that
your biceps are absolutely your primary
priority and back is secondary if that's
really the case yes you should probably
train your biceps early if not first in
your plan and you can use movements for
the back like lat prayers and some
variations of pull Downs that don't tax
your biceps as heavily and can still be
effective for you after you train your
biceps so the idea that larger muscles
should be trained before smaller muscles
is not a categorically true statement
