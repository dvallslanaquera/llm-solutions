oh my god
oh fouled another one
hey folks doctor mike isil here for
renaissance periodization and guess what
maddie mad dog for berg is here
to try her hand at full rom hypertrophy
training mistake number one
mistake number two is she's repping the
shirt hey got it and she's going to have
to
suffer adequately and do her very very
best
here's what's on the agenda lying leg
curls
first sets of 10 to 20 reps probably
some maya wraps are in there
then we are going to do the pendulum
squat which is a really awesome piece of
equipment
here at the dragon's lair in las vegas
nevada
which is owned by flex lewis who
brother you're married married too okay
i was gonna say engage that would have
been a football
congratulations thank you um and then
after the pendulum squat she is going to
do some probably lunge to squat super
sets
and a massive massive mega leg workout
any final words before your imminent
demise um
our curse words alone yeah elsewhere oh
god yes
get ready for that boom let's do it
[Music]
lying leg colors up first full range of
motion of course
control eccentric and a little bit of a
hold on a peek contraction
we'll probably get rid of that and just
do sort of one little quick pause
slow quick pause slow sets of 10 to 20
reps
the first set is going to be straight
sets two plus
and we'll figure out how many she's
going to do based on her perception of
effort
pump etc degree of weakness in the
hamstrings but
all the sets after the first are going
to be mile rep sets we're going to try
to match the total number of reps we got
in the first one or close
by doing as many as we can almost a
failure and then adding a few adding a
few adding a few
with a couple sets a couple of seconds
rest in between
so that's the deal it's a top way of
training it's effective
if you're just into it don't do a ton of
these because it can really really mess
you up
but the goal today is to get messed up
so let's get it done
16 patrol one last one
[Music]
good that's it
very good you're not going to get 17 in
a first try
you're going to get like probably 10 to
12. i'll tell you to rest
you just sit in that very position at
the bottom when i say go again we'll do
more and more until we get to 17. sounds
good
eight two more ah
nine one more up
ten good effort relax rest don't go
anywhere
breathe twelve wonderful let's go
13 one more one more and then we rest go
go go slow breathe that's 14
rest relax two good technique
one way to control it
up two control
slow rest
[Music]
one and done go yes
slow slow slow slow and the gentlest
touch ever
[Music]
beautiful relax rest that's it good
stuff
thank you good stuff
fuck scott she's actually gonna enjoy
all this i know you guys say partial
reps don't count
but a lot of people in bodybuilding i
see them do like forced
things like that is there a time and
place for that yeah probably a pretty
limited time and place
and i think it's one of those things
that once you have mastered the full
range of motion
then you can move on to very advanced
uses of partial range of motion
but a lot of the times you watch the
average bodybuilder train with partials
you say hey why are you doing partials
they have no good answers uh well cause
you know like
mind muscle and you shut the fuck up
okay and the fundamental reason why
most you also notice there's a
difference in female bodybuilders and
male bodybuilders
most female bodybuilders train with
beautiful technique and full range of
motion why
because females are fucking less
egotistical they just do what it takes
a lot of times for men let's be honest
they come in here and they're like
you know they want to impress themselves
other men mostly they want to fucking
slide six plates on the fucking hat
squat
and do whatever bullshit because they're
like i'm fucking strong your muscles
don't give a fuck how many plates are on
there
they care about stimulus full range of
motion is the best way
in most cases not all to stimulate the
muscle with the lowest chance of injury
but it blows dick like i would rather do
partials because it's easier
but like the shit opens you up and
closes you like a fucking accordion that
sucks
but you benefit and in your case having
a great time yeah speaking of what
you're ready to go again
seven i love the control
[Music]
eight nine
keep it good keep it good ten more
more up eleven one more
gentle touch uh strong oh we're not
counting that rest rest rest
good that's eleven that's 11. rest relax
breathe let's get three or four here
let's go 12 perfect
13. good way to curl it up
14 very good so you guys will notice
that on some of her harder reps
maddy's actually lifting her knees and
her thighs
off of the platform that's 100 fine
what that does is it actually allows the
hamstring to contract even further
yes the lumbar spine is involved in
creating that motion but it's not in an
unsafe position
so there's nothing wrong with getting
into that place to get more reps
slow slow slow slow
done gorgeous relax a bit
very good stuff very good stuff when do
you need to be healed by when's your
next planned leg workout
technically tomorrow okay we're done
here okay let's go
let's go to a pendulum spot
maddie still looks happy this is a
problem for us god dammit
she's supposed to look miserable but
apparently she likes to suffer so it's
just going to be a real happy video
we're going to overlay clowns dubs
balloons
children's birthday parties all the
happy things good news more happiness is
the pendulum squat manufactured by
arsenal
this is a gnarly gnarly gnarly machine
let's see how maddie stacks up i was
hoping that this machine would be taken
and that mike would have to change the
game plan but oh yes looks like no one
else wants to face it
we slid the guy a hundred dollars and
we're like sir
please let's get it done we are gonna do
oh three or four sets of maya reps
10 to 20 which means she might be able
to get something like 10 reps on a first
mini set
she's gonna lock out rest and breathe
for a few seconds crush it again until
we get roughly to 20 or so
tough amazing way to train not for every
day not for every session
but every now and again a few months of
cycles it works really well let's get it
done
if you really feel like you're fucking
done wreck but let's get after it
nothing ever sacrifices technique a rep
only counts if you sit for a second at
the bottom
and everything is slow controlled cool
let's do it
up four keep it up
control control up
five again control control
up six one more go control
effort effort
rest breathe that's seven
well on your way
three control
we're not just getting through shit
we're working it up good
no rest down there just a tiny pause and
then back at it
up yes one more slow
up go go go
rest breathe we're not done that's 10
total
we are not getting off this machine
until we get 15 fucking reps
let's go manny time to really enjoy it
two reps here
up one good technique
slow strength go
up up up up breathe that's two
let's take these one at a time rest a
couple more seconds
breathe it out

i've got you just in case one good one
go up
nobody's helping you nobody's helping
you rack
good stuff good stuff
that was awesome and she wilts like a
dying flower
one more set we're all done here i was
actually pretty scared
of meeting you why just because you
you seem so intimidating but okay hold
on let me try it
very good set it up take your time
we're gonna do four or five reps first
up that's four one more control it
or we won't count them yes
up go rest breathe
that's five two
control only good reps today only good
reps
up good again
slow slow slow

i'm right here with you into your
goddamn best
move up up up up

we need two more singles two more
singles
whenever you're ready it's on your time
slow
up good one more
whenever you're ready
up go go go go
rack excellent
excellent excellent work oh
fuck me
whenever you're ready we're gonna go do
lunges over there i'm gonna set it up
for you take your time okay
last exercise of the day lunge to squat
superset of course
multiple lunges with dumbbells technique
is everything here we're going to stay
super upright take nice long steps the
gentlest
tiniest babiest little touch of the knee
to the ground no slamming
when maddie is nice and done with lunges
we're going to have her put the
dumbbells down
take a nice squat stance she's going to
put her hands up
and she's going to do slow controlled
eccentric squats until she can't
and we'll repeat that for a few sets
really great training strategy
how are you feeling
for you oh thanks so much i'm feeling
ruined i'm feeling all the muscles
my toenails are sweating that's good
right
anyway let's get to it oh hop right away
no brakes
slow hop right away no brakes
slow up turn last lap last lap get that
shit done
let's go slow up
stay upright up
stay upright that was bullshit
do it again go slow
better good on this side too
slow up good
slow up big chest
slow up drop the dumbbells
up three slow
[Music]
up four down up
down that's six keep going
seven slow go go go go go
eight slow slow slow up nine
slow we gotta get 12 up two more let's
go
and up and one last one deep deep
up rest
all right actually
maddie's almost broken you don't you
don't have to get up she's really
fucking strong
world-class power lifter so it makes
sense the 20s were
not enough too many reps in the lunges
outside of the proper loading range
and we had to do a super set with her
body weight she just kept going
she got tired but not super close to
failure we're fixing that
we got a barbell it's heavier she was
doing 40 pounds of
the lunges now it's 50. and
we're gonna have her keep the barbell on
her back to do squats with after
if this set goes well it'll be the last
one of the day because she's getting
pretty close to her film
sometimes you make adjustments on the
fly and that's totally cool as long as
two things one they're logical they're
rational
and two you're not making them to get
the fuck away from hard work
you're making them to get closer to hard
stimulative effective work
with a high degree of stimulus low
degree of fatigue this right here
it's a solution no one really asked for
but it's gonna fucking work
let's get it done up four
slow five great
let's make this one extra slow six
up turn to face the mirror
all the long way around bar very high in
your back i want your bar right here
shoulders back pull the shoulders back
good
hit it slow
that was bullshit that was a half rep
all the way down and sit
go sit up
one we got ten let's go sit
up two don't come up until i say go up
three down up
four down slow
up five down slow
yes up 60 up upright
go up seven
go up eight
slow slow god damn it chest stop
up nine last one he's very slow as fuck
let's go maddie let's end it a high note
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous chest up
sit don't go anywhere keep sitting keep
sitting
keep sitting keep sitting you're strong

everybody knows who charlie is he trains
super hard
all credit where it's due but my husband
and i always feel like he's faking it
after a set
like there's one hack spot video where
he gets up and he goes
oh yeah his whole body's shaking like
that's not real
that ain't right i learned i was humbled
today
well you humbled us as well amazing
