oh
hey guys so today was my first day back
in the gym after finishing up with my
dup
bench capacity phase i did go ahead and
test my bench
max after i finished the four week
program
and i managed to get 365 for a pause
and you can check my instagram for the
video of that
but today i decided to go ahead and work
with robin on
day one of her new training phase that
she just got from the strength guys
and it is a squat accumulation
uh phase so it's a six week
training program i didn't take a super
close look at it but
um it looks like i'm squatting uh
yeah i'm squatting pretty often like
three times a week and i'm
deadlifting twice a week and benching i
think
uh it looks like twice a week maybe
yeah so um here i'm doing day one
and this is 95 pounds and it was
pretty easy like it felt like an rp
maybe seven
i think the first set it always feels
the heaviest for me
so i look like i'm kind of struggling
but it was it was pretty easy it was
like an rp7 and should have been an 8.5
and this is my second set here and just
by the way this is my first time
doing low bar or well my second time i
did come in yesterday and
try it out but i just did 405 for a
single so
this is really my first time doing any
working sets with low bar
and my back feels pretty good i've
gotten to the point now where
i pretty much just have to accept that
it's going to be uncomfortable a little
bit
and as you can tell my form does look
pretty good and
i'm gonna be really careful with that
and make sure that it doesn't start to
break down and
i'm just using uh
a535 cream on my back to kind of
numb the paint a little bit for now but
a lot of it a lot of it yeah
um but the sets felt good and i feel
like my my form has
come a long way in spite of not really
squatting for a while simply from
just the extra reading watching prolific
squatters
uh in their videos and my
form i owe all to my last training phase
written by jason it was a squat
development phase
and i did a ton of box squats and pause
squats
until like he nailed it into my brain
how to squat properly
yeah that was awesome um i next i guess
i need to work on my
uh my walk out it's kind of not that
great
because the weed is really late i'm not
sure if this is the last step but on the
last that i did decide to go up to 105
because like i said the rpe was
around probably like a 7 7.5 and i
should have been doing 8.5
but i was using six my true sixty
percent took my one arm
so ronnie coleman making a cameo
appearance in the background
t-shirt but yeah i changed my spot up a
lot and i think when i was changing at
my spot
jeff decided to change up his as well
with a wider stance and sitting between
his legs more it seemed to help
oh for sure so here's the bench so after
that there's a couple of sets of bench
like acclimation sets where like pretty
much
um the weight was increased by five
percent each time
and that for like three sets and then
here the working sets
uh we went up to 70 percent
and i use seventy percent of 125 which i
haven't done but
seventy percent of 120 was way too easy
so
uh five sets of five paused
um yeah and then this you see my massive
london bridge arch uh i've been working
on my setup
a bit and i feel a lot more comfortable
with it now i feel like i've limited my
rom
quite a bit by getting my arch uh as
tight as it is now it's really solid
he used to have the problem with his
butt pop popping up off the bench like
fairly often it was kind of a a
recurring thing like when the weight got
really really heavy
but like now it's not at all it's like
cemented on there there's no way it's
coming up there's no room for movement
i'm just super tight on the bench now
um so here are banded push-ups like i
had
no idea what to use so i did one set
with these
weird like resistant accordion bands and
it came off
frustrating but it was supposed to be
four by eight
and here i am hugging jeff and then yeah
straddling
i thought that was pretty awkward
yeah we pretty much we're just playing
around like
it was just yeah for fun i guess
strong like push-up chest what do you
mean
what's wrong with that no i don't know
i'm touching my nose
and then here i am i think with a
10-pound cleat
it was pretty hard yeah no i'm just it's
just funny how
the workout kind of went downhill after
that yeah
well it's because we always get bored
after like spotting like
any of the big three like that's what we
want to do and then any of the accessory
movements we're just like
hey i guess i'll just get my way you're
supposed to be set to eight but it was
just
too easy yeah because
you like push your head neck and face
down to the ground to like
thank you oh i'm touching my nose to the
ground yeah because
all right guys thanks for watching
that's the end
