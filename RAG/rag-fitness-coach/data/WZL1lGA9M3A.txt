hey folks dr mike israetel here for
renaissance periodization
fat loss dieting made simple video
number nine
long-term fat loss and what we mean by
that is something a little different
than you may
think so last time we learned how to
execute
or set up and execute a fat loss diet
phase awesome we learned how to do a
maintenance
to keep that fat loss off and that's
really good
but what if the amount of fat you lost
in that phase and kept off in the
maintenance phase
isn't all you wanted to lose you wanted
to lose more because if it's all you
wanted to lose
you just continue to live in healthy
balance high level of physical activity
eat super healthy bit of junk here and
there if you start gaining a little bit
of weight ease up on the junk for a few
weeks
problem solved what if you want to lose
more especially much more
like your total goal when you started is
like 50 pounds
what if you are 200 pounds when you
started and you want to get to 150
eventually
what is the best way to go about that
because there's a lot of right answers
and a lot of wrong answers so the major
rule
in a long-term fat loss is that you
don't
really want to lose more than 10 percent
about 10 percent at a time of your body
weight in one fat loss phase
now i know our example from the last
video was like an extreme example but it
was 12
you can do that usually if you're really
good at losing fat you've done it a
whole bunch before and it's just one
shot one kill one phase maintenance
you're done
that's totally fine the long view kind
of like um
if you have to get to 400 meters away
and maybe you have to catch a bus is 400
meters away you can half sprint to the
bus because you get to sit down
afterwards it's the last run you'll be
doing that day
but if you have a marathon distance you
have miles to go you don't have sprint
you jog okay same way here if you're 200
pounds and your goal is 190
just hit it if your goal is 180 hit it
if your goal is 150 you gotta dope it
out you gotta be easy
even that first phase shouldn't be much
more than ten percent
of your body weight and probably more
like six to eight i know that sucks
because each phase doesn't get you very
far
but getting far doesn't matter if you
try to get too far early and you
sabotage
your sort of long-term diet endurance
and you never make it to 150 pounds
but if you do the right things slow and
steady wins the race you guys have all
read that book about the story about the
rabbit versus the turtle or whatever
fucking tortoise and hair
it's the same idea right that's legit
stuff
it really does work so here we go a few
tips for
long-term fat loss first perform your
first fat loss phase
then the maintenance phase after it just
as described in all the other videos
next perform your second fat loss phase
only if you feel no diet fatigue at all
no low energy
no hunger no crazy cravings no
trepidation about starting a diet
you honestly in every part of you being
like dude i can rock this next diet
no problem then you're ready usually
that means
you're maintained for one time the
length of the glass diet so if you diet
it for 12 weeks that means you maintain
for 12 right there's no rush huge point
some people say like oh man eight weeks
in i'm ready remember when you try
dieting down
long-term fat loss for big amounts
usually if you're 200 pounds and you're
supposed to be 150 according to your own
preferences
you've been 200 for probably a long time
and it took you a long time to gain from
150 to 200. it's not going to happen
overnight and there's no bonus points
because remember if you
it's um here's a better analogy how
quickly do you move
through the woods at night with no
flashlight
you can run you can impale yourself on
some shit step on a skunk or some shit
like that trip over and die
so you wouldn't run you would go as
quickly as possible maybe there's a bad
guys chasing you
you go as quickly as you can but not any
faster than is safe because if you trip
and break your leg the bad guys are
catching up to you
so if you're running through the woods
at night with no flashlight you're not
running you're maybe jogging a little
bit maybe walking just moving around
making sure you're doing the right thing
just the same way as how long to
maintain when you're
really ready you're ready to go if you
think oh i can do this faster
you're essentially just starting to
sprint through a dark forest bad idea
bad idea because and also you're not the
first person to have that idea
hundreds of thousands and millions of
people before you had that idea and
almost all of them failed
so you know you're like oh man i can do
extra credit and instead of
you know seven week maintenance after my
seven week diet i can do six like yay
slow clap you did it you saved a week
don't do stuff like that
point number three each phase
successfully should have you losing less
weight than the last one in absolute
terms like how many pounds you lose
should be less
so you might lose 17 pounds in your
first 15 in your second
11 and your third and so on and so forth
why most people this shocks them because
they're used to like oh my god i can't
believe what's happening like in our
facebook clients group at renaissance
periodization on facebook
we have tons of people uh doing the you
know the diet and they're
using the app and all the stuff and
they're reporting the results there's an
awesome community we have
and a lot of the times we get the same
complaints so to speak or kind of
confusions like hey like
my last fat loss phase was easy i lost
15 pounds and this one i'm barely losing
11 and it's tough
why that's how it's supposed to be
because you're smaller now
11 pounds maybe the same fraction of
your body weight
as 15 pounds used to be when you were
bigger and also
as you get leaner your body fights you
harder
okay if you weigh 400 pounds to lose
from 400 to 375 is going to be the
easiest diet you'll ever do you just
literally stop eating potato chips with
every meal switch the potato chips and
soda with every other meal and ta-da
five weeks later you weigh you know 3.75
that's never going to happen again if
you
wear 400 at one point and you want to be
at 200 the diet from
210 or 215 to 200 will be the toughest
part of the plan
it has to be like that so know in
advance and plan
shorter less aggressive diets okay they
can be longer too but then the rate of
weight loss has to be lower
because your body fights you harder okay
so if you lost 10 on your first diet
you can try to lose 10 again in your
second diet but i would recommend
something like eight or nine and then
something like six or seven
and then something like five or six and
then voila you're done and the entire
time you did it right and never
failed to be on plan number four
if you feel burned out or not sure if
you want to tackle the next fat loss
phase at all or right now
don't don't do another phase until
you're 100 sure you're ready to go and
you're gonna break through those
plateaus
you can always just chill in healthy
balance
some junk mostly healthy eating a high
degree of physical activity watching
wait a bit
ups and downs and you're good to go you
can remain there for the rest of your
life so for example
if you wanted to lose from 200 to 150
and then towards like the 160s area
every time you drop lower you just feel
like total dog shit you can't even stand
it you're like oh
is it okay to stay 163 for a year
yes it is so much healthier than being a
200 and you're gonna
probably like your look so much better
and all this other stuff you may never
need to go to 150 because a lot of
people say i want to weigh 150
and they start training with weights and
they go from 200 to 163 and they have
abs and they're like
huh can't get much leaner than this
what the hell is 150 today even want
nothing we'll have a video next about
exotically leaning how to do that that's
a whole different animal
so if you get to a place where you don't
feel like dieting anymore losing fat
just eating healthy balance you're
totally good
and if you know you're gonna get there
eventually you can eat in healthy
balance for a long time
if someone used to be 400 pounds and
they got to 300 pounds and like oh
god i don't know how much longer i can
keep dieting stop dieting stay at 300 be
healthy and active
way better than being a 400 maybe two
years later you're like you know what i
feel pretty good
let's go to 250 and voila there's your
chance all right
number five this is a big one tons of
people get this wrong
your eventual fat loss goal should take
you between three and four percent
below your target maintenance so if you
want to live life at 150
you got to get three or four percent
below 150
yeah that's gnarly so you're going to be
somewhere in the low 140s low to mid
140s why
because living a balanced life means
eating more food and a bit of junk it
also means more water weight at the end
of a diet a lot of times you're really
dried out as well
so if you get to 150 you're gonna live
normal life again you'll be at 157 in a
few months and you'll be like fuck
okay no big deal 157 is a great place to
be but it's not what you wanted so if
you really want to stabilize where you
wanted
and 150 is your goal get to 143 or
something like that
when you get there man you're going to
eat and
be normal and do your maintenance phase
as always and then at the end of the day
you're going to be somewhere between 147
and 150
and you're just going to be 100 fine and
and totally on the money
mission accomplished so make sure you go
a little further than you want to
okay and number six last one
there's always going to be a pull back
up usually
your fat cells multiply when you gain
fat but they just get smaller
individually when you lose fat and their
pull on nutrients is still
something there's a bunch of
psychological brain mechanisms involved
which means that if you've ever weighed
400 pounds
and you get back to 200 pounds compared
to your identical twin that always
weighs 200 pounds
you're gonna be more likely to try to
regain that weight back your hunger is
going to be a little there
your tendency to be physically active is
going to be a little lower so you have
to be a little bit proactive
all the time i know it kind of blows but
you know there are prices to pay for
getting super super overweight
here's the thing they're not super
expensive prices all you have to do is a
few things one is stay super active
which is fun and it's better for your
life anyway and it's super healthy right
number two is eat mostly healthy foods
number three is
you can have some junk binges and low
activity binges
as long as you get back to the healthy
train of high activity and healthy food
afterwards okay because if you
completely fall off oh you're going to
be headed back up in that direction but
if you know
you have like thanksgiving weekend you
don't even remember it because you ate a
bunch of
you know popcorn and chips and pizza and
clown body parts
my favorite food uh you know holy shit i
gained seven
or 17 pounds of body water oops back to
the health train
and by christmas you're exactly where
you're supposed to be body weight
christmas
you know three or four days there's
crazy again back on the health train and
the next time you
go crazy as you take a cruise with your
family in march you know and just those
little puzzle towel things as long as
you come back to healthy activity and
modulate your food intake no problem at
all regular people that have
been super heavy they can just sort of
naturally
tend to just bounce back themselves you
have to be proactive about it
not all the time just sometimes right if
your body weight especially gets about
two and a half percent higher than it's
normally been and stays there for a few
weeks
be easy on the junk until it falls back
down and there's your formula for
long-term success that's about it be
realistic
be patient the biggest factor with
long-term success if you have
the drive is time okay no amount of
drive replaces time
if you're ultra motivated you can't do
things faster than everyone you can just
do the things that take a long time
well that's what gets you ahead
consistency balance and time
they'll have you reaching g any pretty
realistic goal that you want
and now you have all the power to do
that because you know all the stuff from
all these videos
next time our last video series will be
about okay you got lean
but what if you want to get exotically
lean bodybuilding lean or something like
that that's a whole different animal
tons of different tips
we'll see you next week for that video
