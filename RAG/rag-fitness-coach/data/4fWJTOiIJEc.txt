hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
today's topic video is about how and
when
you should fix your technique during
hypertrophy training let's take a look
at what's on the menu specifically
first we'll talk about why fixing
technique is ever a good idea some
pretty convincing reasons there
we'll talk about a concept called
technique stray
and it sounds like what the heck is he
talking about but as soon as i explain
it you'll be like ah okay i know exactly
what that is
and we'll talk about technique renorming
news flash it's fixing technique that is
straight away from very good technique
we're going to talk about how to do it
you're going to talk about when to do it
we're going to talk about how to
introduce new exercises properly into
your program
and thus adjust their technique and
we'll talk about what this means
for tracking and making sure that you're
keeping track of your strength for reps
and making sure you're on track so here
is the deal
why do we need to fix technique ever
well
usually technique improvements in the
context of hypertrophy training and i
mean improvements not just changes
result in an improved sfr stimulus to
fatigue ratio
and the better your technique is the
more the improvement is in stimulus to
fatigue for example
using some kind of technique in squats
you're sitting back a little too far
around in your back a little too much
that ends up uh you know sort of
irritating your
joints in your spine and your hips a
little bit too much and thus the fatigue
is a little too high you use
a lot of weight to stimulate the quads
which again makes your systemic fatigue
and your rpe a little bit high
with your quads because you're sitting
back and away from them aren't getting
stimulated as much the stimulus is lower
the fatigue is higher
you fix your squat technique to where
you're a little bit more upright you're
breaking out your hips and knees and
you're letting your knees come forward
over your toes
not sitting back too much sitting down
and into your quads all of a sudden
your quad stimulus is elevated and the
fatigue from the actual
sort of joint and connective tissue
disruption to your lower back is better
it's
lower and the use less weight to get the
same reps come
as close to failure for the actual quads
and all of a sudden your systemic
contribution to fatigue is lower as well
so your stimulus is higher
fatigue is lower and that kind of thing
can occur for any exercise now
generally speaking you would think okay
i really sort of have figured out my
squat technique and but for a little
play here and there
my curl technique my press technique and
everything else should be pretty well in
line
i've watched all the other rp technique
videos i know what i'm doing my
technique is good
and that's absolutely 100 true except
for every now and again all of us get
caught in the following uh
phenomenon of technique stray once we
have our good technique
all of us because we're all egotistical
and we want prs we also know how related
rep strength is to hypertrophy gains and
because of the progression model that a
lot of us use which is to try to break
many pr's more or less every session
from the beginning of a measure to the
end we're really driven to do better and
better better each session which is a
good thing we
never want to drop it but this process
of trying to do a little bit better a
little bit better
at some point even if it's not
consciously in your head though
sometimes it is
there comes a little bit of a trade-off
between what is a really good technique
to stimulate the muscle
and what is a technique that allows us
to get uh five pounds more on the same
reps
or one more rep added to the set and if
that happens a few times a few times a
few times it's no big deal
but over the course of half a year to a
year what started out is a good squat
technique that
really hit your quads over months and
months of pr
chasing might have started to morph a
little bit more and more
into a technique that just let you lift
more weight maybe without stimulating
your quads as much and causing a little
bit too much fatigue for that stimulus
right and that basically comes from the
idea of
just getting the reps done versus having
every rep meet the quality standards of
the highest possible stimulus to fatigue
ratio
it has to happen to almost everyone it
just happens at different rates
so your technique starts out excellent
and super crisp and it strays away
over time into technique that usually
isn't just
randomly off it's off to try to get you
to lift more weight but at the expense
of stimulus to fatigue ratio for the
target muscle
for technique straight we have a concept
to combat it
and it's called technique renorming and
that's when you drop
all attachments to the usual loads and
reps a lot of times this happens
when you've done your fifth set of
squats at the end of a meso and you're
like
man i hate a pr but i swear to god i
don't even know what squats are doing
for me anymore
someone's like your quads are hit up
you're like i don't know my back just
hurts
i feel like i'm just lifting the weight
i gotta be honest with myself
and then you drop all attachments to the
usual loads and reps because you realize
like
for you to actually do a quad focused
squat with good technique for that
there's no way you're going to be doing
any remotely reps that you're doing
currently and the load if you're going
to do the same reps has to be
way way lower so you just drop all your
attachments you know what i'm clean
slating my squat
i don't care what i squatted before for
how many reps so to speak
and i'm just gonna go back to perfect
technique or even better technique
not only are you sitting back less now
you might have widened your stance a
little bit so you can sit more forward
and down and really nail your quads like
you know what i have watched other
people do this technique i'm trying now
i knew it was better for my quads but i
was lifting more weight i didn't want to
stop lifting more weight
i'm just going to do this really really
good technique now you forget all your
old numbers
and this applies to a bunch of lifts
that applies to every single one but
just a few examples for you
the knees forward on squat example we've
already beat to death pausing on lateral
raises sometimes you can get into this
habit of swinging the laterals and
you're maybe not pulling them as high
if you start pausing them at the top for
a second and pause at the top it gets
rid of a ton of technical air it really
fries your delts
but gee you got to drop a lot of weight
or a lot of reps off
that just has to happen you got to cut
that ego out pull downs and lean
sometimes we take an athletic lean into
pull downs at the bottom to put our
chest up and really crunch our lats in
the back but sometimes that tends to get
into where you're starting to lean
on purpose to swing the weight down and
every now and again you gotta just
forget what you're lifting rub some
weight and just renorm your technique
completely and do them much more upright
with just a little chest lift
and it can be an ego hit if you accept
it as one but you don't have to because
this is a very good idea for hypertrophy
that's the whole point
once you renorm your technique you find
a new technique which really just takes
about a session to be like okay this is
my new technique because you're an
experienced lifter used to doing this
used to lifting and you know what good
technique is you've just strayed away
from it once you've renormed it
then you can begin to push up loads and
reps again just the same way
but really being careful to keep great
tech and look you were careful before to
keep great tech
it just strays every now and again this
doesn't mean once you renorm that you
never have to renorm again
you'll have to renorm multiple times
throughout your career but it'd be good
to renorm like once every year or two
years
versus like once every two or three
months so it's good to try to have as
crisp technique as possible
but every now and again renorming is a
good idea and it's okay if you have to
do it every now and again
now how do we renorm and when do we
renew
okay so you only renorm which is to say
change your technique to a pretty new
technique for getting all the old loads
and wraps
if your sfr is clearly down or your
externally viewed technique is clearly
off
okay if your sfr is very good and
externally people are like dude that's a
ball or hack squat you got nothing to
worry about don't change your technique
you might on the next set or on the next
rep or on the next day
try a little bit harder to have really
crisp technique and in that way you may
never need to renorm because you're
always on the ball
but a lot of folks uh get to this
perfectionist thing
and they try to renorm like every other
week
like they do a hard set of incline bench
and then like sort of they say
that kind of feels off next week i'm
just going to focus on mind muscle
connection and perfect technique
and they use this kind of as a crutch
sometimes intentional sometimes not kind
of as an excuse
to get away from hard training at the
end of the day once you have a good
technique
muscle growth comes from pushing the
sets hard close to failure
and progressively increasing the amount
of weight the amount of reps you're
doing over weeks and weeks
if you renorm all the time you're
essentially going up up down up up down
up up down and you never really get to
pushing yourself hard because you're
paranoid that your technique isn't
perfect technique never needs to be
perfect needs just be very very good if
it's already very very good do not
renorm
don't do it right so this is a process
that should only be really needed once
or twice a year for most folks a little
bit more often
if your technique is living but it's
another problem if your technique slips
so much
that you need to renorm every month you
have to work on just session to session
making sure you have good technique
that is going to solve a lot of your
problems but for everyone or almost
everyone
renorming every now and again is a good
idea we just want to have such good
technique and such consistency
that we don't need to do too often and
if your shit is already really really
good
don't renorm out of sheer paranoia this
happens a lot don't let it happen to you
now here's the thing when to renorm
has a constraint it might take a whole
session to experiment and find your best
tech again
you don't simply like stop doing a hack
squat warm-up one session let's say in
uh micro cycle four of a five-week
accumulation like
hard training today's a hard day you
don't simply go okay i'm gonna do new
squat technique today new hack squat
technique
and get a really good hard workout
because it takes usually a session
to practice with much lighter weights
not close to failure
your new technique that you're settling
in your brain learns that and then next
time you can start slowly going up and
up and up
right so we don't just want to do this
randomly at in the middle of hard
training
so that means overload is really only
going to occur
two sessions or later and thus we have
some rules
for when to renorm now these are hard
rules they're soft rules which means the
more of them you apply the better
if you don't apply one or two that's
okay so generally speaking
we want to renorm perhaps at the
beginning of a mesocycle and during a
d-load is a really good idea
new exercise technique during a deload
there's no pressure for you to do well
you can just focus on the technique and
the d-load handle itself this is no
requirement
for overload to begin with if you're not
doing it during dealer especially and
even if you are
you want to renorm second or third
exercises you still want your first or
second exercises
in a session to be hard and so you want
to renorm an exercise you can push it
to an exercise that's like second or
third or fourth in your training session
so that you're not so you know you're
already tired you already did the main
work now you can just practice it a
little bit the requirement for overload
is not that great
and you can use less weight right that's
the second one or third one
use light weights not heavy weights you
don't renorm a 405 pound squat by
squatting 405 differently
you renorm a 405 pound squat by sweating
315 in the new style
and then in the next micro cycle after
that you might go 365 for very
controlled reps and then 75 85 405
15 25 and then you're off you know to
the races so
another one is far from failure you
can't renorm sets that go close to
failure because as you go close to
failure whatever new technique you're
trying
breaks down so ideally when you renorm
you want it to be first of all like 10
rir and second of all the next workout
after and this is why during d-loader at
the beginning of meso is a great idea
you want that next workout to be maybe
three reps in reserve and then two and
then one you don't want to do like
a renorming technique session and the
next workout is all the way to failure
because your technique is very very
likely to break down
and rather than just breaking down
revert back to the old technique
obviating the entire purpose of
renorming to begin with
think of it this way the first session
of renorming is practice
the second session and after is
incrementally higher and higher stimulus
so you're not trying to renorm and be
like oh man great workout
which is counterintuitive right someone
would be like hey i heard you changed up
your hack squad did it hit your quads a
lot you're like yes
i think it will i've practiced the new
technique and it really feels like it's
hitting my quads i don't know about
at higher reps close to failure and with
heavy weight but i'm sure
as hell gonna find out in the coming
sessions right because usually people be
like oh i switched it up and it felt
great
not the best idea you want to switch it
up when it's submaximal so you have the
play and experimentation to really move
your body how you need to
without worrying in the moment about am
i getting a great stimulus on every rep
because that's another thing
if you start close for benching and
you're like okay every single one of
these hit my triceps you make it locked
into a technique or
good enough and i can keep going if
you're using light weights not to fail
you there's no pressure for you to
overload
you can do every rep a little bit
differently and be like ah like a fifth
weapon you're like yes this flaring the
elbows this way
really really works for me now i'm gonna
try that actually overloading later when
i've already had a couple more sets of
practicing this technique you want to
do not want to rush in to renorming it
uh
makes all of the benefits go away so a
quick example here
let's say your close grip bench feels
way off like you're just pushing the
weight at this point someone's like
triceps you're like i don't know
joints so what do you do you finish the
mesocycle okay so whatever meso you're
in finish with your good technique that
you have now good technique notice it's
not great
uh and hit your pr's or whatever don't
change it halfway through whenever you
start with your meso unless it's really
hurting your joints or something uh
don't just stick with the technique and
just try to do it pretty well
right but don't like throw away all your
numbers and renorm in the middle of a
mess
finish up and this this rule right here
this recommendation
uh gets rid of a lot of that sort of
paranoid or very norming that people do
whether they're meso you know they're a
microcycle two of a meso and they're
like oh i need to change up my incline
like don't do that okay just keep doing
what you're doing just try to do it
really well
switch to incline close grip different
exercise in the next meso so that's your
primary you know
close grip pushing movement no flat
cross gripping for an entire meso
the reason we do this is because we want
the old technique to wash out a little
bit your body tends to forget techniques
and when it's forgotten a bad technique
introducing a new technique is more
likely to take over and learn
because if you're always doing a bad
technique a new technique just kind of
gets
sort of funneled in there and it is very
difficult to draw a difference between
the two
like if you're learning spanish spanish
spanish for a while not speaking spanish
for a while and then picking up french
later is probably a better idea than
learning spanish spanish smash and then
starting to learn french because all of
it kind of mixes together not exactly a
great analogy but i think it conveys
some kind of meaning
next after a whole mesocycle
of not doing close grip in the in after
that meso is in that next mesos where
you didn't do it in that deload
you introduced close grip flat in the
new technique experiment with it during
the deload as like a third exercise or
something no pressure to do well at all
find your new technique and practice it
and then in the next
meso you can reintroduce it as a first
exercise again with a new tech
low reps in reserve three or something
like that and then ease into it and go
go go and then eventually pr
that's one way of doing here's another
example let's say your bent row feels
way off like
you know you're meeting like you're
coming up and sort of swinging it you're
not feeling a whole much of anything
and you know some stuff is off you know
you need to clean it up to actually hit
your back better
finish the meso don't change halfway
through same idea here
next meso your first movement you're
gonna switch to dumbbell rows okay so
bent rows are gone and in the end
just like the same way in the end of the
this meso that you did
no bent rowing just dumbbell rowing you
introduced
your uh bent row in the d-load of that
meso so
in the d-load for the max meso but in
this next measure that you're doing it
so the mazda c
d you did uh meso of bent rows i mean
they got crappy next meso all dumbbell
rows until that deload
practice bent rows light and then this
next meso you actually use bent rose but
as like a
second or third exercise so you're not
cranking super crazy pr's
because you have an exercise or two
before that really smashes the back
maybe some one arm roads or some pull
downs or pull-ups
you can focus a little bit more with
lighter weight in the background really
get your technique crisp
when it doesn't have the pressure of
being a first high performance exercise
and then after that meso bent row is
crisp it's great you've had a whole meso
of practice and it's put on some muscle
for you
the next muzzle you again rotate it into
the first exercise keeping your new
technique and then everything is
hunky-dory
now new exercises how to introduce them
and how to deal with the tracking
component all right
so you don't have to when you start new
exercises of any kind or renorm
start them during the deload you can
just start them in meso one
but it's sorry microcycle one of the
meso the first week
but it's a good idea so give it some
thought
and there's really no downsides um and
especially if you know it's an exercise
that really like takes some time to get
some wind under your sails
some exercises are so simple like
machine presses
or or exercises that you're really good
at you really know what you're doing
you just start them in week one and
you're good to go other exercises just
new ones not even renorm ones
you know like the first session always
kind of sucks and you need to play
around with it like upright rows
your first session is always like i
don't even know where i'm going but if
you do it during a deload that
frustration is during the deload
and then you do some learning and at the
end of the deal you're like okay i
figured out my bar path again i hadn't
done it in a while
and then in the micro cycle one of the
next meso it's gravy
stimulus right away so that way you
don't have to waste a session
finding your footing that first session
can be stimulative you find your footing
during the deal
not a must but not a terrible idea now
what about tracking
because the renorming took like some
weights and reps that we were building
up like this
and just went ah right we have to nuke
those numbers
because if we stay attached to them
there's no way renorming is going to
happen
a lot of times changing your technique
for bodybuilding purposes for
hypertrophy purposes actually reduces
your performance
because you're no longer using your body
as a machine to lift as much weight as
possible
using it as a machine to stimulate the
target muscle as greatly as possible for
example
on dumbbell flies to lift the most
weight you might be cutting your range
of motion
and bringing your elbows in renorming
might take your elbows out and make you
go deeper
you just lost a shield of weight in reps
what are you supposed to do look back
and be like oh
guess i got to do the 50s again for tens
but with your new technique the 40s for
10s are tough
there's no way to reconcile that so you
have to nuke your old numbers that
doesn't mean you erase them out of your
notebook but you just got to look at
them and take them with a greater solver
okay that was for that technique
now we have a renorming it's like they
do with olympic weightlifting records
every
five or ten years they just cut all the
records off and the world records clean
them out and then these new world
records
so people have to accomplish them fresh
sort of with drug testing or something i
don't know
so here's the deal your first meso after
you
renorm okay the new technique is a wash
to compare to previous mesos okay so
don't be like oh man my squat went down
by 40 pounds yeah no shit you were on
purpose doing that okay so don't worry
about it you didn't get weaker or
something like that
you had a great measure of stimulating
the target muscle much more than you
were
because you know your old technique was
really really crappy now the second meso
and on
you can start to compare more to your
previous mesos a little bit but you can
definitely compare it to your last
measure so there's the first mezzo you
went up from squats from
you usually squatted four or five plus
four reps now you squatted 365 to 385 in
your first mezzo okay
in your second meso still great
technique the new technique you go from
375 to 395. now that is really really
good for comparisons
and then the comparison pr train gets
rolling rolling rolling and it keeps
going from multiple mesos
multiple blocks a few micro cycles so on
and so forth right
now some big renorms
might still be way off in performance
even months later
because of the the nature of the
difference that you actually imposed
though they are much better in the
stimulus to fatigue ratio so it's still
okay
um for example you know your squat max
for tens might have dropped by 50 pounds
okay with a new technique how long is
going to take you to put 50 pounds on
your 10rm in the squat
it could take it take like two years so
you'd be like yeah i used to squat 405
for tens now i'm squatting 335 for tens
but my quads are just screaming at me
way more i know it's better
it's a big eagle hit but you got to take
it if you want what's best for your body
for hypertrophy results and you might
notice okay that good
if we're renorming how the hell are we
supposed to keep track of long-term
strength increases
which are the key to keeping track of
muscle growth well this is why
tracking multiple exercises it's always
better than just one
people say oh i'm doing my rm test on
squats to see if my quads are going to
hold up
you should be doing rm tests at the end
of every mesocycle the peak of
accumulation
on all of your lag exercises all of your
quad movements and if they're all going
up in the right direction you know
you're onto something so people say oh
my squat dropped by 50 pounds but
i'm eating massive prs on my leg press
my hat squats sky high compared to
anything it ever was so is my lunch so
is my leg extension
look if if your hat squat and leg press
and lunge and leg extensions are all in
the stratosphere
better than ever before and your hack
squat's down
50 pounds but you know it's because you
renorm the technique to have a better
mind muscle connection
and not lift as much brutal weight as
you could with your back now you're
lifting more with your legs
are you really going to look at that
squat and be like man i must be getting
smaller because my squat's down
no way because all of your other lifts
are up i'll tell you guys this if you're
actually getting weaker or smaller
rather if you're getting smaller muscles
all of your lifts are going to be down
across the board
but if almost all of them are up or all
of them are up but the lift you renormed
is down it can be down for months and
years you shouldn't care about it
you should just care about once the
renorming occurred is it trending back
up now
at its own slow and steady pace and all
the other exercises doing well
that's it folks give this some thought
shoot some questions
for your other viewers and other experts
in the in on youtube
into the into the comments below and if
you
guys want me to take on any new
intellectual topics and talk about any
intricacies how do we do this how do we
do that what about this concept
maybe you've heard someone else talk
about a concept i can address it in
these little informational videos going
forward
thanks for tuning in see you next time
