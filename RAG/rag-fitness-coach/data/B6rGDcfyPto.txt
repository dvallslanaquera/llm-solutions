hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
welcome to the first episode of the
hopefully ongoing targeting the muscle
series super simple series we take
exercises that are designed for
hypertrophy for muscle growth and we
break them down a little bit to give you
guys some quick tips on how to make that
exercise target the muscle you want it
to hit better
today's episode is episode number one it
is the leg press we already have a bunch
of videos similar to this giving you
technique mistakes and technique basics
but here we're gonna zone in on if
you're doing most of the techniques
pretty well already but you just can't
feel the quads in this case what are
some tips that we can give for you to
play around with in your own training
that with your clients with your online
folks and see if it helps so here we go
all right folks tip number one in
getting to feel your quads more on the
leg press
is about making sure that your quads
have the maximum range of motion to
travel through produce force especially
important is that eccentric loading at
the very bottom of the movement so you
want to get as deep of a stretch as
possible and one of the big critical
factors to that first of all getting the
right leg press thank you arsenal
strength but second of all whatever leg
press you do have
take that platform and make sure that it
is not
all the way up like this you're going to
be really bent at your hips it's going
to be impossible to get your knees low
without rounding your back in most cases
so what you want to do is adjust the
machine down until you have a comfy
relationship between how hard you have
to grip the handles to not get shot out
of the seat you want the seat to settle
you in and the weight to press through
your hips but the same time the lower
the seat goes the more knee flexion you
have for me personally
i like on the arsenal to have one hole
visible but it's on you which one you
pick
make sure that you understand most
commercial leg presses the very bottom
back no holes take it all out go all the
way down that's probably the best angle
give that some thought and you will find
that many leg presses are not maybe as
bad for hitting the quads as you once
thought
alright folks tip number two so
technically speaking the higher on the
leg press you put your feet
the less range of motion see if i can do
a demo here the less range of motion
your quads are going to have i mean i'm
kind of hitting my gut over here i can't
really go any lower i'm getting a third
of the way down so what you want to do
if you want to maximize the amount of
weight you lift on the machine
to impress somebody absolutely put your
feet as high as possible but
if you want to maximize quad engagement
you want to put your feet as low as
possible
such that you still get to drive from
the heel i'll do it wrong i'll put my
feet too low watch my heels when i go
through a full range of motion at the
knee
you see how my heels come up no bueno
puts a lot of force this way through the
knees if you're used to it it's fine
with your regular leg press loads it
could be a bit of a shocker actually
stresses your
calf tendons and your calves which you
just might not want in addition to that
the worst part is it lowers how much
force you can press because when your
body feels a stable powerful heal it
actually just you in your brain senses
that it allows you to produce much more
force through the lower body if power
lifters ever get on their toes in a lift
it's a missed lift so what you want to
do is experiment you want to start you
know nice and high and get real good
tension there on the heel and then move
your feet maybe a few inches down and
see how that feels and you'll have to go
all the way down each time to really
trial it so for me my personal best this
is sort of the gym we own here and this
is my machine so i already know where to
put my feet watch my heels as i descend
all the way down they're still touching
and powerful and if i moved even a
centimeter down they would come off so
finding the lowest
possible
part of the pad which still lets you
push the heels gives you maximum knee
flexion and maximum quad hypertrophy
[Music]
a lot of leg presses are designed not so
great
some of them are designed much better
than others this one is absolutely
designed very well but we can rig
machines even better a big problem on
the leg press if you're going super deep
is that if you push the pad low enough
if that's even possible for you to get
full knee flexion without sort of a
little dangerously rounding your lower
back at the bottom and having the back
come off the pad having no force
transduction stability there against the
pad if that happens
if you lean the bat the pad back enough
you just get shot out of the leg press
and you just can't hold on to the
handles if you lean the pad forward
enough such that your upper back is
strict into the pad and won't move a lot
of times that forward lean posteriorly
shifts everything and then you start
getting that background the way to
combat this is
the yoga pad thanks a lot yoga i've
never done you before but i'm keen to
learn jk so i don't really know what to
use these for in yoga my assumption is
something insanely tantric
anyway
imaginations aside these are cool pads
they're on amazon just type in
purple yoga pad on amazon people ask me
how i found it that's how i did
and you just put them right here i use
two because i'm insanely inflexible you
could use one
right
at the very bottom here's what you're
going to do super critical
your butt sits right here it doesn't sit
on these
these are for right under your lower
back butt crease
right here your butt still goes on the
seat
your lower back goes right into these
and then what you're able to do
is still have your shoulders and back
into this pad and because it's
cantilever this way you won't get shot
out
but you've
rounded your mid back a little bit and
remember the mid back part that you
rounded is going straight into the pad
there's no problem with injury there
because there's a shitload of stability
your vertebrae are not being asked to
produce hardly any force they're just in
a position and then there's a pad here
force here and they just sit there no
big deal but it leverages your lower
body up a little bit such that you don't
have to round the back
under pressure when you're doing this
exercise so if i sit down and demo
notice i'm sitting right here i'm
putting my butt straight down into the
seat
and then i often like to come up
and really tuck it in
put my feet where i need to
when you unrack it's a little weird
because the pad will compress
get nice and stable and then once you're
here
you can go all the way down no problem
notice
my lower back is still touching
sometimes there's even some space
between your butt and the seat no big
deal lower back is steady upper back is
steady everything feels great i have all
of my power safe effective and good to
go
another tip to feel your quads better
and more during the leg press
occurs from changing the way you're
thinking about foot position
from something a little bit artificial
to something more
natural you know like
herbal tea
bad analogy so
check this out a lot of people like
press with a closer stance because they
thought that's more quad activation
turns out that's and when they
press with a closer stance watch what
happens to my knees in relation to my
tummy and my chest
my quads and knees eventually touch and
i'm limited in my range of motion sure
this activates the quads a lot but it
misses that deep stretch
misses the ability to feel the quads as
much also some people feel strange with
just the feet pointing forward it is
actually artificial your body is very
capable of doing it but it might not be
ideal now check this out here's the tip
you take your feet
and you
point your toes out a little bit you can
even stay with a closer stance and point
them out or i would recommend a little
bit more of a medium stance trust me and
the research confirms this your quads
will get just as active with a slightly
wider stance as a narrow stance accept
more because now here's what you're
doing your toes are pointed slightly out
to comfort
your knees
as you go down are also going to point
in the same direction of your toes and
i'm going to do this
the heebie-jeebies just thinking about
that right as your knees come out
especially if you're very flexible your
tummy and chest get to go between them
and they get to go that much lower
giving your quads that bolorific
trademark term stretch
and a ton of tension and a ton of growth
and then of course happiness so if we're
here
well i'll go actually do the bad one
again so here
okay my lower back's already rounding
i take my toes i point them out i widen
my stance a bit and then my knees go out
and look at all this crazy range of
motion that i found it's gonna feel a
million times better
is there a proper position
for the knees no it's whatever you feel
comfortable so like with many of these
tips feel free to play around and see
what works best for you
[Music]
last tip for how to feel the quads more
on the leg press assuming hopefully
you've integrated all the other tips
we've already been doing them
is to do two things differently
one is to slow down the descent slow
down the eccentric this is both probably
good for hypertrophy anyway but at the
very least what are you using to slow
down well you're using the quads and
that really lets you establish a better
mind muscle connection versus just going
up and down and someone's like do you
feel your quads you're like i'm kind of
just doing the work if you have to milk
the eccentric then you're going to be
much more in touch with your quads in
addition to that it's especially easy to
feel your quads stretch and pull apart
giving you a great mind muscle
connection and of course more
hypertrophy if you're at the bottom
holding it for a second so the two tips
are slow eccentric and a nice deep pause
if you don't need these things you can
get amazing workouts doing neither one
of them if you're hitting your quads
right but you're watching this video
maybe because you have trouble feeling
your quads in the leg press and these
two are killer killer help so
i'll do the regular leg press first and
there's not a thing wrong with it if you
can feel your quads getting hit well so
regular leg press
down
and up
down and up
oh i knocked that i locked out my
legs help ebola all right
if you have trouble feeling your quads
slowly center
feel them and feel them and feel those
quads stretch and pull and pull and
pause
and then out
don't worry about feeling them on the
way up not important on the way down
quads quads feel your knees coming
forward heels strong in the platform sit
deep stretch it's going to hurt like
crazy right here
and then press out
yes you'll be able to use much less
weight
yes
the cute girls in the corner are going
to giggle and make fun of you and be
like i think i was so strong but he's
weak
those through son too so they're all
demonic
but in any case you'll have jack quad so
when the demons come with you you
can kick him in the face
i ran out of to say that makes any
sense folks thanks for tuning in we'll
see you next time for the next technique
series of tips for the next target
muscle and hey listen
throw these
favorite exercises of yours that you're
having trouble with activating whatever
muscles or feeling them into the
comments below and every time we do
these videos if you haven't gotten to
your video yet
throw them in there i will demo every
single exercise i am competent at which
means you get at least two demos
