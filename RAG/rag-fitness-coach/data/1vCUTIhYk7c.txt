hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
what can you learn from the best lifters
about how they train about how they diet
using their words that they talk about
and their examples of what they're
actually doing and
what should you probably not take away
from the best lifters that you can have
the best results
for yourself what are we going to be
talking about today in more specifics
first we're going to define really quick
what we mean about the best lifters
secondly we'll talk about how to examine
what's actually going on
with what they're doing sometimes it's a
little bit hazier than it seems
we're going to talk about what you
should probably reserve judgment on
there's some things that lifters
at the top say or do that you probably
should be like ah
then we're going to talk about what you
can learn and can take away and then
lastly
just a bit of a reminder to be a thinker
and not a parrot
so let's get into it easiest slide today
defining the best they're just jack
dudes right people who are more jack
than average considerably pro
bodybuilders for sure
top ranked maybe top 200 ranked power
lifters okay they're very worth paying
attention to
olympics bound weight lifters for
example people that are fucking good
right and this also includes the most
jacked people at your gym
right they're absolutely worth looking
at fundamentally this isn't something i
was actually planning on addressing but
i'll say it
the question of like well why do we care
what they're do the proof is in the
pudding
okay if you were trying to design a
rocket and there's a country that's
designed all the best and fastest
rockets
maybe they made some mistakes maybe they
just have an overfunded program
maybe they're doing really dumb shit but
just succeeding anyway but at the end of
the day
because they got the rockets that are
the fastest you know if you find out
something about the rocket program it's
good to pay attention right
and all of the speculation in the world
from small not remotely jacked lifters
no matter how
intelligent they are or how organized
their structure is no matter how much
they talk down and how stupid the bros
are
they're still pencil necked can i swear
yet
probably not pencil necked assholes
that are just not jacked and maybe
they're relatively jacked before they
started maybe not but when you look at
all of the most jack people in the world
for the love of god they're onto
something there's at least something we
can learn
right for sure now
there's a lot of sort of uneven ground
here
and it's not clear that all of the
potential lessons
are the good lessons we want so when we
look at
what the best are doing and saying we
can use some rough guidelines
to keep in mind just to make sure we're
not learning the wrong kind of stuff
so here they are first off we want to
look for mass
patterns okay if most or tons and tons
of lifters are doing something
that's great probably bears paying more
attention to
versus like if one or a few people are
doing something quirky they go what
about this bodybuilder what do you think
about they're doing
not much motherfucker because they're
one of a thousand people and the only
person
that does that now can you get an idea
about trying yourself
sure but if you like say a way of like
pressing that you're like this is the
way
trust me and and someone's like why like
because what's his name does it they're
like
but nobody else does that like well yeah
but he's jacked like give it so are tons
of other people right it doesn't make
any sense
it's totally cool to get inspired by
those ideas but it's better to stick to
mass patterns if you really want to
learn from the best
look at what most or many of them do
real real good idea
and then you start to think yeah you
know all of them probably probably not
for sure aren't wrong so maybe there's
something to see here
next huge one the test of time okay
there's tons of shit that all of the top
guys start doing at the same time
that's new that ends up not working and
they all discard like one of them is
like that
that myo bullshit like the electric shit
you plug into your quads
and the machine fucking fires your quads
for you you do leg extensions and they
might have some kind of tiny marginal
benefit but sure as hell not worth the
price of a machine
and a lot of top guys are using it
because they're always looking for the
next cool thing
but like two years ago they weren't
using it and in two years i can fucking
promise you they won't be using it
you don't want to be like a fad rider so
if something's been practiced for years
and it's not a new thing
it's probably worth paying attention to
so powerlifters have been training heavy
and hard for decades bodybuilders have
been eating higher protein diets for
decades you know there's probably
something to that but if tons of the new
bodybuilders are taking this new
supplement
you know like citrulline malate well
everyone takes it like yeah well maybe
in two years they won't and you'll feel
like a chump when you try it right
so you can try new things for sure but
if you're trying to learn from the best
your better option is to learn what
they've been doing time tested over a
long period of time
next up you've got to be able to
separate common insights that the top
people can have versus common flaws and
there's really interesting ways
to separate these here's one example uh
you look at how a lot of bodybuilders
train and it's kind of like sort of
plenty of cheating and lots of partial
range of motion
not all the time but some of the time
and you're like man that must be because
it's good
but then you look at how almost all of
the top female bodybuilders train or
relative to their genetics uh the fact
that they're female
they're just as jacked relatively
speaking as the males but they've milked
the shit out and a lot of times they're
even leaner which makes no goddamn sense
so these are people you really want to
fucking pay attention to you see a real
female bodybuilding pro at the gym
you're like
what the fuck that is unbelievable right
almost every female trains with strict
technique
and no cheating at all so if if cheating
and bullshit momentum is this crazy
strategy that the pros use to get as big
as possible
how come none of the females do it they
do almost everything else well the
answer is they're not egotistical
assholes like men
the number one reason why pro
bodybuilders cheat and
and do momentum stuff is because they're
fucking ego driven assholes like the
rest of us men and they just fucking
want fucking
how many reps more and it's thoughtless
but they're all very highly
testosterone-driven men
so like half of them tend to do that and
half of them keep it in check and do
good technique
but if you look at they have to do it
like oh there's something to that eh
half of them don't do it so that's hint
number one that it's maybe a flaw and
not an insight
and the huge hint is like females hardly
do it at all and you're like man like
there's no way they're just not using
this incredible strategy hey
truth be told the female pros they use
all the same drugs these all the same
dieting protocols these all the same
kind of training splits
but they don't happen to cheat almost
ever and their technique's almost always
better and it's like okay maybe it is
the male ego so definitely give them
some thought
to make sure you're not perioding again
we'll have that slide later a common
flaw
but actually doing a common insight okay
and that takes a little bit of thought
it's not immediately apparent every time
what's going on
next training age you've got to keep
this in mind
almost all the best guys are the
advanced guys they've been training for
a long time
so their protocols for training for diet
for everything are designed for their
late
training age and that means you can't
just apply them to yourself if it's your
first year of training
decisions not work like you start a year
of training and you look at what ronnie
coleman is doing or phil heath or
whatever
and you're like i'm going to do that
because they're that big and that's what
they're doing well maybe they didn't get
that big doing that
they're doing that now because they are
that big and maybe riddled with injuries
may be concerned about their waist size
and a bunch of other stuff you have no
business concerning yourself with
you do not copy the advanced because you
know they're doing something a little
bit different
right like if you try to take um you
know a course about how to like draw
your pistol and shoot it at opponents
and put it back in
you don't start with a navy seal
training of like drawing multiple
weapons and
discarding them and knives and all this
crazy shit you're not at that level you
don't need that shit it's wholly
inappropriate for you
you need the basics because you're going
to try to do maybe you'll shoot yourself
in the foot
as soon as you take your gun out right
you need something different yeah the
navy seals are the best
right but they don't train like that now
they don't say everyone else should
train like that that's only for the best
there's a different training age
for everyone else same with lifting
powerlifting bodybuilding strong man
so on and so forth cool example from
strong mario kart
most of the best strong men in the world
do lots of event training
nowadays right but when they started out
most of them started out either
through just general muscle building or
power lifting and did mostly compound
barbell heavy basics and just ate a
shitload of food
and then eventually got into the events
if you're a first year strong man
strong man you're not big enough to be
that yet okay and you're doing like tons
of technical work on the implements a
ton and easing up on the compound heavy
lifting
you're not going to go very far on the
sports you're never going to build the
raw size
and basic strength that you need for the
top so again you don't just copy the
routines at the top because you know
they're
very specific group of people next
genetics people at the top of lifting
community have slightly different
genetics than the rest of us
okay in what ways many ways but one of
the ones that stands out just as an
example
is a lot of them are more fast twitch
dominant they usually come from american
football backgrounds sprinting
backgrounds have athletic backgrounds
they're very fast for shaman which means
a couple of things they're going to
gravitate to in their own programs which
might not be
ideal necessarily for you one is lower
frequencies faster twitch muscle fibers
take more damage they take more time to
recover
they'll benefit from lower frequencies
of training a muscle group than you
might
another one is repetition ranges they
may benefit from training a little
heavier
than you might on average relatively
speaking maybe more in the five to 10
rep range
less than the 20 to 30 than you might
right volumes
faster individuals need physically less
number of sets to get the same stimulus
and more to grow
so some guy might say like man four sets
of leg press is all i need
twice a week to get my quads as big as
possible you're trying
i'm not even fucking sore i didn't feel
like i did anything how is this possible
and someone's like
shut up pussy you're too fucking small
to criticize do these four fucking sets
you're like does that make a lot of
sense no like you might be smaller and
slower twitch so you might be able to do
eight sets or 12 cents per session
benefit much more
and then when you get that big and
strong you may be doing six sets or you
never do four because you were never
that fast twitch to begin with so
example the genetics are different so
some of the application will be
different as well
i have to say but i will drugs folks at
the top a lot of times take drugs
right even if they say they don't
sometimes and that can change some
nutritional approaches another good
thing about drugs
is usually it functions almost exactly
like genetics it doesn't change things
in a really weird manner
it just lets you get away with more and
lets you put in more and not die
right so it's just what you can do less
and do more it just makes you better so
a lot of times it doesn't change a whole
lot but
some nutritional approaches especially
really particular ones are different
you see a lot of pro bodybuilders diets
you're like what the fuck do they eat
seven times a day
why is it real specific foods why is
there almost no fat well when you're
jamming
you know 50 i use of insulin and you
know 12 iu's of growth into yourself
every day
that changes carbohydrate significantly
changes carbohydrate dynamics
and you have to get very specific or you
go hypoglycemic and really terrible shit
happens right
it's a thing the straight up does not
apply to you unless you're
cramming yourself with farm so you've
got to be a little easy on those real
specifics especially with nutrition
because you got to think drugs are
probably part of the equation
lastly what you want to take away are
directions
general directions of intellectual
effort not exact
direct practices so for example when you
see a bodybuilder
and he weighs 250 pounds of easing 400
grams of protein a day
don't think i got to eat 400 grams of
protein maybe think i i
could experiment with a slightly higher
protein intake than i do now and see how
it affects me right
you go in that direction of higher
protein not exactly to the finish line
or 400 grams of protein
another one is you know someone says an
advanced lifter says you know
uh i train three times a week try
training three times a week maybe you
don't try to train three times a week
but you're currently training
you know once a week a muscle group
maybe go to twice a week see how that
feels if they say trade
four times a week and you're currently
at two maybe go to three right
you will understand all of the same
principles just getting closer to where
they are without jumping to where they
are right away
and where they are right away may be
wholly inappropriate for you or
appropriate only years down the line
now that is how to examine what you
see after the examination
what should you probably reserve
judgment on
and sort of not really invest a lot of
time in
or just a very sparse investment just to
try something okay this is the stuff
not to take away from what the best are
doing first exact programs
okay a lot of even top lifters will tell
you that's just a stupid idea
um and that includes the exact volumes
frequencies positivities
there's a thing though people want to
know the exact programs i post on my
instagram all the time and the exact
thing i'm doing and
people seem to be fascinated by it it's
cool i get the the fan thing i'm a fan
of a tunnel lifters i love seeing
lifters individual programs just like uh
just be like oh that's cool
like i like watching lord of the rings
i'm not trying to be a fucking hobbit
like i'm not gonna do that exact program
but it's cool to see
right so leave it at cool to see and
don't just copy it verbatim be like well
you know uh uh you know flex lewis does
18 sets
for side dell so i'm going to do 18.
shit does not work you will not turn
into flex lewis
doing 18 sets of side delts and and who
knows what else
negative could happen through that
misapplication next
exact exercise techniques not a good
idea to religiously copy you can
experiment with a few that you find
interesting
but don't just go doing them there's too
much diversity among the top people here
be like this is how guys row at the top
you look at five different rolling
videos and five different bodybuilders
do it completely differently you're like
okay i guess i was wrong right and
there's a ton of poisoning here
by the male ego a lot of exercise
techniques and bodybuilding suck
because the male ego is just a thing and
it makes you
throw technique to the wind you can tell
because a lot of the top power lifters
have way better technique
because they can't let their egos the
bin because they're held to very very
objective standards
so a lot of times be like oh man like
look at the way this guy does skull
crushers
or not just try to take maybe the gist
away or maybe try it like that but don't
be like this is how to do skull crushers
right
uh and that goes uh so more generally
for direct transfer of anything remember
genetics drugs training age etc they
really muddy the picture so if you take
an exact protocol for anything
don't do that try to get the ideas out
of it the principles
not exactly the thing that it is right
another one this is not always the case
but just a grain of salt people
say stuff and they might do some
different stuff
at the end of the day some folks are not
big thinkers okay you might you may have
a bodybuilder or power lifter in mind
that you're like oh man
i love this guy's physique i want to ask
him questions about how he got it and
you may get your wish and meet your
heroes i'm gonna tell you guys right now
and those of you who have
had this experience before please feel
free to comment uh in the comments below
you may be highly fucking disappointed
you may be like so how many sets a week
of quads do you do and they're like oh i
don't really count
sets and you're like huh what is your
favorite source of carbs and they're
like oh yeah
white rice and you're like i noticed you
eat a lot of oatmeal and they're like ah
not really but the last diet they
published online is like almost all
oatmeal and you're like
what the f what the fuck remember you
know them because they do this
really well or this really well not
because they do that really well their
coach might do that really well
maybe you should go talk to their coach
and maybe the lifter is uh
super insightful but maybe not so
careful here
very very much careful um sometimes what
they say might not make a whole lot of
sense
but then what they actually do might
make more sense and sometimes neither
okay so be careful
you're not necessarily dealing with
intellectual experts you're dealing with
individual people
some of whom are not that sharp i'm just
gonna fucking throw it out there this is
not news to anyone some of them are
really sharp
make sure you find out who's who and
listen to the sharp people more
okay next a single case or
individual anything is not good to build
anything upon
like can you get some inspiration from
that and try it sure
but don't make rules out of it for
example somebody curls in an interesting
way they flare their elbows out
you ask should i curl like that uh
maybe ask yourself maybe ask them and
they never reply
first of all maybe they're hurt like a
bunch of the ways i train
on video or like because i'm hurt like
you don't want to train like a hurt
person you can do a better job
right maybe they're too big to do it the
right way when i do skull crushers and
you guys might have seen this on video
like in the smith machine i do them
essentially jm style and i have to keep
my elbows out why
because my pecs are physically so
fucking big i can't pull my fucking arms
in i would love to it's physically
impossible and i'm not even that jacked
this guy's someone look up nicholasville
on instagram
and look at his physique and how the
fuck does he train at all because he's
just like a balloon filled with muscle
it's insane
you don't want to copy his exercise
techniques you can do a better job than
him
and if he could somehow magically keep
all his muscle size and have your
flexibility he would take it in a
fucking heartbeat
so careful about like oh well this guy
does this thing like this there could be
so many reasons for it that are not
optimization right they're even worse
than optimization they're constrained
from injury and flexibility so on and so
forth lastly
don't cherry pick okay you can get real
dogmatic
real quick about a practice that i can
find half of bodybuilders or
powerlifters
that don't do it people say oh man like
west side that's the way to get strong
be like okay most the top guys don't
even use west side in raw lifting you're
like
fuck so if you defend west side enough
you're gonna be backed into a corner
let's say you're like dude failure
you've got to train to failure every set
that's how the top guys do it you look
at the top guys that's not a holly door
a bunch of them don't train to failure
at all
right there was a big thing where like
jay cutler was on i think
uh followed abiad's channel and
forward's like you know
do you train to failure did you he's
like never maybe once and it was like
what
he won four olympias he trained for like
20 years never went to failure he's like
i just don't
for me it never really did a whole lot
you don't want to be like everyone you
don't train a failure you're gonna you
know you're gonna be a failure
and then like jay cutler's like hello
and you're like shit
uh okay i guess that doesn't work so try
not to cherry-pick
try to take more generalized things that
most people are doing
if you like something someone's doing
you can be inspired to try it but don't
go telling yourself and everyone else
that this is for sure the answer
all right now
that's a lot of stuff you should reserve
judgment on unless can't learn from
what can you learn the plus side first
probably what not to do okay if there's
a near consensus
from interviews from top people about
what mistakes did you make when you were
a young kid
don't do that shit they'll say a lot of
the same stuff i train with too much
volume i tried to progress too rapidly i
wasn't consistent with my nutrition i
wasn't worried about my sleep if they
all say that that was a bad idea
probably don't do those things and do
the opposite of those things great
takeaway
another one is near universal
fundamentals so
if pretty much all the guys at the top
lower their calories on a fat loss phase
eat a higher protein diet eat a
relatively low
fat diet when they diet and try to eat
as many carbs as possible eat
more than two or three meals per day
when they diet and they're all super
jacked
you know maybe some of those things
aren't necessarily true
but i would put my marbles in them
unless i have tons of research and tons
of counter examples to go the other way
some uh in this list include higher
protein dieting
heavier training heavy training you're
not going to get huge doing sets of 50.
dedicated rest almost all the guys at
the top take times to rest time away
none of them grind through
entire years and years and years with no
rest having a plan almost everyone has a
plan
focusing on progression almost
everyone's focused at least someone on
progression i just willy-nilly come in
and sort of have workouts
uh the essence of compound movements and
how to do them not the specifics but
like okay more or less the movement
pattern
the essence of a mind-muscle connection
that it's important almost everyone
preaches
by it almost everyone does it probably a
good idea to at least try this kind of
stuff
and lastly for the stuff that maybe
there's not a consensus on you can take
as interesting suggestions
right even when one or a handful of the
best
suggests suggested given practice uh he
maybe it's worthwhile to you
to try it so for example a food choice
someone says hey i really like
steak for these following meals try it
no big deal no love lost a cooking style
someone's like hey listen
air fryer will change your life when
you're dieting it doesn't mean you go
yelling at the hilltops and everyone
doesn't use one is stupid but maybe you
can
have go over a friend's house who has an
air fryer try and you're like oh my god
this is incredible right
exercise selection technique you can
absolutely try stuff just don't get
dogmatic about it right
before you try it it should pass at
least some logical test of being
reasonable if someone tells you to do
something that is making any goddamn
sense at all
you can try it but then after it fails
you'll be like what the hell was i doing
okay you only have a limited
bandwidth to try stuff try the stuff
that makes some sense right
most of the time and now it's not dogma
just something you try for yourself
again you're not telling other people
like if you don't train a failure you're
an idiot
just go home and train to failure a
bunch and see how it works right
and if it doesn't work well don't be
afraid to drop it out
all right so
how do we make sure to conclude all this
that we're thinking for ourselves
not just parroting what we think the
best all
seem to think or most seem to think a
couple of points here
first all of the how to examine points
from earlier
take those into considerations make sure
you're doing examining mass
patterns things lots of people do maybe
most or almost all do
think of the test of time what people
have almost all been doing
for 20 or 30 years in lifting probably
some underlying grains of truth to it
and that's not
total bullshit maybe but probably not
think about common flaws and don't get
messed up with those like the male ego
genetics drugs training age discounts
think
before you accept anything to make sure
you're getting the closer to the truth
that you can be number two everything
you learn
is at best a suggestion not a rule set
you never violate
not this is how it works period okay so
people will do that
they'll have facebook debates like none
of the fucking top guys do this
this is how the top guys do it if you do
it anyway you're fucking idiot like
imagine saying that about bodybuilders
from the 50s
like they were doing some odd shit and
be like that's how you get big
like the average weight trained college
student
who's dedicated is about as big as the
top 50s bodybuilders were
good god like imagine telling someone
like phil heath like hey man
you know the guys in the 50s didn't do
what you were doing dumb ass and you'd
be like i'm sorry what
like my arm is the size of all them put
together okay
so you don't want history to leave you
behind everything is a suggestion
everything is an open book
uh it's it's okay not to be dogmatic and
it's not it's okay to not
not write things off completely or think
you have to do it this way
another one independence of thought is a
really
great idea but it comes with some
responsibility so if you do something
that none of the top lifters do or very
few
you might be a thought leader you might
be ahead of the game and maybe later
other people
start doing what you were already doing
for a long time but
you should be humble about your ideas
because you can be wrong and unless you
like being stupid in public and
embarrassing yourself if you're going
against the grain
say you know i believe this is the right
way to do things i have my reasons
but i'm not going to go ahead and tell
everyone that this is 100 obviously the
truth because
you know not a lot of really jacked
strong people agree with me right
however if
you're doing something that nearly all
of the top lifters say is
not a good idea like you're very very
strong
and you're trying to do super high
frequency training almost all the top
lifters will tell you that it's not
sustainable
you can do it right but give it some
deep thought before you do
and make some mistakes you can't take
back right you get a torn pec
and someone's like how'd you do that
you're like trying to bench heavy five
days a week you're like okay
weren't you like a 400 pound venture
like yep didn't people tell you that was
a bad idea like yep everyone told me it
was a bad idea
and what did you think about that like
they're all fucking stupid are they
stupid now like no
i'm stupid now you got me right so if
you're really going against the grain
not just in a way people have never
thought of or in a way people are
neutral to
but in the way most people are like dude
don't do that uh give it some thought
you may be much smarter than everyone
else that's possible
but are you much wiser than everyone
else combined unlikely possible again
but unlikely so you want to be on the
side of likelihood not the side of being
a rare case
right lastly and this goes for almost
everything
try to be open-minded which means what
be willing to change
your views it's okay or not we don't
have to have an attachment to our views
you can be
pro this one thing you know today and
then years later you can change your
mind and be against it or pro something
else totally cool
be willing to try alternate approaches
don't just write things off
that's interesting i'm at least going to
try it be willing to buck the trend
sometimes a lot of people those mass
delusions are a thing
and they're all doing some shit wrong
and then if you buck the trend and do
the right thing
years later everyone else can catch up
to you and be like holy shit you were
right this whole time
right that's it's nice pass your ego but
the better thing is that you just didn't
waste time doing dumb shit so if you
look around and everyone's jumping off
bridges
don't jump off the bridge uh you know go
about your life maybe in the end that'll
be a much better thing
however just as much as you're willing
to uh you know be willing to buck the
trend and
sort of do the right thing by yourself
even if no one agrees you should also be
reverent
of the accomplishments of the best
okay you don't look at someone who
weighs 280 pounds in his veins and be
like the guy fucking knows nothing
nothing nothing so how the fuck is it
that he knows nothing and he's
everything you want to be
and you know everything and you're
nothing you want to be is there like a
time lag is it just he's taking every
single possible drug
is it your genetics are at zero and his
under 110
how does that work if you layer in a
bunch of the excuses at some point it's
just a shit festival of excuses
so when i'm looking at guys in a gym
and tons of them are jacked and tons of
them are lean or tons of super strong
and they're all doing a lot of the same
stuff
i may not agree with them a hundred
percent but even some reverence for it
like
take pause and be like hmm they might be
on to something maybe the answer to the
might
is they're not onto something but i'm
gonna leave that in there i don't
you never wanna write off people that
are incredibly well accomplished
right like you look at an olympic
champion wrestler and he beat everyone
you're like his technique's not gonna
work like
okay but it has worked now it might not
be the ideal technique there may be
great modifications you know that he
doesn't
but i wouldn't just go running and
saying this is worthless right so have
some respect have some remarks people
just why do i say this
incels on fucking reddit and shit do
this shit all the time like
fucking pros or idiots none of that shit
works what you need to do is
who the fuck are you you need to do like
natty's the way natties need to train is
what fuck you ain't even a natty you are
nobody you don't have a profile picture
what the hell would i listen to you how
many daddies you coached
how much do you bench nothing nobody go
away
right zero reverence is stupid because
it leaves you ignoring all the people
who have succeeded
now again they might not all be doing
the right shit there may be some
illusions there
but for love god they're onto some good
stuff right
lastly don't nut ride okay you're better
than that
when you pick a lifter that you want to
like just give them infinity blow jobs
or something you're like oh my god
what's his name does it so i'm gonna do
it
like if you met them and you came up to
a booth and you're like i do everything
you do i copy you
verbatim they're gonna be like okay so
excellent and what did you say your name
was awesome enjoy the ex ball i'll see
you later
and then they check to make sure that
parts of them are not missing you didn't
like
take shit away and take a lock of their
hair or some shit like that
right everyone's human everyone makes
mistakes it's awesome to have respect
for folks
but when someone you respect can do no
wrong
and you not ride the fuck out of them it
insults you and it insults them
and it does no good for anyone so when
you guys say out there oh doctor mike
says
dr mike is a fucking chump who could be
wrong about all this shit now
maybe he's not maybe some of the shit
he's saying is interesting
and maybe he talks about himself in the
third person weird
but in any case not writing
won't get you very far learning from
people will but at the same time being
skeptical
absolutely will folks give that some
thought we'll see a more jacked you
next time
