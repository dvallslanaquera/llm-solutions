what's going on guys so I've got a quick
update for you all um hopefully this
doesn't come as too much of a
disappointment um but I'm going to be
changing uh the competition at which
I'll be making my Pro debut um as many
of you guys probably know uh initially I
had planned to compete in the wmbf Pro
InterContinental in Edmonton Alberta
here in my homeland of Canada um
unfortunately uh the air fair to Ed is
pretty costly right about now um and
it's a little difficult to justify um
coughing up all that money just for you
know a competition that that I could
effectively achieve the same result at a
different show um the biggest
disappointment for me uh is the fact
that I'm first of all I'm not going to
get to meet the people who messaged me
or emailed me or whatever saying that uh
they were looking forward to meeting me
in Edmonton and watching me compete and
then also I was looking forward to
battling it out with in SEMA who the guy
who won the muscle Mayhem uh this year
and SEMA if you're watching and you want
to try to make it out to New Haven and
we can battle it out there if we both
make the overall then of course you're
welcome to do that and I would love to
get on stage with you I think you have a
fantastic physique whether I'll go on to
do worlds four weeks after my Pro debut
uh I'm not completely decided about that
yet for now I'm just going to deal with
what's immediately in front of me which
is finishing out these next 5 weeks now
instead of 6 weeks because the show is
one week earlier and uh just bring the
best possible package that I can to the
stage with the amount of time that I
have left and um enjoying the rest of
this prep as much as I possibly can um
so thank you guys for all your support
and everything I do read every comment
and and every message that that has been
sent to me along the the road so far all
right guys so that's the update from me
um and I hope you enjoy the rest of this
workout

and we are
go through the wastel to the house
and that's a queue that I use for the
lunges and for squats deadlifts and
everything just to drive through my
heels and instead of pushing off with my
back foot I just let that heel be the
thing that kind of lifts me up and then
I keep my glutes tight the whole way
through and uh find if I use a low bar
position I can shift the emphasis a
little bit more to the glutes I want to
hit the quads a little bit more I will
take a bit more of a high bar position
keep a little bit more of an upright
posture and then also I'll actively Flex
my quads um after each and every rep and
I usually do those not
walking here we
