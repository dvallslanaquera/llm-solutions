so use your body
one more good technique no hips we only
count the good ones
[Music]
i'm dr mike this is jared feather and
i'm not really sure who this is but
jared feather does so jared
this is my client
dr liz griffin who is a veterinarian
actually she's four weeks out from her
second third show second show her second
show uh we're going to be doing an upper
emphasis session today she's actually
just starting off her messa cycle we're
gonna be pushing her a little harder
than normal for a week one but again
she's close to show she has three weeks
of hard training and then a week at
delos so this first week most of this
gonna be two in the tank pretty hard
session volume is gonna be a little
higher than normal because she's in her
last missile cycle before the show
so we're gonna get to it
[Music]
yo
yo
yo
yo i'm not actually a rapper but i rap a
little bit but right now i'm not rapping
i am describing the first exercise
high incline neutral grip dumbbell press
in order to take the compound pressing
movement focus on the upper chest and
also bonus round some more front delts
from that neutral grip and that high
position
great way to start makes sense in the
context of her weekly plan so is this
better than regular no it's just a
variation to slightly target the upper
chest even more the lower and mid chest
even less and the front delts more this
is figure front delts are important
you've got to stand out with them big
front belts and a lot of these girls
don't train their chest a whole lot
especially lower chest because that's
not really rewarded in a figure
can distract from a physique so how do
we hit the front delts and the upper
packs which are super important to
figure well exactly this way so let's
get them done multiple sets of probably
five to 15 repetitions remember control
on the way down explode under control on
the way up let's go train
now
let's go
yep good
[Music]
excellent excellent
technique the control is stellar
one last one left slow
good technique big push
go go go go go go go lock it out lock it
and then slow down
that's it
that's it
smith machine shoulder press is up next
more front delt work a bit more tricep
work even a bit of upper chest more
volume for the front belts which are
very very important for a figure athlete
if you're not competitive in figure
usually a ton of the pressing you do
will be totally fine for front belts you
don't have to do a lot for them maybe
nothing
but because finger girls don't really
train their chest a whole lot they need
more passive volume now one thing you'll
notice here
is we use the short cut off mini chair
so that she can lean back and arch into
the movement if you use the standard
actually if you could pan over real
quick scott
if we're using this guy here the problem
here is
if you sit on it
you can't move your head back you can't
move your chest back so the barbell
comes to here or to here and it's really
weird but if you sit on the short chair
and it's here you can arch into the
movement and get an awesome range of
motion and it actually feels way better
for your shoulder joints so if you're
doing smith machine overhead press great
movement try to get one of the mini
chairs it'll work a lot better
excellent
good
[Music]
good stop
last one
press press press
three sets here
two sets so we're done
[Music]
next up is a giant set also called a
marathon set of pull downs where she's
going to be trying to do a sum total of
45 reps with proper rest between mini
sets to try to get to that rep total so
it's an awesome way actually to focus on
the movement qualities and make sure
every rep is perfect because you don't
have to hit certain numbers because if
you're trying to hit certain numbers
like you have to hit 15 this time
because you hit 14 last time some of the
reps might get funky and your mind
muscle connection might go just to hit
that goal with these the total is 45 you
can take all the time you need and the
sets don't have to be a certain amount
so you can really focus on the quality
of every single repetition oh yeah let's
go
[Music]
stretch take the time
there you go
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
good enough
oh yeah
that shit liz chest high high
better
two more
that's it touch
oh that's it
one
big chest you gotta touch
big chest
[Music]
slow
there you go
don't do that come on push it up
that's good wreck
shake it out
and we'll finish off
yes
[Music]
stretch all the way up
there you go
ah that's it
how many is that total
45 35 45 45 so where's that no put it
down two more
two more look up for those last shitty
ones yeah
big chest
good tactician
do not do this
chest to the bar
full stretch all the way up let it pull
you not down
better good rack
[Music]
rose
it's uh any kind of row is the option
today on her program we're choosing
machine rose because the setup here at
dragon's lair is actually really really
awesome it's a great machine made by
matrix equipment it probably costs like
a zillion dollars but boy is it worth it
amazing force curve remember on rows
it's very easy to keep the weight around
and not actually get the back to do a
lot of the work
rows are not about your hips they're not
about how much weight you can do it's
about how much weight you can do
perfectly with a huge protraction of the
front end and a huge retraction on the
back end three cents 10 to 20 reps let's
get it done
oh jesse
up top
chest stop there you go
let it fool you come on
[Music]
oh yeah
convincing hold at the top
big chest

big chest

let's go
oh yeah
[Music]
excellent can you do barbell curls yeah
let's go and curl the spot rack
[Music]
all right folks so last exercise of the
day is curls for the biceps this time
we're doing them jared feather style
which means i can't do this because my
pecs are too big
you put your elbows in your hips you
keep your hurl outside
and you come up to your face and as you
come up you bring your elbows closer
together this really isolates the biceps
seemingly and doesn't involve a whole
lot of other forearm flexors as much
it's at least something for you to try
to see how it feels
three sets here sets of oh five to 15
reps
let's give it a shot there you go
[Music]
lower from right there lower right there
do not push your elbows back
[Music]
elbows stay right here
down
down
a little harder
don't don't you don't use your no hips
and your body arms elbows
biceps arms only
yeah
it's a little harder
it's supposed to be hard though okay
keep your elbows forward don't use your
body
[Music]
one more good technique no hips we only
count the good ones biceps up
[Music]
good
then down slow
that's it
good
slow

[Music]
solid very solid folks
liz that was a great excellent awesome
workout
jared any thoughts yeah
she can push she can push herself very
very hard yeah first time i got to see
her in person train so
i was impressed i might have been
impressed a little bit how was it how
was the workout
it was worth flying out for it was worth
flying out for
folks
one thing liz can do for you
completely on the books totally legit
is if your pet is getting older to the
point where you think it's gonna die
soon she can cybernetically enhance the
pet to make it continue to love you that
loves a trademark for the ai they use to
replicate love that it first just has to
go serve the united states military for
two or three years to be a special
operations agent pet but then it comes
back to you and it's like wow
this is like robot noises but also stole
your cat anyway thanks so much for what
you do for our country with running our
pet robot psycho killer division uh
thank you so much for coming out and
we'll look forward to having you next
time when you're even more jacked sound
good sound good all right see you guys
later
