strength training myths video number
seven
a method has strong lifters or a gym has
strong lifters
i should train just like that method or
jim
says that's the myth i'm dr mike
kuznettal for renaissance periodization
let's dig in to this myth and make sure
we get the right stuff out of it and not
the wrong stuff we're going to talk
about the claim being
uh made specifically i'll bring up
actual specifics
we're going to talk about what success
by a gym or a group of people or
training method actually tells us we're
going to talk about what their success
may not be telling us or for sure
doesn't tell us i'm going to talk about
what the best approach is
if you're presented with very successful
methods seemingly
how to best go about doing them if we're
not going to be copying them wholesale
so claims
for example this is the kind of claim
we're talking about
you know the bulgarians produce tons of
champions
bulgarian weightlifting is legendary in
late 80s so i'm gonna do a bulgarian
split
okay seems like fine reasoning but
something's kind of missing
a super popular one from about 10 or 15
years ago is
westside barbell westside has the most
world records so i'm going to do west
side because obviously they know their
shit
some truth to that something may be
missing as well and
generally the myth here or the idea
which we'll say is at least in part
mythical
is that when a gym or a place or a group
of people is getting really great
results
you should be copying their training
processes so that you get those results
too
and a lot of times the gyms that come up
in ascendancy the ones that talked about
motion on social media have the most
high profile lifters breaking records at
the time
they change right and as they change
so does the fraction of the population
copying them
back in you know between i would say
2000 and
2008 like if you were a power lifter
west side was it are you either copying
west side or people thought you were
some some form of fucking stupid
because clearly they were the best and
onto something really special
and then later it was like constantine
konstantinovs kind of stuff
and then later you know there was errors
of a bunch of like the
best raw lifter coming up and everyone
wanted to know what does this guy do i
want to know what this guy or
this gym has three top guys what do they
do and he's always looking for that
extra special spice there is something
to that
but there's also something not to that
so let's get into that
what does success tell us about an
individual or a method or a gym
when they're getting a lot of success it
tells us that they are on to
something for sure right
and whatever they're on to
how their training is and it might not
be that they're under training
we'll get to that in a second but
whatever they're doing in totality
and their training in specific isn't so
bad as to just be ruled out
of consideration altogether for example
you know west side training may not be
ideal for raw lifters
i think a lot of people sort of start to
catch on to that but it's not so bad
as to make people so weak that they're
never represented among the top 50
lifters in america or something like
that
is you know if the if west side was a
gym with balloons and bosu balls and
pink dumbbells that went up to five
pounds
it doesn't matter how much gear they
took or how much gear they put on their
bodies
they would just never amount to shit so
fundamentally you know
if a gym is successful or a person is
successful whatever training they're
doing
at least isn't awful at least isn't
awful but
you also know they're doing a lot of
other stuff that for some reason are
doing or being
other stuff we'll get to that a sec just
make them successful but you can't quite
be sure what
part of that is the training why can't
you be sure of that
that's point three of what success
doesn't tell us
when people are successful it is
fundamental attribution error
statistical fallacy or sort of misguided
approach
for us to assume we know what part of
the multifactorial
inputs are actually responsible for
their better strength
a lot of these things contribute at the
same time some of them go across
currents to each other
here's an example when folks are
successful when you see strong people
let's say at a strong gym
okay just a lot of people from that gym
or from that association or something
really just super super strong maybe
some coaches producing a lot of athletes
producing
that are super super strong you think
okay it's the way the coach is training
maybe
but here are some other possibilities
first the genetics of the population in
general
that's being trained can be above
average okay i don't know if you guys
have ever been to bulgaria i haven't
but russians think bulgarians are strong
like in general
those memes about like russian woman
fights bear bulgarian woman fights like
a fucking werewolf or some shit like
that
bulgarians are just fucking stout
fucking people man
they're fucking just you don't want to
run into them in a street fight or
anything
else if you start with bulgarians you
apply
some hard training they'll be fucking
amazing right
um mark my words as nigeria's economy
continues to improve and hopefully it
will for the next 20 or 30 years
you're going to see the development of
more of a leisure class like we have in
america it's not really a leisure class
middle true middle class
they're gonna have more time to devote
to sports nigerians will start winning
at all kinds of sports because nigerians
are fucking
elite genetically gifted gods because
all the world people and the nigerians
are right here
you're gonna wonder there's gonna be a
gym somewhere in
uh you know nigeria and lagos or
something that's gonna produce like
you know like three top ten olympians
per year and bodybuilding gonna be like
what are they doing over there
maybe some cool shit maybe some stuff to
really pay attention to but maybe
they're just fucking nigerian right
there's a thing to that okay the
population itself that you're
considering is important but it gets
more complicated
recruitment okay at the zenith of west
side
louis would personally invite some of
the most gifted lifters from across the
united states
to come stay at west side train at west
side be west side
break records for west side do west side
methods have merit fuck yeah of course
they do
do they have their downsides of course
they do would the lifters have gotten
strong everywhere else that they trained
yeah totally
did they get really strong on west side
in part because they physically just
were transplanted and moved to west side
they would have gotten just as good
somewhere else in many cases that's
probably true
now did westside push a really hardcore
mentality push hardcore drug use of
course and that definitely helped
but starting out with guys that squatted
800 before they ever showed up to west
side it's fucking sweet
you know why does your gym in cleveland
ohio with three old ladies
training have only one guy that squats
over 400 pounds and west side has like
nobody squats under
600. well they didn't come there by
chance those people aren't just from
columbus ohio where westline is located
they're from all over recruitments a
real big deal
so this happens a lot in bodybuilding
for example there's oh man this guy's a
top coach
like right on well when one of your guys
wins the olympia or places top 10
your ability to recruit or attract high
level talent
skyrockets and all of a sudden you get
inquiries about people
or buy people that are just already
really fucking good i'm watching this
happen physically right now with jared
feather jared feather before he got his
pro card you know he trained a couple
pros especially ifbb pros he for sure
did
he had great results with him literally
the week after he turned pro
he got like an order of magnitude more
inquiries about can people train him
and this is what's from ifb pros who it
makes sense
in their mind like if they're pros
they're only hiring other pros or above
or the coaches that coach them
and if you're not if you probably have
to kind of look down and you're like
yeah good luck
you know but when you're on their level
they're like oh wait you're on the level
and you fucking super smart sciency guy
you know what the fuck is going on you
prep other people you're really good
come help me but that all essentially
means like you know
does jared feather really know what he's
doing i for sure think he does but
other folks in that industry may not
know a ton about what they're doing and
their training methods may not be that
great
but when even by random chance or
genetic freakiness you had a guy place
top 10 in the olympia or something like
that
you're just going to get a high level of
talent high level talent does high level
talent shit they're fucking good
and then it turns out that that's just
like what ends up happening and that
yeah it happens in the bodybuilding
world of time it happens in the
strengthening world all the time
number three drugs i mean i'm not going
to believe at this point because you
have to be like 12 years old and
understand what the fuck's going on
but you know west side is known
for unreal doses people have left left
side before because they couldn't handle
the drug doses
okay and that happens not only to west
side but many other gyms
strength gyms bodybuilding gyms you name
it it's a thing
so when you're deifying this one
particular athlete that you think is
amazing like
i want to know what his training method
is he's just the only guy who happens to
have the kind of
genetic composition that allows him to
shoot eight grams of gear a week
and not die and that's why he's super
good with pretty good genetics and
unreal gear tolerance how do you know
it's not that how do you know it's a
training method
you don't right which is why we're
laying some skepticism here
another factor nutrition recovery and
lifestyle diligence so one of the things
about bulgarian training centers and in
fact about russian training centers
is when the olympics or world
championships were coming up
all the athletes would live essentially
dormitory style
in a training center they got massages
they got all their food made for them
they had no other chores nothing to do
except
two things train and recover and that's
it now maybe their methods are really
sweet turns out the bulgarian method was
kind of fucking stupid
google max ada bulgarian method and
you'll get
infinite number of web page hits of max
describing he's one of the best
weightlifting coaches in the united
states probably the best
um describing and he did the bulgarian
method for
years studied under the guy who more or
less invented it abhojev
lived with him physically and he'll tell
you why it's not the greatest method in
the world
as a training method but look like when
you let's talk about bulgaria real quick
genetics of population in general
fucking pretty sweet being bulgarian is
awesome
recruitment well the bulgarian national
you know training center recruits all
the best weight lifters from all the
little clubs in bulgaria so amazing
uh drugs they took all the drugs all the
drugs
and nutrition recovery lifestyle
diligence was like basically as good as
it could possibly be
i mean you physically have dick else to
do except get massages eat food
take naps sleep nine hours a night and
lift weights as hard as you possibly can
that shit works for everyone okay and if
you're looking at like it was the
fucking max singles
was it really though you know russia
produced just as many championships
except they almost never did max singles
but they had all the other shit in place
so it makes you wonder right
another one number five this one's
really gnarly a bit of a dark side
survivor bias okay if you make
a training program which is a bench
press program
it relies on accentuated eccentric
loading
so basically like you load more than
your 100 max onto the bench bar
you have serious spotters you try to
resist
crushing you and then they take some
weight off and you press it on the way
up does a training method like that work
in context yes it's very powerful it can
make you very strong the problem is
a lot of eccentric overloading done too
frequently
parses lifters out into two groups the
genetically elite
especially injury risk wise that don't
get hurt and go on to
win bench press worlds in the ipf and
another group
which tear their pecs off and just get
hurt and no one's ever because no one's
ever seen them again
it is my understanding that as soon as
you have a major rupture of the
pectoralis tendon
you never bench properly ever again
like you never go back to benching what
you used to it just never happens that
the repair process just is not that good
yet so
when you're looking at guys you could be
like oh my god the eccentric accentuated
loading
team or gym or training method has
produced all these fucking crazy
champions
i want to try it hold on a sec you may
not survive that process what if i told
you at a 50 50 chance
of either benching 600 pounds or tearing
a fucking peck off the bone
i don't know man 50 50 is rough like i
like benching 600 pounds as much as the
next guy you know until i wake up from
that dream
but 50 50 chance of having a permanent
deformity i don't need any of that shit
right
and survivorship bias to use the
bulgarian example is fucking huge
like a lot of people just couldn't
handle a bulgarian training center thing
a lot of them just got hurt and when you
got hurt in a bulgarian training center
yeah they tried to fix you up a little
bit but
someone replaced you in the varsity spot
for your weight class
and then if you didn't recover properly
you were just kind of kicked to the
wayside
fucking communist government you're just
cogging the machine to them so
survivorship bias is nasty
in fact the bulgarian system
was not intentionally designed this way
but what it ends up being is a weirder
system a weirder program not joe weeder
but w-e-e-d that kind of weed it's like
a bio
biochem class in college if you want to
be a doctor you got to pass that shit
and half the people that try don't pass
it and probably good because they can go
do other stuff and
maybe they're talented in other ways but
sure as hell isn't a biochem and we want
the best doctors we need to weed out to
people that just can't have a
super complex biological concept same
way in bulgaria
in that training method like if you
couldn't survive the volume and
intensity which is fucking obscene
then you were just gone and goodbye so
it was a huge survivor bias issue
and that's just how it worked the thing
is it's fine for a national i mean like
mildly immoral but fine for a communist
government
to to sort of put the tip of the spear
of their best athletes like that
it's a fine strategy uh what about if
you're choosing like if you're free to
choose your own training strategy which
everyone watching this video
pretty much is why would you choose a
weirder strategy
you don't want to weed yourself out you
want to give yourself the best chances
you want a long-term development
strategy
may not be one of these and
lastly we got to be a little bit
skeptical here
is perception okay do folks
really have a higher rate of champions
are they just good about the pr
for the champions they do have if you
have
one major champion at your gym or your
training method and some other people
that are pretty strong
if you leverage that champion enough
they do tons of youtubes podcasts
appearances
training videos other lifters and they
bring a couple of other not as strong
people with them and they're sort of
around there's instagram buzz
it can be like man that one gym in
fucking north carolina whatever i'm just
making shit up
they got fucking tons of great guys and
if you ever sit down to think about it
like
yeah they have that andrews guy i guess
that's kind of it
huh but like because they do their pr
well it could seem like man this is a
real fucking monolith and the gym itself
or the training method
may have its own instagram page and have
lots of followers because that one
lifter
man they're really doing something like
that one gym and you think about if that
one guy gets hurt
they're fucking done so you bought these
training programs from them or copied
their training programs
when really it was just based on one guy
another version of this which is a
little bit
more underhanded unfortunately is
when uh west side at the end of its
zenith
for many years after possibly still to
this day uh
louis simmons will say like oh like we
have the most champions we have the most
champions
except they have the most champions in
equip lifting which almost no one does
anymore
and they have almost no or no champions
in raw lifting
and that's all of lifting now or 99 of
it so when louis says like we have the
most
squat world record holders and our
lifters all squad over 900 like
in equipment they do which is super
impressive but not the same thing as
squatting 900 raw
you know so it's like you used to have
all the champions good pr
can carry your gym a long time even
after the point of which its training
methods have been shown to be
not as great as maybe some others so
there's a lot there right
taking all that together what is the
best approach
because we just leveled a fuckload of
skepticism maybe even cynicism
at the idea of success however there is
a lot there
first you should always be learning
elements
of an approach not copying it wholesale
if you like the bulgarian approach that
doesn't mean you only do the snatch the
cleaner jerk
and the back squat and front squat or
even snatch cleaner jerk and by some
accounts only front squat
you don't just do that every day six
days a week
to a one rep max and that's it what you
can do is take the element out the
higher relative efforts and higher
relative intensities that is to say
trying really hard and going to a max
and also not just a rep max but a one
rep max
seem to have an element perhaps that
makes people really strong
so currently i do like an average of
sets of five
and i do it maybe twice a week what i
could do
is sets of two or three three times a
week
but a little bit less volume to make up
for it that makes your current approach
which you know is good that you know
it's sustainable because it's currently
not fucking up and it works somewhat
it makes it more bulgarian try that and
see if it works and if it works maybe
you can make it even more bulgarian and
then find out that that fucks you up and
gets you hurt so you go back
to some kind of happy medium elements
are great
not wholesale when you do
take elements out of a successful gym's
philosophy which you should be doing
which is why it's a good idea to pay
attention to successful stuff because
you can know like oh wow like
they're really maybe onto something let
me play with this element when you do
actually employ these elements don't
expect a revolution
always and everywhere for non-beginners
and non-genetic freaks
an alteration of your training method
will result in marginal improvements in
your gains
i there may be few other statements that
i think are more important for folks to
hear
that are in their beginner intermediate
phases and have high hopes for their
strength careers
tons of people watching this channel no
doubt are going to get fucking super
strong and that's awesome
but hopefully i wish someone had told me
this shit back in my early days
is when you find that training
philosophy that clicks much
more you're going to gain maybe 10
pounds
on your squat every two months as
opposed to having gained
five or seven and a half there is no
training method or
i'll put it more more technically there
is wildly unlikely to be a training
method
that takes you from no gains or two and
a half pounds
on your squat every two months to one
that goes like to 40 or 50 pounds
people always think like man those
fucking bulgarians if i just do that
bulgarian method
i'll just be bulgarian and everything
will be great
probably not but look if you're used to
gaining five pounds every two months and
now you're getting 10. that's fucking
awesome that's doubling your gains
yeah it's only five pounds more of a
month that shit adds up if you expect
that
kind of good decent but marginal
improvement
look you go a little bulgarian you add a
little this you take away a little that
you alter your shit
and three four five years in a row these
alterations keep your rate of gains
essentially almost at your beginner rate
that's amazing versus if you never made
any alterations it kind of goes like
that and then it
sort of mostly gets asymptotic mostly
flat lines it's definitely good to make
changes just don't expect them to be
this crazy revolution and say oh fuck
that didn't work back to the drawing
board maybe it worked but just a little
bit
that's fine and that's super realistic
lastly
and i kind of just hinted at this don't
just copy shit develop your own methods
yes play with methods and ideas that you
see all through instagram all through
youtube all the different gyms lifters
associations etc and even different
countries
but try them one at a time
integrate them in a way that you think
is the best way to integrate them the
thing that makes logically the most
sense based on what you know and how
your body responds
it's like if someone's doing a lot of
singles maybe add in a few singles don't
just replace your program with singles
because
probably a stupid idea and at the end of
the day
you're gonna get a combination of
methods that's best for you
for your best development which may not
look like somebody else's program
and is almost certainly not going to
look like your favorite lifters program
who you initially got some of those
messes from
that lifter has the program but that
program is tailored to their genetics
their lifestyle etc etc etc
your program can look pretty similar but
should be different because it's
tailored to your differences
because you're not the same fucking
person folks thank you for tuning in
see you next time
you
