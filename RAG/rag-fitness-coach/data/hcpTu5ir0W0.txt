hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization did you know that if you
eat a lot of fats it turns your body
into a fat burning machine
oh wait
as arnold would no doubt say come on
don't bullshit me well all right arnold
stay calm we'll stop and we'll explain
why it's bullshit so point number one
out of four
oh boy this is an awkward point
it's actually true
eating a crapload of fat will absolutely
make your body a fat burning machine
however point number two clarifies what
that actually means
your body is burning mostly the fats
that you're eating
not your own body fat
if you eat a crap load of fats
your body burns those fats as needed
but as long as you have at least your
maintenance calories
all fat coming in
that's the fat that gets burned
and the fat
on your body that you're trying to lose
is not getting burned
because why would it you're bringing all
the fat from another source and your
body's at maintenance calories
so
because eating a ton of fat does make
you a fat burning machine but only throw
the fat that you're eating in
eating high fat will not make you any
leaner any less fat
then the calorie balance determines
if you eat here's your maintenance
calories what it takes to maintain your
body weight if you eat at a surplus high
fat low fat doesn't matter you usually
gain weight if you eat at maintenance
you could be almost all your diet is
from fats and people like oh my god that
guy's going to blow up and get insane
eating fucking bacon with peanut butter
on it if you just eat a maintenance
you'll probably gain pretty close to no
fat or no fat at all
if you are below maintenance and you are
hypocaloric you can again slather peanut
butter on bacon and jam it in and you
will lose fat in most cases that entire
time because calorie balance is king
and we don't have to worry about which
macronutrients larger than we eat with a
little bit of an exception we probably
want to have a decent amount of protein
to spare some muscle loss and a good
amount of carbs is great to fuel your
brain so you can think through the day
and fuel you for activity and for
recovery from training and then after
you've met those minimum needs for
proteins and carbs to checklist to
making sure you have muscle and have an
energy for the day in your workouts you
can eat as much fat as goes up to your
maintenance calories and not worry about
having to gain any fat and at the same
time if you eat lots of fat or very
little fat and you are under your
maintenance calories you will get lean
and it don't have to turn your body into
a fat burning machine by eating more fat
than you may like
so
if burning your own body fat is the goal
thinking you have to eat a ton of fat to
turn yourself into a fat burning furnace
is
bullshit
although thinking of yourself as a
furnace is kind of sweet imagine you're
like 18 feet tall
two tons and you're like furnace man
we'd have to
brainstorm the name that's not that
great but like you're like there's
inside your eyes are red because inside
here's all furnace i have no idea how
the
the logic works or how what's generating
movement it's all furnace right but then
like when superheroes run up to you and
they're like hey you got to stop
destroying the city you're just like
bruh
and furnace heat comes out they're like
ah and you know they hit a car the car
blows up uh
anyway
scott the video guy should we start a uh
gofundme for a movie project a furnace
man
furnace man furnace man if he can't do
it
many other people no doubt can see you
next time
unless it's he actually still fits
furnace man
he's just like with no no the preview is
like a guy burning everything he's 18
feet tall and then the real movie is
like i just shows up to like fix a
furnace but he's really great he's
really cordial yeah he's like puts those
little booties on over his shoes yeah
ooh it could be an adult film where he
shows up to fix the fern and it says
like and then he cleans their pipes
feeling that
