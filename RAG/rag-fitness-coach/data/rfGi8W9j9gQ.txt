hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
do you need mobility work if your goal
is simply to gain muscle
that's the main organizing principle of
your training
let's find out so here's what we're
going to be talking about today
first we're going to define mobility
because a ton of people say mobility of
oh
effing idea what they're talking about
take that youtube algorithm and tries to
ban us by swearing too much number two
we're going to talk about mobility
limitations that actually occur in
hypertrophy training
third we're going to talk about when to
actually work on mobility during perfect
training because there's times you
should and times
probably is not necessary then we're
going to talk about
how to actually improve mobility if you
need to and hypertrophy training the
best methods
and then we're going to talk about quite
numerous number of
fads and follies in the mobility space
not just hypertrophy but all over in all
of sports so here we go
defining mobility so there's a couple
terms get thrown around let's just clear
the air
flexibility is the ability to assume a
wide range of anatomical positions like
you
like do this with your you know splits
like these are feet by the way
i can't do the splits but if you can
like bend your hips all crazy you have a
high degree of flexibility
okay strength is the ability to produce
a high degree of force
okay different concept why the hell we
talking about strength
mobility is the intersection of strength
and flexibility
it is the ability to produce high forces
across a
wide range of anatomical positions so if
you can like
do the splits on a slippery floor and
then stand
up through the splits you have like
god-like mobility okay that that's an
example
able to produce a ton of strength
through high degree of flexibility
because if you take like
like little kids or folks that aren't
super strong but are really skinny a lot
of times their flexibility is impressive
like they can go all the way down on a
dip and then you're like come up and
they're like
nope that doesn't mean they're mobile
because they're actually immobile in
that position but they are very flexible
and you could be really strong but super
bound up and they're like all right
touch the bar to your bed to your chest
in the bench and you're like
i can't right and then we can't say that
you have a high degree of mobility so
mobility is both
the ability to move through large range
of motion and to provide high forces
at all of those ranges right sport
specific
mobility is very important because it's
so different between each sport
sport specific mobility is the ability
to produce the requisite forces the ones
needed for high performance either in
training or competition
through the range of anatomical
degrees typically presented
in sport training competitions for
example
if you can do the splits does that help
you in bodybuilding outside of doing the
splits in your posing routine or
something
no right what about in basketball
also no what about in gymnastics
required
right so different sports are going to
have different degrees of mobility
and thus you're going to train them a
bit differently because like if you can
press a log overhead but you can't even
get a third of the way to the splits
you get to win world's strongest man
potentially if you can't press a log
overhead because you're about that
strong
but you can do crazy splits and come out
of them you might win worlds and
gymnastics right so
sport specific mobility is making sure
you are mobile enough
strong and flexible to do the movements
of your sport
that are present in training and
competition and for hypertrophy we're
talking about specifically training
can you do what it takes do you have the
mobility now
so the exact definition of hypertrophy
training specific mobility is
the ability to produce requisite forces
for stimulative hypertrophy training
in the range of anatomical positions
required for hypertrophy training
okay so if you can like pretzel your arm
behind your back sweet but i've never
seen that exercise
in the gym to get you jacked so no bonus
points there right but
if you can't do a pull-up or a pull-down
because you're so immobile
you know maybe that's a limiting factor
right so
there's fundamentally sort of two ways
this can occur in hypertrophy training
this lack of mobility okay so now we're
talking about a lack of mobility and
perjury training there's two ways that
it can happen
the first is an inability to assume or
maintain
actual training positions so you can't
even get into positions here are some
examples this is not an inclusive list
can't put the bar on your back uh to
back squat okay like your muscles
are so big you're so bound up have such
shitty flexibility or whatever
you can't even put a bar in your back
that happens okay uh it happens to me
so i have to actually grab the bar on
the outsides you may some of you have
maybe seen my training videos
that that has to be the case can't touch
the bar to your clavicles in the
overhead press some people in the
overhead press they stop here and
they're like that's it
pull down like i can't there's stuff
physically in the way okay or they're
just not flexible enough
for other reasons definitely uh an
example there
when you're trying to do your
stiff-legged deadlifts or good mornings
your back rounds just as soon as you try
to hinge at the hips your back starts to
round there's a bunch of different
factors that can be responsible
but that is an inability to maintain or
assume your training position
right and you can't keep your heels down
in a deep squat every time you try to
squat deep
your heels come up okay that's
definitely a problem because you're not
in the right training position it's not
optimally force generating or safe and
then you can't train as well as you
could
now part b the second way you can have
immobility or lack of mobility and
hypertrophy training
is that you can get into pretty extended
positions
large angles in your motion but
you are unable to generate overloading
forces in them you generate some force
but there's a huge drop
off that we just normally wouldn't
expect for that movement for example
if you can do a ton of weight in the
pull-up like this but if we have you
hang all the way down you're like
i can't even do my body weight uh yeah
that's probably a mobility concern
same idea with dips some people can dip
a lot but when they go all the way down
to the dips not like all the way down
hurt your shoulders all the way down but
all the way down
and still feel comfortable and they're
like i got nothing here right that may
be a mobility problem because you're not
able
to generate high forces through the full
range of motion which is how you grow
the most muscle
there's just ranges of motion that are
normal for that exercise and anytime you
get into them
there's a huge fall off it's definitely
something we'll address right
another example there is your weight in
the hack squat
squat or leg press drastically falls
when you do full range of motion
like you're squatting 600 to halfway
down and we have you do full squat
you're squatting like 185
for a set of five and you're like ah
okay we usually don't think that someone
partial squat 600 should be squatting
only 185 for a set of five
uh all the way down something is up and
potentially we can fix it
so now let's find out
when a problem is sort of severe enough
or
is worthy of attention so when to work
on mobility in hypertrophy training
so first let's rule out the problems
that don't require mobility work okay
specific mobility work here we go
first uh situation which does not
require mobility work
your muscle is just too big to get the
rom that you're used to getting
okay like on skull crushers if your arms
and shoulders get big enough
you actually can't move your elbows in
anymore because your pecs are literally
in the way
and you can't get as deep because your
biceps are touching your forearm and
there is no fixing that
okay so don't worry about it it just
happens it's a cool problem to have
because it means you're jacked
but it's just part of the problem if you
guys uh want to go on instagram
uh and follow nicholas vlad no
affiliation he's just a pro bodybuilder
he's like 5'3 and like 240 in his
offseason lean
and i like you look at his training
videos and you're like wow that really
is full range of motion for him
because he's so enormous for his frame
that he can be barely moving tons of
these exercises that we're used to
seeing a high range of motion because no
amount of mobility work that's ever
going to help him
with that specific problem is just shit
in the way and that's it
can't do anything about it right another
concern
so concern number two that you don't
address with mobility work
you're fat okay like i used to have a
problem where my gut was so big i
couldn't get deep leg presses
the problem wasn't that i couldn't get
deep leg presses the problem was my gut
was too big
so i lost some fat and then i got better
all right so if you're pretty over fat
and you know it
uh and you're like i need mobility work
like do you though
do you though maybe you just need to
lose some fat which is always a good
idea for a bunch of other reasons okay
so give that some thought
number well so let me come back real
quick sometimes when you're on a mass
gaining phase and you get a little bit
fat
your mobility declines just know that
like you're not squatting as deep as you
used to because your gut
and and your leg fat is sort of in the
way and that's touching each other
and that's okay it's not something like
what i don't want you guys to do is be
like shit like my mobility's
messed up like i've been gaining weight
and everything's great my strength is
great but like my mobility sucks what
should i do about it like
nothing like you're just gonna get the
mobility back when you
get leaner again it's just part of the
process right
number three reason not to go do
mobility workforce retraining
is you're not using a proper technique
okay a lot of mobility problems are just
doing the exercise wrong
super common people say like oh i can't
get deep on the squat
like two or three minutes of work with
them in real life like take your feet
put them out more
point your toes out sit back and then
sit down okay great you're doing full
squats i'm like
holy shit i thought my ankles weren't
flexible enough like no
you're just putting your feet in the
wrong position and you weren't opening
up your hips popular huh
okay so before you conclude mobility
work is the problem technique
i would say in 80 of all cases actually
fixes
the issues completely so it's almost
always a technique problem
lastly this one's a tough sell but i
feel like most of you will be with me on
this
you're just fucking weak but it's not a
mobility problem it's just not that
strong problem
right uh you you say okay i used to be
able to like press 500 but when i go all
the way down to leg press
i can only leg press 315. like you could
have just
started that statement late and said i
can only leg press 315 because that's
the only thing you can let press
in reality when it's done through full
range of motion you never could let
press 500 you were partially
pressing it which is a huge insult to
you you should cry about it all right
so actually go deep shut up
and take weight off the bar and do what
it takes and then when you actually come
back up
to going super deep and like pressing
500 you're gonna look down your legs but
oh shit i have big quads
fucking miracle right so a lot of times
people are like oh man i don't have a
lot of mobility
i've had folks in real life say this to
me training with me on occasion i'll be
like oh man i can't get deep in the
squad
and then they got like 405 on the squad
i'm like interesting
so we go go back down to the bar and it
turns out they can get deep and we go up
to 225 and they're getting crushed for
sets of 8 with 225 super deep
and they're like oh shit you know i
never had 225 messed me up like this i'm
like ah
and at that point you don't rub it in
their face but they know right and then
hopefully
they just keep going 225 230 to 35 etc
staying deep getting great workouts much
less joint stress and turns out mobility
was never the problem
using too much weight was the problem
however that all
is easy solve problems because you don't
need to do mobility work however there
are some problems
where you do can benefit from mobility
work
right one is you get very limited range
of motion
out of very effective movements and you
want to use those movements like
shoulder presses stiff legged deadlifts
squats
like you tried all the stuff and it
turns out like you really just can't get
the range of motion out of squats but
you're like i need bigger legs damn it
and again the machines are good but like
i'm not going to throw away the king of
all exercises the squat right
for like just because i never tried to
work on my mobility maybe if i fix my
mobility somehow we'll get to how in a
bit
maybe i can squat that would be great
right stiff legged deadlifts huge
hamstring builder
i would i would surmise that there's not
a number of leg
curls in the world you can do to
optimize your hamstring size unless you
do also some kind of hip hinge like
heavy good mornings having uh stiff
legged deadlifts etc if you can't do
good mornings it's stiff lego dollars
because of lower back mobility issues
it's worth exploring the mobility front
because you could be missing out on a
great exercise
and i'll have a story for you guys later
i've actually done that before
to myself with a great degree of success
and another reason which may require
mobility work is
you seem to have trouble coordinating
movement uh at a very deep position in
the movement or very extended position
and it drops your stability and force
production a lot like you can do dips
pretty far down and do like some hanging
weight and a lot of reps
when you do dips to the to all the way
down no pain in your shoulders or
anything you're just like
wait your strength is way down way down
and that's usually
um something you may be able to fix and
thus you can maximize your range of
motion
maximize how much tension is produced at
the stretch position which again is a
huge hypertrophic stimulus
all these great things happen and all
you had to do was sort of focus on the
mobility work and not just be like ah
i'm just going to accept this all right
so
what are the best mobility approaches to
hypertrophy training
now that we let's say we have identified
that mobility really is a limiting
factor on something
and we want to change it there are three
good approaches at least
right that can
increase our mobility it's going to take
a little while and some of these are not
magic
and you're gonna look at them and be
like god damn it why did i watch a video
about this obvious shit
sometimes shit is obvious all right
number one
incrementally doing slightly more range
of motion with great technique over the
weeks and weeks weeks of training so for
example
last month you did stiff-legged
deadlifts to a six-inch block
okay six inches above the ground is
where you stop the lift with good
technique
you know your back is nice and flat your
knees are back etc you feel it's a hip
hinge you're feeling your hands
this month you go to a five-inch block
and at first it feels kind of weird and
like your your technique is almost
perfect but a little bit rounded
and then at the end of the month the
five inch block feels amazing and you
feel super flexible and it feels like
really strong
and then maybe two months later you go
to a four inch block and so on and so on
right eventually you'll end up much more
flexible
than you ever were and because you're
training strength through that range
you'll be strong at all those ranges too
right i did this with good mornings
stiff like deadlifts and bent over rows
because i wanted to have a tight back
for bent over rows when i started doing
stiff-legged deadlifts uh good mornings
i did later
stiff-legged deadlifts and bent over
rows i literally
the lowest i could get before my lower
back started around was the bar hanging
at my knees no lower like it's insulting
because i was almost completely upright
i was like well that's it
and i didn't try to just go to the
ground and round my back slowly over
time i tried to go a little deeper a
little deeper a little deeper set up
some blocks a little deeper
and after a while i was with a
completely tight back doing stiff legged
deadlifts and rows
to if we had 45s on the bar what would
be below the floor so i had to stand a
deficit or put 25s on the bar
something like that mission accomplished
and i grew a ton of muscle on that way
and over the time because i didn't have
to use much more weight as the range of
motion
increase the the actual forces to the
muscle then i was able to
make sure that i didn't get hurt really
really good it works i promise i've done
it before
does it take patience of course it does
but it's also a pretty permanent fix
like once you're down there and you're
practicing those movements
never a problem again and ben best part
you get to do it while you're training
so it's no extra work if you're just
still growing muscle
it's just the way you're going about it
also improves your mobility
and last bonus point because your
mobility was kind of a limiting factor
for how much you got out of the
exercises
if you're slowly incrementally improving
your mobility you're actually getting
more and more and more of the exercises
all the time eventually when you're
stiff like a deadlifting like you start
stuff like a deadlifting and with a
tight back you can only go to your knees
i get the movement stimulus to fatigue
ratio is like
fine it's fine uh when you're still like
another thing all the way to the ground
with 45 pound plates or even lower
oh my god like two or three sets of that
lights your hamstrings up like crazy
right so it turns into a better and
better movement the longer you do
number two strategy pause
at the bottom position of a lift where
you have a mobility problem
and milk the shit out of it so what you
do is stay super tight in the core
and all of the joints that aren't
supposed to be moving okay so if you're
pausing at the bottom of a squat
your shoulders are retracted your core
super tight you're not like
you don't pause and just die at the
bottom and wilt like a flower everything
stays nice and upright nice and rigid
okay and then you let the moving joints
like the knees and the hips and the
squat for example
sink a little bit deeper over two to
four seconds
so it's not pause it's pausing milk so
you go all the way down in the squat to
where you can your heels are still on
the ground
you sit there and you kind of just you
don't stay super tight everywhere
except for the knees and the hips which
is sort of let it sink and remember
that's like 200 pounds on your body or
whatever
you're gonna sink okay let it sink you
like slowly just relax your quads and
glutes a little bit
let the sink happen about two or four
seconds and then come up
okay this works great in a bunch of
lifts some of the notable examples
dumbbell presses you go down
and back up and then down sing sing
sing sync and back up something like
that leg presses it works great
squats dips so on and so forth tons of
movements right
do you want to do this first as a first
exercise maybe not because you want
first exercise the muscle group to be
super hardcore super high force focused
on performance
maybe do that for your first exercise
and for your second exercise
pick a movement you want to work on your
mobility for but that also taxes the
muscle
and then do this method for the second
movement
and then over time your mobility is
going to expand you're going to grow
more muscle and then everything is going
to be great so great
that you can use that second movement
you used to have mobility problems with
as a first movement so for example maybe
start your workout
with a flat bench press okay no mobility
issues because you can touch the bar you
come all the way up no problem
the second uh exercise maybe is an
incline dumbbell press and you have some
mobility problems
then use the two to four second sync
method and then after three or three
months you can dumbbell press through a
really crazy through full range of
motion and maybe that's your first
exercise now
or it's just a normal exercise that
doesn't have the problem anymore right
good news this also makes you grow over
time so there's
no extra work to be done and you get
benefits the whole time also
you can get pretty really good stimulus
just doing that alone
okay two to four seconds sunk at the
bottom is just independently stretch
under load it's awesome
you could just do this normally through
training
number three last way to improve
mobility
is practicing if you target a few not
your whole body for no good goddamn
reason a few targeted
to a specific muscle or movement
mobility drills
three to six times per week okay you can
do these around training it's probably
better if you do them at home
by yourself in a time that's not really
close to before training or after to not
interfere with the recovery adaptive
process get uh
stretching the muscle a lot before
training reduces force output
stretching it a lot after probably
interferes with some hypertrophy
mechanisms through a small
slight small degree so if you if you do
mobility work in the morning when you
wake up maybe you train later in the
afternoon that's
totally super cool you have to do them
often
okay you can't do mobility work once or
twice a week and say you're getting shit
out of it like unless you're doing it
under heavy load like we are in the
first two examples if you're doing just
regular at-home mobility work yoga type
stuff you got to do it real often at
least three times a week
probably more like four or five or six
five to 20 minutes at a time
is all you need and any more than that
is either overkill or just a negatively
really bad idea and it pisses away a lot
of your time
i'm not going to talk about any of these
drills because completely honest with
you guys i don't even fucking know
hardly any of them but there are people
that do
clinical athlete clinical athlete.com
clinical athlete and instagram clinical
athlete on youtube
that's where you go dr quinn haddock is
in charge of that whole thing i believe
super sharp group of folks and they know
their mobility like
get back in front of their hands all
right get on the clinical athlete
find out how to do specific mobility
drills uh they
also have like a pay site situation
where it's like their network where you
sign up and you get all kinds of
exclusive content then you can ask
questions to all the experts
that's a really great idea then if
you're really concerned with mobility
and you want targeted mobility drills
that's where you find out how it works
they have a bunch of manuals all this
really really good stuff
so don't just do random mobility drills
here's who not to follow
for mobility journals like random girl
on instagram who has an ass
and it's like mobility work and it's
just her jumping her ass in the camera
you're gonna learn shit doing that go to
the experts find out and
some of them are quite good looking i
might say hey quinn uh
get into that and practice it
diligently weeks and weeks and weeks
three to six times a week five to twenty
minutes each time the same drills
then you're going to get better and
better and better and your trainings and
improve mobility is
not a potpourri type of thing we like
sometimes just do it and like ah like
hey did you do mobility work this week
like
i skipped it how many times do people
like post their workouts on instagram
like skip mobility work today like sweet
you're gonna be so fucking mobile never
right if it's a problem then do it right
okay
if you want a solution do it right if
it's not a problem it's not in need of a
solution don't do it at all
i don't do mobility work because points
one and two handled everything i ever
needed
right but if i was gonna do number three
i'd probably uh do it pretty diligently
lastly let's talk about a common group
of mobility fads and follies and
fallacies
dumb shit that people say they do for
mobility it doesn't do a whole lot of
anything and sometimes
it hurts number one doing mobility work
for non-problem areas
like i've seen people do like mobility
work for their hips i'm like oh do you
have like
trouble with hip mobility and lifts like
no like why are you doing this work
like uh you know prehab this is just
things prehab
there's no such thing as prehab okay
it's called warming up
where prehab is i think a term invented
by people who just want to make more
money selling you bullshit you don't
need
right real talk number two
foam rollers the motorized dildo thing
you know
that's what it is okay that whole thing
uh
these are pain modulation devices that
can help enhance mobility in the short
term
because they reduce the perception of
pain they're not long-term mobility
enhancers
either you could use them forever which
takes a shitload of time
or you can actually fix the mobility
issue much of the time
with something like we talked about the
actual mobility fixes i'd much rather
see you do that
if you need to do these things to get
into some positions that's okay but i
would seek medical assessment first
to make sure there's nothing funky going
on and or seek some ways to improve your
mobility long term so that you don't
need to rely on these devices nothing
particularly wrong with them it's just
nine times out of ten you could have
fixed the problem instead of just
you know dildo gunning yourself every
time before you do bench
number three if you're taking more than
20 minutes to do mobilization something
seriously wrong with you you need to go
see a medical professional
okay and maybe you're the exception but
you're probably not
okay you're probably just doing way too
much of that stuff it's just the
returns for you or not yielding anything
i've seen people warm up
and do mobility work for 40 minutes
before a 30 minute workout
holy shit like something's up okay
something is definitely up and your your
time efficiency is awful
maybe consider seeing a medical
professional a physical therapist
someone at the clinical athlete website
to ask some pertinent questions about
because what you're doing is not normal
okay
lastly number four and this is super
super common
huge fallacy and fad is to do everything
but the hardship
and what is the hardship humbling
yourself with lighter loads
for higher ranges of motion and in
painful stretch positions
you say like hey here's this fun
mobility drill it's super great
or you could do stiff legged deadlifts
and hold for two to four seconds at the
bottom all your hamstrings tear
most people are like yeah i'm just gonna
go do the fun stuff except the fun stuff
doesn't work most
of the time and the stuff like another
thing works almost all the time
doing consistent low volume mobility
work in your non-gym time people want to
do some kind of weird mobility drill a
new one every day
or like you know a random one once every
week
and they don't want to just put in the
work of figuring out the mobility drills
probably talking to a professional that
they need to be doing doing those
sequentially
often and progressing through them and
then actually accomplishing their task
of enhancing their mobility because
that's hard
right takes dedication takes planning
takes scheduling
and lastly most people don't want to
keep track of range of motion
progressions to keep pushing the pace
right how do you know if your stuff like
a deadlift is improving in mobility if
you've never measured
if you never stiff like a deadlift two
pins or two blocks to see how you're
doing
like hey is your mobility improving like
i don't know it kind of feel better
right it's tough it's annoying to keep
track of stuff but it's going to pay off
in the long term because if you do this
stuff right
you can actually fix most of your
mobility problems and
before we said this before you probably
don't have mobility problems nearly as
much as you thought but the ones you do
have you can fix
forever just doing proper training and a
couple of targeted mobility drills
don't fall for the hype folks
that's all i have to say on the matter
before i upset myself too much
catch you next time for the next video
