so as you're curling instead of staying
here with your elbows down bring your
elbows up and squeeze up here your bicep
actually has a few functions one of them
is to move the shoulder up this way
similar to the front delt some people
say like oh you usually delts as
cheating it's not cheating it actually
uses your bicep and because it shortens
the bicep significantly more it can get
you a crazy Peak contraction once you've
done about a second of squeezing at the
top of wrap you slowly keep that squeeze
and undo it just enough to let the
weight slowly pull you down this can
increase your mind muscle connection
burn the living out of your biceps
and can potentially get you slightly
better results
