hey folks dr mike isratel here again for
renaissance periodization
i suppose when i'm on the channel that's
who i'm going to be repping
today let's talk about effective
versus optimal because i get a ton of
questions
through various forms of social media
and of course youtube
of like hey does the following diet
practice the training practice work
does five by five work does you know
the keto diet work and other questions
of like hey what's
optimal and if i want my best results
what do i do
and a lot of times those are really
really intertwined
and in fact they shouldn't be as
intertwined there's a very big
difference between works
and optimal and we're going to make sure
to try to kind of parse that out and
give you guys some pretty good
recommendations
of how to approach your fitness goals so
first
we're going to define what works means
when someone says like hey like this
works
or it works for me like what exactly
technically
this is a nerdy lecture what do they
mean by works
secondly when people say optimal what
exactly is optimal what is the
difference between works and optimal
and then lastly is kind of the sort of
applied part of the lecture
is can you still do xyz approach
can you still do the diet you want or
the training you wanted where on the
spectrum it lies between works and
optimal
depending on where there's your answer
so let's get right into it
how do we define that something works
it's not a very difficult definition
any in this case we'll just use diet and
training as an example this applies to
almost everything else in life any diet
or training intervention
that produces measurable results in a
certain evaluation period
okay so you're saying okay we're looking
we're going to do this thing
we have this time after we do the thing
to see if it does
anything and any measurable deviation
towards the benefit side
it technically works right now notice
works is a very general concept we're
not saying it works really well
we're not saying it works poorly we're
just saying it works at all
right and here's one of these situations
where works gets muddled and it really
shouldn't and the reason it gets muddled
is because
people of different experience levels
are asking about it
for beginners almost everything works
which is why you have like p90x
ads and all these weird ads for all
these supplements and shakes and meal
replacements and weird workout programs
if you just apply some resistance
training to people if you just apply
some kind of caloric constraint to
people that are beginners
they're going to get leaner they're
going to get bigger they're going to get
stronger so almost everything works
right
for intermediates that's not really the
story for intermediates
some stuff starts to not work so well
and some star
stuff might not really work at all for
intermediates anymore while other stuff
still works either pretty well or to
some extent
lastly for advanced individuals who tend
to be the wisest and most experienced
as well they've been through enough
alterations and iterations of various
things and various
strategies and tactics and products and
solutions they've tried
that they by the time they get very
advanced have
known things to work before but those
things may not work anymore as a matter
of fact for advanced people
maybe most stuff that they try doesn't
actually work
which is to say it doesn't produce
measurable results that takes them
further on the road of where they want
to go
so you know for example if you're a
beginner and you run
like the small off squat routine for
sure you're getting stronger
if you're immediate it depends on your
ability to recover if you
have great genetics or lifestyle for
recovery you're going to get a lot of
small routines going to work really well
if you have poor genetics or lifestyle
for recovery
it may not work for you so like it is
for intermediates sometimes a little bit
more 50 50.
and then for advanced people there's
very few advanced people get anything
out of small off because usually they
can't recover at that rate
they need to radically alter either the
rest of their program or the way they
implement whatever version of small off
they think they're doing
so advanced people are in this sort of
situation where they have to start
looking harder and harder and harder
for the stuff that actually works just
works at all we're not even saying
optimal yet
now what is optimal optimal isn't just
the stuff that works
it's the very best of what works so
optimal is the approach that gets the
most measurable results
during that defined evaluation time
period that we're asking okay did we
lose the fat
three months later after a fat loss diet
how much fat did we lose the program
that gets us the most
possible fat loss is the closest to
optimum
right and optimal is constrained
very very heavily by at least three
things
it is individuality situationality
and chronology so those are real fancy
words let's break that shit down into
simple shit so
first if you have whatever kind of
genetics and whatever kind of training
history
the optimal split for you for example
may be a little bit different than the
optimal splitters for somebody else
because you're a different individual
with a different history
so all of a sudden optimal is not the
same answer for everyone
secondly optimal can be a different
answer based on your situation
you may be in a situation in which you
have four hours a week to train
the optimal split looks very different
than if your situation is one in which
you have eight hours a week to train
because imagine someone writes you the
optimal program it's six hours a week of
training
if you have eight hours to train you
could do more in benefit
or at least take longer breaks between
lifts and benefit
if you train for four hours a week you
only have four hours to train but
someone writes you a six hour program
either you're cramming that shit in so
much it's not optimal anymore or you
don't even do the whole program and it's
for sure not optimal anymore
so the situation definitely matters and
people even for the same genetics and
training history situations can change
thus optimal can change and it depends
on
your chronology so if you want to say
get as jacked as possible
within a year let's say you have a
really big you're an actor let's pretend
uh maybe you are an actor who knows i
can't judge the viewer if you're an
actor and you have this
mega role coming up and filming starts
in a year
you need to get as jacked and lean as
possible what's optimal for you to do
that whole rest of the year may be very
different
than what's optimal for someone that for
example has a 10-year time horizon if i
want to be the best bodybuilder i can be
in 10 years
just as a quick example if someone wants
to be the best bodybuilder they can be
in 10 years
two things come to mind instantly one
they do tons of compound hardcore heavy
moves for the first year
very little isolation work very little
small muscle group work
because who gives a shit you're supposed
to build the basic foundation before you
get into that stuff
and for that person who has a 10-year
time horizon optimal may mean
either very limited mini cutting or
almost no cutting at all just straight
gaining for a year slow and steady gain
is probably the best way even just
maintaining and building up muscle
reducing fat
or just gaining is a real good idea
whereas if your job is to become jacked
and lean
and you have a year to do it like a good
fraction of that year
probably towards the tail end last three
or four months maybe even last five or
six
is going to be cutting and only the
first part is going to be gaining
so if your training partner is someone
who has a role in hollywood in a year
that they have to be as jacked and lean
as possible
for and you just started training with
them but your goal is to be as good as
you can
jacked and lean wise in 10 years you're
going to bifurcate real quick
and nobody can say like well what
shouldn't you both be doing the optimal
program
well that's a very different program
because you're in a different chronology
of when you want to peak
so that's optimal now
what is the difference between optimal
and what works and for this i'd like to
bring your attention
to this chart that you're seeing there
this is my artistry i was trained
not only you guys already know i was
formally trained in cuisine that's what
we chefs call cooking
and i was also trained in juilliard
we'll say
as an artist so here's my art and it's
all a spectrum
what works is on the right hand side of
that spectrum
and works goes all the way from just
north of pointless
which is to say doesn't work at all but
doesn't hurt you
all the way through pretty effective
like works pretty well all the way and
ends at optimal
however that spectrum for just sort of
full learning experience here
goes the other way too because not
everything you do is at worst
pointless some things actually make you
quite a bit worse if you do them
and other things are maximally
regressive which means they make you
whatever it is you want they make you as
bad as possible
at it quick example because this is all
theoretical
let's say we have fat loss okay
at the tail end on the very left hand
side what's the worst possible thing you
can do
for fat loss and remember worse is
negative it's not just no fat loss
fat gain so if you stuff yourself every
hour of just as much junk as you can eat
that's the maximally regressive thing to
do as far as a fat loss diet
program okay on the training side of
course you wouldn't be moving at all but
we're not talking about training
just diet just stuff yourself every hour
with snack cakes and potato chips
and you'll be as fat as possible and
that's as worse as you can get
on the other hand sort of towards the
middle of bad still that negative
is doing a crappy fad diet burning out
rebounding and gaining some fat lots of
people do this
very few people try to lose fat by
stuffing themselves every hour
but plenty of people try to lose fat
with stupid diets they get crazy hungry
crazy burnt out have no recourse
at all towards what a sustainable
dieting practice looks like and just go
back to shitty habits and get even
fatter okay so that's
not the worst that can happen because
it's not going to make you as fat as
possible but it sure is going to make
you fatter than you were so it's kind of
in the middle of that left side of the
spectrum
in the middle is pointless which is
something like a body wrap
like if you do body wraps or whatever or
someone wraps you up and they're like
this is soaked with tea leaves and
really drains the chi out of you or
whatever fucking somehow makes you
leaner
it fucking doesn't do that at all but
short of like costing you whatever how
much money it costs
it doesn't make you fatter i sure as
hell hope not that would be a nasty
discovery
so body wraps will make you fatter they
don't make you any better so it's
pointless right there in the middle
and then of course there we've now
entered just north of pointless we've
entered into things that actually work
now all things work equally so if you do
pure if it's your macros it's a great
way to go
about things but you miss out on some
details so it's not the optimal way
if you do pure clean eating there's
brown rice chicken and broccoli or
whatever
you miss out on some some opportunities
to lose some fat but
it works pretty well so that's kind of
sort of step one if like works decently
then things that work really well is
like evidence-based dining practices all
the stuff you learn on this channel
jeff nippert's channel all the other
awesome youtube channels and and
all the other uh ways you can learn and
buy textbooks and stuff and if you're
really good at science and you're really
good at dieting practice you fuse those
together
you get an awesome approach that really
just checks all the boxes and then
optimal is something far off in the
future future discoveries of
evidence-based dieting practices
that can really really really make you
just lose as much fat as humanly
possible
right as far as diet is concerned so
there's that whole spectrum
notice there's a difference between
works and optimal that we can see kind
of in the real world or even different
degrees of works
someone could say hey i did ifom it
works for me the response isn't like
great that's perfect the response is
actually like that's really good that
you got results
have you considered making your practice
not just if it fits your macros
but a little bit more evidence-based for
example taking in food palatability into
account and satiety
if you took a protein shake and eat a
pop-tart you may be hungry in an hour
if you have some other foods that are
like potatoes
lots of broccoli lots of lean meats that
are hard to chew
if you have that stuff and it's not
crazy flavored super well you may eat
the same calories as the protein shaken
pop tart
technically getting you the same fat
loss goals but you don't get hungry for
four hours
unless you can sustain a lower a bigger
deficit for longer and get even leaner
right so there's different degrees of
works of what works all the way from
just north of pointless
all the way through optimal right
so in the end this theory is all nice
and interesting but
can you still do xyz approach because a
lot of folks will message myself
and renaissance periodization and say
hey i want to do
this diet or i want to do this training
method what do you think
right and so for example to say i like
keto or i like starting strength or i
like you know high intensity training
can i still do it the answer is
definitely yes
as long as you meet two criteria the
first one is
you're okay with the pace of results
okay your starting strength is going to
get you
a certain level of strength and
muscularity and fat loss at a certain
pace if you're okay with that pace
for sure do starting strength second
point is
if you're okay with a potential outcome
of whatever thing you chose
to be less than optimal to potentially
be less than optimal
okay because you're not looking for the
optimal thing you're not
taking cobbling together from various
strategies and making
your best effort at optimal that was is
really likely to get you very very far
but if you're like look i don't really
care so much about optimal i just want
something that works pretty well
i'm okay with the pace of results i'm
getting and i'm totally okay to do keto
i know keto is an optimal but it works
pretty well for me and it's super simple
can i do it well if you're okay with the
pace of results keto gets you
and you're okay with the final outcome
being maybe not the most fat loss maybe
not the best sustainability meaning that
the best final results
do something decent then that's totally
cool and
if at some point you decide that either
one of those points a and b
pace of results or potentially missing
out on stuff
if you think that no longer applies to
you if you want a little bit better
then you have to modify your current
method
which means you have to move on that
spectrum for where wherever that method
works
slightly towards optimal so you may were
you were doing keto
and you realized you know keto is
working well but
my workouts my lifting isn't going so
great i don't have pumps i don't have a
ton of energy
this could be better so what you do is
you still do keto it's just the same
diet plan you were
except you take a little bit of fats out
of your day
make us yourself a nice calorie buffer
same calories as before just lower fats
you reintroduce those calories as carbs
pre-training
and post-training all of a sudden you
have way more energy way more pumps way
more recovery
way more muscularity over the long term
and you've moved from ketos
works which is right there in the middle
it works fine to lose fat
and you know maybe retain muscle and you
move just a little closer to optimal
and eventually if this isn't good for
you anymore you can move closer and
closer and closer until you're in pure
evidence-based diet doing your best
possible job give that some thought
and if you hate it downvote the fuck out
of this video
but comment for the algorithm see you
guys next time
