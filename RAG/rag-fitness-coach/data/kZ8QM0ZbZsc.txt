egg yolks are full of nutrients that you
actually don't find in egg whites they
have inside them a huge quantity of
ultra high quality protein actually half
of the protein in the egg is in the yolk
the only downside is that they have lots
of fats these fats are not specifically
very bad for your health they're not
trans fats they're actually some of them
are quite good for your health so egg
yolks Jerry speaking are quite neutral
for your health as far as fat profile is
concerned and the only way that egg
yolks really affect your diet and your
health Etc is they just have way more
calories than they egg white so if you
have the calories to spare
in your meal and you want to eat real
eggs with the yolks go to town no
problem at all
