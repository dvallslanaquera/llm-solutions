regardless of how hard you work at this
and how long you work at it for
and how great the results are that you
achieve the unfortunate reality is that
you're probably
never going to be genuinely satisfied
with your physique
what's up guys sean alijani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i'm going to be
revealing seven red pill truths
when it comes to gaining muscle losing
fat and just building an impressive
physique in general so
things that aren't very often talked
about because even though they're true
they
maybe aren't the most uplifting things
to hear and they're things that a lot of
people just aren't aware of
especially beginners but ultimately the
truth is the truth you guys know that
we're not here to
[ __ ] on this channel i'm not gonna
feed you a bunch of
feel good false positivity just for the
sake of it and i think that most people
will be better off in the long run
if they understand the reality behind
these seven things and let me know in
the comments which ones
resonate the most with you or if there's
anything else that you would personally
add to this list
all right the first red pill truth on
the list has to do with genetics and
that's that
genetics don't merely play a role in the
muscle building process
they actually play a pretty critical
pretty
important role probably more of a role
than most fitness coaches would
ultimately want to admit
now that said anybody out there who has
at least somewhere around
average genetics give or take okay with
the proper program in place and enough
hard work and consistency over the long
term
they can still achieve what would be
considered to be an impressive physique
so don't let this discourage you
but where genetics do play a pretty
significant role
is in terms of just how quickly any
given person can put on muscle
how seriously they're going to need to
take their training and nutrition in
order to build that muscle
what their ultimate muscle building
potential is going to be not just
as a whole but also on an individual
body part level
and also what their physique is going to
specifically look like in terms of
overall aesthetics the reality is that
unless you have
upper tier genetics unless you're uh in
the top few percent
you are not going to look like the vast
majority of popular fitness influencers
who are showing up in your instagram
feed
and that's because by necessity for
someone to reach that really popular
position and gain that amount of
attention out of the
millions of other people who are posting
fitness content they're gonna need to
have the type of genetics that allows
them to build a truly elite physique and
stand out from the crowd
and when it comes to looking really
impressive when you're shirtless and
when you're posing in
pictures and videos muscle shape muscle
insertions and how that ties in with
your height
your limb length your waist size your
joint size all of this stuff is really
important and it's pretty much entirely
the result
of hardwired genetics from birth looking
impressive on social media isn't even
really about raw muscle size
it's more so about being really lean and
then having
good structural genetics to go along
with it since it's really hard to judge
size just by looking at photos so if you
are
pretty lean and you also have that
optimal body structure for bodybuilding
you have those
you know that really good muscle
structure those shape those insertions
that's really what a lot of this comes
down to
so i know this is a massive cliche but
ultimately you just have to make the
best of what you
have again most people out there can
still build a solid
muscular lean strong body but just like
you're not going to become
let's say an elite sprinter or an elite
basketball player an elite
mathematician or musician unless you
have a certain amount of
god-given talent for those things you're
also not going to have an elite physique
unless you also have the genetic
capacity for that and some people might
see that as discouraging
but i think you could also say that it's
very liberating as well
because understanding that can free you
from the disappointment and the
dissatisfaction
that comes from having unrealistic
expectations red pill truth number two
speaking of elite physiques on social
media
you also have to remember that a lot of
the people you see probably more than
you realize
females included k on top of having
elite genetics
uh pharmaceutical enhancement is also a
very very common thing whether someone
is doing
full-blown cycles or something like trt
or sarms
which still provides a very significant
muscle building advantage
a lot of these guys even if they were
natural their physiques would still be
unobtainable
by most people out there with average
genetics but then when you add peds on
top of it it just gets taken to a whole
new level
not to mention that you start adding you
know pumps and optimal lighting and
angles and flexing and filters
and possibly even straight up
photoshopping on top of it
that takes it again to an even further
level most people
if they are uploading a physique picture
to a large audience on social media
i'm not saying that everybody is you
know severely manipulating their photos
but
most people they're going to add at
least you know a little bit of sharpness
they're going to improve the lighting a
bit
if i look closely in a lot of these
pictures i can see where people have
darkened the lines around their abs
things like that now there are still
plenty of legit
natural lifters out there with
impressive physiques who don't overly
manipulate their photos
but there's also a whole lot of fake
natty
adobe gain specialists mixed in there as
well so if you want to use social media
for
educational purposes and follow people
who are actually putting out
useful content that directly assists
your training in nutrition follow me on
instagram or you just find physique
pictures and videos to be motivational
or entertaining
or you just enjoy watching and listening
to certain personalities even if you
understand that it's not a real world uh
portrayal of how things are in reality
um and that's fine but do keep in mind
that in a very high percentage of cases
it's exactly that okay it's not a
realistic portrayal of the real world
because very often you're looking at
somebody with top year genetics on peds
and who is only posting their very best
most optimized photos and videos
and sometimes those photos and videos
are also very heavily edited as well
red pill truth number three if you are a
natural lifter
which is the route that i recommend that
the vast majority of people go
at the very least until you've been
training um solidly for a good five to
ten years naturally
and even after that point most people
should still stay natural um unless they
truly require something like
maybe trt for legit medical purposes
but if you are a natural lifter unless
you've got those top
1 in 100 genetics you are not going to
be very big
and very lean at the same time okay
you're not going to have the best of
both worlds
you've probably seen these kinds of
memes floating around at some point and
there is a lot of truth to this
if you're a natural lifter and you want
to be really big like the type of
physique where you look
significantly jacked even in clothes
you're going to need to sit at a
slightly higher body fat percentage in
order to do that probably in the higher
teens
probably something like uh maybe 16 to
20 body fat
if you want to look really big you're
going to need to be okay with looking a
bit
softer you'll look awesome with a shirt
on but you're going to look less
impressive without a shirt on and less
impressive in uh photos and videos if
maybe you make a living from fitness and
that is something that's important to
you um it'll actually cause you to look
smaller
in photos and videos and then on the
flip side if you want to be really lean
you know rip six-packs striations veins
popping out everywhere
not only are you likely going to end up
with a variety of
diet related side effects okay less
energy more hunger low libido
irritable mood things like that on top
of that you're also gonna have to
sacrifice a pretty decent amount of
overall muscle fullness and size in
order to get there so you're gonna look
really impressive
in a tank top and when you're shirtless
and when you're posting things online
um it's great for racking up those
instagram likes but in real life in
regular clothes
you'll pretty much be flirting with do
you even lift status
but bottom line guys you're not going to
be really big and really lean
unless you're on a consistent dose of
that high quality
pharmaceutical grade creatine and
personally my approach is to go
somewhere in the middle
so not too big and too soft not too lean
and too small
i usually don't go below about 12 body
fat and i rarely go above
about 14 and i think that strikes a good
middle ground balance between
size and leanness as well as overall
physical and mental functioning
both in and out of the gym red pill
truth number four
involves the sharp diminishing returns
that are at play
when it comes to gaining muscle as a
natural lifter so muscle growth is not a
linear
process where for each set period of
time you just gain
x amount of muscle and you just keep
getting linearly bigger and stronger
over time
every pound of muscle that you gain will
come at a slower rate and will be more
difficult to achieve in comparison to
the pound of muscle that came
before it and that's because your body
has genetic limits in place
to prevent you from carrying too much
muscle since muscle is metabolically
expensive tissue
that requires uh more energy to maintain
as you gain more and more of it so in
the first year of proper training you're
going to make your newbie gains
where muscle growth happens relatively
quickly since it's a brand new stimulus
for your body
and you'll probably put on something
like 50 of the total muscle mass that
you're ever going to build
assuming that you do things properly uh
and consistently
and then from there it should slow down
by about half from year to year
as a rough estimate so year two you
might be at 75 percent of your total
gains
year three maybe 85 percent and then at
years four and five and beyond
you should be right up near your natural
limit if you've done things correctly
and that doesn't mean that you can't
still make gains but it's going to
happen
way way more slowly and it's really
important that point to be patient with
things
since you'll basically be lifting for an
entire year just to gain a very small
amount
of additional muscle if you're expecting
to make gains at the same rate in year
three
or year four or five in comparison to
year one
and you're just shoveling back a ton of
calories and being too aggressive in the
gym trying to force new muscle growth
you're either gonna end up fat or
injured
or fat and injured which is probably not
what you are aiming for
red pill truth number five switching
gears a little bit and that's on the
topic of supplements
okay most supplements not some not a
decent percentage
but most supplements do not work period
and i say that as somebody who owns a
supplement line and where it would
actually be in my best interest to just
hype the ever living crap out of
supplements to get more people to buy
them
there are a select few supplements that
can be helpful for
maximizing overall training performance
uh body composition overall health
i use them personally and i've
recommended them for many years uh we
currently have a pre-workout
multivitamin and fish oil which are
three things that i've stood behind for
many years and we have a protein powder
and a creatine on the way as well
but the bottom line is that the
supplements that actually do
work are very few and far between and
they're just the icing on the cake
after your training in your diet is
fully dialed in okay they're not the
cake itself
like a lot of people out there think 90
to 95
of the supplements being sold right now
are complete [ __ ] and they're not
actually going to do anything for you as
far as building muscle and losing more
fat is concerned
bcaas testosterone boosters growth
hormone boosters
uh fat burners glutamine advanced forms
of creatine
high tech protein powders uh intra
workout supplements
cla the list just goes on and on and
then even
within the categories of supplements
that are worthwhile um like
you know a multivitamin pre-workout
creatine blend most companies don't even
formulate those ones properly either and
the real truth
is that a lot of these fitness
influencers and youtubers um i know it's
not what people want to hear
but many of these people really don't
have your best interests at heart
even though they might seem like they do
on the surface you know they've got that
big smile on their faces
what's going on everyone vince here they
seem sincere or whatever
but the reality of this world is that
people do in fact
lie in order to make more money as
shocking as that might seem and even for
the fitness coaches out there
who do have good intentions many of them
just aren't very knowledgeable about
supplements in the first place and so
they just go ahead
and they promote all this crap without
even realizing that they're ripping
their audience off
so don't take anybody's advice at face
value be very skeptical do your own
independent research
because if you don't chances are that
you're going to end up wasting a lot of
money on a bunch of garbage that is
ultimately providing you with little to
no benefit and is really just a fairy
tale
okay the right supplements in the right
forms and the right dosages
that can help to round out your overall
fitness program but
most of what's out there is really just
a straight up
steaming pile of worthless stinky
horseshit
red pill truth number six switching
gears again and these last two are a bit
more on the sort of mindset side of
things
and number six is that regardless of how
hard you work at this and how long you
work at it for
and how great the results are that you
achieve the unfortunate reality is that
you're probably
never going to be genuinely satisfied
with your physique
as a beginner you might be thinking you
know if i could just put on some muscle
you know lean down a bit look even half
as good as these guys
are that i see on instagram that would
be good enough and i'd be so happy with
that
but that is really not how things
actually work in the real world i
guarantee that is not what will happen
what actually happens is that as your
physique improves the bar for what you
consider to be a good physique is just
going to move along with it and this
applies to every area of life
not just fitness because it's just how
our brains are
evolutionarily wired to keep us striving
for more and more
with each new level that we reach you
know each achievement that gets unlocked
whether it's fitness related or career
related or maybe an athletic endeavor or
really anything else that you're trying
to improve at and that you're taking
seriously even if it's
you know a video game that you're
playing once you achieve a new level
you'll get a temporary little burst of
warm fuzzy
good feelings but pretty soon after that
uh that new level that you've achieved
is just gonna become your new normal
it won't satisfy you anymore you'll
mentally return to baseline
and you'll just look ahead to the next
level you'll start comparing yourself
uh to the people who are at that next
higher level you'll aim for that maybe
you'll achieve it and the cycle just
goes on
and on and so i think it's more about
just accepting that and learning how to
sort of live in harmony with that
rather than thinking that one day you'll
have arrived and you'll be fully
satisfied and fully content with
everything since
uh sorry to break it to you but it's
just never going to happen which is why
um like a lot of people say it's more
about learning to enjoy the process
rather than getting overly hung up on
the concrete external results
and then lastly red pill truth number
seven the ultimate red pill
uh related to the previous one as well
but looking at things in an even
bigger picture standpoint which is that
building a lean and muscular body
is not going to make you happy now to be
clear
it can definitely improve your quality
of life you know consistent training
proper nutrition those are obviously
great habits to have that will
physically make you feel good by just
optimizing your overall brain chemistry
in general
and also when you feel good about how
you look you know you feel confident in
your appearance you like the way your
clothes fit you feel like
a reasonably attractive person yes that
will bring a certain level of
satisfaction into your life that you
didn't have
previously and i do encourage you to do
it you know anybody who pretends that
they don't care about how they look or
that
they wouldn't rather be healthy and
active and in shape is
straight up lying however it's not going
to do
what a lot of people think it's going to
do for them it's not some
magic bullet where you're going to build
this lean strong aesthetic physique and
all the women are going to come flocking
to you and all the men will bow down and
respect every time you walk into the
room
and you'll just be in this state of
constant bliss over your amazing new
chiseled features again it just doesn't
work like that in the real world
just like making a bunch of money won't
do that for you buying material
possessions won't do that for you
getting a bunch of girls will not do
that for you none of these external
things
are going to put you in some kind of
permanent happy state
if there's anything in life that is
going to bring you more
lasting sort of genuine satisfaction or
a higher degree of internal contentment
it's going to be the less sexy things
like you know meaningful relationships
having a purpose of some kind
contributing to others being in nature
doing activities you enjoy
and then the one that overlaps with
fitness which is physical exercise
good nutrition proper sleep things like
that those are probably the things
that will contribute more to your
psychological well-being
as opposed to having 3d delts or
nine percent body fat so again
absolutely go ahead
and build the body that you want look
the way that you want to look there's
nothing
wrong with that i myself work really
hard at it and i enjoy it and i get a
feeling of satisfaction from being in
good shape just even on a basic
uh surface ego level but don't think
that it's going to fix you on some kind
of fundamental level
it's not going to make you happy in the
deepest sense if those other more key
areas of your life
community purpose health if those things
aren't in order you know if those things
aren't in order then you'll still be
unhappy

physique might be so thanks for watching
