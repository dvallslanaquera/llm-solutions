oh it's good to be back weekly webinar
dr james dr mike
here to answer questions dr mike how you
doing doing great james i'm
ready to bite into these questions ah
all right so i have a special
announcement so i'm gonna screen share
centrally came we still don't have fiber
optic but they essentially installed
what is effectively two dsl lines
so i am screaming over here look at my
screen share
see that 21
[Applause]
is that even legal how i'm like a
bandwidth philanthropist over here i
might start donating some of mine when
you go from like 0.7 to 21 it's
life-changing i tell you what you're
coming in super clear right now awesome
i'm glad so hopefully that translates to
slightly higher quality webinars from
here on out so hopefully
you guys are all happy all right
first question is from
abdul abdul rahman
all right oops i got a screen share
again huh let's get rid of this one
okay got it all right
so abdul rahman asks hi docs for
intermediates prioritizing hypertrophy
at 15 to 20 percent
body fat is it more optimal to state
maintenance or a slight deficit
until the desired physique is reached
or should they mini cut and then balk
and repeat and if you answer
if your answer is to stay around
maintenance is that a viable long-term
strategy or it's just a few months
thanks for the awesome content you guys
are the best so uh thank you so much
um i'll tell you this man um there's
tons of viable strategies
but there are uh better and worse
strategies so to echo
one of the things that meadow
henselman's uh and he's a guy to follow
for sure
has been very clear about this uh menno
is absolutely
one of the biggest proponents of the
fact and he's gathered a ton of research
on this and
done a ton of uh analysis at a sort of
deep like you know
histological level almost of you know
what in different tissues way and how
fast they've crew and
hormonal stuff meno is one of the
biggest proponents of the fact that you
can actually make gains at maintenance
you really can't gain muscle in this fat
and hilariously and amazingly and of
course expectedly
meno in all his brilliance says yes but
also
if you cut and bulk it's faster than
doing that so
he's not like these guys has to say it's
not possible he says it's a very
possible and a very is a thing
it's not something you want to do uh
it's just you're taking away your
biggest possible weapons
uh which is the deficit and the surplus
so our recommendation to you probably
you'll see what james says
if you're a beginner you can do
maintenance and everything's great um
as an intermediate prioritizing
hypertrophy there's nothing wrong with
being between 50 and 20 body fat so
but if if you know so if you wanted to
be a little leaner
do a real cut like a 10 8 8 or 20 fat
loss phase
get rid of some fat get in that 12 range
and then do the second part of where you
answered
is mini cotton ball can repeat okay
that's totally fine
uh if you are fine being between 15 and
20 there's nothing wrong with that you
can just
mini cut bulk and repeat just there
that's totally cool
i absolutely would try to dissuade you
from staying at maintenance for a long
time and trying to build muscle or a
slight deficit
because a slight deficit is probably men
i would say it just drags out your diet
for forever
you get some optimal gains for a long
time get rid of that fat
or keep the fat doesn't matter and get
to massing quicker so you can get rid of
it quick and then go
or stay there and then start massing
adding body weight is the best way to
gain muscle james
yeah so i largely agree with dr mike
here i think you know beginners
can get away with doing the more
maintenance style dieting and
just making huge beginner gains across
the board i think this is one of the
pivotal points for intermediates where
it's just like not not a good use of
your time and it becomes increasingly
necessary to actually have structured
cutting and massing phases
so i think in terms of the short term
the obvious answer would be yeah maybe
you can just maybe go right into the
masking or do a mini cut and then go
into mass but i think in the long term
what would behoove you the most
is to do like a regular cut get yourself
nice and lean
so that you can start having nice long
stretches of masses
where you don't end in like a super fat
spot and you have a ton of time to work
with so
i would say from a long-term perspective
i would push you to
getting as lean as you reasonably want
to get for whatever
cut macro cycle you want to run and then
start to
set yourself up to have a really long
productive mass macro cycle which might
be like
three mesos mass a mini cut another
three mesos of mass
something like that and then you might
end somewhere around where you are now
but now you've got a lot
in terms of body fat and now you got a
lot more beef hell yeah
great stuff fake natty is up next just
below abdul rahman
all right number one uh
is it quite it is a quite common belief
in some bodybuilding circles that grainy
looking muscles can only be achieved by
a very heavy training anecdotally
strength athletes that are lean
i.e cloak off dan green mars bajanowski
do have the density look
uh the same is often true for
bodybuilders known for heavy lifting
with a strength background stand
efforting during each ronnie coleman
is there any marriage to this theory or
is it mostly genetic and just
coincidentally a lot of guys
position for this look to lift heavy is
there some truth to that could it be
related to sarcoplasmic versus myofibril
hypertrophy on that note what is the
current scientific consensus and whether
or not do we agree to what degree one
can be obsessed over the other
training style so i'll just ask these
reverse signs there's no scientific
consensus just quite yet
um but it seems to be that over the long
term uh
muscle growth occurs in a pretty even
manner sometimes you can get lurches
forward of sarcoplasmic lurches forward
of myofibrillar but in the end i think
it
is very similar unless you're
consistently trained with very different
repetition ranges
and then the stella is very similar
after that um
it's almost not going to ever you know
the external look of a muscle is very
unlikely to be altered
by the training intensity although
there's potential for some small
alteration i will say that
we got to think of counter examples
because first of all there's tons of
bodybuilders trained heavy all the time
that don't look dense
um and uh dexter jackson never trains
heavy and he looks
like grainier than everyone so you can
at least think of one person that just
doesn't
put in the mold um i will say that i
think
one of the confounding factors is the
guys that really like to train heavy
on really tough hardcore guys they also
run the kind of irresponsible levels of
gear that make you look grainy
uh you look back to that list you you
list it and that applies to every single
person on the list as far as i know
so that's another confounding factor so
is it possible that
heavy training makes you look grainier
yes is it likely i find that it is not
likely
we have to stay open-minded but i don't
think it's likely james
yeah i agree i think the graininess is
largely just genetic factors it's just
how some people look and some people
don't it's also a leanness thing like
the leaner you
get and can stay like the more grainy
you will look doesn't mean that you'll
have that super
you know like john meadows grain train
but train heavy uh
he's grainy as he's the greatest
guy in the world yeah so i think it's
largely just like people just look
differently you know like i have a giant
head
you know this is how it goes it's the
luck of the draw uh
so i don't think there's any influence
of training though so like you know
sometimes you'll see you can see some
minor influences like mike was saying
like
if you do a metabolite as well you might
have like a really big perma
pump going on
and you might look a little bit
different in that regard but it's uh
more of a temporary thing uh number two
the trend in the west is to make laws
related to recreational drugs less
strict especially when it comes to
marijuana
why in your opinion don't we see a
similar phenomenon when it comes to
performance enhancing drugs steroids
peptides etc
rose are worse than lobbying than
stoners i don't believe there's
no lobby there's definitely a little bit
of a stone in the lobby so the fraction
of people using
marijuana is maybe two orders of
magnitude higher
uh than uh the fraction of people using
uh anabolics
there's a thing where you know anabolics
are used to cheat at sports in some
capacities and most people find that
gutturally displeasing
in a way they can't describe it is like
uh morally
uh you know just an anthem really to
many people
and most people can't uh disambiguate
things that make them uncomfortable
versus things that should be legal
which is why we live in a less free
society than we should
you know i don't like onions but i'd be
completely insane making them illegal
you know is a perfect example so um i
will say though that
you know eventually i think most uh more
drugs and more drugs will become
legalized uh
as probably the number one reason is
that as they have become more legal in
various other countries and
jurisdictions just
nothing negative has happened at all uh
in portugal you can use pretty much any
drug uh
face no criminal penalties they just
don't have a drug problem
uh and you know in the united kingdom
uh his use of all anabolics is
completely legal
uh and there's not a steroid epidemic
and kids aren't dying of drugs in school
so over time i think it's gonna relax
and i think marijuana legalization is
gonna lead the way
maybe in five or ten years when the
entire united states says legal weed
and absolutely nothing bad happens it's
gonna bring some other drug loss to the
forefront
mushrooms are probably gonna become
legal they are legal i think in colorado
already
and a bunch of other places because
people made them illegal out of just
1950s momentum conservative
just ah drugs man and uh never really
questioned it
it turns out the drug war is probably
the worst thing ever so anyway
james what do you think yeah there's a
lot of um
humble pie that has to be eaten in order
for the drug war to go away so you know
how how quickly that will happen
i am personally of the opinion that we
will probably be approaching
let me back up so i think that the
steroids thing is because it's so taboo
as mike already kind of alluded to so
it's like
irreparably taboo in the united states
so
i think that we'll probably get to like
the homo deus cybernetics
stage before we overcome the taboo of
steroids
and i think that will be true for a lot
of issues i think like
that's going to come really quickly and
people will be less concerned about
things like
steroids race you know like all sorts of
crazy issues that are really important
to us right now but then once people are
 half
half human half cybernetic people just
be like yeah that was dumb why did we
care about that so much
i can i have a computer in my my
body yeah when you can computer alter
your
way of thinking or you can genetically
engineer yourself to be way many
different things things like race all of
a sudden it's like gives a where
you started
like here's this upgrade to make you
amazing and everything right now like
now i can junk
yes finally finally
screw you dunk guy on rp yeah
just pure cheating i don't know if you
followed his post at all um
but people were giving him some grief i
don't know how hard but uh
because he was he was like touching the
ball in the basket and people were like
that doesn't count you have to like yes
and he asked me my opinion i was like i
am of the opinion that you have to like
downward pressure the ball
for it to be a dunk but at the same time
it's like dude you're right there you
know you're right there i will say that
james are going to have to agree with
you and this is not
i i don't mean this to be mean this is
absolutely just
my true thoughts i think what he did was
incredible
a dunk is when you have a basketball in
your hand
and you run up to the to the rim and you
 put it in
with one hand at least in yourself
people can't throw it you can't tip it
in that's not a dumb
um that's my my thoughts on that yeah a
lot of yeah totally and uh but anyways
it was awesome and i think like i was
saying i think like a lot of this stuff
people's minds and opinions won't change
on these topics anytime
soon and i think technology will change
very soon so this is going to be one of
those things where people like okay
we'll go look you know 50 years from now
we'll go look back and be like people
used to be
upset about steroids that's so stupid
next up bastian ingerly
what the oh
he's got three questions boston what
we're going to do is answer your
first two you're supposed to be asking
one it's your first two
and then ask another one next time okay
folks let's keep it to one question at a
time
that way we can feature more people and
do more justice to the
people that do ask so number one does
using connective tissue to generate
force increase the wear and tear of
corresponding joints yes
for example when doing the bounce at the
bottom of the squat is this more
injurious on the knees compared to doing
it controlled
absolutely uh that's not up to me
if you and that's just like an
acceleration deceleration thing that's
true for impact injuries it's true for
all sorts of things in the body
yeah number two if so can you train the
connective tissue so that it adapts
maybe slowly increasing the number of
sets you do with balance yeah absolutely
and you will adapt and you will get to
way lower injury rates eventually
with a bounce squat that you would have
initially but you'll never have lower
injury rates and a bounce squat than you
will
in a squat that is completely possible
so
yes can you adapt to anything yeah but
does the magnitude adaptation
absolutely get you to a lower injury
risk than you would with safer methods
no so for example
here's actually a pretty perfect example
what is your risk of dying in a car
crash if you're
running your car at 130 miles an hour on
normal roads and
normal freeways and going around people
high okay can you adapt to that yes you
can uh get technical race car driving
education for one year training and race
car driving
and your risk absolutely will go down
now
how high is your risk still is way
higher than going 30 miles an hour
you know or going 65 like you're
supposed to
so can you reduce the risk yes is it can
you reduce it to as much as it's the
same for
paused squats no yeah at that point you
just asked the question is it's not all
right or wrong it's just
is is the risk worth the reward of
whatever it is that you're doing and so
in sports
people do techniques like this all the
time so that they can have a better
performance
um in you know training and bodybuilding
and stuff you can make a case that
getting a good bounce out of the squat
might allow you to use a little bit more
weight but
it's the payout it's you know what you
want it to be in terms of gaining muscle
and then you say well what's the risk to
reward ratio there
and i think mike and i would lean to
probably not good
in that case um
his number three is interesting um
boston why don't you ask number three in
the next webinar the second one coming
up after
and we'll be able to uh get to it then
uh it's a good question and then at the
end james for you he says please james
do more movement anatomy videos they
are the best i wish i wish i could do
like the leonardo dicaprio like
snarky meme um yeah i'll try and do some
more of those now that i have uh
now that i actually have some decent
internet i can start cranking out videos
much more effectively now
the problem before was that it would
just take an eternity
to even upload them um so
mike canis got it
mike cass
questions asked um
all right so mike canis asks
in a rather rude way i'm just kidding
transitioning from
a cut to bulk on the rpi portrait
templates where should i start in the
template for bulking
if i stopped in the cut say week 3 of
meso 2 for general hypertrophy
should i start to bulk in the middle of
the mess right after and
do and still do maintenance after or
should i just hop into a completely new
macro cycle
starting as one of general hypertrophy i
would say happen to completely new macro
cycle is really good
um the thing is is that we can't get
perfect alignment
between the training templates and the
diet templates because your training and
diet
uh don't you there's a variable length
of time
for your diet really variable and the
training length of time isn't nearly as
variable because it's rather constrained
um so i would say just start at meso1 of
general hypertrophy nice clean slate
after a nice deload
and good to go and he actually says do i
deload at maintenance at the onset of
the transition
um it always says do i still maintain
after well that's
if you're gonna be doing that so don't
maintain as soon as you're done cutting
i would
start bulking in meso1 of general
hypertrophy
and do i de-loaded the maintenance at
the onset of the transition
so during your deload week after the cut
that is at maintenance right as all
d-load weeks are
and you absolutely deload of course and
then you get ready and go in
and do some serious stuff then he says
how strictly do you recommend not
cutting
during the metabolite meso i'm told to
eat at maintenance during that one thing
you can cut the metabolite nozzle it's
just not for everyone because it could
be really really fatiguing
um but it's totally fine it's just one
of those situations where if we gave
that as general advice a lot of people
would burn out
so uh you know buyer beware be careful
uh you can cut through it just i would
recommend it not be your first rodeo
james yeah i agree and so it looks like
he says he stopped
the cut uh week three of meso two so
he's not
you know probably cut for a full mezzo
and then a little bonus after that
so i would say you're probably good to
go with the d load a lot of the times
we'll recommend that you take maybe like
a two-week
active rest in between as as that
transition period but
i think you could kind of go either way
on this one you weren't so deep into the
cut that you need a lot of time
re-synthesize i would say you're
probably fine
definitely do the deload and then you're
good
all right right below him some dude
norris
got it third week of the mezzo
performance increasing on the first set
but rep drop-off is becoming more severe
i.e performance is dropping in
subsequent sense
right now i plan to overreach then
d-load is this the best approach or
should i keep motion
so what you want to do some dude norris
is take
and compare your this week to last week
all comparable sets so for example let's
say last week you did three sets of
bench
this week you did four sets of bench
there's three sets in week two
four sets in week three so the fourth
set
can't be compared to anything there's no
set to compare two so you just compare
the first three sets of bench
first three sets of bench in week two
first three sets of bench in week three
and you compare the average number of
repetitions per set
that is your performance okay so you do
whatever
let's say it's 11 10 nine reps in
week one and you know twelve ten eight
reps
or sorry in week two and then twelve ten
eight week three the average of both of
those is ten so your performance is the
same
and if you went up in load your
performance is technically increasing so
you don't have to deload
because we could say to you look the
first that's all that matters but that's
not true because you could go super hard
on your first set and your preparedness
is actually technically down
you just use some emotionality you were
saving in the tank and then you said rep
drop-off is becoming more severe in the
subsequent sets but our question of how
severe can only be answered by averages
so compare average performance over all
comparable sets in
week whatever to week whatever after and
if there is a decline in performance
then absolutely you overreach uh you are
overreaching out then deload
okay but if it's still going up then
proceed uh as normal james
yeah i think and i'm i can't say that
this is
for sure the issue but for some dude
norris a lot of the times this happens
because
your rirs are way off week to week so
what so here's the situation basically
you did an
rir of like five
thinking you were doing three and then
the next week you do an rir of like
one thinking it's two and that first
there's just a much greater uh
differential in those sets so you
basically
you look week to week or across multiple
weeks and you're like it seems like my
performance is going down
it's really because you were
undershooting your rir and
when you find is that when you really
that whatever you were going for like
rer three or two for example
they'll tend to be clustered in more
similar ways and you won't see that big
despair
uh from week two weeks so my guess is
that you probably
were maybe lowballing it a little bit
maybe the first week or two and then
maybe
you might have been right on point or
maybe a little little above and in
whatever week that your third week
that you're noticing this yeah
that gets better over time as you get
better at estimating all those things
yeah yeah at the end of the day some of
that is why we say
you know it's so funny uh jared and i
just did that debate with uh eric helms
and brian miner
and some people like to really sort of
rush to conclusions that aren't evidence
not eric and brian in this case but just
some of the commentators on youtube it's
funny
they they someone pinned this to saying
like if your performance decreases then
you deload right away and they're like
that's kind of crazy because they also
say the performance is variable
like yeah because we don't say deload
right away your performance has to be
confirmed in decline
which means at least two sessions have
to be down
contiguously one after another from a
normal performance last week for us to
say okay it's
probably cumulative fatigue so it's just
funny that some people
you know uh forget that but the reality
of the matter is that
you have weird days you have your ups
and downs if you're consistently
underperforming
at least two sessions in a row for the
same muscle group
you can begin to say okay this is
something that's real
and like it's some of it's very obvious
like just for this has been part of my
life lately so it just comes to mind
like i've been chainsawing a lot like
i've chainsawing with my neighbor
yesterday we were helping one of our
guys in our neighborhood who
was just uh too old to do it himself
anymore so we were doing it
and it my biceps up really bad to
be holding that heavy ass chainsaw and
cutting those logs
does that mean that like when i did my
back workout today and it didn't go
quite as well as i'd hoped it would go
does that mean i need to de-load no it
just means that my arms were up
and doing all that chainsawing right
just like okay i had a bad
session because i had some other
going on but tomorrow
when i do my push workout i'm sure it's
going to go totally fine because those
muscles weren't affected so i mean it
seems like obvious but
that's kind of the logic that they're
using it's very very cut and dry so you
have to be able to
have a little bit of nuance and
piecemeal those things together
all right notes
right below there
green says i overreached at the end of
every muscle cycle five to six
week long mezzo and at the start of week
three to four my sleep quality starts to
suffer
as a 16 year old that requires good
quality sleep to fully develop height
for example should i be concerned
um i don't know about concerned but i
think you're definitely pushing it a
little too
hard you can do things to increase your
sleep quality try to get a little bit
more sleepy a little regular sleep do
all the sleep hygiene stuff
maybe it's your diet you could be eating
maybe a bit more and that would update
that
um maybe you're systemically just
loading uh way too much
as far as uh trying to grow in a bunch
of different muscles where you could
just be
limiting the number of muscles you
overreach at the same time the systemic
load isn't this great
but yeah i think that uh your idea of
overreaching is probably a real tough
 and just like grinds and
can push
maybe back off of that a little bit and
week five and six
maybe week six should be the only one
that disturbs your sleep and that's fine
uh you just make you real tough uh over
the long term it's not gonna hurt you
but week three and four yeah it's a
little early and i think that you're
making such great gains
that you can mask fatigue for that long
but i would push it a little less hard
uh or just progress a little smoothly
james
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna be a little
harsher than dr mike was like you young
 youngsters over here doing this
stupid um yeah so really the
reality here is um sleep disturbances
are a normal
uh occurrence when you start to
overreach so it's not that's not a big
deal that's normal
however that shouldn't be happening in a
five to six
week mezzo that early on that should be
more of a peak week you know last week
before d
load kind of issue maybe even into your
d load a little bit so to me
looking at that that means you're way
over you're you're going wait your
progression is way too hard you probably
need to go back
to some of the things that you're doing
go back to the drawing board and see if
you could um
progress a little bit less aggressively
so that you're hitting the same num the
same general like
sets per week that you are now in
weeks five or six when you plan on
overreaching so to me that just seems
that's way over
way too aggressive of a progression so
maybe start a little easier
and don't go quite as hard week to week
and see how that goes
so it's okay to have sleep disturbances
i'm not you know we're not trying to say
that there's
it's you're doing anything wrong
necessarily in that regard
but you want that to happen much later
in your mesocycle
if it's going to happen because then
somebody's gonna say well dr james and
mike said you should train until you're
having sleep disturbances no that's not
what i'm saying i'm just saying it
happens
but if it's all this time happening
halfway through your program you're
going too hard probably
or can address other things about your
recovery
[Music]
all right uh just below there is two
below is
jacob kowalski got it
is there a good rationale to ever
program some maximal singles and doubles
and a strength block instead of a
peaking block
if yes then how would you go about it
high stats higher frequency
one percent of 1rm i'm not talking about
doing a single at 8
rpe with something like um
six sets of two or ten sets of one so
the one reason i could see doing that is
working on your setup
you really only need to work on that
during the peaking block but some people
are stuck so bad at set up they might
start in the strength block which
whatever i mean by setup walking out
following commands
noting where your feet are noting how
you're generating a core bracing
and blocking before you unwrap the bar
practicing the breathing practicing
looking forward at the judge
so on and so on and so on right that can
be done for sure
that can be done in your warm-ups like
your last potentiation set before every
work set
or before every you know cluster works
out for an exercise you can just take as
a mock meet
and then do a double or whatever or a
single um
as far as anything else nothing really
comes to mind
uh here's the fundamental thing
that when you're in a strength block or
strength as a cycle your
goal is to get under a certain load and
execute a certain amount
of volume under that relatively heavy
load okay
if you get under heavy load but you
don't exert the requisite volume
the total magnitude of the stimulus
isn't good enough it's kind of like
you have a really tasty milkshake and
you take one spoonful of your yum and
someone's like that's it milkshake
you're done you're like
part of the milkshake is that there's
more spoonfuls say they guess no i don't
want a thousand spoonfuls of really
shitty tasting milkshake that would be
like training for sets of 100
you know but i do want you know five six
really awesome spoonfuls of this really
great milkshake and anything
in between is really stupid and
no i wouldn't pay 500
for an amazing one spoonful of the
world's best milkshake as that
that's like an rpe 10 single like it's
not just gonna
the strength stimulus just isn't there
right so
the real thing is and here's how i like
to put it once you walk out with a 75 or
85
or something 1rm you are capable of
doing
it too close to failure three to six
reps
why would you at any point rack it and
wait longer make your training vastly
more inefficient
like once you have and remember
unracking and racking is fatiguing
not just time consuming but once you
have the weight in your hands
just crush the rack it rest
a good time and then go
that way you get three to six units of
stimulus
instead of one unit of stimulus that's
it and honestly guys like
this sounds stupid and maybe
there's some stupidity to it maybe some
really clever people are doing this for
good reasons
i'm going to speak for james real quick
and i'm sorry if james if i caricature
your view wrong we've just known each
other forever i think i'm going to guess
this one right
james and i honestly think the
90
of the people that are trying to do
singles just want to do singles
because it's manly and hardcore
that's you just want to do
singles bro and there's nothing wrong
with other guys i always want to do
singles but can we
as sports scientists tell you it's a
good idea we can't give you that we
can't cut you down
yeah and the funny thing about some of
the and just using the examples you gave
uh you know doing like ten by one or six
by two at like sub maximal singles
it's like what is ten by one getting you
that two by five
at roughly the same weight it's gonna be
pretty close to the same weight at that
point
right it's like two sets of five you get
a three by three or whatever
yeah exactly any of those i mean sup max
singles is gonna be in that three to
five
rep range yes why not just do it
and as mike said like racking unranking
is such a pain in the ass
literally in this case um i don't see
any benefit
to doing that i think you know
like it's not uncommon for some strength
blocks to dip into
those one to three rep ranges before
like you might do that before you
actually go into peaking
oh sure yeah yeah yeah and that might be
okay
to do that but not for the sole purposes
of saying like
i'm doing some crazy singles protocol
because i think i'm going to get
something out of it no
you're you're you're doing one to three
reps as part of your strength block and
that's just where the reps fell
you know that's it not just like oh i'm
doing singles today it's just a waste of
time
except for peaking
all right though quite a ways down there
is
darren hawkins darren
hawkins there boy
[Laughter]
got him all right um
is the muscle strength gained from sets
of five to ten reps
different anyway from the 20 to 30 rep
range oh my god almost the same question
right or sarcoplasmic so less permanent
so it's a good question
we're going to start off with saying we
don't know for sure
but our best guess is that it's largely
the same kind of muscle it may be
temporarily more sarcoplasmic
or myofibrillar depending on heavy
versus light but in the long run you can
convert one to the other no problem
so it's probably no less permanent and
no less structurally different in the
long term
however in the short term the pination
angle
and the way that muscle fibers point and
specifically the neural adaptations are
very different in sets of five to ten
versus twenty to thirty
so for a short time if the function
you say less functional the functional
outcome is to be able to do high
endurance
or capacity work muscle gain in the 20
to 30 rep range will be way
better at that because it will have more
endurance capabilities
on the other hand if functionally you
want to convert to max strength
or sets of three to six basic strength
sets of five to ten are
absolutely the way to put on that muscle
because the conversion will be immediate
or very close to immediate this is why
james and i are really not big fans and
we've sat as much in our scientific
principles as a strength trading book
not big fans of sets of 20 to 30 for
strength sport
because technically you can get jacked
like that and eventually those muscles
can be used for maximum strength
the problem is and i kid you not and
james i'd like to hear your opinion
on this the transition to making those
muscles strong in the relevant rep
ranges if you start the 20 30 takes
months plural oh yeah and the transition
from sets of five to ten
just that's a three to six takes weeks
and maybe like two weeks
so it's a huge difference if someone
told me
hey i can bench press 225 for a set of
30
at the end of this block am i ready to
be a power lifter i'll be like yeah in
like
six months but if someone's like hey i
can bench 315 for a set of 10
pretty much roughly the same strength
theirs or muscle size
i'd say yeah you're good to go sued
you'll be doing 365 for sets of three in
no time
uh it's a huge difference in that
short-term window james
yeah i totally agree with that and i
also think like there's uh of course
strength to body weight considerations
right so if you're putting on if you're
in a weight class sport like power
lifting weight lifting comes to mind
even bodybuilding but less so in this
case uh you want to be putting on
muscle that's going to be contributing
to whatever's that you're doing so like
mike said if you're putting on a lot of
kind of more slow twitch muscle which is
fine
if you if you're responsive to it is it
going to help you in your performance
yes or no
but how much is that going to alter your
body weight and your ability to
interact with the world so for example
you could have something like a soccer
player
right and if you're trying to gain
muscle doing sets of 20 to 30 yeah
they'll gain some muscle
and it'll make them slightly more
endurance but most of the action in
soccer is in those high power situations
so now you have somebody who's putting
on a lot of muscle that's not
contributing to high power output and
that's going to throw off their power to
body weight ratio and that'll manifest
in their ability to sprint
change direction jump kick all sorts of
other stuff so
there's different ways you can kind of
look at it most people think like well
gaining muscle is just inherently good
right
well if it's muscle that's actually
making better at what you want to do
then yes and if not then you have some
other problems that you have to balance
absolutely absolutely i noticed uh
when i used to do sets of mostly five to
ten and power lifting type stuff
my transition to athleticism was way
easier than doing bodybuilding work
yeah it's definitely a thing even like i
i know you probably feel the same way
even if you come off of like a
metabolite heavy meso
and you move into like a
re-sensitization period or even like an
active rest period you put like a little
bit of heavy weight on the bar and
you're like what the i feel
weak as and then it comes back in
the coming weeks but that first week
you're just like why i'm so
sick 100 is terrible
all right
mike four no sorry just mike because i
copied his name with the four days
mike mike did he get this name how did
he nail this name on youtube he must be
the first person to use youtube
he says in greg dussett's new 199
dollar training book in his free video
top 10 scientific training tips to
maximize muscle
200 bucks there's no way that's
true hold up i'm going to google this
 real quick there's no
my man 200 bucks no hey hit it right we
need to raise our book prices
milk that out um
let's see the book believe that it's 199
[Music]
there's a video click on this video
it's from may 2019 here you want a
screen share so we can all see
yeah yeah um
okay so there's that
yeah you caught him at a funny funny
spot rise subs
merchandise so those are just t-shirts i
guess
well hold on let's click on a store i
don't believe
that he has a book that's 200 um
all products i like how we're going on
an adventure to discredit mike from
youtube
okay training hard last time mugs
shirts be a circle put down
zero or something i don't know zero
it's a weird he does i think it's a
joke i i don't i don't know about a book
or anything but anyway um
all right let's go back to the world
let's just go to the content of the
question itself so
the book book price aside um
greg nassett's new training book and his
free video top 10 scientific training
tips to max nice muscle
and guys if you if he does really have a
200 book uh let us know on youtube show
us send us a link
i'll post a link on this on this video
he talks about how important time under
tension is for hypertrophy
he states 40 seconds of eccentric
contractions is the golden period
a set should have and if it's shorter
than that then it's going to build less
muscle and more strength
do you agree is this sort of training
better for enhanced guys
as i thought this stuff didn't matter
for naturals first of all there's almost
nothing different about training
enhanced naturals it's just a couple
tiny little things so it's all a myth
uh pretty much or for the most part so
no um
uh 40 seconds of eccentric contractions
uh
would mean that your concentric takes
maybe
that's uh 20 seconds to another 40
seconds
that's each set takes a minute to a
minute 20 seconds that's on the long
side
uh sets can take as little as 30 seconds
and maximize hypertrophy
if the load is sufficiently uh high
if they're taking close to failure sets
of anything less than 30 seconds this
probably just doesn't convert to
enough mechanical work being done um if
40 seconds of
eccentrics is just it's a bit there's
been on the high end 40 seconds seems
like a lot because you think about most
eccentrics are around like two seconds
for most people
right so you think seconds is 10 reps 10
reps yeah exactly so
he's saying basically like 20 reps is
is the best you know for hypertrophy and
anything less is left now you know you
could go as little as
a third of that comfortably uh go to 15
seconds or even less
of eccentric 10 seconds if you centric
you'll be getting great
and also just keep it keep in mind too
this has
it's this is just one of those silly
click baity type things because
as we've talked about at length in this
webinar and many other cases there's no
like
golden number of reps that
universally applies across the board
right there's different rep ranges and
loading zones and some people respond
slightly better in some than others and
and to some degree everybody should use
all of them in some capacity
that seems to be what we found so far so
to say that like
okay you need to use the same number uh
same seconds of time under tension which
would roughly equate to
some number of reps and that's the best
it doesn't make sense because it falls
apart on a number of different
individualization levels
right like what if you have somebody
who's just fast twitch as
and all they need to do is like sets of
six to get the most out of it to get the
most growth like
how does that apply do they're supposed
to do like
10 second eccentrics on all those six
arrests yeah
no that that's not very well thought
through
as a charitable way to explain that yeah
so just keep keep an eye out for things
like that because if there's no
one-size-fits-all we can only say like
here's all the things you can do here's
some pros and cons of doing them and
kind of trial and error and figure out
which seems to be working for you
because there's no way for us to know or
for you to know
unless you go and try
all right all the way down really far
about four questions up from the bottom
is montas
oh he's back
let me know what the are you mantis
oh this
is our last question asked her for today
where the is oh there he is got it
months asks how to differentiate if
overreaching is occurring from doing too
many sets or pushing too close to
failure that's a
 great question as mantas is
prone to
asking so let me try to begin to answer
it
fundamentally there is a bit of
uncertainty because when you overreach
you can only know that it's too much of
something okay
uh actually i have a perfect analogy as
usual because i'm dieting my balls off
right now and i'm starving
uh did you get too you got really full
over full from a meal was it the steak
that put you over the mashed potatoes
well
like it's both right because he had a
big old hunk of steak and a big old
thing of mashed potatoes
but if you simply remove the steak you
wouldn't be full and if you remove the
mashed potatoes you wouldn't be full so
that's like a magical element
that one really contributes to the other
thing
but hold on then
you do have to try to figure something
out though because you're going to
manipulate one or the other of these
variables to try to get closer optimal
so what you want to do is compare your
program to two things
two other values one typical programs
you've done in the past
and you're going to compare them on
volume relative to the others like this
program they do now is a
higher volume or lower volume or similar
volume to programs i've done in the past
and two failure proximity on average
like am i pushing close to failure this
time or really farther much further away
or is it really
you know about the same and then you're
also going to compare your
this past program two programs done by
everyone else
and we have a really good summary of
sort of all the programs that kind of
work
volumize our airwise et cetera on the
rpe uh
you know run spiritization website
hypertrophy guide central hub
where if you look at the volume you're
doing let's say you're doing uh
eight sets of chest per week and you're
overreaching on chest
because it's just not likely that's the
volume that's getting you
you know you're probably training real
hard and and
also mind you this is this assumes your
message cycle is the same length as
always because if it's a different like
another cycle there's a third variable
you've just been training for long and
your fatigues are given
but assuming your mess cycle is the same
length then you just sort of look and
say okay
my bench volume is i'm typically doing
for chest
uh 10 to 14 sets uh as a maximum
recoverable volume
and most people are doing 10 to 20 sets
as a maximum recoverable volume
i'm overreaching from eight sets man you
know and i i know i've been pushing
pretty close to failure
but i wasn't sure there's your answer
like it's it's not
we can't say it's from failure for sure
because there could be other things but
it's definitely not the volume
if you know what i mean right that's
like saying you know you have a meal and
you're like well it was the steak or the
mashed potatoes the dimin
and like all he did was like have one
scoop of mashed potatoes but two steaks
like it's probably not the mashed
potatoes now like
you're not gonna fix that meal to be
less filling by like increasing the
amount of steak and decreasing mashed
potatoes
that's not the problem right um and same
on the other end where if you are doing
let's say
you're honestly doing like sets you
thought you were doing three or four rer
most the time
but you're doing like 40 sets of chests
and you're like man am i pushing too
close to failure is that why my chest is
starting like doing
straight 40 sets
it's not the failure it's the 40 cents
so
that's how i go about attacking that
problem and there's going to be some
mystery
but it's not too hard to figure out uh
just real talk yourself like i've
i do this all the time where i'm like
why am i so up like oh yeah like
one and a half time my quad volume from
usual that makes sense i'm like you know
what i have been pushing really close to
failure
and it's a pretty honest assessment
james yeah that was really good i have
kind of like the dummies
guide for that and this is just meant to
be kind of like your first filter your
first
funnel so if you're finding that you're
overreaching
is primarily just local to the muscles
that you're being trained
signs kind of point to but maybe don't
directly indicate volume
if the overreaching is more systemic and
you're always systemically overreaching
and you're like why do i just feel like
that is probably because you're doing
way too high rir very very consistently
because
doing like one zero rirs just takes it
out of your entire body and takes a lot
of psychological arousal
takes a lot of output from the nervous
system so that's just kind of like a
filter so if you're if it's you're
finding that you are systemically
overreaching a lot i would lean towards
it being an rir issue and if you're
finding that it's more of a muscular
issue like my arms are always just
gassed out all the time but i feel okay
otherwise it's probably more of a volume
issue
that's actually really good james and i
would say that especially applies to
big muscle groups like back and
quads and that's one of those things man
it's so funny because there's this
movement
always there's a movement to do
closer to failure training and just go
to failure at hardcore that's how you
make gains
and it's always interesting to me that
whenever i have for years i used to
train everything to failure multiple
sets
whenever i go real close to failure i'm
almost always missing this crazy growth
folks talk about but i
always get this unreal amount of
systemic fatigue
that like if you go truly to failure
especially with higher repetitions
it's so badly you up systemically
that you're like
this head better pay off and when it
doesn't you're like
god damn it yeah it sucks and what am i
doing
for me personally i i almost never go to
zero rar anymore just because
it ruins it ruins you and for me i
usually even on my peak weeks i usually
keep it around one just because i don't
want
to pay the toll and i don't mind if you
think that's me pussing out or checking
out whatever i've already paid that toll
plenty of times i know how it feels
i know what an effect it has on my body
so for me i usually just keep it at like
rer1
and that's like my where i end my peak
weeks now granted i'm not an aspiring
athlete
so do as i say not as i do kind of thing
ah that's it we're done that was good we
had a lot of kind of the
the um questions relating to essentially
does
training affect the type of muscle or
the look of muscle so those were all
kind of weird and interesting
i like those ones and it's hard to
answer so it keeps us on our toes
folks i hope my quality was a little
better this time i'm rocking that
20 mbs yeah i'm making it rain
weird hand with strippers or just
feeding i thought it was great james on
my end it was great so
i think glasses here awesome welcome
welcome change okay any um any cool
videos or any upcoming news
looking at youtube first of all thank
you guys so much for watching our
 stupid youtube videos um
cool news on youtube we just passed 110k
subscribers which is
trippy because we just had 100k like
three weeks ago
going so fast um there's a ton of videos
doing super well right now
people love the 15 squat mistakes on how
to fix them with charlie
uh and people love the exercise number
considerations and stuff
it always pleases me when people the
highest viewed videos are the ones that
are like 25 to 40 minutes long and
highly technical i'm like wow people
actually want to learn that's great
usually you got to go for the click
baity stuff right like this guy's a
totally well the athlete x video isn't
57k
views right now but that's just like a
great joke of a video
but also like it like got to hit 7k or
it got to like the 50k mark and then
like sort of petered out which is a good
thing like thank god people are
clicking on those too much uh but we're
you know
guys we are recording videos breakneck
speed
we are designing videos at an even
faster speed
and we're listing down video ideas
at an even faster speed continue to
expect
roughly three high quality scientific
blah blah videos
technique stuff theory stuff for a long
time
every week at least three videos
that's awesome so guys if you want to
see all those videos you know where to
go you gotta click that subscribe button
and then you'll get an alert every time
when new one comes out which there are
plenty so
thanks for engaging with us we like
having your questions and we like being
able to shoot the a little bit with
you so
hope to see you again soon for now we're
out peace
