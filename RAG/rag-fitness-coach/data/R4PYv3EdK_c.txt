hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
let's tackle a big question why do so
many bodybuilders particularly pretty
good ones
train to failure what are we going to
talk about today well first of all
what is failure got to define that first
who trains to failure
why they trained a failure what are the
benefits of training to failure
to the extent that there are any what
are the downsides of failure training to
the extent there are downsides
and what's maybe a better way to train
than just going to failure or just
avoiding failure
let's figure it out so first of all what
is failure in the best
sense of a charitable understanding
failure is when you cannot do
any more reps concentrically of the
movement like in a bicep curl when your
biceps just stop and you come back down
and your technique is still ideal
you're not like stopping like you should
have stopped here but you started
jostling your hips a bit and then you
who knows if it's failure or not
this is called technical failures when
your technique breaks down you cannot do
another
rep with good technique and it's not
psycho whole body failure we're talking
about so
we talk about failure for the rest of
this video we're talking about technical
failure
the best kind of failure that's the
safest and makes the most sense so on
and so forth
now who trains to failure well
tons of jacked guys trained to failure
tons of jack girls too uh even a lot of
pro bodybuilders train a failure or at
least
claim that they trained a failure but we
find out that when people say train to
failure they can mean a variety of
different things
some claim to train every step to
failure every working sets failure and
some actually do that
some claim to just or actually just
train the last set of every exercise or
even session
to failure all the other ones are not
exactly the failure
some claim to train to failure but in
reality they just stop a set when it
gets hard it's not really you've ever
come very convincing failure
and some actually do train to failure in
any one of those respects they really
are pushing it all the way
some train beyond failure they do four
straps to eccentric failure for example
so after you can't curl the bar anymore
your training partner helps you curl it
up and you control the way down you help
you curl it up and when you can no
longer control the way down
then you're done right and here's the
thing
if so many jacked people train to
failure
or at least flirt with the idea it's at
least worth a consideration for us
sciencey folks
uh to maybe think is there something
behind that that's a good idea that we
can look into
maybe now here is
sort of trying to answer the questions
of why people actually train a failure
central question of this presentation
probably four reasons as far as i can
tell why a lot of folks train to failure
number one is it works
okay failure training guarantees that
each set is very stimulative
if you're trained to failure you're for
sure training as far as set to set the
set goes
very hard hard enough you're good to go
so if you're way outside of failure
you'll be doing everything else right
but still sucking because you're just
not training very hard
but if you're trained in a failure you
know you're off to a pretty good start
number two failure training fits
psychologically in a couple of ways
super high testosterone males who
predominate the lifting culture and who
everyone looks up to
they love to go all out right that's
just a part of
what being male and being juiced up is
all about
not only means juiced up steroids wise
just just having lots of natural high
tests
you just want to do stuff like run into
brick walls and all the stupidest shit
in the world and all the most impressive
shit in the world has been done by
males with lots of testosterone it's
just something that happens so when you
get a testosterone
fueled male and you're like do this
exercise and do your best
they're just going to go to failure okay
another thing
is psychologically stopping short of
failure kind of seems like quitting on
yourself
right so if someone says like okay two
reps in reserve is good enough it
doesn't really feel good enough it
doesn't feel good unless you've done it
all
and to that end there's something
cathartic something therapeutic about
really giving it your all and going
through crazy amount of pain
and not your brain's stopping you but
your body being like i can't take this
anymore that's kind of like a
like a man versus uh you know man versus
nature
kind of victory there and it feels good
right
in that sort of milieu there's a
cultural reinforcement there and it's
point number three
tons of the biggest guys seem to go to
failure to some extent
so most others follow along because they
want to be like the big guys if you see
the big guy doing anything you're like
well that's probably why he's big
never mind the fact that how many years
they spent training what their genetics
are and
if they're using drugs is really their
three biggest but all the details do
matter to some extent and it is worth
looking at bigger guys
what are they doing when almost all of
them train a failure at least that
occasion it's going to leave
the rest of us thinking oh man maybe
that's what i should do and because it
fits psychologically so well and because
it works pretty well
that's kind of a no-brainer why a ton of
people train to failure
at the very top of bodybuilding and all
the way through the ranks
well lastly oh sorry and then another
thing on cultural reinforcement
because it's tough and
uh because it's a challenge any reason
that you give yourself for other people
especially for not
training to failure makes you suspected
for being a wuss
you know you say well on a technical
level or failure training might not
increase hypertrophy as much people just
shut up you're just trying to run away
from hard work i totally appreciate that
view
because some of those people really are
trying to run away from hard work so if
you're trained to failure there's no
questions about your manliness there's a
question about your commitment
it's got all these other benefits you
know you're off to a real good start
and lastly it's fucking simple okay
there's no need to estimate effort
there's any
planning three rer two or the hell is
even the difference between those two
you just give it your all let the chips
fall where they may
it's great right it has really really
good benefits right
and that's a lot of the reason why
people train a failure
because it works psychologically it fits
especially the demographic that mostly
does it
there's a big cultural reinforcement of
you know if you're really serious you're
gonna train a failure
and it's super simple so a lot of people
just do that right
now some of those things are definite
benefits so let's talk about the
distinct benefits of failure training it
does have distinct benefits number one
it guarantees that each set doesn't
leave gains on the table
okay you're definitely gonna exert
yourself to a maximum extent
even if you're feeling down you know
reaching failures everything you're not
going to give up
so for example if you're saying oh i
need three reps in reserve today but
you're feeling like kind of like crap
that might really be six reps in reserve
but if you need to go to failure even if
you feel like crap maybe that's three
reps in reserve in reality but that's
already really close to failure and gets
you all the benefits so it's a really
really great
sort of bottom mark for working really
hard
number two it standardizes the stimulus
and fatigue magnitude you know
when each set is to failure three sets
equals three sets of stimulus and three
sets of fatigue so you can scale them
and if you take away a set or if you add
a set you know how much stimulus and
fatigue you're altering so for example
if last week you did 10 sets and they
were all
failure and you got a certain amount of
stimulus and fatigue and you want to
know you wanted to do a little bit more
you just add a certain number of sets to
failure you know you're getting a
proportion
the increase in the fatigue if you did
three reps in reserve last week and then
this week's two reps of reserve how many
sets do you add but when each set is
going to be harder it gets really
complicated right so the standardization
really really good benefit next another
great benefit allows really easy
progress tracking
okay if you did 10 reps of 200 pounds
last month to failure and this month you
did 12 reps
you definitely made progress you don't
have to discount for rir you're like
well
200 pounds i did 10 reps for three rer
this month i did 12 but that's 2rir like
did i really lose a rep or gain a rep
what happened
if you go all out you know exactly where
your watermark is
plain and simple it's just kind of like
in other sports
you know how good a team or individual
really is when they're matched to
someone they have to use all their
abilities like you see someone's a
really good wrestler
put them up against the state champ
you're gonna find out exactly how good
of a wrestler they are
uh especially if they lose but like by
how much you think someone's really a
stun
they go up against the state champ they
lose ten to eight right that is really
good man that's top three in the state
right but if you think they're a stun
they go up against the champ they get
pinned in 30 seconds
ah you know that push to failure it
really exposed some weaknesses right
where if you think someone's a stud but
they're
wrestling for rar wrestlers all the time
they could be just demolishing people
but if the people you're wrestling sucks
you never can quite tell so similar
analogy
number four in very advanced folks
hypothetically
training to failure may eek out some
small gains that
short of failure training just can't do
by providing a really superlative
stimulus like the real exclamation mark
maybe certainly worth of consideration
right especially worth of consideration
because a lot of the failure training
proponents are very very elite
bodybuilders that may no longer be
growing
well from anything but their absolute
best effort something to think about
now downsides of failure training
there are a few number one the research
just hasn't been kind to it
the hypothesis that training a failure
is better than not training a failure is
not a new hypothesis it's been around
for a while
it's been tested a lot now they've
basically found that in beginners
three reps in reserve training is
essentially equivalent in hypertrophy
to going to failure uh oh boy
okay so but people say now hold on a
second
beginners don't know how to train to
real failure and they think they're
refuting that point
they're actually doing it making that
point stronger so what you're saying is
this
beginners think they're going through
our ir they're really six rer
but we have the data to show that people
that you now claim and let's say we
accept your claim
beginners really are training at 6rir
and when they think they're failing
they're training 3rir
so 6 and 3 reps in reserve and beginners
is the same hypertrophy game
holy crap then what the hell hope is
there for six and three hours
worlds apart six hours barely trading 3r
is now challenging
if six and three r and beginners gets
you the same gains
that what the hell does do you really
think zero rir
is going to show some kind of big
difference of course not right
almost certain not same idea is if you
look at studies only in intermediates
truly 3 rir and 1 rir doesn't seem to
make a difference in intermediates
so it looks like failure just really
isn't needed for anyone but
maybe the advanced okay usually people
say they could train into failures
better than training not to failure
and then the beginner studies came out
and they're like but not in beginners
just intermediate advanced
and then the intermediate studies came
out they're like maybe just in advance
right it's not overly compelling anymore
right and who knows they might do some
research on advance to show it's not
even necessarily in advance which is why
i say maybe we just don't know
bigger problem number two the stimulus
fatigue ratio of failure training is not
ideal
okay failure training stimulates as much
maybe less even a little bit more growth
than near failure training that's not
all the way to failure
okay but it contributes way way more
fatigue
way more fatigue mostly from
psychological uh effects like
rpe like when you go to failure it's way
harder for you perceptively than
not going to failure and it taxes your
system all together
huge huge difference right so two sets
at two reps in reserve two whole sets
might cause the same fatigue as just
one set of true failures for our
systemic fatigue is concerned
but two sets a 2 r probably grow like
1.3 to 1.5 times the amount of muscle or
stimulate the amount of muscle growth
as just one set of training to failure
how the hell is that worth it right so
you got the same fatigue from two sets
as one set but at the same time you have
way more muscle growth it just seems
better to train shy of failure instead
of failure
there are exceptions to that but this is
definitely something that's going to
leave you thinking for a while
and not just be like okay failure
training all the time
lastly in beginners it leads to
technique breakdown when beginners go to
failure their technique breaks down very
often or that leads to
injury risk stuff and your poor stimulus
to fatigue ratio no longer hitting the
muscle you want so really really bad
news
and it's almost certainly not worth in
beginners okay a lot of times people say
beginners don't know how to go to
failure
that's true and they say they have to
learn no they don't
they can just go really shy of failure
get amazing gains and ingrain their
technique a ton
when they become intermediates they can
learn how to go to failure because
that's maybe when it's necessary we
don't even know if it ever even is
right in advance lifters going all the
way to failure
we're not sure but it might create some
instability that may increase
acute injury risk maybe another may be
but definitely not a good maybe
something worth considering right if an
advanced lifter
is told hey here's a challenging weight
for you that you've only ever hit for 12
reps
hit it for us for nine reps what is your
assessment that you'll get hurt on this
set let's say the incline barbell press
then say you know like nine reps out of
the twelve i think i should be fine
if you tell the same advanced lifter you
know lifters have their their wisdom
they say okay i want you to do as many
reps as possible you have
you have great spotters but i want you
to go all out and get 12 reps or more
now what is your probability of injury
they're going to be like uh
it's low it's very low but yeah it's not
zero and it's not something i'm maybe
super comfortable with doing all the
time
makes sense right when you have lifting
competitions even for reps and strong
men
people tend to get hurt more often in
competitions than they get hurt anywhere
else and a lot of times that's maybe
because they're pushing to failure even
for reps
now taking all this into considerate
consideration it looks like we have a
little conundrum here because
failure has a lot of things going for it
but it also has some pretty interesting
attractions
i think there's a better way the third
way that's a reference to uh
actually the fascist politics and uh
1930s germany
how about that for for off color
reference so here's the deal
maybe a better way to train is this
failure training has its merits
especially in setting a really high bar
for stimulus to know we're
really really doing a good job and
letting us track progress super easily
granted okay we believe it but it has
downsides too
you don't need to train to failure to
get really really good gains unless
you're maybe very advanced
and it carries tons of fatigue better
spent elsewhere so what can we do that's
better
we can start our meso at anywhere
between two and four reps in reserve for
beginners more like four
three ish for intermediates two for
advanced because it gets tougher as you
go
as you start your meso you do all your
sets and reps
and and weights and you write all that
down
and then the next week you try to add a
few pounds
or rep or two each week
and then the next week you try and add a
little bit more for example you squatted
200 pounds for sets of 10. next week to
2.5 next week 205 next week 207 5 still
sets a 10 10 10 10 10 all the way
through
or you're doing push-ups you did a set
of 18 and then a set of 16 in the first
week next
time you do 19 and 17 then 20 and 18 and
so on and so on
so you keep increasing the load and or
reps
every single time set increases happen
for other volume reasons we've covered
another video so we just leave that
alone and
we're talking about it within each set
you increase an increase in increasing
increase just by little increments
because you started at let's say 3rir
one of two things happened as you
increase your reps and load either you
would get infinitely strong forever
that would be sweet that's actually the
preferred option i could call this the
plan to get infinitely strong forever
and it would be huge false advertisement
or
eventually as you keep adding by small
increments you get closer and closer to
failure and eventually you hit failure
and once you've hit failure you're
probably really close to your mrv
you won't be able to increase the
stimulus anymore because you'll start to
get temporarily weaker
you deload drop the fatigue
start at three or four rr again but with
a little bit more weight the last
mesocycle a few more wraps on and so
forth
and you start that push again this way
we get the awesome benefits of
reps and reserve training but we only
have to estimate rir
once at the beginning and it's okay if
what you thought was three was really
four we thought was three was really two
no big deal because those little tiny
increments of increase every single week
are going to take care of everything and
just naturally direct you to eventually
making training harder and going all the
way to failure so this way
we get all the benefits of training shy
of failure
and we get the progressive overload of
going closer to failure
and we get the benefits every now and
again at the
tail end of our accumulation phases of
actually going to failure
maybe even beyond for advanced lifters
and providing that huge
stamp that exclamation mark that
superlative stimulus
we're covering all the bases and we're
essentially instead of having to choose
from two buffets
the dessert buffet of failure and the
regular tasty chinese buffet of
rir training we're just taking a plate
we're taking out of our training what we
need
and out of dessert what we need i should
have been wrong you don't want to mix
dessert
and chinese food on the same plate
unless you're fucking animal like me
you just mix it all together eat it
folks that's all i have for today
gives us some thought train to failure
or don't see if i care
you
