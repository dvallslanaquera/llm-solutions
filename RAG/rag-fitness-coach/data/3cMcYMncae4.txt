slow
good oh my god
my legs
that was it that's how we're doing one
what's up guys i'm here with my old
training partner good friend and new
ifbb pro
ashley lockamowski and russian mike
yeah uh today we are going to be filming
ashley training her we have mostly quads
yes or is it mostly hamstrings um today
is
hamstrings first thing quads yes so
mostly hamstrings and then some quads at
the end uh
it's her week three of her message cycle
she actually kind of learned some
programming for me whenever we were
training partners in san antonio so she
actually wrote her own message cycle
and we're just going to be kind of
motivating her because she's post show
it's time to put in some work for the
offseason me and rush and mike are going
to be yelling at her and making sure she
goes through lots of pain
and it's going to be a good time in the
russia pain is normal way of life like
i'm asking
you ready i'm ready
let's look russian mike here pinata
first exercise lying hamstring curl for
a back of leg hamstring
it really bring out the back of leg
anyway multiple sets
set of 10 to 20 reps you get good
stimulus to fatigue ratio
full range of motion everything under
control one thing you notice
female ifb pro usually trained better
than male
because they're not giant egotistical
animal paniatna
one more after this right back up
beautiful good okay so
she has written down what she did last
week and you've seen how we're
progressing through our massing phase
so i believe she did uh three or four
sets on this last week we're gonna try
to use similar weight the machine's
probably a little different
but the load and the tension on the
fibers is gonna be the same no matter
what so we're gonna try to beat
what she did last week by at least a rep
maybe at a set depending on how she
feels and how her recovery was last week
so i'm gonna ask her some questions
about that and we'll see what she's
gonna add and what she's gonna
just do the same basically how was your
soreness
you were able to train legs fine the
next session cool so we'll probably add
a set and beat the first three sets by
like a rep or something yeah
beautiful light taps
two
[Music]
three good
[Music]
nice light test
[Applause]
yes halfway let's go
let's take this one about two from fail
i'm gonna trust you on this one you
trained me long enough i know when
you're bullshitting me
[Music]
you'll notice between sets i'm asking
her how does the pump feel
before we started i asked her how her
soreness was last week and how her
recovery was last week
so those are three metrics that you can
use to
track progress and see where you need to
add volume so she had a good pump from
this exercise so far
we're gonna see how it feels at the end
if she does four sets it gave her a
really good pump she gets some good
soreness
and a recovery to the next session is
decent probably keep the sets the same
for the next week and just add
uh reps if she gets very little pump uh
minimal soreness and recovery from the
next session is like she was ready days
ago
then you can add sets eleven come on
one more let's beat last week
[Music]
beautiful good stuff
good stuff another good morning
smith machine good morning downside
smith machine make you worth not
real weight not barbell and russia
everything barbell
positive good mind muscle connection you
lock in range of motion and path and you
can really focus on pushing hips back
real critical element here you don't
want your back around
you want to stay nice and tight you want
your glutes to push back
and you want to make sure your knees
stay right here here
bad here bad right here and you move
your butt back
feel big tension in hands stomach out
chest up a little bit feel great painful
tension is the goal
set of all five to ten rep usually good
why five to ten one
compound heavy movement very good high
force
two for many people once your lower back
do more than about ten rep
you get tired in the limiting factor not
your hamstring
panatna
knees back nice and easy good stay tight
one more one more ashley big chess come
on
chest up yes slow
off good shot good shit
that was really good
all right folks uh turning off russian
mike for a second serious commentary
so here's the deal uh big question is on
the smith machine good morning where do
you put your feet
right because potentially we could put
our feet really far forward
we could put our feet right under the
bar we could put our feet behind the bar
and there's of course a spectrum of
where we're going to put our feet this
isn't really a question
at all biomechanically on a regular good
morning because your feet are just put
wherever the bar auto selects after that
with this because the bar is locked in
where you put your feet is actually
potentially important
so there's some nuance here if you put
your feet really far in front of the
machine
then what ends up happening is you can
feel a better hip hinge
but your range of motion is more limited
so for some folks that aren't very
flexible
but like a lot of tension in the
hamstrings that's potentially a good
move
if you step really really far back and
you're kind of tilted forward
you get a huge range of motion and
hamstrings but
because your back is stretched out a
little further and your center of
gravity is a little bit in front of you
the ability to generate high tension can
be somewhat compromised
so somewhere between extremely far in
front
and far really far behind you have to
pick your own
best position and that doesn't mean it's
going to be necessarily right under the
bar
experiment if you've never done this
exercise before
do a few warm ups try a little bit in
front full range of motion
try a little bit behind try in the
middle see which one works best for you
for me personally
just slightly behind the bar gets me a
really baller range of motion
tons of tension in the hamstring doesn't
compromise my force generating abilities
enough to be worth the trade-off in the
other direction so i like a little bit
behind
you might not be of that proclivity give
it a shot it's all about finding
a situation in which you can produce
high tension high force
get a really good block and brace going
but still get a huge
translation in your hamstrings and get a
ton of tension build up
right there give it a shot the pain is
part of the process
and up you got two more big chest
arch hold the arch slow
big chest use the hamstrings one last
one
big chest pause for a second
up good job that's it good stuff very
good
we got it that time
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay guys russian mic back i don't know
what happened stupid american mike did
the last intro
okay here's the deal leg press not all
same sometimes leg press designed by
stupid idiot then bad
all bad mechanics off however we can fix
here's the deal
most lag press they don't let you have
super deep range of motion without your
butt coming up rounding
bad for back what we want we we get a
rigid
and there's foam roller only good use of
foam roller
and then whatever the fuck that is some
kind of pad we put it in
that waker keeps up already it gives her
full range of motion at the knee
no flex in its spine beautiful full run
sfr what back jed what do you think i've
never heard a russian used the term
ghetto rig
now you can first time for everything
jared
so this is her uh hamstring emphasis day
so her quads are on the backbone of this
day
she did two sets last week probably
gonna go three you said your pump was
pretty decent
and you recovered before the next
session so we're gonna go three sets
we're gonna try to match those first two
sets with a little more weight
see how it goes
good more there's a reason you're an ifb
pro
12 keep going let's go go rest
13 take your time at the bottom we're
not rushing these
again control
beautiful two come on one more
one more get it together get it together
hit it you're going to be strong on this
track let's go let's go
push push use your legs yep rest
you got two more right one and one
actually one and one
one pause again and then we'll go again
chest push push good
last one go good chest big chest
gentle big push
good stuff good stuff
oh shit that was a long ass out of 20.
sorry guys
no it was great that was all perfect
you're doing it just like we say in
russia
one long-ass set let's just cash this
one out let's just cash around
two sets sixteen come on
[Applause]
gentle let's go seventeen
rest beautiful three two
hit it
yes good again
[Music]
push push go go go go go go go go go go
rest
breathe one more last one
[Applause]
breathe in before you push it breathe in
push that's it yes
other
thank you
so you guys have seen this one on the
youtube before
it's gonna be a little squat or a lunge
sumo
super sets uh ashley is a figure
competitor so
big legs big glutes big back that's
their goal this is the uh
glute final exercise for glutes and
hamstrings and quads
gonna be fun how many sets fun well i'm
gonna do one set here
yeah just one she's pretty cooked yeah
she's pretty cooked yeah i'm maxed out
at this point
yeah plus the exercise variations
changing from last week to the bulgarian
split squat last week
lunge is slightly different especially
with the superset lots of metabolites
not gonna be very used to it
so just putting in two or three sets of
this right away would toast it for the
next week
good no breaks between steps go go
yep there you go
good way to control big chest
two more for lake two more per light
let's go
four total one
[Music]
two yes again come on
three last one immediately into sumo go
go go go go
right there toes out more sit back
up oh yeah
[Music]
you have the strength to do it let's go
up good hips open
right here open up right back down when
you get up down
down up control the eastenders
down slow go go go go right now
up good no bullshit take your hands off
your legs
down control control up up
three more ash one down let's go let's
get this
one of three right now slow and up fast
one down slow up fast
two last one go big chest slow
good oh my god
my legs
that was it that's how we're doing one
okay guys listen russian mic here again
kef training easy if you do it wrong
tough if you do it correctly number one
any calf machine work great
two rules one go nice and deep
slow big stretch rule two come
all the way up the contraction hold for
a split second
no bending knees like crazy no heating
weight
wait for calf raise through calf raise
humbling
okay not a lot of weight kept not huge
muscle
but you do high rep set of 10 to 20
maybe even up to 30 rep
high quality slow eccentric big deep
stretch
full lockout oh my god ouch
anyway let's get started
excellent deep stretch
excellent deep stretch come all the way
up
[Music]
two more finish up strong
good and one last one
big stretch
that's it slow good stuff stretch that's
it
good stuff one is good okay
guys that's call workout ifbb pro
ashley lakomowski great stuff
movements close to failure full range of
motion
tons of stimulus very little fatigue
although as you can see some fatigue
cost always comes
like we say in russia fatigue is what
life is about
all you do is accumulate fatigue and
then you die hopeless alone
jared yeah great great that was a great
job good job
how do you feel um hopeless and alone
very much
so blessed and tired and now you get to
beat that next week
yes oh my god
[Music]
you
