oh it's good to be back dr james dr mike
what's going on
not much i'm excited to dig into these
questions
oh dig in well your boy
speaking of dig it's not really a dick
more of a smash but i got a log splitter
which is just a hydraulic press with the
wedge on it that's used to crush
logs to death 2017
anymore i do a little bit of it but man
all you do is you put it up it has like
a little cradle
and you just i mean it takes it's a
little bit of mechanical stuff you got
it to fill up with gas
oil hydraulic oil but once you kind of
get it set up right you just turn the
labor and it just
crushes stuff for you it's amazing so
i've been having some fun
with that it gets me pumped have you
tried to put your hand in there yet
no no definitely don't want to do that
it'll crush anything pretty much so yeah
definitely live in that montana life but
i'm ready to answer some questions too
let's get to it
all right henrik anderson is up first
all right henrik is a perennially
popular
uh question asker voter
i blame the name yeah he says
all right so tom quote unquote here
has a systemic mrv of let's say 125
total sets
would it be more beneficial for him if
he wants to grow muscles to trade
everything
low slash mediocre volumes or prioritize
some muscle this mezzo and de-prioritize
them in the next one
how would your answer change if tom is a
beginner novice intermediate advanced
thanks for the knowledge docs thanks to
you on becoming inhumanly small
and i'm pursuing a career within sports
science taking biology and
maths in school and the dream is to
absolutely humiliate doctor mike in a
debate
uh that's i would love to see that i'm
excited for when someone fucks me in the
ass
other than greg just said of course um
you guys are making a 16 year old's
dreams come true big thanks from norway
by the way
heinrich is pronounced hen as then henry
and rick as in rick henrik
henrik motherfucker your name is
heinrich cause
it's germany that's germany and shit
right yeah
um so real quick i just got a shameless
plug here this question is explicitly
answered in two books
and the technical answer is and how much
should i train and then the practical
answer is in the new hypertrophy book
exactly but we'll sum it up for you here
real quick
so if you can fit all of your
mev to mrv transgressions
into the 125 total sets
then you don't need to prioritize but as
soon as you're not able
to get all of your muscle groups that
you want to get bigger from mev to mrv
uh when systemic fatigue set number is
lower than the total sets you would have
to do to do that so
if you had to mrv for all your muscle
save time was 150 sets at some point
then we we are sort of estimating james
and i and a couple of our colleagues
are thinking it's probably something
good to getting close to mrv
regularly and that training even if it's
productive but
only from nav to halfway up to mrv
and never going to mrv on a muscle group
for a variety of reasons probably not
optimal then we might be wrong
but we think that's probably the case as
soon as you have a muscle
or muscles in which you can't go all the
way to their local mrvs
we don't assume that you're getting your
best growth so then our answer would be
as soon as you can't go
to all muscle mrvs at the same time you
need to start prioritizing and
the answer is identical for beginner
intermediate advanced
it's just the beginners usually their
systemic mrv is so high
that it's above their some total mrvs
for
uh intermediate it starts to get into a
kind of
50 50 where sometimes they run into
stuff by advanced
very few advanced people can train all
their muscles and you eat an mrv all the
time
and they almost always have to if
they're interested in best results
do specialization programs james really
good answer and just to piggyback off dr
mike so you have kind of the systemic
fatigue
limitation right that we're talking
about between beginner and intermediate
advanced
but really uh kind of like one thing
that goes hand in hand with that is the
mev
requirements of all those different
groups and so one of the problems that
you run into this is the classic
intermediate conundrum is now your mev
is significantly higher than it was
when you were in a beginner where you
could train you know two to three times
per week
do a handful of sets per muscle group
and you'd get fantastic growth
now you're going to have to train
probably you know between four and six
times per week
and each session is going to be you know
appreciable in terms of the number of
sets maybe you have to start moving up
towards
eventually like eight to ten sets per
muscle group and so for most people
that starts to overwhelm their abilities
to recover whether it's locally or
systemically so
you have kind of the the twofold problem
of like
now you're you as you get as you
increase in your training age you get
stronger
right which is going to cause each one
of the lifts and exercises you do
to become increasingly disruptive which
taxes your systemic mrv more and more
and your mev is going up that whole time
so you have to do more to get the same
or not the same but you have to get do
more to continue stimulating robust
growth
so this is the intermediate conundrum i
can no longer train everything at once
what do i do
and that's when we say you know it's
probably not a bad idea to think about
doing a specialization phase
next up random username
says oh anonymous and mysterious yeah
hey docs i'm a complete lehman so please
bear with me as far as i'm aware joints
and connective tissues
are not as well innervated as muscles
just that's true does that mean
even if there is no noticeable pain
there's still some linear fatigue of
sorts that needs recovery in those types
of tissue not that there is
but that there could be and he says
thanks for the great content by the way
really enjoying your books and videos so
this is one of the situations why a feed
forward
um a non-auto-regulated fatigue
management is a good idea
and why james and i are big fans of
programmed
must take deloads and especially active
rests uh and low volume
re-sensitization periods on occasion
because some other folks
who we respect greatly will say that you
know you pretty much just rely on auto
regulation and if your performance is
going well
you continue to train harder if it dips
then you take deloads or whatever
the thing is is that you can't actually
tell when your tendons are frayed
or your ligaments are on like their last
little string sometimes you can
sometimes you just can't so regular
periods of like i know there's something
broken in my body i can't tell what it
is
if you take regular active rests and
resensitization periods literature is
pretty clear that doesn't slow down your
overall progress because when you take
some time away or time off or time
reduced
your sensitivity to hypertrophy goes up
and at least makes up
for the time you weren't uh training
hard james and i hypothesized it
actually
does a little bit more than make up it
accelerates the process but
you certainly don't lose any gains but
you essentially just reduce the fatigue
a ton and let those connective tissues
heal
so that you can have productive training
for another macrocycle without having to
worry in the back of your head like is
my next squat going to be the one where
my fucking
tendon comes off the bone and that's
you know people say but i feel fine i
think it's like with muscles yeah if you
feel fine that's probably fine
with connective tissues it's probably
not or sorry i'm sorry
um it's probably fine but uh could not
be fine that you would just be none the
wiser a lot of
the worst injuries that ever happened
happen completely
like people just have no idea that
they're even in that position and
they're at their strongest
and funny enough if your muscles are the
strongest your connective tissues
are you know insensitive enough to not
be able to tell if they're fucked up
you're a really nasty position where
your muscles just just strong enough to
pull the shit apart for you
and you could be none the wiser so
that's why proactive fatigue management
strategies
are a good idea because yeah i know
you're probably fine but on the off
chance you're not fine you really want
to make sure
you're taking enough breaks to let that
stuff heal james yeah absolutely so uh
one of the problems you find with
connective tissues as mike already
alluded to is
very often by the time you realize
something is wrong it's often too
late and you've already sustained some
kind of injury whether it's a grade one
two three either way by the time you
notice it it's already a problem
right not just like ooh my my elbow's a
little wonky today and sometimes you do
have that kind of stuff but more often
than not you're like
my elbow hurts and then it stays hurt
for a while and you're like fuck what
happened right
that's the innervation problem you also
have the problem of
most connective tissues are not as well
vascularized as
muscles as well so their healing time
course once they are significantly
damaged or irritated
is just significantly longer simply from
just a nutrient availability standpoint
so you kind of have a two-fold problem
where you're not always aware that you
might have a problem and if you do have
a problem
it just takes a little bit longer so as
dr mike was saying
we are into the proactive fatigue
management strategies
just to keep that at bay because when
you think about it
this is i think dr mike will agree here
you might be thinking like man this
deload is lame it feels like it's time
away from training
you know what's the worst time away from
training injury when you can't fucking
do anything because your shoulder or
your knee or your elbows fucked up right
and you tried to just auto regulate your
weight around it
and it just stayed perpetually injured
for a long time until it finally had
enough
and you had a significant injury and now
you're out right whereas this is like
a little bit of proactive light sessions
or deloading here or there
really can help keep you in the game uh
and effective for a very long time and i
think that's a much
better long-term trade-off than just
trying to auto-regulate your way around
connective tissue injuries yeah
absolutely all right next up
elliot
all right elena asks hey doc's loving
the content and i purchased your book
awesome
great my question is if a massing
mesocycle is a week long then you go
into a four week mini cut
do you have a chance of losing
preparatory hypertrophy gains well in
the mini cut
considering some of the gains you
acquired in the massing cycle have not
gone through
biofibrillar change so my best answer is
a lot of the uh stuff about preparatory
hypertrophy is speculative
it's not willing to put a lot of money
on it may be a really important feature
it may not be an important feature
what is probably true is that if you
continue to train
on the mini cut that actually does uh
very likely
power of that realization of hypertrophy
because you're still training hard
not with high volumes but with heavy
resistances getting close to failure
you're still challenging the system
that probably means your initial
hypertrophy that you gain in eight weeks
is going to be more solidified by that
eight-week medicine
the real problem and this is where you
see in the beginner literature
this kind of problem is doing eight
weeks of hypertrophy
and then just disappearing for eight
weeks which is probably by the way like
most college students train
which is why you see most college
students enter their freshman year a
certain level object
and then exit the same level object
because they lose essentially all the
muscle
because their muscle gains are not very
solidified and
uh because they're just not consistent
so i think if you did eight weeks
of massing and then you did 12 weeks of
cutting afterwards
it was your first ever mass phase or
mass to that level of uh
to that extreme you may actually lose
some muscle that you you don't gain back
until you gain it back fresh because of
that extreme dieting towards the end
but i think a four week mini cut is
totally fine um and i think it
will result in more of a coalescence of
that hypertrophy
um it's just the biggest thing you have
to worry about is like doing eight week
massing cycle and just fucking
disappearing for eight weeks
that will regress you back to almost as
if you've never done anything at all
and and that would be a real shame so i
think that's the best answer i have
james
yeah that was a great answer uh i would
just go to that next level and say
depending on how you have the setup so
like if you have
i'm trying to say this without being a
dickhead
my point is that i would try to go for a
longer stretch of mass before needing a
mini cut my question would be like why
did you need to mini cut only after
eight weeks that seems like an awfully
short
time for massing right now it's not to
say that that's bad or wrong you can
absolutely do that and that's okay
i think a better strategy might be like
massing for
12 15 weeks and then entertaining a mini
cut because you kind of have some
questions of like okay what were you do
did you need to re-sensitize your
muscles what was going on there did you
get too fat too quick
did you start too fat like you see you
see where i'm going with the questions
there's just a lot of reasons like why
did you do it that way
maybe it might be better to start leaner
and go for a longer stretch
and then doing it for longer also might
also be in your benefit in terms of some
of this
preparatory hypertrophy question as well
potentially
boom next up
eduardo never see so
god you know this guy is 100 in charge
of every mexican drug cartel
he is just the guy you don't watch this
guy he's the guy like when you try to
renegotiate rates in like a warehouse
with like assassin and a bunch of
barrels of coke the guy who's like is
selling you the coke he's like we could
call eduardo if you want you're like no
no no no please don't call mr salazar uh
these rates are totally fine we're just
gonna take the coke and we're gonna go
you're like you're like the lando in
that situation like this deal's getting
worse all the time
telling you i'm telling you lando's
demand
all right here we go hey doc's
question would it be beneficial to do
static stretches on the
antagonist muscles before strength
workout we know that static stretches
decrease the force output of a muscle
we also know that one of the neurologic
adaptations of strength training is
decreasing the activity of antagonist
muscles
so would this work thanks for the
content james
what do you think so yes there's
definitely some hint of truth to that
right
when you say static stretches decreases
the force output of a muscle
that can happen when it's done with
really really high
um durations and kind of volumes of
stretching so that doesn't happen under
most like kind of what i would call like
normal every day like people doing a
reasonable kind of warm-up and some
stretching
that's fine normally what we recommend
is doing a dynamic warm-up and not doing
a ton of static stretching
either way before doing any type of
exercise that doesn't seem to be the
best strategy because the muscle's not
warm not loose
and having that static stretch load just
doesn't seem to be as beneficial and
potentially more injury-prone
in terms of trying to uh static stretch
the antagonist
muscles i don't think that there's
that's going to be an efficacious use of
your time
i think your best uh setup for a really
good strength session
is going to be to do a dynamic workout
excuse me a dynamic warm-up
uh do some warm-up sets for whatever
movement that you're working on and go
from there it's kind of the same as with
most strength training whether it's
hypertrophy or or
explicitly strength i wouldn't spend a
lot of this is one of those like weird
are you going to get like a hack effect
from stretching your antagonist muscles
like
if you stretch your rhomboids are you
gonna have a bigger bench
absolutely not or at least not not to a
degree that would be
any way measurable noticeable tangible
to you so i would say don't bother
all right next up sorry
uh that last point i i i think i
understand a little bit more what he's
what he's getting at here with that last
point
so we're saying one of the adaptations
is decreasing the activity of the
antagonist muscle group yeah
um that's something that works itself
out over time that's not something where
so i'm putting two and two together here
so what you would have to do
in order to get that would be like spend
like an hour
every day doing some kind of like
rhomboid stretching for the purposes of
trying to increase your force output on
your bench
right that is not going to work
what happens is you just get less
co-contraction
as part of becoming more efficient at
the movement itself so what that means
is
the more you bench and the better your
technique gets at benching the less some
of the antagonist muscles become active
and that just works itself out you don't
have to actually do anything other than
focusing on your technique and getting
better
boom
that seems reasonable it could
potentially work maybe you can give it a
try
but a lot of stuff tends to happen on
its own with improved technique
um all right a man
who was genetically engineered into an
eel
that was itself engineered to be an
advertising machine
add eel oh oh slithers electrically
through the marketplace is he wearing
like a sombrero in this
what is going on in that picture with
the youtube pictures you don't know if
it's actually them or like some porn
star they're talking about
so like
um all right yeah at eel asks what are
your thoughts on minimalistic exercise
selections for an entire program
for example squat stiff like a deadlift
weighted dip in chin ups only oh oh
mike do it i know it's coming do it do
it do it
i hope i don't let you down oh i i we'll
see
don't let me talk
james i feel so much pressure i thought
you were going to go with um
like the stim like the str
f s f t r kind of route from the
hyperschool book and say read the
hypertrophy book because we talk about
that
we sure as hell dude yeah so we do talk
about this in a picture for
however as a beginner minimalistic
exercise selections are
excellent because beginners don't need a
ton of exercises
because they get such robust hypertrophy
because these exercises especially the
ones you picked which are compound
movements train so much of the body
and it lets beginners become very
competent of the core movements without
a lot of confusion
about different kinds of movements try
teaching a beginner a wide prevention a
close group pension the same as a cycle
and they fuck both of them
more often than not on the other hand if
you just change more regular judge
right once they know how to write a
bench really well then a 12 weeks later
you can teach them the close group and
the wide grip and they know exactly what
the difference is between the two
so these minimalistic programs are
basically the way to program for
beginners
as you become an intermediate you both
start to need
other things in your program like for
example if you want maximum muscular
development
just doing stuff like a deadlift
probably will get you the biggest
hamstrings
probably some sort of lag curl has to be
done and there's always research coming
around brad schoenfeld has some new
research actually
that just adds to a body of research
that says look like local hypertrophy
too specific to a type of exercise is a
real thing
like if you just do squats versus just
leg presses you miss out on some parts
of the quads to a small extent but
notable one
that if you do both exercises at some
point in your program right so ideally
you want more exercise selection
but here's the you know the biggest
impediment to this
is fatigue management okay so fatigue
management has drawn out through
variation
if you train legs twice a week you're
pretty strong
squatting twice a week for an advanced
lifter becomes a little bit
less tenable than it used to be it
re-irritates the same structures and
where you're so big you're so strong
connective tissues are so pounded in it
becomes really really tough
to just do these super compound heavy
basics and nothing else i mean if you do
weighted dips only
for your chest first of all your upper
chest isn't getting stimulated second of
all if you weigh 230 pounds
and you're doing weighted dips three
times a week your shoulders are going to
be on some kind of other shit
real soon so if you notice how
bodybuilders train they're the biggest
biggest biggest people in the world
which they have quite a bit of exercise
variation and quite a bit of isolation
movements
and quite a few like kind of pussified
movements that you're like really you're
doing that thing like cable flies come
on bro do heavy bench
well there's only so many times you can
have a bench in a week if you bench over
450 pounds i mean it's just going to
fuck you up so you're going to have to
train chest a bit more volume or more
often some combination of two you're
going to have to insert other exercises
that lead your overall stimulus to
fatigue ratio
to not be as high specifically through
that accumulated joint and connective
tissue fatigue
specific to those exercises so thoughts
on the minimalistic exercise selection
for an entire program great for
beginners
variation has to increase through the
intermediates it has to be peaked at
advanced james really good answer while
you were saying that stuff i had two
images that flashed through my head so
um mel and i mel had not seen pumping
iron so we watched it the other night uh
what yeah i know that's when i was like
i haven't seen any movies though
and this i've seen it like a hundred
times right at this point but uh the one
that always gets me is um
when you're talking about uh doing dips
for a chest is
there's a there's a couple scenes where
you see franco colombo and there's one
part where he's doing
bench with like 315 for like sets of 10
like it's nothing and then you see his
upper chest separation which is like so
incredible if you guys haven't watched
it yet
watch pumping iron and just look for
franco colombo's chest separation it's
incredible
legendary yeah but so getting getting to
the actual question yeah this is exactly
how you build beginner programs
you change the number of exercise
variations based on the need
right we don't change things arbitrarily
there always has to be a reason and a
need for doing it
and in this case you actually start to
see staleness and plateauing from a lot
of movements from using them for a long
time and then boom there you go there's
the need for having some
some variation the good news is as a
beginner you don't get that stillness
for a very long time you can ride the
same exercise variations
for a very long time largely because
you're new to training
and you're new to those movements
entirely so you're making not only
potentially gains in the muscles that
are being trained but you're just making
a lot of neurological adaptations at the
same time
which is a feed forward mechanism for
you just getting bigger and bigger and
bigger stimulus
every time you train so not only are you
actually seeing changes at the muscular
level you're seeing changes at the
nervous system level those tie into each
other and you just keep making a whole
fuck load of progress right at the
beginning that's why you get those rapid
beginner gains because you got those two
things going for you
your performance goes through the roof
right and then once you start tapping
those out a little bit
you start to see stillness and then you
gotta switch it up and that's when you
become
an intermediate hooray isn't
is an advanced training programs aren't
they so much fun
i want the advanced lifting program
motherfucker no you don't
you like doing 10 sets of everything and
switching exercises like
five times per muscle group it's awful
all right this is
how to know how long to active rest for
and whether you have deloaded enough to
start max mesocycle
two ways one is you start out with
general recommendations and then use
auto regulation around those
recommendations to tailor them to you
so general recommendations are a week
for dealering and oh about two weeks for
active rest
take them verbatim when you're a
beginner or immediate
and don't worry about if you're doing it
right just do it now
as you start to become more of an
intermediate than a beginner and then
more advanced
you're going to start to notice some
things ideally you want to start your
next
mesocycle or macro cycle depending on if
it's a deload or
active rest phase when you are
physiologically and psychologically
primed to do another hard
continuous cycle of training so what
does that mean
that means your joints feel pretty
fucking good after an act of rest
they should feel real good after a deal
at least good enough dude on the meso
your muscles should feel fresh you
should feel flexible
yeah that's actually one of the
interesting correlates of fatigue as
your muscular flexibility tends to go
down you tend to be more stiff
um and you should feel like
you can you know this is something you
you'll only find out if you come back to
the gym
but then you'll learn from next time you
do an active extra deload if you come
back and with relatively low reps
and sense you get a quick pump like whoa
holy shit
and you get sore from very little volume
that's how you know you're re-sensitized
to be ready to grow again and
everything's nice and healed up
psychologically you should feel like
you're fucking ravenous
you can't wait to train you wanted to
train two or three days ago but you know
the program wouldn't let you
if you feel anything short of that after
a deload especially after an active rest
phase
you need to rest longer so start out
with a week or
for a deload active rest for two weeks
then
as you do those note how you feel when
you feel and then eventually you can say
you know what like
my d loads need to become much easier
because i technically can only do a week
otherwise it throws off a program but i
really just need to do less during a
deload
because i feel way too beat up still
with the way i'm downloading now um
potentially you could do more you say
look my d loads
just most of it is just pissed away time
in the first half of my dealer i'm
actually going to train pretty heavy
that with low volume i think that'll
still work
great hello james and i will say airing
on the side of easier on de-loading is
almost always better
and then for active rest you know a week
and a half later you could be like dude
i'm literally just pissing away time at
this point
then you can only rest active rest for a
week and a half at a time that's totally
fine
but you may get to the end of the two
weeks and you're like i'm just starting
to relax
my elbow is just starting to feel better
but it's not a hundred percent now take
another week of active rest guys
if you take twice a year mike is retal
james hoffman promise if you take three
weeks of active rest twice a year
you will be as jacked as you could have
ever become taking two weeks or one week
or no weeks
you're not going to lose any muscle over
the net balance you're probably going to
be even better off okay most of your
favorite top pro bodybuilders
take an entire month or two off per year
at a time
sometimes more and because of all the
muscle comes back
and that read that healing that
reinvigoration that resensitization
psycho and physiologically is a
humongous fucking deal
that most people just don't know about
so absolutely 100 percent
take massive active rest oh by the way
all of your ufc fighters that you like
most of the year is active rust that's
probably not great
but they're still the best in the world
put it that way
so err on the side of more but if you
you know once you have the basics set in
look for those psychological
physiological signs
and they'll tell you if you know you're
uh doing
uh enough or if you're doing a little
too much james
yeah great answer uh quick tangent i
don't know if you saw the last ufc
speaking of but
max holloway put a fucking beating on
cater did you happen to see that
i i didn't see it but i heard it was
like legendary
yeah he like smashed some of the
all-time records for like number of
significant strikes thrown
and it was just easy it was one of those
things where you're watching it and
you're like i can't believe this is
happening um it was
it's worth re-watching if you get it
it's like a targeting robot like he was
just fine that face
it was kind of like watching somebody on
a heavy bag workout you're just like
okay he has to move out of the way every
now and again um but he's just
oh it was it was gnarly but yeah they uh
in terms of active rest yeah this is
something right you know like
you can definitely not do it it's
feasible for people to not take any
active rest especially if you're just
training physique stuff
i think it's a as mike said it's not a
bad idea to have maybe
one to two periods of active rest
throughout the year start with two weeks
go from there for me personally um the
physical stuff is
is fairly obvious at least in my
experience most people know like oh okay
i feel pretty good like
training feels good my body feels good
feel pretty healed you know with some
caveats like we mentioned
about like sometimes you don't know that
your connective tissues are fucked up
right so
with that in mind uh for me like the
really telling thing is the
psychological like does the thought of
going to the gym make you want to vomit
or
do you have anxiety thinking about going
and training does it actually cause you
to like
physically like tense up or you're like
oh i got training later today and like
i don't want to do that you need more
active rest right
that's going to be like one of the
biggest giveaways where it's like if
the thought of training makes you feel
unwell for and
i don't mean that to sound silly i mean
it literally like if it causes you
anxiety
fear any of those negative emotions
right
that's when you know you need more
active rest and i think that probably
trumps
in many ways a lot of other things or at
the very least is weight in my opinion
weighed very heavily so if people are
otherwise seem healthy and i'm like
you're ready to train and they're like
yes they're like okay don't let's not
worry about it why don't you just take a
couple more days
see how it goes and we'll try again
later and they go okay and then there's
you know you go from there and that's
when auto regulation can be really handy
where you say okay start with three
weeks
if by the end of the first week you just
want nothing more than to like train and
have sex then
you're good go go yeah right um
if you know two weeks in you're still
kind of like
jump rope makes you want to vomit don't
do it just keep waiting
all right next one is two down from
zacharia it is
the question here is creatine and
caffeine what's your view
on them not working well together and if
they don't how long apart from each
other should they be taken
so there is some of an interference
effect that i've seen in the literature
um and i will say
that you know you can take them
separately
but but here's a big but they're both so
cheap
that you can just take a little bit more
of each of them
and you get plenty of both and you're
good to go
what i don't like to see is like an
obvious shitting on this idea
where like a stupid pump up drink will
have creatine in it
so first of all creatine something you
take like every morning or every night
and it chronically accumulates over a
week and a half in your muscles and then
stays elevated as you keep taking it and
that's what gives you all its benefits
there's a loading phase
like there's nothing there are no acute
effects of ingesting creatine
caffeine is exclusively acute effects so
when like bang has creatine in it or
something i don't know if it does but
i'm sure they've made that clay before
it should be discovered that it hasn't
like i forgot what kind
right hcl or some shit yeah so
they you know when they put creatine and
caffeine purposefully together that's a
little fucking stupid
the easiest way to get no interference
effect if you're really worried about it
is to take creatine in the evenings just
every night before you go to sleep take
a scoop
of of creatine uh powder put it in your
mouth
put water in there swish it around and
swallow that's it y'all motherfuckers is
used to swishing around and swallowing
huh
shit it's gross so good
not powder i suppose but uh just
micronized get the micronized kind
that's right
when he's really dehydrated powder semen
um but like on a serious no that's an
easy solution
because there's no benefit to taking
creatine around your workout
that's anything to write home about that
an extra gram of creatine a day doesn't
fix
so if you're saying well i got to take
creatine post workout because the carb
up taking those studies
instead of taking five grams of creatine
at night just take six and you'll have
the same amount of intramuscular
creatures if you took five grams
creatine is basically free so um
that's how i would approach that if
you're really worried about it if you're
not really worried about it
just take six if you take creatine every
morning and you take your coffee or
whatever pre-workout every morning too
just take six or seven grams of creatine
instead of five and you're fucking good
to go
so either way it's just not this huge
problem until and unless they are
purposefully combined
into some kind of concoction which is
just a little bit short-sighted
so uh james yeah so this this really
only comes up i think
or it only really becomes an issue was
when people are using
their pre-workout as their main source
of creatine
which is kind of crazy right so like for
for me i
use both those things i just take my
creatine independent of anything else
that i'm doing right so it's always just
five grams of creatine and in my shake
that period doesn't change right if my
pre-workout
also has creatine in it but also has
caffeine
great i get a little bit extra is it
gonna do anything for me no
so those kind of just essentially just
cancels itself out if you just treat
them as independent entities right so
if you drink coffee and take a creatine
supplement keep doing that if you take a
pre-workout that also has creatine make
sure you're taking supplemental creatine
as well to make sure you're getting the
fullest effect but that's something that
we would kind of recommend that you do
anyway so
boom oh oh
look at this okay look at my screen this
is the machine that i have
mine's the 27 ton version and it's not
this looks almost looks purple but this
is it
oh split below it's got wheels and
everything yeah
trailer hitch
does your uh can can-am have a trailer
hook up or no
yeah oh dude i got to do some fucked up
shit the other day
so we had a big windstorm come through
and i had a bunch of trees go down and
one
had a really big one go down in the
little ravine where the creek is
which is fairly steep so i got to uh i
went down there with my neighbor we
chopped him up with a chainsaw and i put
the differential lock and the four wheel
drive on
and i was going up and down that ravine
with like 500 pounds of logs just like
holy shit oh sweet i was so amped it was
really fun that thing is earning its
colors huh
yeah well it's kind of fun because it
finally switched from like a watch to a
need because like i couldn't have used
any other vehicle to do that like the
truck
couldn't have done a jeep couldn't have
done it but that thing handled it like a
champ that's fucking sweet
it was sweet um actually i have a
question to ask you about the can-am
after we're done webinaring
oh sure yeah
next up is
[Laughter]
rosannovsky
i was going to say is that russian or
polish it's polish for sure
oh wait he does okay he says polish too
yeah
um all right miraslaf
that's as close as holy shit the winner
for today's webinar
yeah spicy name yeah yeah motherfuckers
thought you had cool names
so he says if one is doing a sixth day
well i lost uh six day push pull
legs split most other splits really but
this one is of interest to me
should their d ludwig consist of six
days of analogous training or could they
just smash those light sessions
into only two days of doing full body
while conserving the optimal positive
effects of deloading
if not which uh and how much within
those
may your lives be spent in a state of
personal preference
uh respect aspiring polish meathead edit
i'll add that i'm particularly
interested in the level of joint
connective tissue regeneration during
socialism prone to having these problems
you know what man to be completely
honest
when i do i i do a six day split except
i have like two days in there and stuff
and i think james does something pretty
similar what we usually do during
deloads
is we'll often do the first three
sessions but with much lower volume
as normal and then we'll just combine
the last three sessions into one session
on like a friday
and it's just whole body session that
takes like 30 minutes
and then the rest of that half week is
just time off and relaxing and eating
and sleeping
that's how i've done it it allows you to
check mark all of your volume and
intensity goals for the deload
but it also allows you to
psychologically get the fuck away from
the gym a little bit more and really
recycle
for your next as a cycle uh james yeah
that that's definitely something that i
would do what dr mike said
at first i wasn't sure if he meant like
just take two days of d-load but i think
what he meant is take your normal week
and then just
make it two two sessions of that week is
that yeah yeah okay i think so
so that's fine too um yeah i would be
very hard pressed to say like that's any
better or worse than a lot of other
strategies
the thing for me and i think this is
just a personal preference and
maybe you mirror slav maybe you don't
have the same issue is that um
i am a creature of habit so i like to
have a routine
and i like to keep things the same even
if it's a d
load i like to wake up have my caffeine
it's winter i make a fire we take the
dogs out and i like to go
do my gym stuff first thing in the
morning done then move on to the rest of
the stuff so
for me there's like a consistency factor
uh that is just it's repeatable and it's
it's makes me feel better about my week
and my productivity and stuff like that
that's up to you if that doesn't bother
you at all and you can if you want to do
two days
that's fine um i
mike i i have a hard time saying that he
should do like maybe upwards of four
days because i really don't think it
matters a ton like two days is
definitely better than zero
can i say that two days is better than
three or four days ah
not really meh you can even do as few as
two
yeah i would say no less than two would
make most sense
um one heaviest day one lightest day
yeah spread evenly and then you're good
yeah agreed all right
ben paulman
very vanilla name to follow up seriously
says hey docs when hypocaloric is
exercise variety important to maintain
muscle
or is it only required to grow muscles
optimally if a doctor might say
something along lines that to maintain
exercise variety isn't as important
the supply for being hypochloric too we
can't find an answer in your books
thanks guys
so to maintain under iso calorie
conditions exercise variety is not as
important
to maintain under hypocaloric conditions
i think you need to have the normal
exercise variety that covers all of your
fundamental
movement pattern and muscle fraction
basics
so for example if you're cutting and
you're not doing any incline work
you're going to lose some clavicular
pack mass if you're not doing any leg
curling you're going to lose part of
your hamstrings
um mass that that that stiff flicker
that's another hip hinges just don't hit
so there is a minimum threshold there
where you need enough variation to hit
all the basic
functions and parts of your muscles but
that's not that's not that much
variation that's like two to three
different so for pecs i'll tell you it's
so simple a flat or decline press
some kind of incline move and a fly move
is
all you need to maintain ultimate pack
size
throughout a cut but if you like do an
entire cut and you don't do any fl
flies especially when you contract your
pecs at the top
you might be missing a little something
so i would say that's my best answer for
that
yeah and you might be just uh ben might
be looking at this like too rigidly in
terms of the phrasing
so right the variation is important so
that you're
managing your volume landmarks well in
terms of the balance of performance and
staleness right
and so the reason why it's important
during a cut is because if you don't
have some kind of variation periodically
what you end up doing is just building
up a really really huge
mev for whatever movements that you're
using
which is going to become more and more
systemically taxing during a cut and you
don't have a lot of wiggle room to play
with on a cut
as you would like on a mask where
there's a lot of room to you can kind of
if you wanted to just keep a movement in
because you're grooving on it really
hard and even though your mev is already
up to like six sets
but it's still going well like that's
okay on a cut there's a definite there's
a there's a big cost benefit analysis
you have to make there and saying
i have to do a shitload of this one
thing just to get anything out of it
anymore uh that's energy and time that i
could be getting the same effect
from doing like two sets of something
else um which would make me a hell of a
lot less tired during this cut
so it's definitely important in both
senses but there's no
i wouldn't say there's any particularly
special considerations as mike already
said
it's just the normal amount of variation
needed for stimulating robust growth
all right you got to scroll way down for
this one it's
orange letter c chris this
chris this oh god
chris asks and chris is our last
question asker for today
for someone who wanted more steps on
their day off
15k instead of 10k and not want to spend
a ton of time walking
but going fast in the elliptical cause
less fatigue slash interference for
lifting
or to be better off doing a slow jog or
just suck it up and go for longer walks
thank you
uh thank you sirs okay so your best
option is going for longer walks
that's the lowest fatigue less the least
interference however you
sort of have ruled that out because you
don't want to spend time walking so
we're just going to narrow in now on the
two options you've left us
jogging or elliptical elliptical beats
jogging by a fuck ton
because it has no impact um jogging
especially the
worst it's a fucking awful jogging's
always the worst
whenever you think about jogging whether
it's weight training cardio
whatever like don't jog run or don't
yeah for sure jogging is is a great way
to not burn that many calories but still
give your knees a good what for uh
so yeah elliptical is a really really
good choice
and it's you don't even have to go that
fast in the elliptical first you start
burning some fucking serious cows and
for your step count to go through the
roof
most step counter watches also and your
phone will register stops on the
elliptical
and they they come pretty quick so the
elliptical
is a great idea there and if you just do
5k
steps on the elliptical every day man
that's uh you're well on your way
to to burning some serious fat so i
think that's your probably best option
the elliptical is like
the hidden gem of fat loss that for not
interference
because they managed to make a whole
body machine so it spreads the effort
over tons of muscle groups
and one that doesn't have it burns lots
of calories and it's
basically no impact that's incredible
you know like you just can't get
that through many other sources so um
yeah there you go yeah elliptical's
definitely a really good one on a very
similar note i'm a big fan of the
assault bike similar idea very low
impact it's all concentric movement
which is really nice you just push with
one leg push with the other
push with one arm pull with the other
like you do there's no eccentric loading
so the amount of actual like structural
damage is pretty low
if you are not used to cycling it will
crush your legs the first couple times
once you get conditioned to it a little
bit it's a great alternative but i think
in terms of low impact it's like walking
elliptical
assault bike and then fill in anything
else and then jogging's at the end
at the very bottom of the list that's
the worst yeah
unless well i'm just fucking around now
but we can
surmise that even worse than jogging is
like doing frog hops for your cardio
skydiving without a parachute yeah
dynamic bounding
[Laughter]
all right so that was it i think for the
questions right
that's it okay so i have a couple things
uh folks
so we had a couple really good book
releases lately the hypertrophy book
came out
dr davis's aka doctor wife's book came
out
um so she's gonna do an audiobook
version of her
book as well just like kind of how nick
did his and
one thing i wanted to ask you guys for
all of you listeners is if you have any
really
good questions about mel's book or the
topics in mel's book which is about like
behavior change and habit formation
if you have any other interesting
questions that you want to talk about
i'm just taking a few just to get some
talking points on the audiobook because
i'm going to do an interview with mel on
her book
as part of like a feature at the end of
the audiobook so if you guys have any
interesting talking points or questions
just go ahead and shoot them to me on
instagram i'm at uh
rp dr james and you can just label it as
saying hey question about mel's
audiobook or question about mel's book
that would be really helpful for me
especially if you guys have read the
book and there were things that more
things that you wanted to know
or interesting points that you wanted
clarified or even just some insights
from mel's research and things that
she's done
would love to hear any questions that
you guys have and you can just shoot
them to me
on my instagram and i'll take note of
them um
sometimes you know they will come up as
you know message requests but i'll do my
best to at least acknowledge that you
sent them if
if you do send one and i'll try and
compile a nice list of questions
oh mike you got anything
uh tons more youtube stuff coming out um
other than that um
funny joke for you guys so joey sat mary
of sat strength is probably gonna come
out to vegas and do a collab with us for
a couple youtube videos
and our videographer scott is like joey
i got it um strongman versus desert
we drop you off in the desert with
nothing but a protein bar and a dumbbell
and see if you can make it back to
civilization
my protein bar is melted
no that's problem number one that is
actually wow
and then the weight is too hot to touch
yeah what are you gonna do with that
weight
poor survival it's a strong man you know
do your thing it has to be a challenge
right so it has to be like an atlas
stone and he has to bring it back to
vegas somehow somehow it has to arrive
back in vegas
oh my you know you're better off rolling
it right that's absolutely the easiest
answer
yeah i was doing montana strong man i
had to cut down a bunch of stumps so i
was doing atlas stumps
in my yard stacking them up those shits
are big they're like a hundred pounds
it's heavy dude fuck that are you
lifting it up yourself or are you using
a machine yeah
i mean i'll lift them to like stack them
and stuff but and sometimes i'll load
them in like the can-am just to drive
them around but
yeah i'm it's it's it's strong man style
it's fun
so my arms are fucked up but i try to
lift i literally
couldn't do my back workout the other
day because i had been doing atlas
stumps and i went to go do bent rows and
i was like no
not happening dude fuck that it fries
you yeah
so all right if that's it i think we're
gonna wrap this one up guys
great questions as always make sure you
subscribe to the youtube channel if you
have any questions for mel on her habit
book
shoot me some instagram messages and if
not talk to you next time
thanks for joining us peace
