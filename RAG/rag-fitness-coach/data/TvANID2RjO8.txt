you are dieting through the holidays for
some for some goddamn who knows reason
but not so seriously no competition
coming up nothing crazy my suggestion to
you in this case is to take three or
four pre-planned fun holiday cheat meals
and make them on special times and
another huge tip is don't sit there
snacking that's how you can get your
calories to go super crazy and throw you
off of your fat loss plan because
remember you're in a fat loss phase
don't sit there eating potato chips or
um Cheetos or something like that
because good God you can pound the
calories away not even notice so make
sure these are distinct meals make a
meal eat it slow log it be done with it
and that's good to go
