oh
oh dog
is a dream
hello youtube
how are you today
i'm here with dr mike isratel and we're
going to do a casting couch interview
that's just a joke uh so i'm going to be
putting you guys through
my
whole uh third week pool session my
messa cycle this is my first
serious messa cycle after my competitive
my debut season as a pro in the ifbb uh
i will be training with my training
partner and new roommate dough park
sadly mike is in michigan with scott the
film guy
and they left
me uh so today will be my vertical
emphasis day and i'll be putting you
guys through the session with me and
probably talking a lot of shit on mike's
technique in the background
debut season yeah i guess that's what
the casting couch sounds like you have a
lot to prove i yeah you know
he'll do anything to prove the
higher-ups that he can i can do this
this is open-ended
it's in the gym
[Music]
the first exercise generally
is some form of a high row
uh we're just gonna do lat pull downs
today i was gonna do pull ups elbow
hurts and whenever something hurts i
just don't do the exercise that i was
going to do guys it's kind of that
simple don't train and exacerbate the
injury so i have a little bit of elbow
pain going on
we're just going to do some lat
pulldowns feels a little better than
pull-ups for me
currently and then probably down sets
with like a giant set or something
and
a row of some sort so here we go
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
when i am traveling obviously i just
discussed how i have to change the
exercise a little bit
i'm continuing to the most similar
movement pattern that i can um
as far as what we usually do
so
when you have to change machines
people sometimes ask me like oh how do
you do it what do you like they freak
out a little bit they're like oh but
novel stimulus it's like the fibers
don't know the weight that you're using
i know the machine's different this
140 right now is probably
160 on the machine we used back in
powerhouse in in vegas but they just
know tension
so if you can feel a weight that feels
similar that's why you work up and you
potentiate so you go up to a working
weight do a couple reps come back down
and then do your working sets
and you can feel a similar tension on
the fibers then you're fine the weight's
not going to matter and if you can get
within the similar rep range which is
why tracking's important
uh if i did 16 on my first set and i can
get roughly 16 17 on my first set here
then i'm probably okay and it's just
probably a similar amount of tension on
the fibers uh as last week so don't
freak out if you switch machines because
you're traveling and i also love
traveling to tons of gyms all the time
so i'm always using different machines
let's just pick the exercises of the
most similar and then make sure that
you're working up and you're actually
warming up and potentiating with certain
weights so that way you can feel what is
similar to the other machine that you
were using
all right smoke that stretch good
a little more a little slower on the way
up stop stop milk it knock it there it
is
beautiful dog don't swing
straight down
there you go
you got one more
good good shit
[Music]
i'm mike i had an acute injury to my pec
so i have to not retract when i bench
press
those are really good
thank you
don't get that on camera i didn't just
compliment mike
next we will be doing the same thing but
it's with less weight
and you're going for the rep target this
is a giant set
rest pause whatever you want to call it
uh short rest periods
30 seconds to a minute
going for 50 reps today uh 55 to 60 next
week
and the weight stays the same so i did
this machine feels a little lighter so i
actually did 100 pounds in the one back
at a powerhouse so i'm doing 130 today i
was 30 pounds above on this
for the last stuff and i got pretty
similar rapid targets so
uh
50 reps probably 15 to 20 on the first
then a 30 second pause and i'll finish
mine out and then doug will go and he'll
do his
so
[Music]
shhh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no it wasn't
[Music]
next is a low row variants most of these
machines are like the exact same as
their plate loaded
so probably gonna be similar weight that
we did in powerhouse in vegas
uh
this model is fairly similar to that one
so i believe i do
two plates per side uh it's
a double arm row so i'm not doing any
sort of isolate like isolateral bullshit
uh
15 to 20 reps on these sets i've got
three sets of these
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
oh
protraction retraction
beautiful big chest at the top
squeeze
perfect
[Music]
a lot of people miss
either the very top portion or the very
bottom portion of the lift
then they come with all kinds of
bullshit reasons as to why it's not
biomechanically advantageous
full of shit
full stretch at the top peak contraction
big chest
that's how you get the most out of a
back exercise
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
oh dawg
so this rate everybody kind of knows
i lose from the back
uh because of my back not because of my
glutes or hamstrings tell you that much
but i lose from the back quite often
um
i would be placing quite a bit higher in
these shows if my back was better so
basically
i have two and a half back sessions per
week
uh for my massing period coming up
that's going to be
two sessions one's vertical once
horizontal emphasis
and then i throw back and again
uh
it's at the end of one of my pushing
sessions i believe
i'm doing one row exercise one
vertical pulling exercise and it's just
each sort of
disruption
to the tissue
it has an sra curve
and what i'm about recovered again is
when i'm hitting my back and basically
hitting any muscle group
but what i've had to do is take
a couple of muscle groups and put them
on maintenance volume so i could
increase my back volume so that goes
quads obviously because my legs are too
big for classic is what they say
um
so quads are on maintenance back volume
goes up
and uh there's added back volume in
another day that kind of gives me you
know back rest day rest day rest from
back anyway i'm back again
so there's back two days between back
and then one day between my necks back
because it's not as much volume
so this is my
uh
second back session of my
microcycle
and i'll have a third one after my next
pushing session which is in two days
so
that's kind of how i'm emphasizing
my back thickness for the next
who knows six months eight months we'll
see
until i give another shot so
uh speaking of back thickness
there's an albino gorilla in the gym
that was the back session uh
probably saw my new training partner
doug with his beautiful chris technique
i don't gotta deal with that bullshit
anymore all the jerking for mike isrtel
multiple kinds of jerking some of it's
good you know what i'm saying
hopefully next time i get on stage i
have a
a better back for the judges so when
they judge me they can judge my back
really well
but uh that's all for this session
might get another video or two in while
i'm down here in michigan visiting my
bffs
scott especially i was mostly talking
about scott
uh what is doug doing by the way what is
duck doing he's gonna kill himself
this guy this guy all right there goes
my training partner everybody
fucking hell
fucking animal
fucking animal
all right well that's all for that
youtube
catch you next time
