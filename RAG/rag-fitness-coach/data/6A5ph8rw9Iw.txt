hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization rp
plus hypertrophy concepts and tools
lecture number 20 training method
variation
so what we're going to do today is we're
going to talk about what the fundamental
training methods
are there are specific number of them
and we're going to talk about
how you can use the various training
methods
more and less depending on the situation
you find yourself in
so basically the tl dr is someone would
say this lecture would answer a question
someone would have of like you know
should i do straight sets or down sets
or drop sets when do i do mayo reps
when is occlusion a good idea when is it
not those are all questions that this
lecture is exactly designed to answer
when do you use what training methods
and
for what reason so let's take a look so
first we have a list of training methods
and it's not you know sort of names
like you know concurrent periodization
or something like that
it's just ways of essentially doing sets
of training
and we refer to them in the upcoming
hypertrophy book as training methods is
the most direct way to refer to them you
can call them whatever you like
modalities we've
used that term before methods is pretty
straightforward so
the first one is straight sets you just
do like a set of whatever number of reps
whatever
degree from failure like a set of ten
you rest a conventional amount of time
until your four factor rest model says
you can go again
and then you go again super
straightforward and you know usually as
people say two to three minutes rest
between sets that's sort of typical for
straight cents
down sets are straight sets except
though with a slightly reduced weight
often between 10 and 20 percent off of
the original load so that's like when
you do
you know squats with 315 pounds for sets
of 10 ish
and then when you like drop below sets
of eight you're like well i need more
volume and i still need
uh i want to control the weight i still
want to do roughly sets of 10
then you drop to 275 pounds and you do
another two or three sets
of roughly 10 reps those count as down
sets
right and then giant sets are
interesting and not everyone uses this
um terminology they've been called
marathon sets before
giant sets are sets in which you set a
total rep number you pick the weight
you need to do as many sets as it takes
whatever amount from failure
that you want to get to that total rep
range so you pick up the dumbbells
to do lateral raises you pick up the 20s
and say i'm going to do this for a total
of 50 reps
no matter how many sets it takes the
cool thing about giant sets
is because you know you're going to hit
sort of
pretty close to failure on each each set
but you don't have exact reps to match
from the last week
you just have a total rep number to hit
it's much easier to sort of decompress
there and
really focus on your technique your mind
muscle connection but you
have an objective measure of how much
work there is to get done because if you
use every set in your program
as just feel each rep out and you know
sort of when you get tired you stop
a lot of times it means you're not
pushing yourself hard enough or pushing
yourself too hard on sets
and it results in a lot of ambiguity but
with giant sets because you have a fixed
rep number
you know like okay last week i did 50
total reps this week i'm going to do 55
next week i'm going to do 60 but each
one of the mini sets between
between which you take a normal amount
of rest by the way you can just focus on
getting the exact
awesome mind muscle connection hitting
everything you have to really focusing
on technique
not worrying about how many reps you get
in a single set but you know that
they're all going to add up to the same
thing at the end
definitely some upsides and downsides of
when to use that when not to
next uh training method is agonist
supersets
um antagonist supersets are when you do
like bicep curls and then superset of
tricep extensions different muscles
antagonistic
they essentially produce different
functions or opposing functions
agonist supersets are when you do
usually uh one muscle in an isolation
style
and then the same muscle and a compound
style after to continue to take that
muscle and train it
beyond where it would normally fail so
for example tricep push downs
superset two push-ups right on the
ground right after with no rest
that's an ag and a superset targeting
the triceps right so that's another
modality or another method
and then we have three more
methods but they're very related we can
just call them the rest pause methods
they are my rep sets in which you do a
set of 10 to 20
rest several seconds and do progressive
sets of 5 to 10 reps
resting several seconds between each one
with the same load
drop sets are almost exactly the same
thing except you rest a little shorter
and you drop the load every single time
by you know roughly 10
or so and then occlusion sets are
exactly like mile wraps
but you're occluding the distal limbs so
occluded form sets or if you do
wrist curls but you have a band around
the your elbow occluded calf training so
on and so forth exactly like my reps but
we have to make note that the occlusion
changes some things
the timing is almost exactly the same
though that's just the general category
of rest pauses but we will refer to each
one of these maya reps
drop sets on occlusion sets uh
separately for various points
going forward so that those are our
training methods that's pretty much
the fundamental way that you come to the
gym and you say i'm gonna build muscle
you're gonna be doing one or some
combination of these
our next question is when is it a good
idea to do some when is it an okay idea
to do some and when
some of these may not be ideally fit for
the job
so the first by far most important
method of varying these training methods
or sort of direction of variation
is by individual stimulus to fatigue
ratio so you basically use
all these methods to some extent you
certainly try all of them on more or
less every muscle group you have
just through normally using variation
and training right several years
after you've started training you've
probably tried most or all these for
most or all of your muscles right
and you notice which training methods
seem to give you a better stimulus to
fatigue ratio in
the muscle group in which you're
targeting for example you could have
done like occlusion for hamstrings and
been like i don't know man
it doesn't seem like it's doing anything
it doesn't give me a great pump doesn't
seem to disrupt the muscle much
i don't really feel mind muscle
connection going i have no idea what's
going on
but then you do straight sets of low
reps with
stiff legged deadlifts or good mornings
oh my god that's the greatest thing i've
ever done for my hamstrings on the other
hand
for forearms you know you could do an
occlusion set and be like holy crap this
is blowing me up this is incredible
but you do straight sets resting two or
three minutes between each forearm set
five to ten wrist curls and you're like
this is stupid like i don't even feel a
pump i have no idea anything's happening
it just hurts my joints this is dumb so
after a while
you're going to figure out which methods
have on average better sfrs per muscle
group and it really ends up being
like a real thing for example for myself
um agonist supersets
for pecs do almost nothing for me they
just make me tired because i think i
have predominantly
faster twitch packs as my hypothesis but
heavy
straight sets and down sets of barbell
work in the 5 to 10 10 to 15 rep range
blows me up like nothing else it's
incomparable
so i've learned over the years that you
know i'm probably not going to be doing
a whole as
you know occlusion with chest is
impossible right i'm probably not going
to be doing a whole lot of drop sets my
wraps or agony supersets that stuff just
generally tends to tire my chest out
without a huge stimulus it's like the
equivalent of jogging
you know for quads that is that's what
it is for my chest but straight sets
are amazing downsides are amazing and so
on and so forth so i've learned that
and just the same way you can begin to
use the methods more that have the
highest stimulus to fatigue ratios for
that muscle groups you have a muscle
group that really responds well
to straight sets or down sets then
you're well on your way right but if you
have another muscle group that really
really likes myorb so on and so forth
and use
more of those things right and because
you use more of some methods you're
going to use other methods less
now that's not a continuing process that
happens forever you don't say okay my
chest responds the best
two straight sets so i'm going to use 75
of my chest straights at work
remember stillness is a thing sfrs
really interact with staleness
where stainless decreases the magnitude
of the stimulus and raises the magnitude
of fatigue for every step that you do
so eventually you do enough barbell work
or enough straights at work for pecs you
might be in a position where it used to
be an
amazing way to train for you and now
it's a decent way to train
and now maybe some of the maya rep stuff
some of the occlusion stuff et cetera et
cetera maybe not for pax
keep saying occlusion some of the my rep
stuff drop sets maybe even uh agonist
supersets
now they because of variation because of
novelty they have been used for a while
they may actually
have a competitive sfr to the old tried
and true stuff you have been doing
so maybe every now and again every you
know five to six months or something
like that once or twice a year
you use all those other modalities but
remember that they don't mix with you
nearly as well and the only thing really
holding them up
is their novelty is the fact that
they're not stale so while you may be
able to if
you know your chest is like mine use
straight sets
for most of your chest work for months
and months and it only like gets
stale really slow at some point you know
these things are rising these
other modalities drop sets for example
are rising in their uh
or their stillness is going down because
you haven't used them in so long and
they're novel
at some point there's a crossover but
remember because those aren't great
modalities for you or great training
methods
they're going to dip down maybe after a
mesocycle maybe after two
so you might only be able to get a mesa
cycle of good drops at work for your
pecs or a good
um uh isolation uh superset a good ag
and a superset
and then after a month or a month cycle
of training but you know what man
towards the end of that i wasn't feeling
shit and i had to do like 20 sets or
15 sets per workout to get anything and
so clearly this is super stale already
but
you've bought yourself a meza cycle of
refreshing the stuff that used to work
for you straight sets you go back to
mostly straight set training and all of
a sudden
there's new life in your training and
it's feeling really really good so this
kind of process
is going to result but on average over
the year over the years
you're going to use more of the sfrs
that are higher on average
and less of the ones that are not right
this here is the core of training method
variation it's the fundamentally what
you should be doing
and when people say or when they ask you
know should i be using more straight
sets for legs
or should i be using more drop sets
there are some generalities to convey
and we'll talk about them in a bit but
really a ton of the stuff has to come
down to the individual
not so much trial and error it's a bit
of like an insulting term for what's
going on
careful planning of training execution
auto regulatory feedback
to note what the sfr relative scores
are for all of these different training
methods and finding out which ones work
best for
you because never in a million years
would i say only straight sets for
lunges never super set lunges with
anything
you use superset lunges something it's
an unbelievable pump
unbelievable soreness with minimum
volume and you know mind muscle
connection is completely insane
what am i going to tell you that you're
wrong of course not right everyone's
different all muscles are different
uh to some extent you have to find what
works best for you
just pay attention to the sfrs shouldn't
be that hard and you're going to find
some training methods for some muscle
groups that work better than others
all right next variation is
by exercise type
so for example some of these
methods require a low rest time and not
all exercises are compatible with that
because for some exercises
the amount of cardiovascular synergistic
and nervous system fatigue generated
between
sets or after a set is massive
and it tends to be a limiting factor
until minutes and minutes and minutes
after
uh you've begun rest so that the actual
target muscle can become the limiting
factor again
so some approaches to training for some
muscles
uh just not super super compatible uh
with the rest times that they are being
allotted so for example
if you want to do agonist supersets
right
like tricep extensions supersets of
push-ups if you want to do my reps if
you want to do drop sets
and if you want to do occlusion sets
then you probably can't do them super
well
with at least three kinds of exercises
exercises that have a high
axial limiting factor one in which your
spine is being crushed all the time
and that tends to mean that you if you
take short rest breaks the axial
factor is the limiting factor and you
just can't produce a lot of force
anymore because you're so fucking tired
so barbell presses standing you're not
gonna do my reps with those
because if you do a set of 20 and then
five seconds later you try to do a set
you're gonna do a set of like one or two
you're gonna feel like you're being
crushed your spinal stability is gonna
be what's going on your front delts
aren't gonna feel a thing and you're
gonna say man that was not very
realistic
right secondly if exercises have a lot
of synergist limiting factors other
muscles
they get very tired after a set that
need the rest of they're not limiting
factors anymore
that's not that great for these uh
agonist supersets my reps drop sets and
occlusion sets
so for example barbell rows my reps and
barbell rows
are a hilarious idea because you'll do
the first set send 220 is going to feel
great then you're going to stand up and
you're going to rest five seconds and
when you lean back over you're gonna
realize that your spinal erectors are
the only thing limiting you at that
point
because they're so tired your lats and
all the other pulling muscles could have
a great workout
if you rested another minute or two or
whatever for your spinal erectors to
really really cool off
but because you have such synergist
fatigue here different if you were doing
a chest supported row like you could do
my reps or that because your spinal
erectors can be almost completely
isolated out of the movement
not so much with a barbell row so when
people say you know should i do my reps
for barbell rows
the answer of probably not is rather
obvious as to why the muscle
target the pulling muscles in the back
are not going to be limiting factors
the stability spinal erector musculature
will be
lastly and this is a no-brainer uh
exercises in which a cardiovascular
limiting factor is very relevant
are absolutely uh mostly off-limits uh
at least to some extent for agonist
supersets at least as being a first
exercise
uh maya reps drop sets and occlusion
sets mostly
they can still be used to some extent
but for example deadlifts
right my reps and deadlifts actually
make no damn sense at all because after
once that you're just going to fall over
and be breathing so heavy you can't pick
anything up you may be not even able to
stand up after a cyclist or failure of
deadlifts
in the 10 to 20 range holy crap right
drop sets of deadlifts i don't even know
how that would work
right you would it was such a huge
cardio component you would have to take
so much weight off every single drop set
that it would render the exercise
fundamentally meaningless and it would
be a cardio limiting factor every time
so you would do work but that work would
never be limited by the local
musculature you're targeting
and thus the stimulus is going to be not
so great that's actually a pretty good
cardio stimulus
but remember this these lectures are not
about getting cardio training they're
about hypertrophy
squats are another one where you got to
be really careful they can work with
some of these
but if you're doing drop sets of squats
man after a second or third drop set
it's all cardio limiting factor
if you don't have a lot of equipment or
something like that if you can modify
the exercise to some extent
yes that can work but generally not your
first choice for these kinds of training
methods right
so that's the training methods so for
those exercises
straight sets down sets and to some
extent giant sets are absolutely the way
to go
right not these other uh rest pause
type sets and not uh the
uh agonist supersets those are not such
a good idea for those exercises but
there are other exercises which are not
really very systemically
limited and if you do straight sets down
sets
and giant sets with them they still work
but a lot of times it's just like a
pissing away a lot of time
you ever seen someone do calf raises on
a machine and then rest like two or
three minutes and then do another set of
calf raises
you start to think like what the hell
are you resting two or three minutes for
you're gonna get a really effective set
if you rest like 10 seconds
like you're just resting for too long
and there's no point and sometimes
some of these uh factors like foreign
musculature for example
probably slower twitch probably responds
best to a metabolite accumulation
and if you rest a long time between
forearm sets you actually don't even get
a very good pump you don't get a lot of
metabolites and you may not get as
robust of a hypertrophy response
as if you rested for way shorter and
even if it's the same response you can
save like
minutes and minutes and minutes off
every workout by just going faster so
machine isolation exercises cable curls
cable push downs cable laterals can be
done
with uh super sets my reps drop sets and
occlusion sets and maybe inefficiently
done
poor stimulus to time ratio uh with
straight sets downsets and giant sense
so
you know if you're doing straight sets
barbell
uh upright row sounds great down sets
barbell upright row sounds great if
you're doing cable upright row and you
have the ability to move
uh selectorized parts because remember
with a barbell you have to go around
change the weights go back it's a huge
pain in the ass and it's more stability
required from your body so again there's
a cardiovascular component the nervous
system limiting component
with cable upright rows like if you're
doing them i don't want to say you might
as well be doing them
with these rest pause techniques but gee
give it some thought it might be the
best use of your
time and it's certainly the opposite of
off limits probably encouraged
lastly there's two two muscle groups you
can think of which
for a stimulus to time ratio and
maximization and just not drive you
insane
uh can be trained mostly with
the drop set variance or sorry with the
uh rest pause variants
maya reps drop sets
and uh occlusion sets the occlusion is
you know sort of when you have
the wherewithal and the plan to get the
bands going but definitely
lots of maya reps and lots of drop sets
for calves and forearms right
because cavs and forms in the very
unique position that they have almost
no systemic limiting factor like your
nervous system doesn't you have to try
that hard training cabs and forums you
you know it takes you several seconds
after a set to be like okay
i can do another heart set right
cardiovascular limit on calves on forums
good god i sure hope you don't have one
of those then you need to get getting
way better cardio shape
and these um for most machines and most
setups training cabs and forums
there are no synergist limiting factors
but there are no so for example if you
sit
in a calf raise machine a proper calf
raise machine which you push through
your hips and through your toes
the calves actually do not have any
synergists this is just calves
as a limiting factor so if you rest long
enough for the lactic acid to go away
and the calves don't hurt anymore which
could be like five seconds
you'll go huh actually i can do a great
set right now when you do it that ends
up technically counting as a myorep set
but my reps and straight sets for
muscles like cavs and forum are
very very similar looking what you don't
want to do with calves if you like to
maximize your time spent outside of the
gym is do cabs for a set of 10 and then
rest for like two or three minutes and
then do caps for a set of 10.
i'm willing to posit there's a 50 50
chance that's actually less hypertrophic
than doing them closer together for
roughly the same volume but it almost
certainly
will cost you tons and tons of extra
time even if it's not
a hypertrophy downside so give some
thought to that the basic tldr of this
slide is
not all of these training methods are
for every exercise
right you don't you you don't look at uh
you know calf raises and think okay are
we doing straight sets today
down sets today are we doing my websites
today one of those
or two of those answers might be way
better than the other on average and you
don't look at deadlifts and say all
right well
you guys think occlusion deadlifts like
that's just really ridiculous
some exercises fit way better with some
training methods
than others right
variation by placement in a session that
is
when do we do the training method
is it at the beginning of the session
the middle of the session towards the
end
can have an effect on maximizing
hypertrophy none of these are hard rules
they're just general trends and
directions we want you to think about
concepts and tools
right here are some facts absolute
strength is the highest in the early
part of a session
period okay you're not hitting any
deadlift pr's at the end of your session
unless you always deadlift the end of
the session then if you just stopped
doing that and started deadlifting in
the beginning
you would hit pr's automatically no
matter how strong you were because you
have that much more energy
right so absolute strength is the
highest in early part of the session and
it's pretty convincing that faster
twitch fibers are the least fatigued at
the early part of the session relative
to slow twitch intermediate twitch
fibers
which just generally aren't as
fatiguable so
in other words the big hint here is if
you really want to knock out
the faster fibers you better focus your
faster fiber
style of training early you don't want
to get to the second half or
third you know fraction of the workout
and say now it's time to hit
the faster fibers no no no if you've
been training that muscle group with
other things
up until that time with other methods
your faster fibers might not even turn
on much because they're so fatigued
and there's so much metabolite around
they don't even contract right really
really bad idea
and lastly
technique on heavy compounds that
require lots of balance deadlifts squats
overhead presses rows etc
is best in the early part of the session
because the link between technique and
acute fatigue
is like one of the most rock-solid
findings in all sport science as you
tire through a workout
minute 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes
60 and so on
your ability to to execute a high level
of technical proficiency
deteriorates right which is why like in
a combat sport learning a new technique
at the end
of a very long practice is a bad idea
because you're going to suck at it
you're going to suck at learning it
just the same way and a lot of
bodybuilders are very intuitively
caught into this when they start with
their chest workouts they'll do incline
dumbbell press or incline barbell press
something that'll require stabilization
but later in the workout they'll just
get on a cable machine or just get on a
stack machine for presses
and just rock it right because at that
point your stability etc is
out the window but the machine doesn't
require it right so taking
all that together straight sets which
require a lot of those things to be
their best
down sets which require a lot of those
things to be the best and giant sets
should predominate earlier in the
session when
your absolute strength is the highest
right like that's when you want to hit
your set of 8 pr and stiff legged
deadlifts not after you've done a bunch
of my rep work for your hamstrings
and the pr is nice but your faster
fibers aren't even being hardly
recruited
right that's when your faster fibers are
being recruited and that's when
technique is the best
on the other hand supersets rest pauses
and all the other stuff that trains more
the slower twitch fibers etc does not
require stability and technique nearly
as much
and to be honest is so mentally
difficult and so
so it zonks you out so much that doing
anything after
may just make that stuff suck afterwards
like after
five by eight straight sets in the squat
you can do a drop set of leg presses
and fundamentally that's a great workout
you can still do a good job in that drop
set of leg presses but if you did a drop
set of leg presses first and really
pushed yourself
the five by eight squats later are gonna
have to be such lower load and it's not
even clear what they're accomplishing at
that point if you even get through them
right so supersets and rest past sets of
all kinds
uh my reps drop sets occlusion should be
done on average later in the workout and
notice this is
not a hard rule there are good reasons
especially in some more advanced lifters
for some of these things to flip or for
some middle grounds to develop but
if all of your workouts or most of your
workouts start with supersets and rest
pause stuff and they end
with uh compound heavy movements uh with
straight sets
maybe not the best idea in the world so
give that some thought
next up variation by rep range do we
impose
all of these uh training modalities in
the same rep range the answer is
absolutely not for very good reasons so
straight sets can be done in all ranges
but sets of 20 to 30 are often iffy
because of the fact that you only get to
approach failure once and there's so
many lead in reps
if you really want to use a lighter load
get tons of volume in
but approach failure a bunch of times
during that time and get fewer lead in
reps which are not as effective
you might as well do something like maya
reps where you do
10 to 20 and then you rest a little bit
and do 5 to 10 and then do 5 to 10 and
then do 5 to 10
then ends up cranking up the volume the
load is low so fundamentally you get
almost exactly the same effect
as a straight set for 20 or 30 reps you
get in one to two minor upsets
but there's not as many lead in reps
there's more high quality reps there's
more
close to failure driving there's more
metabolite stimulus it's all the good
stuff that you really want
and it's not nearly as boring here's
another one it doesn't nearly take as
much time so it's all sort of the
benefits so if you're doing straight
sets
five to ten excellent 10 to 20 excellent
20 to 30 totally fine
but you might want to consider doing
drop sets or um
any kind of my reps or any kind of rest
pause training
and potentially you can even do um
some agonist supersets uh to make up for
the the sort of grinding boredom of
regular straight sets of 20 to 30 reps
down sets uh down sets you can use in
the 5 to 10 10 20 range for sure there's
a problem in the 20 to 30
that remember that when we talk about
sets of higher than 30 reps
close to failure might not be as
effective because they're not heavy
enough
that's fresh on a straight set okay
if you've done five sets of squats
already and you want to do another so
let's say leg process which is
compatible with a 20 30 rep range
if you've done five sets of leg presses
in the 20 to 30 rep range already
and then you do a down set in the 20 to
30 rep range by reducing the weight
then you're already fatigued and that
downset if you hit 30 reps and fail at
it
that's actually considerably lighter
than for that movement
your whatever 30 percent of your 1rm or
40 whatever that is
so it's technically a little bit outside
that range already so straight sets is
totally fine to do sets of 20 to 30 reps
mathematically but with down sets you
kind of have to be careful
because you could be exiting down sets
with very high reps could just be
junky volume and you'll probably clue in
on this yourself
when you're doing a down set of 25 30
reps or something
and your training partner looks at you
and they're like is it challenging and
you're like i don't know man it just
feels like i'm doing a lot of work for
really not much
then you might be doing weights that are
too light might not be a great idea
giant sets sets remember where you do
you know
well good heart set rest and then you do
as many reps as it takes like that with
mini breaks in between or regular breaks
rather
five to ten range is totally fine to do
them although a lot of giant set work is
focused on
perfecting technique and five sets of
five to ten are great for technique but
maybe a bit too heavy for that 10 to 20
is nearly ideal
for those uh sets of giant sets but
failure proximity is really important
that a 20 30 rep range
that rep range is only very effective if
you really push pretty close to failure
and with giant sets the point isn't to
push close to fear it's actually the
opposite
the point is to stay a little bit far
away from failures so that you can focus
on technique and mind muscle connection
so
sets of 20 to 30 is giant sets maybe not
the greatest thing in the world because
yeah you get a lot of reps but the
number of effective reps or the fraction
of effective reps
through that whole giant set tends to be
not very very high
right agonist supersets pretty
straightforward 10 to 20 and 20 30 loads
why
because if you do sets of 5 to ten in
agony supersets it really doesn't
accomplish a whole lot of metabolite
generation
and it doesn't do anything we want a lot
of times agony supersets are done
in order to enhance the mind muscle
connection for the exercise or for the
muscle that we want you know we have
trouble
feeling our triceps on close grip bench
so we might do some uh
cable push downs right before so that's
a 5 to 10 g you know you might not
really
have the time to develop a mind muscle
connection and furthermore
it might be such a high degree of
tension on all body structures that
you're just trying to move the weight
and you're trying to survive so agony
super sets
maybe not the greatest thing in the
world to do super super heavy but 10 to
20 and 20 30 is fine
again that 20 to 30 load if you're doing
a second exercise or even a first
exercise
make sure that if it's later in the
workout that
reflects the actual you know rm zone
and and not just the number of reps you
could do when you're super super
fatigued
so that means that if you're doing cable
push downs
don't necessarily do the first set for
20 to 30 if the cable push downs are
occurring
later in your workout 10 to 20 might be
the highest you want to go
because any higher would be less than 30
percent of your 1rm so on and so forth
rest pause a pretty straightforward 10
to 20 for the most part and some 20 to
30 loads
and that includes my reps drop sets and
occlusion uh for drop sets you have to
be careful again like we've been talking
about
dipping below 30 rep max so for example
on bicep curl uh cable bicep curl drop
sets
what can happen is know you start out
doing a hard set of 15
and you lower the weight hard side of 10
lower the weight hard set of eight lower
the weight heart set of eight
after a while you lower the weight so
much that you're just sort of moving
and if you've trained with someone
before and try to get them to go to
failure but you realize they always have
more reps in the tank
that's probably because they've dropped
to such a low weight that they're slower
twitch fibers or predominant ones active
and they can refresh between like a one
second drop of weight like if you just
put the weight down for a second you
just milk three or four more reps out of
them
that's way below 30 and 40 percent of
1rm and
probably not very hypertrophic so be
careful doing drop sets
there's only so many drop sets you could
do until you need to take a break and
maybe take another run at it
before it becomes an exercise in
futility an exercise is just showing off
your slow twitch fibers
next up variation by fiber
type so straight sets it's pretty simple
the fiber type
utilization or stimulus probably comes
very proxy to the loading range so it's
a five to ten a very fast rich fiber
heavy
sets of 20 30 or a good max or sorry
sets of 10 to 20 are a good mix
in sets of 20 to 30 probably a bit more
biased towards slower twitch fibers
down sets uh probably favor faster
fibers although the rep ranges you can
still expand the same way
but downsets favor faster fibers because
if you did any kind of drop sets or any
kind of occlusion that would be no good
for them
sometimes you need more volume but you
can't get enough reps so for example
downsets that are great for faster
fibers would be you have already done
you know four sets of five to ten reps
in the stuff like deadlift and you can't
hit sets of five anymore you're too
fatigued
dropping the weight down 10 20 can still
let you put in
good work of sets of 5 to 10 again
hitting those faster twitch fibers one
more time
giant sets have no clear bias and it
really depends on
rep range of failure proximity i would
say they're probably pretty intermediate
to that
and again you're not really using giant
sets to hit a specific fiber type you
use them to enhance the mind muscle
connection
and improve technique to a great extent
agonist supersets
because that second set the compound set
after the isolation set
is usually pushing the muscles really
really far
beyond failure so to speak where they
normally would have stopped with the
first
exercise by then your faster fibers are
very likely not very active because
remember they fatigue very early
and they are inundated with metabolites
and nervous system fatigue and at that
point
they might not even be contributing a
whole lot so it turns out agony
supersets are a really good way to train
intermediate fibers and slow twitch
fibers
not the greatest thing in the world for
faster fiber focus
rest pauses very similarly all likely
favor slower twitch fibers
because the faster twitch fibers fatigue
so early in the sentence nothing wrong
with that
because you have a crapload of
intermediate and slower twitch fibers
and they grow and they grow much bigger
so just thinking that muscle growth is
fast twitch only targeting
is not the best idea in the world so you
absolutely need
rest pauses and all those other stuff to
maximize hypertrophy that being said
you've probably heard before old gym
lore that like you know you built most
of your size through straights that's
heavy
that's probably true because most of
your size if you're the average person
comes from faster church fiber growth
that's the best way to grow them
but peppering in at the end of workouts
when your slower trick fibers are the
ones really contributing most of the
work and in a way that doesn't interfere
with the faster twitch fiber work you
did earlier peppering in these rest
pause
my reps drop sets occlusions and some
antagonists are sorry against supersets
is probably a good idea
right so the take over here is that
faster fiber dominant muscles are best
served
by straight sets and heavy down sets
really straightforward think of
you know hamstring training think of
chest training for most people
and then intermediate slower fibers are
best served by other methods which again
goes to the point that you know a lot of
people discover
maya rep sets and drop sets and
occlusions think oh these are advanced
these are very fancy ways to train
i should be training like this and they
may be first two years of their career
they came up doing
heavy straight sets and they get a lot
of size and they discover these other
super techniques and they think oh wow
like these are the training methods that
are really going to take me to the next
level
where that's not really the case it
turns out that those are things that are
more icing on the cake than the
fundamental thing it builds you so
for most of your work especially as a
beginner intermediate straight sets are
very very difficult to beat
because they give enough of a rest for
and use enough load for faster
fibers to really really thrive that
doesn't mean faster fibers don't grow at
all from any other stuff but they grow a
little bit less
you want to save that stuff for later in
the workout when you need it
all right variation by goal
when you step into the gym or when you
do a particular exercise or particular
training method
you may have a different sub goal other
than just pure hypertrophy for example
if you're training in a rush you want to
maximize your stimulus to time ratio
antagonist supersets are actually the
best where you do like
you know a set of bench presses and a
set of pull-ups instead of bench press a
set of pull-ups
that for sure maximizes time it's not
the best way to get the absolute highest
hypertrophy it's not the way to uh to
maximize your raw stimulus magnitude
but for much time it takes it's by far
the best str method
agonist supersets are also super cool
because you might not want to train
chest and back at the same time
you think okay i've got like 15 minutes
i got to smash my triceps
you're doing a whole lot of supersets
you can get a great workout in a very
short time now of course if you had more
time
and you took more rest brakes and so on
and so forth your fasteners your fibers
would get hit more
other things except for the target
muscle would be less of a limiting
factor you would have a better total
workout
but it would take too long and if you
don't have the time the best workout you
can get isn't just a fraction of that
better total workout
you can use things like agony supersets
and of course all of the rest pause
variations
to get over workouts so for example i've
had to
when traveling uh getting you know
sometimes the gym
that you're traveling to say you're
another country or another state
and you know they say oh the gym closes
at 10 p.m and you get there and it turns
it's a fucking holiday in spain you had
no idea and they're like oh
listen so the gym closes at eight and
eight pm you got there at 7 30 because
you had a leg workout you're like
fuck i have to train quads i've got i'll
move hamster tomorrow and i gotta train
quads in 30 minutes how the hell am i
supposed to do that well that's actually
pretty straightforward
you do my rep leg extensions and you
walk your ass over to leg press you put
on light weight you do
my rep leg press with one drop set at
the end where you take off the
you know let's say 100 kilos you take
off 20 kilos on each side you do one
drop set uh
and then you know after that you go
right into squats technically making the
leg press and first squats at the super
set
and then you do squats for straight sets
until the gym closes
and holy crap your quads are fried is
that a great way to train them all the
time no
it biases a little bit more towards the
slower twitch fibers and maybe doesn't
let you
really dig deep and activate the super
high threshold motor units for which you
need lots of warm-ups lots of rest
between sets
lots of compound really technique heavy
exercise but since you couldn't do it
there's nothing wrong with doing it the
other way
right certainly that way i just
described of training legs in 30 minutes
is way better
than like just getting through your
squat warm-up and doing one actual
working set
that's dog shit it's one of those things
like if you have to
invest if you have to half two and a
half hours to get the best out of the
workout
a fraction that may do nothing at all
right it's like if you're uh
if you're designing a plane for the
military and they need it
in six months you may design a plane
that works okay
but you know is not the best plane in
the world but just happens to be able to
be doable in six months
and someone could say like well why not
just design planes like that all the
time well if you give me three years
i can do a ton tons of wind tunnel
testing and have you a way better plane
but if i tried to do that in six months
we'd be halfway
through wind tunnel testing in the
military be like so where's our plane be
like well
the thing is we actually have nothing
you can fly yet
same idea as if you're really trying to
save time for workouts simply cutting
great workouts in fractions it may
render them completely useless if not
mostly useless
right next goal next little sub goal if
you want to improve technique
this is a big deal folks a lot of times
you'll notice that you'll get yourself
into situations or this is kind of where
we all start when we're beginners
if you're moving a muscle you're moving
the movement you're doing the squats
you're doing the lat pulldowns
i mean you have no idea if your
technique is really that great
somebody taught it to you you learned it
on youtube maybe you have a trainer or a
training partner
and you're kind of like chasing ego and
the technique is slipping a bit or
you're really like
you really just want to focus more on
techniques you can lock it in
and establish a really good pattern or
re-establish a good pattern if you've
let it drift away
or you see a new technique on a youtube
video like fuck that's how i should be
doing lap hold ons that's brilliant
and you want to try it you don't just
put it into your program and progress it
like normal because you have to have
some breathing room
some time to focus on the technique so
what do you do downsets are great
right downsets is less weight you
already potentiated from the heavy sets
now it's time to make maybe try a new uh
slightly different technique for example
if you want to bring in your squat
stance a little closer maybe kind of
weird to do with your top set weights
right you might have to lower the
weights a lot then the stimulus isn't as
good stick to your normal width stance
for four sets of squats and then the
last two sets of squats out of six
drop the weight significantly to do down
sets narrow the stance
you already warmed up a ton from squats
the weight's not going to feel weird and
shoulders then you can explore how the
narrow stance works get used to it
after a month of only doing down sets of
narrow
squats you'll be really really used to
them i mean excellent exercise for you
you could like you know what this is
great
now next motorcycle i'm going to put
them as working sets so downsets are
excellent time to practice some
technique on exercises you might not be
familiar with or variations of that
exercise and so on and so forth
giant sets are almost exclusively
designed for this
giant sets of psychological 30 total
reps on lateral raises it does not
matter if i get close to failure in a
set i don't even have to barely
you know count my reps i can set up my
video camera to account them for me
all i have to do is make sure every
single rep is quality as hell
and there's no pressure for me to get
some rar or to beat a previous rep pr
from last week because that could be a
thing right
you know yeah you had all the best
intentions but you have to get a set of
10 with the laterals at 20 pounds and
everything after set of eight is like
some kind of dog shit technique we're
just trying to survive
with giant sets that's not an issue
because there's no pressure any number
of reps you don't get in this set you
just do more in the next
one the next the next until you get to
your total number so giant sets
are excellent perhaps the best for
technique improvement
occlusion sets can work like this as
well for the big reason that they're so
light occlusion sets often are 20 of 1rm
and look if you're cheating and doing
shitty technique in an occlusion set
holy crap you need a psychotherapist
you don't need anything in the gym
occlusion sets are a great time to
really slow the movement down
really focus on the mind muscle
connection and it's easy on the mind
muscle connection too because occlusion
sets
make your muscles feel really really
tense and really high pressured
in the actual target muscle because of
the occlusion
and you get a proximity to failure
effect that lasts longer like you can
grind closer to failure
for like multiple reps like holy crap
this all feels weird but it feels weird
in that perfect way
of letting you target what you want to
target so the technique improvements can
really be tailored to make sure you
enhance your mind muscle connection
which is our next thing if very similar
to technique you want to enhance mind
muscle connection
down sets are great right when you plug
yourself into the leg press to do sets
of 5 to 10 or whatever
mind muscle connection always good to
keep in mind because remember you want
to perceive tension in the target muscle
in this case the quads
but at some point you lock your
technique in is fucking go
right good technique and move that
weight don't worry too much about
perceiving tension because that can take
away from your mental effort
of actually pushing the weight that's
the most important thing by far
but when you drop the weight a lot of
times
because you've been training heavy the
potentiation is huge you can actually
feel the mind muscle connection better
and because it's lighter weight there's
not a ton of pressure on you
to have to focus on trying super hard
you can focus on trying hard
and okay perceiving your quads moving
got it okay that
is what my quads now i feel the tension
now i feel the uh the burn so on and so
forth so down sets are excellent
agonist supersets are excellent because
they can pre-burn or pre-fatigue a
muscle
you normally have trouble feeling so if
on a close grip bench you really have
trouble connecting your triceps because
your pecs always get tired
if you do cable push-downs right before
and then you get a close script you're
like oh my god
i feel all of my triceps at the same
time and then you can play around with
the technique
related technique my muscle connection
to feel them even more so
when i go down here to my tummy i don't
feel a big stretch in triceps at the
bottom
but when i go just above the nipple line
oh my god my triceps are bursting this
is great so agony supersets are awesome
for mind muscle connection improvement
and giant sets of course as well
and uh it says especially when the load
is between
five to ten reps here so if you want to
improve the mind muscle connection
you don't want a ton of fatigue to be uh
something that occurs so it sets a 20 to
30 so it says five to ten i'm going to
change that in a sec so when you guys
see it it's gonna be five to ten
and ten to twenty if you do giant sets
and they get you into the 20 30 rep
range that just starts to be painful
and there's tons of metabolites
accumulated and you're sort of like just
getting the work done
but if you want a high mind muscle
connection sets a five to ten
even depending on the movement uh
because you can really focus and really
cue yourself and not have to get tired
and sets of 10 to 20 are excellent for a
giant set
lastly our sub goal could be major
volume boosting
like you need way more volume for a
muscle group that's just not responding
and you realize it's
very not sensitive to volume how can we
do this
in a time efficient manner especially
agonist supersets
holy crap right if you do straight sets
of five to ten reps
for your triceps and overhead extensions
and they're not very sensitive to volume
you could be doing
18 or 20 sets per workout and barely
feel a thing so total number of
repetitions is just not that high on the
other hand
if you do overhead extensions super set
to incline dumbbell press
that is a crapload of triceps volume in
just
one superset you do five or six of those
together oh my god that adds up the
volume quick
the flip side of that is if you are very
sensitive to volume in a muscle group do
not do
four agonist supersets in your first
week of something people do that all the
time
remember from a couple lectures ago we
count supersets as essentially one and a
half times the volume for both stimulus
and fatigue of regular sets
they can catch up with you quick the
last thing you want to do
is say you have very very sensitive
biceps to volume
and you try a bicep superset and you do
like oh well supersets like i did four
sets last
mesocycle and bicep curls i'll do four
supersets this time
your biceps fall off your body you're
sore for like a week and a half
don't do that ease into them but if you
really need volume they're a great way
to put in volume and all of the other
rest pause variations are as well
the volume summation of a maya rep set
really really catches on super quick
because if you do
traditional rest uh sets straight sets
you know you do a set and add some
volume and you rest a long time and you
do another set
it's just a very inefficient way to get
super super high volumes in
but if you do my reps you know you
get on the lat pull down or do my reps
or the cable run do my reps
you know after five minutes of work
you've done like a hundred reps
that's crazy which is to say right gift
in the curse it's double-edged sword if
you're very sensitive to volume be very
careful
because you're like oh well this is just
one buyer upset even though it's five
right it could get you way way over the
azure volume but if you really need a
volume boost
these are the things to go to
all right lastly variations
to use for injury risk management
okay this is specifically if you've had
an injury to a joint or connective
tissue or to the muscle you're training
and you're really trying not to
aggravate it
or you're in a pre-contest prep period
and you're super dry
you're super fatigued your technique is
off and you really want to save yourself
you know what
i cannot afford to get regular training
because like
injuries are a regular part of training
in your off season you'll get hurt a
little bit you'll get a
a bump or a bruise here and there you'll
take a couple
weeks away from that exercise or one and
a half weeks off of training that muscle
group entirely
it'll heal completely you'll come back
ramp up like nothing ever happened and
you'll get great gains
but like three weeks before your show
that might not be a good idea or forget
show three weeks before you have to go
on the beach and present your new beach
bod to all your new friends
you might want to take a little bit of
an intentionally lower injury risk
approach and of course the trade-off
there is the absolute results won't be
as good
but you won't get hurt in that proximity
of time
so you can do a better job displaying
your physique or making sure to finish
the training cycle
or like we said earlier preventing a
muscle from becoming re-injured when
you're coming back to it so for example
straight sets are okay but definitely at
the higher rep ranges you don't want to
have
you know you you tore your quad a little
bit a couple months ago and now you're
doing sets of five to ten heavy in the
squat coming back
not a good idea the absolute forces are
too high higher rep ranges is totally
fine for straight sets but there's
probably better ways of doing things
more down sets and fewer top sets is a
really really good way
so if for example you know you sort of
like strain your pack a little bit
and you're getting into straight sets
again like feeling pretty good
maybe do like two or three heavy top
sets and then do more down sets
as opposed to the other way around
because your tendons
remember they're mostly responsive to
very high forces
maybe lower the force a little bit add
some more reps that might be a better
trade-off your chance of getting hurt
on a very heavy set or a little bit
higher than they are on a very light set
so if you do more light sets and fewer
heavy sets
you actually might be doing yourself a
favor with sort of proactive or reactive
injury risk
giant sets are okay right especially if
getting closer to failure reactivates
your injury some folks
they'll have a knee injury right and
what they'll do is
as they get closer to failure there
tends to be some instability and they
tend to start using other muscles and
pulling and pushing around the joint
and that makes their knee that they just
hurt a while ago and it's recovering
much worse off they're all holy shit
like okay this i really feel this in my
knee and not a great weight
for them they may be able to stop
considerably short of failure but make
up for that by doing more reps you say
okay
i was going to do four sets in the leg
press it's going to be it was going to
be roughly 60 reps
total but they were going to be very
close to failure or i can just do giant
sets of leg press and do 80 total reps
but like stop three or four reps shy of
failure on every single set or even four
or five
that way you still get great work it's
not as efficient but it hits your
muscles up without getting you that
close to failure
that really risks injury just a little
bit more
drop sets great for injury management if
if the high forces are a problem because
it reduces load really quickly
and you can really try hard but since
it's a light load it doesn't really
matter all that much
agonist supersets are really awesome
because they reduce the joint loads
right for example you hurt your back a
little bit
from deadlifting or squatting and
anything over
oh you know 70 percent of your under up
max really just does not do good things
for your back now eventually you'll heal
and it'll be perfectly fine but for the
next several months
you really want to stay away from that
well you don't want to do
you know sets of you know 30 in the
squat at sixty percent water remember 65
percent one or m because remember that's
cardiovascularly and synergistically and
actually
and so on and so forth nervous system uh
limiting factor and then the muscle
target the quads doesn't really get the
best workout like that right
so what you can do is add into supersets
you do leg presses or leg extensions
before your squats and then you do
squats and all of a sudden the quads are
a limiting factor but you're using a
huge
you're using that 60 to 65 1rm but you
don't if you do 20 or 30 reps unless
your lungs are leaning factor
you can do sets of you know 5 to 15 reps
and everything is going straight to the
quads not ideal
if you're not hurt nothing beats heavier
squats but
if you can't do heavier squats agony
supersets for example are a really good
way to go around this and it applies to
every single muscle group right
if you if your shoulder's a little bit
messed up and you can't do heavy close
grip bench for triceps
do some skull crushers first and then go
to like close grip bench very similar
effect for triceps without as much
absolute joint stress
and thus risk of re-injury and lastly
occlusion training is the tip of the
spear
for injury management low risk training
if you just
screwed yourself up we actually
recommend like post surgery
once you get your relatively normal
mobility back you start with occlusion
training because it's the lowest forces
by long shot and still gives you robust
hypertrophy eventually
you take the occlusion off and you go to
other forms and eventually get back into
straights at work and heavy work and so
on and so forth
so folks give that some thought and just
remember in the back of your head
all of the training methods are like a
buffet for you to use
to get as jacked as you can but not all
of them mix super well with each other
and not all of them are for every
occasion right
you don't serve calamari at a
five-year-old's birthday party
and you don't serve you know like cake
with icing and a huge clown face on it
at the dinner party for new york
financial people
so it's kind of the same idea with these
training methods they're all really good
but some of them are best used in some
places and some in
others folks thank you for tuning in
we'll see you for the next lecture
