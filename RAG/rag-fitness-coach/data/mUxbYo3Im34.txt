barbell overhead standing press
tips and mistakes remember the target of
the overhead barbell press
front delts primarily also lots of upper
pecs
also some side delt triceps as well as a
big big hit for heavy tricep loading and
you actually get some trap involvement
as well i'm here
with joey sat mary of sat strength and
lion's den gym
just to be clear of some youtube
comments coming up no
we don't like each other
the first mistake so to speak of the
standing barbell press is actually not a
mistake at all
it's the myth that you have to do this
exercise
to get ultimate shoulder size or
ultimate strength development in general
and for sure optimal hypertrophy seated
barbell presses are
probably better it hurts me to say this
because i've done so much overhead
pressing myself and i love the exercise
they're probably better once you get
really strong if you're pressing
80 kilos or more overhead for wraps
which is like i don't know
something like 160 180 190.
once you get into those poundages there
is a ton of systemic and axial fatigue
developed
from your spine having to stabilize and
your legs having to activate under all
that loading
anyone who has done heavy shoulder
presses for rep standing can tell you
it's a whole body hit cool but we could
be using that systemic fatigue
generated from other training like rows
and squats and everything else we only
have so much fatigue we can take for the
whole body
let's limit it let's sit down on a bench
on just like a seat and do barbell
seated presses
for once you get super strong but until
you get super strong
it's a great overall development
exercise and if you still want to do
them
lighter weight and higher reps standing
when you are super strong that is
totally fine
next mistake on the overhead barbell
press is
failure to move your head backwards to
give room for the bar
to actually touch your clavicles and
stay close to your face some people just
keep their head relaxed and keep it
forward
they have to arc the bar around their
face which hugely decreases how much
force you can produce
to the target muscles destabilizes you
and honestly a lot of times doesn't even
feel good for the shoulder joints joey
show us how that looks people just think
overhead pressing is just straight
you know just standing normal so this
big arc and
notice their head doesn't ever move what
you want is
as the bar comes down go ahead and start
with it up joy start start with the bar
all the way at lockout
and as the head comes down you want to
move oh sorry as the bar comes down you
want to move the head back
perfect almost straight line and then as
it comes you want to move
it forward that cadence is great because
it keeps the bar
close to the center of gravity you just
move your head
right out of the way you don't want to
arc around with hundreds of pounds
you want the movement to be more up and
down
next mistake is essentially not moving
your head forward and pushing the bar
back
as you lock out each rep that allows you
to bring the bar closer to your center
of gravity
and it allows you to exert much more
tension and
have much more stability so some folks
when they press the bar
joey go ahead and press it just press it
up and out a little bit
so you're never really so go ahead all
the way to lockout and you can
leave their head exactly where it is
notice that he's coming forward a little
bit
it takes tension through the muscles to
actually keep this position
thus the driving tension has to be less
instead what he's going to do is
come all the way down and as he goes up
he's going to push the bar back as soon
as he clears his head
his head is going to dip forward now can
you do the super crazy as my first day
weightlifting
head bob super forward thing don't do
that there's nothing magical back there
that happens
notice he even loses a lock in his
elbows it's a gentle
subtle thing on the way down you want
your head to move back
keeping the bar close and then on the
way up as soon as you clear your head
you want to just dip down and push the
bar back
next mistake is collapsing at your chest
on the bottom especially
and letting the barbell drift really far
forward in front of your face
if you retract your shoulder blades a
little bit proudly push your chest up
you have an excellent shelf and you have
the power of your upper chest
to help you shoulder press also it's
probably better for your shoulder joints
and by keeping the bar really close to
you you actually put it into a huge
mechanical advantage
the further out it goes the less
advantage there is so people start
shoulder pressing wrong
to keep the bar out front like that and
they'll press and go ahead and do a full
range of motion
and the ball will be really far in front
of their face and all of a sudden there
and sometimes joe you're doing it too
correctly let your shoulders collapse
forward at the bottom
yeah you don't have to go like that but
put the bar here
uh he's even hard to do and you've been
he's been an olympic weightlifter for
years you can't even do it
so you're really like people end up sort
of like yeah crunching at the bottom
don't do any of that the right way is to
start right at your clavicles
nice and proud chest up you notice that
chest he's going to touch his upper
chest at the beginning
and then he's going to press keeping
that bar close to his face
how close the closer to better don't
jack your chin up but if the bar grazes
your nose
you're in a real good position
the eccentric phase the lowering of the
barbell press
is brutal but that brutality
is stimulating your muscles to grow does
it make it tougher
yes does it require more effort yes
can you use less weight a few reps
totally but it's worth it because you're
here to grow muscle
not to show off so because you are not
an olympic weightlifter and if you are
this video does not apply to you
when you shoulder press you should not
be doing this
he's going to get a good press on the
way up and then he's just going to let
it drop
and a good press and he's going to let
it drop weight lifters can do stuff like
that
what you're going to do is control the
eccentric as well that doesn't mean five
seconds
one to three seconds is fine whatever
you like but control
all the way through all the way up and
all the way down
and control on the way up and control
the way down perfect
next mistake is a two-parter but they're
so related we put them into one
not doing a full range of motion and
doing inconsistent range of motion on
every rep
the point of the shoulder press is not
to just do something that looks like
you're pressing
the point of the shoulder press is to
have a standard now if you are not
flexible enough to touch your clavicles
that's totally fine
you should go as low as your body is
capable of going ideally and for the
vast majority of people out there
the shoulder press begins touching your
clavicles and it ends with a
full lockout overhead joey can you show
us what a really good shoulder pus looks
like starts at the clavicles
and he's going to lock out overhead and
back down
and lock out overhead is the lockout
tough yes
are pump reps easier yes you are not
here for easy
you're here for proper julie do some
bodybuilder style dumbass pump reps in
front of your face yeah brother
that's how it's at some number of reps
we don't know what
but you did that you did some weight
don't do that
the shoulder press is incredibly
humbling you may not be nearly as strong
as you thought
if you're using proper technique not all
of us are joining us
viscous here's the deal do your best
because if you start to with your
technique
and start to have two specific problems
you are going to get
tons more systemic fatigue on increased
chance of injury especially
if you do these techniques wrong for
really no more gains
in the upper body muscles that you want
to train with the overhead barbell press
the first problem is people turn into
someone a different exercise called a
push press
can you please do a standard barbell
press strict
actual strict barbell press excellent
okay now do a weightlifting style push
press
different exercise boom the push press
intentionally uses momentum from the
legs do another couple more of those
in order to clear the bottom part of the
press which is the hardest
and it's more weight it's an assistance
lift for weightlifting movements and
it's a main lift in strong man
competition the thing is
you're not a weightlifter or a strong
man or at the time you're not training
it you're training it for hypertrophy so
you do only strict
another problem people do is they lean a
ton and then they end up pressing like
that
folks first of all there's no way to
standardize that some days you lean more
some less
and also it's probably not that great
for the hips in the back i've personally
hurt my ass eye joints a bunch leaning
too much so what you want to do
is do the shoulder press completely
correctly if you want to do the lean if
you get a good feel from that just do
a close grip incline barbell press the
shoulder press means no leg drive
no crazy lean stand nice and upright
chest up
your lower body's dead to the world move
the bar go ahead and do a correct
technique joey
all the way up and down under control
that's it
next mistake is way too much strictness
in the exercise and an official level of
strictness
that ends up not thinking at all about
center of gravity change
and proper positioning for keeping the
bar close to your center of gravity and
close to its best mechanical advantage
so here's the deal
joey could see a youtube instructional
by someone weak who's never pressed
and just keep his head in the same
position and just try to press like that
and notice the bar has to sort of go
around his head and he can't use a whole
lot of weight because he's making almost
no adjustments
ideally joey is going to keep his head
further back at the bottom of the press
and as he presses he's going to dip his
head through notice that does mean
especially when he's going heavy
that his upper body will be leaning a
little bit forward at the top
and leaning a little back at the bottom
there is not a damn thing wrong with
that
there is something wrong with trying to
stay completely rigid and upright and
having to go around
your what an awkward movement he could
use one fraction of the weight
it's actually worse for the shoulders
and everything else bad it's okay to
have a bit of natural sway
as long as you're doing everything
correctly and you're not intentionally
cheating and pushing
next mistake is thinking there are grips
or hand positions that are magical
for the standing overhead barbell press
the thing is
there aren't it's all personal
preference based on the following things
can you take the bar through as full of
a range of motion as possible ideally
clavicle all the way to lockout
secondly does it bother your joints at
all and
lastly do you feel it in the target
muscles that last one's really not a big
deal because if you can do a full range
of motion
and it doesn't bother your joints you'll
almost certainly feel it in the target
muscles
but there's a bit of leeway there as to
which position
is best for an individual so joey might
be a wide grip presser
he might like grabbing wide and that's
maybe where he gets the best feel
and the joints are doing the best then
he feels at the most in his front delts
or
he could be a close grip presser some
people legitimately press really well at
this grip joey's too jacked to
be able to do that
and anything in between is 100 fine
so when people ask the question of
what's the ideal shoulder position or
hand position
for this exercise there's literally no
right answer to that
start with something just outside of
shoulder width and then play around
over the weeks over the months to see
where you feel at best
that's it
last mistake is actually not going too
heavy or too late it's just going too
late it turns out there's no two heavy
barbell presses
for hypertrophy anything north of five
reps all the way up to 10 in that heavy
range works super super well
10 to 20 reps usually works really well
anything north of 20 reps in that 20 to
30 range for barbell process
unfortunately
is a lot of times just turning into a
core stability exercise
this isn't the hard part it's keeping
your upper body upright and keeping your
legs stable
it just tires you the hell out if you're
gonna do high reps
four front delton presses that's what
machines are for smith machine
regular machine seated dumbbell presses
that's much better suited for high reps
for shoulder presses i would ideally
keep it in the 5 to 15 rep range
all the way up to 20 is totally fine
give that some thought if you can do
higher up shoulder presses standing
it doesn't bother the rest of you and it
really fries your upper body hey awesome
most folks won't find that to be the
case folks
is this a nice box look at this box so
boxy it's even box color
it's almost the ideal box anyway thanks
for tuning in
for the shoulder press tips and tricks
video
if you have any questions shoot them in
the comments if you know the answer to
some questions please help out your
fellow youtubers
if you want us to do another exercise of
anything to do with hypertrophy training
shoot that into the comments we'll get
to it eventually we have a huge laundry
list of exercises to do
we're going to get to all the exercises
you want to see unless they're stupid
and if you put a stupid exercise you're
a stupid person you should feel bad for
yourself
folks thank you so much see you next
