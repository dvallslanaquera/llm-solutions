these are great this is a great exercise
I think in order to train to be able to
do more pull-ups and in order to get a
limited equipment situation of back
hypertrophy at home what I would like to
see is her actually eliminate that few
seconds of top hold at the top as soon
as she gets up to the top start even
more slowly than she's doing coming all
the way down holding at the bottom for a
little bit re jumping and hitting up
another rep again emphasis on the
Ecentric and on the contraction at
longer muscle length rep than
shorter
