hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
our new series strength training
myths and this is video number one you
need to max out
to get stronger let's take a look at
this myth first we're going to define
strength very specifically then we're
going to ask the question does
maxing out doing one rep maxes actually
work to increase strength
then we're going to ask the question of
like well what else works if that works
as well and then we're going to talk
about the final sort of big piece of the
puzzle is what is actually the best
approach
if we want to enhance our strength the
most
possible so we can define strength in a
bunch of different ways but the major
way
is the ability to produce high levels of
force
and one repetition max testing
or exhibition is absolutely the greatest
way to
demonstrate that but do we have to train
like that
to increase our strength and if we do
is that the only thing that increases
strength or are there other things that
increase strength because a lot of guys
will say
that you've got to do max singles if you
want to get strong bruh
bruh bruh bro the original bro the
original and best
so they'll make claims like that and it
sounds tough it sounds cool it sounds
hardcore
but how true really is it so first
question here is
does maxing out work to increase
strength well sure as hell doesn't hurt
it definitely will make you stronger in
some special situations it's absolutely
not the best way to go
if you're a very advanced athlete
sometimes it can be under stimulative to
actually do singles and too much
fatigue we'll get to that in a bit more
specifically sometimes if you're injured
or you have an injury history
you have to do more sub maximal training
because you can't do maximal training
consistently anymore
because it irritates structures too much
and gets you hurt but for the most part
if average lifters do lots of heavy
singles that absolutely will cause
a an increase in strength notice i
didn't say the biggest increase in
strength
so it definitely works because it has to
it's the peak of specificity
i mean you're literally training exactly
what it is you're going to be getting
ready for it's got to do something and
it absolutely does
however there are other ways to gain
strength
okay and a great way to gain strength is
to do repetitions
not just max's sets of three to six reps
and an rpe
of like seven to ten somewhere on
average eight and a half rpe
you can do a lot of things first that
weight on your back a seven to ten rpe
set of three to six
reps is absolutely heavy enough it
provides enough tension
to stimulate strength adaptations very
very robustly
because in order to get stronger you
have to train heavy
and sets of three to six an rp of seven
to ten is absolutely heavy enough
but there are other benefits because
you're doing multiple reps per set
let's say a set of five each repetition
is heavy enough to cause a stimulus
but you don't just do one because in a
single in a max single you do one rep
which is a good deal
of tension stimulus and you stop and
that was a set you did one repetition of
really good stimulus maybe let's say
that much stimulus and that's good and
you stop right
a set of five for example at an rpe8
may give you this much stimulus okay
less
than that single at whatever 100
or 97 5 but there's five of them shits
and each one gives you a stimulus now if
you add up the total stimulus of each
one of those
five it's way way bigger because
there's so much of that stimulus because
you're doing multiple reps
the message to the cells to the nervous
system etc to the structures
to increase strength is really really
large
generally larger than any one set of a
single
even if it's the heaviest weight you can
do can actually give you
right however here's the really cool
thing
a set of three to six repetitions hard
heavy is generally about as fatiguing
as a set of just one maximum repetition
oh hold on a second how does that make
sense a set of five has to be more
fatiguing than a single
well a set of five really does beat you
up but a real true max single
i mean good god that is a real all-out
effort it will fatigue you
a lot it turns out to be relatively
comparable amount of fatigue there's
some complicated variables there for
some people in some situations
one could have more one could have less
but it's generally comparable same sort
of order of magnitude
however remember that the stimulus from
the set of three to six
is way higher because it layers the
multiple reps and each one
stimulates strength on its own we only
just get one rep in the single
so the stimulus to fatigue ratio of a
set of three to six
at seven to ten rpe is usually
pretty much higher significantly higher
in many cases
than the stimulus to fatigue ratio of
just one reps if you're building a
really good training program
you want to squeeze in as much stimulus
as you can for as little fatigue as you
can because fatigue
is finite you can only accumulate so
much until it starts to mess up your
program
if you're trying to get strong doing
mostly sets of three to six
is just better than doing lots of
singles because it'll give you more
stimulus make you stronger
with less or actually equivalent fatigue
if you ratio the sets one to one
and then over the course of a mesocycle
let's say last four or five weeks before
you deload
you get this much stimulus and this much
fatigue
whereas with just singles you get this
much stimulus and that much same amount
of fatigue
it's just not as good it doesn't make
you as strong in the long run
right and most people figure this out at
some point in the strength training
journey
that sets of 3-6 just increase 1rm
strength
better than sets of just one rep
especially in the long term
of weeks and months there's a
specificity effect where when you're
right about to compete
sets of one to three reps are absolutely
better because they prepare you for that
exact task
general underlying strength the stuff
that'll carry you really far
is better increased with sets of three
to six than singles now does that mean
we don't really do
any singles ever it doesn't and here's
where we get to our best approach
best of all worlds singles are not the
best way to increase strength in the
long term with consistent
month in month out training too much
fatigue for the stimulus
and it's not a sustainable a sense of
three to six never mind the injury risk
which is another layer on top of that
singles are a little bit more dangerous
than sets of five or something like that
however within several weeks
of doing mostly sets of one to three
reps many of them can be singles
your nervous system and your technique
align for
maximum force production in that one rep
it's the ultimate example of specificity
you can be very generally strong from an
awesome foundation of such a three to
six
but it doesn't matter how generally
strong you are at the power lifting meet
it only matters how much you can
actually lift one rep and that
tail end last several weeks of practice
should be done
often with heavy singles an analogy here
is you know you essentially practice
whatever performance you want to show
off
many people don't know this about me but
i was a select member of many
global dance troupes when i was a child
usually interpretive dance sometimes
modern
and we in dance class didn't always
practice
the final year and dance recital every
single day that's ridiculous worked on
tons of stuff
and then but the last couple of weeks
before the big show
you practice the big show just like a
power lifter
make sure to build a great base but look
a few weeks out a month out or so
from an actual power lead you had better
get used to doing
doubles triples and a lot of singles
because that's where you're going to be
tested
even if it's not the best way to
increase your global strength the
specific strength
needs to be practiced if you're awesome
at such a 3-6 you can do well in a meet
but not your absolute very best
by the way how many of you guys believe
that i was actually a dancer i
fucking danced to save my life but i am
a great compulsive liar
and i wasn't a compulsive lying team
before what in any case
to increase strength the best that you
can
mostly train in the three to six rep
range
that's what increases your basic core
strength
and then one to two months depending on
certain circumstances before you want to
show it off
be that in the gym or in a meet you
start to pepper in more and more sets of
three
sets of two and maximum singles so that
by the time you step on the platform or
into the gym to do your best single
you're absolutely ready and you didn't
spend the entire year peaking
you spent the rest of the year building
strength and now you're able to show it
off
your absolute best folks i wish you best
in your training
and if you ever want tips about how to
be an awesome dancer
just uh comment below
