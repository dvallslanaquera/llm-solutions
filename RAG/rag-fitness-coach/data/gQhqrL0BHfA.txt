what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and today a highly requested video i'm
going to be giving you my thoughts
on the training advice and the various
or i should say pretty much endless
different exercise variations put out by
ryan humiston
hummus town so do i think that his style
of training is ideal
if your goal is to maximize muscle
growth as a natural lifter
now just a preface uh this is not meant
as some sort of a call out video or
intended as any sort of personal attack
um this is just my honest critique of
ryan's training methodology with the
goal being to help you
get the very best results possible uh
ryan does have a pretty large audience
and his advice
ultimately reaches millions of people
and so i think that this is a relevant
subject to address and many of my
subscribers
have asked for my thoughts on his
content as well so if you're not
familiar with ryan
he's a bodybuilding youtuber his videos
have really taken off in popularity over
the past year
and the vast majority of his channel
probably like 9 out of 10 videos
is basically him in the gym training a
certain muscle group and demonstrating a
bunch of
what you could call unorthodox exercise
variations
that he says will produce better results
than just using the basic conventional
lifts
i went through nearly every single one
of his videos to make this video
to make sure that i had a really clear
idea of what he's all about and i just
played him on double speed
and he very very rarely shows himself
performing conventional exercises
using what would be the regularly
accepted form
most of the time it's him putting his
body in all these different awkward
positions and using a modified angle and
a shortened range of motion
in order to get a better contraction in
the target muscle that's kind of like
his whole thing it's all about the mind
muscle connection and maximizing the
contraction
and if you're looking for a good
drinking game with your buddies put on a
ryan hummiston video
and then take a shot every time he says
the word contraction
now this one's all about the contraction
now as you start to contract see if you
can peek out the contraction that way
and i got a better contraction overall
the most intense part of the contraction
you get that contraction or finishing
contraction off as you're contracting up
and then start the contraction up i can
pretty much guarantee you have a better
contraction what's the best way to
contract that lower part of your chest
and
really peek out the contraction and
getting more out of the contraction and
the best ways to do that are by slowing
down the contraction and make sure
you're leading the contraction with your
elbow that way you can really focus on
the contraction
and contract that lower pack even more
there's no question that this style of
content is very
very effective people love this stuff
especially beginners people love seeing
someone with an impressive physique
in the gym demonstrating fancy exercises
that they've never seen anywhere else
it goes against the grain it stands out
from the norm and it makes every video
feel like you're uncovering all these
special little game-changing hacks
that are going to speed up your results
generally speaking the more unique and
the more
never before seen the exercise
variations and workouts that someone
posts are
the better it will perform in terms of
clicks and views and attention but
what's the main issue here in my opinion
the issue is that something being
innovative and unique
might seem engaging and seem great on
the surface especially when it's being
done by someone who really looks the
part
who speaks confidently who has good
video production value and i'm not
saying that you should never experiment
with unconventional lifts and i'm not
saying that ryan doesn't put out
certain exercise variations or tips that
could be of use to you
however it's very important to keep in
mind that something being
unique and against the grain does not
necessarily mean that it's more
effective
the goal here is bottom line results and
generally speaking
i would say that basing the bulk of your
training approach around the overall
style that ryan recommends
is not what's going to actually produce
the best results in the real world
assuming you are a natural trainee
particularly if you are a novice
and that's exactly what the vast
majority of people watching youtube
fitness content are
they are beginner to intermediate
natural lifters which is not the camp
that ryan is in okay he's coming from a
much different position than the vast
majority of his viewers
and it does seem that most of his advice
is based on his own personal experience
and taking what works for him and then
prescribing that to the lifting
population at large
if you are a natural novice lifter you
don't need to be performing the super
long list of special
modified exercise variations you
shouldn't be constantly mixing your
workouts up every week
you probably won't get maximum
hypertrophy on a high volume
single body part focus bro split you
don't need to be obsessing over the mind
muscle connection especially during big
compound exercises
and your training should not be
predominantly based around lightweight
high rep sets
using a shortened range of motion and
these are all of the things that
ryan hummingston essentially promotes
okay things that work very well for
advanced lifters
who are also using extra supplements in
their program and who have good genetics
but that are not going to be ideal for
the majority of the demographic who are
actually watching these
videos which again is the average novice
natural trainee
trying to add overall mass to their
frame as efficiently as possible
now keep in mind that any style of
training will add muscle to your frame
as long as you lift with sufficient
intensity volume and frequency and you
progressively overload your muscles
uh in some fashion on your exercises so
i'm not saying that his style of
training doesn't work
or that you can't incorporate certain
aspects of it into your program
there are probably plenty of people out
there who are getting good results by
following his content so i'm not saying
that it doesn't work
or that it can't be utilized to some
extent but what i
am saying is that if you're using this
type of approach as the cornerstone of
your training program
as the bulk of what you're doing in the
gym then you probably aren't going to
achieve the most efficient long-term
results
especially once someone is past the very
very beginning stages where they'll
basically grow no matter what they do
you know if you're a complete newbie and
it's just your first few weeks in the
gym
then you could probably do bicep curls
using your d as resistance
and still build some muscle that way
before i go any further if you do want
to grab a step-by-step training program
that you can follow
that is grounded in solid evidence-based
principles without any hyper gimmicks
involved

the most efficient way then make sure to

to let me know
and now let's go over some of these
points in more detail to give you a
better understanding of exactly how your
training program should be structured
for the very best results as a natural
lifter so
first off when it comes to exercise
selection you really don't need anything
fancy in order to achieve outstanding
results now there's of course
nothing wrong with experimenting and
tweaking your lifts a little bit to find
what feels best for your individual body
structure i actually
encourage you to do that but all in all
there's just no need to deviate away
from the basic proven compound exercises
performed with
standard conventional form we already
know that these lifts work extremely
well
they're safe and they can take you right
up close to your genetic potential on
their own
just as they've been doing for millions
of lifters for decades and decades
okay basic squat variations deadlifts
barbell or dumbbell chest presses
weighted pull-ups dips overhead presses
basic rowing movements
we really don't need to reinvent the
wheel here when it comes to exercise
selection
learn the proper form and the proper
technique on the basic compound lifts
train hard and progressively overload
them over time and you're going to make
all kinds of gains i'm making
all kinds of games
all kinds you don't need 15 different
exercise variations for one muscle group
putting your body in all these awkward
positions trying to hit every muscle
fiber from every conceivable angle
it makes for entertaining content but
it's really just not necessary in the
real world
if you've already got the basics down
and you just want to play around with
some of these
less conventional exercises on the side
to see if you discover something that
really seems to work well for you then
that's totally fine
but the core of your training should be
rooted in basic compound lifts
first and foremost and if i had a bit
money on it i would be very confident
that
ryan did not build the majority of his
physique doing all these fancy lifts
that he shows in his videos i would bet
you anything
that just like most big muscular dudes
out there he built the majority of his
physique using
basic progressive overload on the
compound lifts and then changed his
training style later on
after the majority of his muscle was
already built in fact if you go back to
his older videos
he actually encourages keeping things
simple and he says outright that the
tiny little details don't really matter
stop overthinking it when you start
tweaking everything and like oh is my
is my rep range right is my speed right
am i you know i'm going too fast am i
explosive enough
that little stuff doesn't matter just be
consistent don't overthink it
it's really that simple don't get stuck
in my new details
because at the end of the day they don't
matter what i think probably happened
is that he started putting out all these
unique unconventional lifts
his views and subscribers started taking
off as a result of it because again
people really love this style of content
and so he just kind of made that his
niche and ran with it and now that's
what people expect from him
and so he just has to keep coming up
with more and more of these unique
exercise variations
in order to keep things moving for
example at this point he has roughly 50
different bicep curling variations shown
on his channel
three bicep exercises you need to start
doing four bicep exercises you need to
do three bicep exercises you need for
growth how to get bigger biceps get
bigger biceps get bigger biceps faster
how to grow wider thicker biceps why
your biceps aren't growing bicep
exercises you're doing wrong
best dumbbell bicep exercises for
dumbbell bicep exercises bicep peaks
big bicep workout big arm workout arm
workout for bigger biceps get bigger
arms how to get bigger arms
how to get big freaking arms somehow
all of these different exercises hit
your biceps in some special unique way
that you don't want to miss out on and
maybe there is a parallel universe out
there somewhere
where this many different curling
variations is necessary to build big
biceps
or where you need to sit through 20
different videos to learn how to train a
relatively small and simple muscle group
like this
but i guarantee that in the universe
you're watching this video from right
now
that definitely is not the case in
reality probably
one to three different bicep curls is
all you're ever going to need
to max out your genetic potential and
the same can be said for all of your
other muscle groups as well
and comment below on this and let me
know your thoughts do you think a ton of
exercise variety
and using all these modified versions is
truly necessary to get great results
or do you think that the majority of a
person's muscle mass can be built by
just being consistent over time with the
basic
compound lifts comment below with your
opinion because i do in fact read every
single comment
and actually after posting this video i
came across an older youtube channel
where ryan posted three of his training
videos from 2012 and it definitely
provides
at least some evidence for what i was
just talking about these videos are back
from ryan's competitive bodybuilding
days when he was already absolutely
massive he looks even bigger than he is
now
and as you can see his training was
centered around basic heavy intense
compound lifts that he's gotten very
strong at through progressive overload
okay this is the reality
of how most people build up the majority
of their muscle mass by training hard
in lower to more moderate rep ranges and
focusing on adding weight to the bar
over time not through a bunch of fancy
exercises using light weight for high
reps
after the majority of someone's muscle
has already been built up then they're
pretty much free to train however they
want
but the initial physique is usually
achieved using basic
fundamental training principles now the
second thing he talks about
is how he constantly mixes up his
workouts and does something different
every time he goes to the gym
i've had a couple people comment and say
there's no way he changes the workout
every single time if you did that you
wouldn't get results well truthfully
i change it every single time now the
problem with this is that it's directly
counterproductive
when it comes to tracking progressive
overload and progressive overload
is the underlying driver of the entire
muscle building process
which again ryan does talk about in his
earlier videos i used to do this
intuitive style of training where i walk
in kind of guess the weight and it's
just crazy to me looking back because
i don't believe in intuitive eating so
why do i think intuitive training was
going to work
and it sounds crazy i've trained for 10
years and i only used a log book in
you know probably six months of that and
just started using it again
and i am amazed how much more progress
i've made so he stresses the importance
of tracking workouts
so that you can accurately improve your
lifting performance over time which i
100 agree with
but the issue is that when you're always
mixing your exercises around from week
to week
like he seems to recommend now you never
have anything concrete to measure your
progress against since all of the
variables are constantly changing
and so you're much more likely to just
end up running in circles without
realizing it
a way better approach especially for
novice lifters who are trying to build
up
a size and strength foundation as
quickly as possible is to have a
concrete program in place with the same
exercises
on the same days in the same order and
to work on maximizing your strength
progress on those lifts
for a consistent cycle of training
before you go ahead and switch to
another
consistent structured program when it's
necessary you'll progress a lot faster
that way
and by sticking to the basic
conventional lifts and keeping your
exercises consistent
it gives you a chance to really master
the foreman technique so that you get
really skilled at the key lifts
rather than just being mediocre at a
whole bunch of different mediocre lifts
the next thing he recommends are body
part focus bro splits
where you basically hit one or two
muscle groups with higher volume at a
time
rest those muscles for the entire week
and then repeat and for me no matter
what i do eventually out in the world
and did a lot of weird [ __ ]
i always come back to the bro split the
bro split is the best possible way to do
it
now i'm not saying that bro slits don't
work uh they obviously work for building
muscle as long as you train hard
with enough volume and you progressively
overload just like pretty much any
training split out there can work
i've used bro splits in the past
countless others have used them
successfully
and if you really really prefer a bro
split because you just enjoy it more
then knock yourself out okay i'm not one
of these people who thinks that bro
splits are complete garbage and that
they should never be used
however if we're talking about what will
produce the fastest and the most
efficient rate of overall progress
especially in the first few years of
training
then i would say that a bro split is not
ideal
because the weekly frequency per muscle
group is just too low
there's a limit on how much muscle
growth you can stimulate in one single
session you know you can't just do
100 sets for your quads and then rest
for an entire month while they keep
growing and growing
there's a cap per session where muscle
growth is going to be
maximally stimulated and then to where
additional volume just creates more
muscle damage
but not more net muscle growth so rather
than just
completely slapping the [ __ ] out of one
muscle group and then waiting an entire
week to recover
[Music]
you're going to be a lot better off by
reducing the volume per muscle group in
each session
so that you can get that maximum growth
stimulation without any extra
unnecessary damage
so that you can then recover faster so
that you can then hit
each muscle group more frequently and
create more total growth periods for the
month
and for the year and hitting each muscle
directly somewhere around i would say
one and a half to two times per week
that's usually what i would recommend
and the three standard templates that i
typically give people
that will work very well for most
lifters out there the ones that i
recommend in my complete body
transformation blueprint system which
i'll also link down below in the
description box
that is a full body workout three days
per week upper lower split three to four
days per week
or a legs push pull split four to five
days per week
those three layouts alone or even just
one or two of them
that's going to be enough to take you
from where you are now right up near
your genetic potential within a few
years
if you apply them correctly and then the
final thing he constantly stresses
is the idea of the mind muscle
connection and that it's crucial
that you feel the muscle working at all
times and the more you feel it
the better that's basically what all of
his exercise variations seem to be
centered around and even his
entire training approach in general
seems to be centered around this idea of
getting a better contraction but what
you have to keep in mind is that
the subjective sensation that you have
in your mind
of a muscle being activated doesn't
necessarily correlate to how much
mechanical tension that muscle is
actually under
in reality it's not the primary factor
that you need to be focusing on
when you are performing your exercises
instead the main focus
should be on proper form and technique
so training with proper form
and then generating maximum force
against that weight and getting close to
failure
while keeping that form consistent
if you select the proper exercises that
train the targeted muscle
through its anatomical functions and
you're using proper form throughout the
lift
then that muscle can't not work you know
if you do a bench press or a dumbbell
press
and your humerus moves from here to here
that's the function of the pecs the pecs
have to work in order to bring that
upper arm across your body regardless of
how much it feels like your chest is
working in your mind you know if you do
a squat
and your knee flexes in order to lower
the weight and then it extends in order
to lift the weight
your quads are working that is their
function in the exercise and actually
using that as an example how much do you
really feel your quads working during a
heavy set of squats you know based on my
experience
i don't do heavy squats anymore but when
i did do them for many years
i didn't really feel my quads working
that strongly during the exercise
it mostly just feels like you are
lifting a heavy ass weight using your
entire lower body in general
i wouldn't say there's a ton of
localized feel in the quads
but every experience lifter out there
knows that if you perform squats on a
consistent basis
and you just get stronger with them in
proper form your quads will grow
very very well they're probably the
single best exercise that you can do
you'll actually feel much more localized
mind muscle connection if you go ahead
and do a leg extension you know go do
some
high rep leg extensions to failure and
the mind muscle connection that you're
going to get is going to be insane your
quads will feel completely lit up
and i'm not saying that leg extensions
don't generate hypertrophy as well
but they clearly do not compare to
squats regardless of how much more
you subjectively feel your quads working
i mean another example
if i just sit here right now and if i
squeeze and flex my chest as hard as i
can
with no resistance whatsoever i'm going
to feel a very strong mental connection
to my pecs you know you can do this for
yourself it feels like it's working very
strongly
you know you'll get a burn and a pump if
you do this for long enough and you'll
probably get sore from it too
on the other hand if you go and do a
compound chest press let's say
a basic flat dumbbell press and you do
six reps to failure
you're not going to feel nearly as much
of a raw physical sensation in your pecs
so is this better for training your
chest than heavy dumbbell presses just
because you can feel it more
obviously not and then on top of this
very basic real world example
we also have several studies to back
this up too um i'll link a few in the
description box i'm not gonna go super
in depth here
but even in the research we mostly see
that when people try to focus on the
muscle
they're trying to work it doesn't
actually increase activation of the
targeted muscle
by the end of the set and some studies
even show that it reduces performance
and it reduces total work capacity
so again as long as you select the
appropriate movements and you put forth
a hard effort using proper technique
the targeted muscles are going to be
working you don't have to overly obsess
about this idea of feeling the muscle
and you'll be best off both in terms of
size and strength to just focus on
generating
maximum force against that weight and
getting close to failure while using
correct form
again i am not saying that the mind
muscle connection has no value
i'll talk more about that in detail in a
future video and if you do want to mix
in
some of the higher rep you know mind
muscle
maximum tension stuff on top of your
heavier progressive compound lifts
then that's totally fine but the bottom
line is that your entire
training plan should not be centered on
this idea of feeling the contraction
and then treating that as your primary
gauge for success

views on this subject
