welcome to the sixth video in this
series
now in this video i was 16 weeks out i
believe
um at this point it's been hard to
remember how many weeks out i am
just because i am a few weeks behind
with
recording and posting youtube videos
so i think this was 16 weeks out this
was my
third week of massing i believe
now for this video i wanted to address a
few things
first up how the masking phase went at
this point and in general
issues with short mass phases or blocks
then exercise selection tips for the
chest
bicep triceps and forearms those were
the body parts i was specializing on
during this short mass phase and so i
thought it would be helpful for me to
discuss
those body parts and exercise selection
for them specifically
so first up how the massing phase went
at this point
for the first few weeks i really
struggled to tell whether or not
i was in a deficit long story short i
came off medication
that made me less hungry than usual
um well specifically the medication
itself made me hungrier than usual and
so coming off of it
made me less hungry than i was
accustomed to
which meant coming out of this cut and
starting this mass phase
i had to switch my food choices a lot to
enable me to get in sufficient calories
to actually gain weight
which meant i switched from more
vegetable heavy
or less calorie dense foods to
more calorie dense foods in fact it got
to the point where
most of my meals were
what most people would consider almost
junk food just making sure i still get
enough protein in but otherwise
the main concern is being getting the
calories in
and so because that food is so
calorie-dense um
the food weight i was consuming so how
much actual weight i was eating as food
reduced by quite a substantial amount
which then meant it was hard to tell
whether or not i was gaining weight i
made an instagram post about this
a few weeks back now but essentially
because i
switched my food choices around so much
it made it very difficult to tell
whether or not i was gaining
tissue or not and so i sort of had to do
my best
to trust the process just get
insufficient calories and
ignore the scale for a few weeks and not
go crazy and
think i was ruining my progress
so yeah that's just sort of that's an
example of
a broader issue with short blocks or
short masking phases
which is that it can be very difficult
to tell whether or not you're
actually getting tissue because water
weight fluctuations can be large enough
to offset
those changes and so if you're not
careful
and or if you don't have enough data for
your diet as a whole
you can get into a situation where you
constantly increase calories increase
calories because you think you're not
getting weight
when in reality you're gaining weight
it's just a difference in water weight
and food weight that's happening and
masking that increase in um
tissue weight let's say and by tissue
weight i'm referring to muscle tissue
fat tissue and so forth
but yeah by the end of this mass spoiler
because i'm now in my maintenance phase
i did gain maybe around two kilograms of
actual tissue
in five weeks so that was fine um
but for the first two weeks i was really
uncertain as to whether i'd actually
gain
weight but sticking it out making sure i
got enough calories in
and trusting the process a little bit
did seem to help out overall
now i'll move on to discussing exercise
selection for the chest
the biceps the triceps and the forearms
again those were the body parts i was
specializing on during this masking
phase
in general with exercise selection as a
whole
not just for any specific body parts
there are a few things to consider and
make sure it's stable so if it's too
unstable like doing a squat and boost
ball for example
that might stop you from reaching uh
local muscular failure as far as force
production goes
and we know that's preferable to
unstable conditions for muscle growth
then the second thing would be
making sure you can adequately load it
so if you
let's say you can only do two reps of
bodyweight dips in that case
bodyweight dips just aren't a good
exercise for your chest because
you can't load them lightly enough to be
productive and vice versa if you have an
exercise
let's say you don't have any weights
available and you won't do squats for
your quads
if you can only do sets of if you have
to do sets of more than 50 reps to reach
failure
on squats with just your body weight
then those also likely aren't
a great option for growth so loading
stability
um range of motions another one
you probably want exercises that take
your
muscle group pocket muscle groups
through a pretty long range of motion
ideally that is especially true for the
stretched out portion so you want to
make sure that whatever exercise you're
picking
get you as deep of a stretch as you can
pain-free as in pain-free as far as
connective tissue is concerned
because getting a stretch on a muscle
group typically doesn't hurt a little
bit but
whatever exercises you wind up selecting
probably should
have a stretch component to them and
ideally would also have a pretty full
range of motion as far as the peak
contractions concerned
but it's likely from our current
understanding of
literature that getting a peak
contraction
isn't nearly as important as a deep
stretch
for muscle growth we know this from
the isometric train literature the range
of motion literature um
sort of mechanistic understanding of
passive inactive tension where passive
tension increases and increases as
much length increases but yeah so that's
the third consideration
range of motion uh ideally a
pretty big stretch component under
tension
and then you could consider stuff like
the fatigue components so certain
exercises just are more fatiguing than
others
and so while the stimulus they provide
is the same um
they may be more fatiguing and so if you
can only recover from so much fatigue
per week
you want to maximize how much stimulus
you're getting for that fatigue
which is why the stimulus fatigue ratio
component or
concept i suppose came from and so
an example here would be bent over face
pulls with free weights versus
standing face pulls with cables for
example
where bending over does fatigue your
core lower back hamstrings glutes a bit
more than just standing up
up straight um and in general being
seated down
does reduce fatigue for
synergistic synergists i guess
stabilizer muscle groups
as compared to uh standing up
and so generally speaking you wanna
[Music]
where possible
unless there's a proportional increase
in stimulus you want to avoid exercises
where you're standing up versus seated
and you want to avoid exercises where
you're bent over versus standing up
so for the chest specifically i think
with a lot of free weight exercises at
least border exercises
most people don't get quite as much of a
stretch on the chest as they would with
for example a machine fly
where they can get a really really good
stretch on the chest and so i think
including
a one exercise where you get a deep
stretch in your chest
which you don't really get that much
from um
through eight pressing is a good option
um i'd say typically between two and
four exercises for a chest is a good
start
you probably don't need more than four
because it's not a very complicated
muscle group
and so going above four doesn't really
do all that much
but below two poi also doesn't make
sense because there is an upper and
lower chest and they have slightly
different
functions and so if you want to get good
chest growth overall i think at least
two exercises is a good option
for the bicep from i guess for me
specifically in this mesocycle i did
close grip flat smith machining press as
you just saw and then some machine flies
some incline push-ups with deficit
and by incline i just mean mimicking an
incline press angle
incline push-ups machine flies smith
machine
press machine bench press and
[Music]
incline dumbbell press at a 45 degree
angle
overall just making sure you get a
decent amount of work in for both your
lower chest and upper chest
then for the bicep um one big
consideration
is selecting curl variations where your
bicep is more lengthened you accomplish
this by having your shoulder be
hyper extended or behind you like an
incline curl or bathing curl
a bayesian curl is just a curl on a
cable stack
where your shoulders behind you those
two exercises are pretty options for the
bicep because they place
more of a stretch on the long head the
short head doesn't
get impacted by shoulder position
because it only works to
flex the elbow but the long head
probably does get a bit more growth out
of
this exercise for example here which is
a hammer curl
well a hammer basin curl i suppose then
for the tricep i think
a lot of your tricep work should come
from isolation walk
this is because your
long hand of the tricep inserts the
shoulder
which means when you're doing compound
exercises for pressing the long head is
shortening
at the elbow but lengthening at the
shoulder which means it doesn't change
length that much
which means most compound pressing
exercises don't actually train
the long head through a full range of
motion quote-unquote and because it's
lengthening at one joint but shortening
at the other
it can't contribute that much force-wise
force production-wise
to the exercise and just doesn't get as
good of a stimulus from
those exercises as it does from
isolation exercises
and so if you're already doing compound
pressing exercises for your chest
i think most of your direct tricep will
actually come from isolation exercise
instead
specifically as with curls being
optimal when your shoulder is slightly
higher extended and placing more stretch
on your bicep
the same reasoning applies to the tricep
where
having your shoulder overhead so an
overhead extension with dumbbell with a
cable etc
places more of a stretch on the long
head of the tricep than
push downs or skull crushers push downs
place at least stretch on the long head
and skull crushers place an intermediate
amount of stretch
but overhead extensions place the most
stretch on the long head
and as with the short head of the bicep
the other two heads of the tricep aren't
impacted by shoulder position
because they only act at the elbow and
so they only do elbow extension
so whatever you do with your shoulder
doesn't impact how much growth or how
much stimulus they get
out of a trespass size and then finally
um for the forearms
i think there's really only
unless you're considering training the
wrist extensors which can be done
if you're really trying to optimize
forearm growth
like if forearm growth is one of your
primary concerns for some reason
whether it's you have really lagging
forearms or you just like the aesthetics
of it
i think mostly just training the wrist
flexors is a good idea
because that's where most of your bang
for buck time wise comes from
and so for the wrist flexors
specifically
are really only two considerations
whether you're doing standing wrist
curls or wrist curls on a bench
i vastly prefer wrist walls on a bench
you get more range of motion
you get a deeper stretch in your form
well wrist flexors um
you're not standing up which is a bit
less fatiguing
and the resistance cut is a lot better
because you
in a standing wrist curl with the bar in
your hands as you're standing or
dumbbells in your hands peak tension or
the hardest point in the exercise
typically occurs near the fully
contracted position
which is essentially the opposite what
you want for hypertrophy and so i think
most of the time
sticking to seated exercises for your
forearms
like a dumbbell wrist curls on a bench
or a
barbell wrist curl on a bench tends to
be a better option
so yeah those are my thoughts on
exercise selection for those body parts
i think
implements so cables versus dumbbells
versus barbells versus machines
and those mostly come down to
stimulus fatigue ratio as in what allows
you to get the most range of motion
what gives you a good pump a good my
muscle connection um
for example i typically steer away from
barbell benching personally because i
don't get as deep of a stretch on my
chest as i would from dumbbells or
machine
and i think that reasoning should be
applied to a lot of exercises
so what's another example
yeah so for overhead tricep extensions
if you do
dumbbell overhead tricep extensions with
both arms at the same time
so with one dumbbell typically most
people just don't get as if of a stretch
because the dumbbell hits their back
before they get a full stretch
and in that situation replacing that
exercise with
the unilateral dumbbell ovary extension
or with a cable
unilateral overhead extension just as
better because you get more respect in
your tricep
you get a full range of motion and so
overall the
stimulus fatigue ratio of the exercise
improves
and i think that's a good that's a
decent way of
selecting exercises uh for the bicep i
think
somewhere between two and five exercises
is sufficient and
they're not that complicated they don't
have that many functions
but because you bring a lot of volume
for them um
selecting more exercises can be
beneficial because you want to avoid
overuse injuries
for the triceps they are a bit more
complicated
but you're also performing fewer
typically fewer sets per week because
they have lower
mrvs and slightly lower meds
and so i think again two to five
exercises per week is a good range
finally for the forearms um
i think honestly one to three exercises
sufficient
um i've really run into
any overuse injuries from doing too many
wrist scrolls on
without sufficient excess variation and
very few people i've come across
have had that issue and so even though
you can do a lot of volume for your
wrist curls
per week um because the forms
well the wrist flexor specifically are
pretty straightforward
like they essentially just get a good
stimulus out of
flexing your wrist doing more than one
to three exercises isn't strictly
beneficial as far as growth is concerned
and because they don't
suffer high overuse injury rates it also
isn't necessary from an
injury prevention perspective
but yeah that essentially wraps up the
video i'm just finishing up with some
beijing curls as you can see i'm getting
a full stretch
on the way down by letting my shoulder
hyperextend
and yeah that's essentially a video
this video was 16 weeks out i hope you
enjoyed the video

subscribe let me know what you want
improved or done differently
i'll try and keep making these weekly
and i'll see you next week
